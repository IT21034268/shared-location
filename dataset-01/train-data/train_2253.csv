2,Just some thoughts about the audiobook version of the novel,"I read this book twice, first by actually reading it, and then by hearing it on audiocassette several months later. What struck me about this audiobook was that the reader, an actor whom I've never heard of (Alexander Adams), seems to give a better performance than any of the actors in the movie! He reads each of the characters' lines with perfect conviction, emotion, and resonance. I'm sure it helped that he wasn't under the supervision of a director whose bumper sticker must say, ""Two words: don't emote."""
1,Only as a reference book.,"One Star... Why? Two words: ""Terry Brooks"" I'm sorry... the man can't write. I once tried to slog through ""Sword of Shanara"" - and it was awful. Reading ""The Phantom Menace"" I got to the point where I was almost afaid to read the next paragraph... afraid of what he might do. Some of Brooks' descriptions are truly painful. There are a few places where useful technical information is imparted. If the book works at all it works as a reference. In places it serves to offer more data about the Star Wars universe and fill in gaps left by the movie. My advice? If you still want to read it - wait for the paperback."
2,Shouldn't have bothered,"This novelization is better than the movie, but it's still a shoddy book. Author Terry Brooks did the best he could with the cartoonish schlock he was given."
5,WELL DONE!,"I love this book! It covers everthing in the movie and so much more. It is more descriptive than the movie. And makes the movie better when you see it because you know more of Anikin's backround. It really fills in the gaps left out in the movie and Darth Maul doesn't say much but he says more then the ""yes master"" in the movie. The author does well describing the events so you get more of a feel of the settings even more than in the movie. Well Done!"
2,Disappointed,"Let's face it, all die-hard Star Wars fans are going to buy and read this book, but if we are truly honest with ourselves, the other Star Wars novels leave this one choking in the dust of Tatooine! I saw the movie (multiple times) I didn't really need to read the script, again. I wanted more, and it wasn't there. Maul came off so completely un-menacing in this novel, the descriptions were non-existent, and the action was completely boring. I had no emotions while reading this book at all. One saving grace, I did enjoy some of the fleshing out of Anaking and his dreams, but everyone else was left as 2-dimensional as a walking movie-character cut-out! Go back and see the film again, the book certainly doesnt add to the experience."
4,"excellent reading, much better then the film.","I found this book, interesting and kept my interest so much I hatted to put it down. It goes into detail with out loosing you from the story line. The book decribed the Jedi fight sence so well that I could actually picture them in my head, and that was before I saw the film. I recomend you read this as it fills in a few gaps about the Jedi past that helps you understand them better. In my opinion anyway!"
5,SW Episode 1 TPM isn't only a blockbuster on the big screen.,Star Wars - Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace is a great movie. Equally as great is the novelisation by Terry Brookes. The novel follows the movie very closely but has small extra bits added for even more atmosphere. And it works. For example the novel starts out with a pod race unlike the movie and features more dialogue and characters in Mos Espa.An excellent movie adaptation.
3,"It's a great movie-companion, but not a great book.","On the plus side, the book describes the action and events wonderfully, and paints great pictures of costumes and architectures. The book gives details about the nature of the force and the history of the Republic that are not available in the movie.On the negative side, the dialog is trite, the characters are unbelievable, and the emotions seem painted on only as a way to advance the plot.All in all, the book was mediocre as a Star Wars book, but is still indispensible to those wanting deeper insight into the events of the movie."
3,"Middle is great, beginning and ending stink","The second sentence is the single worst piece of writing I've ever read, and the beginning and end, as action-packed as they are, sound pretty boring as written. The middle is great, as are all the segments following Anakin (even at the beginning and ending). It seems like Anakin took up most of the author's skill, if not most of the attention. This makes the book very disjointed, so that even Jedi and Sith Lords seem pretty bland. You can't blame Terry Brooks, he had to roll this book out a.s.a.p. before the movies came out based on just a few viewings of the movie or readings of the script (maybe only one viewing or reading?), but even so, such an acclaimed author could have come up with something more smooth and scintillating."
3,A Better Story than the movie. Well-Written movie book!,"Episode I had many problems, poor script, poor actors and indifferent direction, but the novel by Terry Brooks was definately a highlight for the movie. A strong adaption of the Lucas screenplay, Brooks gives stunning insight into the world of the Star Wars prequal. His writing about the Sith and about a young Anakin give the reader a much better grasp of the story while providing a dynamic setting. Overall, it's a top notch effort and well worth the readers time. I would like to see Brooks write in the regular expanded universe some time soon."
3,A Fairly Good Adaptation,"In the book, Terry Brooks adds a little bit more then you see in the movie. Actually, the beginning of the book describes a scene entirely different from the movie, and this was a very nice touch.Brooks is very descriptive in his writing style, and the amount of detail used is phenominal. The story had a lot of different characters involved, and Brooks did a good job of making sure they all got their fair share of time in the sun.His use of dialogue is very appropriate as he never dwells on anything too long, and he adheres to the movie quite nicely. All in all, the book is a nice, quick read, and a definate must for all Star Wars fans."
3,It's OK...,"I generally will not read novels adapted from screenplays. They lack depth. This book is no different. You get a bit more information than what the movie reveals.This is my first Star Wars book. It was not so bad that I have decided never to read another Star Wars book. I am currently working on Rogue Planet which is much better. But hey, it is not based on a screenplay."
3,unsure,"as a fan of terry brooks' other books, i think he could have done a little more than he did with this book... aside from the podrace at the beginning, he did little to expand the content from the movie... it was well written, but far below his normal writings"
4,I Spake! therefore I am. 3.5 stars.,"This is a review of the unabridged audio book. Alexander Adams is doing much of the reading for the prequel books and does a great job. If you love SW and drive a lot like me, then you'll want to purchase this audio book.Like most people, I grimace at the mention of terms like ""chosen one"" and ""medichlorians"". By itself, this was an incomplete and partially unsatisfying movie. But when one reads the books that surround the events in TPM then revisits TPM one developes a greater appreciation of this book and movie.The book has a few things that fill in details left out of the movie, so I strongly recommend reading the book to fans of the movie."
3,Better than average movie adaptation,"You know you are in the hands of a capable writer when he manages to acheive the impossible: Making Jar Jar interesting.Terry Brooks takes time to flesh out characters and exposition. The reader is thankful for it, especially when it came to Darth Maul and the reasons why the Jedi Counsel had reservations about Anakin. Not to mention out of all the Star Wars novels out there, Brooks has been able to explain the force in practical and economic terms.The only downside: It's still a movie adaptation. No doubt those reading this review have seen the movie a few times. That's the problem. I found myself glancing over familiar bits of action in order to get to the exposition. The very same exposition why one would want to read the book in the first place. You will not be disappointed, enjoy."
4,Episode 1 is true to the Star Wars saga...,I'd have to say The Phantom Menace book is as wonderful as the movie. The characters are well developed and the plot moves with a speed and smoothness that makes this book very hard to put down.
5,Wow!,"If you are a Star Wars fanatic and love the Star Wars novel, then you will probably love this book. It's a book you will want to read over and over. As with any book, there are moments when it gets a little slow, but these moments last for only a couple pages. You will not want to put this novel down."
3,"Good story, bad author !","After reading many Star Wars novels I do not agree with the form of writing Brooks chose to use for this new edition in the Star Wars collection. In my opinion,it was flat and emotionless. I think they should have chosen a more experienced Star Wars novelist. I did, however, enjoy the book(storyline) immensely as far as the events and actions are concerned. I just think it ought to have had a little more emotion to it."
5,Starwars Rules,This book is so much more descriptive than the movie. It tells you alot more and I highly recommend reading the book THEN seeing it in the theater. But I guess the entire world's already seen the movie.
1,"Sorry to those who loved it, but...","Personally, I feel that the book was insufficient reading.a) I was adamently (sp?) hoping for a ""Knight of the Word"", ""Magic Kingdom of Landover"" or even another ""Shannara"" which was getting stale.b) While it won't stop me from watching to movie, oh no far from it, the story must have lost something. As is always the case, the original is ALWAYS better."
2,Fair Book.,This book is okay in some parts. But usually it's just boring. You're going to want to read it only one time. That's it.
4,Good book,"THIS Star Wars book was very good. I was glad that this was a simple book with the basics, not like some book where some nut is going to put a ring in a volcano(like Tolkin's The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings). I was surprised that Terry Brooks did such a good job on this one, and it was good and easy for kids. The only bad part was that it focused on Anakin too much."
4,Pure pleasure.,"In a recent gallup poll concerning religion, a significant number of people named ""Jedi"" as their religion. I grew up with Star Wars, fully understanding the adventures of Luke Skywalker before I knew the adventures of Jesus of Nazareth. And when I read that poll, something clicked. Who would have ever thought that Star Wars the trilogy was really just the conclusion to a much greater story about the story of none other than Darth Vader? This book follows the movie exactly, adding bonus insight into the Jedi religion and some back story that isn't given in the movie. Terry Brooks is not only a capable author, he's a great writer, not given to cliche or boring prose. All in all, I'd have to say that this book is a must read. I'm actually going on to read the original trilogy now."
3,An Adequate but Unexceptional Adaptation,"One reason to purchase a book adaptation of a movie is to learn more about the universe of such a movie, to learn more about the characters, and to get info on the motivations of the characters. Sadly, little of this is available in Terry Brooks' adaptation of 1999's top grossing film. Little is learned in this book that was not covered in the movie. This adaptation sheds less light on the events of the film than the average adaptation. Still, the story of ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace"" is presented in a an adequate manner.None of this is the fault of Brooks, who was clearly constrained by the restrictions set upon him by Lucasfilm and its mania for secrecy surrounding the release of the movie. The result is an unexceptionally written book, which fully tells the story of the movie, but offers nothing of additional substance."
1,Very disappointing,"I was quite disappointed in this book. I'd expected quite a bit, because I'm a big fan of both Brooks' Shannara and Magic Kingdom series, but unfortunately this book didn't live up to my expectations. I have a very hard time actually sitting down and reading this book (which is very rare for me!) My recommendation is that, unless you're going to buy this just because it's a Star Wars book and you want to have them, save your money - it's not really worth it."
4,BETTER THAN THE MOVIE,"I got a much better insight into the characters than I did from the film. The book, WAS better than the movie"
2,Disappointed...,"Being the biggest Sesame fan (yup, child of the 70s), I was so anxious to buy anything Sesame on DVD for my 16 month old daughter. She's nuts about all the DVDs we own (and so am I), but not this one. I found it quite lame, corny (Barney is supposed to be corny, not Sesame Street) and boring. Too many ""people"" in it with ""people"" skits interrupting Muppet skits. Sesame Street is nothing without the Muppets, so I found this DVD was filled with a lot of filler. With such high hopes for this one, it was only worth it for the Disco Grover skit which was worth 2 stars. We're selling ours [...]"
1,Disappointed that it's boring,"This is the only SS video that bored my toddlers. It bores me as well. It's very outdated. The one star I gave was for the Count's song I love. Other than that - save your $$, you can find many other great SS videos out there....My fav is Rock n Roll Sesame Street. Very clever and great songs for adults too."
3,Only if you are only enough to remember American Bandstand,"I rented this DVD to check it out before I purchased it for my 2 year old daughter. I am glad that I did.Personally, I really enjoyed the Grover disco number and the two Birdland songs a lot. As a mother that remembers American Bandstand, I also thought the set up was cute. For the nostalgic factor, however, I have to say that I like ""Put Down the Duckie"" better.My daughter, however, did not like the show at all. She kept bringing me other Sesame Street DVDs that she would rather see (e.g., Learning with Numbers, Rock & Roll, Sesame Street Karaoke, Get Up & Dance). Since the DVD is really meant for her, I guess that we won't be buying this one."
4,1969?!,"I bought this DVD because it said 1969 as the publication date. Don't be fooled.The DVD is pieces from different eras. There are a few bits that can be from 1969 (the disco scene, obviously!), but the live action scenes were from the 80's, judging by the way the clothes look.It's a nice video and my daughter seems to like it. Just don't buy this DVD if you want to go down memory lane with your kids!"
5,Sesame Songs - Dance Along! VHS Video,"Description from the back cover:Sesame Songs Home Video - All music! All Sesame Street! DANCE ALONG!Everyone's invited to the Sesame Street Dance Along! Join Big Bird, Gina, Mike and ""the kids"" as they show us ""A New Way to Walk"" with the Dinker Sisters. Learn the Transylvanian national dance when the Count teaches ""The Batty Bat"". Watch Bert demonstrate his favorite dance, ""Doin' the Pigeon."" Flap your wings to ""The Birdcall Boogie"" with Hoots the Owl and Big Bird. And do your own thing with ""The Any Way You Feel Dance."" All in all, there are nine terrific dances that are sure to make everyone want to Dance Along! From Children's Television Workshop, runs approximately 30 minutes, closed captioned."
5,My toddler loves it,"My son LOVES this video. I'm buying the DVD because the VHS I bought at a yard sale for a quarter has worn out. I first showed it to my son last year when he was about 15 months old. He actually screamed with delight and pointed to the television when the oinker sisters came on. (Granted, he didn't watch much tv, so they were pretty exciting looking) He is 2 1/2 now and still loves it."
2,the okay movie,Not the best movie we've seen but okay. I think that it was cheap made. I must say that this was the most borring movie even thoug there was lot of music in it.
1,Ridiculously hard to follow Step Aerobics DVD,"I've been doing advanced step at health clubs for 15 years and I am completely frustrated by this video. The choreography is so difficult and hard to follow. The preview section only instructs the viewer on 3-5 of the many crazy steps. Also, there are several skips on the cd that I cannot correct."
2,Awful Instructing. Poor Job with Cues.,"I did a lot of research before making this purchase. I wanted a really good step workout that would be advanced & not a boring workout. I had read reviews on the poor cuing, but some of the reviews said you could catch onto some of them with a lot of practice. Well, the workout is not as good and physically challenging as I was hoping, and the cuing & following is worse than I was expecting. I would certainly NOT recommend this workout."
1,Hard to follow,"I am an experienced ""stepper"", having done step aerobics for over 20 years, and these DVD's stumped me. I could not figure out what moves she was doing and how she got there. Very, very hard to follow."
2,Hard to follow along,"Just not paced well at all for a beginner. Not friendly for anyone hoping to follow along, and everything goes way too fast to even hope to be able to keep up. Seemed pretty generic overall too."
1,Honey I shrunk the clay!,"The shipping weight says 9 oz, but this is actually only 1.9 oz. If you zoom in on the image you can just barely make this out, but not something you would be likely to see - definitely deceptive advertising. The actual dimensions of the box shown are just over 1"" x 2"", and it's less than 1/2"" thick. (This will not work as Cranium replacement clay!)"
2,Expected more.,"The first I had heard of FDJ was on the soundtrack to HeavyMetal 2000 with their track ""Green Iron Fist"" which starts out with an intensely awesome bass riff, and then goes into a song that gave me a great first impression of the band. So I went out and got the CD and was sorely dissapointed by the fact that the entire album blows some serious chunks. Only second-long riffs are worthy enough to ""head-bang"" to and the rest of it is just a lurid display of slow crap that seeps out of the would-be heavy metal band labeled 'Full Devil Jacket'. If i had listened to the album first i would never have bought the silly thing in the first place."
3,nothing to write home about,"Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad CD. I just know that I've heard a lot better releases this year. This CD has a lot of good points, but I can get by without it. I picked it up to see if the studio work differed much from the live show. They played with Coal Chamber and Type O Negative and they just did not fit. The only song that really sticks in my head is Stain, but that's no reason to buy a whole CD. This album is worth it if you like alternative metal/rock. It's similar to Liquid Gang and Finger Eleven, but not quite as good."
2,"sappy, touchy-feely, uncreative","I had heard Wanna-Be Martyr on the Scream 3 album (by the way, it's a must-purchase) and I thought that this CD would be worth buying. When I did buy it, I enjoyed Mainline, Stain, and Mr. Wiggly (except for the editing, which makes a squeaking sound whenever Josh Brown says the f-word) along with Wanna-Be Martyr. However, the rest of the songs make them sound whiny, touchy-feely and miserably depressed. ""Where Did You Go"" disgusted me so much that I had to skip it every time that I heard it, and then the rest of the songs made me sick to my stomach and unhappy. What happened to the uplifting trends in metal? Why was Wanna-Be Martyr so unrepresentative of FDJ's style? This album left me with a lot of questions about Full Devil Jacket. I sold it because I knew that I wasn't going to listen to it unless I forced myself to."
4,"One shot, One Kill!","This band has to be the one of the most overlooked band's of all time. This was a great band until Joshua Brown (lead singer) nearly had an overdose and went to Christian Rock (Day of Fire). They were extremely innovative and energetic with their music. The album isn't put together to bad either, you start off with the hard-hitting ""Wanna Be Martyr"" and go to the extremely addictive ""Fastblack"". Probably the only song anyone has heard is ""Where Did You Go?"" which was a good mix-up for this album, why not throw in a nice ballad when the rest of the album is pissed off. The biggest asset for this album is it's diversity, you got your straight out metal with heavy effects i.e. ""Mainline"" and then you go to a pop song with ""Blue Green Day"". Needless to say, these guys were not sellouts, they were straight up underground and were true to their music. FDJ rules!"
5,Mbox is king!,"I've had this for over a year, among other equipment I bought off Amazon. It works excellently and I value it so much. The price was right too. It came with an iLok and a factory bundle. Seriously, if you want to buy stuff you can rely on, try Amazon. You've got all these reviews to help you decide on a product and Amazon gives great service. I'm so glad I bought this and many other things from them."
2,Disappointing,"I had high hopes for this book seeing as how it was done by National Geographic but the explanations for ""how things work"" lacked details. The language is elegant, but it does not tell you anything that you couldn't ascertain by simply using and observing these things in your everyday life."
1,I Was Not Pleased!,"Just another glossy coffe-table book. About 30 years ago there was a great informative book with same title, ""How Things Work"". That book gave detailed information, was one of our favorite books. It seems alll good thing are now 'dumbed down!Beshore in PA"
5,Great book for mechanical or science loving teens!,"I gave this book to a 11 year old boy for Christmas. He loves it! It is his favorite 'pick up once a week to learn something new book'. It is actually very clear and concise. For instance, me, the unmenchanical mind can understand it, yet it has enough depth that bright science crazed boys and the odd girl will love it."
3,Good but not thorough.,"I didn't get exactly what I needed out of this book. It's good as a reference, but I think it leaves out some information on different topics. The IPC section is a little skimpy, but then again it's not a book about IPC per se...some of the stuff the way it was written was not any more understandable than a manpage, and often you buy books hoping that they are worded less cryptically than manpages. On the upside, I got most of what I needed out of it."
4,Great book but lacks some vital information for IPC,"great info about pipe, shared memory. need some more work but overall good to have this book. It is sad that author of this book (GodFather of Unix) is no longer here. I learned very much from having this book. Some improvements have been made from earlier edition. This may not be the first book recommended for beginners."
4,Great Cabana ... for about 2 days!,"Sadly, I too found the Kwik Cabana III to be a terrific item ... the first time I set it up (inside our house, of course). When we actually took it to the beach and tried to open it up under ""real world"" conditions - Jersey shore in early September, and not particularly windy - one of the four support rods snapped at the top junction. We now own a $100 collection of poles and fabric, but not a cabana. It's too bad, because it's really a great design and so lightweight. Hopefully the manufacturer will design a stronger version (which I'd buy again)!"
4,Great Shelter from the hot sun!,"I purchased this unit 3 and a half years ago and didn't realize the size of it. Its much bigger than I expected and that's the best part about it. My wife and I and our two kids can fit inside there and take shelter from the sun for lunch, or whatever, as we usually take it to the beach, or set it up in the backyard when we are outside playing. When around other kids, it is a kid magnet as kids love going in and out. Kind of tough at the beach when trying to keep sand out, but it shakes out so easily that it is not a big deal.I highly recommend this over an umbrella or anything similar that I've seen. Its taken some abuse over nearly 4 years and is giving me a hard time to open and close recently. Its still quite serviceable and I love having it."
1,"Gory Film, DO NOT BUY FOR KIDS","THIS VIDEO IS NOT, I REPEAT NOT FOR KIDS, within the first 10 minutes you see a ""cute"" seal being eaten by a polar bear with blood all over the place and 10 minutes after that you see the Dad frozen in ice with a hideous face. Imagine explaining this gory imagery to your kids. I know you can't return movies but they should really take this one back. I turned the movie off after the Scary Frozen Dad Face and told my kids the movie was broken. This movie is really a normal wildlife adventure with fake lips slapped on and cheap music sold as a video for kids. They should be ashamed of themselves."
4,Great All Around Phone,"Let me start by saying I was not one to text before with the standard phones. But when i saw this phone I thought well I'll give it a try. To be honest I was not expecting much because I always thought texting was pointless on a phone. I thought how hard is it to use your phone as a phone. You know actually talk to someone. But, after I used this phone to text my wife a couple times I am sold. This is a great phone to text with. Yes the buttons are small, but I have not had any problems typing with it. I like how it is a flip phone. That way when I am actually talking on this phone the mouth piece is closer to my mouth. The only thing so far that I do not like is some applications only work when phoned is opened one way. Other then that i would recommend anyone who is on the fence about texting. Get this phone and you will be texting faster then you thought you could."
5,Richie D,"The thing I love most this phone besides the side flip out screen and easy keyboard for texting is the size and thickness of it.No bigger than a razor phone.No antenna sticking out is great too !I like the carbon fiber look wrapped around the outer screen.Both screens inner & outer very bright and colorful.Great reception anywhere.Mp3 works great as long as you get the music essential kit from verizon.Takes great pictures too ! They print out a little on the dark side,but nothing a good photo program cant fix.Battery life is great.I like the memory slot being on the side.Easy to get to.The wallpaper and ringtones are lame so plan on downloading some.All in all though an excellent phone.Love it !"
3,Finally got the stupid bluetooth working.,Major problems:1. Slips out of your hands because it's too thin.2. External speakers distort when using on a call.3. Can't see screen outside in sun.Finally got a bluetooth Plantronics 510 headset working with this phone (the plantronic 510 is probably the best headset made). It must have been a bad headset because it wouldn't call or hang up reliably. I exchanged the first 510 with a new one and now it's working much better. Now that I got that working I'd raise my star rating one star if I could. It is a very slick phone and bound to win a lot of people over even with the flaws.
2,50/50,"This book is at its best when it points out the errors and absurdities of the bible especially the old testament. Unfortunately the book is marred by a nasty sarcastic tone that will turn off a lot of people who really need to read a book like this. The book is at its weakest when it goes off on tangent at the end and starts talking about UFO's, NDE's etc. The author really loses some serious credibility with his lack of objectivism about these topics. Bottom line: this book didn't live up to its potential."
1,"sad, deluded individual","I truly feel sorry for the author of this book. This book is a ridiculous piece of trash, and is best utilized for starting fires."
4,Good test prep guide.,This is kind of a cliff notes for Calc III. It covers all the essential topics and equations and gives a couple examples of each. It is not really something most people can pick up and learn the entire course from. It is more of a guide to use as a review after lecture and while you are getting ready for exams. If you are allowed to use a page or notes on your exams this is perfect to use in creating one. I also found it helpful when doing homework problems because I found it far easier to navigate to the different concepts using this than trying to make heads or tails of what the textbook was saying. But I also had one of the worst multivariable calculus textbooks out there.
4,Great set of cables,"These cables greatly increased my listen quality, easy to hook up. I have a EQ and connected it to my Amp. Great product!!!"
3,It leaves streaks,"I can never seem to apply enough pressure to clean the algae, it comes of patchy, and it leaves the glass covered in very noticeable streaks."
3,Not As Advanced as you would Think,"I purchased this book along with ""Circuit Design with VHDL"" by Pedroni. The Pedroni book was supposed to help me with syntax issues and general knowledge of vhdl while I wanted this book to learn some more advanced techniques. I found the two books very similar in level of difficulty. Chapter 8 on the Design of Fast Arithmetic Units and the section in Chapter 5 about designing an LCD controler are about the only advanced topics in this book that teach you how to design in VHDL. The section on implementing a RISC Thumb processor is more of an arichitecture lesson than how to implement it in VHDL on a FPGA. This book is more of an intermediate book than an advanced one. This is a good book don't get me wrong its just not as advanced as I would have liked."
1,I was sent the wrong DVD,"I ordered the DVD of the 1994 FEDEX Orange Bowl and was sent the 2000 Sugar Bowl DVD. I did receive a return tag to send it back, but no way to talk to anyone. Great price, but was probably not worth saving a few bucks when you have to go through all the hassle just to get the correct product you ordered."
3,PC Annoyances,"It is good for Windows Systems thru XP but was written before Vista and is no good for thatPC Annoyances, Second Edition"
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"This book is so outdated as to be useless. It should be removed from sale. Written in 2002 and an alleged second edition in 2005, the latest Windows information included deals with XP service pack 2. You'll also find information on HOT topics like ""EUDORA"" etc. I probably would have found this useful, LIKE 8 YEARS AGO!!!"
3,"Helped some, not updated for my old Windows XP","Maybe because I had a copy of an earlier version, I was expecting the new edition to be more helpful. Some of the tips that should have been specific to my Windows XP, did not seem to be exactly correct. In other words, some things that I wanted to fix with the tips that this book promised didn't work. Maybe it was me, but I was a little disappointed. Some things did work and were probably worth the cost of the book."
5,A Handy Collection of Tips,"This books is suited to readers who have used PCs for some time--long enough to run into the annoyances referred to, but not long enough to have found solutions, at least to all of them. Almost half are found in Microsoft Windows, Office, or Windows Explorer. Others are from various email clients, Internet software, music/video, and hardware. Some examples: how to delete a ""file in use,"" how to quickly and safely remove a USB device without going through multiple dialogs (pp. 206-7), and how to add a short note to accompany a file (p. 163).There is also an interesting tip on single-use credit cards, for online shoppers and some tips related to Google.This is one of those books that can be read five minutes at a time, or from cover to cover. Perhaps the most effective way to use it is to at least skim the entire book, then later concentrate on the sections of interest. (If you don't use a particular program, tips on it's use probably won't interest you.)"
5,Better than Great,"It is impossible to know where to begin a review of this book. Multiple fixes to problems you have , but also to problems you did not even know that you had. I read the book in several days and picked up much that was useful.Since my initial read, I am now able to pick and choose the real important problems that exist and fix them pronto. Very nice writing style, that never talks down to the reader. I purchased the first edition when it was released, and loved it, but the 2nd edition is even better if you can believe it. For more Steve Bass, check out his PCWorld column, you will not be disappointed"
4,I used it my first day,"Not quite ""every"" teaching assignment will be enhanced, but this book is worth every penny. The Teacher Tips and a few forms are definetly geared toward elementary school, but I just made my own for middle and high school. The five-minute fillers have come in handy. I used the logic riddles the first day I substituted. If you are going to substitute teach you should have this book or something similar."
3,Substitute Teacher's Organizer,This is a good book for substitute teachers but a better and more comprehensive one for the money is Substitute Teacher Handbook.
3,Very Useful Book,I purchased this book because I began working as a substitute teacher this year. This book is extremely well organized. I love that all of the pages are already 3-hole-punched and easy to tear out. I did not use every single page but I am currently using several of them. I would not be nearly as organized as a substitute if it weren't for the suggestions in this book. Highly recommended.
5,A Must Read For the Substitute Teacher,"Whether you are a new or experienced Substitute Teacher, this book has excellent ideas. It helps organize your information on the schools you sub with, lesson plans, what to do in the event there are no lesson plans, it's an excellent book."
3,lots of ideas,I purchased this book after I signed up to be a substitute teacher and have used several of the ideas inside.
4,This had great information for a new substitute.,"This book had some good information on organization for a new substitute. For example, how to track jobs and expenses. It had the typical activities as well as some forms that could be duplicated. It is a good book for a beginning substitute."
4,Useful book for new subs,"This book has a lot of resources, although I chose not to create the binder exactly as suggested...some of the sections I felt were irrelevant and so I took some of the forms and teaching ideas and put them in a binder in my own way. Overall, a worthy purchase!"
2,Don't waste your money,"This book contained mostly forms to fill out and very few ""good"" ideas on substitute teaching."
2,Some Interesting Ideas,There are some interesting ideas in this book e.g. the Daily Schedules and Daily Summaries and I like the concept of having an Organizer especially for emergency teaching jobs.I liked the labels to help create your own folder. However it wasn't really what I was expecting and a lot of the information wasn't so relevant to me.
5,great buy,"I bought this car for my 4 year old grand daughter. She is thrilled.Within a few hours she was driving it well enough for us to take off the slow speed lock that it came with. The assembly took her grandfather quite a few hours, numerous decals were tedious.She loves having her own radio and CD. The neighbours kids love it and have a ball driving on both the lawn and the paved driveway.The latch on the doors is not hitching very well, but we shall see how we can fix that. All in all... great car, great buy and many smiling kids are thrilled!"
4,"very cute , and stylish battery operated vehicle with radio",i bought this for my daughter christmas 06' and she loves it..it is cute and works great.
5,IR Adapter Works with Vista/64,"Needed to sync my old Palm Tunsten with the laptop but after getting a new laptop found that Palm, nor any of it's successors, supported a USB connection to any 64 bit operating system. The only solution was using infrared. This dongle works like a charm with Vista/64. Haven't tested with Win7/64 but will soon."
1,Does not work on my Windows 7 64 bit,"I tried this as others suggested. It did install correctly--not using the supplied disc.It will not link with my palm Z22 with IR. I wrote cables unlimited and they confirmed it will not work with W7 64 bit. Not sure why others had success, wish I had similar results."
1,Not a good idea!,"This does not work with Windows Vista, and as far as I can determine there is no way to make it work. I searched for a web site to determine if there was a fix or updated software and could not find anything. So, I wouldn't suggest it."
3,"Works well, have to stop it before removing.","Just have to remember to use the ""Safely Remove Hardware"" icon from the system tray. If I don't it crashes the system about half the time. I'd give it five stars if I didn't have to do this.Other than that, it works perfectly. I've been using this one for over a year, linking to a Polar HRM Watch."
1,"Computer didn't recognize it, no drivers","I'm not sure where I went wrong here. According to other reviewers, it worked like a charm, but for me, it didn't work at allI can't find the divers on the web, and it didn't come with a cd-rom, I'm stuck with it, at least I only payed 10 bucks for it."
3,Works but...,I purchased this Irda Adapter so I could transfer my dive logs off my dive computer to my laptop. It works fine - but I gave this product 3 stars because the drivers are extremely slow to install and my laptop had difficulty reading the disc. I thought it was just my laptop but my fiance had the same problem. Otherwise - it works fine and is great for the price.
1,Cables Unlimited USB - Irda adapter is junk,"I was having difficulty synchronizing my Palm Tungsten E device to my Win 7 computer's Palm Desktop by Access. I tried everything I could, including following several advices on blogs. A couple of folks suggested this USB - IRDA adapter might work. So, I bought it and gave it a good try. It didn't work at all. This is a junk product from China with bare minimum and mostly ridiculous instructions. Returning was a hassle so I threw it in my old ""My Mistakes"" box."
1,unpredictable,"Well I concur with the people that say that this product is far from perfect. Incredibly finicky piece of equipment, deciding only when it feels like it to accept information. I would recommend spending a few extra bucks for something that is more consistent and works."
4,"Oops! Software didn't install and user's guide is horrible, but it works. :-)","In my previous review, I listed some problems with the IrDA device. Everything I said in my previous review is true, except I was able to sync my P/PC with the computer via IR. I just needed to look at the directions more carefully. So my new bottom line: If you want something that works well for really cheap, but don't mind not having their software installed and don't care about ill-written user's guides, then definitely go for this.I would have given 3.5 stars overall, so I'm kinda averaging it out with 4 stars."
1,Windows 7 Drivers Not Available Yet,Message from Cables Unlimited website dated 7 Feb 2010 in response to a user post: The factory and manufacturer of the chip used in USB-1510 is not compatible with Windows 7. If the issue can be resolved and a driver developed that will be stable in Windows 7 and Windows 7 64 we will remove the notice from the USB-1510 webpage that this is not compatible with Windows 7.
2,IR Dongle not ready for prime time in Windows 7 64 bit,"I purchased the IR Dongle to overcome the lack of a USB cable driver for the Palm Z22 PDA (And others) to work with the associated Desk Top (6.2.2) in the Windows 7 64Bit environment. I read a review on Amazon that said the IR Dongle would work, an it did work for a brief time, long enough for me to upload the data on the Z22 into the DT, but from there-on, the connections is dead. The Dongle works in the XP environment, so it isn't broken. Communicating with Cables Unlimited technical support I learn that the drive associated with Vista and Windows 7 isn't stable (in my case completely stopped working - in spit of several reloads).I do not recommend this device for use in a W7 environment."
2,Will not work with 64 bit computer,"I bought this hoping to synch my old Palm Pilots m515 and V with my new HP G-70 64-bit laptop. There is no driver to make the 64-bit platform work with the Palm Pilots.Cables Unlimited USB1510 USB Acc, USB To Irda Adapter"
2,Stopped working after a couple of uses,"I had an older cell phone with infrared, so I bought this infrared adapter when I got a new laptop with only blue tooth capabilities. Similar to what I had read in some reluctant reviews of this product, it took 15-20 minutes to install the software and get my computer to recognize the port (I have a Sony Vaio SZ740 with Vista and MS Professional).I was able to use the device a few times before it quit working for me. I could see in Explorer (Windows button + E) it was there, but my control panel infrared icon no longer recognized the adapter. Luckily I recently got a new phone with blue tooth and a micro SD card. I wouldn't recommend this adapter to a friend--I was hoping for a fairly cheap way to link my phone, but ended up with more headaches than it was worth."
1,"Absolutely, unequivocally, did not work","Tried for several hours on 2 different Vista PCs to get this thing up and running with a Polar F55 HRM. Same errors message on both machines no matter what process I used. No instructions for Vista on the (extremely outdated, poorly written) manuals on the disk and no instructions whatsoever on Cables Unlimited website even though they had a link for manuals. It just links to a blank page. The package stated Vista compatible but I would beg to differ.I can't recommend it. Due to the wide range of reviews I would have to come to the conclusion the product is not consistent. It even averages 2 out of 5 stars on its own website. I probably could make it work eventually but any product that requires one to jump through numerous hoops when it should be simple plug & play functionality is not worth the price.I already printed out my return label. Now I'm gonna roll back and scan both machines for walmare least their software sends personal info back to China."
1,DA wireless bridge,"Unfortunately, I have been unable to install this item. The instructions haven't been helpful.I am very disappointed."
4,Does what I bought it for,"I have a Nokia cell phone with a camera and an infrared interface. I downloaded free software from Nokia (called Nokia PC Suite), and now, with this simple Irda adapter, am able to get my laptop to manipulate the photos the cell phone takes and store a copy of the cell phone's address book."
1,bad publicity,I did not get what I paid for. They sent a USB to parallel cable instead!!. Too much trouble to send back. Will not buy from this vendor again!!
5,works well,"works well, use it with my polar axn 500 w/o problems. set up is easy. why pay for polars when this is the same thing?"
1,Jury is still out. Will fix rating pending outcome.,"I want to reserve a rating until this matter is resolved. I ordered an item from PC universe, through Amazon. I received the wrong item, and I had to return it by printing out a label and finding a UPS drop off location. I have never received the original item. I have contacted PC Universe about this, and I am awaiting a response. As it stands, this could be two coincidental things: wrong item sent, failure to send correct item, but I am still put out by having to drive somewhere to send it and having to print it out the label myself, which is a hassle if you don't have a functioning printer.Customer service was helpful otherwise.A better solution, and quite frankly is the response I was expecting, was to send the original item expidited with a return envelope for the incorrect item. How hard would that be?"
1,No Windows 7 drivers available,Sadly there is still no Windows 7 driver available for this so the product is quickly becoming useless as Windows 7 install-base is growing. I am using it in a Windows XP VMware machine to connect my Polar RS400d and it does get the job done in XP.It's just a shame that they aren't working on driver updates.
4,works with VMWare fusion and polar 625x,"This adapter has been working fine on my macbook pro (10.6) and vmware fusion, with the polar pro trainer software and my 625X heart rate monitor. Oddly enough I can't get the computer to talk to it in OS X, but it works fine in win XP."
3,So-so,Okay product. I used it to sync my Fossil Abacus wrist pda watch. The IR sync is very slow compared to the usb sync. I would not have bought this product if I knew it was going to be this slow. I went back to usb syncing.
5,"A definitive, clever look at the 80s!","I had the pleasure of working on this book and I can truly say it's one of the smartest and most hilariously written books that I've come across. I mean, a Steve Guttenberg logic question is nothing short of brilliant! I thought I knew a lot about the 80s but Mr. Sellers has me bested by a long shot. If you want to test your knowledge of short-lived TV shows and one-hit wonders, this is the book for you. Forget The Wedding Singer, the PCAT is the definite word on the glorious neon decade that was the 80s!"
4,Classic Bogart,The TCM Greatest Classic Legends Film Collection: Humphrey Bogart includes four Bogart lesser known classics. They Drive by Night has less of a role for Bogart and much more for Ida Lupino and is generally rated as the best of the four films. The other three are solid Bogart WWII films. The transfer quality is good and the collection is very much worth having.
2,Short & Sad!,"A far~fetched tale of a very young child being simply left on an old man who thinks the mother may return in a few hours, but soon finds differently, & also finds in a letter to him, that the child is his own grandchild from his own daughter who of course flew off to be with her man without introducing the child. The mother stays gone even longer than she said she would be gone originally, which is confirmed by another letter, While she is gone, things begin to happen. The least of which is, the aged grandfather entrusts the little girl to a boy he takes in off of the street, to help him out since he is losing some of his faculties, which I found too trusting, but hey, it's not my story. Over all it was too sad & a little short. It is supposed to be inspirational, which I found was a quality it seemed to lack, a little. Not one of my styles of book to read, although I do go for a truly inspirational novel."
5,LOVE THE WATCH.,This is a beautiful watch. I had it on my Amazon wish list for over a year. I procrastinated because of the price. When it was reduced I was notified by Amazon. This is a great service which I didn't realize was offered.
5,Perfect Alligator Molds,"These alligator molds produce super cute chocolate alligators. I made chocolate covered Oreos on sticks and placed these alligators on them. I did some with green colored chocolate and some with purple. They were slightly larger then the Oreo so I put them off to one side of the oreo and then wrote my daughter's name, ""Ally"" on the other side vertically using a chocolate pen type thing I purchased at Michaels. I displayed them at her 1st birthday party and they were a hit."
3,Shallow Music,"The music on this CD was not as deep or as rich as it should be. Maybe it was simplified on purpose. I have purchased other ""baby"" music, before, with much fuller sound."
4,good overview,"This book contains a good overview of maintenance that needs to be performed on a system. Probably should have been called ""Unix System Administration Tuning"""
4,Halloween Purchases,I like the product. The only thing I would like is to be able to download it to my computer and burn it onto a DVD. Is that possible?
4,"Enjoyable, Interesting Read About Curries","This was quite an interesting read. It gives an amazing amount of information about the period covered (essentially from the point at which Europeans landed), with some good insight into the cultural factors. I think a glossary would be helpful for American readers, who do not have as much basic information about India as Brits do. Still a very good read."
3,Great read!,"I bought this book after flipping through it in a store because of the interesting chapters about Indian food as adapted by immigrant cooks in Britain, the US, and other parts of the world. After all, don't we all eat in Indian restaurants in the West, and aren't we dying to know more about the history of these places? The author previously wrote a political history book about India so this is a spinoff on the subject of that great continent's food. The book itself is beautifully designed (font, illustrations, etc.) and a nice product. My only reservations are: (a) the chapters on Indian food in the West are the most revelatory in terms of research and commentary, (b) the chapters on Indian history are not that interesting (and not really about ""Curry""), and (c) I tried cooking the recipe for chicken tikka masala (there are recipes - of course - sprinked throughout) and it wasn't very authentic!"
3,Curry : A Tale of Cooks and Conquerors,Good book and great to know the history of curry cooking. Very good insight into the influences of multiple cuisines in the making of curry/indian cooking.Only wish the author had the ability to refrain from suggesting that british cooking(???) influenced Indian cooking. Reeks of snide arrogance as any sophisticated cooking is more than serving raw meat.
3,Serialised in the Sunday Times?,"This is just the kind of book that's serialised in the Sunday Times (the one printed in England).A potted history of India following the development of its culture and cuisine, hilariously brief in many parts.Rather than being a history of Indian cooking, it is more a history of the inrtoduction of Indian cuisine in English culture and the acceptance and development of Indian restaurant in England.Yes, the author does look into the evolution of the various schools of gastronomy in India, but it is all leading up to the focus on England and it's food culture. In all fairness the many interesting vignettes she comes up with, are quite interesting, but a history it is not.The recipes are interesting and I am sure to try them.Do not read this, expecting a serious history of Indian food."
4,Interesting book,"Well-written, exhaustively researched, and with a very interesting topi, this is an intriguing book. I enjoyed reading it, and getting an overall perspective on curry, to go with my exhaustive eating experiences both in the US and in India.If there were more recipes, I'd have given it 5 stars. If there were no recipes, I'd have given it 5 stars. I found in inclusion of only a few recipes distracting, hence the 4 stars."
5,Food as History,"If your first taste of India was in a high school world history class, where you struggled to engorge and disgorge the indigestible names and exploits of Mughals, rajahs, and viceroys, this book will cleanse your palate. Dr. Cunningham uses the story of the development of diverse modern Indian cuisine as a savory entree into the religious, ethnic, and political history of the subcontinent, much as Jules Tygiel uses baseball as a lens for studying America in his book ""Baseball As History."" Curry is indeed a compelling synecdoche for pan-Indian culture. And Dr. Cunningham seasons her prose as skillfully as any chef, even to the point of including some artful recipes as illustrations of her basically scholarly narrative."
1,not as the picture,I'm disappointed because I ordered this expresso maker for its design and I received the traditional one. Why Amazon puts a picture and send you a different product?
1,the search for cosmic consciousness,"Very poor book, with quotes from other people,in it last 30 pages is a promotion material by Ormond & Shelly.This one (book) was a total miss by Ormond Mc Gill."
2,"Great idea, but ...","From the other reviews it seems like this is a book you either rave about or can't stand. Despite really wanting to like this book because the plot sounded so interesting, I belong to the latter group. I just couldn't get past the first four or five chapters. The writing seemed stilted and amateurish to me and the female protagonist was so wimpy. Her brother is brought home seriously injured/comatose after a duel and she doesn't get medical aid because she's threatened with scandal? And she's ready to marry a man she just met, again because of the threat of scandal? This really strains the limits of suspension of disbelief. It's unfortuante this book didn't have a good editor to help bring this story to life."
2,Spirited Away,"The idea was wonderful - the execution appalling! I tried to write to Kensington-Zebra books to find out if the editor of this book was still employed. They should not be. If you are an avid reader, if you are irritated by historical inaccuracies, do NOT buy this book. If you are capable of the 'willing suspension of disbelief' go ahead. The idea of a charmed amulet, a woman descended from fairies, a man brought back from the dead, the fight between good and evil - there is a lot going on here ... I can't do it... I can't trash some authors first attempt - but the editor who allowed this book to go to press like this doesn't deserve the title."
3,Not fantastic,"While very professionally done and not bad for a children's CD, (as they usually stink) this CD contains the slowest, most plodding rendition of ""Shake a Tail Feather"" I've ever heard. If you're wanting a heart-pumpin' dance CD, this is definitely not the one. If you're a slow dancer without much pep, then go for it."
1,Shakin a tailfeather,"I absolutely hated this CD. I found it to be grating and irritating. I have played it once and have never played it again. I adore Taj Mahal, was raised on folk music like Pete Seegar and Woody Guthrie, but I am NOT a fan of the gospel music sound. That is what I would call this album. I heard very little Taj Mahal on it, also, which is bothersome. Get Shake Shugaree. It's awesome."
3,"THE ""NAME GAME"" BELONGS IN THE TOILET","Ever since I was 3, I have had a constitutional aversion for that idiotic ""Name Game"" by Shirley Ellis. It is highly irritating, makes absolutely no sense and is darned annoying to boot. It has no saving grace, nothing to recommend it and makes jackhammers sound soothing by comparison.I would have given this 4 or maybe even 5 stars, but including the idiotic ""Name Game"" cost this CD. Everything else on this CD is great, especially ""Follow the Drinking Gourd."" That is a good history lesson about slavery and about using a sky map. An excellent exercise for children (and adults) is to find the Northern Star and identify other constellations. This is a great teaching tool.Leave off the vile ""Name Game"" and you've got a good collection here."
5,This guy eats Guthrie's lunch for him,"Am I happy and/or sad? These are the questions that art, for lack of a better word, sometimes pushes me to ask, and I am all the richer for the ride. This virtuoso Crofton has really done something here with the catchy acoustic songs that have you laughing while you're peering into your lager knowing there's something better. Almost captures the magic of his live show."
4,Shake up your workday!,"Osiyo! Tired of that same old, new age ""pow-wow the indian boy"" type of native american flute music - what I call ""Indian Light""? Tribal Fires is Electric with the power of contemporary Native American artists from many traditions, and moves you from one energizing piece to another. You can feel the air move through your eagle feathers as you soar through mountain passes with the heartbeat of the Mother's drum in your ears, only to find yourself stirring the smog between skyscrapers where taxi horns intermingle with ancient chants. Music which honors our ancestors, our nation and our power... this recording will have you bouncing in front of your computer, even late into the afternoon!"
5,Please...,"Hello!I'm sorry but I don't speak English well.I'm hurry.So as fast as send this book to me, Please.Thank you!"
5,Everyone should have this book!,"No lab should be without a copy of this book! It has everything from lasers, to optical mounts, sand casting, screws, glass work, etc..."
4,"Great Hardware, Decent Software","The actual unit itself is really really great, but the included SageTV Lite software is not very stable. Seemingly at random, it will just stop recording right in the middle of a show, usually after I've had it running for a day or so. I highly recommend this product, but the Java-based software should be restarted daily if you want to have reliable recording."
3,Does not cover pressed flower drying,"Some readers may find it helpful to know that this book covers only silica-type drying methods where the flowers are retained intact and dimensional, it does NOT cover pressed flower drying at all."
2,Recommend Cat Owner's Home Veterinary Handbook instead.,No where near as thorough as Cat Owner's Home Veterinary Handbook. The information was nothing new. Not worth the $18.00 I paid for it.
3,Not The Best...,"The Best Home-Vet Cat Book Ever isCat Owner's Home Veterinary Handbook, Fully Revised and Updatedand this is the new updated version.Really this andStarting from Scratch: How to Correct Behavior Problems in Your Adult Catbehavior book would be the best to have if you could only have two books about your cats.Beleive me, I have tons of books and loads of cat books. I have the highly touted 'Your Cat' Hodgkins DVM it deals primarily with feline diet and is a great book in that regard but for overall, thorough, easily interpreted cat health & behavioral information I would highly, highly recommend the two books listed above.I consider that I know my way around a cat pretty darn good but theStarting from Scratch: How to Correct Behavior Problems in Your Adult Catbook has been a real help with a peeingproblem.Both above-listed books are wonderful. I have had the Cat Owner's Veterinary Handbook for years and just got the updated version linked above.It's the best cat health book available."
3,Touching on Autism,"This DVD was a disappointed in several ways: (1) The sound quality wasn't what it should have been given the price of the DVD. I could barely hear the interviewer who seemed to be off screen at a distance when questioning Kelly, the autistic ABA therapist; (2) I expected more focus on Kelly's work with other children beside's the interviewer's son; (3) I thought that she would be should in varied settings with different children/families; (4) The overall production had a home-made feel to it, though it was good that commentary was provided by a pediatrician who briefly spoke about introducing the GFCF diet to his son. Also, Kelly's mother's comments added another human element. The DVD jacket design is fine and it was one of the reasons why I bought it. Still, I felt elements were missing that would have made it a first-rate production. I wouldn't recommend this video to anyone expecting something more than a second-rate interview overall."
2,not about therapy,I had expected the interview would explore how the therapist worked with children labelled autistic and what she thought was most helpful in what she does. Perhaps she will make another dvd going in to detail about children she has worked with. The interview focussed a good deal on dietary issues. I would have been very interested in specifics of what the therapist does in sessions with individual children.
5,The Legacy of Mel Brooks,"I must reveal up front that I can't be objective when it comes to Mel Brooks. I've been a fan for years ever since the first time I saw ""The 2000 Year Old Man"" on television. Then of course, there was ""Blazing Saddles"", which really hooked me.""The 2000 Year Old Man Man in the Year 2000"" was more of the same silly, clever, ad lib, nonsense Yiddish patter that Brooks and Carl Reiner do so well. In fact, Reiner seems to have as much fun participating in interviews as the audience does listening and watching.The album is pure Brooks/Reiner and if they made six more albums before they die, I'd buy them all. And I'm not even Jewish."
3,These Guys Are Still Funny,This album is a useful part of anyone's repertoire if you just want a good laugh provided by two old pros in the comedy business. There's nothing complicated; just good fun.
2,Bad language,My husband asked for the 2000 Year Old Man CD. Unfortunately I did not realize I was ordering the updated version and apparently they decided that they had to make it x-rated for this century.Parents be forewarned that this is definately nothing you want to listen to in the car with the kids.....It's mostly towards the end but comes up totally unexpected.
1,"a tiresome, snarky pastiche","I don't understand how this qualifies as a book. It seems more like the web-based ramblings of an overindulged young adult who doesn't realize one can no longer be precocious in adulthood, only insufferable.This ""book"" is a tedious read that strings together every '70s and '80s cheesy pop culture reference under the sun and multiple fulminations of snarkiness with the thinnest thread of what might generously be called a plot. This might be Douglas Coupland without the humanity and talent, or Hunter S. Thompson without the genuine gonzo insanity. Or, what (again) a precocious child might produce if he read both and understood neither.If there's one good thing, this piffle lacks the intellectual heft to spawn the avalanche of post-modernist deconstruction that afflicted David Foster Wallace, for example.A note to all pretentious young writers: living in a down-at-the-heels, off campus apartment during your college years doesn't confer bohemianism."
2,A Xerox(tm),"This book was much, much better the first time I read it, when it was titled ""Choke."" Or when it was ""Microserfs.""Actually, that's not fair. A knock off of one of those would have a lead character who changed over the course of the novel. Beemer Minutia is a jerk on page 1, and he's a jerk on the last page. Someone should hit him in the face with a shovel. Or, as Gaslin would write it, in the face with an xBox(tm) or a can of Mountain Dew(tm) or something else with a ""tm"" at the end of it. This isn't really violence, since Beemer isn't really a person -- just a one-dimensional idea. He's the kind of person a shallow person thinks he is. Beemer thinks he's special because his desperation is loud and narcissistic. Would that he were right."
2,They pass the savings and assembly hell on to you,"So I have been a member of amazon for 8 years and have never been driven to write a review until now... Yes the price is right but when your instruction manual references part number 278,,, yes 278... You know you're in for trouble. Plus the manual reads like an aircraft repair guide... Argh! But anyway, I agree with the other reviews about construction quality... Fair at best,,, particle board covered with a coat of lacquer... Not strong and not durable,,, but it looks nice and for the price what do you expect. I just didn't expect to have to assemble every piece of drawer hardware, 2.5 hours for me and then have to put in all the sliders and then finally the actual unit,,, 4 hours easy... If south shore would just send it partially assembled then assembly would have been much easier... Good luck,,,Just have a six pack handy and a free afternoon... you'll need all of it..."
1,Horrible Experience...,...and I am not even talking about the actual product! Twice I had to return the dresser because of long board being cracked the first time and completely snapped in two the second time. Unacceptable.
3,Would of helped if directions were included,Not a bad dresser once its assembled but the box that the dresser came in did not include assembly instructions. I attempted to call the manufacturer but they were already closed. Im glad I have a smart friend because he was able to put it together that night and I didnt have to wait til the next day.
2,Completely crumbled after a few months...,This is a beautiful dresser that was relatively easy to assemble. It warped after a few months causing the drawers to either fall through or get stuck. After a few more months it is a pile of rumble with my clothes trapped inside! You get what you pay for I suppose.
3,It's alright...,"I ordered this product for my new bedroom, along with pretty much the rest of the bedroom set. It looks great now that its finished, however it took me easily 2 hours to build this with power tools working fast. Very difficult to build. ALSO a about 1 hour into the build i discovered a board was cracked almost in half. I didnt want to deal with returning it so i just used the piece as is. lucky this piece was not visible from the outside so it looks good. Overall its a risky buy with a lot of complaints about broken pieces but if you get lucky its a great looking end product."
1,Most difficult furniture I have ever assembled!,Without a doubt the most difficult piece of furniture I have ever assembled!! Took hours...would not do it again. Back to IKEA for me!
1,WORST DRESSER EVER!,"The parts to this dresser were barely labelled, and came with HORRIBLE instructions. Each step was a picture and MAYBE a sentence that doesn't really tell you how to put it together. This dresser was worse than Ikea! It took me 3 weekends to put it together (even though I am pretty good at putting stuff together) and once I was finished the drawers didn't even line up! one drawer is so tight it hardly even pulls out! There was a step where I had to screw through plastic, and had to call the help line to see if I was doing it right. Nothing about this product is quality. I would advise that NO ONE buys this product. ITS A TERRIBLE PRODUCT THAT WAS A DISASTER TO PUT TOGETHER!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Great but not so great....,"Finished product is great, but it came all beat up, taped together, the base board was a completely different color wood than the rest it also had scratches and places where the laminate folding over.... We kept it because it wasn't visible to anyone and only we know it is there, but still bad quality control on the manufacturer's part."
4,Looks Beautiful!!,"I gave this dresser 4 stars, but I would have given it 5 stars if it didn't take so long to recieve and if it was packaged a little better because there were a little bit of chips on the dresser, but not too noticeable. The dresser is beautiful, it looks classy and it was really easy to put together. I liked it so much I'm buying another one."
1,Traci,"I also received this item damaged. I sent it back and had target send me another. However, the item was not available for them to resend to me. I just checked online and the two dressers and the headboard are now not available. I am glad now that the dresser was damaged because I couldn't have finished the collection anytime soon anyways."
1,Junk,I received this dresser and it was very damaged! The first thing I pulled out of the box had a broken corner and it just got worse after that. A drawer front had a big chip right on the front and the piece for the base was broken in half. It was not too surprising considering that there were no packaging materials used to protect it. I am all set with ordering furniture or any other large item from target.com again.
4,"lot of work to assemble, some flaws","- bought platform bed, this dresser, headboard and side table- some damage on top plank during trip from east coast to west coast, but not too bad- if you think the south shore platform bed is hard to assemble, you must try this dresser :-) (not very hard, but takes several hours)- all slides are low friction plastic (no rollers). These are press fit into the drawer sides, it takes a LOT of effort to hammer 24 pieces into the wood- the slides have to be more or less perfectly assembled for the drawers to slide properly in my view, the drawers slide fine, but only just (I added some teflon dry film lubricant, but it did not make a huge difference, the friction exists due to tight fit)- overall, looks good, instructions are decent, but assembly is somewhat complex (a mechanically minded DIY person saying this)- will deduct one star for slight damage and the ridiculous work of hammering 24 plastics drawer slide pieces"
4,Very nice for the price,"It's a very nice dresser, especially for the price. It took about 3 hours with two of us putting it together. It's a solid piece that will definitely hold up for years. We've even purchased the 5 drawer dresser since this purchase."
2,Disappointed,"Although I read bad reviews about this dresser, I ordered anyway because the picture was so nice. I'm slightly happy with my purchase because the price is inexpensive. However, all of the drawers are slanted. I followed the assembly instructions exactly, and it looks sloppy. Also, there were many chips and bent corners, as though the board had been dropped. If I had known it would look like this, I would have spent a little more for a better dresser. I also bought two matching bed stands and the drawers slant in the same direction."
3,good for the price,"Just bought this item (from wal-mart online, free site-to-store-shipping was a plus) and i'm disappointed because the castors that slide the drawers out are plastic! The one on the drawers under the platform bed i had just bought from the same collection were really nice metal ones. And the bottoms of the drawers are some cardboard laminate. But for the price, I think it will work for now....and it looks nicer than it actually is, from a distance (drawers handles are metal). But, I still haven't even finished putting it together, so we'll see. Maybe I should have bought a pre-assembled nice all-wood piece from a furniture store???"
1,Very cheaply made!,"The dresser itself is very cheaply made, it feels pretty flimsy once it's together. The drawers don't line up and it wasn't due the assembly because both rows of drawers are off equally. They also left out he back of the dresser so we have to wait for a replacement. The instructions are organized so that it takes you an hour longer than it should to assemble. You can definitly get better for your money."
2,Poor Craftsmanship,"Everything looked great when pulled from box but when I started to assemble the material, some holes were not big enough for the plugs. Had to use my own drill to fix. Also some screws would not go all the way through the wood. Need better materials."
2,Imagine the exorcist....but scarier,"well thats what your in for if you buy any of south shore furniture. It will take atleast 2 1/2 hours to assemble if you work non stop, and some pieaces dont fit into it either. I still cant fit the drawers in... Please take my advice and buy from someone who you know will satisfy you, Because I wish someone warned me before I bought this furniture!"
4,First dresser,"The box was heavy and I had to bring it into the room piece by piece. Pain in the butt to put together and I usually like putting things together. However it was easy to lift upright by myself after assembling the main part and I very weak tiny little arms.It was kind of a pain having to hammer all of the plastic sliding things in place. It took me a long time.When I put the drawers in a couple of them didn't line up correctly. Although, they are all labeled as being the same there are left and right drawers. I was able to switch them out and now it looks great. No problem with it holding anything. One of them is stuffed with sweaters now.Nice looking and great for the price. Now my room is all pretty. I just had plastic tubs for sleep stuff, sweaters, and things before. I've very proud of it."
1,worst made crap i ever bought,"made of cheep press board but still not bad for the price just make sure you never move it without first taking it apart, as press board simply wont hold a screw or nail if under the stress of moving. and never let it get wet it will simply disintegrate.also ups never waited for a signature just left out in the foyer and in the city that is asking for it to be stolen good thing it ways 111 lbs. good luck with this one"
3,"Good price and looks good, BUT","Has good appearance, but not very high quality although I didn't expect too much based on price. Assembly is a nightmare, especially when some of the bolts are defective and they don't provide extras"
1,South Shore 6 drawer triple dresser,"First of all, the product received was the wrong color. Secondly, this product is horrible. Very tedious to assemble together. Took about 4 people to try to put together. Directions given was sheer agony trying to read and interpret. Not a good product. Very disappointed. Ready for the trash heap. Don't spend money on this cheap product."
2,Low Quality Dresser,I have had this dresser less than a year I bought this dresser becuase I have the small night stands they seemed to hold up ok because of this I wanted to get the matching dresser thinking that it would be the same. That is not the case the furniture is very flimsy and can not hold very much. I regret buying this item but you get what you pay for now not only did I spend the money to buy this dresser now due to it falling apart and the drawers are coming apart now I have to spend money to get a new one. I do not normally write reviews but I would seriously think twice before buying this dresser It is not worth the price you have to pay.
2,Came with many pieces,It came in about 50 pieces was really very difficult to put together. But once put together it was nice for the price.
1,Piece of Crap,"I would rate this zero stars it doesn't even deserve a star. This is the most cheaply made piece of crap I've ever purchased. The pieces don't even fit together and the screws don't fit the boards. It took me over two days to put this thing together because nothing fit and everything kept falling apart. I put it together two weeks ago and because the drawers would not stay together I had to get my own nails and nail some of them into the boards. But just today, I opened a drawer just to have the piece of crap fall apart on me!!! The directions were a little backwards too. Some of them said to put a few pieces in before putting screws in but then the screws wouldn't go in after the other pieces were in. What the heck?! The holes that were already made into the boards were too big for the screws and other pieces to even stay in there. They just kept falling out. I will never buy from this company again!!!!"
3,Holly Cow,"This was the toughest thing to put together. Two handy people and it took forever. Not all the pieces came in good shape. Some of the screws were missing the screw indentations and not all the holes were pre made. Def need some elbow grease and half a day to put this together. In the end the dresser did look good and pretty sturdy for the price. This is not a piece that will last long but again, for the price and what we need it for, it will do."
1,worst furniture I have ever buy,"This is the worst furniture I have buy, it came with the hardware incomplete, we went back to the store and they opened a new box and gave us the hardware which was also incomplete, we went back again and they opened another box and gave us the hardware again...one more time it was incomplete.We called the supplier and they said they were going to send the parts within 2 weeks, 3 weeks have passed already and nothing. We called the supplier again and all we get is an answering machine."
1,bad quality,this is product has a short Cracks in the medal of the dresser. and it was taking over the average time to mailed to me.
5,FIT Happens at any age!,"Dad: This is really cool! My friends and I at school Googled Dream BIG! and Fit Happens came up. The book ROCKS, and I'm proud of you. Joey."
5,"Attitude, The Core of Living!","Mike Pierron has totally exemplified the true meaning of developing a positive attitude, in order to live life day in and day out! This book totally blew my mind in regards to a different style of weight training methods in order to develope yourself both metally and physically.He not only encompasses the how and why you should get into the best possible shape at any age, but more importantly how to become a better person in life!I am totally sold and excited regarding what Mike has to offer in this book and I have already started to train and live differently, in order to build a winning attitude!Thanks Mike, can't wait for your next book!"
2,"Tech Info 8, Useful SDK 1","The technical information on 3D provided in the book is good, it's as decent a text as many others out there (not in the top 3 but in the top 20). HOWEVER... the SDK documentation is lacking and some basic information on using the 3DS MAX plugins, etc. is completely missing. With a lot of experimentation I managed to export levels, but such basics as how to create doors, platforms, etc. are not in either the book, the tutorial, or the Web site. Bottom line: if you want tech info on game programming with OpenGL, this is an OK book. If you want to play around with the SDK, you're better off downloading CrystalSpace from SourceForge - it's better documented!"
2,Hardly worth my time,"The book is ok if all you want to learn is theory. If you really want something that shows you the ins-and-outs of realtime 3d processing, this book isn't for you. I felt like there were too many topics covered and the important ones were skimmed over. There is a total lack of practical example code as well - don't bother looking at the FlySDK either - it's a waste of time.The final straw was when I had to learn BSP techniques. This book had maybe 10 pages on the topic, no real code, only a sample formula that made no sense. I did some research on the Internet and found supporting information and better formulas (for free, mind you) that helped me to understand and formulate my own BSP algorithm. I went back and looked at the section in the text again and found how much was really left out of the BSP section and it was shameful."
1,"Bugs, Errors, Typos, broken code... doh!","Although the book itself is very promising and states the basic concepts of a 3D grphics library, I still don't recommend this book at all. Why? Because if you buy a book that is built onto a SDK, you also want to USE the SDK (otherwise you buy another book that just tells you about the concepts). If now the authors provide you with tutorials and utilities to convert - let's say - 3D Studio MAX - files into their own level-filetypes things seem to be ok. But if you finally realize that the provided utilities are not working, the MAX-export-plugins have to be (a) installed in a different way they tell you and (b) still cause MAX to crash when you do not work with a simple box (how interesting!), you get really mad. After trying around for several hours I gave up and had a nice christmas-campfire.In the past months a lot of VERY good books were released on this topic, you are better off with one of these."
3,Okay,"This book is older that I anticipated, but it is packed with information and knowledge if you want to start at the bottom. It was a little too technical for me. But if you are a computer geek/nerd, it's probably right up your alley."
4,Good Book For Real-Time Rendering Concepts,"This may not be my favorite book, but I do seem to keep picking it up time after time. If you are trying to get a handle on the concepts that are used in current 3D games, this book may prove to be very helpful. I was not very impressed by the Fly3D SDK, but this could be because the demo levels were not really great examples of what the engine could do. It does appear to have many advanced features though."
2,a very slow read,"i really enjoyed the last book in this series, explaining Sebastian and Helena's story. but this book i found hard to get into and the character's difficult to relate to. i like Portia and the dowager... i would have liked Simon better if he was portrayed better, but to my disappointment, he wasn't. Simon is a confident, strong character, but Stephanie Lauren's portrayal of him, didn't show that. sadly, i returned this book the day after i got it."
2,disappointed,I waited for this book and was excited about getting it.I was really disappointed. The story was very thin.It was almost the Tannebaum movie in print form.If you saw the movie... I don't think that type of storycan or should be put in print.
2,"A ""Perfect Bore""","I found this latest installment of the Cynster series to be dreadfully lacking. Where is the sexual tension and buildup? There is none. The subplot (murder) was equally lacking in tension. Indeed, I could not bring myself to really connect or care about any of the charactors."
1,"Finally, an end to the Cynsters!","I had one MAJOR problem with this book -- Simon and Portia have pages of discussion with themselves about what they are feeling and should they/will they connect with each other -- who cares!There's these 3 page long monologes with each one thinking about if it's gonna work, should they, could they, blah-blah-blah. I would get into the story and then, BAM, another long monolog ...frankly, they just needed to shut up.I was also recommended ALL FOR LOVE...Lucifier's story. I just never got into it. If I hadn't paid $6 for it, I wouldn't have bother'd finishing it."
1,Have fun plodding through....,"This was a very boring read with too much internal dialogue and introspection for what the situation was.He wanted a wife, and she wanted to have babies and also learn about sex. And they were at a house party. Ho hum.I did not think the sex scenes steamy in any way.Anyway, just my 2 cents."
2,Rated X,"Stephanie Laurens' newest Cynster book ""The Perfect Lover"" has nothing ""perfect"" about it. While I've enjoyed her previous novels (especially Devil's Bride and A Rake's Vow), this one leaves a lot to de desired. The story is about the ""last unmarried male Cynster of his generation"" Simon, who suddenly realizes that he is getting older and hasn't achieved anything in life. He decides to find a wife, and fill his recently inherited estate with children. Enter Portia Ashford, his brother in law's Luc sister, who ""surprise surprise"" has decided she wants children too. What follows are a large number of very explicit sex scenes, a semi mystery, more sex, endless pages describing the characters thoughts, more sex, and so on...If you want to read about sex, sex and more sex, this is for you, but if you are looking for a love story skip this one. There was no romance whatsoever, all Portia and Simon did was enjoy eachother's bodies, quite thoroughly."
1,bad house party,"I love Ms. laurens novels especially those involving the Cynsters. This was just not in the same class as her other books. There were no visits from any of the other Cynsters even though one of their own was in danger, which is totally unbelievable. There was a murder and I really didn't care who did it. There was sex with no romance or even dialogue between the main characters. If Simon commented one more time how glad he was she did not engage in useless chatter I was going to scream. Honestly I don't know why I finished it except maybe I thought I would get a Cynster update in the end, even for diehard fans this book is not worth reading."
1,Boring,"I have read a lot of books by Stephanie Laurens, where the character are well thought out and appealing. This book lacked feeling. I felt nothing for the characters, no compassion, no sparks. Just ink on a page. The characters seemed to just be at a party, and they both decided that it was time to look for a marriage partner, and since they knew each other, (even though they didn't like each other) then why not I. The B story was lacking also, the characters had no depth and you did not care what happen to them. Don't waist your money."
1,Disappointed!!!!!,"I was impressed with the first books in this series, but this one is very disappointing. The story was very difficult to follow. I would not recommend this book."
2,Not up to snuff,"I'm usually a huge Stephanie Laurens fan and a fan of the Cynster series. This book however is really lacking her usually style and humour. You know in the first 10 pages how it's going to turn out --- there's a semi-interesting mystery (ala Amanda Quick) thrown in the middle, but that's the only interesting piece in the book at all. I almost stopped reading it 1/4 of the way through because it was just boring and completely predictable (in an overdone, not comfort food) kind of way. Here's hoping her next book is better..."
2,Disappointing,"Inasmuch as I dearly loved all the other Cynster books, I found this one lacking. I truly had to force myself to finish this book. There was no spark at all to keep me entranced. I missed the family interaction that was in the other books. Simon may be a Cynster in name only because he sure doesn't act like one. Was he adopted??? Portia is an intelligent woman whose priorities are skewed. I think this series is done...time to move on."
1,The Perfect Bore,"I have all of the Bar Cynster books. I was excited when I saw this on the newsstand, but very disappointed in the book itself. I would compare this book to a pornographic movie that has no plot just mindless, boring sex. There was no romance here, just graphic repeated sex. Not even real love demonstrated. The plot was good but it was constantly upstaged by the sex that seems a little farfetched to believe that Portia's reputation was not ruined by her behavior. I lost all respect for both Portia and Simon."
3,No Story-Just lots of XXX,"I've never been so bored as I was during the reading of this book. The only reason I finished it was because I can't stand to start a book and not read it in its entirety.If pornography were all I wanted, this would certainly fill that need. But, this is not the book for someone wanting to read a warm love story with a meaningful plot.."
3,NOT HER BEST,"I was eagerly awaiting this book. After the first six pages, I had to push myself to continue reading through the poor editing -- from what dictionary did ""forseen"" come? Yet, out of devotion to Stephanie Laurens and to the Cynsters, I read on...to disappointment. Although Simon and Portia may have felt comfortable in each other's silence, this reader would have liked more conversation, more passion, less introspection, and fewer rambing narratives. Simon and Portia never seemed to connect on any level. Read this book because you want to complete the series but don't expect to be ""thrilled"" as you were in the other books."
5,Excellent Romance/Murder Mystery,"Portia Ashford is visiting the Glossops at Glossop Hall with family friend Lady Obaldstone. The Cynster of this story, Simon, is there also. Amidst the usual Laurens style romance, the host's daughter in law, the loose Kitty is found strangled. Apparently the murderer has Portia in mind as the next victim.Stephanie Laurens as usual writes a story that is hard to put down. This is an easy series to get addicted to. Too bad she doesn't write faster, but noone could write fast enough. The characters are quirky and entertaining and the mystery in this one was better than usual. Good read."
5,* * * *A KEEPER* * * *,THIS IS A BOOK THAT I AIM TO KEEP...I HAVE STARTED TRYING TO BE MORE DISCRIMINANT ON BOOKS THAT I WILL KEEP BUT THIS IS ONE I WILL. HAVE SEARCHED FOR AND READ ALL OF HER BOOKS BASED ON THIS ONE AND WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED. THIS WAS THE BEST THOUGH.WOULD BE WORTH READING.
5,Wonderful Ethiopians--An excellent pioneering work,"Wonderful Ethiopians of the Ancient Cushite Empire represents the crowning achievement of Ms. Drusilla Dunjee Houston. The work was originally published in Oklahoma City in 1926. It is the first known attempt by a Black woman, and perhaps anyone, to produce a multi-volume work on African history told from an African perspective.Ms. Houston herself was an educator, journalist and historian. She spent most of her life in Oklahoma and Arizona and succumbed to tuberculosis in Phoenix, Arizona in 1941.Her work is broad and comprehensive and was quite advanced for its time. Its audience was not confined to scholars but the layperson, particularly Black folk, who were in need of a accurate tonic to boost Black self-esteem. It retains a powerful value even today, more than seventy years since its initial publication."
5,Insightful,She wrote this book before DNA It is like she lived there. I was able to pick out key things to study my anscestry.
3,Important Work,"One thing is inaccurate though. The Cushites (ancient Ethiopians) actually predate Kemet(ancient Egypt). Kemet and even Mesopotamia (Sumer) began as Cushite colonies. They received their culture and knowledge from their parent civilization which predates them both by thousands of years. See Cheikh Anta Diop, et al."
4,complete mini?,"Excellent book for the reader interested in a complete listing of mini production. It details all the changes in specifications throughout the production life of the mini automobile with excellent and complete black and white photos. What is missing is color pictures and any mention of the ""new"" mini."
1,Too hard for daughter to use,"I bought these as a gift for my teenage daughter. The clips are very difficult for her to open and put in her ears; therefore, she has never worn them."
3,"Some good, some bad","I wish publishers would stop saying Anne Rice is the 'queen of vampire literature'. She is not an author I care to read. Also, I'm not crazy about Tanith Lee. I always feel like I've missed the point of her stories. Halfway through this book I had to struggle to finish the stories. The first half of the book (other than the Anne Rice story) was fine, then the stories got weird/uncomfortable. That being said, if you like the vampire myth, there are a lot of good/great stories in this book. My favorite is Jack by Connie Willis. Oh, and how come Laurel K Hamilton didn't have a story in this collection?"
1,NOPE.,"In fairness and honesty, I didnt read any of the stories from beginning to end. I read the first few pages. I dont soldier through boring stories hoping for excitement down the road. Most editors do the same; if things dont snap, crackle, or pop close to page one...it's not likely to happen later."
3,My spoiled dog didn't like this,But my sons dogs love it. My dog is very picky and spoiled so it doesn't surprise me. Can't blame the product.
3,Piratical Casca!,"Although Casca novels are rich with detail and historical adventure, this one could have been much better than it was. This started the decline of the series. Was Barry running out of steam?Though not Sadler's worst casca book, definately not close to being his best."
4,Just what I needed!,"Well i will start off with the bad, These are shorter than the stock or at least they don't line up with factory screw holes. No biggie just drill some MORE holes in your Jeep. They have been very useful, needed them to do a color change and that's what they did."
3,"Some tracks excellent, others lacking","Preferring the Brazilian beats with more energy, I fell in love with only a few of the tracks on this CD. Some of the songs, I absolutely love, unfortunately, the majority are too slow and sappy for me. I love 'o gene' and 'o olho do lado'. 'Xiquexique' is bizarre and cool and other than that, the rest of the CD I could do without save the two remixes at the end."
5,A helpful tool in researching one's ancestry.,This book has been a handy reference source in identifying what types of records are available for genealogical research in Ireland. Some guides to records by county.
4,Great Jerky,"Pemmican jerky is some of my favorite jerky (outside of the nuggets from Jack Links), although the peppered variety isn't the best I've had from them. I prefer the mesquite or the original.The jerky is nice and chewy like I like it, but yet not hard as a rock. Amazon in the past has sent me stuff close to expiration, but these had at least a year before it expired. The 1.8oz packs are great also because it's about the perfect amount for a snack."
3,Front Loader,It's a Front Loader and looks like it's driving backwards. Even our 21 month old thinks it should drive with the dump in back.
2,WHERE'S THE REAL MOURNING REIGN?,"Great compilation, however where is the credit for the Mourning Reign's greatest keyboard and rhythm guitar player Jay Garrett. Come on give credit where credit is due!"
1,Old version 3.2 and audio dead when upgraded to 3.54,"Like the aboce review, it came with old version 3.20. When I upgraded to 3.54, the audio went dead. Tried to upgrade to 4.0 but then 99 dollar fee for it. Do not buy this refurbished one, one would be much better off byung a new one..."
5,Still ticking and plotting,"Have had the unit for awhile and it is still ""ticking"". Slow starting-very slow, but then it does a good job of getting you there and back. Has even given us some pretty neat ""short cuts"". Will drive you nuts with the ""Make a U turn when legal"" (or like verbage) if you deviate from its' planned route. What ever, we use it with confidence on every trip. Good pricing and delivery from Amazon."
3,"map updates, sound, battery and repeat","hello,i wantto talk about 4 different points.1. be ready to pay more on updating maps which are already at least 1 year old.2. you might experience hardware problem like loosing sound. i can get the sound by doing configuration/diagnostic/audio test. if i try to change the sound level, i loose it all.3. i wish it has internal battery so i can carry it around.4. repeat the last comment is somethign you should have in any kind of gps. it is great if you miss something or if you did not understant what was told."
4,big boys toys,"i had a problem with thi when i first got it, i called megellan and they took care of it buy sending me a new one, amazonn also told me that if megellan did not replace it they would take care of it. you can not ask for more than that."
2,I agree: Don't buy the remanufactured unit!,"I was very excited about this unit and hoped that the ""re-manufacturer"" is doing a better job refurbishing these units after some of the posts on this page. Unfortunately, the unit I received didn't even power up from any of the included power adapters."
5,Well pleased,"As advertised and as expected. Good delivery. This unit is just like my 760 model- I can't tell the difference except that the 700 cost much less. Operation is easy and reliable. This unit comes with a windshield mount which is rather long and wobbly. There are others on the market, such as dash tripod mount - good but bulky- and a light A/C vent mount that does quite well even though not made for beating on. I use the A/C vent mount now and am pleased with it ($8.00).This 700 model comes with European maps preinstalled ( you of course need to buy an unlock ""key"" from Magellan for about $225)."
2,Ships with older version of software (3.20).,Ships with version 3.2 software -- you face an immediate $99 upgrade charge to get to the current version 4.20.
1,Bad service support for Magellan RoadMate,"Do not trust Magellan Customer support, they do not have data access and do not care about Magellan reputation.I used Magellan RoadMate 700 for one day before smoke came out of the unit and it stopped working. Factory no longer has RoadMate 700 in stock for replacements, and technician promised me a new cradle within 5 days. I called after a week, 1st rep. said unit was not shipped and will be shipped immediately, I called 2nd time and another rep. said that unit was shipped 3 days ago and gave me a tracking number not for my package, I called 3rd time and another rep. said that they do not have part, that they will have it in a week and that it will take them another week to ship it to me.After 7 days of being a proud owner of Magellan 700 I shipped it back to the company that I bought it from and expecting a replacement for the entire unit now."
1,Only 2.5 yrs old and doesn't work!!!,"We bought this GPS unit back in 2004 for cross country. It was great then. Then we did a software upgrade last year (2006) ,and this year the unit is basically non-functional now. The unit freezes upon processing data/destination route. This is really disappointing for a company that sells the unit (originally new for over $1K). We expected to get more life out of this unit. Additionally, we inquired about the unit repair--we would have to fork over another $200 to get the unit fixed after last year's upgrade, which cost us about $200 then--to find out the warranty for the upgrade is only for 3 months. What kind of warranty is that? What company would have so low confidence in their product to only offer a 3 month warranty? $200 is no small amount. Recommend buying a GARMIN. Magellan people have a lot of problems to fix!"
3,Magellan 700,"Sorry to disappoint you but, I am still have difficulty receiving the cradle from the Magellan company. I have been trying since Dec. 26th to receive the cradle to no available. I will be calling them again today, and will want to speak to the President regarding this issue. I will continue to be in contact with your company as I may still want to return this unit to your company, since we are unable to make any progress with the Magellan company.Thank you for your interest.Alice Frates"
5,Gran disco,"Este álbum es realmente bueno, el producto llego en perfectas condiciones y la presentación es realmente de lujo, muy bueno."
5,As advertised,"incredible historic document. Incredible playing, songs and chemistry. A great record for ALL rock and blues fans. Buy this soon."
5,I Have Some of Their Vinyls,"Yeah! I have some of their vinyls. I have the very first Bluesbreakers lp called John Mayall Plays John Mayall, and A Hard Road as imports. Bluesbreakers with Eric Clapton as a domestic. I have a few Mayall singles that are domestic releases.But, this to me is the John Mayall Epoch. I remember going into a record store on Chestnut Street in Philadelphia and going through all these import record lp's. I had already owned the lp Fresh Cream and then I saw Bluebreakers with Eric Clapton. Not realizing this lp was released, I thought to myself ""What Happened?"" ""Cream split, already""? Then I was told that these sessions were finished before Cream was formed. Anyway, a great musical treasure of great blues music. From start to finish, it is the absolute bomb."
5,Dottie D.,"I really enjoyed watching ""Little Girl Lost"" because there is some footage about Dorothy Dandridge that i had never seen before. The title of the Biography is a stretch, because it never seemed like she was lost. To me, it seemed as if she was ""searching"" for something other than existing,both in her professional and personal life. Nonetheless, this is a jewel of a biography and if you are in AWE about this beautiful Jewel, Dorothy Dandridge as I am, it is a must have for your collection! Buy It! One other thing, I am hopeful and optimistic that there will be new and different CD's and DVD's about Dottie, like some of her live shows or other archival footage that is laying around in some movie studios trunk. After seeing this VHS, you are going to want more! Buy It!"
3,Hit or Miss,"This is one of those hit or miss books. With any repair manual, it is only valuable if it covers the repairs you are trying to perform. My problem with many of the Haines guides is that they are a little too general in nature. Some things in the book were helpful, but others were not covered well enough."
2,Piece of crep,Looks good in the car but the receiver floats in it cause it wont lock. You could never use this for a professional installation.
1,ZERO stars,"Hands down the worst documentary I have ever seen. I thought the story of the legend was interesting so I checked it out. It is obviously scripted and played out by a terrible crew and cast, along with atrocious editing. I can't believe I just wasted minutes of my life watching this. Horrendous. PS. I've never left a review for anything on Amazon so this is my first. That's how angry I am about watching this pathetic excuse of a film."
2,El Tango de Buenos Aires CD,"We purchased this CD primarily to practice our tango dancing, and were disappointed. All the songs have vocals - rather than primarily instrumental numbers - and the rubato and other vocal nuances he throws in make it a hard CD to practice dancing to. For someone primarily interested in a tango CD for listening, it might be fine."
5,A really great show!,"I first saw this show when it previewed at Duke University. I fell in love with the entire production. Everything about the production, music, lyrics, and leading stars belong on Broadway in my opinion. Some producers need to get their hands on this show and revive it with this entire cast."
2,"buy it for because it's an oldie but goodie, not to learn harmonica","Like many, this was the first harmonica book that I owned and bought it because it was the only harmonica instruction available back in 1965 when it was first published. The book is filled with errors which they didn't bother to correct in this 2008 reprint (see patmissin website to see what they are). Also, there were floppy vinyl recordings that came with some editions of the book that aren't included here.There is much better instruction available today--look to Portnoy, Barrett, Gindick and Duncan books if you're serious about learning diatonic harmonica out of a book. YouTube also has some good instruction."
1,seem to be a butchered version of a masterpiece,"According to the product information on Amazon, this DVD lasts 105 minutes. It must be the butchered version of this more than three hour masterpiece. I hope I am wrong, for this is one of my all-time favorite movies. I have seen the shortened version in a theatre; it was sickening to realize how they had cut the heart out of some sequences."
1,Short version only!,"I love this movie, but I hoped to get the original version, which is about 3h long.The information given in the web is: 188 minutes. The truth about the DVD is: only 105 minutes! Very disapointing!!! The online-shop didn't answer any questions about it!!"
5,Great book!,"This book is very easy to read and provides useful information to parents of new college students. I am the author of The ABC's of College Life, a hip street-smart guide for college bound students and I give Letting Go two thumbs up!!"
2,Not that great...Try a different brand!,"This isn't that great... The room has to very dark for it to work very well, and at best the images are pretty indistinct and boring--just colored shapes trying to be pictures. The globe can be easily overwound by toddlers, and the quality of the hardware is just not too impressive. Try the Tomy Starbright Light Show--my kids have both of these and they always ask for the latter. The images are so much better, it may as well be a slide projector that is revolving the adorable teddy bears, clouds, moons and stars on your ceiling."
3,Baby Lullaby Show,"This product works fairly well. I just wished for the price and durability, it worked using an on/off switch with an option to turn the music off. However, it does get the attention of our infant baby girl but the images should be brighter."
3,Lullaby light show,"My husband and I searched everywhere for something that would project images on the ceiling/walls, moved, and played music. We found that in the lullaby light show. It works adequately, however it could be much better if it worked using an on/off switch. It lasts about 4 minutes, which sometimes doesn't seem long enough. You can see the images, however they aren't very bright or distinct. So, it works adequately for what we wanted, however there are many improvements that can be made."
2,Has potential,"This does not plug in. It is battery operated. It only stays on for a few minutes and then you have to wind it again. You cannot have just the light. You have to have the light and sound together. To get the effect shown in the picture, the globe has to be about 2 inches away from the wall. The light does not shine far enough to be seen on the ceiling. It is easy to wind too far and makes a horrible sound when you do so. I haven't broken it yet though."
4,eazy e kicks major buttocks on these,"Man i got these a few days ago and they rock my sack to the extreme! i aint usually down with blasting music but since i got this speaker i been blastin it all over the place and my neybors been gettin real mad because of how loud it is. this speaker is awesome in the most awesome way and it plays music real loud and real real clear. if you want a major awesome speaker then buy this. the only thing is that it's really expensive. i had to use two hole paychecks to get it but i been real happy ever since. my friend told me to get some Eazy E to listen to on the speaker and i been listenin to it all day everyday. it's awesome. you aint lived right till you heard ""Nutz on ya chin"" by eazy e blastinfrom this awesome speaker. the awesomeness can't be described. just try it. i been singing these songs all the time now that i got this awesome speaker. i love it."
4,If only you could add speakers...,"I wish this system could be expanded with the small Bose wireless speakers so I could ""truly"" relpace my home stereo system. The sound is good, but not BIG enough to fill my great room/entire living area with sound. You would think Bose would have thought of this. They could have made a fortune selling more speakers.Ah well....."
5,Great sound!,"The Bose SoundDock is an excellent speaker for iPods. It has great sound and is perfect for listening to music. An iPod paired with this speaker makes a perfect substitute for your stereo system. The unit also charges your iPod. There is a small remote with limited functions that comes with the unit. It can turn the unit on/off and pause, rewind or forward the current playlist.I have really enjoyed using this speaker. The unit is large and is not meant to be portable. It is only portable within a home. I would recommend something smaller for more portability and travel. (This speaker is not compatible with other MP3 players.)"
2,"Good sound, uses alot of electricity when OFF!","This unit produces some very good sound with bass. However I should note that the system uses between 5 to 9 watts of electricity when the system is off! That is, the ipod is off.The bottom of the unit is warm to the touch as is the power brick. It may never power down despite there being an ipod attached to the systema and whether the ipod is off or not. Bad design from an efficiency point of view.SO, it it is a great compact unit that won't disappointed with sound quality. However, be sure to unplug it when not using it!"
3,"Sounds good, poorly designed, bad utility.....","It sounds very good, but....For a few pennies more, they could have added a clock/alarm or input/output jacks. Amazon has a dirt cheap generic player similar to this and even that one has a input jack (and a video out RCA plug, and it even has a USB outlet). Furthermore, the front mount is flimsy, and because the power cord plug points to the back as opposed to the side, it needs an additional 1"" of clearance on a bookshelf.With a standard input jack, it actually would have been a nice space saver because I could have hooked my computer up to it and tossed out my computer speakers. Also, it would have been good for other MP3 players, or even to use instead of the standard TV speaker(s). Additionally, it would be useful for years to come."
3,Know What To Expect!,"You should definitely buy the SoundDock if you want a nice looking system that's easy to set up, easy to use, and delivers decent sound from your iPod. But if you think you might want more than the limitations of an iPod-only system, you're much better off with a ""desktop stereo"" that accepts iPod input. For another $100 (or less), GREAT desktop systems from Yamaha, B&S, and several others are available. It's not really fair to compare the SoundDock to these systems. Compared to other iPod-only setups (including Apple's own iPod HiFi, the Bose strikes a fine balance between strong bass and crisp trebble & mid-range. It's a ""can't go wrong"" product, unless you expect it to be something that it isn't."
3,"great sound, lasted a year and half.",This gizmo is delicate. It lasted about a year and a half. But the sound was good. the Alteclansing inMotion iM7 sounded better and is made to be portable. The iM7 also has it's own problems with delicate parts....
1,"If you have an old, first-generation ipod...","... this product is NOT for you. I bought the Bose Sound Dock to use with my 3 year old ipod and had to return it. Before buying, I did a lot of research, but all I found was that the product was compatible to all ipods, but it's not!"
2,"5 Stars for Product, 0 Stars for Pricing","The Bose SoundDock is a remarkable product that gives great sound from your ipod but I have a problem with how Bose insists on forcing retailers to sell it for the same price. Bose can sell its product for whatever it wants to retailers but they in turn should be allowed to sell it to their customers for whatever price they wish. This policy is decidedly unfriendly to consumers as they are paying higher prices than what would be offered normally in a competitive marketplace. Until Bose decides to change its ways, this consumer won't be buying."
4,Expensive but good sound,"Many of the Ipod based system do not deliver on the sounds. The sound on this system is very good and much better then the other systems. That being said the other ipod systems are geared to be mobil. This system requires that you plug it in and does not have a battery option. I knew this before purchasing the unit so I have no complaints on the unit. This system is super easy to to install and get going.The only reason that do not get this unit 5 stars is because of the remote control. The remote works fine, but only has forwards/backwards plus stop/play with volume control. It would be nice to be able to select multiple playlist without having to get up and change it on the ipod."
4,Great sound and easy setup,"Great sound, especially bass. Easy to set up (just the power cord and appropriate adapter for your ""size"" iPod). Small size and nice appearance, so you can put it anywhere. Don't know why the power cord and power adapter ""brick"" have to be so large, but you can hide them behind the unit. I wish Bose marketed a little less: its annoying to know that so much of what you pay for it goes into those Bose stores, direct mail campaigns, etc."
5,What's the problem?,"I love the Bose docking station. In fact I have two: one for the living room and one for my bedroom. I have had no problems with either nor have I had problems with the remote controls. The sound is excellent. I am no novice having been a musician most of my life. I have played piano, cello, organ and harpsichord, but failing eyesight and arthritis have curtailed my playing. I am 73 and while my joints and eyes are failing me my hearing is excellent. I don't know if using my iPod only for music has anything to do with the success of performance of the Bose. I am sorry some people have had unfortunate experiences with this product."
5,I'd Buy It Myself,"I received the sounddock as a gift so I can't claim to have done nearly as much research or comparisons as most of the posters. Quite frankly, I probably would have been too thrifty to have splurged for this piece of hardware myself. That aside, the sound from this little box is awesome. As a couple of reviewers have noted, you can just keep turning it up and up with little or no sound degradation - quite amazing. The unit has a couple of small annoyances, such as the tangle of power cords and adapters in tow and the rather loose fit of 30GB video IPods, which seems to be a common theme across third party accessories. At the end of the day, I might have even felt compelled to splurge the $[...] myself had I the chance to spend a couple of days growing attached to the sound of this unit."
2,"Cheap Sound, High Price","I bought a Bose Sounddock for my wife for Christmas to go with her new 20 GB Ipod. Some of the reviews I had read made me concerned about sound quality, but my wife was really excited when she found out that she was getting a Bose. They're supposed to be the best, right? We turned it on, and we were both very disappointed with the sound quality. It sounded like more like speakers in an alarm clock-radio than a $300 unit. We took the Bose back to the store and bought an Altec Lansing inMotion IM7 speaker system for $50 less. The sound was rich and full, and the remote allows you to adjust bass and treble. Very much improved from the Bose. About all that I can say positive about the Bose is that it is a better looking unit than the IM7. Save your money."
2,After an year and a half it stopped working,It was ok while it lasted. After an year and a half it stopped working. The switching power supply has something loose inside. I expected better quality.
2,Does not charge new 4th generation Nano,"Outside of this box states it 'works with any ipod"" however I have confirmed with Apple, that the new 4th Generation Nano is unable to charge while docked to the system. Unfortunatley this is a deal breaker for me and I will have to return the system. I have heard that the JBL OnStage does."
1,"Great sound, but doesn't work","The SoundDock plays intermittently at best. We thought we had found the problem when we unplugged and plugged the two parts of the power cord together. It failed again last night. When we wanted to play the music with company.I'm returning this, and given the other reviews, don't want an exchange."
3,It does the job...but Just..,Paid $399 (Canadian) Would expect more features on the remote and better sound adjustment for that price. Does the job if you need a semi-portable speaker and are not one for concert-quality sound.
3,Bose SoundDock - first generation,"Item seemed to be as described but unfortunately, the speaker part didn't work (or at least I couldn't get it to work). Ipod was able to power up and charge though. Contacted seller to notify him - he was courteous and offered to refund cost immediately. Unfortunately, item wasn't packed very well so possible damaged during shipping? I would still purchase from buyer regardless - very professional and friendly...Thanx!"
2,not exactly what i wanted,"Disappointed that the dock doesn't charge ipod while playing. Also very disappointed that it doesn't take batteries to be portable (to the beach, ect.)Sound quality is good. Equipment is in good shape as indicated in post."
3,Know your vehicles limits before purchasing....,"I purchased this assuming it would be compatible with my car, unfortunately the audio system in my car does not support this type of unit, sound for the calls was not able to come through the audio system to keep I would of had to install the black speaker box somewhere in the car. We have a similar unit in another vechile and it works well through the audio system so it depends on your vechicle and the system it has. I will say the return process with Amazon and the seller was seamless, no issues at all. I learned the hard way, do your homework before you purchase one of these."
1,Not Satisfied,"At first this product seemed to be OK.... After time I realized that if cell phone reception was marginal so was the performance. If I was in a good cell phone reception area, it worked good. Contacts on the other end of calls complained of hearing every other word, which did not work for me. There are better units out there than this so pass on this one."
4,Much better than earpeices,This unit works great. Is much better than having to worry about the batteries in an earpeice. I did not use the speaker that it comes with. I purchased a wiring harness that allowed me to plug in directly into my stereo. The unit mutes the stereo and plays the audio over the truck speakers. I will be buying one for my girlfriend it works so well.
4,Best available,"This car kit is pretty great, I only have an occasional voice command issues. But other than that it was simple to install and setup."
4,Bluetooth works perfectly,The Motorola Bluetooth Car Kit is the best accessory I have bought for my cell phone.
4,"Hands Free, Headset Free Bluetooth Car Kit From Motorola","I have installed the car kit or rather had it professionally installed since it is integrated into my cars electrical and audio systems. The device faceplate can be located conveniently to allow use of the controls with minimal distraction from the traffic. To date I am very pleased with the unit. After the initial mating the devise will automatically activate when ever I get into the car with my cell phone on, in addition it can configured to accommodate up to four other cell phones so every member of the family can be hands free legal. It will also allow voice commands and will dial the number from your phones address book without having to reconfigure your phone list. This unit is a bit pricy however if you spend a lot of time in the car talking on your cell phone it is well worth the money."
2,Bad Buy - Not as easy as it should be,"I ordered this item with the expectation that it would work as advertised. After professional installation the unit was easy to pair with my Motorola MPx 220 SmartPhone, but then I realized that you have to pair it everytime you start the car. kind of defeats the purpose of this unit as I was expecting to be able to lerave the phone in my bag in the back seat/trunk.Beyond that it has minor functional problems. When you pick up a call it says, ""Call Ended,"" but the caller is picked up and talking. It takes a few seconds for the microphone to pick up your voice so you get to play the; ""Hello? Hello? Are you there? Can you hear me? game for a minute before actually being able to converse.All in all, I wish Motorola had done the install so they could help me troubleshoot it onsite.A bad-buy. Perhaps the Nokia kit would have been a better purchase."
1,Not so much,"I bought this based on other folks reviews, and had it professionally installed into my older Cadillac. The sound quality coming out of the speakers was great, lame that it didn't support A2DP but shame on me for not catching that- the bad part was the microphone pickup. We moved that thing all over the car to try to get something that didn't make me sound like I was calling them from a tin can in Australia, and no dice. Technology in cars has improved a ton, I don't get how neither this nor the Parrot 3100 can work worth a darn. Two thumbs down."
3,IHF1000 with Katana SCP-6600.,"I installed this car kit and paired it with my Sanyo SCP-6600 Katana cell phone. The voice recignition and sound quality are great. Everything works good with the system except for the pairing. Everytime I start my car the IHF1000 reports ""phone 1 ready."" Problem is that some numbers it dials, and some numbers it doesn't. I can call my home number via number recognition or from the contact list with no problems. But when I call other numbers the IHF1000 says ""call failed"" almost immediately. If I remove all paired phones from the IHF1000 (even though I only have my only phone paired) and re-pair my phone it works great.....until I shut my car off. So bottom line, even though my car kit says ""phone 1 ready"" everytime I start my car, certain numbers won't work unless I removed all phones then re-pair the phone each time. I've fooled with mulitple settings on my phone and still can't get it to work. Anybody have similar problems or know a work around? [...]"
3,"Good product, bad manufacturers information","Amazon had the best price for this product and it was delivered quickly. What the Motorola product information dosent explain is that for many, many cars, like my 2004 XJ8, is that for the device to operate as described through the factory sound system, additional wiring harness' are required. In the case of my Jag i n need three more harness' and the additional cost is $196 for the wiring. This is not Amazon's fault. I got lucky and found a good vendor for the needed stuff. I recommend that you contact your installer prior to purchase and ask if he has installed the device in you particular make and model, in the configuration you intend"
5,Wonderful Book,"I read previous Hendrick's titles and knew this one would be right up there with the best; I was not disappointed. I hope she never gives up writing, Judith has a way with words I seldom see. Her characters come alive for the reader and we can really relate to them. I look forward to future books by Judith Hendricks. The main character held her own while constantly meeting the shadow of the mother she never knew. I loved the path she followed right to the end."
5,YOU WON'T WANT TO PUT HIS BOOK DOWN!,"Avery James is left in the basement of foundling home by her young and frightened mother. Through many twists and turns of fate Avery slowly discovers who her mother is and more importantly, who Avery is herself. This novel is jam packed with a diverse assortment of vivid and fascinating characters. As an added bonus, you will be exposed to the culinary, cultural and artistic flavors of New Mexico, the ""Land of Enchantment"".Anyone who has ever thirsted to learn more about themselves, what they wanted and where they were going, will find something to identify with in this book."
5,Outstanding 2nd novel,"I highly recommend this book. I read it over the weekend and could not put it down. The main character, Avery, is a great storyteller and observer of others. The supporting characters are wonderful as well. Avery goes through much self discovery as she finds out about her mother's past and her own history. The setting is very much a part of the story with it's southwestern flair and mixture of anglo, mexican, and native american culture as Avery meets many people in her life. My only complaint would be that it ended! (Oh, and that I got hungry every time I read it...her description of the foods Avery eats and makes will make your mouth water!) I really look forward to more of her writing. This story reminded me in some ways of another of my favorite reads: Animal Dreams by Barbara Kingsolver."
5,Serendipitous Find!,"This is one of the best books I have read in years. I loved Avery and Will! I wanted the book to last forever. Sorry I finished it...more, please."
2,broke in 4 months,"I purchased this for my daughter it was great initially. However one of the microphones broke after 3 months, the color started going in and out after 4 months and now is completely out. It's not worth the extra money to have the tv/dvd component since it is only black and white. Also you have to have the sound up pretty high to hear your voice through the speaks. For a 9 year old it is fine and she loves it, but it doesn t' work the way it should. There are so many other options I do not recommend this one."
2,"only ok, and only when it's working","This was a present for me since I love to sing. It works ok for karoke--but only when it works. It often has a cd error, or says there's no cd when there is. It's a huge waste for anything else, since the screen is so small. It's heavy and hard to move. The mics it comes w/ are terrible. I am able to adjust the volume and use a separately purchased wireless memorex microphone that sounds good w/o having to be right up against your mouth. When it works, it's fine for an at-home w/ the family or a few friends karoke night, but we're shopping for a new system that will play all the discs ALL the time."
1,"Primarily lists low-fat and ""lite"" foods.","Of all the fat/calorie/cholesterol count books I've seen, this has been the least helpful. The inclusion of brand names for the listed food items is nice, however the vast majority of foods are those already reduced, or naturally low, in fat and calorie content. Thus comparisons cannot be made with non-diet versions. Unless these are the ONLY foods you consume, you will still need to reference another source to calculate your fat and calorie consumption."
4,Helpful Information on Sodium in Fresh Food,This is the only book I have found so far that has information on sodium in fresh food. I find the book somewhat confusing to use but it does give me the information I seek.
1,Too hard to find things,It was so hard to find the particular foods I was looking for that it just wasn't woirth the effort. It would be more helpful to have generic listings. Now I either look things up on the web (like the websites of restraunts) or jot down key metrics from the FDA label on the package before I throw it away.
5,Make Sure to Use Correct Size Square Head,"It's embarrassing for me, as I thought these screws were breaking when in fact I was using a too small square head that at some point twisted free in the socket. If you use the correct size square head (number 2) on your impact wrench, the screws will work wonderfully.Bosch CCSQ2205 Number 2 Square Recess, 2-Inch 5 Pack"
5,Great read!,"I was very pleased with this book, covers Chakras, Crystals, Laying on of Hands healing, a great read for the women!"
1,Still waiting for my shipment,"I would very much like to review this product, but since I still haven't received it, I can do no such thing. Never has it taken so long for a parcel to be received. I am very dissappointed. Usually my orders from amazon.com arrive within two weeks. However, I have made the order on the 12/12/2010 and I am still waiting for it."
3,Different than what I thought it would be,"This movie was a bit blood thirsty but I enjoyed it as David Boreanaz was in it and played a good part. It was a bit slow at first but bear with it, it gets better"
2,Ghosts Writer,This DVD was not for me. If it were'nt for the cast and their previous performances I would'nt have purchased this dvd on it's own merits as it did not justify their true acting abilities. The dialogue is too long winded and totally above my comprehensive level. The crux of the story line came too late and finished rather open ended. I consider myself to be in to a good story but didn't feel it in this instance. My apologies to others who may find it gripping.
2,wrong kind of B12,"What I like about Twinlab products is that they come in glass, so I'm not trashing the planet with more plastic. I've been happy with other Twinlab products for years.Sadly, I've learned about a serious problem with this B vitamin product. It contains the wrong form of B12--cyanocobalamin. According to the information I've received, this form cannot be digested without stealing methyl needed for other purposes. The form of B12 that is usable and best digested by the body is methylcobalamin. For most people taking B12 orally is not as effective as sublingually, or better yet, in a patch. I'm sorry I've been taking this, as it seems that taking cyanocobalamin could be worse for my usable B12 levels than taking no supplement at all."
2,Rock Excursion for Celtic Singer,"John has done a number of really good albums, focussing on accoustic Celtic and Celtic style music. I always look forward to finding more CDs he has put out. However, this CD appears to have been a change in direction for him--much more rock-influenced and electric. I have pretty wide tastes and I like a lot of rock music, but unfortunately, this genre doesn't seem to be his strength. He doesn't perform rock well and the music is pretty boring, if loud and electric. If you like his other stuff, you will probably be disappointed by this. If you are looking for a rock album, or a celtic-influenced rock album, there are many better places to look."
4,Review of Marine Painting in Oil,"I purchased this book for my husband to help him with painting seascapes and he found it extremely useful and understandable. It's instructions on how to paint the eye of the wave were easy to understand and overall, he was very pleased with it's details and illustrations."
4,seascape p;ainting,"It came well recommended, so I thought I would try it.I am working with it now, so I will have further info as I go along."
3,decent album,"This band has a cool style that sets them apart from the manufactured emo bands. There is a lot of rocking tracks, and a few lower tempo ones. All in all a good listen"
4,good collection,"yes it could be better but this collection has some cool tracks especially from the System, Michael cooper and Isley,Jasper and Isley. these songs all hold up really well and the Grooves are cool.Levert had a tight jam with Pop,Pop,Pop goes my mind. cool tracks."
1,want to read other reviews,"I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THE BOOK IS ABOUT! I THOUGHT THAT IS WHY THERE ARE BOOK REVEIWS, SO YOU KNOW IF YOU SHOULD BUY THE BOOK! YOU SHOULD REALLY HAVE THE REVEIWS POSTED SO THE CUSTOMER CAN READ THEM."
5,Acid Rage,One of best titles i ever heard - such an emotional song that i don't will stop loving since the first time listening.
5,The Embroiderer's Country Album,"This book is absolutely fantastic, but who would expect anything less from Helen Stevens! It will certainly be one of my favorite ""go to"" books."
3,Noddy is American? Huh?!,"Having grown up reading the Noddy books by Enid Blyton and then discovering the series on youtube for my one-year-old to watch (he LOVES them), I was thrilled to find it at such a reasonable price on Amazon. However, when our DVD came and we popped it in, imagine my surprise to find that Noddy and all his friends had suddenly become Americans! Huh?!!! I do NOT understand why PBS (or whoever) felt like it needed to be completely redubbed for an American audience. British English is completely intelligible--well for the most part--if you don't let kids hear British accents they might grow up to become like my friend who was unable to watch any of my awesome BBC dramas because she couldn't understand what they were saying, and that would be real shame :^) Seriously toying with sending this back and continuing to watch it on youtube."
4,GOOD NEW AUTHOR,"This is the first time I have read this author. The plot is good and kept me guessing until about halfway through. THe author gives hints through out the story. She also accuratly portrays the real-life delimna people who have large churches may be faced with. She exposes the lies of a ""perfect family"" and brings to light repentence of the heart. I think the ending could have played out a little longer, however. A good addition to my Chirstian mystery collection. I have a feeling the second book in the series may follow the evangelists youngest son, Brent."
2,Too disjointed to be really useful,"Some good information, but the book is too disjointed to be really useful. It's a collection of separate articles by various authors. There is no index, making it difficult to quickly locate information on specific topics."
4,Classic gold,"There are very few authors who can tempt so strongly that you are left wishing they had produced many more in a series. Michael Lewin is one such author. My advice: Find these classic gems and savor them. I am not as much a fan of his more recent works, but the older ones do not disappoint on any level, and satisfy on most."
1,Platinum Collection - 8 Movie Pack,"I was trying to get the movie ""Bear Island"" and this 8 movie pack DVD popped up. That indicated to me that the movie I wanted was included in the lot. I tried to find out exactly movies were contained, but with no luck. ""Bear Island"" was not one of them and I didn't like any of the other movies. I believe the advertising and lack of info was extremely misleading."
5,One of my son's favorites!!,"I purchased this DVD in an effort to help my two year old son with his ABCs...and it definitely worked. He loves this video and wants to watch it over and over, and it still continues to hold his attention and interest. I recommend it highly for simple, fun alphabet learning for your little one!"
1,Disappointing,"I bought this after reading the great reviews on Amazon.com. I was very disappointed. For a DVD, the quality was very poor. It was also boring. My daughter prefers Baby Einstein, Sesame Street, and Brainy Baby."
5,Fabulous! Why don't they put this out on DVD again?,"As expected, my 2 year old can't get enough of Richard Scarry. My older four boys watched the Scarry videos when they were younger. When they outgrew them, I sold them in a garage sale. Enter baby #5, a total surprise. When I decided to re-buy these for him, I discovered they were no longer available. VHS copies are easy to come by used, but used DVDs cost a fortune. I'm buying one at a time over a period of a few months so as not to break the bank. Worth every penny, though. We don't watch television around here, but my 2 year old is spellbound every time I turn this on. He's recognizing all of his letters, too, which makes me feel better about turning this video every now and again."

5,Great Lessons!,"I LOVE this DVD. We just rented it from the video store and I will be buying it for sure. It teaches really great lessons like eating your vegetables, going to bed nicely, how to talk on the phone....It is really cute too."
4,This is a good one!,"We bought this one after reading the other positive reviews and it didn't disappoint. My 3 year old really likes the skits in this dvd and I find them to be great lessons to learn in a positive way. The family unit is so important these days and this dvd includes mom, dad, and sis in every story. It's very loving and gentle. We bought the Growing Up With Hello Kitty 2 because we liked this one so much. #2 is great too!"

5,love songs,Good merchandise came in a timely manner . very happy with transaction. Thanks Lonnie Rocha
4,This book is a kick,"This book is a kick to read, especially if you are of the age to remember most of the matches and the circumstances surrounding them; and if your not you'll find out what tennis used to be all about. I like the way Drucker wound his story throughout without getting in the way of, or better yet, co-opting the Connors story. The two seemed to intertwine seemlessly. Like others have said, it brought back a time when tennis had a meaning beyond the game and players, specifically Connors, that transcended sports. Lest we forget, Drucker has reminded us of those times."
1,Utterly nauseating,"I coudn't agree more with the Amazon review here by Milacik Najdrahsi - I, too, was very much looking forward to reading this, having idolised Connors as a teenager myself, but this book is one of the worst I have ever read, a horrid, self-regarding author's ego trip, replete with the worst kind of American psycho-babble and pitiful philosophising about personal family difficulties, self improvement and the pursuit of 'success'. There is a prolonged, ghastly, obsequious chronicle of a highly ambiguous and suspect 'friendship' with Connors together with endless, embarrassing accounts of Mr. Drucker's own laughable tennis exploits (or 'career', as he likes to call it), with some atrocious writing to boot. It was extremely painful to cringe my way through to the end. I like to think that if Connors himself has read this he would have found it as loathsome as I did. A zero star rating from me... avoid at all costs, it will make you ill."
1,joel drucker made my life miserable !!!!!,"yes ,that's right-i was expecting so much from this book and all i got was drucker's babbling about himself,his flimsy tennis play and wacko bro-and little bit of connors.there was not a word of explanation why he considers connors being paranoid,narcisstic etc.,as he said in the beginning of the book(i guess this was the reason of connors's refusal of writing his bio by drucker).maybe this got something to do with his ""jewish liberal"" background...anyway,this book sucks sooooo much and next time i'll run intodrucker in somewhere,i'm gonna ask him for my money back..."
2,running out of steam,I used to love Jayne Ann Krentz but this book has pretty much ended it for me. The plot is pretty good but the hero and heroine just didn't grab me. The book seems tired as if the author is running out of steam.
1,Took this one back to Borders....,"Hmmm.. not up to her usual, didn't like the hero at all.. seemed like a Jerk.. Im not too picky about heros.. but there has to be something likeable..Also, the herione was a bit too whiny.. sorry.. didn't keep it long enough to talk about the plot.Ive read enough of her that I picked this one up at full hardback price.. mistake.. lets hope next one is more on track.."
3,"enjoyable, low-key banter","Jack and Elizabeth, the hero and heroine, are more like a fun married couple than people in the throes of falling in love. Although I agree with most reviewers' comments about the plot, I still liked the book. It's like a buddy movie in the guise of film noir. The plot was just the background for some polished and enjoyable dialog. There wasn't a lot of drama in Jack and Elizabeth's relationship. Although Jayne Ann Krentz set up a fairly dramatic conflict, the characters seemed like people who knew they were right for each other but were just giving each other a hard time. Listening to these two strong, confident, fairly normal characters banter was fun. They're a great match."
2,Not exactly her best,"I'm a devoted JAK fan, and read all of her books whenever they come out. I love her novels as Quick and Castle also, but I must agree with previous reviews. JAK has found a formula that worked for her in the beginning: Deep Waters and Absolutely Postively. But now the books seem to be all the same. The two main characters give off the same persona that are the same in each book. But the quality of her books has not gotten any better, especially her last couple of books. I would wait for this one to come out in paperback...unless you simply can not live without your JAK fix"
4,Slight dulling of the shine,"I love Krentze's book no matter the name under which she writes because her characters are quirky, lively, and real. _Soft Focus_ is another hit in a long line of hits for the author and once again readers meet some interesting people. who cares that the mystery is a little thin. The only thing that does dim the shine of the book for me is the language. I am well aware that people do use such expletives and terms but I discourage them from doing so in my vicinity. I was sorry to see such objectionable terms in an otherwise enjoyable book. I found the swearing unnecessary. A good book marred by the unfortunate use of what I think excessive use of expletives. You may not think so."
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY - EVEN IN PAPERBACK,"This book is a far cry from the author's novels written in the 1980's. This reads more like a beginner's endeavour than a seasoned artist. To call the characters two dimensional is giving them too much credit. Shallow characterization and a weak, weak story line. Her last three books have all the same story line and each has been worse than the last. I will not buy another new book. I may not even bother to check it out of the library. A total, total disappointment! Unfortunately, Amazon requires at least one star in the ""rate"" field or I would have given it ZERO."
3,Same great stuff with a new twist,"I have always enjoyed JAK, with the exception of her last few novels. Soft Focus reedems JAK as one of my favorite romance authors. There is still the stereotypical JAK characters- the corporate shark who is afraid of love and the woman who is forced to work with him, eventually succumbing to his good lucks and rough charm. However, JAK fans will be suprised to see the backdrop and tone of the book is in the film noir style. Although this is the first time she has written in this genre, she has done a more than adequate job to make this book enjoyable. Keep it coming!"
2,Not a keeper,"This latest book of Jayne Ann Krentz is a far cry from her usual style of writing. I've read every one of her books and was disappointed by this recent release. Her books have always been enthralling, entertaining and a true joy to read. Soft Focus was very different from her other books. While the use of crude language itself did not bother me, it was out of context with the story. The action between the main characters was disjointed. There was no strong feeling of romance between the characters nor was there much development of the characters love for each other. The story did not flow nor did it make any sense. Being a fan of Krentz, I would still purchase any book she writes, but this one is not one to save to read again. The style is so different from her other work that it is as if someone else wrote it. Wait for it to come to your local library rather than purchasing it."
3,Sparkling style and wit?,"Don't get me wrong, I love Jayne Ann Krentz's books and probably have everyone she has ever written. In fact I had this book on order months before it was released. Every review I read on it talked about its sparkling style and wit, superb dialogue, intricate suspense, steamy passion. So why do I feel let down over this book? This is a comfortable book by Ms. Krentz -a good read, but not one I'll have the desire to read over and over. While reading this book, I wanted to be swept off my feet into another world, to lose myself in the story. That didn't happen. Will I buy another book by Ms. Krentz - yes, she is one of those authors that has never written a bad book. However, unless you are desperate for something to read, wait until this one comes out in paperback."
1,Soft Focus Will Put You In Dreamland,"What happened to JAK? Used to love her books. This is the second one in a row I can't even finish (ok did cheat and read the last chapter).I felt like I'd read this book 100 times before. Same heroine, same prickly hero, with a murder thrown in to throw them together. Also I didn't really warm up to either character, which makes it hard to care what happens to them.Don't waste your time on this snoozer. Check out some of her early titles for a good read."
2,Sleepytime,"It took effort to finish this boring, drawn out story. When the end came I had forgotten the purpose of the beginning. Jack is a macho businessman, Elizabeth is a power business women. The main subject is a crystal, named Soft Focus that is stolen, and throws them together in a search they don't seem to take very serious. Noir film festival comes into play, not exciting or mysterious. This book almost made my Waste of Time rating."
5,Typical J.A.K.! Great!,"All you really need is Jayne Ann Krentz's name on a book to know it's more than worth the time and money. Her books never fail to give you a diverse and interesting group of characters, plenty of twists and turns, a great love story, exciting settings, and a few surprises thrown into the mix for good measure. Elizabeth and Jack spent only one night together, but we feel like we've been there from their first glance. Elizabeth is a tough as nails, smart, succesful business woman who has no intention of letting the handsome company head pull the wool over her eyes. Their dialog together crackles (especially their resteraunt showdown) and the Film Noir Festival setting is written with enough detail and description to be informative, and yet not be overbearing.Jack and Elizabeth make a great couple, but it's no less than we expect from Ms. Krentz. Don't wait for the paperback, get this one now. . . and enjoy! Bravo!"
4,soft focus,"I thought the dialogue was every bit as witty and funny as any of her best titles. This is not great literature, but a fun read for a cold winter's night."
2,Un-baked cake...,"I used to really enjoy JAK, but her recent books have been less than wonderful. This book almost pushed me to give up on her. It's as if she doesn't care about character development or emotional intensity. I got the impression she was writing a Harlequinn novel (no offense to Harlequin fans) or that she had a deadline to get a book out. She didn't even seem to do much research with reference to the technology that was the focus of the story-line.Not her best effort. Try Linda Howard, if you want to remember what JAK used to be like..."
2,Soft Focus,"I have been a fan of JAK for years and i got to say i'm a little disapointed at her latest. it lacks her earlier intensity. i feel that the character are underdeveloped and that overall it did not keep me from putting the book down. i usually have to keep reading to find out what happens next, but this book was too predictable and dry. i hope her next shows what she can do as a writer."
2,plot not well flushed out,Rather boring - I had a force myself to finish it (now I wish I hadn't). I just thought it would get better. Save your time.
2,Boring,"I finally gave up on this book around page 200 and moved on. Can Krentz develop another plot other than the Seatle business man, saving a family business? She did it best with Wildest Hearts and she has failed to live up to that success here. Even the love scenes were boring, well, actually nonexistant and the characters were flat. Skip this book and save yourself the boredom."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"Jayne Ann Krentz is one of the most satisfying Romance authors working in the genre today. Her plots move along crisply, her dialogue entertains, and her heroines are engaging, intelligent women to whom a reader can actually relate.That said, I think she's falling into a rut, at least with regard to her contemporary/suspense novels. Soft Focus was al too similar to her other books. I'd like to see Krentz stretch her wings and try something different, like oh--say, a setting that isn't the Pacific Northwest? A plot that doesn't revolve around corporate malfeasance and derring-do? Krentz's books are becoming too predictable, which is a pity, because there's a lot to like about her writing."
2,God(dess) in the machine?,Too formulaic and a great disappointment. The identitiy of femme fatale really comes out of left field and seems very contrived. I hope JAK gets back on track and that this book is not the beginning of a trend.
2,Sub Par Burke,"This book wasn't very good. Other of Burke's books are much, much better. This book is really about one stubborn family, the Sonniers. It doesn't really have a purpose to it. It is slow paced and boring. I was looking for more pages when it ended because I couldn't believe that was it. It was a big let down after finishing A Morning for Flamingos which is fantastic. Skip A Stained White Radiance and read something else by Burke."
3,A Step Back,"After reading many of the earlier novels, I was disappointed by this one. We get the usual rich descriptions of bayou settings and life in this corrupt environment. Characters just don't have the appeal that I felt in the earlier novels, and the subplots don't really support the overall theme.Several of those subplots never get anywhere near resolved by the close of the novel, so we are left hanging, so to speak, wishing that they had either been omitted or woven more completely into the piece."
5,TRULY BIZARRE...daddys home,Lots of weird twists and turns. Not as urgently paced as most D.Robicheaux stories but so what. Highly recommended
3,Not his best,"I'm reading his books in order and this is number 5. It's not as boring as Black Cherry Blues but certainly falls far short of the other 3. This one can be skipped as like Black Cherry it contains no ""significant"" changes in Dave's life."
2,Show me the story !!!,"This was my first Burke. Great character depictions, but little story. When I finished, I was certain the publisher had left off the last chapter(s). It seems as though it was written by a committee that had very few meetings. In essence, much ado about not much."
2,Believe the two stars reviews,"Skip this one, really. Don't even bother. Go for the ""Confederates"" if you are looking for a first or second dip.I'm giving two stars only because there are a few brilliant one-liners here and there. But you won't find a real plot or anything to keep you awake on this one.Just plain boring."
3,Flawed Ending,"If it has James Lee Burke's name on it, I read it. A STAINED WHITE RADIANCE is not Burke's best plot construction.Dave Robicheaux encounters childhood friends, the Stonniers. Victims of abuse they are not the same people he knew as a child. The ending leaves you expecting a sequel. But I will keep my first edition copy on my shelves for the quality of his story telling.Nash Black, author of SANDPRINTS OF DEATH."
4,James Lee Burke,"I don't have time to review all of James Lee Burke's books, so this will have to stand in for all of them. I'm currently up to the book entitled ""Jolie Blon's Bounce"". All of his books are very descriptive and well-written, and he makes me feel like I am back in Louisiana where I grew up as I read it, and even discovering parts of the state to which I have not yet been. I want to be able to write like him one day, and until then, I'll be practicing."
4,Another Strong Outing for Burke,"I've read the first five of the Dave Robicheaux series in order and have not yet been disappointed at all. Burke has quickly become one of my favorites authors; too bad it took me so long to start reading his work. Dave Robicheaux is simply a good, tough guy. He's fair, flawed yet balanced, determined, strong and justice-minded. This book has several interweaving stories within one overall deep plot. Robicheaux faces off against organized crime, white supremacists, and a family with ties to both and several family secrets. All the while he is a great dad and husband, and true friend to Clete and Batiste. I'm stunned more of the Robicheaux novels haven't made their way to television movies or the big screen - the main character and the story-telling are that good and that engrossing."
2,Sapani Ma is no new music from Nepal,"Sapani Ma is no new music from Nepal. If you have listened to the new generation Nepali songs, you might have already listened to similar music. The lyrics are indifferent and lacks the luster of good wordings."
1,poorly written,"This book is an introduction to investing in corporate restructuring. Unfortunately, it is very flabby and poorly written, much less helpful than the insultingly titled but brilliant book by Joel Greenblatt ""You can be a stock market genius."" Go to pages 67-69 and you will see photocopies of price lists and stock charts taking up two full pages. This is typical of the padding that makes up too much of this book. Leave this one alone."
3,Risk Arb 101,This book is risk arb 101 anyone looking to learn arb or model spreads should take a look
4,Risk Arbitrage Analysis Framework,"This book outlines a solid framework to assess risk arbitrage opportunities. The author describes types of transactions and the elements of return, risk, and probability to systematically analyze a deal. A number of useful formulas are included. However, a more thorough discussion on collar deals would be helpful."
3,a good starting point,"By the time you are done with this book, you will hunger for greater detail on the fascinating topic of merger arbitrage. For the most part, the book glosses over in mostly limited detail the key steps in understanding merger arbitrage. The author's considerable experience has allowed him to convey a somewhat complicated topic in non-complicating language. The author could have offered a more animated and detailed walk through of previous deals, to involved the reader in the drama that often unfolds during the lifetime of deals. Anyone with some degree of financial acumen, or who is interested in perhaps starting a hedge fund, will find it an incomplete discussion, but a very worthy read along the way toward greater mastery of this subject."
1,"good introduction, but on a very basic level indeed","Imagine a financial institution. You are a fresh graduate recruit, and you are put on the risk arbitrage desk. So the head of risk arbitrage trading takes you out for a coffee and talks about his business in very basic terms, not giving away anything (in case he decides that you don't fit into his group). So you walk away knowing what risk arbitrage is (if you haven't known already), but no more.But then again, he might not even take you out for coffee, in which case this book will do the job just as well.In short, this is only recommended for absolute beginners."
3,good for a beginner,"It's ok for a beginner, covers the basics and gives a few anecdotes from his investment career, that's about it. I would recommend Merger Arbitrage by Kirchner because it basically covers this whole book in its first chapter(just makes me wonder how does did the author take a whole book to cover the info Kirchner did in a single chapter) and it has 12 more! Just think of the information difference between the two books."
3,Church 585 toilet seat,"Replaced broken seat with this item. Construction was excellent. Only problem, seat will not stay up. I expected this brand to at least operate like the one I replaced."
5,This is the must-have book for Italian travel,"It was late, raining and we were starved. We had just checked into our hotel in Verona and needed a good meal to put our spirits back on track. That's when we dug out our little red guide and found a 4 star restaurant within walking distance. Don't let the fact that it's all written in Italian put you off. I have no language skills and found it easy to use and quite indispensable. While it's difficult to have a truly bad meal in Italy, with this book it's amazingly simple to have a positively great one."
5,beloved stories,I enjoyed this book when I was a child. I purchased it to pass the joy of these rich stories on to my grandchildren. In re-reading the stories I tried to understand the current prediliction to classify them as racially insensitive. As a child my thoughts about uncle Remus were positive. He felt like a comfortable relative with a country accent and point of view. This is the image I will pass on to my grandchildren.
5,Cool Book,This book brought back so many childhood memories of when I would sit under my favorite tree in the summertime and read this book and imagine living in that time.A very playful book for dreaming.
3,Not sufficient to their glorious talent.,"These recordings have been apparently extracted from the actual films themselves. Much of the clarity is missing from the artists' individual recordings of the songs from the 1930s (And a bit too much of the films' sappy orchestration comes through). To appreciate the remarkable songs of Mr. Berlin, Mr. Gershwin & Gershwin, and Mr. Porter, one should listen to a previously released collection of their songs on ""Starring Fred Astaire"""
4,XOSIZE wheel,the exercise wheel is a must have for fast upper abdominal exercise I use the wheel at least twice weekly and after 3 weeks I began seeing results PRONTO!!And its not expensive like other abdominal products..When using the wheel must be really careful rolling down or might cause a back injury.Yes i would recommend the wheel
4,Works Great!,"Creates good tension on the abs, works great and will get you a 6-pack. Time and patience. I recommend this product and workout for abs."
2,Not to my liking...,When I use it as shown by directions I only feel a tiny mild burn that is nowhere near what I feel with a simple situp and it puts a lot of weight on my wrists which in my case isn't a good thing. Decided I don't like it not going to use it anymore.
5,gee~!!!!,"Sometimes the simplest thing can be the best thing in the world. Gee, I wish I came up with this gadget, I would be a millionaire by now. If you want to work your arms, abs, back, just use this EVIL WHEEL everyday. Forget about Sit Ups, and wasting money on BIG HEAVY machine. This Wheel can be used for ANYONE ANY age, ANY sex, and of course at ANY place~! Do not worry, I will come up with some gadget next time and be a millionaire! We all be glad I did"
2,the definitive review,"plastic tires instead of rubber ones. minus one point.plastic handle instead of cushion foam or gel. minus one point.no spacer to separate the wheels. then when you put your own spacer in (for stability) the bar becomes too short (handles don't go on all the way). minus one point.i took mine down to the bike store and asked my bicycle mechanic to modify it. he put a spacer in between the wheels and gel grips. will have to live with the plastic tires. i tried it out, and it worked.i never tried to use it without the modifications. maybe it would have worked just as well as shipped. after all, it's not like you're going to be using them all day. just a few reps.paid attention to the suggestion of using a wall to stop the forward movement, and to take it easy on the first go. i'll continue to use it and see what happens."
2,"Okay, not great","It's okay, but all you can do is go forward and back or diagonally, so it's pretty repetitive and gets boring quickly. You can kind of feel it in your abs, but personally I think sit-ups are probably better exercise than this thing."
3,Good product,Is definitely a good equipment.I correct two things: Stability maybe adding something to separated the wheel; a more wide tube.
1,WTH?,"Ok, I'm a pretty fit guy. I play soccer weekly, run two or three times a week, and I lift weights and do yoga. From the first time I used this device it cause pain in my lower back, as did it with my wife and my brother.I target my lower back often, and I'm athlete, no exercise should hurt. This thing hurt.Every gym has one of these, I suggest trying it out before you buy, because I ended up throwing mine in the garbage."
5,Should have bought a LONG time ago!,"I have never owned a piece of ab equipment quite like this. You FEEL the burn in your exercise, much more than the traditional sit-up! I would highly recommend this product to anyone who likes to work out their abs. You feel the tightness all over your mid-section and arms. The product is very sturdy and made very well. A++"
5,Effective and affordable.,"Chairs with fancy attachments, hours of exercise video, and hundreds of crunches could never give you the stomach this exercise wheel will.Very sturdy, easy to assemble and use, efficient, it's perfect for someone that wants results fast and can't designate a few hours a week to strengthening their core."
4,not bad,"who ever thought this little thing could work so well? would recommend to others, been using it for 2 weeks everyday and noticed a difference. only con i have is the grip and that today my back started to hurt so i don't know if its the wheel or the way i slept."
3,"Overall, I don't regret the purchase","I have trouble with this because I lack muscle, but I definitely feel it working. The downside to this is that the handles hurt your hands when put your weight on them to roll back and forth."
3,Good but not for a beginer....,"It does work great can really feel it in your abs just by doing a few Total plus can tell it works. Not for beginners though i just recently had a baby and im trying to get back into my workut routine, Im really going to work into this . But with some daily workouts im sure ill get it in no time.Also Dont use this on carpet with shorts, you will hurt your knees."
3,"Works well on abs, but...","The exercise wheel works well on abs, but it hurts my wrists, and seems to have very limited utility. There were no instructions/exercises included, except a booklet of exercises you can do with Everlast's other products. Also, I found this same product at TJMaxx for a few dollars less after I had already purchased it through Amazon."
5,Good core!,"I like this product for the extra strengthening of the core. I add my sit-ups, planks and TRX to this product and I recommend."
4,Love to hate it!,"This is an awesome product. I was a little worried about durability but it is built really well. It gives a really tough workout, but it an awesome fit for my workout routine."
1,KarateDepot is terrible and unresponsive,"I ordered this Everlast Ab Wheel from KarateDepot as a gift. On the day before I was supposed to receive the shipment, the company notified me that I would not get the order for another 7-10 days because they were ""Out of stock"", even though the item was listed as ""In Stock"" when I ordered. This made my gift late. After 18 days, it HAS NOT EVEN BEEN SHIPPED yet. Also, they have not changed the status of the item online to ""Out Of Stock"" to prevent other people from making this mistake and ordering again. I have emailed them 4 times with no response. They still have not even replied to ONE of my emails. The gift I intended to send is almost 3 weeks late and I cancelled my order altogether. This business is terrible."
1,it cane with missing hand grips dissipointed in company who oversaw shipping and quality control,I am dissipated that no person can do a job that they are paid to do. The product came with missing hand grips and it was a obvious because the packing was clear and you could see where the parts were missing. I just bit the bullet and trashed the remainder of the parts and went to Target and bought a nicer nodle for 1/2 the costSorryDissipated
2,Molestias sobre el ejercicio,"El uso del Everlast Wheel es muy incomodo. Despues de realizar los ejercicios y series, terminas con molestias y dolores en la parte baja de la espalda."
4,Awesome work out.,"This is an awesome piece of equipment for stomach crunches. If you are new to doing wheels and don't exercise as much as I have start off doing a few and work your way up; otherwise, prepare for pain!"
5,It works,"I bought this product because my PT said I needed to strengthen my core muscles due to a herniated disk that looked like it would require surgery. I bought this and started out very slow no more than 5 a day and I seem to be getting better an I don't think surgery is going to be required I highly recommend this, but start out slow and make sure you do the movements correctly."
4,Excercise wheel works great!,"I've used this product for 4 months.Very cheap price, good quality, no problems, and it does the job well. I don't have any complaints."
1,Very flimsy,"Not sturdy at all. Broke after a few sessions of light use. I'm 150 pounds so it was not me, it was the wheel!"
5,my best investment in home exercise equipment,"Over the years I've purchased all sorts of home exercise equipment from simple weights to a gym-quality treadmill. The exercise wheel has perhaps given me my best return on investment. It's a simple device but it really works. Following the instructions and some online recommendations, I started out easy. Even with initially scaled back use I really worked my abs and felt it the next day. My wife started laughing when she saw me working out with the wheel. I challenged her to do a few. She was feeling her abs for the next few days!After a solid month with the Duo Exercise wheel and gradually working my way up to more reps, I can see the results in the mirror. Some pretty good definition developing.For $9.99 on Amazon I would highly recommend giving the Everlast Standard Duo Exercise Wheel a try. It's simple to use and requires only a few minutes a day to achieve noticeable results."
3,Grip is hard on your hands,"My wheel from GoFit ( [...] ) developed a small crack in a wheel. The Everlast wheel was the same price, but on sale. The GoFit wheel has a comfortable foam rubber grip. The Everlast has a hard plastic grip with ridges. Otherwise they are the same size. For the same money, GoFit is the better choice. GoFit is also better than the Valeo wheel's semi hard rubber grip."
3,more than a primer,"Although this product does go on evenly and smoothly, has a nice smell, and gives me no acne, it is too thick to just be a primer. I usually use it before bare minerals foundation but its very thick and makes my skin oily"
4,Wonderful but outdated,"I'll be joining a fixed income trading desk in a few months and picked up this book to gain some additional insights. If you have some exposure to the fixed income markets, this book will do a wonderful job of supplementing that knowledge. The chapters on pricing the roll, determining richness/cheapness to the curve, and financing (i.e., repo) are invaluable. As another reader mentioned, the writing is a bit outdated, but it still provides a lot of good information. I think it also focuses too much on Macaulay duration at the outset, leaving aside the more often-used DV01 (Garbade refers to it as ""value of a basis point"") until much later. Still, there are few good books on the subject of fixed income markets, and this is definitely one of them."
5,Excellent book by an excellent OT,"When our son was 2-3 and having sensory issues, Lindsey was recommended to us by our doctor. She did a complete workup and analysis of our son, and helped us get the help and services we needed. The book was instrumental in helping us prepare and figuring out what was next. We were lucky to get the one-on-one time with Lindsey b/c we live in NYC, but if you're experiencing something similar to SPD, I would highly recommend you buy this book. You will be relieved and informed at the same time. A must for parent with kids with sensory issues...."
5,Great reference for anyone dealing with a child with SPD,"I'm a mental health therapist as well as a parent of a child with SPD. This is my favorite book both for myself and the parents of my SPD clients. This book is great for family members of kids with SPD, without additional disorders.Generally, the book that is most recommended is The Out of Sync Child, which is a wonderful book. However, the Out of Sync Child is geared more toward SPD kids with more severe disorders (autism, Asperger's Disorders, etc). Raising a Sensory Smart Child is a perfect reference for children with SPD without accompanying disorders. It provides answers and guidance for for families who have been wondering ""what's wrong"" for a long time. I'd recommend this book not only for parents, but for teachers, therapists, as well as grandparents, daycare providers and anyone dealing with SPD kids. Truly an educational read."
4,sensory awareness,This book was aewsome and made me realize how many people suffer from sensory issues and that my child is normal. A great read!
3,Good Read,ordered this book as a kindle read..i gave it three stars this far because i am not done reading it. so far this book hit on all of the behavior points that I have been experiencing with my interaction with an aspeger child. all teachers should have a copy of this book so it can help them understanding what a person with sensory problems are trying to communicate instead of saying the child has chronic behavior problems..there is a huge difference as I see it now. will update as i finish the book.
4,Broadening Sector of Secuation,"With the broadening of considerations that impact the educational efforts for youngsters, no matter what segment of childhood, this author brings to discussion and increased the reader's knowledge of the effects of the senses on the acquisition of experiences and cognitive awareness.The influence of the array of sensory input upon the human systems is discussed.Additional, I add, the the resulting showering effects of brain chemistry upon the developing individual is a vital element in child rearing.As an educator and author I recommend to young parents considering my series of training materials for the preschool sector of youngsters. With use of these materials, the child will gain mastery of physical skills and achieve that ""I can do that!"" feeling in their movement experiences.Feet Firstexplore the five other KidSKILLS Training Manuals and try to incorporate their ideas in your family's daily activities.Feet FirstFeet First [VHS]"
2,Mix Up,"I'm not baggin on this CD, but for all you country fans out there, this is not the Jake Owen country artist. I got this album on mistake, its a good album, but its not from the artist I intended."
5,I LOVE IT!,"This looks so great in my son's bedroom. I love the different pegs you can use with the pictures, date, and name. Easy to hang."
4,Unique Growth Chart,"This was a gift for a friend's 6 year old son. I thought this was a real unique item for kids and luckily her little boy loved it! He hung it up right away along with his other Harley Davidson gift. I always knew my friend liked Harley's and now her son does too. He especially likes the chart since he always asks his mom if he is getting taller, now she can tell him he can see for himself. Sturdy with a great design!"
4,Awesome,"This installment to the Yu Yu Hakusho series really helped me find out more about Yoko and Yomi. Very nice, with some excellent fight scenes.Definately a must to any fan of the series. If you can buy it you should."
5,Simply charming...,"These excerpts of the original musicals by Gary Schocker are simply a pleasure to listen to. This shows once more, that Musical Theatre litterature can range in a wide variety of styles. Far From the Madding Crowd is like a cross between The Secret Garden and Riverdance, complimented by the fantastic voices of Liz Callaway, Brian d'Arcy James, Victoria Clark, Emily Skinner, and many more. A must for any Musical Theatre lover who is constantly seeking the songs that ""no one has yet heard""."
1,Rip off,"What a rip off! It worths $5-$7 at most for the quantity, let along the taste - save your money for something else. I would rather give no star at all."
2,Joseph Karaoke Disc Mediocre At Best,"I was disappointed enough that there are many songs not covered on this disc, but that would have been acceptable if the songs that were covered were of good quality. The background instrumentals were decent, but several of the songs were chopped a bit, leaving out instrumental dance breaks or even entire verses of music. The biggest downfall, however, was the caliber of the background vocals on the karaoke disc. I myself would never use any of the tracks with vocal backgrounds on this disc professionally because they were actually under the pitch. No way will I sing with off-pitch vocals in the background. This disc might be good if you just want it for fun, since some people might not be bothered by that. At least the instrumentals were ok."
1,Garbage - 5 Failures and Counting,"I am a very experienced former contractor. We used on single circuit with 5 lights and three units failed, overheated or flickered. Tested various wattage bulbs in all lights - 40s, 60s and 100s and all three dimmers caused an annoying flicker at less than 50% brightness with all wattage's.Lutron customer service was great and I exchanged a dozen emails with their tech guy trying to sort it out, but to no avail, even after getting two new units direct from Lutron, they were all flawed and flickered.Is it bad design or is my house haunted? I guess I'll never know."
4,Futureistic fade-in fade-out dimmer,The engineers have gone and made a better dimmer. This dimmer has fine incremental adjustment control and obviously a master on off control. It takes a little getting used to because it has a small delay between pressing the on or off switch and it responding with a gradual fade-in or fade-out.
1,a bad product,Installed and does not work. Just found out I cannot return since passed the date. Nothing I can do with such a defect product.
3,Doesn't work with CFLs or LED bulbs,"Incandescent lights are being phased out in the US. As of January 1, 2012 100 watt incandescent bulbs are no longer available. The alternatives are CFL and LED bulbs. It turns out that this switch does not work with either one of these types of bulbs.The product itself looks nice and I like how the screws are hidden behind the faceplate, but only being able to use it with incandescent bulbs is a huge drawback. Returned."
3,I hate the connections!,"This is a beautiful dimmer.it is very nice.I hated the install. The connectors had an option to either loop and tighten or stick the wire in a hole and have it held there in the back.The connection for the hole was too small for normal gauge house wire.The screws did not have a plate where you could easily place the wire inside and then screw it down, it was just a screw-Every time I would get one on, the other would break/fall offThe longest part of installing 16 recessed lights, was getting these damn dimmers to wire up properly."
3,I agree. not an energy saver,"Unless this dimmer uses pulse width modulation to reduce voltage (very unlikely) It is just dumping voltage to a resistor, so you are using the same energy. Just some to light the bulb and some to heat a resistor."
1,"Not durable, DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!","I placed these throughout my house a couple of years ago, over 2000 bucks for light switches and they are JUNK! I thought they were cool the first few weeks, then the trouble started...Every week I would find another one that is broken. You touch them to turn on/off, but your friends and the cleaning people touch them and they are broken. REALLY Lutron?They also get smoking hot if you have the lights dimmed, What?I have been replacing them as they fail with sliding dimmers until I find something else that the manufacturer will stand behind. I paid a fortune for these and the manufacturer won't stand behind them. I avoid Lutron as a rule now..."
2,Too Abstract,"I hoped this book would give me an understanding of semiotics from the point of view of classical and scholastic metaphysics. Certainly John Deely has the learning to do this. But I found this book largely unreadable. Long, long sentences. Clause piled upon clause. No examples. No contact with the world of experience. If he were my student, I would force him to write out, in one page, using short sentences, just what he wanted to say. But alas, he has passed that stage. I haven't found the book I sought, but this is not that book."
2,"So Irrititating, I Couldn't Even Finish It","This book is written from the first person perspective of the author and that ends up being its downfall. If he spent half the time writing about the seals that he spent complaining about his own problems, it might have been readable.If you want to learn more about Paul Watson and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society from an outsider perspective, I'd recommendThe Whale Warriors: The Battle at the Bottom of the World to Save the Planet's Largest Mammals, though I really think Captain Watson tells the story much better himself in his booksSea ShepherdandSeal Wars: Twenty-five Years on the Front Lines with the Harp Seals."
3,Scatterbrained,"I've been reading this book and find the author's whole train of thought to be very scatterbrained, choppy. It seems like one minute, something happens, and then very abruptly, the train of thought changes without warning. If this pattern holds true for the rest of the story, I'm not sure I'll buy another Curtiss Ann Matlock work -- it is wearing me out!"
5,What A Soulful Voice,Solomon Burke is very Soulful&Powerful here.The Voice&Music is Timeless.this is very Essential to Any Fan of Real R-N-B Music.
3,Cry to Me,"I purchased this cd hoping that there would be other familiar songs on it but to no avail there weren't. Maybe I am just too young!But what didn't disappoint was the one song I purchased the cd for and that was the song ""Cry to Me"", which was played in the movie Dirty Dancing. I had to have it and is the only good song,in my opinion, on the cd."
5,Bought it for one song - love the whole thing!,"LOVE the song Cry to me, because it is from Dirty Dancing. It is the one song that does not come on the dirty dancing soundtrack.From the part of the movie where Baby shows up in his room at night and says ""Dance with me"" - ""What here?"" - ""Here"".I was so excited when I got the soundtrack but so disappointed to find out that song was not on the cd, so I searched on youtube for the song not knwoing what it was called, and my husband surprised me with this cd for xmas this year! I have played it over and over and over again! LOVE IT!"
5,Love Solomon Burke's music,I was very saddened to hear of the passing of this music legend. The Very Best of Solomon Burke is my favorite CD of his.RIP Solomon .
4,"after Otis, Solomon","Solomon Burke has more depth, sweetness, sex and soul than anyone around and if this CD does not make you cry, shout out loud and love the one you're with, you're deader than Otis."
5,The book was adapted from the film script,"Not the other way around.This also happened with the novelization of Alien which Foster did. In both cases, Foster did a superb job of taking a science fiction script and making the story believable and functional in the form of a novel.He's a wonderful writer, and if you enjou his work, I expect you'd enjoy this one as well."
3,The book can't capture the suspense of the movie!,"Even in the future, a shotgun is a powerful weapon.On a mining outpost near Jupiter, Marshal O'Niel (Sean Connery) uncovers a deadly drug ring. However, the mining colony is a rough place, and the folk there, including O'Niel, are not exactly model citizens. When professional assassins are sent on the next shuttle to take care of the ""O'Niel problem,"" O'Niel finds out who his real friends are. It's a real, real short list.I've always thought this is a thrilling movie. This book, Outland: The Novelization, tries to capture that excitement, but the film is so much more powerful. I suspect it would be an entertaining book if I hadn't watched themovie version, but I'm stuck forever with the vision of Sean Connery and his shotgun here."
4,Good Series,"I bought this CD for Angela Clemmons.Wanted to replace the LP that was so worn. It's a real shame they didn't offer the 30 second intro that showed her vocal range. Thats the reason I wanted the CD! My org.was worn out from many plays in the DJ booth. Their all classic songs. Their all mostly long vers. but Not the org 12""."
5,Great for organizing you Job Search,"I was not sure how I was going to use this when I ordered it, but it has been GREAT for quickly putting my hands on the cover and follow-up letters for the different companies that I had applied to. Much better than sorting by date; I could organize by companies' names - and it was portable. I didn't have to have computer access since I had a hard copy for each."
3,Hendrix Speaks,This is a good disc eventhough there is no music on it but if you love hendrix then you will love to hear him speaking about himself
5,Blacklight party!,"I used this paper to cover my walls as a base on which to paint fluorescent paint for a Halloween blacklight party. This paper was WELL worth the price! Less than 30 dollars (about as much as I paid for the PAINT!) and I was able to cover the entire room and then some. This paper was extremely durable; it did not rip easily and provided a smooth painting surface. Plus, the roll shipped EXTREMELY early!"
4,Good stuff,"I use this to cover the windows in my warehouse. I was originally going to order mini-blinds but that would set me back about $1000 to cover all the windows. I decided to use this product instead.For my application, even though this product is somewhat thin, you cannot see through it, even with light shining on it from the opposite side. The light shows through the duct tape much more than this paper.Light does come through to some degree as the black paper shows up as opaque in my surveillance cameras, but black in person. But looking from outside in, it does act as a nice privacy screen.It is very easy to cut. I roll out as much as I need, mark and cut with a utility knife. A utility knife is best, since the blades will wear out quickly, cutting over a concrete floor. Using scissors will prove inaccurate and slow."
3,black paper roll,"The shipping of this product was extremely fast and the fact there was no shipping cost was one of the reasons for my purchase. However, the description of the product is misleading. It is described as a ""heavy"" paper, as opposed to some of the medium weights that are available. It is actually a thin, flimsy paper, not even close to durable or heavy. The quality of the paper did not meet my expectation of what I thought I was ordering based on the product description. Also, there was no invoice printout included in the shipment."
1,"Thin, terrible for tempera, feather weight.","We paint a large mural (12' x 40') every year at our high school with tempera paints. We tried a roll of this this year. The paper peels up horribly at the edges, and a second coat of paint creates holes in the paper. Flimsy, deceptively described, and to be avoided at all costs."
5,Perfect,"This is a sturdy, solid paper for bulletin board use. Also, the pre-school staff wanted a different color; this is great for spring, a beautiful green that can be used for different purposes."
2,Too long and heavy,"this is not what I expected, I wanted a shorter reel as far as height goes, it is hard to store and heavy, I hardly use the stuff I wanted the paer to be not so tall."
2,Not good for patterns,"Bought the paper to make garment and accessory patterns with and, while it's low priced for the size and quantity, the paper is very thin. I find it similar to butcher paper which I use for making moc-up patterns with, and I'll be using this for the same purpose. Purchased to make finished, sturdy patterns that will be used many times but it's not suitable for that. Thinner than typical printer paper."
4,Spectra ArtKraft Duo-Finish Paper.,I was very pleased with the weight and the difference of texture on each side. Suitable for a workshop project on glass.
2,bad deal,"It doesn't cover were I live, just of sunset and the 101. Last time I checked it was la. handy for the westside la freeways but not east."
3,Waterline or not Waterline,"Folks,As far as I can determine the Trumpeter 1/700th battleship series is full hull only, no waterline version in the model. Perhaps someone at Amazon can confirm that.(I don't own this particular model.)"
4,For Orgo Review.,"I took the ACS examination and I purchased this book for review. I found it quite helpful. Even though I did not ace the exam, there were many reactions that were easier to recognize because I had reveiwed this book. I felt better prepared and did considerably better than fellow classmates who did not have this resource. As has already been mentioned..this book is not easy to find.I highly recommend this book for review purposes, and I would also keep it in reach for reference."
5,Definitely worth it,"I had a D in ORGO 1, a C in orgo 2, and I got an 85 on the national test thanks to this book. Buy it."
3,Basically valuable as a check,"This thing is valuable as a check to help you verify that you've actually learned something during your ochem studies. It wouldn't really help you improve your weakness or teach you anything, though. Don't stress too much, though. The exam isn't that hard (a lot easier than the exams your prof likely gives you). If you can't get ahold of a copy of this thing, it isn't the end of the world, but if you can, every little bit helps, I suppose."
4,A must have for Orgo,This book is great. I am able to go through and get comprehensive explanations of concepts while attempting to apply them myself.
1,The book is very helpful but this dealer is pretty deceitful,"The book itself it a great tool to prepare for the test. However,the particular book I happened to order had all of the right answers were circled which was extremely annoying. It was very hard to think through the problem to the right answer when the right answer was circled. The last 25 pages were also ripped out so I couldn't review any spectroscopy. I will never order another book from these people awful experience."
5,Reliable Seller!,"I ordered the ACS Organic Chemistry Exam review guide. The item was shipped and received very quickly (less than a week for the whole process)! If you are in need of an ACS book to study for finals, then this is the seller for you!! Thanks!!"
1,Seller is a JERK,"I purchased a ACS book for my final. I email her 7x times for 5 days with every note that I will have final next week. I paid for priority mail. Never got a response. After 6 days, I got noticed that item is OUT OF STOCK. I went back to amazon and the same seller is selling for $2 more than what I paid for. What a jerk. She screwed up my final. I could have paid $2 more to get the book for my final. She is a JERK. Don't buy anything from her."
5,Old Fan,I used to see Ted on Venice Beach and you could hear and feel his soul from 2 blocks away. He could melt a chrome heart.Venice Beach is not the same without him.
3,READ!!!!,"This is a crappy look alike of the XM8 spring rifle. Dont pay more than $10 for it. It's listed here for $50. It shoots only about 30 feet, and it loads 2 bbs at a time. It's made from cheap plastic, and the scope is just a plastic tube. Be careful of cheap look alike guns."
2,Great value...typical HP keyboard problem,"This is a lot of computer for the money. Fast processor, built-in bluetooth, big hard drive, Lightscribe (which is cool).Having said that...Mine is one week old and already having keyboard problems. This is a very old story with HP. I had an HP years ago and the keyboard eventually reached the point where many of the keys would not work. Owners have complained about it for years. (Check the numerous notebook forums.)Calling tech support is useless. You reach someone in India who speaks little English and can only recite from a script.At $1,400+ for this machine, avoid it. Try Toshiba, Sony or Fujitsu. A few more bucks, but it will have a keyboard that works. HP has had years to fix this and hasn't.No more HP's for me."
5,Love Story is essential,"For those unfamiliar with this band, Love was Jim Morrison's favorite band and a favorite of others such as Robert Plant, Billy Bragg, Ted Nugent and countless others. Jimi Hendrix even recorded with them. The lead singer, Arthur Lee, looks like Jimi. The music sounds like a cross between the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, the Byrds and the Moody Blues. This 2 cd set remasters essential recordings putting the cuts from the first 2 cds in the original mono which brings out the guitar and bass better giving these cuts a stronger, richer sound. The entire Forever Changes cd is included. I just wish it was a 5 disc or more set because Love's music is so essential no music should be left out."
5,perhaps america's greatest band of the sixties,"i cant even begin to say how incredible a songwriter arthur lee was, never mind his other abilities, and let's not forget mclean's talent either. while not every single song that love created is a masterpiece ( i.e.revelation , much of false start,parts of out here)i still believe this is a great great compilation potentially superseded only by a box set of EVERYTHING ever recorded by love. i agree that love and moby grape were the preminent u.s. bands of the era."
5,Legendary lost band is fondly remembered.,"Relegating Love to one-hit-wonder status by way of My Little Red Book would be a serious mistake for any fan of '60s rock music. Evolving from garage-band punks to qsychedelic musical visionaries in the short span of just three albums, the band deserves another listen. This superb collection includes the entire Forever Changes album, their wonderous, musically adventurous third album from '67, digitally remastered no less. Anyone unfamiliar with this lost classic from the Summer of Love is missing out on an integral musical artifact from that golden era. The original lineup ultimately suffered tragic endings (drugs, death, prison, etc.), most recently with the untimely death of founding member Bryan Maclain (who had just released a long-awaited CD of Love-era demos). Get this collection for the remastered Forever Changes album alone, and you'll get your money's worth. And then some."
3,"get real, phonies!","this stuff is ok, but really is pretty laughable. people who say love was one of the best bands of the era are either too stoned or are phony geeks who just want to be better than everyone else for liking obscure stuff. this is like someone spoofing 60's psych... check out skip spence, mutantes, or beefheart for real good obscure 60's music..."
4,thought provoking,"This is a thinking game. It's like ""dots"" and ""dominoes"". My kids like it very much."
1,"Wow... this is really, really, terrible.","I, too, was exposed to this band while working for my college radio station. I can't even quite figure out what this band is trying to do with their music. The lyrics are horribly contrived, the instrumentation sounds like bad, rip-off seventies rock, and the vocalists are just plain bad. Avoid this CD if you can!"
3,stompin',"This is the harshest version of the Outgrabe sound. Even their latest work (like their cover of Bullet the Blue Sky) is rockin' without being angry. For me, the jewel is ""We Like Angels Never Weep."" I like all their versions, but this one is plucked and punchy, while still beign achingly sad. I like that.""Love in the Time of War"" is like Romeo and Juliet with guns, and it's hard to find any fault with that. Check this CD out if you want to get battered to death by drums. Otherwise, see their later work."
2,"In Russia, they call this ""post punk""","Truth is, one hardly knows why Outgrabe decided to take this detour into the land of ""bang the drum."" Their first and third CDs are filled with very lyrical and moving songs. This CD simply clouts you about the head and shoulders. My impression is that the die-hand Grabies will like it, but I'm rarely in the mood for this sort of thing myself.Note to previous poster: If you want to know what all this fuss is about, take a listen to their third CD, ""City of God."" That's the one that has all the knickers in a twist."
1,Whaaat?? I laughed out loud when I first heard this...,"...'cuz it sure doesn't stand up to the hype of it's love-struck 5-star reviewers! Yeeeg, did we even listen to the same band??? Hmmm, I won't tarry long, here....The male singer's voice annoys. And it's a real head-scratcher that folks believe the female singer's voice compares to Grace Slick or Stevie Nicks. In terms of range, tone, chops, or originality...t'ain't so.The cliched, mediocre lyrics were surely lifted from some industrious 9th grader's notebook scrawl.I don't give a rat's rear if they make the cover of SPIN. Methinks someone has confused ""fashionable"" with ""talented."""
4,ROCK-POP WITH A STING,"Suzi Quatro had several musical incarnations during the 1970s, from leather-clad proto-punk to more mature pop chanteuse. Her early hits were aggressive three-chord ditties like Can The Can, 48 Crash, Daytona Demon and Devil Gate Drive, all done in her shouting vocal style. Later she actually started singing and had hits with beautiful ballads like If You Can't Give Me Love and She's In Love With You. Her duet with Chris Norman of Smokie, Stumblin' In, is included here, as are interesting covers of classics such as Fever, All Shook Up and Steve Harley's Make Me Smile (Come Up And See Me). In retrospect, Quattro was quite original for her time and very successfully mined a pop-rock vein. Her contribution to the UK music scene in the 1970s was considereable and this album reveals her as a sensitive interpreter of intelligent compositions, in addition to the disposable pop."
4,Suzi was born to run...,"...and rock-n-roll! This is the only CD I know of featuring Quatro's version of Springsteen's ""Born to Run"", and it's worth a few bucks for this song alone. Most of the other selections, good ones mind you, can be found on the proper albums, but at least if you find this cheap you've got one solid rarity. ""Make Me Smile"" is a super-smooth come-on, ""Mama's Boy"" shows off Suzi's sassy side, ""Daytona Demon"" sounds like a cross between Joan Jett and T.Rex, and ""Stumblin' In"" is her buttery duet with Chris Norman(and her only big US single). It's a worthy package despite absolutely no pictures(aside fom the cover)or liner notes. B+"
3,Very small address book okay to carry in wallet or checkbook,I had no idea this address book would be so small when I ordered it. I may make it an item for very few but necessary numbers to carry in my wallet or slip into an evening bag. The spaces are very tiny which is not practical for everyday use.
1,Perhaps 7 years bad luck,"Although the idea of this work is interesting, it falls short in terms of providing an enjoyable and interesting read. Many of the events and characters seem to be too setup and unbelievable. The writer is trying to get into the mind of a master spy, a genius, but seems more like an average kindergarten student attempting to explain the mind of Shakespeare. As a result the characters, dialogue, plot, and pacing aren't capable of conveying the mind of Hanssan. The characters were quite flat and the reader is not able to make an emotional connection with any of them through the whimsical and juvenile writing. There certainly seems to be something missing in this work."
2,A novelisation for mass consumption,"This is simply not a serious piece of work. It tries to be non-fiction while writing it within the style of fiction.It reminded me of those books that come out with a film saying ""Based on the screenplay of the film.""The Bureau and the Mole by David Vise was far better and revealed the same information."
2,I really know what to make of this book.,"Certainly Robert P. Hanssen was a difficult man to understand but the main problem that I have with this book it is impossible to determine whether you are reading real facts or fiction.After reading the book, I am not sure whether it was the excitement or the money that was the major cause.Anyway I was hoping for a study of what Robert P. Hanssen gave away. The effect on security etc. There is little of this."
2,Confusing at best,"I read the book cover to cover. However, I found the mix of fact and fiction too confusing. While reading the book you have no idea whether the particular passage you are reading is fact or fiction. I won't be reading anything else by Schiller."
2,"Fictionalized Non-fiction, and sensationalized at that.","I was blown away by the account of what I read, but only at first. What seemed to be a mesmerizing account of Hanssens's escapades proved to be a categorical hoax. I think less of Schiller and far far less of Norman Mailer after quickly realizing their creative snippets of the double agent's life are a sensationalized sham. It's a shame that both took such liberties in rewriting the facts of all people connected to Hanssen; my sympathy goes to them for the injustices served to them. I'll opt to read a credible book rather than finish this fiasco."
4,Never let the truth get in the way of a good story . . .,"I sympathize with the reviewers disturbed by the fictional aspects of this supposed nonfiction story, but I still enjoyed it more than the other books on Hanssen. For the facts, read the New York Times. For an interesting (somewhat trashy) true-crime book, read this."
5,The light source,Super easy to use and significantly extends your flash photo distance over in-camera flashes. Versatile flash direction accommodates multiple scenarios and moods.
5,A Great Flash Unit,"I upgraded to the 580 from my original 420 and am pleased that I did so. The 580 has all the head-swivel options that I need and serves as an excellent master over the slave 420. It seems to mow through batteries fairly quickly, so I always have to keep plenty on-hand, but that's to be expected when you are using it as a flash and master unit. The Speedlights all seem to be well designed and fit securely on my Canon EOS digital cameras, so I feel confident shooting vertically, as well as horizontally, with the flash unit attached."
2,Didn't meet expectation,This flash fell short of my expectation most of the time I have to manually set the zoom distance doesn't seem to work on my canon xt that I have. For the price wasn't worth it with and auto focus camera I expected this to interact more with the camera
5,I LOVE you guys!,"Thank you sooooooo much! This was the BEST service I got from all my purchases from Amazon! Thank you upgrading my shipping, that was a nice touch! It was so nice of you guys! And you actually told the truth when you said it was new! Thanks! And I look forward to doing more business with you guys! Later!"
5,perfect fit for my 20d!,"got this flash as a gift to add to my ""bag of photography goodies"" I can't say enough great things about it. I've noticed significant improvements in the color and lighting in all my photos when I use this flash. I recommend getting a diffuser like the Sto-Fen Omni-Bounce. The diffuser makes the light softer, and helps to fill in the shadows. I highly recommend the 580ex"
5,Expensive but worth it,"The 580EX is expensive you won't have a choice if you are using a Digital Rebel XT. The old 420EX and 380EX just didn't give the correct exposure (too dark). The flashes just didn't talked to the Digital Rebel XT properly and bounce ceiling shot wasn't strong enough.Since buying this flash, 90% of the flash pics are properly exposure. Fewer missed shots (faster cycling). Considering the flash will last 10 years or longer, it is a worthwhile investment."
4,Speedlite review,"This is a great flash - but sometimes it's a little tempermental. It doesn't always like to do what you tell it, but if you press the button enough it will do what you want."
2,too complicated,I wanted a flash for my 20D so I bought this one. I put it on my camera and tested it. I saw no difference between the pictures I took with this flash and the pictures that I took with the built in flash. It adds a lot of weight to the camera and makes it difficult to hold. I just don't see the benefit. It is too complicated to figure out so I am sending it back.
5,Love it!,"I had a 420 EX that quit working, so I decided to upgrade to the 580. I have a single studio light and I wanted to be able to manually set the flash. I find it very easy to manually set this flash, it did require once through the manual, but it's very logically laid out and mates well with my 20D."
3,Not his best effort,"Although I was very impressed with his other two books (on plastic laminate countertops and cabinet refacing), this book really disappointed me. Kimball seemed to be trying to drum up business for contractors rather than providing a resource for professionals and DIYers who want to actually learn how to do the job."
4,just right,bought this to install lock sets it is very durable and just the rightr size I would recomend this product
1,I'm not looking over this 4 leaf Clover...,"BORING male singers sound like thier trying to impersinate a female group. Why would men want to sound feminine like women/ This Clovers cd is LAME! I don't know why anyone would llok over these four leaf clovers. If this cd were a pizza it would be a Anchove pizza with extra Anchoves. Go buy an Andrews sisters cd if you want to hear girls harmonizing, but don't buy a Clovers cd!!! eeeewww They should rename it the very worst of the Clovers"
3,Everyday Genius,"As a student, I was assigned this reading. I found the latter half of the book to be the most useful. However, I thought that the first eleven chapters could have been revised to approximately three chapters. The most impressive part of this book is Kline's examples of his learning philosophies. These examples include games, activities, and exercises that are applicable in the home and classroom. Overall this read was intelligent and insightful. Kline has some truly amazing ideas."
5,Great for animals and people too,"A friend of ours suggested that my husband use it when he pulled his back, he gave a small bit to my husband and he tried it, his pain was gone right away. Who knew. I ordered another bottle and now I have it on hand, in case we get anymore muscle pulls or my arthritis acts up. Easy to use and works quickly."
1,Did not reduce my knee pain.,A friend told me her husband got relief from knee pain with Bigeioil.I tried it for several weeks. I got no relief and now will have joint replacement surgery.Ted
3,too fast,"This dvd has six workout days and each day runs from 6 min to 20 min. On some days the instructor is going extremely too fast, and someone at beginners level is not able to keep up with the pace."
1,We can make a horror movie out of it..,"A book with very little peaceful commandments and a lot more violent stuff. The author of original book looks like a maniac suffering from autism who is a sadist, whose whole purpose in life is torture people in violent fire. He significantly lack scientific knowledge, and have no idea about how fractions in mathematics works. He doesn't know that earth is not flat, and sun doesn't revolve around earth and that there was no such guy as Zulqarnain who built an enormous wall to trap trillions of people. He copied embryology from Aristotle and Galen and thinks that he created the entire universe. He not only copied Aristotle's accuracies about embryology but its inaccuracies."
1,Poor paper quality,"I love this interpretation/translation. But this printing has such poor paper, like newsprint. So I was disappointed. Romance novels are printed on better paper.Only consolation is it being read able.Got it for a friend, but haven't given it, still mulling over it being presentable."
1,Not so much a translation as an apology,"I wrote a detailed review many moons ago about how this edition is not so much a translation as a rewriting. Ali fails to take this opportunity to address the well-known problems such as the grammatical and historical errors, and instead adds words throughout the text to make it more palatable to Western readers, in many places changing the meaning completely. In fact this distortion of the text should be considered blasphemy, if not for the fact that some adherents consider deception to be an acceptable means of advancing the cause.The fact that all reviews for this item seem to have been quietly removed perhaps speaks volumes about the plain meaning of its unadorned teachings, discomfort with what Ali has done, or the power of its adherents to silence doubts."
4,Good translation,"An Egyptian Christian missionary who has spent his life ministering to Muslims and studying Islam explained that this is the best English translation available. Many translations put the Quran into Western-acceptable terms; this version does not. If you want to read what Arabs read, this is probably the closest you will get."
3,for the tough guy,"Let me put it this way: if you show up at band camp with a strawberries and cream colored mouthpiece, you'd better kick a tuba player's arse the first day. The sooner the better."
1,Yet another literary hoax,"Once again, a flavor-of-the-month author has come along with the latest ""historical evidence"" of a book that does not exist. The Necronomicon is the literary invention of H.P. Lovecraft, nothing more. Lovecraft invented the book as well as its history for his pulp horror stories (which are quite good, incidentally). Please, skip this mish-mash and read Lovecraft instead."
5,Reality with a Hilarious Twist,"This book was a fun read. It starts out with Courtney who is a vegetarian and works at Truth or Dairy where they sell smoothies and wheatgrass drinks, etc. getting dumped by her long-time boyfriend, Dave. Dave thinks they need to be apart when he goes to college.So Courtney makes a pledge. No boys all senior year. Seems easy enough at the time considering she's in a slight depression. But what happens when Grant Superior comes around? What about other guys like the Tom? Can she keep her pledge?It doesn't end just there though. Many fun characters throughout the book who you can't help to remember make this diary type form book one you will remember."
4,Truth or Dairy,"Truth or Dairy is the journal of a girl named Courtney Von Dargen Smith. She is a normal girl living a happy life. She is entering her senior year of highschool. She works at Truth of Dairy, the local hip cafe with her best friend Beth. Her boyfriend is heading on to college and tells Courtney that he would like to be free and clear. Courtney just can't seem to get him out of her mind. She is so angry and sad that she decides to make an anti-guy plan for senior year. Then she becomes close with her ex-boyfriend's friend. She struggles to keep her anti-guy pact.Truth of Dairy is a good book and it is fun to read. Courtney goes through a lot of typical teen situations and it is fun to read about how she describes time in her diary. This book keeps your interest and you can't put it down. This book is more geared toward teenage girls. I recommend this book if you like a book with a little romance and a lot of excitment."
3,Truth? You asked for it....,"The truth is that though I love the Alice series and halfway was amused by the writings of Louise Rennison on Georgia Nicolson, Truth or Dairy had all the flavor to me of a glass of wheatgrass juice. Courtney is a lame character whom even ""the Tom"" (the student council president who has tried to sleep with just about every girl in his class) refuses to be romantically interested. She works at a juice and ice cream shop by the name of Truth and Dairy, makes vague attempts at being a vegetarian, and refuses to go out with a guy for the school year.There are some bright moments of reprieve in the book, such as when she admits how lame of a person she is in her diary and when her friends liven up the diary by adding their own entries. The supporting cast of characters: her brother Bryan, her friends Beth and Jane, nice guy Grant Superior, and others add just enough saving grace to keep from wanting to return this concoction of words for a refund.Crazy James"
4,I really enjoyed this book!,"This book is about a girl named Courtney who has some boy troubles. Well, I'm sure you've read about a girl who's had boy troubles, but the author, Catherine Clark, inserts fresh air into this very funny novel. Courtney is determined not to go on a date with another boy for the rest of the school year, when her beloved boyfriend breaks up with her just before school starts. Because of this decision, the relationship with a few guy friends and girl friends become endangered, and she is forced to make the ultimate decision. Courtney learns how to stay true with all her relationships, and along the way, strengthens her bond with her mother, brother, father, stepmom, stepsister, and her stepsister's daughter. She learns to stay true to her friends and family, and matures greatly by the end of the book. This book is a funny yet powerful novel."
3,"A little pointless, but, why should it have a point...","So, now I've read ""Truth or Dairy"" and find myself none the better but none the worse either for this read. It's not always entirely easy to follow because it is written in diary form, I mean really DIARY form, just as disjointed and random as a real diary would be but it was kind of fun that way y'know you really felt like you are the naughty little sister who had stolen your big sisters diary, not just you sitting there reading a book `cause you're bored... It was funny sometimes and just plain frustrating other times, where you find yourself tearing out you're hair thinking ""my god she's soooo stupid, no one in their right mind would do that!"" but it was enjoyable, if a little pointless..."
3,"Good, easy read","This book is a typical teen novel with a few slight twists and quirky differences. While it's not the best book ever written, it is humorous and certainly enjoyable, especially if you're looking for something light to breeze through. The characters can be easily compared to people you probably know/knew in high school and the situations are feasible, which makes the book seem realistic and actually like the diary it is supposed to be. I wouldn't recommend this if you're looking for something deep and teen-angsty, but if you just want a lighthearted, feel-good book that will make you chuckle and leave you smiling, you should pick this one up."
4,Hilarious and Realistic = One cool read,"Courtney Van Draagen Smith is the charming character of Catherine Clark's hilarious and awesome book Truth or Dairy. Her witty diary and opinions are what any teen (coming from one) can definitely realte to. Just as her long-time boyfriend Dave breaks up with her when he goes off to college, she pledges that she's going to take a year off from boys, but a boy-free year, as many of us will find is sometimes one of the most difficult things to acheive. Here is a hilarious book that is light, funny, and definitely worth putting down whatever your doing to read. This book can get dragging between major events--still worth every moment though. I'd most certainly buy it!..."
2,boring,this book was boring and had no point to it. the author obviously has no clue how teenagers act or think today and her level of writing is nowhere near where it should be this book was a waste of time and the author needs to get a clue
1,Possibly the most overrated band of their era,"Face it, America, these guys are not all that good. If I never have to hear them screech their way through another song it will be too soon."
3,Terrific but Kindle Version is Flawed,"Fascinating book, engrossing story. Highly recommended for sci-lovers & lay readers alike. HOWEVER, I bought the Kindle version & was disappointed to find that all of the photos are missing! The captions are there, but no photos display. Bummer. (hey Amazon, what gives??)"
4,"Hand Wash Only, Bake using minimum time...","I received this as a gift and I have to say that I love the brownies that have come out of it. It takes a little longer to spread the batter than a traditional pan, but it's not that difficult,... just work your way around using a spatula to push the batter out of the bowl into the pan, then pick up the pan and give it a couple of shakes to spread the batter to the edges. I generally use boxed brownie mixes and bake according to the minimum time, then allow it to sit for several minutes so that the edges harden while it cools. I use a bit of Crisco around the edges and the whole thing can pop out if you want to flip the pan.The only think I really don't like is that it is ""hand wash only"". I think a couple of the 1-star reviewers discovered why. In any case, hand wash is a pain compared to a traditional pan because you have so many more crevices to clean out. I'd give them 5 stars if they improve the coating so that it's safe for the dishwasher."
5,Love the Baker's Edge Pan!!,"I love this pan. No longer do I have to fight for the corners and edges. From now on, all my brownies will be made in this pan.I've also used it to make other types of cookie bars.Looking forward to trying out the lasagna pan too!Definite must have for your kitchen!!"
5,Best Brownie Pan Ever,"This pan makes the best brownies ever, everybody loves the edges. The only thing that would make this pan better is if it was easier to clean, but that doesn't seem possible with all the right angles."
5,Fantastic wonder pan adverts family brownie war,"I have been baking the same brownie recipe for over 30 years and have always had the singular problem of not enough corner pieces for everyone to get a corner. I was given this pan as a birthday gift and immediately used my standard brownie recipe in the pan and was amazed at how the recipe improved within the pan -- not just because everyone could now get an edge piece either: the consistency is one that cannot be baked in a standard 9x13 -- just heaven! Really quality bakeware, a joy to have!"
4,"Nice pan, but no fitted lid.","What do you get a Mom that has everything? That was my challenge, so I tried this thinking it would be something unique to add to her kitchen collection. It didn't disappoint as she really liked it and complimented it's quality and the cooking results. The one thing she said that would improve it, would be if I could find a lid for it so she could easily transport brownies to people/events. Thus far, I haven't been able to find one. Other than lacking a lid, she thinks it's great."
5,Amazing Pan,"I am very pleased with the product. It is a very heavy duty cast aluminum, bakes like a dream, and is very easy to clean. If you like the edge pieces on brownies, this is the pan you want to bake in."
3,wonderful idea,"great idea.. but, hard to get the brownies out of the pan.. I recommend getting the spatulas that go with it :)"
4,Fun for those that love the edges!,"I just received the Baker's Edge Nonstick Edge Brownie Pan as a gift for my father-in-law as he loves the brownies with corners and edges. But then I thought that I should also make a batch for him to have right away. Oh wait, maybe I should make a practice batch. I know, I'm bad!I liked that a regular brownie mix fit perfect, but that they also provided some recipes. It had a non-stick coating and it didn't stick. The spatula was a nice extra.Overall, it was neat. It was a little expensive for a pan, since the pans probably aren't mass produced. It seems to be a good, heavy aluminum pan. It was a gift and I would have spent that much anyway on something that he probably won't be this excited out.For those that love the edges on brownies, this is a good pan for you!"
1,"If you love to bake, then you will HATE THIS PAN!!!","The Seller for this item was outstanding & would buy from them again, but this pan is A NIGHT MARE TO USE. DO NOT BUY IF YOU LOVE TO BAKE BROWNIES, as it is terrible to get the mix into and out of it. Very poor design, except for the excellant lifting handles on the side. I was very disappointed in this pan."
2,Consider this..,"I thought this would be a great investment for my kids and family, we are always fighting over who gets the delicious gooey brownies on the inside over the stale crunchy brick like brownies on the edges. I figured if no one can agree to share we might as well not have any gooey ones at all. SO I bought this thinking Im the best Dad in the world. My kids refuse to talk to me and my wife is threatening a divorce.This was the last thing I needed in my life right now. Im very disappointed with this product."
1,Why all the edges???,"I gave this product a shot after a particularly opinionated and cultured (He's been to Europe, so you know he's legit) co-worker insisted I try this. In short, I very much dislike it. Everyone knows that the very best part of the brownie is the middle, and this pan all but eliminates this. After baking, there was approximately 6.4 cubic inches of actual edible brownie. Very wasteful.Quite frankly I am disappointed with this product and anyone who thinks an 'all edge' brownie is preferable to the warm, delicious center."
4,Like crunchy brownies? Look no further..,What isn't apparent online: This bakware is heavy duty. It's also nonstick (great for brownies)which means that it is not dishwasher safe. The channels are somewhat narrow and conventional spatulas don't fit in them but this item comes with it's own little black spatula that is narrow enough to go in the channels! Works exactly as advertised. Make sure to read the instructions carefully because the first brownies cooked quite fast and were a little too crunchy. Instruction manual comes with brownie recipes but the pan is designed to accomodate store-bought brownie mixes too.Overall great product if you like crunchy brownies and are willing to wash this baby by hand. I gave it 4 stars because it seemed a little overpriced.
5,Best Brownies Ever,The crispy edges are my family's favorite part of the brownie so this pan is perfect for us. I cannot think of any negatives for this product and I would definitely recommend it to a friend.
4,Baker's Edge Nonstick Edge Brownie Pan,Used for the first time and it was better then I expected. The brownies came out of the pan with ease and did not burn. The amount of corners was great there wasn't any fighting over them. The pan washed well. The only complaint is that it was not cheap but then again it was $5.00 cheaper then The Sky Mall and I also had free shipping so I saved at least $10.00 by buying it through Amazon.
5,Awesome,"I saw this on Oprah as one of her ""favorite things"" and mentioned to my daughter. A wonderful surprise when I received it for Christmas. This is awesome if you like all your brownies with an edge. Very, very easy clean-up. I even baked a small meatloaf and it turned out great! You can't go wrong with this one. Next hint will be for the bigger pan."
5,Edge Brownie Pan,Pan is made of heavy duty metal and cooks brownie's consistently throughout. We are very pleased with the product and especially pleased to support a fellow Ball State alumni!
5,Buy It For Your Wife!,"My wife loves to bake brownies so I bought this for her as a Christmas present. She absolutely loves it. In fact, I love it too, because it makes for some incredible brownies. Without a doubt the best we've ever eaten. I was a little concerned about the price, but as other reviewers have stated, it's quality bakeware and well worth it. If you don't like chewy edges, then move along, but otherwise this belongs in every brownie lover's kitchen."
4,Worth it - even if you have to wash by hand,"My son saw this pan advertised in an in-flight magazine and mentioned it to the family while home from college. Everyone, especially my wife, was excited (I was excited because they were - I prefer the soft center cuts). I searched for it on the internet and, of course, Amazon was selling it for much less. My son purchased it as a Christmas present for his mother. She was delighted and it works as a advertised, producing perfect brownies with edge cuts in every bite. Everybody is happy, but me, as I am just not an edge man. But I am happy because everybody else is and because I'm more healthy for eating fewer brownies. One product negative; my wife says it is not dishwasher safe and so I'll be washing it by hand."
5,Great Brownie Pan,"This product works perfectly. It bakes the brownies all the way through and there wasn't a problem filling all the curves, as a few of the other reviews have said. The brownies turned out delicious!"
5,Just joining in the fray,I saw all the positive reviews of this item and thought I would add my own. For over a year now it has produced consistent results. My family loves brownie edges and this produces wonderfully. Thumbs up from me.
5,Can't Stop With Just One!!,"I can't believe that we can eat an entire pan of brownies in one evening, but thanks to this incredible pan, we DO! It bakes evenly and the brownie mix tastes like an entirely different mix than ever before. Why waste 1/2 a pan of brownies without edges when each and every piece can be perfectly edged on TWO sides! My gosh, somebody stop me now!!!"
5,It's everything they said it was.,"This brownie pan is the everything it was advertised as. It is a heavy pan that should hold up for years. It works great with cakes too. I have tried it with muffin recipes with good results also. It cooks faster than my basic brownie /cake pan so, stay near the oven. The cooking is more even, there is not the issue with over cooked edges and uncooked middles. I like a lot of edges and you can cut the brownies and cake to smaller sizes. (this is important when you have teenagers or dieters) I would buy it again. I definitely will be giving some as gifts to friends that like to bake. It is versatile and very easy to clean."
3,Good not Best,"This pan is OK, but it just doesn't cook brownies as good as a glass pan. As IDEAL set up with be the exact same pan using glass!"
5,Ingenious Idea & Well-Made Product,This pan is very sturdy & well-made and turns out brownies to perfection - my husband said they were the best I've ever made. It cleans up easily and is well-worth the money.
5,very well-made sturdy nonstick edge baking pan,"We received the order very quick, even though I selected STANDARD shipping. It came already after a couple of days. The pan is very sturdy and very well made. I can recommend this product highly, especially if you have people in your family who love to eat the edges ... :-)"
4,Language is a Prison,"I read this in college while studying semiotics and surrealism, yet the message of Foucault should not be relegated to the exotic and extreme ""isms"" of academia. I found ""Pipe"" to be a marvelous and playful illustration of the tryanny of language and the Orwellian control of thought which follows. Readers of Postmodern thought, Zen, Marxism, Film Theory, Psychoanlysis, and Modern Art will find moments of illumination throughout."
3,Complicated,"Michel Foucault is a great philosopher, but his interpretation of Rene Magritte's works, most specifically, 'This is not a pipe.' is not for the beginning reader.The only way to really sum up what this book is about is one word: treacle. For the philosopher or the art afficiando, this book is a godsend. He gives you everything you could possibly want to know; his essays incorporate others' works as well, and all of the pictures are nicely arranged in the back.However, for those looking for a quick read, something that caught their eye, or are fans of Margitte, don't buy this book. It over analyzes the artwork, and thus ruins a brilliant piece of art by delivering a mollycoddled interpretation.Just my opinion, hope I can be of some help."
5,Mancini lives on,"As Mancini was a jazz lover both he and I share that. His music from back in the 60s was more famous for musical / movie scores. But , he did TV show music as Peter Gun and Mr Lucky. This treatment - Mr Lucky goes latin was among his best stuff. Anytime I see his work in vinyl I make it a point to pick it up. His B3 player did among the very best organ work of any band / orchestra leader I knew of. If you love jazz, this album should be in your collection. VINYL !! Blue Mantilla ( blue scarve or shawl ) is one great tune. Along with Lujon.S"
1,Poor scan quality,High-resolution scans (above 600 dpi) are corrupted by a jagged-edge pattern. Scans of ordinary photos are unattractive. Scans containing fine lines and other fine details may be unusable.
2,"Ok, But Paper jams","I can never leave this printer alone when faxing with the feeder, or printing. Jams on both ends, so much I wanted to pitch this thing out of the window! Has suddenly decided not to scan anymore manually. I have to set it up to scan now from the computer for it to work. I have seen some great print quality from hp, and am considering a move today!"
1,copyier could not last for more than SIX months,"after using the X7170 Lexmark copier for 5 months it started indicating empty ink cartridge on newly installed ones, it also faild to allighn the printing head,( the new cartridges were from ""Office Depot"" and ""Staples""."
1,Second Hand falls off within 4 weeks,"Ordered this for a Christmas present for a family member. After about 4 weeks of normal use, the second hand completely fell off the face of the watch. In the process of contacting manufacturer for our options."
5,"Cool & Relax, Jon B gives you Pleasures U Like Everyday !","I'm a huge Jon B fan since '95 and this album is off the heezie !!! The music industry needs to recognize the talent of that great musician. I'v been waitin' for so long a new duet with Kenny ""Babyface"" Edmonds and this track 'What I like About You' is my favorite ! But Also 'Lately', 'Multiple', 'One More Chance' & Part 2 feat. the late 2Pac ! A must have for real music lovers !-Nabster-"
4,Ok......but doest not compare to 1997's Cool Relax,"I was shocked that this album was not advertised in any comercials. When I first heard of this album, I was reading a Vibe magazine. I give this CD four stars because:1. I am a huge, huge Jon B. fan2. I have all of his CD's3. Good talented, clean artistI must say that I was slightly (just a bit slightly) disappointed when I heard this album. The songs are great, but I was hoping for more slow ballads. My favorite cut on this CD is definately Before It's Gone. This is how I rate my Jon B. CD's: (Pleasures U Like is tied with Bonafide)3. Stronger Everyday2. Pleasures U Like2. Bonafide1. Cool Relax"
5,' johnny's back and mo' betta ',"this cd is a natural progression of a man that's ""getting stronger everyday"". Jon b seems to have more freedom on thisalbum and it shows.. the music has an smooth flow to it, one ofmy favorites and there are many is ""through the fire"" with scarface nice ridin' music... overall good production, this manknows soul, he needs more support and I hope he gets his just do. ' hang in there mr.jon b. mr. davis from cincinnati, ohio"
1,A good musician gone downhill,"I didn't know Jon B was coming out with another CD but now I see why, this is NOT his best CD. I admit I had to listen to Pleasures You Like a few times to get into it and I ended up loving it; but this CD I didn't want to listen to it again. His music has definately gone downhill. One of his songs sounds like hes been smoking the good stuff. This is a terrible CD, dont waste your money on it. He needs to go back to the studio and reinvent his voice and musical skills. Theres 16 tracks and I cant find one thats my favorite. This CD will not be getting stronger everday."
3,"Not bad, but not what I expected based on the other reviews.","This album is pretty good, ""What in the World"" and ""What I Like About You"" are probably my two favorite tracks. ""Stronger Everyday"" also was pretty good. My biggest issue is that the rap that was in it didn't fit at all and a couple of the tracks have rap verses in them. I like rap, but it just didn't fit where it was placed in this album. I think I was mislead because someone called this Neo-Soul, and I definitely think it's not. I would say this is more R&B easily."
3,"Jon B, back again","This album is different from Jon's other albums and while I enjoy a few tracks from it, I also dislike that Jon had less production on this record. He deserved better promotion as well. With that said, I agree that his voice sounds a little on the weak side but the effort is a worthy one."
1,not happening at all,"Jon B is a Talented Cat,but He has never really been allowed to showcase His own Idenity all the way through on Projects. at first he was Pegged as a Babyface clone&then he has had to roll with various Producers&Rappers on Albums.instead of Possibly being seen&mentioned in the same Breath as Bobby Caldwell,George Michael&Darryl Hall He has to play Industry Politics&be Lumped with a Cat like Justin Timberlake.there isn't one cut that truly hits.Jon B is the kind of cat who doesn't need to be heard hiding behind guest acts."
3,too much like background music,"Jon B's ""comeback"" album is not bad as such; the overall problem is that too much of it is generically samey and lacking in any distinct personality. While some moments stand out from the rest - the lilting verses of Part 2, the percussive, vaguely eastern feel of I'm Right Here or the sensual Az U - too much of it is rendered indistinguishable by dull melodies and vocals that are too far back in the mix to leave any real impression. Unfortunately not even the collection of guest appearances add much to their respective songs. The whole album functions as smooth background music and is all very soothing, but once it's over you're struggling to recall much of it."
4,Stop sleeping on this man,I've been down with Jon B since the cool relax album and been hooked since.His new album is more personal than his others. First off his studio burned down and his wife left. And his problems with his record label. The man can sing slow jams stop sleeping on him i just wish he had a better record label if u went slow jams and music u can kick it with ur girl this album is it.
4,I like them,"Could dissolve a little easier but then might go mushy in the bottle. I just kind of break with my teeth, but don't chew, just break into smaller pieces, than let dissolve under my tongue, which really doesn't take that long. I will stay with this brand."
4,These fit the bill!,I take two of these every morning. They work great and I really like them. I haven't had my levels checked lately so not sure if they are helping yet.
5,A must if you take Acid Reducers,"I've learned that Acid Reducers(Prilosec,Zergerid) depletes you of B-vitamins. So, I take one of these under my tongue about an hour after taking Prlsc. Starts dissolving right away & tastes like cherries. Also, since I've started exercising on a regular, I've got a bit more energy than b4."
5,B-12 Dots - Vitamins,"This is an excellent product! I tried other B-12 products, they could not hold a candle to this one! If you are on the HCG diet, by all means, this IS what you need to take along with it. If I could give it six stars I would!"
2,Not that great,"Too soon to know how effective these are since I'm a month or so out from having my next round of blood work (I have diabetes and was recently found to have a B-12 deficiency). I initially purchased sublingual B-12 at CVS, but it was pretty expensive and since I purchase so many products from Amazon, I thought I'd give these a try. Compared to the more expensive CVS vitamins, these have much poorer flavor but the bigger complaint I have is that they don't dissolve very well. The CVS tablets dissolved quickly, in about 30 seconds. These take several minutes and even then don't dissolve completely. I won't be purchasing these again."
4,B awesome,"I always feel better after taking my B12. And it dessolves in your mouth, so you don't have to gag it down like you do with every other thing. It doesn't taste great, but it's ok. I will buy it again."
4,Dissolving vitamins,"I needed to boost my Vit. B 12 level according to my physician, so after doing some research I decided to use the sublingual preparation. Since I have severe reflux and had surgery for it, I felt it would be better absorbed sublingually rather than going through my stomach. It worked great, had my blood levels back up within 2 months. My only complaint is that the tablets get rather gritty while they're 'dissolving'. Would recommend since it did the job!"
5,A Lifesaver,"This is one of the best pieces of equipment I could have purchased. I have a lot of older 'gadgets,' ones which use 9-point sync cords. My monitor is hooked up to the one port on the computer which would take this cord. This converter hooked me right up (pun intended). I love it!!"
1,Had it only a month and already not worth the plastic its made of....,"Bought mine December 14th, Now won't reliably pass data- using it for a printer/plotter and causes the plotter to stop about half way through a cut or print. Now it is past the return period and I am stuck with it.... FAIL."
5,It works great tried on Win 7 64-bit and Win XP,This is a nice little item and I like that you don't have to use an extension cord with it although a nice one is provided. It works on all the devices I have tried and certainly was cheaper than the dedicated converter sold by my diagnostic scanner manufacturer. It also has a sexy blue LED so what's not to like?
3,"Worked, briefly","This adapter installed automatically under Windows 7 64 bit without any problems. However, it behaves strangely when continuously transferring a lot of data- I think this may have to do with the lack of asynchronicity mentioned in another review.This was tolerable until it stopped being recognized, and started getting very hot to the touch. I unplugged, rebooted, tried again, and had the same result- Windows didn't recognize that a device of any kind had been plugged into the usb port, and the device got very hot.I'm still giving three stars because I think that I either got a lemon, or static discharged it to death."
5,works like a charm,"This is my 2nd adapter for use with my Suunto X6HR watch. My first -- the CP-03 or whatever its called -- worked unreliably at best and then eventually died. This one works like a charm, every time. It doesn't matter which USB port I plug it into."
5,Easy way to attach an older device,"My aviation GPS requires a serial port for updates to its internal map database, but newer PC's lack such a port. While I was skeptical that this adapter would do the job, I found it was trivial to install and it solved my problem quickly and inexpensively. This adapter saved me from having to spend several hundred dollars to replace my GPS with a newer one. I'm happy!"
5,Works for high bandwidth applications,"Cheap alternative to $35-$60 dollar competitor products.This USB Serial Adapter/Converter works for DVDO iScan Duo.Plug in, drivers auto-install, very good."
5,best serial adapter,Over the past 4 -5 years i have tried dozens of serial adapters. This one works perfectly right away. By far the best serial adapter that I have seen. It also has a blue LED display light that tells you it is online.
2,Cool visuals RUINED by sophmoric soundtrack,"I wanted to like this movie. Having recently been pleasantly surprised with ""Azumi"", I was hoping for another little gem.Instead, I am bombed with what sounds like 8th graders practicing CrapMetal in the garage.I could overlook the thin character development, and lack of plotting, as there were some funny moments in the movie.But just when I start to find myself liking this film, here comes the horrid soundtrack to kick that feeling in the groin...If you do buy this, turn on sub-titles and put on your own music.What a waste..."
2,Disappointed,"Love martial arts/fantasy action movies but like Ultimate Versus, I was disappointed by this movie. Gave it away. Waste of money. Should have just watched it through Netflix."
5,I love it so much ;_;,"It's kind of like Versus, except with more plot, less gore, and Tak looks a lot prettier (if that were possible). It is genuinely funny and very fast paced, so that you don't even notice 90 minutes pass by. The action is awesome, as it should be since Tak was the action director. I can't stop watching it over and over, and already infected my friends with it. The only possible problem is the ending, which is very frustrating and offers no resolution, so be prepared."
3,And all that could have been,"Let me start by saying that Versus was awesome. Most people know of Deathtrance through Versus..that being said,THIS IS NOT VERSUS,not even close. It was entertaining to watch and had some awesome characters. I am going to give it 3 stars because,it tried to outdo Versus and failed. However it is a real good movie to watch and yuck it up with friends!"
5,A Beautiful album!,Ihighly recommend this album. Dale Kristien has such a very beautiful voice! I'd give this album 10 stars if I could.
3,Did not work as well for me as others ...,"I tried this product along withAccuflora- Probiotic Acidophilus Dietary Supplement, 240 Capletsduring two separate bouts of having to take anti-biotics in the past year - one for strep and one a very strong anti-biotic they gave me for possible lyme tick bite (I would not take that anti-biotic again!). I am 39 and in great health generally.TheAccuflora- Probiotic Acidophilus Dietary Supplement, 240 Capletsproduct set better in my stomach as well as my bowel both times and got me ""back to normal"" quicker than Ortho Biotic did. As with the Ortho Biotic, the accuflora also does not require refrigeration.I think people's bodies/genetics are all different as well as our environments, diets, illnesses and other prescription medications, so all I can relay is my personal experiences - your mileage may vary :)"
4,Best price I found anywhere!,"When I purchased these Ortho Biotics they were $38.95 from this site then, a week later I sent the same link to a friend and the price was $46.95. However I usually pay $55.00 from my doctor's office. So its still better online than driving to the doctor's office."
3,Didn't Tell a difference,"I bought these because I was going to have surgery and the doctor reccommended that I use them, but I didn't feel any better using them during my recovery or after. The supplier was very good at getting them to me in a timely matter."
5,"Best Probiotic I've Used. GLUTEN AND CORN FREE, too.","I've had issues with other probiotics, but not with Ortho Biotic. My doctor recommended it, and I am very happy with it. I am prone to intestinal yeast and bacterial infections, and Ortho Biotic has helped me considerably.I am also highly gluten-intolerant and, as stated on the label, Ortho Biotic is "". . . formulated to be free of allergens derived from gluten, corn, artificial colors and flavors."""
5,Great stuff!,I started taking this 3 months ago and it has been amazing. I had been feeling very run down & tired and had developed intermittent urgent diarrhea. This had happened gradually over time and when I mentioned it to my accupunturist she put me on this - 2 capsules daily. Within a month I was feeling a lot better. I tried going to one capsule daily after 2 months but had to go back to 2 a day. I have a lot more energy and the diarrhea is completely gone. I'm going to keep taking this long term - it's expensive but worth every penny. I highly recommend it.
1,Hideous! It's not even performed CORRECTLY!,"For crying out loud! Not only does this third rate amateur use a synthesizer to commit his evil crime against Mozart, but he can't even play the notes correctly! Thankfully, I didn't waste my money on this one. Unfortunately, my local library did, so I could witness first hand the butchering of truly fine classical music. Yeah, sure, so baby can fall asleep to it. Kids can also eat junk food too, but that doesn't mean it's good for them. Do your children and yourselves a favor, and go out and get some Mozart that is actually PERFORMED by gifted artists, not chopped and hacked out by a capitalist with a tin ear."
1,Oppenheimer reinvents the bomb,"In truth, this recording deserves negative stars. It might be the worst interpretation I've ever heard of Mozart. You will not be doing your baby any favors by playing it for him or her before bedtime. It is difficult to ruin Mozart, but Max Oppenheimer does a good job by plunking it out on synthesizer and performing way under tempo."
1,Buy the real thing - not this CD,"I have a 3-yr-old autistic son who loves classical music. This CD is not real music - it's simulated. The description indicates various artists - there is only one. The only reason it rates 1 star is that it's Mozart. My advice would be to buy a CD with orchestra, violin or piano!"
4,Pretty Good...,"I've brushed up on H.H. Holmes' profile before (not sure where, but I have his information in my brain somehow) so this documentary inevitably intrigued me.It's pretty good, not all that. Not very gruesome, so it's bearable. I found it boring at times because of the lack of gore and because the guy who narrates the film is extremely monotone and snooze worthy...but overall it was a very informative chunk of history. I liked it although it seemed to be pretty much G rated. It's more for history buffs and not gore aficionados, if you know what I mean."
4,I wish it was 2 hrs,"This was full of information. I rented this after having read The Devil In the White City and was hungry for more details about H.H. Holmes and this DVD did fill me in. However, it is almost impossible to adequately do so in such a short amount of time.More details about finding the Pitezel girls in Canada, the condition of the bodies, etc. since they didn't explain it like they did in one of the books I read which made me despise him even more that he could do that.I know this is probably ridiculous to ask but a computer generated image of what the castle looked like from the inside to get a better idea of the horrors within.I know I am sounding like a ghoul, but it is such a unique case. In any event, it was nicely done and worth watching again and again."
4,I never heard of this killer.,"Serial killers are actually households names in the United States, but I have never heard of H.H. Holmes until I ran into this DVD. This is a one of kind murderer; frightening in the fact of how intelligent and calculating he was. Many of the things he did will shock a lot of people in this desensitized age. The documentary was produced on a low-budget, but it is still a fascinating watch."
2,Well researched but poor production values,"Given the material there is to work with this could and should have been a great doc. But I just couldn't get past the fairly amateurish production values, the bad unnecessary reenactments, clumsy story telling and the redundant information. Also it seems the filmmaker could have reached out to more than the three experts he interviewed, one of which seemed off puttingly enthusiastic. But if you're more interested in the story of H.H. Holmes than watching a good film, it might be worth your while."
2,Meh...,"Learning about HHH was interesting, but the film itself is sub-par. The narrative isn't that great, the footage is repetitive and lackluster (you'll spend about ten minutes watching red travel lines on a map without any explanations for what's going on from trip to trip, etc.)."
2,HH Holmes documentary,"I found this video a little boring and repetitious. It does present a wealth of information about the serial killer and his case. I can see this video as something a viewer might watch on the Arts and Entertainment network one time, not a DVD to purchase."
4,The Devil Sans the White City,"For those who've read Erik Larson's ""The Devil in the White City"" and become subsequently fascinated by America's first serial killer, this is a must. Filmmaker John Borowski does any excellent job telling the story of ""The Devil,"" Holmes. Since it appears that a feature film about Holmes is (finally) in the works, this makes for an excellent stop-gap until its release. Also investigate ""The Strange Case of Dr. H. H. Holmes"" and ""Expo"" as well as ""Devil in the White City"" tours when in Chicago. Enjoy!"
3,Interesting look at one of America's most Cruel Serial Kille,"H.H. Holmes America's First Serial Killer is an interesting informative Documentary about H.H. Holmes life, crimes and atrocities he commited. This is one of the most cruel killers ive ever seen because he was evil in every aspect of his life. It dosent matter what it was, from swindling to murder. He is a very cold calculating character,not to mention he was brilliant. He built his own chamber of horrors with secret rooms, passageways and acid vats. He lured strangers and friends alike to his chamber of horrors so he could kill them and sell their bodies to mortuaries and sell their bones for profit. He wasnt your typical serial killer - he completed college and recieved degrees and took advantage of everyone in his life for his sick greed and pleasure. Truly a monster. I think the story could have been more interestingly told but overall its pretty good if you want to learn more about H.H. Holmes. 3.5 stars."
3,ORDINARY DOCUMENTARY ABOUT EXTRAORDINARY ARCHFIEND,"He was born Herman Mudgett, but he's know as the diabolical archfiend H. H. HOLMES: AMERICA'S FIRST SERIAL KILLER.This depraved doctor was a bigamist, swindler, horse thief and all round psychopath who built a castle like house in Chicago and lured visitors of the 1893 Chicago World's fair to their death.He soaked the bodies in vats of acid and sold their skeletons to medical schools.This somewhat unimaginative documentary recounts the life and times of this inhuman beast. The recreations are lame but the eerie narration by Tony Jay is superb. Extras include outtakes, making of, posters etc. For more on Holmes, see Erik Larson's book ""The Devil in the White City."""
3,Not Bad but There's Better,"After reading ""The Devil in the White City"" I was exceptionally interested in learning more about ""America's first serial killer."" Unfortunately, this documentary failed to provide any additional insight. I found this documentary to be, at best, a cursory overview. It left out important details surrounding his schemes, how truly manipulative he was, and important events surrounding his arrest, regarding the arresting officers relentless search. Its running time of just over 1 hr. should have tipped me off, but I digress. Everything in this documentary can be easily learned via Wikipedia or basic google search. Indeed, a better alternative is to read the aforementioned book, which goes even deeper into the mind of H.H. Holmes, his many victims, and what Chicago was like during the late 1800's."
3,HH Holmes,"I enjoyed this Video, but I thought it skimmed over alot of points and events. The Beast of Chicago is a better version of this story."
2,average,Kind of disappointed after seeing his A. Fish documentary. Not on same level. It was ok though. I leave it up to the people reading it's synopsis to decide for them selves
5,Great Computer,Easy set up and directions and great functionality. No problems what-so-ever picking up the wireless signal.
2,"Nice computer, poor signal strength",I have tried all of the available mounting options and moved all of the pieces around and have yet to get a consistent link between the computer and sensor. My Specialized Mtn Bike frame layout appears to be significantly different than what Sigma had in mind when they designed this unit. This unit would be nice if the radio was a little more sensitive.
2,quits working for no reason,"I never owned a bike computer until I bought my Sigma bike computer a few months ago. I now have approximately 1,900 km on it. I say approximately because several times, while riding, it has quit working for no reason. You get off the bike, fiddle with the transmitter, adjust the gap between the transmitter and magnet but still nothing. Then, magically, it starts working again. I've tried changing batteries but nothing works. Even when it is working, you have to remember to start it again if you stop for five minutes."
2,Not weatherproof,"At the begining this product was working perfectly, to my surprise because this computures usually give you a hard time. This was until I went to to a trial with losts of water and lots of rain, and some water must have gotten into the trasnmiter, because it wont work anymore. The display turns on fine, but wont receive any signal. I believe, these wireless computers are not worth it, for this reason. It worked fine about 3 or 4 times. Lost my money."
5,JUST LIKE THE GOOD OL DAYS,"I initally expected a burned copy, but it is the real, never opened, out of print CD. Perfect purchase. Seller was prompt, even received it on Christmas Eve, through USPS! Needless to say I am extremely pleased with this purchase, and everything I buy from Amazing Amazon."
5,Excellent product as others have already said - trust them because they are correct,I now have 3 bleacher seats and this one is by far the most comfortable and for a good price. Shipping was higher than I would have preferred but this came faster than the local fund raiser seat I ordered from the local football team. Can't miss with this one.
2,Stadium Seats,"Nice appearence, but doesn't provided padding that is comfortable for periods beyond a few minutes. Padding on cement or metal stadium seats are an essential reason for buying this product, but it disapoints."
3,Stadium Chair OK,"This stadium seat was ok. It really did not support my back the way I thought it would, but at least my butt did not hurt!"
4,Great Resource,"This book contains some great games for the elementary classroom. There are basic games that focus on phonemic awareness and more difficult games such as sequencing. Such topics include: inferring, conclusions, cause/effect, vowel phonograms, blends, suffixes, and dividing syllables. I did find that the students enjoyed the games and they were easy to learn. They make excellent centers or independent work."
5,Great Games,This book provides great and economical ways to teach phonics. A must have in a teacher's toolkit. A great book!
4,Another winner from Mark Fuhrman,"Mark Fuhrman is a master at True Crime Books. I had never heard of these cases before. Fuhrman examines a high % of people put to Death in Oklahoma in one County by 1 DA and with most of the forensic evidence verified by 1 or 2 females. Because of either bias or incompetence Joyce Gilchrist made false and/or misleading statements that led to Guilty verdicts in Death Penalty Cases in Oklahoma County (Oklahoma City.) Fortunately some of the verdicts were overturned. Prior to reading this boos I (as was Fuhrman) was a strong supporter of the Death Penalty. These cases changed Fuhrman's mind. There is one great quote in the book, to paraphrase "" since Humans make mistakes there has to be a way to correct the mistakes"". (Obviously if a person is put to death the mistake can not be corrected.)"
4,Death and Justice,"A good study of the death penalties and how slow they are, how innocent persons can get the sentence.Havfe not finished reading it."
4,Awesome service,"Product was just as described, great quality, and delivered promptly and safely. I would wholeheartedly recommend this dealer to others."
1,RIP OFF,"I PURCHASE THIS 2 VOLUME SET AND NEVER GOT THE SECONG ONE, I CONTACTED THE SELLER AND HE REFUSED TO SEND ME MY SECOND BOOK. THATS WHY ITS A RIP OFF THANKS RENE"
5,an interesting read,Street's Sons draws you into the characters' lives from page one until the very end where an unexpected twist sends your heart reeling. You don't know whether to respect Street or hate Street by the end of the story for the decisions he made.You are taken into several different lives and given brief glimpses of what makes them all tick and what breaks them.
3,fairly good drum n bass,"Out of the 7 tracks on this CD, I only cared for 3 (two of which are the same song but remixed differently). The best track on the CD by far is Paradox's ""A certain sound."" If you've heard of one of the tracks on this CD before and absolutely have to get it, then it may be worth the dollars.Here is the track listing--it's missing from above:1.) Nemesis Feat. DJ Kane - System 2.) Paradox - A Certain Sound 3.) Future Forces Inc. - The Killer 4.) Genotype - Toxic 5.) Monochrome - Natural Auras 6.) Paradox - Some Kind Of Illusion 7.) Future Forces Inc. - The Killer"
2,Works Okay,It is a green color (because of the green tea extract in it) and has a strange smell. I wasn't very impressed and won't buy it again.
3,Dissapointment for me.,"""Mirror Of Madness"" is a really tough CD to follow. Unfortunatly, Norther doesnt pull through with ""Death Unlimited."" They seem to have decided to make songs heavier and rely less on melodies. Some may like that, but when it comes to Norther, I would rather hear melodies than crunchy parts. Not as many memorable tracks on this CD, the keyboards dont impress me too much. I must admit, there are some very good guitar solos and I give them credit for trying out clean vocals. Some songs are catchy and make me want to sing along. I wouldnt say don't buy this album, I'll just say get their other albums first."
2,Pretty interesting but...........,"I am nearly done reading this book and I thought I would never get through it. While it is fairly good in substance, I really didn't learn anything new about satan. I am well aquainted with his tricks, personally!! I did have a little trouble with the music part though. The author seems to think only one type of Christian music written years ago is God-breathed and legitimate. Doesn't he understand that at one time the Psalms were contemporary? What really bothered me about this book is the grammer. In reality it is probably the publishers fault but it is abysmal! For most of the book ""lair"" is used for liar and that's just one small example. And if you saw the word diffidently, what would you think it meant? I don't remember it's intended use now, maybe it was defiantly. It is really hard to tell who's talking at times. The punctuation, grammer, misspelling and wrong use of words kinda ruined this book for me. Larry P"
4,Useful advises to change forever our children's personality.,"Excelent book, well organized. Useful for everyone that has a real interest to help their children during the best age they can be helped. More than 10 very valuable hints that you can try immediately with your children."
4,Libro en Español,"Es un libro de muy buen contenido, a veces redunda en lo mismo el autor, y la letra es demasiado pequeña."
3,What do you expect of a rubber chicken?,"The chicken had the effect I wanted -- as a joke. But, I was a bit disappointed in the quality of the product since it was advertised as a ""Deluxe"" rubber chicken. The body of the chicken was coming apart at the seams. It was still fun, however."
4,Nautica Latitude Longitude,"The product arrived in a few days, packaged nicely however the spray nozzle is askew and the bottle has to be held at an uncomfortable angle in order for the product to be applied properly. all in all a great product for a great price."
3,"Cover basics, not much else","I'd recommend this book for women who are beginners to poker or who intend to play just for kicks in a fun, home game. If one is looking for more advanced poker strategy, there are better books to turn to. The best part of the book is the chapter on poker lingo. Knowing the language is an important part of table image and Bochan covers all the necessary terms well so an attentive reader will not look like a novice. If only she had delved further into poker strategy- some illustrated examples would have helped."
3,Do NOT buy the kit.,"Although this book may be satisfactory, do NOT buy the poker set, which includes a summed-up version of this book, along with four shot glasses, four stir sticks, coasters, and a pack of cards. It is absolutely not worth your time or money. It cost forty dollars Canadian, and the book is information you can simply find for free online. I'm working on getting a refund right now."
4,Getting familiar with the unfamiliar (or infamiliar),"From a dark sticky Rorschach spot on the face of a Nobody to an illuminating but all too wacko-wacky autopsy involving a mesomorph who pretends to be a corpse... This can be nothing other than the gloomy, moody, brooding and often all to weird literary mind games the young American D. Harlan Wilson likes to cook up.If you liked his former menu's with literary gourmet stuff ""The Kafka Effekt"" and ""Stranger on the loose"", you will no doubt like this dish. It's the perfect blend of short movies making with a director going bananas, and literary wit, freshness and creativity.Too off-beat for most common housewives perhaps, too mind bending for white boards and stiff-suits, but ultimately rewarding for everyone with a taste for the awkward and the insane."
5,A great reference to the butch-femme community of the 1950's,"This video refers historically to the well-documented butch-femme community that was organized during the 1950's. There is a lovely story within the story that is based on the pulp fiction genre. It encompasses an era when the roles in the lesbian community were more clearly defined. This film is heroic, funny, and celebratory. A must see!"
4,"Basically a boring documentary, but the mini-movie was HOT!","Yes, weaving in and out of this lengthy & dull documentary of Canada's lesbian community during the 1950's was a pleasant ""mini-movie"" showing a pretty blonde farm girl in the big city, finding herself seduced by an ultra-hot dark-haired beauty! It was this movie-within-a-movie that made this one work for me! But next time, Ms. Producer, why not just make a longer erotic mini-flick and leave the documentary stuff for Sixty Minutes?"
1,not all part supplied per Amazon description,"I do not recommend ordering this Item from Amazon. The description for the Valley 65980 Class II Receiver Hitch comes with the ""Ball mount, pin and clip are included with this hitch. All Valley trailer hitches have a limited lifetime warranty.""Mine did not! Called customer support, they wanted me to return the Item that took over a week to ship. It came open without being boxed or protected very well.Asked Amazon to ship the missing items and they stated ""I would have to return the Hitch."" Looks like I will have to purchase the other items at my cost. I will never order for Amazon again.The photo and what you get is different as well. But I was going off the text and description. Further more Amazon staff just hung up the phone while I was talking to them. Customer service with Amazon is poor."
5,wrong kindle book downloads if you purchase.,"I adore my paperback copy of this book - flint and aura have great chemistry. however when i purchased the kindle edition of this book the wrong book downloads. i have called and emailed amazon with no response. i would recommend downloading the first chapter before purchasing this book and make sure it has aura and flint. my first complaint on this one was in July 2012 and as of October 2012 amazon has still not fixed. the real story (again with aura and flint - not the book amazon gives you for the kindle edition) is a great read, if you enjoy other books by Robyn Donald this is a great edition."
3,"Good price, below average insulation.","CONS- as other reviews this is too small for our boiler, but since our boiler is in the corner right at the two walls, I would not able to wrap it around the whole boiler anyways- be ready for TONS and TONS of fiberglass dust after you are done everywhere in your garage - close car windows, doors to your house... (make sure to wear special clothes, respiratory mask, hat, glasses and gloves) - not exaggerating - you can argue that we are married with fiberglass these days - true - but even after adding blow-in (AttiCat) insulation to the attic it was not so messy job...- more tape should be provided, used FlexFix from Nashua to fill the missing feets/meeters of tape neededPROS- after applying the insulated part is about 8F (4C) colder than the uninsulated part - so it really works (reason for 3 stars)OTHER THOUGHTS- let you wife know what you are up to so she does not feel surprised seing you hugging the boiler in the garage :) :) :)Have fun!"
1,doesnt fit my 50 gallon tank,"I bought this after reading that it would fit ""most heaters up to 60 gallons"". Well, I dont know if it will fit ""most"" or not, but it wasnt even close in height or width for my 50 gallon. After measuring, I now realize that my tank would need 52"" x 90"" at minimum to cover. What is worse is that the fiberglass gets everywhere once you take it out of the packaging. You need gloves, long sleeves AND MOST IMPORTANTLY a mask. I wore gloves and a long sleeve t-shirt and my arms still itched all over and I was coughing (HACKING, really) for hours after. CAVEAT EMPTOR and if you must buy it, wear heavy gloves, thick clothes and a respirator."
2,use caution before ordering,"okay, I admit I should have examined the details provided for the product before ordering. But I saw the product said it fit up to a 60 gallon water heater. Well after getting it and opening the package and measuring the product I quickly realized that it would not fit my 40 gallon water heater. So I must order an aditional blanket."
5,Fits 40 Gallon Tank,"Fit our 40 Gallon tank perfectly.I read the reviews before purchase. I am not sure the diameter of a 60 gallon tank, but I would make sure before ordering.Save energyGod Bless"
1,Somewhat lacking in specific guidelines.,"I was disappointed with this book's lack of specifics. I was looking for insight into which flowers should be paired together in arrangements, with specific suggestions. This book simply did not provide enough for a beginner to know how to choose the right combinations. The pictures were not what I was looking for since I want to do an impressive arrangement for a dining room, and the book showed mainly smaller basic arrangements. It's focus was more on exploring your own creativity; I ended up returning it."
2,"This guy is very artistic, however not enough instruction.","This book is very pretty. However, it does not provide enough illustrations of silk flowing arranging. I don't think many people buy it just to look at pretty pictures. Most want instruction, examples and ideas. The book is really lacking in all three."
4,Good tips arranging flowers,"Pretty book. I wish there were more tips on the actual arranging of flowers. I did not personally care for any of the arrangements that were in the book, though. Good book if the price is right. Nice photographs."
5,"New, fascinating, definitely the best work on silk flowers","New, fascinating, definitely the best work on silk flowers ever. I felt both like a painter and sculptor reading (watching) this book. At last flower arrangements that will look natural and last. Wonderful flowers, always, everywhere, YES, IT IS POSSIBLE."
5,Glad these are now on DVD,"These mysteries are excellent. I actually like them better than the original books. David Suchet makes the character of Poirot much more understandable, and likeable."
3,A Poirot Fan,"David Suchet brings Agatha Christie's Poirot to life as no other actor has. The stories are marvelous; the supporting cast is wonderful, and the picture quality is good. However, there are problems with the sound. I am hearing impaired and the sound on these DVDs is unusually low and indistinct which makes the accents very difficult to understand. Amazon states on their web site that the DVDs are close captioned, but they are not. The poorer quality of the sound and the absence of close captioning are problems for anyone with hearing difficulties."
4,The Adventure of Johnnie Waverly,"Dear Friends of Poirot:Of the three stories on this DVD the above mentioned story is not too good from my standpoint. Johnnie Waverly is lacking in the usual indepth focus these great stories normally have.See it once and you seen it enough ! Had I recognized this item by its name, etc. I would not have purchased this DVD.The other two stories are First Class!"
1,Note! Not closed-captioned as stated,"This is advertised as closed-captioned which is why we selected it for my mother-in-law who is hard of hearing. However, it is not closed-captioned."
3,Dissapointed,"Usually before buying a product I check the reviews. Guess my enthusiasm, since i am a big Agatha Christie fan, this time played me because when I saw that this product was close captioned I bought it right away without checking the reviews. Its not close captioned, and that bothers me since I needed a product with those specifications and it fooled me into thinking that it was. That's why I gave it 3 star. The rest is fine. I think David Suchet plays a wonderful role as Hercules Poirot."
5,Barnaby's Top 10,"Interesting to see Nettles' favorite Midsomer Murder episodes were quite different than my own favorites. Many of my friends are also fellow addicts of Midsomer Murders and their favorite episodes were closer to my choices so it was illuminating. Although all these episodes were familiar, Midsomer Murders' DVDs are so absorbing that my circle have watched many an episode repeatedly and I have started watching them all from the beginning."
4,the new cool is here,"old album but its good, kind of jazz/fusion but its good. This is Jazz at its finest, relax with a glass or wine or put on and play in the background for picnic, barbecue or while doing homework. Works like a charm."
2,Fear & Dread through Reading!!!,"Although definitely a promising topic, this ""history of terror"" falls a long way short of its potential. While the author has draw on a vast number of diverse sources, the resulting work fails in maintaining any central theme and at times left me wondering about the relevance of the title to the work."
5,We liked it,"We needed a dead fish for a Halloween costume related to the BP oil spill. This worked real good.We looked at several other rubber fish online, and this guy looked like the best."
3,It's a rubber fish,"This is a solid rubber fish.However, it smells like it might be toxic (perhaps from the slightly oily kind of resin coating on the rubber). I wouldn't use this in a bathtub or let kids or dogs play with it.Also, I definitely wouldn't say that it's ""so realistic you could mount it on your wall"". It did the job for me, but honestly I was expecting better from that description.Also note, unless my order was a mistake- all that is included is the actual fish. No game/activity sheets.BUT-I used it as a prop in a comedy video- so I didn't mind the almost toxic smell, I didn't need the activity sheet, and it turned out OK that it doesn't look real. It served its purpose."
5,As advertised,The fish was exactly what I expected. Solid design and was a great addition to my son's Halloween costume as well as a great toy for him after the holiday.
2,Picture was not what I received,"The other reviewer wasn't kidding. I don't know anything about fish and I've never fished before, but what I received was certainly unexpected.Look above at my pictures. I expected a white-green color scheme but instead got a yellow black one.The scales in the picture look great, but when I received the product it appeared to be some quick triangle pattern.Mine was also slippery with some sort of grease when I received it. Maybe it's one of this hit-n-miss products because other reviewers haven't had a problem.So why am I, someone who never fished, buying this, and despite what I received, giving it at least 2 stars? Well it's a bass isn't it? I don't know if others buy things like this to hang in their living room or let their kids play, but I really only bought this bass to bring to parties and hang-outs with friends and you know, drop it.And it looks like it can do that just fine. A bit bouncy though."
5,Seems like a throwaway...,"This little cover seems like a throwaway and could easily be replaced by a piece of cardboard and some duct tape, but for the price and what it does, it works perfectly. You probably don't need it if your boat parks under a canopy, but mine is in the open, so having this keeps the rain from the connections.Being someone who believes electricity sits in a wire after the power is shut off, I figure anything to keep the power connections from rusting can't be a bad idea."
3,Humminbird Cover,"Fits snug, but I would not keep it on when going down the road unless you add a rubber band to hold in place. I knew this before ordering. Does what it is suppose to do and that is to keep the elec. conections clean. Great product that should of came with the bird..."
4,"Good Product, but WAY TOO expensive!","Nice Product with Humminbird LoGo on it and it fits fairly good, but not to be left on while trailering. Cover was WAY OVER PRICED for a little piece of foam rubber with a LoGo on it. Wish I would have known ahead of time..."
3,A title is really rather lame...,"It fits, but I wouldn't trust it to stay there upon travel... Oh, you want twenty more words? Twenty, twenty, twenty, twenty, twenty, twenty, twenty, twenty, ect..."
5,worked as described,"worked as described. they could have made it out of a more durable material, however it's a dust cover. so"
4,"Perfect fit,,,,,,but pricey","Perfect fit. Does the job but is a little pricey IMO.,,,however I did buy it obviously. It is well made and should last forever."
2,Expected more,"I had read other reviews but decided to buy this to protect my connections on my Hummingbird 597 Combo DI unit. I would agree that this should really be included with the sonar as it is simply a rubber cover and not worth the almost $10. That said, it is still needed to protect the connections."
3,Something for Everyone,"This book has something for everyone from beginning researchers to seasoned professionals. Unfortunately, it's not particularly easy to find the sections most likely to be of interest to any given reader. As noted in the Amazon description, the book is organized into six parts. That structure is only slightly helpful because the range of topics discussed within each part is very broad, no attempt is made to integrate the chapters, and because the chapters are written by different people so they don't progress from the basic to the sophisticated but rather skip around. There's an index, but that's only helpful if you know exactly what you're looking for. The only other alternative is browsing through the book for the sections of interest to you and skipping the rest. That places a greater burden on the reader than is necessary; however if you're involved in marketing research, you're likely to find enough that interests you to make it worth both the effort and the price."
3,Previously released material!,"These guys are spectacular, if you like the Django and haven't heard them GET IT!!!!!!That said this is actually 2 live cds and a dvd that were previously released."
3,everything i expected,"and, possibly, less. Written by the woman who brought Wayne Hays down because he didn't bother sending her a wedding invitation, this was a reasonably entertaining roman a clef, enlivened by her encounters with real-life figures like Ron Ziegler, and by thinly disguised portraits of the various politicos she slept with."
1,Outdated!,"This could have well be a good book in its day, but its day is long since gone! The methods are almost all outdated.....reads more like a history book than a ""how to do"" book. If you feel you must have it, buy the cheapest used one that you can find."
5,great children's book,Our family loves this book. Our kids will read it over and over again. We own a lot of children's books (around 150) and this is one of the best.
5,Another great Gerlach read,"1st off ignore any reviews from people who have a problem with good authors. If Gerlach basis his novels on Laymon, then he is basing it on one of horrors masters.Gerlach has his own style and is one's of horror's brightest authors out there. This book is one of my fave's, nearly as good as the magnificent Love Lies Dying.Anyone who has had Gerlach recommended to them has enjoyed him. Check this out and I gurantee you'll think it's good.Raven and Amber are 2 friends and Lake Mountain is the story of there journey to get rid of a body...there are some great twists and some totally out of there scenes that any horror fan will enjoy.Say no more....just check this guy out if your a fan of Richard Laymon, Brian Keene and Brett McBean."
5,A fun toy!,"I got the Hydro Strike for Christmas. It's really simple to set it up. You put water in the blue tube. Then you pump it up. ( 20 times.) Then you launch a ball and play. There is one problem. You have to hit it pretty hard to get the water to shoot out. It's not really water it's more of a mist. But don't worry you still get soaked. This toy is really cool. Worth the price. If you want to see more reviews by me, type in CHILL SPEEDER(Lego) mine is the one that reccommends the ICE BLADE. Then type in ICE BLADE. It's the one that reccomends the CHILL SPEEDER. Homie G. out."
1,junk,My daughters wanted this so bad for Christmas. We will be returning it tomarrow. If the ball dosn't hit the target hard and I mean hard the water sprayer dosen't work and of course that's why they wanted. My advice don't buy it. A squirt gun works better and is a whole lot cheatper.
1,Forget It,"Disappointing. I expected a book about the vibrant developments in US Catholic university apostolates, like FOCUS, the former UIUC Newman Center etc etc. Instead, this is a bureacratic apology for the ""Catholic"" colleges doing nothing to promote Catholic identity. After looking at a couple of chapters, I decided not to waste my time on this nonsense."
2,"some good stuff, some lame stuff","If this is the best rock music from the catalogue of Dot Records, it's no wonder they're out of business. There are a few good songs, but a lot of it is watered-down rockabilly or Pat Boone-ish covers of R&B songs, and a lot of it leans more toward country. My favorite song is ""Transfusion"" a really weird song by someone named Nervous Norvus about having to get blood transfusions from all of the car accidents he has had. This is not essential stuff, you can pretty much skip it and not miss anything."
5,A great book to get started with for Maldives trip planning,"I'm looking at going to the Maldives sometime in 2010, and I'd love to know more about it before I blindly book a ticket and plan on visiting without knowing more about what I'm getting myself into.The book itself is fairly comprehensive with a lot of information on eco-friendly activities (this seems to be a recent trend in travel books), along with comprehensive information about dive sites.No doubt that the Maldives is one of the most expensive places in the world, and that you'll need time to put away money to going there. When budget hotels start at around $250 a night, I want a book that helps me figure out where and how I can get the most out of my money, and this book helps give me a good foundation on what to expect when landing."
3,"Good book, seems outdated",I read this book several times for an upcoming trip. I believe it is a very opinion orientated book instead of actual facts. Half the book is very informative. Not sure if worth the price for such a small book.
3,Great hat - Very late!,"I ordered this hat for my husband for Christmas. The credit card was charged and I received no notice from the company that it would be dealyed. I called, finally, to see if it would arrive in time for the holiday to discover that it would not and would not arrive until March!"
3,Very Australian independent stories,"Tim Winton is one of the most respected writers in Australia. I'm not especially keen for short stories, and I cannot remember the last time I read a book of short stories. However, I wanted to try out a Winton book so I started with this one. His scenes, language, and characters are uniquely Australian, and he provides a good spread of Australian life by including multiculturalism in some of his stories, and various aspects of Australian History. I did find myself stuck many times in this book feeling perplexed by the subtlety of Winton's style.Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author"
2,"Good idea, lousy execution","This toy looks fun, but the ladybug head always gets stuck when it is pushed down and it is hard for a toddler to really enjoy this product because it is frustrating to re-align it. The idea is great for teaching cause and effect, but I think there are probably better toys out there that are similar. My child has more fun pushing down our OXO salad spinner instead of this, even though their aren't colorful balls involved. Good idea, but the design is just not very good because the ladybug top slips out of alignment."
2,Ladybug bummer!,"We ordered this toy for our public library's toddler program. Unfortunatley, we are returning it because the head of the ladybug constantly gets stuck and the balls do not pop, roll or do anything. Very colorful, nice concept, but disappointing!"
2,Air Deflector,This item would work if the vents in the houses had magnetic frames. Found out though that vents do not have magnetic frames anymore.
4,Ok,"Magnets are strong enough to hold it to ceiling vent and it's deflecting the air just like it's supposed to. However, it is a very cheap and poor extending design. The slightest touch will make it come apart and fall off the vent. Takes a very delicate touch to get it in place, but now that it's is in place it works."
2,"Air Deflector, Cheap plastic and lousy magnet","I have done the research and it seems like there is no real good air deflector out on the market. I am not to sure how this product is working for other people but here is what I am working with;* Ceiling type vent* Air damper control* About 12"" widePro's:* Variable width from 8"" to 14""* Magnets that should hold deflector onto a metal ventCon's:* Cheap plastic seems easy to crack* When adjusted width to anything past 10"", it becomes very loose and falls apart. ( I needed to super glue the two pieces together once I found my correct width )* Magnets would not hold ( I had to drill holes so that I could use the vent cover screws to hold deflector in place )Item were so cheap in cost that I could not find a good reason to spend anymore money to ship them back to the seller. At this point I will deal with it since I already did my own modification. Hope this gives everyone a better idea what they are getting themselves into when you buy these items."
3,Good idea,"These work. For more stability I would crazy glue them together once you adjust it. Only takes a drop or two, don't even have to lift it up, just place it at the seems. Also, a drop of crazy glue for the magnets to stay in place. A couple have fallen down my air vent."
5,Works as advertised,"I recently bought new dressers for my bedroom but the issue is that it was bigger than the one before and now covered the vent in the room. All the cold air from the AC was getting trapped back there and the room was hot.Got this the other day and while it took some fiddling to get it mounted, I finally did and it works perfectly. With the dresser pushed up against the deflector, all the air gets forced up to the ceiling where the fan distributes it evenly.One tip is to make sure that the magnets are flush with the side of the unit you are trying to attach to the vent. I was having problems with the magnets not holding when I realized they were pushed back a little bit and that's why it wouldn't stay put."

5,Wonderful classroom read aloud,I used Charlie Anderson in my 2nd grade classroom to teach inferring and questioning. Also a good example of finding love in 2 different households which is important to many of our young students.
1,Charlie Anderson,"Although the story should be a great read for children having difficulties with split families. The page where Elizabeth ask ""Who do you love the best,"" could plant in a childs mind that one must make a choice as to which parent do you love the best, or even cause the child to wonder if he/she is loved the ""best"". The book would have been excellent had it not been for this one page. I suggest it be re-written."
5,A Cat is Loved and Shared by Two Families.,"Many children can relate to this simple and beautifully illustrated story. Two young girls, Elizabeth and Sarah discover a secret about their cat, Charlie Anderson, when he doesn't return home one stormy night. Charlie has TWO homes. He stays with them during the night and spends the day with another family. Both families dearly love and care for the cat. The two families realize that Charlie Anderson should be shared because of their mutual love for him.A Note for Teachers: This is a wonderful book to read to children when discussing the family units. Children of divorce and separation can quickly identify with Charlie Anderson. Just like Charlie, children can find reassurance that they are still very much loved even though they are shared by two families."
5,Beautiful illustrations,"For our family, the lovely soft watercolored illustrations were the best feature of this sweet, yet unsurprising story. The illustrations evoke a time before step-families were commonplace, and though the text refers to watching TV, the pictures present a world where bad things only happen in books."
4,Movie that couldn't be made any more,This is a movie of romantic stories that occur around the Yellow Rolls Royce of the title. In this way the style resembles TV shows like Love American Style which came later. This kind of evocation of romance in cinema really doesn't exist any more. The 60s was an era of romantic movies like no other decade. The use of big names in story vignettes is something that could only have been done well back then.
2,Overrated sixties film,The cast is impeccable but the story is pretty woeful and slow moving.The only real reason to recommend this film is for the unforgettable soundtrack.
4,Classic movie,This is an excellent movie about a classic car that changes hands through the years. It's interesting to see the different stories which evolve around the different owners. We thoroughly enjoyed it.
4,The Yellow Rolls Royce,"This is a favorite from my teen years. I have watched it at least a half dozen times. Somehow, it is not as catchy now as it was then. But, it is still a favorite."
4,A Classic Movie,"This movie is highly enjoyable through the ventures of ""The Yellow Rolls Royce"". An all-Star cast. You will not be disappointed."
2,Not for people looking for advanced skills!,"This book provides only very basic information about SEO, not thing very technical and advanced and you can probably find these information on the web. No need to buy!"
3,An interesting tale,"This movie is ok. Not the best asian horror film I have seen. The movie starts off kind of boring. We see these kids getting back togther after awhile because one of the friends father has died. They stay with their old teacher who is actually one of the kids step-parent. In the past, the kids have a secret. While trying to videotape the gym teacher having sex with the step-mother they are caught and rapped. They take revenge by placing a spell on him. The step-mother finds this out and takes revenge on them while they are staying with her. Each death is quite gruesome. This film is a low quality thai movie. I love asian horror and this movie has its moments. It does not stand up to par with movies such as Infection, Tell me something, or even Premonition."
4,Way better than the first....,"I watch the first one first before watching the second one and I must say that the two does not connect. You can watch this one without bothering with the first one as the first one was just ok. The second one was actually pretty good. The story line itself was awesome. Its about black magic. Watch the film closely so you'll understand why things are happening towards the end. I'm not into gore and many scenes were very ""gorey"" to me, I had to look away or cringe many times. All in all, great movie."
3,Hit or miss,"I was so excited to get this book! To me, making sure you have all the ingredients is the most difficult part about cooking, and I hate seeing recipies with half a page of ingredients listed.Unfortunately, my husband was not that enamored with most of the recipies. Things like salmon loaf, easy Mexican dish, peachy chicken, and broccoli bake, I was requested to never make again.On the other hand, the candied chicken and coconut chicken we both liked pretty well. And I think the cookbook was worth it just for ""Mike's Babe Ruth Bars."" It is my very favorite cookie recipie and I often have people ask me for it.Like others mentioned, the recipies do rely heavily on processed, pre-packaged foods.There are a few things."
4,good set,the best of the ones offered in the New Jack Swing smooth jams collection. alot of jams here though a few acts on here weren't what i'd call New Jack Swing acts. nevertheless some cool slow jams and must have jams. enjoy.
1,New Age Non-Sense,"I suggest Ackerman peruse air photography documentation of the industrial clear cutting of old growth forests to see how well nature can ""take care of itself"" which Donna Seaman of Booklist approvingly quotes, otherwise this book is only Ackerman's embarrassing self-gratification."
2,Had High Hopes,"I really wanted to like this book. It was given to me by a friend and even though I knew that it wasn't published by a big ""house"" I thought that maybe the characters would be interesting and that the story would be a metaphor for the current situation in the world. It wasn't. I love super heroes and all the mythology that goes with them, but I couldn't get into this book. It was just really boring. I didn't care about anyone and Herotown just confused me."
4,Worth a look...,"My 10 year old daughter loved this movie. The dialogue took just a little concentration (no goofing around or you'll miss something) but she absolutely loved it. The animation was beautiful, classic and adorable. Younger viewers will probably like it just for that. Wish I could find it for sale."
5,Very satisfied,I'm enjoying this product very much it tends to come in handy when I need somewhere to store my phone.
4,Nice case but not for me...,"I bought this case to use with my Blackberry Pearl. It's a light pink leather-like case and it has a clip on the back. The inside of this case is great because it will minimize scratches to the screen of your phone. Also, the case is magnetic, so it opens and closes easily. I personally do not like it for my Pearl though because the trackball rubs against ths inside of the case too much. Other than that, I think it would make a great phone case for the other phone types listed."
5,My kids loved this!,"""Sing Yourself Silly"" is fun,colorful and full of great songs. My older kids loved it now I'm buying it again for my new baby!! You can trust Sesame Street to do a great job with kids and this particular bunch of songs and characters will have you and your kids singing along and laughing hysterically. This is definitely not a before bedtime video!"
1,don't bother,"I bought this video for my (almost) 2-year old who is a HUGE Sesame Street fan. We were both terribly disappointed. The only song we enjoyed was ""Put Down the Ducky"" - really great segment, actually, but not enough to make up for the rest of the video. My daughter is specifically interested in anything and everything Sesame Street but was bored with this video because the characters she knows and loves (Big Bird, Bert, Ernie, ELMO, Cookie) had only bit parts. The main characters were ordinary monsters that she doesn't recognize and the songs were none that she'd ever heard before. It's possible that over time she'd grow to like this, but she won't sit still long enough to find out.Buy a different video if you're looking for familiar faces and songs!"
4,Yummers!,"Although bearing only a fairly marginal resemblance to the sweet traditionally known as Turkish delight, these are pretty good. The inside is a semi-reasonable facsimile of traditional Turkish delight (although far softer and less chewey in texture) which is then coated in a very think outer layer of milk chocolate.As chocolate bars go... uh... well, they're low-fat, I suppose! I think the innards are pure gelatin and sugar.Do be aware that these come in a variety of packs containing different numbers of bars. At least as of the time of writing, these do not all work out at the same cost on a per bar basis. So it may well be worth your while doing your homework before deciding which deal is right for you.Enjoy in Moderation!Theo."
2,Not what you think,"I really like Turkish Delight, I used to eat it all the time in England. Thing is, I spent about 8 dollars total for these three bars, and these are in fact the tiny little palm size bars. They actually packed them into a much larger box so I was pretty surprised when I opened them at how small they are. So yes, the product is good, but I wouldn't buy it from here."
2,this is boring,this book is extremely boring. i got it for a class and i've honestly fallen asleep like 5 times while reading it. Chapter 6 is over 100 pages long. I had to read it in one day. that really sucked. dont get this book to help you with writing. get this book if you want to fall asleep
3,So So.,"I am beginner in learning Spanish and find this book quite difficult. Concentrates on grammar way too much and the vocabulary listed does not start with simple words and build up, but throws you into the deep end right away. I would recommend this book only to an advanced student."
5,Muy Bien!,I have sat around at Barnes & Noble flipping through all sorts of spanish books and finally came across this one. It's DEFINATELY the EASIEST to read. The chapters are broken up really well towards everday situations. Compared to other books this one has plentiful of variety of vocabs to learn (also has pronunciation for it to help you say the words correctly). So I'm really confident with this one!
2,power of magnet,"Visually this is an interesting and appealing toy and, in theory, is a great way to teach a child to count. However, the magnet in the wand does not have enough grab to hold the balls as a child moves them thru the maze. Ended up being a huge frustration."
2,"Great whistle, no instruction on how to make duck calls","Searched the web for any information on what I'm supposed to do with this thing. Found nothing. Thought it would be great for hunting with my dog and sending whistle commands, but it's worthless to me as a duck call."
5,Lovely book for traveling to Arizona,I purchased this book for my mother before we took a trip to Arizona together. It is beautiful and was very helpful in planning our trip.
4,60s rockers,"this band played seattle area for quite awhile. i saw them many times at a club downtown. these guys rocked the place every time i saw them my favorite song is ""crackshot"". i have the LP and play it occasionally. the music has past the test of time pretty well considering it was released 43 years ago. it is a testament of music of the sixties. t.kithcart bainbridge island"
3,It doesn't cover anything,"I was so excited to see a service plan for under $300. But when you read their terms and conditions, this plan covers next to nothing. It does not cover any kind of screen damage, damage to any drives, and the BATTERY among other things. This is a great price if you have faith in NOTHING going wrong with your computer. Also, this only begins coverage after the manufacturer warranty is expired, which gives it more of a positive-negative effect. If you cannot afford a real plan, this is a great alternative. Otherwise, go with a more substantial service plan."
4,Good product,"Sony VAIO VGN-CR309E/L 14.1-inch Laptop (1.6 GHz Intel Pentium Dual Core T2330 Processor, 2 GB RAM, 200 GB Hard Drive, Vista Premium) Blue"
2,Not very Vibrant :(,"I expected more vibrant color...but if you prefer pale shades, then this is the chalk for you."
5,GREAT Intro to Starting a Business!,"This book is the best so far in terms of inspiration and motivation as well as being a complete how-to. Being part of the Gen E, I found this book useful in starting my own business. It is easy to read, very thorough and well written. Great Job Brian!"
1,Product not as described!,"I was extremely disappointed when I received this product. Contrary to the description, the handles are hard plastic - not ""comfortable and soft"" as it states on the product packaging and website. Other than that it may be a decent product, but after only a few reps your hands will hurt and will have the design from the grips imprinted on your skin. I've already printed the label to return to Amazon.Beware the other review of this product, the individual posted the same review for all ab wheels sold on Amazon. Not only is it not informative, there is a good chance they have never tried the product."
1,Awful seller..Beware...,"I am waiting for my replacement plan since March 5th (till date March 14th) with no suitable & satisfying reply from Seller. My delivery date ends on March 16th...Amazon to be careful with such sellers. Buyers to have to be careful, there are other playrs selling such plans try them rather this companyI donot know why sending just a email takes so long for seller."
3,Good Preformance But terrible video apperance,Yea it could have been better but what did they have to work with. Very old clips.
2,TRENDnet54Mbps Wireless G USB Adapter,Item works but is much slower than anticipated. I will need to upgrade to a faster adapter.
3,connects great one slight problem,"Our computer is connecting just fine. However, we did have to remove the protection cap to plug it into the usb port on the front of our pc. You can put the cap back on though."
3,working fine until,"ok it was cool and was working fine until, i tried tried playing Halo combat evolved for pc. Listen and note, it will NOT hold a connection with Halo combat evolved, and it lags with other games. I changed my router settings and everything and it will not work, trust me i'm on my way to getting my Cisco certification, i know what im talking about"
1,You get what you pay for,This is a cheap adapter but does not work too well for me.The connection keeps getting dropped all the time (especially on an encrypted network - I dont know about simple network). I see a connection drop at least every 30 minutes during active work. The connection usually comes back in 20-40 seconds. not a big deal but does disturb when I am streaming music or have VPN-ed into my office network.The strength of the signal is not a problem as my wireless router and the computer to which this card is hooked are in the same room and my laptop (with built-in wireless chip) works perfectly with no disconnects.I bought it for its cheap cost but now regret it.I would suggest stay away from this card; pay a little more and go with an established vendor like Linksys.
4,Works Good just don't remove often,"This works very good and easy to install, the only problem we had is after removing it several times it broke. I think typical of Chinese goods they do not have a long shelf life, but then again they are cheap. Otherwise it worked great from a long distance, I would recommend for people with stationary computers. If you going to move often and unplug often it may cause some issues."
4,"quick and easy, but only temp",It lasted a few months but then the usb got bent too much and stopped working. If you're using the internet as much as me try getting a card. The reason it lasted to long was because I had an extension cord on it.
2,OK...for the price,"A bit slow...doesn't do well when sending larger files. for basic browsing of the web or networking, barely gets the job done."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money!,This adapter worked for 1 hour and that is it. I have not been able to get it to work again. Even tried it on my laptop and nothing.
4,was easy to install,"I have a desktop computer and I had a problem with my internet connection for the distance from my router, for that i bought this item, my internet connection problems finish it for ever with my new wireless connection."
5,"Small, Easy, Convenient","This wireless USB adapter was exactly what I was looking for! It comes with a short cord that doesn't block the other USB port on the front of our desktop computer. It hangs down from the port, but still allows us to close the cabinet door (not a great deal of space there). It works quickly, so much so that our computer actually has to catch up at times...Great product for the price. Just plug it in and it installs itself!"
3,"Cheap, it works, but not very sensitive","I bought this about a month ago because the built-in Wi-Fi adapter in my laptop is intermittently failing.The TRENDnet installed on my Windows 7 32-bit machine without any need for the CD that came with it. It works every time.That said, it is much less sensitive than the adapter inside my laptop (when that one works). Right now, the TRENDnet is connected to my Wi-Fi router, which is about five feet from my computer, but it doesn't even see the systems that two of my neighbors have. The laptop's adapter can see both of those all the time.For $12 it serves my purposes, but I sure couldn't use it when we travel and need to connect to RV park Wi-Fi systems."
1,Junk,"I picked this up because most of the similar options from big-name alternatives had some issue or other. I should've stuck with those issues, because this is junk. I've tried it with several computers and a couple of different driver versions, and every single one has suffered from unreliability and frequent network dropouts despite showing that it was A-OK and despite other computers on the network located right next to it working fine. On a purely aesthetic note it's an ugly design that sticks out in every sense of the phrase however you try to move it. Just avoid it."
1,Not for Linux,"This adapter is supposed to work well with Ubuntu, but I had nothing but difficulties with it. I don't recommend this at all."
5,"Works fine, no issues","Great adapter, picks up signals from a modem on the opposite side of the house with 93% strength.Works great even with USB 1.0, without any speed issues."
1,It gone and baked,"I thought this was a great little device. Simple plug&prey; function.Tagged it on the end of a 6' USB cable to my desktop, and started getting faint signals that popped in and out.Added a 16' USB cable to the assembly and walked it around, got a clear signal.Spent off and on a few days accessing and comparing to dial-up access, and DSL.Then one day did a 2-hour download session... the connection broke off, the light on the unit was blinking and it was almost too hot to touch.Now; can not get a fix, signals drift in and out, and it faults to blinking frequently. At best a 1/2 hour session happens, but crashes out.While one of the cheaper choices, avoidance is recommended, go buy a real one... maybe with a built-in cooling fan."
3,not the best,ok i plugged into my laptop and used windows to install it that took aobut 2 min then when im surfing playing games ect it cut out for about half a sec then goes rite back on i suggest getting a better adapter it is worth the money
2,Strong signal pickup - miserable drivers,"This got a much more reliable signal for me than my previous usb 802.11 adapters. However, the drivers caused my Windows XP machine to freeze up completely, requiring a hard reset, every 5 minutes until I gave up and uninstalled the drivers. I tried both the drivers on the CD with the product, as well as the downloadable drivers from the TrendNet site.So, I've given up and am looking for another brand. I would not recommend this product."
1,wireless adapter,TRENDnet54Mbps Wireless G USB AdapterI bought this wireless adapter because of the price and I guess it is true what they say...you get what you pay for. I had this product for only 45 days before it just quit on me.
2,Works great when it's working,"This little device works very well, but doesn't seem to work very often. Every time I plug it in to my PC, it treats it like a new device even though it has been installed previously. I have to run through the install routine every time I plug it in. May be a problem on my end, but I followed the install directions. I'm running a fresh, bare-bones XP install. Now, I can't even get Windows to recognize it at all. Frustrating."
5,Trendnet,This is a very good product. It works well with my netbook. I would recommend it to anyone needing to connect to the internet.
4,Cheap - Quick - Reliable,"The TrendNet was recommended by a co-worker, but I was skeptical. However for the price, the TrendNet USB Wireless adapter is great.My only problem was that the default speed was 54mps. The old PC in which I installed it could not keep up, so I slowed it down to 11mps and things are great.For the $20.00 I paid, it is the best investment ever.You can't even buy fast-food for a family of 4 for less than that.George"
1,Just plain junk,This thing doesn't even work. If I have my computer right next to the wireless router then it works. Good luck finding drivers for it too.
1,Didn't work as expected,I had 100% signal strength but only had an internet connection about 5% of the time. This adapter just didn't work for me.
3,wireless,"the product is seen well, good style, but the reach is limited, does not have much distance to work. thanks"
4,Great little product for the money,The product arrived sooner than expected and a snap to install. Just pop it in and it pretty much installs itself in WinXP. The reception range is not as strong as an internal card but that's what I would expect at this price. You shouldn't have any trouble connecting to your own local network though. Very pleased with the product.
3,easy install.. looses connectivity when other USB flash drive is plugged in,"I bought for cheap.. Very easy to install. Will loose the signal, if I plugin in another USB device into any empty slot.. Otherwise pretty decent."
2,Not good.,"First time it didn't work, unable to connect. I was thinking to return it. Then another day I tried again just to check one more time. Then it worked till now(almost 2 months). Another prob is it's get over heated. I won't recommend it."
2,Beware,Nice tackle box but may ship without any tackle whatsoever. Then you have to do all the legwork in returning it. Poor quality control in checking that there is tackle inside the tackle box.
5,GREAT TACKLE BOX!,"I got this tackle box on the year 2011 for my Christmas present. I only used it once but it works great. There were no problems with it at all, I hope you get this tackle box too!"
1,Not what I expected,"I bought this at the local Big Blue Box Store and am highly disappointed. I was hoping for a wider assortment of actual lures. There are ten little rubber something or others, two black worms, three sizes of hooks, two bobs and an assortment of other nonsense that will break in a minute if I decide to use them. I probably won't. I may not keep this as there may be a better deal."
2,"Box good, tackle minimal","This tackle box seems to be of good value but the included tackle is minimal. There are a few hooks, a couple of bobbers ans a coupkle of gummy worms. Nothing spectacular at all. The seller cant help this as this is a manufacturer issue but for 18 bucks it's a nominal deal."
5,"Perfect fit, worked great, easy to install","After searching far and wide for a dash kit for my wife's 2005 Kia Sedona, I ordered this one and was very pleasantly surprised by the ease of installation and how fast I was able to get the stereo in the vehicle. Once the harness kits were connected (that was the most time consuming part of the installation process, including testing every lead to ensure the connections were solid) it took me less than 15 minutes to have the old radio out and the new one installed. This kit fit perfectly into the Sedona's dash.It even came with the side pieces for installation of certain types of stereos, which I didn't need to use. The instructions were clear and concise, installation was a breeze, and the fit was awesome. My wife is completely happy with her stereo, and this kit was a major piece of it.I'd definitely recommend Metra dash kits to anyone."
2,meh,It didn't fit well upon installation and probably would have been better had I not ordered it at all. REALLY dissapointed!
3,To navigate & negotiate growin in the neighborhood,I didn't expect much from this movie in the 1st 5-10 mins.. But once Eric leaves the front steps his stroll becomes time pressed & anxious. I like how the parents give Eric the focus he needs to handle his business...
5,Family Film with Universal Appeal,"I saw this film when it opened the Milwaukee International Film Festival, where it won the Audience Choice Award. The large diverse crowd laughed and cried with the family and young protagonist as he did his best to avoid the obstacles and dangers around him as he walked to the pharmacy for his grandma. Every parent knows the dilemma of when to ""let go"" and of how much responsibility to give at what age. This universal dilemma is complicated for working class families living in somewhat marginal neighborhoods. Despite the packaging as a ""black film,"" this is a movie every parent will relate to and every kid from elementary age up will enjoy. There are few movies these days that a whole family can watch together, few that feel as authentic as this one. If you enjoyed Stand By Me, Raising Victor Vargas or Soul Food, you'll love Gettin' Grown.Raising Victor VargasStand By Me (Special Edition)Soul Food"
1,Mathemagic tricks quickly lose interest...,"This book was written by copying existing well-known tricks. In my opinion this is a waste of money, and my worst online purchase ever."
3,it was a very good book to me and my friends.,Sometimes the rugrats are a little strange to me they are very silly too. The rugrats get in to a lot of stuff too and they can be a pain in the butt sometimes too like my brother.
5,EXCELENT!!!,"Being a fan of the rugrats i bought this book because i loved the rugrats movie. I think this book is the best book i've ever read. It's deatailed and even has 8 pages of full colour stills from the movie. If you only buy 1 book a year, buy this book. You WON'T regret it!!!"
3,it was a very good book to me and my friends.,Sometimes the rugrats are a little strange to me they are very silly too. The rugrats get in to a lot of stuff too and they can be a pain in the neck sometimes too like my brother.
2,song list is horrible,"Unfortunately, this volume of the collection has too many of the Allman Brothers less pertinent songs (i.e. new stuff). The transcriptions are accurate, but not many songs I'd like to learn."
2,too many 'new' Allmans songs,"As a fan of classic Allman Brothers, I found that this book had too many of the 'newer' songs. If you are a diehard Allmans fan or are looking for 'completeness' in your sheet music catalog, this may still be the book for you. However, if you are looking for just their classics, look elsewhere."
2,"Some Good Music, but not made to use",The Allman Brothers Band - The Definitive Collection for Guitar - Volume 1These type of music books are not made to use. You cannot open them (or set them on a music stand) to play the music. The spine on this one broke after about the first hour.Some good music though not as many of the old song as I prefer.
3,"Mildly entertaining, if flawed","As the other reviewer has already mentioned, Rosemary is not convincing as a young woman - she definitely seems as if she is a widow in her fifties, not in her thirties. Also, the authors obviously know a lot about school, but very little about the ministry. They don't even mention whether Rosemary is ordained or not until the book is nearly half over, and it is alluded to in the most casual of ways, and we never know what denomination she is! Ordination to the ministry is a pretty significant event! I've also never heard of a chaplain being called ""Dean,"" but that might have been the case at their schools. Finally, that Rosemary might find one or more love interest in a small college town amused me.The murderer was fairly obvious, to me, at least, and the book was nicely written and entertaining, but I am glad I got it from the library rather than buying it. I'd give it two and a half stars if I could."
5,"I was there, and Carl Nordin's account is right on target!","This is the best account of life as a prioner-of-war that I have ever read. It deals with the day-to-day experiences Carl and I encountered, and it is the first time that anyone has been able to put into writing an account that can be understood by all whether you were there or not. I bought six copies for each of my children because it was so close to my own experience, and they were all very pleased to finally be able to fully understand what I had gone through. Bill Lowe, Riverside, CA"
1,Too short to be very useful...,"Manufacturers description says it can be extended 5' from the card, but the cable is only 40 inches long. It barely reaches from my computer to the top of my desk and it cannot reach to my desired location. It works, but if I had known the cable was so short I would not have bothered to buy it."
1,not worth it,"I bought this to share my internet with my neighbor. It claims up to 300 feet and our computers are probably only 100 ft. apart....TOPS! It didn't help one bit, so I will eat this and buy a different one. Disappointed, doesn't live up to its claims."
2,F5D6900 Wireless antenna for network cards,Antenna came with a slight bend to it. Should have sent it back but used it anyway. Was not in original box. Was supposed to be new. Did not make much difference in signal strength. Went from a 20% signal to 28-30% so it did improve some. This is not the product you need if you realy want to improve signal strength. According to Belkin you need their network access point device F5D7130. Have not tried this yet but plan to if I expand my network.
1,A Hopper of a disappointment,"I ordered an 18"" Hopper ball for my grand daughter as a Christmas present. It turned out to be a great disappointment to her, her parents and me. The ball requires a needle apparatus to fill it with air! The needle pin is also very hard to find! It would have been an easy solution to avoid disappointment to a child on Christmas day: if the company had included either the simple device or specified the requirement of one with the purchase order.L. Haseltine"
2,VL Meyers,"Purchased the 18"" for my grandson and the size is perfect. I was glad I had read the previous reviews that indicated a pump would be needed - and was it ever!. This ball will not hold air. We have to pump it up everytime he wants to use it (which is about every day). He previously had the Ball, Bounce and Sport Ball, Bounce and Sport Cars Hopper and once it was inflated it stayed pumped up - NOT THIS BALL! I gave it five stars for fun and deducted 3 because it will not stay inflated - disappointed!"
4,xmas gift,was a awesome deal my granddaughter had just about out grew her other hippity hoppity ball. This one is larger was a great price too would highly recommend this seller. she is 7 years old
5,the twins loved it !!,I purchased 2 of these hoppers and they arrived almost immediately. I would buy from this company again without any hesitation. Thank-you for such a good transaction. Sheila
4,Good fun for kids of all ages,My daughter aged 4.5 and son 15 months both love playing with this. Daughter hops around and my son sits on it and we bounce him on it and he just loves it. I would have given it 5 stars but it is just that it took us some running around and figuring out to get it inflated. We couldn't use cycle pumps or hand pumps right away. We had to first buy 'Ball inflation needles' that had to be inserted before we used the pump sets and then it was straight forward. We had to go to a couple of a stores to find this out. These needles hardly cost a dollar and I wish the seller includes them or mentions about them so that it saves some trouble for the buyers...otherwise we love it and in fact thinking of buying one for ourselves.
2,Couldn't blow up.,I just had the kids open it today but have to figure out how to inflate. Hopefully when I do it will be a fun activity.
5,Our boys LOVE the Hoppers.,"Once again we bought our two boys (7 and 3) way too much for Christmas. Out of everything we got them though, the Hoppers are what they play with the most. We are very pleased with their construction and durability. I expect my kids to be playing with these for several years. The only thing I would add would be a recommendation that you have a heavy-duty bicycle style pump on hand for inflation. It took us forever to get the right amount of air in them using a small sports ball style pump. It was one of those... ""We should have thought about this..."" but didn't moments!Overall, one of, if not the, best purchases we made this Christmas."
5,18 in Tye Die Hopper,The hopper was an instant hit with my 6 year-old daughter and her friend. The neighborhood kids fight over it. Great purchase.
2,Very top heavy,"This tackle box has a lot of space, but the equipment it comes with sucks! It also is top heavy so when you extend out the trays it falls over and your tackle gets everywere! I threw it out and bought this which I am very happy with.Plano 3500 Size Tackle Box[...]"
4,Great Starter Box,We purchased this tackle box as a starter kit for our son and daughter-in-law. Had many of the basics to hit the lake or river right away!
4,Reflections...,"This book was awesome; I loved how the each story developed and described how relationships can sometimes take a rocky turn. It isn't always love at first sight the end. The women were realistic and allowed you to follow their life with all the crazy turns and events. One of my favorite quotes ""What is meant to be will be"" was shown in this book over and over again. This was my first book from this author and I'm now interested in reading more of her work."
3,mildly amusing,"Let's face it, the term ""fashion genius"" is a contradiction in terms; an oxymoron. But this book is fun in that it has juicey gossip, and shows how much luck was involved in this success story."
1,Poorly written !,"It's such a shame when writers decide to slander/libel/sling mug at their subjects rather than provide the reader with an objective chronology and review of a celebrity's life. I guess it makes the book ""juicier"" and more ""saleable"" to some non-discerning readers. But this is nothing better than one of those grocery-store tabloids."
5,One of the greatest bands ever,"All those so-called rock bands of today (i.e. Third Eye Blind,et al) should send John Easdale and Paul Westerberg checks. Dramarama stole a little from Westerberg's band the Replacements, but they rocked hard and intelligently nonetheless. It is terrible that these guys never got the national attention they deserved. Live, Dramarama tore the roof off, but by the time Hi-Fi cam eout, it was obvious they'd had enough. Always loved them, despite meeting Easdale once and thinking he was a total jerk!"
5,GET READY TO BE MOVED![.],"OK,I have all of Paul's cd's. And when I got this EP, I was blown away! Very FAST![.] SO? if you dont like fast paced music this cd is not for you!"
2,Not that exciting,"Personally I was a bit disappointed with this disc. I really enjoy Paul Van Dyk's work, but franky this was nothing special. If you have his other albums you probably already own a couple of the tracks and the new tracks don't offer anything particularly interesting. If you're a true PVD junkie, then go for it.. However you aren't sure then save your money for The Politics of Dancing -- a much better work."
3,"Hey Paul, can you slow it down a bit?","I picked up this disk on my ride to work. I listened, scanned and was dissapointed by the lack of depth here. OK, I admit that its eurotrance, but it sounds dated to me. After listening to Adam Freeland perpetually for three days straight, this style just doesn't get me off anymore. I found The first Vega remix good, but Vega is one of Paul's best bassline and there is none of that sliipy slow beat here. ALL 4/4 time. Be prepared to cut the bassrange. As after thirty minutes of the same beat it annoys you.Anyway, buy the new Rennaissance release with Nick and Danny."
2,Not that great...,This book should be targeted towards those who have no idea where to get started and are just tossing around ideas. Don't be under the impression that you'll run your business with this book.
3,Half what I expected,Book arrived fast. It was new as I bought new. How-ever book did not go into detail of the amount to charge customers for services rendered. It could have advised at least how to go about that. One of the main things a person needs to know when starting their own business. I rate the book a 50 out of 100.
2,After reading...,"After reading this book, I realized about 20 pages in that the author knew as much about running a janitorial firm, as I did, which is to say, she knew nothing and was writing a book about it. Upon research the author is an accomplished ghost writer, with several titles to her credit, and the book is well written, has a lot of the basic concepts and ideas, and I suppose it is nice for a starting point. However had I researched the author more before I purchased the book, I would not have bought it as her knowledge on the subject is not from experience but is speculation on what she believes the business is."
3,WOW,THIS BOOK IS WHAT IT IS.(IF YOU UNDERSTAND THAT) IT TELLS YOU ALL THAT IS NEEDED TO KNOW ABOUT STARTING YOUR OWN CLEANING SERVICE. I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT I FOUND SO MUCH HELPFUL INFO IN ONE BOOK. IF ONLY ALL BOOKS CAN ASSIST AND DIRECT YOU THE WAY THAT THIS BOOK DOES. IT BREIFLY HITS ALL TYPES OF CLEANING SERVICES.I HAVE LOANED THIS BOOK OUT TO SEVERAL FRIENDS AND FAMILY MEMBERS. THANKS GOODNESS I TOOK IT BACK. IT IS STILL HELPFUL.
5,Insightful and well written,"The book is well organized and clearly written.Mr. Beatie gives a new (and detailed) look at the origins of the Civil War from the Union perspective. The pantheon of Confederate leaders are known to us all, Beatie gives the Union leaders a voice.I found his detailed research, especially as it related to G.B.McCellan particularly insightful. He does not follow the crowd in vilifying McCellan, rather he presents a balanced appraisal of the man-- his many weaknesses as well as his magnetism that drew people to him.I am looking forward to volume two!"
3,"A good book,not a great one","I was somewhat disappointed in this book. Mr. Beatie is a fine researcher, but not a great writer. I didn't like that he quoted verbatim long conversations as they appeared in memoirs many years later. That got a bit old. More paraphrasing would have been preferable.Also, although the examples of history are sometimes useful, I didn't like many of the ""off message"" moments where Beatie talked in detail about how the ancients or Napoleon addressed a particular issue germane to the development of the Army of the Potomac.Also, there are a lot of choppy sentences. The book needed a better edit job.I'm hoping for better from Volume II. The main redemning aspect of Vol. I is that it covers a period rarely examined in this detail. It's good to break some new ground. I just don't think this book did so in a highly effective manner."
3,Interesting but...,"I was surprised to see so many 5 star ratings for this volume. Sections of it were very good, and there was a nice use of unusual sources within text. What was disappointing however was the unevenness of the structure, with chapters jumping between straight narrative and more technical discussions. This did not work for me, and some of the last few chapters detailing the bureau heads, cavalry etc were just plain dreary. Beatie drew attention to his wish to emulate Freeman's Lees Lieutenants, but he needed a tougher editor to keep him focussed on the wood and not the trees."
3,The Sng of Crazy Horse,"I purchased this CD solely for The Song Of Crazy Horse. I enjoy that long, long song but do not truly enjoy the rest of the album"
5,Great,"I had to get the adapters, but the rack is great. I just went on a trip and drove 9 hours pushing 80mph w/ no issues. Great product and would recommend."
4,Thule 517 Bike Rack,"I bought this bike rack for my daughter and she is able to use it without any issues. The install was simple. It holds the bike securly. The 517 offers an adjustable ""quick release"" mechanism that works great and is key for ease of use. You do need the separately offered key/lock assembly; it offers both a level of theft prevention and front clamp retention (equally important)."
2,Average paper,"The only difference between this paper and cheap paper is the watermark. It's definitely not worth the price tag. With a cheap piece of old paper next to one of these ones, it is not easy to identify the expensive one."
2,not that much better,nice paper but not much different then normal paper besides the watermark i would not get it again if i seen it first hand
5,A Divine Blessing for All,"When I picked up Na Mo'oleo Lomilomi at the Bishop Museum in Honolulu, I had no idea what I treat I was in for. As a massage practitioner who works from the heart, it struck every resonant cord in my body. Somehow, after reading this book, I was given permission to take my work to a higher level. The intuition, the knowing, the love just expanded. I so very much appreciate this book and share it with everyone who is interested in this work.Bless you Makana Risser Chai ... you are my Angel.Robin GarrisonMaui, Hawaii"
3,Missing 7mm Piece,"I agree the packaging could be better, its been tolerable as only 2-3 fall out of their places when I open the case. What frustrates me the most is my set didn't come with a 7mm piece. Initially I thought it fell out and was one of the loose pieces in the storage case. But after my first use, there simple is no 7mm socket in my kit. Pretty lame, but too much trouble to replace or take back. Dear Stanley, send me a new 7mm....sorry to dock 2 stars for a good product, but Stanly shouldn't advertise that many pieces if theyre not in the box :)RyanOfficeSignCompany.com"
2,Wait till they're on sale.,"These are OK for light-duty work, but that's it. If you expect better in a hand tool (as I do), a couple dollars more will get you a Craftsman set. You can then run to Sears and get a free replacement if you break something."
4,Quality Tools,"This set has been great for maintenance around the shop. Carrying it on the truck, however, reveals the problems everyone's been having with the case.Given that you can generally adjust most of the sockets to stay firm even when bouncing along on and off road, it's really not such a problem that the case doesn't hold them fast all the time. The biggest hangup is the foam padding ~ I've noticed it tends to get pinched between socket and case, and when it does those are the sockets that pop out.Another reviewer suggested using a sheet of bubble wrap, and that or a sheet of soft foam should take care of the problem entirely."
2,Cool Set - Lousy Storage,The tools themselves are really decent but the storage case was a joke. The sockets kept falling out of the keeps and became impossible to close the case.
4,All the sockets you will need,"This set is very nice, and like everyone says the case is bad at keeping the tools in. To solve this problem I had some bubble wrap laying around, and I put it in the case which fixed that problem. Good tools none the less."
3,Lots of song and a bit overboard in direction,EWF is a fantastic group and they have done so much...great music and voices but this offering is sometimes disparate in a good flow of their catalog.
5,A must have!,"I purchased this box set of CDs in 1993. It is still the best music purchase I have ever made. It has all of the great Earth Wind and Fire songs (to that time) and a couple of live versions and some previously unreleased material. Listening to the live versions brings back memories of the EWF concerts I've been to. The only thing I would change would be to add a few of their songs they have released in the years since this boxed set came out, and some more live material. Get this set and ""Greatest Hits Live""... you deserve the best!"
4,"Missing ""love's Holiday"" and others.....","I love this disc set, however I have to agree with person who said ""Love's Holiday"" was missing. How could they not put that in the collection???? That's like having spaghetti without the sauce. I also would've like if ""Take it to the Sky"", ""Jupiter"", ""On Your Face"" and ""Imagination"" were included in there also. Aside from all of that, this CD set is good to have. It brings you from their early days until about the late 80's, early 90's."
2,MISSING SONGS,"THIS IS NOT A VERY GOOD BOX SET. IT IS MISSING TOO MANY SONGS. HOW CAN THEY LEAVE OFF ""LOVE'S HOLIDAY"" AND ""REASONS(LIVE)."" THEY ALSO LEFT OFF ""LOVE MUSIC"" FROM THEIR THE BEST OF VOL. 1 AND ""TURN ON(THE BEAT BOX)"" OFF OF VOL. 2. THEY DIDN'T PUT THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF ""DEVOTION"" OR ALBUM CUTS LIKE ""FAIR BUT SO UNCOOL,"" ""ALL ABOUT LOVE,"" ""GRATITUDE,"" OR MY FAVORITE ""ON YOUR FACE."" THERE ARE MANY OTHER ALBUM CUTS THAT SHOULD HAVE MADE THIS SET BUT DIDN'T, SO INSTEAD OF THIS BUY THEIR ACTUAL ALBUMS AND YOU WON'T MISS ANY SONGS."
2,A boxed set for the sake of a boxed set,"Those tempted by the ""Eternal Dance"" would be made happier by simply buying ""Best of"" (Vol. I) and ""Gratitude."" The latter is itself a half-studio/half-live catch-all from the pre-boxed set era."
5,shining star for you to see,"love this, fan the fire has a funkadelic vibe love the lyrics it is so apocalptic, i don't have time to explain every song on here but if you love earth, wind, and fire this is definetly for you, elements not only of life, but gospel, rock, blues, africano, hell whatever, some of the greatest funk ever recorded."
5,Excellent Album!!!!!!!!!!!!!,My husband and I love this album. It have alot of major hits on it. He listen to this album all the time
3,Weird,"Okay, let me start by saying that I like The Cheetah Girls movie. I think the story is, although rather unreal, entertaining, and the characters are full of personality. But the book series is just...weird. I mean, the lyrics to the songs the girls are supposed to sing are goofy and retro sounding songs like something about a ""Jiggy Jungle"". The girls pick on each other, and aren't much of friends, if you ask me. They're always hiding things from one another, and being ridiculously insecure.This book was a disappointment. On the back of the book, it talks about the girls making cheetah collars, but that doesn't happen until two chapters until the end! I think them making it sound like this book is all about their cheetah collar buisness is very misleading.Overall, I'd say watch the movie, and don't waste your time on the books."
3,A vision emerging.,"This book was an ambitious attempt to describe both a vision of what personal computing could be and to provide a much needed technical overview of Squeak. Although largely successful, the buyer should be warned that some chapters in this book refer to online software that has yet to be written or is not currently available online. In particular, Alan Kay provides an unintended joke with his forward to the book. He states that Squeak is a ""dynamic medium for creative thought"" and that the foreward to the book should be an online active essay in Squeak. Unfortunately, the essay, ""It Should Be Active, But Where (and When) Will It Be?"" does not yet exist!As Squeak continues to evolve rapidly, this book may become obsolete in a few years, but it currently provides some of the best technical overviews of Squeak's Morphic UI, networking, 3D animation, and other fun topics."
5,My kitchen will become a lab.,I will have to set aside a place on the counter for the girls to use for their oils mixtures and remedies.
2,It's missing an entire section of the book!,I love the book and all but the book is missing pages 36-62 wich is the section for the defusers (the one I really needed ironicly)
5,The title says it all,"This book proved to be exactly what the title said. It provided exact, practical formulas for everyday use. The layout gave very easy to follow recipes for everything from chapped lips to insect repellent. This book should be saved for those with some familiarity of aromatherapy, as it did not offer a great detailed explanation of the practice. As a hands on manual, though, it was excellent!"
3,Not what I expected,It's just going to take up space on my book shelf as I probably won't refer to it much. Really rather disappointing.
2,Just a recipe book,"This thing just has a bunch of recipes, mostly relating to massage. It's not aromatherapy and anyone can make up these recipes."
3,"Many recipes, however, they are for same subjects","This has many recipes. However, it's many for the same subjects. As in ""bathing"", ""messages"", ""spray mist"" with only a few more subjects. I was expecting a wider variety of subjects being this many formulas. Nice book with limits. You are able to get a variety of recipes of what's in this book free off the internet. If you are looking for a mixture of recipes just for bathing, messages or spray mist, then this book is for you. Otherwise, if you are looking for a bigger subject variety, then look elsewhere."
4,Just what I was looking for.,This is just the sort of book I hoped it would be. It has recipes for all occasions and needs but does not get bogged down by a lot of extraneous detail. Great for the amateur to use as an every day reference.
3,Layout leaves much to be desired,"This book is okay, but the layout is bad and often confusing. There are several (up to eight) formulas provided under each general heading without any details regarding the oils being used or differentiating why one formula should be used over rather than another. Overall, the book - while initially looking good - it leaves much to be desired."
4,Nice,"Happy I got this book but a little disappointed that even though it says 500 formulas, most of them only differ by one or two drops of a particular oil. Still a nice addition to my library."
3,Good Reference piece,"This book is good for the person who needs some hands on exp. and needs some recipes to work with. It has alot of wonderful scents, but dont look to this book if you have no idea how oils work. Do some research first then go to this book. I would have gave this book a better score if it would have had more advanced fragrances. Other than that this book is a great addition to the inspiring potion and brew maker. ""wink, wink"". I would recommend this book. Peace and love."
2,"Lots of recipes, but no explanations...","As promised, lots and lots of essential oil recipes for different ailments, beauty needs, et al, but there was no explanation as to why certain oils were used as opposed to others. If you're looking to learn the rhyme and reason as to what oils are best for which situations, this is not the book. It merely provides you with an ingredient list for mixing the authors' preferred recipes."
3,thisdarkplace*blogspot*com,"Typical space opera fare. Set on the planet Krishna, it follows the adventures of Anthony Fallon as he attempts to regain his throne. Not extremely memorable compared to Burrough's Barsoom stories, but a quick fun read."
5,Must have for Mexican coin collectors,"There aren't that many of us Mexican Coin Collectors in the world and the prices don't really change that much. No need to get the latest Krause when this one works just fine. I have the 2003, 2004 and 2005. It's small enough to carry to coin stores and shows. I've even seen a few dealers cut off the US and Canada portions for convenience.The good thing about the 2004 is that they went to alphabetical on the Mint listing. If you've used an earlier one to look up prices on 8 reales coins, you know why that's a good thing. A small quibble with the 2005 is the breaking out of the Cap & Ray pesos to different pages.All in all, the 2004 was the best for Mexican."
5,Thought you couldn't grasp Deuteronomy. Read this!,"Warren Weirsbie is one of the premier Bible teachers of the day. His strength (as always) is his ability to outline this book into understandable, manageable sub-parts. Whether you have studied the Bible for a long time or are new to it, this book will be of benefit to you. His knowledge of the Scriptures is presented in a manner that makes you WANT to study. Not many can do that. This book is a wonderful read and a great took for anyone's library"
4,Great price,"Needed this book for our SS class study. However, it wasn't described as an older edition, therefore my page numbers don't match with the rest of my classmates. One of Wiersbe's better books."
1,A misleading and disappointing waste of money for those 10+,"This is a children's book, not a ""look behind the creation of the series."" Do not buy this book for anyone over 10. This is the bad part about buying from Amazon. Not only is this a kid's book, but it is a BAD kids book. It resembles, in every characteristic, a bagain bin/dollar store overstock. As a matter of fact, if you are interested in it at all, please look in those outlets before shelling out $21 (shipping included) to Amazon. John Starr"
1,I would have given it 0 if I could,"Bad, bad, bad, bad. First of all, for those who actually read the original book and not just saw the movie, or musical, there are so many errors to count. There was no burning of an opera house, he didn't walk through a mirror and he didn't live at the end. Oh, and the little thing about a full, black mask, not a half of one. And it was the Paris Opera House, not the l'Opera Populaire, or however she mutliated the French in this. And, he wasn't Scottish.If you really want to read a good book, find Susan Kay's wonderful ""Phantom"". It gives you the life of Erik, and makes you like the charecter far more than this book does."
1,Don't Bother,"Now usually I can be forgiving of various plot descrepencies and even a few characters acting... well, out of character, but this was beyond tolerable. I managed to get through 5 chapters before I had to put it down. It is riddled with errors! In some instances the author seems to enjoy throwing commas into random places where they are completely unnecessary, while in others the sentences are so long and run-on that by the time you reach the end you forget what the point was. Obviously there was no editor in place, and if their was they should seriously consider a career change.And I have yet to mention the so-called ""plot"". It is so beyond unbelievable that I was physical unable to finish. I have read poor Phantom stories before but I always force myself to finish, if for no other reason than to give the work a fair chance. In this instance I was unable to.Uness you have a collection that is incomplete without every piece of Phantom work, do yourself a favor and pass on this."
2,darkness and the dawn,"This is trite and shallow, with contrived plot and no dimension of the charactes involved. The writing is without feel or passion, and if this is romance, then that was lost somewhere between the author's vision and the paper. Erik has no spark, and if the author based him on Gerry Butler's portrayal, then I recommend she see the film again. Erik does not have black hair, that is a wig! I doubt very much that any man with broken ribs and a torn arm would be up to anything, much less hanky-panky! A little reality please, even if it is a romance! And a reminder to aspiring authors; an epiloque is at most three pages-NOT 60!"
1,Bad experience,"The Southworth Credentials Collection 24 lb. watermarked 25% cotton antique laid paper and accompanying envelopes are supposed to be okay for laser printers. However, when I used them the ink did not adhere well, so I ended with partial letters and numbers. My high-quality Brother MFC-7420 printer prints just fine on other types of paper, so that tells me that it's not my printer but the quality of the paper."
1,Auto Focus Defective!!,"The Auto focus was malfunctioning. It take pictures most of the time. But in some situations, it does not take the picture how much ever you press the shutter. (I returned mine)The zoom buttons should be designed away from the shutter."
2,Mine turned out to be defective,"Got this over a Fuji as it was a little cheaper. Nice camera took great pictures. The Auto focus (i think) was malfunctioning. It take pictures most of the time. But in some situations, it does not take the picture how much ever you press the shutter. There was no particular scene it refused to shoot. Once in a while, it refuses to fire. Returned it.Also, very easy to scratch. mine had 3 scratches in less than a month and I am careful with the camera.The zooom buttons should be designed away from the shutter."
1,Will not buy from this seller again,"Samsung Maxima 105 GL QD Zoom Date 35mm CameraThe order was diff. than it is shown, Camera dose not function at all, the camera is has marks all over, it is very old.seller dose not respond at all to the emails.I give it a 0 for services, and item the sold"
2,Auto Focus Defective,"The Auto focus was malfunctioning. It take pictures most of the time. But in some situations, it does not take the picture how much ever you press the shutter.(I returned mine)The zoom buttons should be designed away from the shutter."

2,Problem with Ink,"The balls are well-weighted and the travel case is nice, but the colors rub off on your clothes and hands - very messy and impossible to clean."
5,great product,"I also try to use this product at least twice a year, always with excellent results.. best product I have tried, always look forward to using it. I do however recomment detoxing while you are on break just because you are often visiting the restroom. Follow the recommendations and you will feel like a new person. Love it! PS I have tried a detox from this same product line for a lower price but was disatisfied.. CleanStart is well worth the money you spend for it."
5,Love This Cleanse,"I've been doing this 2 week cleanse religiously at least twice a year now for years, on the recommendation of my homeopath. I love how much improved my skin is after doing the cleanse, not to mention the loss of inches on the waistline. Good price on Amazon and fast shipping."
4,Smooth Transaction,"No hitches. Recieved item in an timely manner. There is highlighting that was not disclosed in the descprition or else I would have chosen a different vendor. But otherwise, I am satisfied with my purchase."
3,Not too bad for the price...,These earings are okay but I have trouble putting them on due to one of the clasps being alot longer than the other. One is almost too short while the other is so long its hard to get it into the hole to clasp.
1,Cleans .. but streaks like crazy,"PROS: CleansCONS: Streaks like smearing gel on your TV ! .. awfulEven with a micro fiber cloth .. I cannot remove the streaks?Don't even consider buying if your TV is any kind of sunlit room.After giving up on this, went back to Sparkle and a micro fiber cloth .. and tada ! streak free .. perfect again.Don't get suckered into buying this junk."
1,Save your money!!!,"Seriously i really don't understand why this garbage works with some users but a disaster with other(i'm one of them!!) I use it correctly with my LCD TV and it's not hard:i wait when the tv is cooled down,i spray the product on the microfiber cloth,i clean the screen and use the dry side at the end.When i finished the tv looks like new at 3-4 feets away but use a flashlight and illuminates the tv closer.... before to use it my tv was dirty but after it's 1000 times worse my screen is full of streaks!!!you cannot imagine how it is dirtier than before.....Don't buy this......."
1,Use this if you like ruining your tv or pc monitor.,"This stuff is absolute garbage. It is so smudgy and cheap that it completely wrecked my Asus monitor. It left a permanent smudge on my monitor that will not come off no matter how much compound is used. Like all overhyped monster junk, avoid this like the plague."
1,Garbage,"This product does exactly the opposite of what it is supposed to do: It is supposed to clean screens. Instead, it leaves heavy streaks that are nearly impossible to get rid of. Isn't that the definition of a bad product? The people giving this product positive reviews are either paid shills or blind. Stay away at all costs. You've been warned."
2,Still Streaks,"After using a store bought ""screen wipe"" I went to this hoping to eliminate streaking on my Sony LCD, no such luck.After reading other's experiences I'm going with distilled water with a small part of alcohol."
3,Lack of info,The advertisement said for plasma screens. The instructions said only if recomended by tv mfg.
1,Monster is garbage,Overpriced piece of junk like the Monster brand.Leaves horrible streaks on your LCD. Follow the instructions to make sure your LCD is cool and hasn't been on in a while. Still leaves streaks. Take a good flash light to your LCD and see the horrid streaks left behind.Check out monoprice for a great cleaner at a fraction of the cost.Cheers
5,Works very well,"I've only had this product for a month, but, it works very well. There is probably a home brew that could be made for pennies instead of dollars, but, I was taking a chance on my $2K plasma.No streaking, wipes dry with provided cloth.Great product at a reasonable price."
5,HDTV screen saver,"This product from Monster does a great job on any HDTV, the cloth is soft and durable, a great product."
4,Descent Product,Works great on my Plasma and LCD screens. Leaves tons of streaks on my DLP television. Haven't been able to get a good cleaning on the DLP yet with this product. I only have one DLP screen so I can't complain too much since it works on the rest of the televisions and computer/laptop monitors around the house.
5,"Surprised, it actually works!","My father in-law used this item on his 32"" Panasonic TV, I was very surprised to see it cleaned the screen very nicely. I was very skeptical using any kind of liquid on my 42"" Plasma or LCD monitors. I purchased this cleaner, used it on my 42"" Plasma, 20"" Dell LCD, 15.4"" Dell Studio laptop, 17"" Dell laptop, I was not disappointed, it cleaned the screens flawlessly back to a shine. I sprayed the solution on the microfiber cloth which I used the entire time. I saw no small fibers coming off of the cloth as other reviewers stated. I thought the price was kind of high but it will last for years with the small amount needed to clean the screen."
4,"Good, as long as you rinse.","This is a great cleaner, but make sure you have a separate spray container of plain ole water for follow up rinse.Here's what I do for my 50"" Samsung Plasma.Turn it off for a good 15 minutes. The heat will dry the stuff to fast, and prevent you from being able to apply it properly.Spray, generously half the screen with the Monster cleaner, and wipe as you would cleaning any other glass surface. Don't worry about the rainbow-like streaks for now. Repeat to the other half. Let sit for about a minute or two.Spray plain ole water down generously to the whole screen. Using a different towel (I use shamwows- but it'd be nice if the kit came with two of the those microfibers. I've since lost mine, but it's no biggie) wipe off the water, and the rainbowy streaks will come right up, and the screen will be super super clean. You MIGHT have to rinse twice, but not likely.Recap, I give 4 stars because the kit should have 2 towels, and instructions to rinse with water."
4,Good deal,Cheap severed its propose and most likely I will buy the product again. It cleaned up both my LCD screens on my notebook and all my TV screens.
1,Permanent Streaks,"We were recommended this product by Best Buy for our new LCD TV. I ""tested"" it on my laptop...it worked great! Then I used it on my desktop...not so good. Permanent streaks! After reading all the other reviews from those having the same problem, there is NO WAY I am putting this stuff on my LCD TV. I can't believe I spent $20 on this crap! I will be returning it and trying some of the remedies recommended here...plain water or OptiMist Prime. Monster CleanScreen should be taken off the shelf, it's not worth the risk."
2,Those Damn Streaks,"I was recommended this product by a friend and when i tried it on my 47"" Samsung LCD 1080P I was not all impressed. It leaves streaks where you wipe the product with the microfiber towel. Cool! I would rather have dust then streaks. Many say you can get the streaks gone if u continuously wipe forever, guess i will try that. Also the solution isn't blue...WTF the plastic bottle lies to you, hehe..."
3,Word of CAUTION,"I bought this product planning to use it to clean my SXRD rear projection TV. Upon opening the package I found a yellow notice that states:""To avoid potential damage to the products you plan to clean, please consult your product owner's manual(s) first regarding display care and cleaning procedures and recommendations prior to using this product.If the product to be clean stipulates 'soap and water' cleaning only or recommends that no cleaners be used on your product, do not use this cleaner as a cleaning method. You may return your purchase to authorized Monster dealer, if necessary.""Just to safe, I checked the owners manual for my TV and sure enough, it stated use mild soap and water only. This product has been repacked to be returned. It would have been nice if this notice was on the back of the package rather than stuck inside of it."
2,"Great rag, bad streaks!","This is the first review I have left on Amazon. I use the site (and reviews) so often that I thought I should give back. I have a beautiful new Samsung 650 LCD and wanted to buy the best for cleaning. After reading the great reviews I tried this product. After spreading on the entire screen and wiping off I noticed what another reviewer noticed, lots of streaks. These were not your ordinary streaks, they were on there good (or bad). I rubbed and rubbed all the while worrying about hurting my screen. Finally I went over it with another (non-Monster) product called CleanScreen that came with some cables I bought. This seems to have helped with the streaks but buyers beware...if you have a newer Samsung you will be very frustrated with the results. This stuff is getting shipped back tomorrow. This is one disappointed customer!!!"
2,Very expensive cleaner - would not buy again,"This is easy to use, but really way to expensive for a screen cleaner. I would not purchase it again."
3,Screen Cleaner,"Love it great for the screen. Use it on TV, phone, pads and computer. Does a great job. It's really great."
2,This is the best on the market huh?,"If this is the best of the best.....well then theres a problem. I own a 50 inch Plasma, as well as a few LCDs. This product FAILED terribly on them all. Cleaning a screen becomes a major process with this product, and you better bring your patience with ya . Basically this is not a cleaner, it is a polishing cleaner. As many other reviewers have stated you have to polish a section over, and over....,and over to get get rid of the streaks of doom . Hahaha. Unless your screen is extremely dirty dont even bother with this. You will get frustrated, and its not worth it. On the positive side though, if you have a really dirty screen ,this product will work. You just better be ready for the job its going to take to get there."
5,Monster ScreenClean works!,I can make this a very short review and get right to the point - This product works great on my Samsung HD LCD.
5,Worth the money,"A little expensive, but if you care about your electronics it is well worth the money. I have used it a couple of times so far on my LCD tv and am pleased with the product. No streaks, no marks. Only a nice clean screen."
5,Does the job.,"Monster ScreenClean is a bit expensive,but it works quite well, removing fingerprints and those smudges of unknown origin quickly and easily. The bottle holds 200 mL, so I expect it will last a very long time. Recommended for all those expensive flat panels."
2,Good and Bad,I bought this so I could take the glass cover of my iMac LCD and clean underneath because some tap water got under there and left some residue. So after cleaning with the solution and provided cloth I saw how many hundreds of tiny fibers it left behind. So after cleaning with the solution and the cloth I used the non-fibrous rag provided from apple. It was able to get rid of 90% off the fibers and clean the mineral deposits.I would recommend that you use the solution with the provided rag then clean it off with a better quality rag...
3,"Good, not amazing","Given, some of the other reviews here - I thought this stuff was a miracle worker. In reality, it took care of fingerprints and other obvious dirt, but it left streaks. I tried up and down motion which most people say to use and then circular motion which the box says, but I still had streaks.I prefer the streaks to the dirt and fingerprints, though. So I'm glad I used it. I also believe it is probably safe to use on expensive screens - I don't think it caused any damage. And you can't see the streaks when the TV is on."
1,Use Powglass instead!!!!!!!!!,Like many others I have tried the product and got stuck with these ugly looking streaks. One of my buddies recommended the new Powglass. I absolutely love it. It does my mirrors and electronics with spectacular results. Finally.
5,nice,"I got this based on the reviews of this site. I had bought an LCD cleaner from Wal-Mart before and all it did was streak. So I was hoping this stuff would be a lot better. I bought it mainly for my tv because I wanted something that would be good. So I decided to use my laptop as the test subject. I sprayed the screen and started wiping and instantly you could tell this stuff worked. I cleaned my entire screen and was very pleased. In fact it hasn't been this clean since I got it. No streaks, looks new. This stuff works great."
2,Meh.,"I mean, SURE the screens look nice and sparkly now, but here's what I didn't like.1) See the picture there? Two towels are in the photo. It only ships with one. Whatever.2) See that fancy lid on the spray bottle that extends the width of the bottle? That was not in my package for some reason.3) While it does clean, it DOES NOT REMOVE INK! The main reason I bought ""the best"" is because I thought it would remove the ink pen marks that my loving and sweet daughter so graciously put on my new 20.5"" LCD. It doesn't.While I really didn't like those things, it did make my IBM and my wife's Mac laptop displays look supa clean!"
5,"Easy, Fast, Clean","I used this product on my 50"" t.v., Dell computer screen and a laptop. All were cleaned with little effort. Streak free and very easy to use. If your screens don't get touched very often the bottle should last a very long time. Product lives up to the Monster name."
5,My LCD TV looks new!,"I was VERY pleased with this product when I used it on my Sony LCD TV. Even though the product is advertised as ""dripless,"" I sprayed it directly on the cloth and then used it to gently wipe the TV screen. I was amazed at the results! My kids touch the screen -- no matter how many times I remind them not to -- dog hair and dust seem to be attracted to it, and yet this cleaner wiped it all away! I then used the cleaner on my scanner, an flat panel computer monitor and my son's laptop screen. In each case it did a fantastic job. I would definitely recommend this cleaner."
1,Overpriced Junk,I bought this and 3I other cleaners to clean a large mirror on one of my pieces of lab equipment (goniophotometer). This product put large smears on my mirror despite following the dorections on the bottle. This was also the most expensive product of the three. A cheaper no name foaming cleaner did a much better and even cleaned the smears from the Monster Screen Clean. This will be sitting my shelf or getting thrown away.
1,Worst ever. Dont buy.,"I recently bought a new dell xps computer laptop, it had some loose dirt on it so i decided to put this product to use. IT SCREWED UP MY LAPTOP SCREEN! It has streaks everywhere it didnt clean anything the contrary it messed everything up. If the purpuse of this product was to mess up your screen id give it 5 stars. I will also send a formal complaint against this product."
2,A little streaky,The Monster screen cleaner works great on my PC monitors but on my new Samsung LED LCD it leaves horrible streaks. It must be because of the gloss finish to the screen but after spraying it down and wiping the screen I've noticed rainbow colored streaks all over. It easily take 4x the amount of wiping down to get rid of the streaks compared to quick wipe-down of my PC monitors.
1,Takashi Miike - Love Him or Hate Him,"It seems people have very strong feelings about the Japanese director Takashi Miike. I'm of the camp who believes he's brilliant, but after viewing this I'm beginning to have my doubts.A female secret service member infiltrates a Lady's Pro Wrestling Team to try and bring down a woman who is using her womanly ways (and then some, if you know Miike) to gain power and corrupt government officials.It has some interesting fight scenes that are kind of ninja-esque, but I almost cried the whole way through -- it's that* bad*. If you want to see Miike in full form, purchase Ichi the Killer which will establish you as a Miike lover or haterist. However, no matter how* much* you like* Miike, do not get withing seeing distance of this film. If I could unwatch one film, it would be this one. It's that* bad."
5,coffeecoffee,This is a really cool little coffee pot. It's just enough coffee for two and stays warm a while!
3,Leave Before The Lights Come On,"""Leave Before The Lights Come On"" was the first release after Arctic Monkey's extremely popular debut album, Whatever You Say I Am, That's What I'm Not. The song itself doesn't quite sound like anything on the album, but more so than the two b-sides that were included with the single, ""Put Your Dukes Up John"" and a cover of Barbara Lewis' 1965 hit ""Baby I'm Yours."" If you're really into the band I'm sure you'd really appreciate these songs, but if you haven't heard either of their full-length albums, don't judge them by these songs. The songs all seem light, friendly, and even somewhat soft, words I wouldn't normally use to describe the band. I'm not trying to make this a completely negative review because quite honestly, these songs are not bad. What I'm trying to say is that you may be surprised by the way they sound if you're used to hearing songs like ""When The Sun Goes Down"" and ""I Bet You Look Good On The Dance Floor."""
4,useful,This book contains lots of worksheets. I like how it focuses on the day to day aspects of a career instead of just telling you information about different careers. It helps guide you towards finding something on your own rather than making suggestions. Maybe a good graduation present.
3,Lousy Red Eye Reduction,"I like this camera. Compact and easy to use, but unfortunately, the red eye reduction doesn't work for beans. I have two little girls with blonde hair and blue eyes, and they always end up with red red eyes... other than that, super camera! If you're mostly shooting landscapes or brown eyed individuals (my eldest brown hair brown eyed daughter always looks super) than this is an awesome camera for the money! No other complaints than the red eye issue!"
4,Made in china = low casing quality,The camera works nice but its battery costs about $5 and its casing exterior quality feels like cheap plastic .. thats how you can get a $150 camera for $30 .. i wonder what was compromised !!
1,DO NOT BUY!! ITS JUNK!!,I purchased this camera and as soon as it got here I put a CR2 battery in it and set the date. Next thing I did was load it with Kodak 400 speed 35MM film and I pushed the on/off button and it did nothing! I am going to return it to Adorama camera and get my money back. I have no complaints with Adorama camera because they shipped it super quick and it is not their fault that Samsung makes junky products. I have had similar experiences with a Samsung VCR so I was reluctant to purchase this camera. DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA! IT IS A PIECE OF JUNK!
4,"""Nightfall"" brings Somalia to life","""Nightfall in Mogadishu"" is a real page-turner that puts the reader behind the scenes of third world politics and the international aid game at a time of crisis and chaos. Those who knew Somalia in the 90's will recognize it; those who don't are in for an eye-opener. Either way you will feel like you are there, with undercover CIA operative Susan Chen, trying to stay alive and make sense of it all as the country collapses around you. Veronica Li brings a unique perspective to this story of a troubled country at a troubled time. Only someone who lived it could write it so well."
4,Spy thriller in Somalia,"The story is set in the year 1990, just at the time that Somalia began its disintegration into anarchy and chaos. It is an ideal backdrop for an adventure tale with non-stop action. There is plenty of murder and mayhem not to mention evil, corruption and a little sex thrown in for good measure. Li's knowledge of Somalia shows in the vivid and memorable images she draws of this hot and arid land and its long-suffering people. Her characters, too, are sharply drawn. She seems to have a special touch with villains--they are characters you love to hate. But she captures, too, the courage and warmth of the Somali people as well as the commitment and basic decency of those who have tried, however unsuccessfully, to help them."
4,Good XBOX related stocking stuffer,"This is a well written collection of XBOX hacks, tips, tricks and recommendation. There are game recommendations, pointers to hardware, and advice on how to hook it up and hack it. It's fairly current as of late 2004, but the information about the games will stale rapidly as 2005 starts up. There is some excellent information here on network setup and XBOX live.This is a good additional gift for someone getting their first XBOX for the holidays."
2,"Simple story, Simply told","I heard about this book on NPR as the author was being interviewed about an astounding game winning pass he caught in the final seconds of high school football game.The book is short and I read it as others did in one sitting. Unlike other reviewers I found this book to be simple and predictable. A nice story here for a teenager but no great literature and not even a good ""summer read."" Maybe grist for a formulaic feel good movie.Not worth the $12 I spent."
5,"timely, rich and relevant","Don Stancavish's ""The Pass"" paints in vivid detail the complex relationship between man's capacity for humane and inhumane treatment of fellow man. This relationship has a timliness and relevance which allows the reader a creeping sense of perspective in today's world of escalating religious bigotry and heinous acts of terrorism. The plush, rich prose places me so close to rural New Jersey in the fall I can smell the leaves as they decay under a steel gray sky. Apart from a few minor technical details of anatomy and pathology, the book is flawlessly written and describes well the current state of life, and football fanaticism, in small-town America. I anticipate the next offering from Mr. Stancavish."
5,Writing chart,This chart tablet came in record time. It was also in excellent condition too. I shouldn't have wondered if it would come folded. The company (free shipping) sent this in the largest box ever! I was afraid I wouldn't get the box through my doorway. I believe it was as big as a refrigerator except it felt like there was nothing in it lol! I would order from them again.
2,Poor Packaging and Unacceptable form,"I have used this brand of tablets in my classroom for a few years. However, I usually purchased them from a local teacher supply store. I have since moved overseas and we rely on Amazon for quite a few supplies because Germany just doesn't have what we're used to using. This tablet was shipped poorly and the box arrived crushed and opened and the tablet inside was bent and torn. I have done one activity with my son on this tablet before hanging the tablet on the wall. When I went to hang the tablet on the wall the back cardboard along with several sheets of paper just fell from the tablet. I tried to rethread the paper through the prongs but it would not cooperate. Like mentioned, I have loved using the tablets for a few years but this one that was sent from Amazon is in unacceptable form."
3,"Being lined, it suited my purposes.","Teaching kindergarten, having lined chart paper is a must! It's a good size but a little difficult to rip sheets off."
4,Love it already!,"It has only been three days, although I cannot see any changes in my skin as of yet I can give an initial review on it.The cream looks like yogurt! It's pink and soft and it holds itself together like jello! It smells really nice as well. A lot goes a long way when applying this cream. It glides on the skin like oil and absorbs as you rub it in. My skin feels soft afterwards without a greasy look. Hopefully in 2 weeks I see a difference. I'm a African American male living in the harsh environmental conditions of Bangladesh with acne prone skin."
3,exercises in helping skills workbook 7th edition,The work book was in good shape. No torn pages. It did have more writing in it then I anticipated.
4,Battery backup,"Received 2, separate batteries that needed to be linked together in order to replace the APC original, which was also comprised of 2 batteries, but had been packaged together as a single assembly. Once I got the batteries hooked up and installed, the APC UPS seemed to be happy with them, but it would have been nice to know exactly what was being offered up front.Cost (significantly less than an ""official"" APC replacement) and delivery time were fine."
1,Be sure to check your battery dimensions before ordering!,"The original APC #35 battery measures 2.324"" high, 5.247"" long and 2.601 wide. If the replacement battery does not match these dimensions, it WILL NOT FIT!"
1,ID Vault not Compatible with Windows Vista.,"I cannot use the ID Vault because the company that makes it has not upgraded the product to be used with windows ""Vista"". This information isn't posted anywhere for the consumer to know this.Therefore, I can't comment on the product because I have windows vista and cannot use it.Kalimah Whitehead"
1,Super Glue Gel .07 ounces (6 pack),"This is advertized as .07 ounces super glue gel (6 pack)for $1.81. I ordered two, expecting to receive 12 packs of super glue gel. Instead, my order came today, and I only received two packs of super glue gel. This is very deceiving. I am very disappointed."
3,"Nice Glue, Cheap Applicator","The gel glue works well, but the little applicator doesn't have a screw on cap. This caused me to put just a little pressure on the sides of the tube while trying to cap it and it squirted glue into the cap making a mess out of super glue (which is something you really don't want to make a mess out of). Not a very good design. Also it seems like the gel takes a little longer to dry then the normal super glue."
3,Not the absolute authority...,"I was very dissapointed in this work. The project for which this book was purchased was a block basement and concrete foundation for a new home in southern California. I had hoped that there would be some help in developing techniques and other practical helps. This book was inadequate in these areas. I also discovered that the estimation formulas were inconsistent and inacurate for the project I used it on. I'm sure that this book is applicable in some areas of the country but not in the desert southwest. I also discovered that some of the materials and suggestions are unheard of by professionals in my area (like ""Bitumen Modified Urethane""). I would not recommend purchasing this book unless there is no other alternative."
5,Blown Away,I was completely blown away by the vocal talents of this amazing artist. She sings so beautifuly it makes me want to cry. I have not yet had the chance to see her in concert but i wait for the day.
4,Self awareness revealed in Keyspeech,"This book covers everything from: goal setting,visualization exercises & affirmations to detox cleansing!The subject matter is clear & concise, however I was expecting contents which covered speech patterns more fully because of the book's title - my fault, not the authors!"
3,Not for strength training,"I bought this band to specifically work some of my less used leg muscles (I am a runner). The band worked fine for awhile, but split apart after just a few months. My advice to any runners out there contemplating this device: buy a jump rope instead or finish your runs by running backward for a quarter mile or so. Climb steps, ride a bike. But don't bother with this rather wimpy band unless you don't mind buying half a dozen of them a year. The muscle man you see in the ad would rip this band apart in a few weeks."
1,Rip Off,"i purchased what ""appeared"" to be a case of pantiliners. says there are 30 each. however, there are 42 pantiliners in the box. given the unusually high price of the item, $15.95, i assumed they meant a case of 30 boxes. i am very angry and, given the fact that i purchase a lot on amazon, i am appalled at the deliberate misrepresentation of an item. i want to return this item as i did not purchase a single box of pantiliners. please advise on how to do so. i would hate to have to contact my credit card company to do a chargeback.this persons reply to my unsatisfied complaint & request for a refund was:good luck to you, sorry but when was the last time you bought napkins for 50 cents a box, unless they were used.....given the fact that this same seller sells Always Pantiliner, Thong, 42-Count Packages (Pack of 8) by Always for $14.02 and my single box cost $15.95..... wouldn't anyone agree that this seller is deliberately trying to rip consumers off by misleading this product?!!!"
3,"enticing language, lame story line","Jane Austen uses beautiful language to entice the reader, but the story itself is very boring to a woman living in the year 1999."
3,Quality must vary,"My 21-month old son really likes to play with this. However, despite the glowing reviews by other people, the suction cups on our set are quite flimsy and I am constantly having to put the pieces back up, even when they haven't been touched. They are so thin, that if you push them up against the wall too hard, they invert themselves and don't stick at all.The concept is great and my son really does love to pour the water through the little toy system, but be aware that you may have to restick the set you buy to the wall frequently."
4,Almost Perfect!,"I love being able to configure this in any way you want. . my one year old son likes trying to learn how to pour water. . and the suction cups really hold well!The only con is that we really don't use the monkey part of the toy since the wheel that turns the eyes gets stuck frequently. Also because of our particular space constraints, we put the monkey face seperate from the rest of the toys."
1,it doesn't stick to the wall,"The idea is great and fun, but the for some reason the suction cups do not stick to the wall; so this bug makes all the fun go away;"
5,Kid loves it,"I got this because my 2 year old loves things that spin around. For once I picked a toy that he loved right away - he spends most of his bath time pouring water on it, or asking us to do it. The suction cups stay well on our tiled walls. The monkey wheel doesn't turn as easily as I'd like, but it works well enough."
4,Highly popular toy,"I bought this for my two-year-old niece, and I hear it is a HUGE HIT! Her mom says she loves it, can't wait to get into the tub, and stays a lot longer. She's endlessly fascinated by the movements when she pours water into the top. Seems kind of fragile, however, and may break sooner rather than later. And it's not all that educational, except that it does show some basic cause-and-effect action."
4,Jungle Waterfall,"I bought this for my 6 y/o as she LOVES her bath time, she has fun with it, even though its probably aimed more @ 3-5 y/o. It definitely gets her little brain thinking about placing the pieces in the right order and right place to get it to work properly. Keep in mind that for younger children you may have to set it up for them because it can be tricky to get the flow right, but they will enjoy pouring the water through the top and watching it ""waterfall"" down."
4,Neat Bath Toy,"I purchased this toy about 3 months ago and we still have fun with it at bath time. We have not had any problems with the suction cups. My 15 month old son pulls on them and they don't break free. We love to continually change the order of the toys so it's always new and exciting. At the same time, my son is learning about gravity and cause & effect. My only compaint is that wheel inside the orange monkey in our set is very tough to turn so when the water hits it, it only turns a little and then stops. But my son doesn't care and still has tons of fun with it!"
3,My granddaughter loves it but her mom isn't too pleased!,"I bought this bath toy for my granddaughter; when it finally arrived, my granddaughter was anxious to try it out. My daughter fixed a bath for her and tried to help set it up but it was difficult to get lined up just right to get all the effects of the bath toy. My granddaughter loved it anyway - she just couldn't get all the ins and outs of the bath toy with the noises and whatever it does."
2,Gets old quick!,"Toy is fun, makes bath time a little more interesting but it is hard for my child to reach the top so he can pour the water in. Would return if I could."
5,cute bath toy,"Both my 3yr old and 16 month old love this toy. They get to pour the water and make things happen. Sometimes they need help lining everything up, but thats ok. We have not had any trouble with the suction cups."
3,Alex toys jungle,"This toy comes apart with little pieces that are dangerous to small children. It was hard yo set up. It was packaged well, the 5 year old has more fun with it., the 21 month old disassembles it into small parts."
3,good for 40 day but then started getting a rash throughout the body...,"I loved this product and was promoting it like crazy until after two months taking it I started getting a reaction in my face and extremities mostly my elbows and arms. It seems like after a five day period of taking the vitamin I need to take a break and stop taking it for a couple of days....I am very sorry because I had never had a vitamin that really worked so well in my energy level, nails, hair, mood enhancer... I thought it was the best thing ever.. I guess too good to be true!"
5,A favorite read-aloud in our school library!,"""The Library Dragon"" is one of a handful of titles that I read EVERY YEAR in our elementary school library. It is read at the beginning of each school year to first, second and third graders (and they never get tired of it).While it is delightful, spellbinding story, my motives go beyond entertaining the kids. This hilarious tale is an excellent way to discuss proper care of library books. After all, my students don't want to see me, their librarian, turn into a fire-breathing DRAGON!By the time the students reach third grade, I have them begin to look for the puns and plays on words pertaining to fire, heat and smoke. Author/illustrator Carmen Agra Deedy got all ""fired up"" with her ""burning"" sense of humor. To introduce the concept of puns, we make comparisons to the Amelia Bedelia books, that they already know and love so well."
4,It was about a dragon who was hired to guard the library.,"I think that all ages up to fifth grade would like this book because it is very interesting.I especially think that the upper grades should read it because there are words which are very difficult to understand. The book is about a dragon who is hired to guard the library. She replaced all the old books with brand new books. Her name was Miss Lota Scales. The children were not allowed to take any books off the shelves because the books were only on display. One day a little girl lost her glasses on the floor and ran into the shelf. A book fell on her lap. She put the book to her face and started to read it. Kids from all over the school were there to hear her read. It was just like storytime. Then Miss Scales took the book and began to read it. While she was reading, her scales came off. When all her scales were gone, she was a very nice person."
5,Bravo,As a writer and poet I am acquainted with both Bob and Karen and hold them in very high reguard as the very capable poets that they are. Karen is amazing in her ability to write in any style of poetry in a penetrating and heartfelt way. I would compare Karen's writing skills favorably with any poet I have every read.
5,Beyond Ambergris is Beyond Wonderful!,"This is one of those books that starts out slow, but actually winds up sucking you in until you just can't put it down. The main characters become like friends (or maybe they will remind you of someone you already know). I loved the way the heroine quietly wove the strands of her faith through the lives of the people she loved to prove to everyone, readers included, that miracles do happen, every day. Please, do yourself a favor and read this book. You won't be disappointed."
5,A Timeless Story,"This is an extraordinary story of friendship, love, and faith. The power of one human being on another is carefully portrayed throughout the book. I could not help but become obsessed with reading just one more chapter."
5,a masterpiece of 60's folk singing,"Kudos to the folks at Rhino Records for putting out this wonderful collection of songs from the 60's most underrated folk songer. As Ochs himself once said, ""Fifty Phil Ochs fans can't be wrong."" Seriously, this a wonderful anthology. My only criticism: how could anyone make a compilation of the best of Phil Ochs and ignore his hauntingly beautiful and deeply disturbing masterpiece ""When In Rome""?"
2,The War Is Over,"Phil Ochs felt that he had a heated rivalry with Bob Dylan over who was the better folk singer, and made several digs at Dylan in his songs (notably ""Ringing of Revolution""). One listen to this box set will answer definitively whom the King of the Folksinger is-- Bob Dylan. Ochs had a few highs, like the superb ""I Ain't Marching Anymore,"" but none of his songs had the initial popularity, staying power or cultural relevance that Dylan's did and continue to have. The Disc is valuable in highlighting the decline of the man-- the final songs on the third disc show how far into the bottle Ochs had climbed. When he finally killed himself because he couldn't get out of Dylan's shadow, he was all used up -- his best songs were well behind him and there weren't enough of those to keep people thinking about him."
1,Access Genesis DANGER,These get very hot from the 35 watt halogen bulb inside that long narrow glass tube. I bought three for over my sink and one of the glass shades exploded into a million shards one day out of the blue. ( It had been on about two hours). I called Access Lighting and they did not seem interested. They did not even offer to replace the shade. Scary. They are also impossible to clean. I am going to switch them out for something safer.
2,takes patience,"I did end up getting this to work! I'm glad because it's small and easy to take with me. Works easily while charging.I made sure I read compatibility for this as I switched to Mac. This mouse doesn't work with OSX. I even went to Anycom's website to update drivers, but there aren't any. I can't say how it works for Windows, but stinks for Mac. Is very well designed and well fit for my small hands....too bad."
2,Only so so stories,"I read rave reviews of Benchley's books and bought one. A big disappointment. Perhaps the stories are too American for an European or they are not pertinent any more. On the other hand, I greatly value the humor of classic American movies and comic strips. So I am receptive to American humor. Sometimes the stories are pretty clever, but they do not get any reaction in me. I feel just indifferent about them. If you are from the far corner of Europe, buy something else."
5,Great,"Exactly what we were looking for, and they came right away! Would recommend them to any teacher who needs them."
4,Great Watch,"Pros:Wide strap relative to watch sizePerpetual Calendar means never have to change the dateEco-Drive means never have to change battery and compromise the water sealVery high build quality. Metal strap does not 'jingle' when shaken.Interesting face design.Cons:A bit heavier than other watches, but feels substantial.A bit thicker than other watches.Doesn't have the dayofweek or month display like in some other citizen perpetual calendar watches.Alarm is too quiet to use as a wakeup alarm.After having this watch for a couple of weeks, I'm very satisfied with it."
2,Not for roseacea.,"I have mild roseacea. I got this product because it has sunscreen, is for sensitive skin, and is an anti-wrinkle moisturizer. I used it for a week and stopped because it was making my roseacea flare up. I did notice that it made my skin very soft, which is nice, but that's irrelevant when my face is tingling, red, and burning. I cannot say whether this is a good product for other skin sensitivities, and products that make one person's roseacea flare up don't necessarily have the same effect on other people, but for me it was a problem."
2,Not What I expected,My first time ordering from this seller and I was excited about the style and low price. When I recieved my order this shirt was the only item I was not happy with. The shirt looks like someone cut the sleeves out and the bottom seam off and threw it in a bag to be shipped. I could have done that with my daughter's long sleeve shirts for free. It was messy with thread hanging out all around the shirt. If you're searching for a hand-me-down look this is definitely for you.
1,Did not do anything!,I bought this for a sore ankle; I took the pellets for a month and they did absolutely nothing. I would not recommend this product.
4,love the watch,"For what it is, it is a great watch. I would have liked a watch with a date option as well."
2,One HUGE flaw that I can't believe was missed by QC,"It's a great watch. Elegant, sturdy, polished...Except the roman numerals are wrong. Specifically, the four, which is, on the watch face, ""IIII"". Of course it should be ""IV"". I can't believe such an enormous error got past quality control!I'll be looking for a new one elsewhere."
4,Great four folks who can't read Roan Numerals,"I 've had this watch four around a month now and the only real problem is I can't figure out what the time every now and again. I remember having to learn roman Numerals in grade school, I=1 II=2 III=3 IV=4 and V=5.Out side of not knowing what tie it is twice a day, it works fine and looks great, I'll likely buy my next watch from Relic."
3,"Quaint book - reflective of the time it was written, 1972.","I was looking for an introductory book to help kickstart my research into the Roman army. So I bought Wilkes's little paperback.It is indeed an insightful, knowledgeable and easy text. Part of the interest (and fun) in reading this book was the enjoyment I took in Wilkes's writing style (and tone): one of a school teacher giving a (young) classroom a lesson in ""soldiering"". Great quote/example from The Roman Army: ""....by the way, the Latin name for military sandals was caligae. The Emperor Gaius wore them as a child, in camp with the soldiers, so he was nicknamed Caligula ""little boot"". He grew up to be a nasty piece of work"".A lot of it also seemed dated - there appears to many subsequent books on the subject that fill in gaps that Wilkes claims ""are unknowns"". And the illustrations look like they were done by the imaginary classroom I alluded to earlier....terrible!"
2,Difficult listening indeed...,"This compilation of leading experimental/industrial acts features some rare CD appearances by the likes of Portion Control and Bushido. The music is difficult to listen to in the sense that you have to put up with annoying vinyl surface noise, something we thought we would not have to put up with anymore. Some of the entries (eg. SPK, NWW, Coil) are actually available in clean digital form on original albums by the respective artists. It's worrying to think there now seems to be no original master tapes in existence for acts like PC!"
4,WELL.....AIIGHT!,"I agree, some of these songs don't sound right screwed, but the whole nature of the talent of 5000 Watts, made this album raw! You can't go wrong buying this CD, but once again, you have to understand the music before purchasing this Cd."
3,ok cd,Bought this cd 6 years ago still dont listen to it if you buy this cd you should be a fan of chopped and screwed music if not satay away
4,As far as crunk albums go...,"I'm listening to it right now... and once I turn it on, it plays straight until the end. I tend to listen to music an album at a time, so it's more of a test of continuity than overall quality. I like it for that reason, not many albums can boast that."
2,A book for beginners at best,"For anyone who has been into wine for more than a month, this book will show you nothing new. I found it interesting that Linda refers to Robert Parker's ""The Wine Advocate's Vintage Guide"" as one of the best guides she has come across. This is the one peice of advice that I could use. Save the 21.00 you will spend for this book and put that amount towards the purchase of ANY book by Robert Parker."
1,very poor quality binding,"When I received this book and opened it, the binding literally fell apart. Thinking it was a fluke, I sent it back and ordered another copy. The same thing happened. It's not an inexpensive book. You'd think they'd take more care in the publishing process."
5,every day meals you can use every day,"I use the six ingredient cookbooks every day.Most cookbooks are filled with recipes you'll never use. Not this one. Practically every recipe will be used by the every day person using this book. They're fast, simple, and good."
1,POOR QUALITY,"I purchased this DVD to show my English classes. The quality of the film was incredibly poor, as was the sound. I showed about 20 minutes of this movie, then stopped. It was too painful. Usually the students love to watch movies, but when I turned this off, they actually cheered. I returned it."
3,A good game but not the best,"Shining Force is a solid turn-based strategy RPG. There is a plot but it is just OK, there to drive you into battles. The ensemble cast of characters is huge and you don't really feel attached to them, its more like working toward a full set of chess pieces and then using them to their best effect against each set of opponents.The battles are sometimes challenging, sometimes not, but they are why you play this game. Not for the graphics, which aren't that good, or the traditional RPG aspects (you aren't given much control over your stats).For a better game that is similar, try either Fire Emblem for GameBoy Advance or Final Fantasy Tactics for Sony Playstation."
1,NO MAINTENANCE CONTRACT RECEIVED YET...STILL WAITING,"This was charged to my VISA account, $19.99, the agency that handles the service/maintenance contracts phone me and said they were sending me a printed copy of the contract.....still awaiting that......this service/maintenance contract was in conjunction with a portable dishwasher I had purchased."
3,Great book for teaching guideline,An excellent resource. We use it for teaching all ages and we have upgraded from the 1st edition to the 5th.
4,Steel cutting saw,"I love the saw and it's design, but the blade that comes with it is terrible and cheap.....I bought the replacement blade, which was a little better, but for anyone doing any kind of serious work will need to find a much better and longer lasting blade....I am researching now for the best blade...."
5,absolutely the best,This product went beyond our expectations. It does everything we expected and more. Safety is out first and foremost conceren and this was met with no problems. Will recommend this to anyone.
5,"Orquesta Aragon ""Maracas, Bongo y Conga""","Even though Charanga bands do not feature maracas and bongos, over the decades since its original release in 1958, ""Maracas, Bongo y Congas"" by Orquesta Aragon has become a synonym of classic hits by this very popular and very best musical group during its ""Golden Era"" with RCA. Also this great sounding compilation was enhanced in the 90's with two previously shelved titles, ""Guacharumba"" featuring on lead vocals, Guantanamera creator, the late Joseito Fernandez and the flip side to ""Quien Sabe Sabe"" entitled ""La Cantina"" recorded in early 1957. Do not miss this great all time classic recorded between 1956 and 1957,definitely a best seller."
1,A sundial would work better on a cloudy day,"The chronograph function has never worked correctly. I had to send it back and after I recieved another broken watch I just gave up. No problem with the company that sold it to me, just a junky watch. A complete waste of money. I wish 0 stars was available."
3,An average watch for a cheap price,"I'm a little puzzled by the glowing reviews for this watch. I like watches, and I like them to be a good value. And if you want a watch merely for utilitarian purposes, this one will do the trick. What you get for the low price is pretty good: a chronograph, a date display, a Japan quartz movement (as opposed to one from China), and 100 feet of water resistance.However, it doesn't take long for the trained eye to spot the signs of a cheap watch. The metal on the case looks cheap, the tick marks on chronograph's hour and minute subdials are uneven, and the luminous paint on the dials and hour marks is quite dim.I wouldn't wear this watch to the office, on an interview, or on a date, but I like having a watch with a chronograph in my collection that I don't have to worry about."
2,"Not that great, better ones available.....","I purchased this item to ride my bike with my dog. However, it has a large connection to the bike seat and is not easily attached. Since the purchase I have found the ""Walky Dog"" and it is far better with much better quality and features. Check out the Walky Dog."
5,Buy it!!!!!,"Andrew Gold is a class songwriter in the same league as Billy Joel or Christopher Cross. His music is moving, real and genuine. If you love popular music in its highest, most original form buy this album and sit back and enjoy - life isn't so bad after all!!"
2,Re-recordings - not good,"These are enhanced or something - Andrew's voice is deeper and there are ""improvements"" to the instrumentation. It's subtle, and not incredibly egregious, but there is something off here. If you are looking for quality rather than the convenience of having all the songs in one place, buy the original albums (All this and Heaven Too and What's Wrong With This Picture)."
1,1-Year Replacement Plan for Small Appliances $125 to $149.99,"Unhappy, I purchased the 1-Year Replacement Plan for Small Appliances $125 to $149.99 along with the juicer. The juicer unfortunately did not work and I called about using the replacement plan and I was not able to use it, due to the product was a refurbished item."
1,Does not cover refurbished or remanufactured products!,"I did not purchase this replacement plan along with a remanufactured Scooba because, after reading another review, I called the company to ask if they would honor the replacement warranty on a refurbished item. They do not.I politely suggested they update their product description on Amazon.com with that disclaimer so that people such as myself do not make the mistake of purchasing it. The customer service rep stated that they do not have control over the content that's on Amazon.com and was generally unhelpful.After my conversation, even if they did cover refurbished products, I wouldn't buy a plan from them. They clearly don't have a good grasp of customer relations, which doesn't bode well for actually using the warranty should the time come that you'd need to."
4,KYB SB108 shock boot and bumpstop,"Haven't installed them yet. This is a more modern style two piece dense foam bumpstop and dust boot. The image as of today (single piece, tapered boot) doesn't correspond to actual product (check out KYBoutlet site). Amazon info says doesn't work on Mazda Miata, but that's what I bought it for (NA model) based on others' recommendations and other vendor sites that say it does work on Miata. Boot is plastic-like, yet somewhat flexible, not rubber or rubbery; 140mm length (~5.5 inches). Bumpstop like super super dense styrofoam with smooth(er) molded finish; 48mm length; says ""NAPD PB2108 USA BASF 3""; can just barely deform it when squeezed. All in all, product feels, looks good, shipped fast (~5$ parcel post)..."
1,"Wrong fitment for Honda Cr-v, Rear strut.",Got scraped and broked open in 5 days. Outside diameter gets bigger during compression and gets in contact with inside diameter of coil spring. Not correct fitment and design for Honda Cr-V 2005.
1,Fail,"poor materialinstalled easy enough but after just one winter in MI, the boots have cracked and no longer serve the purpose for which they were bought...to protect. should have bought a different material based boot..."
4,It's a rubber boot,It's hard to say much of anything about this boot. I bought it to install on new rear struts for my Corolla but when I disassembled the struts I was able to transfer the solid plastic covers over so I ended up not needed to use these.With that being said they do seem to be made out of a good quality material. I plan on replacing the rear struts on my Festiva soon so I'll probably use these then.
3,Great buy but not what I expected,"I own the VHS bottoms up series that Joyce released back in the late nineties. I was looking to upgrade to a DVD version. Although this a good DVD. It is missing many of the exercises from the VHS version. The segments for the lower body and the back are much shorter. I've tried using this DVD version but just do not feel as though I am getting the same level of exercise as from the VHS series. I'm not saying that it will not work, I'm sure it will but it is being touted as a replica of the previous version, and it is not. I would feel better if it was titled as the ""new and improved"" but not as though it is the same release but only in DVD."
3,It depends upon your needs and preferences,"I've been using Cyber Acoustics low end speakers for a few years. I just wanted speakers for a pc I put together myself, and they were clean although a bit tinny. I like to hear vocal and piano, and they get by. I just got this 3 piece set as an upgrade, and although the two peripheral speakers are a bit better than my original pair, the boom box kicks out bass even when I turn it off on the right speaker (which is the only control over it I have as my sound card has very limited controls). To me the boom box is an over compensation...like saying ""now let's add bass."" I've faced it against the wall and put a towel over it. I'll probably give these to a friend, and get their two speaker product. The only reason I have to do that is the power supply runs through the boom box first, and then to the periperal speakers.If you like clean peripherals and want to feel the booming bass, this is a good set for the money, especially when shipping is free."
5,Pleasant suprise.....,"Picked these up on Saturday, day before yesterday, to accompany a new PC I also bought. Spent all day Sunday burning CDs so I listened to a variety of music on them, and they came through with flying colors. They sound good, from mid-low bass up through the highs. Not much really low bass, but it would not be reasonable to expect it from an 8"" sub with 26 watts that cost less than half a c-note. Nice package, look good, easy to set up, price was right, sound just fine - what's not to like? They were the best sounding set at the giant electronics store I got them from. Sales asst said they fly off the shelves as soon as they come in."
4,Not bad for the money,"For what they cost the sound isn't bad. I replaced an older Altec Lansing satellite/sub with these. Bass is kinda boomy and the sub doesn't hit the real low notes. If you want tight bass and want the low notes look for something with a sealed sub enclosure. Highs are crystal clear though. With a little tweaking with an EQ they sound pretty nice. I tired them with all kinds of music. They are not the best for hard rock or rap, but sound nice with most other music. The satellites do look real nice next to a black LCD monitor. If the bass was better these would get 5 stars, especially at this price point."
1,Crackles!,"I'm sorry I have to give these speakers a bad review - they look pretty good and in general the sound is excellent. Unfortunately they crackle on 90% of the songs we play.I also find the LED light on the front annoying, but everyone else in the house thinks it's ok - so that's just personal choice.They aren't that cheap here in Canada - we paid $80 plus tax for them, so back to the store they go."
4,Good value,"The sound of Cyber Acoustics CA-3550 2.1 Comptuter Speaker is excellent, for the price that I paid. Good value."
3,Good set for the price paid.,I purchased this speaker set for my daughter's MP3 more than the computer. It has a good sound but there is a sound distorion when you increase the volume. But i can't complain for the price paid.Don't pay more than 30 bucks for this item.
4,Hip-Hop BASS with Rock-n-Roll quality and R&B Sound,"Cyber Acoustics CA-3550 2.1 Computer Speaker System (3 Speakers, Black)These speakers have exactly the sound you're looking for be it hip-hop,jazz,rock or r&b; these speakers really pull their weight. HIGH volume listener!"
3,Nice Sound,"Other than the very deceptive advertising about RMS output nothing but good to say about these speakers. My guess is that they are about 15 watts RMS, based on a 90 RMS(continuous not peak) watt rating of my Pioneer home system. It would blow these across the house pushing 12 inch woofers. Advertising used to be much more truthful, too bad. Knocked two stars just on the deceptive nature of the advertising."
2,Not a guality investment,"I bought these speakers about a year and a half ago and was impressed by the great bass. However, the satellite speakers (despite all the adjustments I made) have always had a tinny and constant faint static sound. Just recently one of the satellite speakers stopped working altogether; these just aren't good quality speakers."
2,Terrible Subwoofer,"this product is ok if you listen to music or anything at a quiet or hardly moderate level. but when you want to listen to music loud- this product doesnt cut it. The sub on this is HORRIBLE. it cant even play a song with bass at any level. so my review is this simply- if you dont care about bass, get it. but if you want to listen to even a moderate level of bass or any at all, look for something else because these suck"
1,"Angry, Dissappointed.","I'm angry, I bought this product and within the first week the subwoofer has broken. Apparently I can't return it or get my money back or get a different set of speakers. The speakers were great until the broke. Very disappointed. I want my money back."
2,Didn't like it,"I bought this and all the subwoofer would put out was a Thump sound for the bass-lines. No real tone, just a thump. I took it back for a logitech x220 and I am much happier.This also has one other HUGE problem. When I opened the box there was a sticker on the subwoofer stating that there is no magnetic field protection around the unit. Don't set it near hard drives, disks, tapes, etc. That worried me and was the other reason I returned it."
2,Faulty Subwoofer,"This product was for a great price but the sound that it put out was very tinny and sometimes very distorted at low and high volumes. The largest problem i had was that the subwoofer crackled a lot. 1 out of 3 times i turned it on it would just start crackling. I regret getting this product and have realized that in terms of sound systems, the size does not matter. This is proved by the fact that the satellites are really half the sizr that they look. The actual driver is located on the lower half of the satellite and the upper half has nothing behind the covering. This was dissapointing. Do not be fooled by the size of this system. You can spend your money on a lot better system than this one."
1,Just bad.,"I have tried those in the RadioShack and it is wonderfull example of horrible sound. If you're expecting SOUND, just pass over."
2,"Ok , but nothing impressive","Got this the other day because of all the hype i read online about how great and loud it was. Your better off with a logitech , or anything but this . Not magnetically sheilded so you cannot put it next to a TV without it feeding back . Bass is horrible , and distorted . Not very impressed at all . Would not recommend to anyone . spend another 10 dollars and get something better ."
2,not great for music,"I asked for these speakers and received them as a gift. They just don't sound great for music. The bass is great, but there are no controls for the treble, which I think is where a lot of the problems come in. The treble sounds way too high, and if you're used to more control (or just better speakers or headphones) these just aren't that. I'd almost rather listen to my laptop's speakers. And that's saying something."
4,Decent for the price,"For the price I paid...great. If you want something better, pay over 100 for them. Good for one room amplification and no more. If you have roommates, this is pretty good."
5,Speakers,"I bought these for my teenage son. This is actually the second set I bought, the other was also for a teen. They prefer to use the computer instead of a larger stereo but want the same sound. These speakers can really go loud without distortion and the bass the exactly what they want."
1,Choose something else,I have a new set of these and I'm replacing them because they are horrible. I listen to music and the sound of these at anything approching any moderate volume is bad. Even at low volume the treble is distorted and crackels right out of the box. At most volume levels the sound breaks up and distorts very very badly. Both the bass and the treble are distorted. These may be ok for those who just want to hear the beeps of the computer but don't waste your money on these if you want to use them for any real listen pleasure. They have caused me nothing but greif and I would never consider buying any other product from this company.
1,Epic Fail,"I loved this speaker system in the begenning, the bass was good, the speakers were clear. But about a week of light duty use(Maybe an hour a day) the right speaker(the one with the controls) started to cut out, and now no sound comes out at all. I would not recommend anyone buying this."
2,muddy bass and overall sound,"I was disappointed with the sound of the CA-3550, given the excellent reviews it received on Amazon. I got it specifically because it had a separate subwoofer volume. But it's not balanced properly, because the subwoofer is too loud and muddy. I have the subwoofer volume on the minimum all the time and wish I could dial it down even more. So that defeats the purpose of having the subwoofer volume. The tweeters are not very clear either. I have the overall volume only at 10% because higher than that is muddy.+ decent value for $40- muddy sound- subwoofer volume is not balancedConclusion: In retrospect, I would not have bought this speaker. I would have preferred to buy a $40 2.0 (no subwoofer) system that had a cleaner sound, even if less powerful."
5,A pictorial description of the beauty of the Maltese islands,"Published in 1990, there is no doubt that some of the images in this book have changed. However, since the island has been inhabited for thousands of years and lie roughly in the center of the Mediterranean, there is a deep-rooted culture. This lengthy history has also led to the development of a large number of tourist attractions and they change very little, even over decades.Most of the images here are of the cultural health, wealth and history of the islands and those resources are impressive. There are cathedrals, dwellings, statues, paintings, crafts and ancient rock carvings. Malta is rarely mentioned in the news or in travel literature and that is unfortunate. It is a country with a rich heritage that rivals that of Greece and Italy, and from this book it is easy to see."
3,good luck women.,"So, I'm a new student...but, I decided that I was going to stick with karate class because I enjoyed it...so it was time to buy a gi. Well, based on weight, the size I ordered should fit. (I knew it would be long...all the pants I own have to be hemmed!) This is definatly made for men. I'm going to have to have it altered quite a bit. The pants barely fit my hips and the top is just huge (though, any size smaller and it would be even worse!) So, Women, good luck! If you have any curves at all, just know that you will need to do some altering. Add that into your price you're willing to spend on a uniform."
5,EDUCATIONAL TRANSFORMER CAR!,"I had fun transforming this car. Because of the magnets on the pieces, everything fits easily together, and the pieces are large enough for a 3 year old to help put it together without breaking it. Well made, innovational, great product! WHY DON'T THEY MAKE BARBIE CARS LIKE THIS?"
3,A sound track from Deep Forest,"It's not really fair to compare this CD to other Deep Forest releases, as it is a soundtrack to a Movie and not a ""real"" Deep Forest CD. Having said that it's a little bit disappointing in it's content and is more electronic than Deep Forest have been of late. But wait, It's only disappointing because it isn't up the amazingly brilliant Standards of ""Boheme"" and ""Made In Japan"". If I didn't have those to compare it to, I'd think it was a super CD. If you're new to Deep Forest and you liked the music from the movie ""Le Prince du Pacifique"" then this is the one to buy. Then when you're hooked be amazed by checking out their other CD's. There are a couple of Gems on Pacifique,including the title track and Ouverture huahiné. Overall this CD is a must for fans."
2,"Nice, but won't stay on","The product came as described and was well made, however would not stay on my dog's feet for more than a few minutes. I made sure to measure my dog's foot before-hand with measuring tape and had my husband double-check to make sure I took the right measurement. We still could not get them to stay on our dog's feet no matter what we tried. Nice product, but not very useful."
1,Dog Booties,"My Chihuahua Machito hates them with a passion! As soon as I put them on him he shakes them right off.I'm not sure how to keep them on him.They have velcro,and I tighten them....then off they go.I dont recommend these.way too easy to come off."
1,Season four of The Lexx is a great disappointment.,"Season four of The Lexx is a great disappointment. The planets Fire and Water, which were very interesting in season 3 have been destroyed, and now the Lexx and crew experience ""the little blue planet"" a ""type 13 planet in its end stages"" meaning Earth.There are a few laughs, but the shows in season 4, even with the talents of Bunny and Prince are not very well written and in many cases just plain dumb.The episode called ""the game"" is a rare exception in season 4, as it is a very good episode.I enjoyed season 3 much better."
1,defective,"This book apparently had a bad printing run. I have ordered it twice, and both times the pagination was all messed up. Amazon has not figured this out yet, despite several attempts to tell them."
3,tastes good but not worth the money,The fruits and nuts are really good. I like that the nuts are unsalted. The bag is a lot smaller than I thought. I expected it to be twice as big for the amount that I pay per bag. It's cheaper to buy fruits and nuts from Costco or Trader Joes.
4,Just right,I find this to be a good product. Like the convenience of having individual bags because it stays fresh until you are ready to eat it. Also keeping the nuts bagged separately helps to maintain their crunch. I keep them in my desk at the office. I also find they satisfy my sweet tooth if I am wanting just a little something after lunch.
1,MOLDY mess. Don't buy this from amazon.com,"Usually, Pemmican Jerky is quite good. I was eating my last bag purchased from amazon.com and realized that the whole bag was white with MOLD. I've read elsewhere that others have gotten moldy jerky from amazon.com. Grossed me out."
4,an outstanding book about th present complex political arena,"I usually read at the least a couple of books together. With this one, I could not. It occupied my time, my mind, and my emotions. It is well written in expression of human dilema, complexity of the region and the world's web around it, and the author's integrity and belief in goodness in human beings, in spite of their differences. Also, another lesson for me personally, what else is going on that we do not know about. Thank you for this opportunity."
2,good book as information,"Is a good book as information to know the person involved on that situation, but it is boring so long and not so much attractive ."
2,I love Taj but not this album,Big blues has POOR sound quality. The production is simply sub par and over wrought with cheezy 80s keyboards. If you want goo live Taj check out the Real Thing. I cring everytime I listen to Big Blues
5,The Whole Loaf,"A very complete retrospective of David Gates and Bread. Thankful that they saw fit to include some Gates solo material, which is seldom heard today on the radio."
5,Bread - Retrospective,"A terrific compilation of the best of Bread. Great to listen to and reminisce about those days when Bread was putting out top hits. 2 CDs full of songs - a few of which I never heard (or ""remembered"" hearing ;-)) back in the day..."
4,"Good Selection of Hits, but could have been better","I grew up with their music. This package could have been better, if they just focus soley on their 6 main albums and leave out the David Gates solo stuff. There are other good tunes missing such as, ""This Isn't What The Governmeant"", ""Don't Shut Me Out"", ""You Can't Measure The Cost"", ""Blue Satin Pillow"", ""Welcome To The Music"", ""Didn't Even Know Her Name"", etc."
2,does not keep good time,"okay,so i got mine from another store but i was not impressed, i got it as a gift for cristmas and the whole thing had stopped working on the 30th of december so if you want a watch for show and ur not going to take it out much fine but if ur like me and want ur watch to keep good time this is not for you"
5,Nice pocket watch!,Good watch for the money. Replaced an old one of my husband's that did not last very long. He's had this one for some time now and it's still going strong!
5,"America doesn't need gun control, we need government control","Back cover: If Americans do not control government, government will control Americans.Ch 1 Slaves NEVER own guns.Ch 2 Are we a country of gun rights or gun laws?page 11 George Washington's address to the first US congress second session.206 pages we all should know."
2,Annoying watermark,"The paper feels nice, but why do I need a watermark on my resume, that hasnothing to do with my career?"
2,Okay Paper but expensive,I recently purchased this paper and it is nice looking. But do I really want to advertise Southworth on my resume? The watermark is hard not to notice. Also the 100% cotton allows for ink bleeding. A friend told me about Wausau Papers Resume Kit and the paper is great and it also doesn't let the ink bleed. In fact the print quality was sharpest I have seen. Oh...the price was better and it came with 50 envelopes. What a buy...
1,Watermark? Really?,"Pay good money for resume paper that has a big old logo on the middle of it. I've never seen and paper purchased for any printing have the companies logo on it. TACKY, waste of money."
4,Energetic and Engaging,"There isn't a lot of quality material out there to help people learn authentic West African dance. This DVD really fills the void. It has lively, colorful visuals, and the dances are presented clearly with a wonderful drumming ensemble. I like how the presentation alternates between instruction and performance examples. As a classroom music teacher, I hoped my students would enjoy working with the DVD. In fact, they loved it, and it really brought this exciting art form to them in a fun and educational way!"
3,Inspiring!!!,The dances were energetic and creative. The instructor really takes time out to break each move down so that it would be easy to learn the dances.
2,a bit over priced,"I paid $25 for this CD over a year ago. I've used it a few times. The dancers are well meaning but not very energized, and the steps are rudimentary at best. It might be good for teachers who have never done much dance who want to show their grade school kids some African dance steps. But the price makes it a bit out of reach for that audience."
3,"It's good, but not peak Nyro......","If you have every other Nyro album, this is a good addition to your collection, but buy the others first. Nothing on this album screams GENIUS like her first four albums: More Than a New Discovery (retitled the First Songs), Eli and the Thirteenth Confession, New York Tendaberry, and Christmas and the Beads of Sweat."
3,better than most of the junk that was released in the '90s -,- but still way below what Laura was really capable of. I feel she got very lazy later in her career.
1,"Haven't received, can't review.","I am not able to review this item as I haven't received it yet but hey, it's only been a month now since it was supposed to have been shipped (September 12th,it's now October 12th). Maybe it will get here in time to be an early Christmas present."
3,The story lines are a hoot,"My husbands favorite Christmas gift.He watched 7 of the stories last night and laughed through every one of them.He is a huge fan of the show and watches it 5 days a week.With this set of cd's, he can start the entire story lines over and enjoy the shows all the time.He's looking forward to the release of the 5th season.Highly recommended for 2.5 men fans or for those who like a good sit-com."
2,"Beautiful paper, obvious watermark","This is very high-quality paper with pleasant hand-feel, but it's also a little too light and there's a glaring watermark 6"" wide on every sheet. It's so apparent that it's distracting, even if you aren't holding the paper to light. Don't take my word for it, this is the standard (and only) linen paper at Office Max and Office Depot, check it out for yourself. If my document is so important to merit linen paper, a prominent advertising mark is the last thing I want on it. 'Neenah Paper 05221' is functionally identical at a lower price and with a smaller, more subtle watermark."
5,marine hat,"Very satisfied, quick shipping. My husband has wore this style hat for 40 yrs. Was happy to have a new one. Thank you"
4,BOOKS ARE GREAT. DIDN'T RECEIVE STICKERS.,THE BOOKS ARE GOOD/EASY. GREAT FOR LITTLE KIDS WHO CAN PRACTICE READING ON THEIR OWN. GREAT FOR KIDS TO FOLLOW & UNDERSTAND. DIDN'T RECEIVE THE STICKERS.
4,.,"Funny at times, interesting at times, surprising at times, but also boring at times. Some of the stories had a feeling of the author standing over you going 'Ya, so, what about that?'Bonus: I got a used copy that has a bunch of phone numbers written in the front so...looks like I'll be making some new friends!"
1,Codes of Hammurabi and Moses,I needed this book for school and had it delivered to my Kindle. When the Kindle is turned horizontally and book reads veritically and when it is turned vertically the book reads horizontally. Not a good Kindle purchase.
1,For those of you who have Kindlefire's.,"I think the book is pretty good. But NOT a good Kindlefire edition.First of all, it looks like somebody took a picture of the page (And they only took a picture of half the page). So they put half the page on one page and half the page on the another page (And the words are really tiny).Then, when you face the Kindlefire vertical the page faces horizontal and when you face the Kindlefire horizontal the page faces vertical.So in my opinion, do not get this book for you're Kindlefire."
3,Hebrew-English Keyboard,"Good product,had a little problem to get it working, contacted the company, they were very pleasant to talk to and also tried hard to be helpful.Overall a good buy."
2,Disappointment,"I have enjoyed the Lounge Lizards for years, but these numbers are musically dull and without much wit. Is the group getting tired?"
5,"I LOVE the Austin Lounge Lizards, in any form, but especially the title song.","These guys are amazing musicians and HILARIOUS songwriters. I look forward to their next CD like I used to look forward to the Sunday Funnies. Buy it, and prepare to guffaw."
5,Great CRT TV,"I am very pleased with this TV, I am a channel surfer and it changes channels extremely fast. All of the channels come in great even better with standard channels than my LCD TV. Has PIP tooIf you can find one of these for a good deal, buy it."
1,For Mike's sake. By Janet Dailey this,"This story is about a woman that is divorced with a son trying to adjust to the hurt she fills because she is still in love with her husband. When he returns to visit their son, they realize they still love each other even though he tells his ex-wife that he is about to be married."
2,"Scratchy and rough sheets, even my toddler has complained","I've made the mistake of buying ""100% soft cotton percale"" (210 thread count says OK site) sheets, including two sets from Olive Kids. My son loved the patterns, but despite my washing them with fabric softener and dryer softener sheets, he still complains ""these sheets are scrtachy and hurt me"". Maybe its the printing. They've been washed about 5 times now and I've taken to using a white jersey pillowcase to protect his face. I hope OK upgrades their thread count, but from now on, I'm NEVER buying percale. My son is three and doesn't normally complain about fabric."
3,"great print, bad elastic","My son loves the print on the sheets. The sheets are also thick and seem to be made from quality material; however, any elastic that was in the fitted sheet was gone after the first wash, before they even were put on the bed for the first time!"
3,average set,"Ordered this because I did not want a commercial theme (eg Bob or Thomas or Diego) for my son. The comforter is more like a quilt. If you live in a very cold area and lower your heat at night, you might need an extra blanket. My son is fine in it and doesn't need an extra blanket. I have already washed it and despite the wrinkles it held up well. I have had no problems with the sheets except that they get very wrinkled in the wash."
1,Did not fit description,The description of these sheets showed a 210 count cotton fabric and what we received was a 180 count. The picture showed a blue border on the pillowcase and top sheet.....the ones we received had a white border. The sheets were very flimsy and had obviously been repackaged. We ordered another set of Olive Kids sheets in another pattern at the same time and are very pleased with them. Can't imagine why these were so different.
3,Kids sheets,"Olive kids make great products and these sheets are nice. I need to shop more wisely next time, because this sheet set is overpriced. I have found another company for kids sheets & the quality is comparable but less costly.My grandson loves the constuction trucks on the sheets , so that makes it well worth the cost, I suppose."
4,My son loves this bedding!,"I had to search to find the perfect truck/tractor sheets for my 27month old son. These are perfect and he really does love them! They were helpful to facilitate transitioning him to his 'big boy bed' and he loves to point out each vehicle and tell anyone who will listen what it is. It is not easy finding toddler sheets with fun prints for queen size beds, so I was happy to find these. I think the quality and softness is perfectly fine~no complaints. We did buy the pillow and comforter as well. The comforter is a little thin, but a perfect starter comforter since he is learning how to use blankets."
3,Ok for Christie,The Incredible Theft is a good book but not Christie's best. The people in this book are good and the end is not what you think but it is still not like vintage Christie.
1,"Poor, rambling story","Pigling Bland isn't a very good story. It's time to admit that. The tale just sort of stops without finishing up as characters wander off in the final pages. Makes little sense and I can't imagine what could be learned from it. Low entertainment value, too."
3,"Pretty good resistance for excersise, didn't last long.","Good for a little exercise as far as some resistance training on a low level, but life of product matched the low price."
4,Fun for Dinosaur fans!,"This was a great Christmas present. Sturdy, colorful dinosaurs are a good size for little hands and are very durable. We're still playing with these a year later!"
4,"Hi, everybody, this is John here.","This CD features oddball versions of Beatles' songs. Many of them are ""foreign"" versions, with lyrics in Japanese, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Latin(!) and other languages. William Shatner's infamous version of ""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds"" is here, not surprisingly. There is a reggae version of ""Come Together"" by Desmond Dekker, which is quite good. There are three Beatles tunes played on fairground organ (sounds like the music you hear on a merry-go-round). ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" played on sitar. ""We Can Work It Out"" barked by dogs. ""Good Night"" played on Moog synthesizer. And much more weirdness. One of the cool things about the CD is that the tunes are often preceded by quotes from the Beatles and others. For example, Paul will make a comment about the Beatles dressing up like policemen, and then ""When I'm 64"" performed by a policeman's choir will play. This is a fun CD which Beatlemaniacs should get a kick out of."
4,A Great Talent! Nice Sampler CD!,"This is a great 'sampler' of Patrice's music, and it would be great if ALL (including her early jazz work! ) of her albums were reissued on CD because 'The Best Of Patrice Rushen' only scratches the surface of her talents. Kudos to Rhino Records for releasing a nice product. I wish that Patrice's earlier jazz albums on Prestige ('Prelusion', 'Shout It Out', and 'Before The Dawn') could be released in thier entirety, but until then get this CD for starters!"
5,Brilliant! I never want to lose it,"You can get Rushen's Magnum Opus on any compilation CD of 80s pop music. A lot of these other Quiet Storm gems, on the other hand are not easily found on compilation CDs, even though they are great songs in their own right (""Watch Out""/ ""Feels So Real""). Rushen has made great use of synthesizers and uses a lot of different song structures that keep the music from sounding like pop kitsch.This is a great and versatile CD for running or just listening to quietly in the dark.It's very well worth the purchase price."
4,Virtuoso Performance,"A dazzling combination of autobiography, theater discussion, film criticism, and theoretical text (plus a few other genres) Spencer Golub's treatise is unlike anything else you've ever read. Although not for the intellectually faint-of-heart, those who appreciate challenging ideas and encountering different types of writing will come away deeply rewarded and fulfilled. Following Golub's mental leaps is like trying to keep up with a very speedy kangaroo--near impossible, but thoroughly enjoyable. Try something different: buy and read this book."
2,Unhappy customer,"Very fast service, but faulty product. The workbook had missing pages, and this was not described anywhere in the product description. This caused me to earn a grade of zero for my first two assignments, as the workbook pages weren't in my book. Sure, the seller offered me my money back, but what good does that do me now?"
2,Overpriced copy paper,"I was looking for a nice, heavier paper to use as letterhead and I came across this stuff. I'm familiar with the Southworth brand because that's what I've always used for resumes, etc. I guess it's my fault for not knowing the weight of ""normal"" copy paper because that's what this is, except from the fancier brand, nicer name (""Credentials Collection Fine Paper"") and higher price tag. Moral of this story: if you're looking for a nicer, heavier paper to use for letterheads, reports, resumes, etc. then do not get this paper. Get something heavier than 20lb."
3,Good product ruined by poor tearability,"Tearability: 1 star. The perforated lines are nearly invisible, and yet if you don't grip on either side of them, you are likely to rip across a square rather than tearing it cleanly.Appearance: 4 star. Does not look beautiful but merely practical. Its pattern might be modeled on a brick wall. However, it looks thick and soft.Use: 5 star. Delivers on the promises given.Overall: For me, the tearability problems are frustrating enough that I hope to avoid these from now on. IE, when I need more toilet paper in a year or two, I will look for a different brand."
2,i didn't even buy it here but i had to write since it sucks so bad,"this toliet paper is so soft but yet it rips if you breathe on it wrong. i bought it bc i prefer softness but even if i blow my nose on it, it rips. im not even as strong as people think i look ;)i didn't even buy it on amazon but this product sucked so bad i had to write a review."
2,Less than it looks,"I usually purchase the Scott's soft tissue brand which tend to last much much longer than the Cottonelle. Also, Cottonelle's texture is a bit rough. I thought it was a great value, but I think I'll switch back to Scott's."
5,Solid collection of hits and extras,"This collection pretty much renders The Cars:Greatest Hits obsolete (budget constraints notwithstanding). It contains every single the Cars ever released plus demos and B-sides, the best of which are the last two demos, ""Leave or Stay"" and ""Tata Wayo Wayo"". It's understandable why they weren't included on the debut (they really wouldn't have fit very well on that record) and why they had to be rerecorded for Door To Door, so I'm glad this collection came along providing a good excuse to release them in original demo form.JWIN is great if you're a casual fan and don't feel like getting all the albums; or if you're a Cars completist.The only complaint I have is with the title. Just What I Needed doesn't strike me as the best title for an anthology. Good Times Roll seems more appropriate or, better still, Let the Good Times Roll."
5,Worth Buying Just For The Demos!,"As a self-inflicted Cars nut, I loved every minute of this album! I won't talk about what I would have included on this anthology - I think that's a good reason to buy all the other albums. All the demo suprises make it worth owning; And any die-hard Cars fan will be able to tell just from the use of instuments into what time period (i.e. Panorama era, etc.) each demo was recorded without reading the liner notes. And my favorite cut? ""Cool Fool"" - showcasing not only Elliot Easton's musicianship but his only songwriting collaboration with Ric Ocasek as well!"
5,This album is just what you needed......,"This is the ultimate cars collection.Has everything........Just what I needed,since your gone,magic,lets go......It is a must for all cars fans.....My favirote album.Get it!"
5,Outstanding compilation,"This blows the previous greatest hits away. Not only does it have all those songs, it contains many other hits, key album tracks and worthy bonus tracks. Most of the Cars' individual CDs are good to great (especially the debut); if you don't have any of them, this one will do a great job filling in for those. For once, the bonus tracks on the CD actually add greatly to the collection, instead of mking you hit the Skip button. To top it off, great packaging and liner notes are included. Looks like Rhino knows how to do compilations right - they don't skimp on the Cars. A very worthy (and colorful) addition for your collection."
5,Strap me in! This collection is magic.,"As a casual Cars fan in the 70's and 80's who had never owned a Cars album, I thought I would pick up their greatest hits. Luckily, I ran across this anthology while thumbing through their Amazon listings. I assumed I would recognize a few songs, with the rest being filler. What a great surprise as I listened to both disks all the way through. I was just blown away by the great songs I knew(but hadn't heard in so long) and the ones I had never heard(probably 20 of these) which were almost all fantastic tunes. 40 Cars tunes that stretch on for well over 2 hours! I am still thanking my lucky stars that I didn't buy The Cars Greatest Hits which I believe only had 11 songs on it. If it costs more than you want to spend, find it used somewhere, but don't pass it up if you are looking for some great Cars music!"
3,Why a Cars anthology?,"The Cars released only seven or so studio albums in their short recording career. And, as evidenced by JUST WHAT I NEEDED: THE CARS ANTHOLOGY, the band did not have many other recordings (unreleased, flip sides, and so on) worth including on a 40-song repackage such as this.So most of the JUST WHAT I NEEDED collection comprises songs already available on the Cars' readily available albums. As their seven or so albums are all worth owning, who needs this anthology? People who just want the hits can get the band's greatest hits CD."
3,"Great Collection, but Casual Fan Won't Recognize Everything","I'm only a casual fan of the Cars. One of the previous reviews is right, you don't have to hit skip between the hits cuz the songs are all pretty good even though you might not recognize a lot of them. Just for you other casual fans and classic radio listeners, here is a list of the songs that I recognize which I assume is just the radio hits. It's a pretty good list and makes this album a decent choice. It may be too much unfamiliar material for some.D1S1 Just what I neededD1S2 My Best Friend's GirlD1S3 Good Times RollD1S4 You're All I've Got TonightD1S5 Don't Cha StopD1S6 Moving In StereoD1S9 Let's GoD1S11 Dangerous TypeD1S14 It's All I Can DoD2S3 Shake It UpD2S4 Since You're GoneD2S9 You Might ThinkD2S10 DriveD2S11 MagicD2S12 Hello AgainD2S15 Tonight She Comes"
4,Good But There's A Newer CD Out That Has Bye Bye Love,"I bought this at Best Buy when it first came out. I saw there are a lot of songs that I was familiar with but after I got home I didn't realize that it doesn't have Bye Bye Love.They released ""Complete Greatest Hits"" later that has the song."
4,"Pretty Great , But Missing Something","I orderd this C.D. for my husband. He is ten years older than me [41] and a big fan of the Cars. Where are ""Bye ,Bye Love "" and other tracks that my husband felt should be there .All and all we both love the C.D. but, we feel it is missing something!"
2,Bulky and uncomfortable straps,Wasn't happy with these shades. They are very bulky. Feel like i'm sleeping with a pillow on my face. Also if you switch sides during the night they move too much causing light to seep through. Finally I did not care for the velcro straps behind the head. Felt very stiff and uncomfortable.
2,I didn't even open it!,I am a side sleeper and I could tell from the mask still in the package that it would be too bulky to sleep on. I'm returning it.
2,WHAT?,The distributor had an extremely confusing write up. I ordered what was on the picture and then what came up on my email as the receipt for what I ordered was something completely different. THe Amazon.com associate that I contacted on the service # was worthless and the # he gave me to contact the distributor was equally worthless.
3,The ones I got were just OK,The tail I purchased was OK unfortunately many of the hair fiber is shorter than I would like considering I tie mostly salwater patterns. This tail may be great for freshwater patterns. The fibers found on this tail seem to be almost a half inch shorter than the fibers on all my other buck tails. I do not blame the company for this considering it is a natural product but they could have done a better job sorting the tails and I will be buying all my natural materials in my local fly shop for now on. I guess you get what you pay for.
2,Disappointed This Time,"Having just completed, ""Out Stealing Horses,"" I was really anxious to get my hands on this one. But I was sadly disappointed. In essence, I missed the poetic beauty and earthy simplicity that gave me so much pleasure the first time around."
5,"A very realistic story ,",The book was wonderful and i felt like i was right there with them the whole way... How many stories are like that out there that happened during world war 11 with families! so beautifully written
4,Brother Lost,"Fine, tight writing, details of life and historical period convincing, as is the 1st Person female point of view. But the novel comes down to a one-character study. The brother's character is thin and pale. The promise of an exploration of the sister-brother relationship is unfulfilled; yet the novel is better than most and worth a read."
2,"Sorry, no.",I read this book because I really loved Per Petterson's Out Stealing Horses. But this one is some five light years away from the other one. Has Petterson written only one really good book?
