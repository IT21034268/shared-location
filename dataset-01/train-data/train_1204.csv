5,Beautiful Soundtrack,Just a gorgeous soundtrack. When I went to the movie to see this and saw it again recently on tv I thought it would be entirely made up of 50's pop music and there's some of that in it but it's so much more. Highly recommended
3,"Arrived on time and price was ok, that's all","The product arrived on time but the OEM box had been opened previously which casts doubt in my mind that the product was actually new when delivered to me. For me, someone that is just getting use to the idea of online shopping, I don't like to see original packages that have been opened previously as it immediately makes me think that someone may have returned a problem and that problem was passed onto me. Which may have been the case. When I ran the grinder I found the same spindle wobble (run out, the machinists call it) other had talked about. The yellow color doesn't even match the other Dewalt tools. Before this product I associated the Dewalt name with high quality tools that carried a price tag commensurate to the value. Now, I know that Dewalt doesn't always mean quality."
5,Very Pleased - The best yet!,"This grinder by far is the best I ever used. I am a retired certified auto tech. This grinder does not slow down when under load. There is also plenty of room around the wheels for movement. I chucked my $50.00 grinder in the dumpster. Spend the extra $$, you won't regret it. I replaced the medium grit wheel with a medium wire brush. Nice!"
3,Tables didn't align,"Got mine and the grinding tables where drilled wrong, contacted Dewalt and they sent replament tables. All is good. Been using it for 8 months."
5,Bench Grinder,"Product arrived in a timely fashion. This was a gift for someone who just bought a new home (""old"" new home). The gift was received well and put to good use during renovations."
2,Decent grinder with poor wheels,"My grinder has the same problem many others have reported. The wheels are far out of true. This leads to high vibration and will certainly shorten the life of the grinder. I'm still trying to decide what to do. Exchange it for another from Amazon, ship it to a Dewalt service center for exchange, or just get a refund and buy another brand. There's another option that might also work - buy higher quality wheels from a different company. The latter would likely be the best option if it wasn't so costly."
3,Dewalt 8-inch Bench Grinder,Don't buy if you use this grinder in a cold unheated garage or shop. Mine would only hum--would not turn--when the temperature was 10 degrees or lower. It probably will work okay in spring or summer. Main problem---made in China.
3,Wobbly wheel caused by spacer,"I got this grinder on one of Amazon's super sales for $98. At that price, this can't be beat. Unfortunately, the right wheel came with a severe wobble. Upon inspection, I realized that the wobble was caused by the spacer that site on the drive shaft, NOT the wheel itself. The spacer had no actual symmetry; it was slightly elliptical on the outside, the central axis wasn't concentric with the outer face, and the two end faces (that contact the lip on the drive axle and the cup that contacts the wheel) were not parallel. I tried to salvage the original, but ended up having to make a new spacer in the machine shop. The wheel turns true now, and I couldn't be happier with the end result, but this is probably one of the cheaper parts on the grinder and unfortunately it only takes one bad part to turn a 5-star machine into a 3-star one. If this were something I couldn't correct, I'd've given it 2 stars."
4,GOOD AT THE PRICE,"For the price it is a good value. The tool rest is ok but only supported by the side guard, a little shaky but still ok. I don't think any of these grinders come with good stones. Use the supplied ones for rough work and buy a couple of Norton stones they run true from the box. I am satisfied with the tool over all and the smaller diameter motor gives plenty of clearance for longer items.There wer no missing parts or scratches."
3,adrenal boost,"I bought this for my 23 year old daughter who has a lot of anxiety and stress problems. She has only been taking it for a few weeks so we really can't give a fair review, but she has said she thinks she is a bit calmer."
1,The best childrens book ever,"I have had a copy of all four of these books, and I must say I've been enjoying them since I was born. Now that I'am having my 1st baby I plan on reading each addition to them and keep them in my family for a long time."
5,Let's get on fire!,"The most overlooked and underrated band of the 90's. The Dirtys came from Detroit and played an amphetaminic, revved-up Rock'N Roll with deep bluesy feeling that still reaches a touching, moving intensity. I really miss their exciting songs(RIP). A few weak songs, but ""I'm on fire"", ""Rock it out Tonight"", ""Born to lose live to win"" , etc. go directly to the stomach. Fantastic cover of Eddie Burns' ""I ain't cheatin'"", and ""Shanty"" is one of the closest things to The Stooges' ""I got a right"" ever heard! (Produced by Mick Collins of The Gories for maximum pleasure)."
1,low quality baseball,"I have used diamond baseballs before. I really liked the ones I used. ?They had a nice feel and raised seem for a great breaking ball. I don't know model numbers and just saw the Diamond name and a good price on the balls. The quality is very poor. Not at all like I used before. This ball I took to baseball practise to see if I was just being snobish. I did not say a word just put a few balls near the pitching mound and watched as pitcher after pitcher came to the mound and with out fail, picked up the new shiny Diamond balls and threw aside for a more used Wilson ball.This proved I was not imagining things and others had the same opinion."
1,Fake baseballs. Do not buy,These are not real baseballs.While they look and feel real you will know the first time that you hear the bat hit one of these balls that you have been duped into buying a knockoff. The core of the ball is not official rather it is a softer material that robs the ball of its true flight.I am extremely disappointed by the misleading copy on this page that claims that these balls are official specs.
5,Great wrench,"This wrench is a great, ratcheting wrench. It's head has a handy measuring tool to tell you how far you've ratcheted. It is a great tool!"
4,"You don't really need to read this, do you..?","Well, if you have seen one Y&D movie, you know what's up. Part five follows the typical, but highly enjoyable formula. Happy build-up, everything seems peachy, a major tragedy through betrayal and death, and the always very drawn-out and perversely enjoyable payback scene.Okay. To me, part four and five were both running a bit low on gas, but they are still a given buy if you liked the other movies. And I also strongly recommend watching it, only to understand part six better (whenever it comes out in West), which is in my eyes a much better movie than it's predecessors, both when it comes to plot, directing and cameography.But you probably already know this, if you've seen one of the movies, and enjoyed it and found the characters likable and interesting, you'll watch this movie anyway."
4,Very good.,"We don't always sign up for what life has in store for us, but God allows us to go through some of the hard times to help make us more compassionate toward others that are going through hard times as well as to make us stronger for having had the experiences. If we stay focused on Him, we can get through troubled times."
3,Brief Overview of the method,"This is a VERY brief overview of the Charlotte Mason method. It gives a very bare-boned outline of the important aspects, but does not go into enough detail for most people who are new to the method. I would recommend searching out information on the internet, rather than spending money on this book."
3,Practical information but skimpy...,"This short book is a wonderful introduction to the application of the Charlotte Mason approach to homeschooling. But I would recommend reading Karen Andreola's book first. What Andreola's book lacks, you can find in Levinson's little book. It tells you what to do...it gives you more cocnrete ideas. There are problems with the book. SOmetimes the author mentions someone as if the reader is supposed to know who the person is. I foudn myself going to her bibliography to identify names. This was distracting. Also, the book does not really explain how the author implements the method. The method is described but I would have liked reading more about how she has done it. Andreaola covers that much better. Read both books. One supplements the other."
2,For the Children's Sake is better,"This book gave a pretty good synopsis of Charlotte Mason's methods. I guess if you just want some quick ideas on how to get started it will give you what you're looking for. However, I believe everything she says can be found in For the Children's Sake, by Susan Schaeffer McCauley (in a section in the latter half of the book... no need to read all of the book before you start. You can just flip to the section that summarizes Mason's methods). And McCauley also has a wealth of other information on Charlotte Mason's philosophy and methods. So I'd say, save your money and buy McCauley's book - you'll be getting two for the price of one, so to speak."
2,Tell Me More,"I could tell this book was written by a homeschooling mom and not a professional writer...not because of grammar, but the book was lacking in information and flow. I know homeschooling mom's are great resources, nothing against them, I just was very frustrated with this book. I have read many books about Charlotte Mason and her methods, and I think this is the reason I was dissappointed with this book. My friend read it and learned a lot. I think Catherine Levison's second book ""More Charlotte Mason"" does a much better job. The second book is basically a rewrite of the first adding all the information that was missing from the first book, like more detail on Charlotte Mason and what she stood for. So if you are wanting to read this book, just skip it and read her second one."
5,A Charlotte Mason Education by Catherine Levison,"I began homeschooling Charlotte Mason style way back...I am so jealous that this wonderful book was not here way back then! Whereas I had to look up each subject and work out a plan to homeschool with the Charlotte Mason Approach, Catherine has simplified all those areas into an easy to apply format. If you want to homeschool your children in freedom and simplicity while giving them a wonderful, well-rounded education...then this is your book to get you started! All you need to do is take this little but mighty book and begin to apply each chapter into your style of homeschooling! It is easy and you do not have to wonder if you are missing anything! Plus, you will not have to be curriculum dependent anymore!"
4,Easy to Read and To the Point,"This book is benificial for any parent looking into their options to homeschool. Levison gets to the point and brings an educational philosophy into a practical light. Whether you choose the CM method or not, the chapter on The Formation of Habit is benificial for ANY parent to read."
2,An ok intro but you'll definitely need more.,"The nice thing about this book is that it's short and a very quick read. But I found many of the chapters lacking details and leaving me wanting more information. (Some of the chapters were 2 or 3 pages long!) She does do a good job recommending other authors and books, so finding that information was certainly easy. I also could have done without all the Christian references in this book."
2,Levison's Charlotte Mason Education,"I felt that this book was choppy and poorly written, even down to the fact that the author refers to the subject as ""Charlotte"" rather than Charlotte Mason or Mason. It does include a lot of information about the Charlotte Mason method, but does nothing to explain to me why I should use that method myself. I would have preferred her to get to the meat of one aspect of Charlotte Mason learning, rather than try to cover everything in one little book and really skimp on every topic. I wish I had gotten it at the library instead of buying it."
3,"Lot's of Good Info, But Some Exercises Don't Work","This book is good at getting you up and running on some very useful areas of Flash. But there are a number of flaws in the exercises it has you go through that makes it frustrating, and reduces the amount you learn.The book says to open some files provided on the CD, but when you go on to follow the instructions in the exercises, what you are asked to do has already been done, so you can't do the exercise.In other cases when you run the exercise, it does nothing, even when you were not asked to do much (so it's not user error), so now you can't continue, meaning your learning experience has been reduced.Overall the book is useful, is only about 70 - 80% complete, in terms of everything working the way it should. Buy it used and you will get your money's worth."
4,Hilarious!,"A famous restauranteur in Hong Kong loses his edge, and is tossed out of his food empire into the streets by a competitor in an all-or-nothing contest. Down and out, he is taken in by a cook at a street-snack stall, and together, they go on a quest to make the perfect snack food. In this quest, many lessons are learned, and many funny moments unfold. In the end, of course, all is well, and the epicure is reminded that all good food is soul food, after all, and he once again reigns as the ""God of Cookery."" One of Stephen Chow's best films, lots of comedy, and wonderful shots of beautiful food being prepared by masters."
4,Not for Kung Fu Hustle Fans,"Ok I have seen three Stephen Chow movies. God of Cookery, Shaolin Soccer, and Kung Fu Hustle. Kung Fu Hustle is by far the worst movie he's made, but the most catered to American audiences. Therefore, if you liked Kung Fu Hustle, chances are you are not going to be a horribly big fan of God of Cookery. I adored God of Cookery myself. I thought it hilarious and entertaining and not at all hard to follow.Shaolin Soccer in my opinion is a superior film to God of Cookery, but God of Cookery is just a small step behind. I enjoyed it immensely."
3,I enjoyed it,"Unlike the previous reviews I don't think yo have to speak Chinese to enjoy this movie . You get the jist from the subtitles. It is a big spoof on the whole Iron Chef popularity. It was funny even though the jokes were based in Chinese culture.Most of the jokes are sight gags anyway. It is a movies for a good laugh, nothing heavy."
1,What ... the ... hell?,"It's hard to believe I watched the same movie as everyone else here. This movie fails on every level. It isn't a good action movie, or a good silly movie, or a good comedy, or a good satire ... or much of anything but an endless parade of lame gags, terrible dialogue, weak characters, vapid plot, and so on. There isn't anything redeeming about God of Cookery. Don't be fooled into thinking you'll like it because you like Shaolin Soccer, Iron Chef, Rumble in the Bronx, Ong Bak, or almost any other far-superior show or movie to which it might be compared. God of Cookery is just painful, feeble, and empty."
3,Are these Ridgid wrenches still made in the USA?,"Ridgid's Chinese power tools are crap. There is a distinct lack of country of origin on the wrench I just bought. Whenever I see this, I know what they've done. Vise-grips are no longer vise-grips either. But they do have attractive rubber handles now to make up for the fact that their jaws no longer align."
5,A must have tool!!,"This is a great tool to have around the house. Typical Ridgid quality at a price that cannot be beat. I recently had some HVAC work done at the house and my collection of pipe wrenches ""mysteriously"" disappeared. Fortunately, they were Sears Craftsman tools so it gave me an opportunity to replace them with first quality tools. My advice to anyone that is hesitant about buying this wrench is DON'T. This is a tool you can pass down to your kids."
2,just for one song!,i bought it for one song! seven letters for that it is worth it!but ben.e.king version is still the best!!!!!!!
1,Cheap tapes get chewed up!,"I was stretching these new tapes (fast-forwarding to the end and then rewinding to the beginning - always recommended for video or DAT tapes). The first one went fine. The next three got chewed up. I thought my camcorder was the culprit, so I pulled out some old tapes to see if that was the case. The old tapes worked fine. I had to throw out the whole ten-pack (too risky to use in my camcorder) and go buy another brand. At this steep discount, I wonder if they're even legitimate JVC tapes."
1,Low Cost Equals Low Quality,"After purchasing my Canon ZR-90 this summer, and using the four pack of TDK tapes ABC Warehouse gave me with the camcorder, I went online and found these tapes and bought two ten packs due to the great price and the JVC name.They have only done one thing, clogged up my video head on the camcorder. I videotape my sons basketball games for their coaches and it was only after the first couple of games and bad recordings that I got onto Canon's website and realized my video head was clogged. I purchased a head cleaner and the first tape after the cleaning taped great, but the next tape clogged my head up, so to use these tapes, I highly recommend you clean your video head after EACH use, which is not good for your video head on your camcorder."
4,Good Product Satisfactory Delivery,"I have been very pleased with this product. I placed my order on Monday and I got it Friday via usps. I have made 2 separate orders for this product and plan on placing more orders. The quality of the tapes have been great and I never had a problem with my order getting lost. What would excite me more about this product would be faster delivery, but I cannot complain too much for this nice price. I save a good deal of money getting these tapes."
2,JVC Video Tapes,"My product arrived a little less timely than expected for my upcoming shoot, however, it appeared to be in great condition and exactly what I ordered. You can't beat the price per tape, for those of us still using tapes. My only advice is order well in advance of need. IT takes approximatley two weeks or more to arrive."
1,Problem with item cookies,"I have two windows open to compare the same product from different vendors. When I picked up one and submit my order, it is actually purchase another. Very Disappointing!"
5,Works great,"Clogged heads are caused by mixing TDK or Sony tapes with any other brand. Their formulation is different. Don't do it. Use only TDKs or Sonys in your machine or you can mix Panasonic, Maxell, JVC, Fuji, or Canon brands together. Those brands are all the same formulation.These JVC (I bought Japan labeled ""Victor"" brand) are made by Fuji and work great."
1,Save your money,"Amateurish. Littered with typos and grammatical errors this book reads like a high school research report, which is a shame because Mr. Geisel deserves a more professional effort. The only worthwhile material in the book are the excerpts lifted from other sources of which there are plenty. Indeed, the book is more of a cut and paste collection of other journalist's reviews and analyses along with some of Geisel's own thoughts. Also, it's terribly overpriced."
1,Poorly written,The writing in this book is very poor. I assigned it in a class I taught on Dr. Seuss and told my students halfway through to stop reading and ask for their money back.
2,I guess this book is NOT good for beginners,I have procedural programming background and I found this book comparing java with C++ and VB all the time. Secondly author is dealing with some complicated Algorithms. I think the emphasis should have been on OO concepts not compared to anything and simpler algorithms that bring out Java programming concepts.
5,Can't wait for Volume II of Core Java 1.2,If you already know how to program and want to learn Java this is the best. If you want to learn programming and have no experience get the Java Tutorial first.
2,NOT for a beginner!,A person who is not familiar with object-oriented programming will have tough time understanding this book. Think about getting some other book.
5,Describe all the latest techniques,Latest version is providing the information about the new framework Sun has announced (Sun's Collections Framework.) Also give a lot of information about new 2D media framework & media API's.
2,Not a book to learn to code Java,"If you have any in depth programming experience whatsoever, this book is worthless. It ruminates over all of Java's abilities and could be a good reference. If you understand programming constructs and algorithms, this is not the book to get up and running quickly. It is way too fundamental. I was looking for something to get me going quickly as I have much coding experience. I spent a lot of time reading through this book only to come away feeling like I had just taken programming 101 over again."
5,Suitable for teaching,This one of the best Java introductory books. The book is even suitable for teaching Java in a classroom. I have used the earlier editions and this one is the best of the edition. Worth every penny and then some ...
3,Could have been better,"Not a bad book. Good for programmers coming from VB or other non object oriented languages. It covers all the JAVA fundamentals, though you have to dig for knowledge from the vast information provided. Could have been better organized. I have to constantly refer to JAVA language specification."
1,Save your money,"A very poor book in my opinion. Unorganized and *not* thorough at all. Briefly discusses JFC, while displaying 1.2 on it's cover! Can't believe Sun is endorsing this book. I tried the first book written by these guys and found it also lacking; guess I'm a glutton for frustration."
4,"Good for moving to Java, with tips for VB/C++ programmers","Good book for learning Java. It has tips/notes for experienced VB or C++ programmers, which help to illustrate some points, and make you vary of pitfalls etc. Good examples, which also come on the accompanying CD to try. Only drawback in this book is that more advanced topics such as multithreading, JDBC etc are covered in volume 2, and that will not be available for a few more months!"
2,"Long tedious, dry reading. Examples too decomposed!","My biggest complaint about the book is that the examples they give are too decomposed. More reading then actual code examples when you need it the most. Senseless examples that interconnect 20 pages later. If you're looking for a book that does actual explaining of the examples, pick up Java By Examples."
3,Not for the academically slow,"The previous reader said it best: this book isn't for crybabies, who aren't comfortable with their ability to learn fast and hard and long. If all you know is VB, then you better be prepared to spend the hours to dig in deep. If you want easier books that ""hold your hand"" through tough material, there are other better choices. This book is only for those who can stand up in the fast lane."
5,Best book for Java programmers,"Core Java has been, and continues to be, the best book for Java programmers. Don't be deceived by clueless characters who get upset about Windows screen shots. Anyone who actually reads the book instead of getting all huffed up about some triviality will see that Horstmann has no love lost for Microsoft or J++. If you want fair, unbiased, competent coverage, look no further."
3,Comprehensive Coverage and Mathematical Examples,"In general this is a nice book. It covers the subject matter well, but one problem with it are the examples that are often more difficult than they need to be. Showing mathematical elegance does prove that something can be done in a somewhat shorter way, but at the expense of readability and simplicity. The naming convention used here often makes it harder to follow example code. I bought both Core Java 2 Fundamentals and Advanced Features and they both have the same strong and weak points. To sum it up: authors could use less of ""we love Java"" hype and more of ""let's make it simple"" attitude."
5,"Excellent as usual, but I wish they'd hilite new features","Core Java 1.0 was the book that gave me that ahah! with Java 4 years ago. The Core Java series is excellent, extremely well written, and very insightful. Only one comment to Mr. Hortmand and Mr. Cornell - I read your 1.0 and 1.1 incarnations. In 1.1 I was wishing you had an icon indicating new functionality. Now I find myself wishing the same in 1.2. Maybe you guys can do it in the 1.3 incarnation : ). Keep up the good work!"
2,can't understand why so many people like this book!,"Don't give me that ""this book isn't meant for non-programmers stuff"". The book is very poorly written and is very unorganized. It digresses into examples that illustrate some obscure features of java without even explaining the prominent features first! It includes lengthy, detailed examples that have nothing to do with the chapters or section headings the examples appear in! I get the feeling the authors sit around getting chummy with other ""experienced programmers"" and talking about obscure problems they solved on some prior job. Not the thorough, organized book you'd expect to build your foundational knowledge of java on!!!"
2,Not the worst. but definitly not the best,"I am going to cut a blade into this ""bubble"" here. This book is :1) VERY HARD TO READ. the inserts about c, c++, VB is plain annoying!2) EXAMPLES ARE LONG AND UNCLEAR. most of them won't compile without significant amout of work.3) UN-HELPFUL, the author FORCES the reader to use their corejava class but does not explain it at all. this approach stinks!I don not recommand this book."
4,Good but not great,"This is a good book, but I am a little surprised to find that it's so Windows-centric. Normally, I won't think much of it, but this is a Sunsoft book! I bought this because I figure it would be a good choice for Unix programmers. This is unfortunate because the material on Java itself is very good. If you don't use Windows, just skip over the materials on Windows tools, VB tips and the like."
4,After reading 4 Java books I finally found a good one.,"After reading 4 Java books and remaining largely clueless, this book finally teaches the topic in enough depth for a real programmer to make sense of the material. I borrowed a friend's ""Learn Java in X Days!"" and found that it skimmed the material and left more questions in my mind than I'd had before I ever read it. This book treats the material in enough depth that I could finally understand what was going on. It uses real-world coding examples instead of silly stuff. (One book I read made you write a ""Jaberwocky"" class, for goodness sakes!) They cover OO design, for those of us coming from the procedural world. I recommend the book to programmer friends wanting to learn Java."
3,Must read book for any Java beginners,"If you are learning java better first pick this book because it seems good suited to both novice and expert. Thus if this is the first book of your choice you are lucky, you can become an expert from the novice state."
1,Unstructured ramblings - nothing connects,"Too much rambling; not enough Java. I felt I was reading a book with every second page missing. Too many worthless asides about how VB does something, useless to me. Just a collection of lecture notes, with no key."
2,Do not buy this book unless you're an experenced programmer!,"I know most books get mixed reviews and I really don't know why so many people like this book. There are no full programs like, for example, the Deitel & Deitel Java-How to Program book. At least that book has full working programs and a line by line explination of each one as well as exercises at the end of every chapter. I just took a Java class through my company and a lot of the people in that class had not programmed in years or didn't have any OO programming experence. We used this book for our class and we all agreed it was terrible. I had the Deitel & Deitel book and let someone borrow it and he liked it much better. So don't waste your money, I would suggest going to a book store and skimming a varity of books, then buy the one that makes the most sense to you!"
3,"It's okay, if that's all you can find","If there's one thing that drives me nuts about computer programming books, it's when the authors try to hide complexity by offering some special utility or library to make programming ""easy"". For a newbie it means you only know Java in the context of their tool, but believe me, the first job you get won't be using that tool.The other problem with this book is that the authors go off on tangents in nearly every chapter, sometimes spending a mere paragraph on the fundamentals while trying to show you something ""cool"". Cool is for later, once you know what you're doing.I'd recommend Beginning Java 2 by Ivor Horton over this book. Follow that up with Professional Java Programming by Brett Spell and you'll be well on your way."
2,Made for VB programmers making the transition,"I didn't know that ""Core Java"" meant going over the basics in excruciating detail. I have had to skim most of this book looking for something interesting. If you are looking for the ""Stroustrup"" or ""Kernighan and Ritchie"" of Java, this is not it.The author makes excessive reference to Visual Basic and makes frequent dispaging remarks about C++. Most of the time I just want the authors to get on with it.When I do find something of interest, there is usually a note stating that that topic will be covered in volume II.Disappointing.A more concise source of information is ""Java in a Nutshell."""
3,"bulkey, bloated, and poorly indexed","1. Contents are okay for VB and C++ programmers but the topics are poorly indexed. It's hard to find real meat, if any.2. Large font and crude graphics are used on extra thick paper and this bloates the book and makes it less portable (contrasting with Java's claim to be portable). One has to flip through quite a few pages in order to get a continuous coverage for a topic. It could be made half the thickness and weight if thinner and lighter paper were used. I personally prefer O'Reilley's Nutshell style.3. VB and C++ side notes are good, but it's annoying to see both the note icon AND the note title (e.g. VB Note:); it's noisy and redundant.In general, I had a feeling that the publisher or bookseller wants to make more money by making the book more bulky (it's like a brick that can be used as a weapon:)), and this will hurt its popularity."
2,Very bad,This book is not organized well. I spent lots of time on it but learned little. It makes you get lost in its verbose discussions of this or that. Not good for beginners at all.
3,This book is only for people who have exposure to OOP.,I was interested in learning Java and bought this book as my friend had suggested it. But I find that this book is only for persons who are familiar with the concepts of OOP. This book is DEFINITELY not for BEGINNERS in OOP. Better go for another book.
2,Wanted: Real Java,I was disappointed with this book because it relies on the author's Java classes. These classes become a crutch and do not teach the reader the true fundamentals of Java. Horstmann Cornell Pre-Packaged Java would be a better title.
2,Beginners - don't waste your time,"I wasted a lot of time with this book, because I was so sure that Sun Press would put out a good quality book. The authors spend beaucoup time trying to relate virually ALL Java concepts to both C++ and VB. HEY, IF YOU'RE GONNA DO THAT, AT LEAST THROW IN DELPHI! There are some good chapters in the book, especially related to GUI, but if you're like me and are trying to go from a legacy language to Object-Oriented, you're likely to get lost. Fortunately for me, my pal Steve just took the Java Cert and told me to buy a copy of The Complete Reference - Java2 (Osborne - Naughton - Schildt). This book puts it all together :)"
4,Pretty Good,"It's a good book for people who have at least some experience in Java. Like others said, I don't think this is a good book for novices. I didn't like how they used the corejava package on some of the code though. I wished they just used the standard API."
4,Good for C++ programmers,I thought this book was a very good transition from C++ to Java. The authors strike a good tone which is encouraging and not condenscending. I didn't really like the section on file I/O but most of it was quite useful.
3,"Inaccurate, and incomplete without buying both volumes.","On the finer points of Java syntax, such as those required to pass the Sun Certified Java Programmer Exam, this book is sometimes wrong. Do not rely on the details listed in this book too heavily.For example, the treatment of Conversion Between Numeric Types in Chapter 3 claims arithmetic operations on two shorts or bytes will result in a short or byte, which is false (p. 54). The operands are actually promoted to int, and the result is an int. Assigning the result to a short or byte won't even compile without an explicit cast, but the book says this syntax is fine.Fair warning: This book is incomplete without Volume II, so plan to buy both if you buy the first. Often, while reading a section, important information for a complete treatment of the subject is left out and a reference to the second volume is mentioned. Again, this is only a problem if you buy one and not the other."
2,Need help in Java,I wish to start from the very basics of Java. I am basically interested in learning Java to be used with XML.Can anyone suggest me a book that can give the the basics of Java as well as use of XML in Java.
2,Avoid this,"As another reviewer correctly pointed out, this is simply an old bargain-bin record that Varese Sarabande cleaned up and repackaged. Varese did this occasionally in their early years when their catalog was still on the thin side. If you are a casual listener who has fond memories of seeing these films and simply wants to relive those experiences, this might be okay for you. If you're a more devoted film music fan, or a Rozsa collector, I can guarantee that you'll be severely disappointed. These are sloppy, sub-par performances with intonation problems everywhere.I recommend this recording as an alternative:Miklos Rozsa Conducts His Epic Film Scores. It's out of print, but available as an MP3 download. The content is almost the same; Rozsa conducted it himself, so the performances are much better."
5,Loved it,Great follow up to the first movie!! Tons of action. If you're a motoGP FAN THIS IS A MUST!!! Watch it now.
3,Just OK...,"This DVD content was just 'ok'. I've seen the other films, and this one does not do anything groundbreaking. Seemed to be more like a recap of the motoGP season if anything. Could have been better by doing more behind the scenes and bike prep etc... or even spending some time with the riders in their personal lives. I suppose if you're a diehard motogp fan, then this would be the next logical DVD to watch..."
4,"Hair Raising, High Energy. Real Heroes","There is no doubt that Valentino Rossi is the Greatest Champion in the history of the sport. I was dissapointed that some of the on-line trailer footage wasn't integrated into the final version and I would have enjoyed more footage of other Riders thoughts and struggles. Faster still holds the top spot in my heart, but I would recommend any one of the series of 3 movies for an in depth intro to the sport, or as just flat-out entertainment. Many Thanks to the Racers, the FIM and especially the Crew of ""Fastest"". You have done it again.Fastest"
4,Scarperia Dreams,After having spent time in Italy near one of these raceways I became intrigued. This documentary provides solid insight for racing unlike much in the U.S.. Definitley worth the watch.
4,Great quality video footage,I was impressed with the quality of the video work and interviews. I was a little lost on the direction of the film. I wish everything was In a more chronological order.Overall I feel this was not as good as the previous film.
1,Worshipfully Boring!,"Much to my regret, I believed the previous reviews...and made a huge error by buying this ""Moped"" of a documentary.I suppose that the people who stand to enrich themselves by the sales of this DVD, fancied that they wouldn't trick many actual racers, or knowledgeable fans of same, into parting with $...so they tailored it to the girlies & gays who have ""a thing"" going for Rossi...for which this is a overly-worshipful tribute.Oh, the photography is not all that great, either...although, albeit, it is an improvement on the first one, ""FASTER."""
4,fastest,"It might be the slowest of the three documentarys, but it still gets the heart and adrenalin pumping! Absolutely Worth seeing."
5,Inside Moto GP,Great movie. More inside info about the racers in Moto GP. More insight as to things that happen in racing at the top level.
3,Quality control???,"I also had the same problem where I got a brand new one, and it doesn't hold a charge well. Unfortunately, I don't see a clearly better alternative. I ordered another and I'll return the first one..."
2,very disappointing,"I have used this battery for less than 2 years. As far as the minute of life display, it DOES NOT work! I have had my camers completely shut off while the battery indicator still say 95 mins. or more. Lately, it shuts off after a few shots and the flash is weak. I have not been happy with it since I got the camera, but am purchasing a new one, because I don't want to buy a new camera, yet."
5,Nice bettery,"It is a nice battery, but I recommend the ""3.7V 1000mAh"" ones, since they charge my flash faster and stay charged longer."
3,does not hold charge as long as the original battery,"This was the battery size that fit my model of Sony Cybershot DSCP8 camera. However, this replacement does not hold the charge as long as the original battery that came with the camera when it was new. I don't know if perhaps this is due to the battery or perhaps something with my camera (which is 7 years old at this point, but still works great!) However, the old battery doesn't hold any charge after fairly constant use for 6 years, so at least the new battery is a better option for me right now than buying a whole new camera."
1,"Sony makes the Worst batteries ever made, ALL DEFECTIVE","I use these batteries for my Sony DSC-V1 digital camera. I've purchased four Sony brand NP-FC11 batteries and two generic versions over the past year. ALL have consistently failed within six months. For $60.00 a hit, Sony should be ashamed and sued in a class action lawsuit for marketing knowingly defective batteries. They do NOT hold their charge after 3-4 shots. Do NOT buy a Sony camera. Find a camera that accepts standard batteries, it will save you heartaches of missing pictures at opportune moments."
4,Great!,I use the battery for my DSCV-1 camera. Bought as replacement for original that came with the camera since it wasn't holding a charge anymore. New one... so far so good...
1,Terrible Life,"The life on these batteries is pathetic. If you don't charge the batteries full right before you use the camera, they last for about 30-50 shots. If you use the flash, drop that in half of worse. I am constantly charging the batteries in this camera because if you let the battery sit for a week or more it will drain down to about 25%. If the camera hadn't cost so much, I would have gotten a new one long ago. I'll never buy another Sony camera after this.Jason"
1,same problem,"Bought this battery and it is supposed to be new. Charged it completely before using the first time. It only last a few pictures before it goes completely dead. New battery....well, I don't know. Kinda fishy. Needless to say I am still having trouble."
3,Needs more camera time,I really expected the battery to last a bit longer. I really can't go more than one or two uses with out charging. I am going to purchase a second battery out of fear of not having enough juice when I need to use it.
3,Not their best soundtrack...,"Surely no-one will say that the ""Near Dark"" score is one of TD's best; much like the film it has the odd good idea but fails to ignite any real passion or energy. Nevertheless, there are a couple of nice atmospheres and the bluesy ""Good Times"" is one of the only credible guitar based works the band have ever done.Overall, this is an album that sounds churned out on a tight deadline with the minimum of fuss and bother. Compare it to the great soundtracks: ""Firestarter"" most notably, and it doesn't really stand up.The late 80s were a difficult time for TD, the loss of Johannes Schmoelling was a huge blow and Chris Franke was soon to call it a day as well; many mediocre soundtracks may pay the studio bills but they're not going to win new legions of fans...With shades of ""Livemiles"" in the production, this is probably one for the TD completists only..."
3,Rather ordinary disc compared to other TD sountracks,"Not one of TD's best soundtrack albums. It contains some pretty good material (Bus Station, She's My Sister) but most of it's mediocre. If you're looking for late 80's/early 90's TD soundtracks, get the soundtrack to Miracle Mile instead. It's really excellent. If you're willing to go back in time a little more, try the following soundtracks: Thief, Risky Business, Sorcerer."
3,"Has a few moments, but...","...certainly far from TD's best soundtrack work. ""Pickup at High Noon"" and ""Bus Station"" are a couple of the highlights here. Oddly, the music heard over the opening credits, as Caleb is driving, is nowhere to be found, and that was one of the better cues in the film. Instead this CD opens with the cheesy ""Caleb's Blues"". It's neither bluesy nor interesting. ""Fight at Dawn"" and ""Severin Dies"" are nice as well, perfectly accenting the action in the film but menacing and driving enough to work well alone. I'd recommend this to fans of the film and/or TD completists."
4,Near Perfection!,"This soundtrack is a rare gem, that's for sure, the movie is even more rare I think. But on to the little review here. As people has stated, there are often too many filler tracks on TD's soundtracks, but not on this one.I saw the movie once a long time ago, and thought the music was perfect for the kind of ""horror"" movie it was. All songs has their little magic moments and follows the movie in a good way with great atmosphere and mood to it. The best tracks IMO are ""Pick Up At High Noon"" which is the typical ""opening title song, or I you prefer, the killer is watching you song"", haunting and atmospheric!!And the second best song is ""Good Times"" which has lots of guitar playing in it. A fast paced track!.The rest of the album is pretty much very well done. The only bad/boring song I know about on this disc would be ""Severin Dies"". It doesn't feel TD when I hear it.I would recommend this soundtrack if you are looking for dark and atmospheric TD stuff. Great piece of work! Buy it!"
4,Great stuff,I was really surprised how good this CD was. It really stands on it's own not unlike the way Thief does. One on their best last ones with Chris Franke. Though the opening track is a little cheesy the rest of the CD is well worth tracking down.
3,Beware!,"First to clarify the warning. 'Travels of Ibn Batutta' is an abridged book for children. In that extent it is a well-written book with decent illustrations, enough to keep a minor entertained.I in the first place was seeking the original novel from Ibn Batutta ""Adventures of Ibn Batutta""."
1,Incorrect replacement item,"The vendor specification states that this is an RBC3 battery; however, the vendor sent TWO small batteries that, together, are the size of an RBC3 but each battery has separate terminals (of course). There is no way to connect the two in parallel and the terminal sizes do not match the battery (RBC3) that is in my power supply. So, I am inconvenienced by having to fill out forms, return the incorrect item (at my expense?), and wait for a replacement. I have a feeling that the replacement is going to be incorrect, too."
5,Passon by Elizabeth Taylor,"I recieved my purchase in a timely manner. I love the perfume ""Passon"" by Elizabeth Taylor"
4,Underrated Band,"I met these guys in 1999 in Key West when they self-produced and marketed this album. Two or three tracks could definitely have hit the charts (Smile, Wake Up, Tip of my Tongue), but the album never got enough air play. The band had to play covers in order to eat and never had the time necessary to develop their own unique sound, but this is an enjoyable album and the band should have stayed together, starved for a few years and put out another album. Terry is one great guitarist!"
1,Falls apart in the wash,"I bought these for my daughter prior to a trip to cold Berlin, Germany. She loved them, and they kept her feet quite warm. The problem is that the first time they were washed, the seam on one unraveled from the top all the way down to the sole. Bottom line: nice idea, poor execution."
4,A good read,"I had seen this book at a friend's, and decided I wanted my own. While it is a reference book it reads almost like a novel...one interesting fact after another. I looked for it first on Amazon and found it easily. I thought the price reasonableand delivery was prompt."
1,The monitoring feature does not work.,"Original review: I agree with the previous reviewer. Everytime there is a ""brownout"" or ""power flicker"" the battery backup does not engage and the computer just resets. The included software does save whatever files you were working on, but the point of a UPS is to allow a proper computer shutdown. This UPS unit just doesn't work like it's supposed to.New data: I have now found, Feb. 2006, that if you disconnect the usb cable then the power supply works fine and actually keeps the computer running with a power outage. So it does work, it just doesn't work if you want the extra feature of monitoring from the included software."
4,shuts off when battery needs replacement,"Have had two of these for 2-1/2 years. No problems since it only powers a couple of network switches and do not use the USB or software for anything. One issue is that one of them has shut off for no reason twice in the past two weeks. Pushing the ON button started it again. Calling tech support I learned that it means the battery life is nearly depleted. I asked them to add that to their literature. It makes the little red light that is marked ""replace battery"" in the literature useless since it won't come on until the battery is completely dead. They use the ""it turns off for no reason"" as their warning that the battery need replacement soon. Either that or the tech was blowing smoke."
3,Good but outdated,"This book helped me pick up a few new brandies, and I absolutly love the comentary on the spirit and the different countries of origin. It's more than just a brand guide, it's an enjoyable read about these different origins. However, the book is a bit outdated and won't feature many of the new brandie or even the changes many have undergone."
1,...,"I cannot believe I spent money on this talentless [material]. I shall never forgive myself. So this is what popular rap is all about... horrible, unoriginal, infantile lyricism with slurred vocals with no fluency whatsoever? Just because they can produce ""tight"" beats (aside from ""Still Fly,"" I think the beats [are unacceptable])? Anyone can learn to produce beats, and it'll take them about a week. If you want to talk about talent, show me someone who can a) sing and b) play an instrument. That is talent. ... ""Still Fly"" is the only song that is anywhere near decent. And you have to love the ""variety"" of material presented in this... money, drugs, sex, killing. This is why I've moved away from rap and into more meaningful genres of music."
2,This was horrible,Still fly is annoying as hell. Oh Yeah is annoying as hell. The only tight song was Big! So that is why I gave it two stars at all. Who are these other rappers? DON'T WASTE YOUR $!
1,STICK TO PRODUCING,MY TITLE SAYS IT ALL. IF YOU CAN'T RAP YOU SHOULDN'T TRY THEN AND DO US A FAVOR. THE ALBUM IS HOIRRIBLE. WE SHOULD NOT SUPPORT THIS KINDOF BRAINWASHING MUSIC MAKING US THINK THAT IT'S ALL ABOUT ICE. =THE BIG TYMERS NEED A CLUE AND NEED TO STOP SELLING OUT.
1,a shameful addition to the art of hip hop,"cash money isn't true hip hop. i don't consider rhyming about nothing but boasts of cars and diamonds art or music at all. i don't understand how records like these sell... apparently peeps get to deep in living in hopes that they'll have what these guys have for some reason. you want real hip hop, get some rawkus in your blood. embrace the underground, and hope that more talented artists make it into the mainstream so we can hear something that isn't complete garbage on mtv all the time. peace"
2,what happened to dem boyz?,"as a long time supporter of cash money records (i own about every cd they ever made), i gotta say that this is one of the worst efforts i've heard from them. they used to drop classics where you knew every song on the cd would be tight, but since the break-ups and everything...anyway, it's just not that good of a cd and that's a big statement comin from me. it's just weak as hell."
4,"3.5/5 Mics,","One of the greatest producers from the south MANNIE FRESH produces and raps in the group together with BABY, The duo is not known for making great lyrics and u can tell listening to the album that they aren't know lyrical-wordsmiths HOWEVER the beats and the songs are candy for the ears for what they lack in talent in lyrics they messure with funny rhymes and tight flows.The best songs is no doubt is STILL FLY & #1.Oh... When the F*** is TQ's album gon get released, I'm Waitin' (he is the biggest thing in r&b since Nate Dogg)"
2,Stupid.,"There's only two songs that are tight, they are ""Still Fly"" and ""Oh Yeah!"" I burned this from a friend, and I'm glad I didn't waste my money on this garbage."
1,The Definition of Disgraceful Hip-Hop,"If You ever wonder whats wrong with the Hip-Hop scene, just look at Cash Money. Their lyrics and subject matter are only made up of Cars, Women, Houses, and Money. They get annoying real fast, thank god B.G. and Juvenile got away from them. I'm not saying im a fan of BG or Juvenile cause im not, I dont really like down south hip-hop. When The Big Tymers get on the mic they show that they try to live the life of a Bill Gates or a Donald Trump with all the money and cars that they got, I mean come on, cant they come up with some real material. All they have is good beats and thats it. I dont recommend this album its garbage."
5,Big Tymers/Cash Money are back!,"No wonder this album was the number 1 album in the country. This entire album is straight fire. Although it was disappointing to see that the only Hot Boy appearance was Lil Wayne in the intro; TQ, Mikkey, Stone, Boo, Gotti, and Trick Daddy all more than make up for the cameos. Also, Mannie Fresh allowed Jazze Pha to produce two tracks on the album including one of the albums highlights ""Sunny Day"". Other stand out tracks are the first single, ""Still Fly"", ""Hello"", ""Lil Mama"", and the Trick Daddy assisted ""Da Man"". This is Cash Moneys most versatile and consistent album in years. Baby has stepped up his game spitting and Mannie's beats and lyrics are as creative as ever. This album is a definite triumph for Cash Money and southern rap."
2,some songs are good but this isnt real rap (2.5 stars),"some songs are pretty good like ""Still Fly"" ""Oh Yeah"" and ""Da Man"" but really this isnt real rap. All they talk about is money and cars. real rap talks about things like their life and guns and the hood. this doesnt talk about that stuff. I mean, its okay to have two or three songs talking about how good u are but NOT the whole album. It's real ANNOYING.another thing is Mannie Fresh is MUCH better and entertaining than Baby. why does baby get so much credit and fresh gets like none.but back 2 subject. i will definatly not get another Cash Money albums.if u want some real rap check out some Shady/Aftermath/G-Unit albums (Eminem, Dr.Dre, 50 Cent, etc.). Also check out Wu Tang Clan and some old Ludacris.2 and a half stars"
2,What is wrong with CMR,"Right now cashmoney is in need of a complete overhaul. This aR&B album . If you looking for some bass heavy beats this not theone for you .They have officialy abandoned the N.O sound ,which is not a bad thing since the sound is outdated and wack now."
1,Don't be fooled!...,"Cash Money is really really wack! I'm not a hater, I'm just telling the truth. I peeped a lot of CM albums (I'm glad I haven't bought any yet) but all of 'em were wack as what! And lemme tell u somtin they're screwing people, u wanna know how? Okay, they are coming with a video for their singles and they are often very very good! Examples: Back Dat Thang Up, U Understand, Freak Dem Girls, Get Your Roll On, Bling Bling.But guys, their albums are just awful, they're filled with awful & boring tracks! Only the singles are good, that means about 3 out of 20 songs!!! I wouldn't waste my cheeze on that!And Manny Fresh & Baby (Bi Tymers) are horrible rappers. Wack lyrics!Plus especially on this album there's way to much singing!"
1,Hood Rich? how did this happen?,"i'd of given this a negative number of stars if i could, but ill halfta deal with the one star. What happened to rap? artists like 2pac an biggie had lyrics jumpin out the page.....lyrics that influenced people, that inspired people....here we have a couple of ""millionaires"" makin yet another CD talkin about how much ice they rock, an how many cars they ride, it's pointless, i could be a cash money millionaire too, but id be sellin out rap, in its true form....the form that took so long to perfect, only to be dropped to this level....if you wanna hear dr. seuss lyrics than by all means pick this up....if u like music, listen ta something without the cash money label on it"
1,GARBAGE! GARBAGE! GARBAGE! (zero stars),"........BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL THE SAME!I especially hate the Big Tymers. Can't stand them at all. ... ""Hood Rich"" is a ridiculous album with nothing but nonsense on it.See, this is EVERY Cash Money album: ""Oh, look at us. We're rich and we're going to brag about it on EVERY song and make EVERY song sound the same!"" ...... Now THERE was a great rap group. The old rap is ten times better than the junk coming out now.Big Tymers' ""Hood Rich"" is a pathetic excuse of an album with no real talent in it. The raping is terrible, the beats are awful, and the writing is ridiculous. ...P>Please, if you DO like these guys or anyone in Cash Money, know that this review is not attacking you. I have no problem with people listening to or enjoying them. That's fine. I have a problem with THEM, not you."
3,Average for cash money....,"Cash Money needs to get some better material. Not that they are BAD. But they need better lyrics. They used to be better than they are now. Think back to #1 Stunna, now that was a tight song. Plus there are zero Cash Money guest appearances. Don't get me wrong Bridman and Mannie are my dogs, but they need to take more time polishing their lyrics and tracks in general...1) Intro - typical Cash Money (tight)2) Oh Yeah! - gets old real fast (ok)3) Still Fly - gets old (tight)4) Sunny Day - good hook (ok)6) Hello - funny song i hope it's not serious (ok)7) #1 - tight as hell, well almost (tight)8) I'm Comin' - filler, pure filler (bad)10) Gimmie Some - pretty tight, good hook (tight)11) Big - tight lyrics (bangin')12) Get High - filler, except for the hook (bad)13) Pimpin' - tight lyrics & tight beat = (bangin')14) Put that S**t Up - no good, filler (ok)16) Man - bad, that's all i can say (bad)17) Lil' Mama - ok (ok)19) My People - no, hell no (bad)"
4,its good but what happened to the old cash money beats,this is good but i need one question answered. where did the beats that you find on bg's lil waynes and juveniles cd's go??? dont get me wrong the beats on this album are good but i liked the old ones better. baby and mannie should go solo i think they both have the talent to have succesful solo careers but back to the review the the whole cd is good my favorites are still fly hello sunny day pimpin and #1
3,Good but not that good!,"This is a ok album but its not as good as I Got That Work. I like maybe 5 songs out of the whole thing. Stil Fly is the best song on th cd, but OH Yeah and Put That [] Up is good too. This album needs help"
1,Can you say zero talent?,"Man, these guys are worthless. How many songs can you write about cars, hoes, and liquor? Yet these leaches are all over MTV...well, there is no accounting for the public's taste. For real hip-hop, I suggest KRS-ONE, KOOL G RAP, GURU, THE ROOTS, TRIBE, DE LA, AND OF COURSE ANY THING ON DEF JUX. The public needs to boycott all of the Cash Money Millionaires...they don't have a clue as to what hip hop is. Word!"
1,Sick of hearing about their bling!,"This latest album from the Big Tymers was a let down. It is basically the same as their others, just talking about what they got and how they got it. There is really only one song on it that is good and that's the one they chose to release to radio (Still Fly). I wouldn't even waste the effort to download it and burn it to a CD."
1,Bad all around...,"Go ahead, disagree with me. But let me be blunt: the beats on all the songs are tired, and Baby and Mannie's rhymes are very lethargic--and I'm not saying this because they're from the South. (Not to mention that all of the rhymes are about (...) and money as if they've always been rich, but you have to remember, they've not always been rich, and they're only rhyming about these things because they realize that this will sell records, not because they just ""are."") There are better Southern rappers such as Outkast, Goodie Mobb, and David Banner that have more energy in their rhymes."
2,Not Hood,"At my first listen of this album, it seemed okay. However there is absolutely no relistenin value. After ""I Got That Work"" i expected some ghetto fabolous record. I perfectly understand that u hav to reinvent urself in this game, but Big Tymers reinvented themself into something very marketing for girls, the beats on this album are R&B like, the lyrics were very weak and it sounds the same on every song, the delivery is okay. The guest apperance doesnt sound like the usual Cash Money family on everysong. Boo & Gotti doesnt cut it, the new Cash Money crew is weak, without Juvenile and BG, it just doesnt sound the same. If u like the old ca$h money style then 400 degrees or I got that work would be a good album, this CD is completely Commercial and Cash Money is falling"
2,a disgrace for Cash Money Records,"wack album, CMR has changed since this album, they've gone pop now, reaching MTV-fame.only reason to buy this album is the well-known hit ""Still Fly""and ""#1"", besides it only has disappointing tracks like ""Oh Yeah"" or ""Big"".if you want tight dirty south music, buy Three 6 Mafia, C-Murder, T-Rock, Project Pat, B.G., Fiend or T.I."
2,same ol thang,"big tymers need some new material. this album has a couple decent songs on it, but they mostly sound the same (beats) and the lyrics are about cars, rims, and all the same ol ghetto gear...pass on this one or just download ""oh yeah"". peace"
4,Excellent overall little flash,"This flash is very well built and the controls are better than other name-brand flashes I've owned and used. I've used it with an R1 and a V3. At GN 32, it's powerful enough to bounce, yet not so powerful it drains the four AA cells too quickly. It has the best shoe lock I've ever used - there's a little pin in the foot that drops into a tiny hole in the hotshoe. It's wide angle diffuser lives permanently inside the unit, sliding out and clicking into place with ease. The flash is very good close-up, very good outdoors against the light. Sony's sophisticated flash control helps get exposures spot-on. It has extra AF assist LED's for the R1 (best turned off for the V3). I knocked off a full star, though, because it does not rotate, and therefore can't be bounced off ceilings in portrait format. It comes with a superb pouch and an off-camera mounting bar. Physically it's neither too big nor too small for what it can do."
4,Great Flash,"I use this in a CD 500, like other users I love the flash. It works great, but get recharagable batteries...cycle times seem fine I have not had to wait long for a second shot. The auto program feature is nice and the bounce light is soft and clear."
4,"Exellent, but...","I use this flash with a DSC-F828, great twin, but I have an important dislike, the 4 AA batterys are too poor like surce of energy and meke the time between shots too long, specialy in crutial moments. I'm really happy with this product, but this problem make me take one star away."
5,WHY?,Why is this store advertising a product they do not carry or have? I have been trying several times to order this item but it keeps telling me a problem has occured and no longer in stock. Why not simply remove it off display if you do not have it? Its very annoying I have been looking for this flash and I cannot get it because you do not have it in stock.
4,Flash hvlf32x,"I love this flash, using it oftenly since I got it from Amazon.Great product, and good service from you amazon.again, ThanksTrong Nguyen"
1,"bad quality, bad customer service",This flash is dead on arrival. I could not return it so I try to contact sony for support. But they are not very helpful. I have very little confidence in Sonny products nowaday.
1,"Smooth hair but oh oh, watch out!!","This shampoo does smooth the hair making it less frizzy as described (so it gets 1 star) BUT there is one teenee tiny problem...After washing my hair with this shampoo but twice, everywhere my hair touched on my back developed BROWN SPLOTCHES that looked like skin damage from the sun or light liver spots. I immediately recognized that the splotches were a FUNGUS (I knew because many years before I had seen such splotches on someone else). I stopped using the shampoo right away and put lotrimin on my back where the splotches were (since lotrimin is anti-fungal). Within about 2 days (with continued lotrimin use), the splotches cleared up. I had never before had such a reaction to any product. It was scary...Maybe the Icelandic Sap Moss in the shampoo I bought was contaminated with some fungus somehow and it is not the norm but I can assure you I am NEVER buying this product again."
3,DEWALT 6 INCH BENCH GRINDER,"A bench grinder is not a precision piece of mechanical equipment.Most of my grinders are Baldor. The Baldor is quite a bit more expensive. Another feature of the Baldor is that the motor is long and ""slim"". That is nice for someone who wants to grind on a 3-foot long blade, for the motor does not get in the way. The Dewalt motor will interfere with the sharpening of a 3 foot long blade. However, a bench grinder is not the tool to use for a long piece of metal. The Dewalt is certainly adequate for general shop use."
5,Great grinder,Perfect for cleaning up my lawn mower blades. Secured nicely to my work bench as well. I've yet to be let down by a dealt product.
3,okey dokie,its a good product for a good price BUT its not all that nicer than a craftsman one a friend got at sears for half the cost.
2,Dewalt DW756 review,"This was not my favorite Dewalt purchase. It's very difficult to use the grinding wheels as they are located too close to the motor housing. There is not a lot of room to manuever your work. The other downside is that the motor diameter is almost the same as the grinding wheel itself. I installed a 6"" diameter wire brush on one side and could not keep the arbor nuts tightened. I should have saved up and Spent the extra money to purchase a Baldor grinder."
3,Not bad for a 'made in china' product ... Yet ...,"DeWalt is known for quality 'general consumer' products, but few know that it moved its operations to China years ago.Whatever one's opinion is about that fact, the fact is that the fact 'is'.I'd rather buy 'home-grown' in the future. I own a few DeWalt's and have the fewest of problems with them. At the same time, why should i not do what i can to stimulate our own worker-base?<BTW, i'm being asked here to 'Rate the Product' , ... tho there is no link/button/field/box visible to do that. .. but my rating would be consistent with how i'd rate other Dewalt devices:3-4 out of 5 .. Does that satisfy the 'judges' here? I dont know, yet i feel my experiences with the company are worth relating."
4,A trip into the past,"The CD is an excellent example of the songs from this period. While many of the titles were unfamiliar to me, (and they should have been as this was the time of my youth) the ones I knew were well presented. All tracks were clean, clear music - no unwanted noise. I purchased this CD to get a new copy of a specific title and the cost was equivalent to finding this title on a used record. I got everything else as a bonus and am very pleased."
5,archaeopat's Review,The book was delivered as promised and in the condition that was expected. I would definitely deal with this vendor again.
1,Regurgitation from a couple of tricksters,"Like most of the Frost's works, you only get half the story, in juicy little pop-culture bits designed for someone with the attention span of a hamster. What little value you find in this collection of borowed anecdotes and specious unsuported (sometime contradictory) claims, can be found elsewhere in a format that gives you the proper background, philosophy, and training for this type of work.Simply not of value for the serious student.. although it's good to see the Frosts are no longer selling their works out of the back of comic books."
4,Grand Avenue,"Grand Avenue An HBO Original Series written and produced by Greg Sarris, executive producer Robert Redford.This powerful dramatic series tells the story of several generations of American Indians, Portuguese, Mexicans and African Americans who reside on Grand Avenue in real-life Santa Rosa, California. Based on the best-selling book by the same name, Greg Sarris takes the viewer deep inside the compelling world of mult-cultural America in the 21st Century. Winner of the Best Feature Film award at the American Indian Film Festival"
4,Strong showing of contemporary Indian life,"An Indian family moves off of the rez and onto Grand Avenue, siutated in a neighborhood made up of various cultures and histories. The general tone of the film seems almost After School Special-like until someone gets into a cussing match or has sex in the backseat of a car. Not that that's all bad; the movie has a great many important messages and great stories woven throughout, and pays off for the serious drama fan looking for a fresh course. The acting is good across the board and the different threads of the characters' lives don't get muddled, which is surprising since the ensemble is so large.Check it out. It's good stuff."
3,Home Town flop,"I am a Santa Rosa Native,and american indian. The day this movie aired on HBO I taped it. I thought the actors were great! I thought the Directing was great!, but as for the script, and character outlines, it was not that good. As a studying director and writer, I think the storyline and events were weak, the story flowed over rocks instead of a smooth path. I give this movie three stars, and a good try."
3,"Not as good as Vol. 1, but it grows on you","The tunes on this disc aren't nearly as raw & dirty as the first, but the longer I live with it, it becomes stickier. I think these songs are more formulaic, there aren't as many ripped-from-the-gut howls, the singing is more plaintive. I feel the bands on the first disc were all ""F you, this is my SOUND!"". The bands on this disc are more, ""Hey, I'm hurtin', do you feel it too?"" The first disc smacks you upside the head, this one taps you on the shoulder & then says, ""What?"" This disc is looking for a fight, the first is trouble from the second it fills the door. Still a good listen, but it doesn't feed me. It's just a snack."
1,"HEY TIM WARREN, WE KNOW WHO YOU ARE!!!!!","Hey Tim Warren, the guy who puts this out. Please get this back in print. Those old back stocks you are selling skip. Please reissue with some quality manufacturing....!!!!"
4,Good source of info on parachutes,"This book may be dated but it is a font of knowledge when it comes to the development of parachutes. Unfortunately the book focuses on parachutes as a life-saving device and does not look at the parachute as the means to conduct airborne operations. Much of the book is personal anecdotes about ""how I bailed out and lived."" Easy to read."
4,solid all around,"There tends to always be a mixed response on this score from the Horner bashers and lovers. This was a score I longed to purchased many years ago for one reason only: the sequence of music composed during the Marines escape upon finally discovering the aliens for the first time. On the CD, this lengthy track is ""Futile Escape."" In the movie, the music is drowned out by the sound effects, but on your stereo the true nature of this amazing track depicting the terror of the marines and their desire to escape can be heard properly. Additionally, this CD has a track (Bishop's Countdown) which is routinely used in movie trailers because of it's adrenaline pumping climax. It's sensational. The CD overall is a great listen. It has very solid action pieces and very quiet moody moments that keep the suspense hanging. If you want wall-to-wall action cues, you won't get it. Some may also get annoyed with the handful of quieter tracks. But, it's a good balance. A great score to a great film."
4,"Good, but get the Deluxe edition instead","Jame Horner's Aliens soundtrack is great. It really captures the tension and darkness of the movie. However, theAliens: The Deluxe Editionhas almost twice as much music, much of which has never been released. I unfortunately made the mistake of getting the originalAliens: Original Motion Picture Soundtrackand regretted to find out that they released a deluxe edition soon after. Don't make that same mistake!"
3,"A derivitive Horner score, but good listening!","For Aliens, Horner again has to follow in the huge footsteps of Jerry Goldsmith whose score for 1979's Alien was a landmark (despite the hacked up job done to it in editing the film). Horner utilizes two main musical ideas. First is an eerie, low key passage for stings a la Gayne Ballet Suite. It almost copies that piece (made famous in 2001:A Space Odyssey) note for note in places. The other musical idea is a militaristic theme used to portray the Space Marines in James Cameron's film. The music is highly enjoyable, but many of the cues are retreads of earlier Horner works, including the ever popular Wolfen/Klingon theme which is used for scenes where they are escaping from the Aliens. It's hard to believe they gave THIS Horner work an Oscar nomination, when in that same year Horner composed the superior score for An American Tail.~DTodd Smith"
4,A fine James Horner Retread,"James Horner Got unoriginal for a film early in his carreer. Not Only Does he reuse his Klingon Theme for the Aliens he also uses The style Goldsmith pioneered in the original and steals the destruction of the death star from star wars (hear 'Bishops Countdown') Nevertheless he does it well and this CD proves it. A great buy, but buy 'Alien Trilogy' first, If you like the Three tracks on it, then buy 'Aliens'"
3,Not many confessions at all,"The book chronicles Magee's encounter with philosophy from childhood to Oxford to Yale to his present popularization of philosophy. And it is also a decent introduction into anglo-american philosophical approaches. His days at Yale and his critism of linguistic/analytic approaches to philosophy are the best parts of the book.However, Magee doesn't reveal much about himself and there is very little relevation about Magee. I thought the book itself was too descriptive without much insight into Magee. As an autobiography, it is not very good. As an introduction to analytical philosophy, it is adequate though there are better introductions. I would recommend this book only to those who are Magee followers or curious about him but otherwise the book is a dry read."
2,Entirely uninteresting,"I simply could not get over the horribly plentiful, useless detail about the author's life. The actual ""blood and guts"" philosophy is little and scarce. I expected an honest discussion of one's philosophical journey, but be prepared to loose interest fast rummaging through trite repetition of events of the author's life who considers himself hopelessly self important. Don't waste your time or money"
3,A synthy soundtrack for a techno action film,"I liked the Running Man. And also the soundtrack. Made by Harold ""Axel F."" Faltermayer and released in 1988. The tracks are not very orchestrated but nicely made with synthesizers. This only adds to the techno action film. Especially ""Bakersfield"" is a nice theme. Worth to buy"
1,Where is John Parr's RESTLESS HEART?,"I remember when this soundtrack came out on vynil, and merchants could not sell it because it did not have the end theme ""Restless Heart/Running away with you"". That was/is the whole point of buying this sountrack. And the fact that John Parr's ""Man with a vsion"" CD that has this track being out of print is even more annoying. Is it too much to ask that a future edition has the track Restless Heart or that ""Man with a Vision"" becomes available again?"
4,"A ""Riviting"" Aerospace Story",The author has sucessfully captured the exciting behind-the-scenes action that takes place during the mammoth effort to design and fabricate the world's most sophisticated aircraft. I highly recommend this historically accurate foray into the inner workings of one of our country's most sucessful producer of aerospace products.
1,"Bad product, Bad service","Product came with wrong power cord. Sent back asked for where I could get right product. Never heard back from Vendor (Good as new electronics), or Amazon. Terrible service, no communication, will need to buy direct from Sony.Good to avoid this vendor."
1,Did not fit my Cyber-Shot DSC P9,"Had to return this item - it did not fit my CyberShot Camera as the keyed plug would not fit my camera's port. The description did not make me realize there could be differing keyed adapters, since it just said it was for Cyber Shot Cameras. Now I know there must be differences, so I would not order this if your camera model is like mine."
2,wrong item,the item did not fit my cyber shot as claimed.. simple...2.1 dsc p50i got got cheated....now the rest or you know your model number dont work here
1,No port to plug into,"Very disappointed. This shows as being an adaptor for Cybershot cameras. Well, there is NO port for it on my DSC-W570. Am I missing something? Anyone know if there's a way to connect this before I try to send it back and hopefully get a refund?"
4,Power Cord Sony H-3 Camera - Love It,I received my power cord for my Sony H-3 camera within 5 days of ordering. It works perfectly and charges my lithium battery as designed. Now when I'm at an event and my battery get low I do not have to shut my camera down and remove the battery and plug it in to get a charge. I can now plug up and keep shooting. This is great.I would definitely refer this product to others.
1,Wasabi Power...seriously,"This device is NOT an original Sony product...it is however very much advertised as such.Advertised as Sony, gives you the correct product model number and everything... open up you package...thing says ""WasabiPower""...WTF?...it works....for a cheap knockoff.I'm just saying...wouldn't it be nice to know what your buying, before you buy it."
4,"Great for saving battery, not for charging it.",I bought this thinking it was able to charge the battery without taking it out of camera (DSC-W70). Not the case for most Sony digital cameras. The purpose of the adapter is to power the camera while using it and not to charge the battery.So if you are looking to use the camera while attached to a cord for a long period to save your battery this adapter is great.
1,Does not work,it does not fit into camera do not bother buy the sony one instead and do your self a favor
3,Good quality second edition,"The author does a good job of covering new concepts as relevant to Java 2 platform and JDBC 2.0. This book is vastly revamped and is better than the first edition.Though the author rightly says in the preface that this may not be the book for the beginners, I feel it may not be an ideal JDBC reference book either. The emphasis of this book is on how to build a robust middle tier that interacts with a relational database using JDBC.Though several examples appear in the book, they could be categorized as relevant for developing a framework than useful for learning by example. Many books that cover EJB, Servlets and JSP now a days provide excellent stand-alone examples of using JDBC.If you are looking for a book that gives sample ""design patterns"" for building a middle tier, then this one is for you. If you want to learn JDBC by example, this may not be the book you would want to buy."
4,"A good book worth reading, the unexpected is cool.","The best part of this book is in discussing the process of designing a distributed 3-tier application using Java. The writing is clear and elegant. Figures are impressive. Maybe JDBC itself does not have enough interesting content, the author spent much effort to explore the multiple tier computing model and RMI instead. So, the inside is not exactly what you expected from the book title. It should be, as Reese commented, Distributed 3-tier Client/Server with RMI and JDBC.I think many people come to this book for detailed JDBC programming information. Anyone who programmed non-trivial JDBC would know that there are a lot bolts and nuts to tackle. To this effect, the book is quite thin. You should not expect this book to help you much in JDBC trouble-shootings. Nevertheless, it is a good guide to teach you design and deploy your JDBC programs on the Internet. As another comment said, I found this book a pleasant surprise, too."
5,"Mistitled, though nonetheless excellent book.","As many have noted, the title of this book is probably a misnomer. It does cover JDBC to a reasonable depth in a very well executed fashion, but it does not go in depth enough to be the standard reference on the subject. However, don't let this keep you from reading this book! It's a panacea for distributed application development, object persistence, and even a dash of design patterns. RMI and JDBC are the technologies used to illustrate the excellent thought process that went into this book, and it is much more valuable than any Teach Yourself JDBC in 21 Days sort of book will ever be. You may need a more complete reference book if you will be doing a lot of JDBC programming, but this book will teach you how JDBC is best used, which in the end is much more valuable.Once you know what you are getting into, you will find that this book meets your needs rather well."
5,"Should be titled ""Persistence with Java""","George Reese did an excellent job in this book of providing an introduction to the technologies and concepts required for developing a Persistence Framework. In particluar, I enjoyed his discussions of EJB, I found his example and text to give a better description of the main concepts (and shortfalls) of EJB than of any other book I had read, even books on EJB. I only wish the book had a better title reflecting what was discussed in the ""Applied JDBC"" section. If it did I would have picked it up earlier and not had to go through some of the pain that I did previously when comparing a persistent framework I work with to EJB."
3,"Fairly basic, but a good intro","Given the Oreilly reputation, I was expecting more from this book. Disappointingly, the book is more of an intro to the use of jdbc. There is some helpful information regarding persistence, but I felt the book did not get as detailed as most of their series."
1,Very bad and not deep book at all,"It's not a book about JDBC API,it's a book about how to write and design programs.Contains a few examples.Author only talks and talks but doesn't describe and explain JDBC itself. Even documentation is better."
2,Better writer needed,"This book is extremely long winded, and not recommended if you are developing a JDBC system for the first time. The examples are extremely long, and discourage experimentation. The abstract, interfaces and classes created seem intriguing but unfortunately, they don't meet my immediate needs. Most of us are trying to earn a living coding? Hence I am in search of a book with shorter , and more realistic examples that I can translate into immediate use! Also one that covers writing JDBC applets too!!!!!Whatever happened to write once and use anywhere? This book was apparently written to be use by one person once, the author!!!!!!!!"
2,A light weight introduction to a complex subject,"I have programmed in Java for sometime, but have not used JDBC. This book really didn't help me accomplish that goal. I started with ""JDBC Database Access with Java"" and wanted to go farther, but this is not that book. In fact, the author seems anti-Microsoft since he did not include ANY REFERENCE to JDBC connectivity with Microsoft Access (which is on many desktops). MS/Access turned out to be the best db for me to learn SQL programming through Java."
2,A mistitled book,"I don't know whether I like this book or not. On the one hand, it's really not a ""JDBC"" book, but a book about designing three-tier architectures. The treatment of JDBC is flimsy, at best, and would be a disappointment to those looking to learn just about JDBC. On the other hand, the material is an interesting discussion on how to implement an application server. Perhaps the book ought to be retitled to more accurately reflect its contents?"
2,"Interesting, but not very practical","If you already know some flavor of SQL (e.g. you have an Oracle background) and you're trying to figure out how to do stuff in Java that you might have done in PL/SQL... don't buy this book.Almost the last 100 pages are devoted to the Javadoc for the JDBC APIs... which to me was a total waste of paper.Out of the remaining pages, only pages 25-101 explain how to use the JDBC API and even then what it covers is so basic you can figure it out yourself from the Javadocs.The middle section on ""Applied JDBC"" is interesting but of little use if you're working on a team that has already figured out their architecture. It also reminds me of old home computer magazines that featured pages and pages of source listings and little substance. Additionally, I suspect it is too complex for those readers that actually find the first section useful."
1,Not enough detail on JDBC!,"Part 1 of this book skims over JDBC, and the later parts go into irrelevant details on non-JDBC topics. A third of the book is wasted on useless reference material that you can get for free off Sun's website. You're only getting about 100 pages actually on JDBC in this book."
3,Good book on multi-tier distributed database access,"This is a very good book on multi-tier distributed database access. If you want to know about JDBC then I would not recommend this book. If you want to know how to build multi-tier distributed applications that access remote data sources (with JDBC on the server), then get this. Be warned that some concepts are dealt with a little simplistically, but this book does cover the conceptual framework of a distributed system well (including examples)."
3,probably out of date now,this is a pretty good book. good ideas but i feel that a certain amount of what the author describes is now automated by JDBC 2 classes.
2,Javadoc in book form,I have been disappointed with this book. It does not go in-depth for advanced topics and most of the helpful information is merely a printed version of the Javadocs. Better resources can be found on the web for serious JDBC development.
5,Every dancing girls favorite book,Time for Ballet is my daughters favorite book since she first checked it out from the library. We checked it out so often that I finally purchased it for her birthday. She loves the story and pictures of a girl who loves dancing as much as herself! I recommend this book to anyone who knows a dancing princess!
3,For Serious Fans Only,"The sound quality is poor, its the kind of record that sounds like a blur after you have listened to it for more than fifteen minutes, and the kind that disrupts any mix CD or playlist because of differing levels. The recording has a lot of highs and no separation. The bass is practically inaudible. The highlights are the first three songs, particularly Moanin' at Midnight which is more of a Howlin' Wolf potpourri than a straight cover. But as Janis screams, mimicking Howlin' Wolf's famous cry, you can see how much talent she really had. Overall it's an album for serious fans interested in a complete collection or the development of the band."
3,Ughhh....,"The shoe itself is not bad, but when I ordered the shoe in my size (9 1/2) and I put it on it was two sizes too big at least so order small! Also they sent a wide so that made it even worse.Normally, I figure no problem I can send it back and get another pair but the customer service was terrible and I can only make the one exchange because like and idiot I shopped two months ahead of time for christmas. I'm still working on getting the size exchanged, but if I don't get the size perfect this time, I've just wasted my money."
4,Not true to size!,I love the comfort but I wish would have ordered a half size larger because with regular socks my toes rub at front of shoe. I can get away with wearing them with thin dress socks or nylons they still rub a little but not to the point of causing any pain. Otherwise the shoes feel great and look very professional. I am in nursing school and I have to wear all white. I started out with all white Nike's and by the end of 8 hours my feet were killing me they were rubbing in all the wrong places. I got these and was very satisfied also they clean up well just run a wet towel over them and they look like new where as the Nike's kept dirt in the laces and cracks which made them look dingy no matter how well I cleaned them!
4,easy to understand,Very good text on heat transfer which covers complex subjects but is still easy to read.
2,Mean,"I thought it would be fun being bloom for halloween, so my moommy bought this costume. It was ichy, and not very fun to move in.As I was modeling it, it ripped right down the back, and it was 2 sizes larger than what i wear.Bloom is mean now, and I hate Winx,I guess my sister Kiki was right,Winx is stupid."
5,glad i got this case,"i purchased the case (the black one) on the strength of the reviews that i read on it. I wasnt sorry!! this is a great case! it fits my zvm perfectly! i dont have any problem charging or downloading with the case on, it works just fine! the leather is high quality and the little metal loop is perfect for hooking on my belt with one of those mountain climbing things!!i love the kickstand option! its really convenient when i want to watch video or just show off my new toy!!!"
2,It protects the Zen... from outside damage,"It decently protects the Zen Vision M from outside damage. I do not feel worried if/when I drop the unit. However there are 2 big things wrong with this model, which I'm not sure can be fixed by any other product:1. It collects dust and lint from my pocket, and traps it between the Zen's screen and the case's screen cover. Taking the Zen out to clean off the screen is very annoying.2. The stitching that attaches the plastic screen cover to the leather scratches the hell out of the Zen unit (this is VERY noticeable on my black Zen Vision M).However, the kickstand is pretty nice when placing it on a table for viewing.Overall, though, I wish I had not purchased this case, and instead got a slimmer case that is more comfortable in my pocket and doesnt scratch the unit."
3,Handy,"I got the pink one a few months back, and I'm pretty happy with it. It protects my Zen Vision:M from scratches and the like, although I also have one of those clear stickers stuck on my screen to protect it from just that. The video stand comes in handy as well, although I've learned that it depends on how high the table you put it on is to view the screen well.My only complaint about it is that the dye used in the backing has stained the back of my Zen. So now the back has pink blotches on it. Must be from the heat of the player, because I never wet the case."
2,didnt get what I wanted,"When ordering this product it just list the colors available and no where does it allow you to choose a color.I ordered the green zen and we got a pink case? I am not to happy about that. Maybe you should give someone the opportunity to pick a color if you are going to list the ""colors available""."
4,Well made but bulky,"Well-made, sturdy and funcional, this case is a delight. The belt clip works well, the stand has proven handy (who knew?), and the functions all are accessible and it keeps fingerprints off. While I wish the stand/belt clip were removable, it does what it says. My only complint is the case makes an already large device (I used to have a Zen Micro) quite bulky."
5,Love it!!!,This is a must have accessory for your Creative MP3.I take it every where with and now - can drop it everywhere as I have the protective covering.Got the Vision MP3? Then get the Leather Case!!!
4,"Bulky, but worth it","This case is pretty bulky, but it protects my investment very well. I've dropped this thing many many times, and not even a scratch on it. If it was just a little slimmer..."
2,Creative Vision M Zen Video 30GB Hi-Grade Leather Case,Like the kickstand and clip feature. Leather or glue has strong unpleasant smell. Buttons are hard to press with case on.
2,"Terrible case, does not work properly","While this case may protect well, in order to do any navigation with your zen vision m, you will have to:1. Take your zen out of this case every time you want to navigate2. Do what I did and cut a huge hole in the middle of the case where the buttons are so you can actually navigate.Don't be cheap like I was, put your money into a case that actually works."
4,Very durable but monitor cover becomes dirty too fast,"I have been using this for 3 years! Eventually I don't use my ZEN for watching movies. So monitor cover doesn't bother me so much. If I did I would have to clean that cover and protect it.The case is comfortable on my belt. The only complaint is headphones cable is always under tension and the seams go down first always. But it is not the case.Pressing buttons became a matter of intuition. I managed to cope with that after a couple of days.Using the case and the sync adapter is a tricky operation, because the adapter is prevented from fitting by that case. So, if you don't want to lose you data you'd better to remove the case before connecting the adapter.Overall is good. Having Zen on a belt is better than in a pocket."
4,RIP zen V:M,"i had this mp3 for 2 years it has server me well, till the day i drowned it in beer. now as for this product. it will keep your mp3 player we protected from long range falls and rainfall/snow (we went thru a lot) but the display 'window will scar really fast, i advise covering it up with a ""display cover"" plastic thingy. but this is the best protection for this product"
1,Almost ruined my ZEN,"I was excited to get this case and right off I notice you CAN NOT charge it or download music unless you take it out of the case (I have the green one) next I could not navigate at all with it in the case, and what almost and really may have ruined my Zen was the fact that while in the case, it held down the navigation buttons which made it inoperable. Not a good case unless you want to break your player."
4,The Only Bird Guide to a Fascinating Region,"Melanesia is one of my favourite parts of the world, home to beautiful, largely unspoilt islands and unique fauna.This being the only field guide to the birds of 3 of the Melanesian countries, it was a must have on my recent trip there, and it proved invaluable indeed. It is comprehensive, covering all species known to occur in the region covered, and in fact it allowed me to identify most birds I have seen. Although a few illustrations are poor, even hindering correct id'ing (hence the 4 stars), most were found to be pretty good.Maps and text are placed opposite the colour plates, which is handy for quickly seeing what species are found on any one given island at all.The book is also light enough to be portable in the field.In short, if you are lucky enough to visit these exotic archipelagos and have any interest in birds (easily the most visible part of their terrestrial fauna), don't leave home without this guide!"
1,"HEY TIM WARREN, WE KNOW WHO YOU ARE....!!!!","Hey Tim Warren, the guy who puts this out. Please get this back in print. Those old back stocks you are selling skip. Please reissue with some quality manufacturing....!!!!"
3,A good companion to the color book series,"This slim volume (100 pages) is an excellent companion to the IEEE color book series, adding information I found necessary. It has helped me understand what I'm looking at when using a harmonics analyzer like the Fluke 41B, it explains *how* some harmonics control devices work, and gives many approaches for harmonics control."
1,25 pages about Web Sercices,"This book, maybe a good Delphi book but out of the 695 pages only 25 has to do with Web Services which is a major part of the title. The book should be call ""Delphi does Web stuff"". On the other hand then it would not sell would it?Printed on the cover: ""For a Solid Understanding of How to Use Delphi for Creating Web Services"" - You can find more up to date information by a using on google."
5,Excellent book!,"If your looking for a great addition to your Delphi library, look no further than this book. It covers in great detail most of the issues that face web services development, from creating simple com servers, using MTS/COM+ transactions, and even database technologies such as DataSnap, its all here with the details and examples to put these technologies to use today!I would recommend this book for anyone looking to sharpen thier skils in COM, Database Technologies, or Web Services/Web Application creation. The basics are covered as well as the more advanced topics all in great detail."
4,This was a Fantastic book!!!,If you like reading about Renunciates this is the book for you! In this book they have to be brave right when evil is staring them straight in the face. I thought this book was one of the best books about Darkover!!!
1,Fake batteries - Cheap Imitation from Networker-7,"Fake batteries - Cheap Imitation from Networker-7I made a mistake by ordering this item from a reseller. I bought them from ""Networker-7"" and he sent me a perfect set of batteries, but something was wrong. The battery package was badly sealed (like it never passed QC) and when I opened it and checked the batteries, the colors and fonts were slightly different from my other original Cybershot Batteries, which came with my camera. I compared them carefully and realized this are fake sony batteries, just an imitation. Must be some cheap-made-in-brazil ones with a printed sticker on them or something like that. Be aware of this seller. Buy from Amazon Only!!!"
1,Waste of Money,"I was sent batteries that only lasted about a year and were probably only charged up and used 5 or 6 times. After that, they barely charged and would barely hold any power. Couldn't barely use them after 10 charges as they wouldn't have enough power hold for even a few pictures."
2,short lifespan,"I'm still not sure if the batteries are counterfeit or real by SONY, it drains much faster than the one I bought in Best Buy. and dies faster, so worthless now."
3,Barely made 3 stars because it's cheap,"This is a rehash of a few of the pieces that made him famous but is an embarrassing offering from the one-time boy wonder. This is no more evident than in the truncated offering of Koyunbaba. Was Parkening just too lazy to learn the other three parts of this lovely masterpiece? So, don't spend the money on this so-called greatest hits compilation (and, only 65 minutes of music) when his music is available elsewhere coupled with the great songs that made him America's number one guitarist in the 80's. Top two choices are: ""In The Spanish Style"" and ""The Great Recordings"". Bach's Chaconne, if you must have this 14 minute masterpiece, is available on ""The Artistry Of Christopher Parkening"", another worthy recording.Again, I lament that the full 4-part version of Koyunbaba hasn't been recorded by Parkening."
3,Basic everyday shampoo,"I have been using this product for atleast a year. All of my hair care products for the last 2 years have been Aveda products - including professional coloring the last few months. In the summer, it's perfect. In the winter - regardless if my hair is treated or not - my hair becomes strawlike. I have to use other products to help out with the dryness. It does get your hair clean and not alot of buildup. Amazon does over state the suggested retail prices."
5,EARGASM,"Could Tug of War be any better? One might as well tryto rewrite Beethoven's immortal strains! Would one ask thesun to shine more resplendently? Would one ask the planets'stately progression to be more august? No, a rose by any other gilding could never match the power, vim, harmoniousness,conviviality, salutiferousness, lucidity, cogency, uncorruptibility, and downright indestructibility of thistitanium-carborundum alloy of a disc!"
5,Take notice - these boys are on their way.,"Tug Of War, the latest effort from the L.A. trio Gabriel Mann, is a powerful album of crisp and compelling songs. With their evocative soundscaping and powerhouse rock dynamics, Gabriel Mann creates a truly unique listening experience that satisfies the listener's every aural desire. It's all here -- from meticulously crafted ballads of undeniable splendor to full-tilt rockers that smack you in the face and dare you to strike back. My advice: don't. You'll surely lose.Will this album change the world and help send Lance Bass into outer space? Probably not, but it just might make superstars out of three guys from the west side."
5,incredible whiskey soaked blues that rock the soul,"This is the capper to one of the best bands to see live in the world. This album is alittle cleaner than thier previous releases but it is still full of the love for the mud-soaked delta blues, that influenced the trio and their music, so sit back with a bottle of Maker's Mark and a pack of smokes in a rocking chair on the porch and let The Oblivians rock your soul childrens"
5,bringing soul to the heathen hipsters,"WOW...this is the record i always knew they could make. by no means indicative of their earlier catalog (which are easily THE best garage rock records of the 90's) They slow the tempos for this set, enlist the legendary Mr. Quintron on the Hammond B-3 organ, recorded it in one session, and gave birth to a classic. Often cited as their ""gospel"" record, religion really isn't the point here. I've also heard the Oblivians labeled as ""stupid Blues Explosion"" songs. why, exactly? because Greg and Jack didn't shout ""OBLIVIANS!!!"" a thousand times during their sets, or ""play the blues, punk!!!""Whereas Mr. Spencer can sometimes seem like he's trying a bit too much, the Oblivians' soul came naturally, and this record is a prime example. ""Live the Life"" is the kind of song I want played at my funeral."
4,9 Songs of pure Garage Rock,On one of their last albums the Oblivians teamed up with a certain Mr. Quintron. His organ adds a new dimension to the great cult band of the mid 1990's.It doesn't have the speed and vibrancy of 'Popular Favorites' but for fans of garage gospel rock worth the low price
4,Funny and fun to Read,"This book will help everyone from business to personal life on how to deal with the fear of rejection. In this book, John shares his ideas through great stories that keep your attention. This book is great for sales people,actors, network marketers and anyone who has the balls to go after in dream of thiers in life."
5,#1 At Frankfurt Book Festival,"At this years Frankfurt Germany Book Festival, REJECT ME - I LOVE IT! was ranked as the number one self-help book at the event. In fact it was ranked fourth overall out of hundreds of titles. It is now being considered for translation in Germany, Denmark, Spain, and even Turkey."
1,should be 19.99,"this thing should be 19.99 , it works but looks cheap as hell , the light went out 3 months later , now the display went out and can't tell what station its on , but o well just bought it because my alpine got stolen and didn't want anything fancy till i move out of the apartment complex , maybe i'll give it two stars since it was better than nothing but no hard feelings towards the seller , i just recently ordered a jvc kd-r520 car stereo from the same seller cool n cheap. i don't blame the seller for the sanyo."
4,A refreshingly different approach to fantasy,"I don't believe that justice has been done to Elizabeth Boyer's book ""The Troll's Grindstone"" by some of the reviews here, which prompts me to add my own opinion.The tale has an interesting basis in Scandinavian mythology, some very nice plot twists and is overall a good read - highly recommended. I found it tough to put down - and an engaging tale.I came to this web site seeking a sequel, or at least a similar book by the author."
2,I throughly enjoyed it.,"I have to admit that at first this book was hard to get into due to the difficult names.....so I made up my own! The story was original and engaging. I felt the characters were developed and beleivable. Anyone who enjoys magic and the idea of other realms that one can be transported to will like this book. I am now reading the next book of the series ""The Curse of Slagfid""."
2,"If nothing else to read, it might do the job",This book is not one of the most exciting books out there. I found it to be quite dull and very forgetable. Read it only if you have nothing else to do.
1,Worst toy ever,"It took over 4 hours to put together with most of the pieces needing to be glued just to stay together. The figures that came with it won't stay together and the pieces are constantly getting lost. Not bad if you just plan on putting it together and setting on a self. However, as a toy it is completely worthless......"
2,Looks so good on the package....,"My favorite part of building this thing was when the parts actaully popped off the base becuase they didnt fit where they should. I made it all the way to the 2nd floor, then when trying to connect the 2nd floor to the 1st floor EVERY PART ended up falling apart. Luckily I found it at a buyout place for $10 (and I plan on returning it), I cant imagine spending $30-40 bucks on this!If you dont have kids (mine was for a 4 year old) and have plenty of glue/tape/frosting/termite spit then I supose you could eventually make a good looking batcave to keep on a top shelf away from small children, house pets and sudden bursts of air."
1,If I could rate it in the negatives...I would!,"This toy is totally lacking in the quality department. I give the reviewer credit that actually got it together! I have tried on several nights, and the look of disappointment on my son's face each night just breaks my heart. The pieces don't stay together and nothing lines up, as if each piece is warped in its own way. Don't waste your money or time and don't get your kids hopes up with this one!"
2,Batman Found Dead Under Pile of Rubble!,"This toy would be a good example of what the Batcave might look like if it were located precisely on the epicenter of the Loma Prieta earthquake. Perhaps Batman shouldn't have gone through Two-Face Realty Corp. to purchase the Batcave, now declared ""uninhabitable"" by Commissioner Gordon himself! I mean, didn't the name ""Two-Face Realty"" tip him off at all? Maybe he could rebuild, but only if he were to enlist the help of his arch enemies because it would take five heroes and villains to hold it together while pieces were applied. Then, Mr. Freeze could zap into cold storage to keep it all together. Nothing holds like Ice. But for now, Batman will look upon the shattered pieces of his life as so many lego type blocks that never will come together. It's quite sad, really, and quite diabolical:("
1,Terrible waste of money,"This toy is the biggest piece of junk. My son loves Lego's and can put the most difficult sets together on his own. Not this toy. It took about 2 hours to assemble and none of the pieces stay together no matter how hard you try. The directions aren't easy to read and the pieces came in a bunch of little bags and are not sorted in any order that follow the directions. Once it is together you can't touch it or even breathe on it or it falls to pieces. My son is a huge Batman fan and this was a top item on his Christmas list. I would return it, but he won't part with it. I am terribly dissapointed with this toy not to mention the fact that I hate to see my son so upset everytime he tries to play with it and it falls apart. Do yourself a favor and don't even buy it."
3,it can be fixed,"ok the toy, as is, has got some serious problems. Art Asylum is aware of this and have a repair kit on their web site http://www.artasylum.com/ Theres be a pop up about C3 customer service as you enter the site, just folow the prompts and you'll get the reapair parts you need."
3,Rate it R,"I rate this toy R because building it may produce foul language and violence. I'm just glad I attempted it when my daughter was at school. [...]With much perseverance and a little filing it can be done, even without superglue(of course warping and shodding manufacturing may vary)! However, at present this is pretty much only a display piece. R is also for repair kit. [...]"
2,You'll need headache pills for this one !,My 5 year old received this as a gift but it took his Uncle around 10 hours total to assemble it. It has around 26 stages of instructions and around 400 odd pieces but the main thing is it is so fragile. After assembling the base and trying to put the next level on top the whole thing collapsed. This happened 4 or 5 times. There is no way anyone under 12 could figure out how to assemble this. It looks nice when it is all finished but one touch and it falls apart. We are tempted to glue the pieces into place so it stays up permanently.
1,Worst. Bricks. Ever.,"I love building bricks. I love Batman. I HATE THIS SET. This was the most disappointing ""kit"" I've ever had the misfortune to purchase. I complained directly to the manufacturer about their ill-fitting bricks, but naturally never heard back. Most of the bricks fit together loosely causing them to pop off at the most inopportune times. The flat base pieces are made of poor plastic and too thin, so unless you are on a very flat very hard surface (and sometimes even then), the bricks pop off. The floor on the ""upper level"" was completely warped because the bricks were so poorly shaped and fit together so badly.Thank goodness LEGO got the Batman license and built a decent kit. It is too bad about the this set, the building plan was nice and the design was nice. But it wasn't worth the frustration nor the price. Not even having the mini-figs was worth it.And what's up with the freaking LAVENDER bricks anyway? I don't recall that being a Batcave colour. UGH UGH UGH."
5,The Best!,"I have had made Baldor grinder since December, and have had NO problems. It would make an excellent addition to any woodworking shop!If you are looking for a smooth, powerful, heavy-duty grinder, this is it! It should provide many years of trouble-free service.Also, Amazon.com provided excellent service.I'm glad it got it."
5,Excellente,Je suis pleinement satisfait de cet article. Le transport a été exécuté rapidement et le livre est arrivé en excellente condition. Merci
4,Helpful,I have only been painting a short time so I was looking for something to help me with color mixing. This has been most helpful in identifying which color combinations create which shades. I am still struggling with ceating the exact shade but this is probably due to my inexperience and I believe will come in time.
1,sneeky advertising,"household essentials did not mention the pole is 1 1/2"" round,when standand is 2"". It cost me $23.43 to send it back. would appreciate all information in advertising.I would not deal with them again.I also had to wait 3 days for them to accept the return.Never again! I only get burnt once!"
4,very nice,"I set this in my old umbrella holder and it works very well. The stretchy lines are annoying, but it's simple enough to pull them taut."
5,Outdoor clothes dryer,"I have always hung clothes outside, I love the way they smell fresh when you bring them in, and now I can do this right in my own back yard."
5,Great Space-saving Clothes Lines,"I've had this in my backyard for several years now, only storing it inside during the snow-producing winter months, and it's still going strong. The metal alloy has not rusted or weakened in any way. By bringing it inside during colder, snowy weather, the lines themselves have not yet had to be replaced either. This is a great buy for the money because it lasts much longer than less expensive, similar items - several of which I've gone through in the 4-5 years before I found this one. It folds flat for storage, can be left leaning in a shed or garage corner during off season or used in a basement in combination with an umbrella base for inside drying during the winter; just open the top and hoist it upright before inserting the lower section of the pole and you'll have no problem if you have a 7' ceiling."
4,New Clothesline from amazon,"This is a nicely made product. It would be perfect except for one thing; the diameter of the lines are too thin. If the wind blows even a little, the clothes pins cannot hold the laundry on the line. My husband had to restring it with a heavier line. Now it is great."
4,sturdy and strong,"the umbrella is sturdy steel, so it's heavier than my friend's which is made of aluminum. When raising the umbrella, the lines tend to get tangled in the arms, it just takes some getting used to. Overall I love it. We were lazy and didn't do a cement hole,we just hammered in the green post holder, and over one week it the umbrella has settled into the hole just fine. It depends on the soil you have."
1,Would've given a negative start if I could...Item received not as described,Item received was not as was described...was the same clothesline as I could've purchased for half the price under a different item number. Very disappointed but not worth the hassle of returning it.
2,Your money can be better spent.,"I recieved my set a few weeks ago and it's already back were it came from. That is to say, I shipped it back. This is a very low end bit set. The metal box it came in was bent and very difficult to open. Once open, the bits didn't stay in their holdings very well at all. The bits themselves are poor quality. Your better off spending the extra money for a higher quality set."
2,I didn't like the set.......,"I did not get what I expected when I bought this set of drill bits. I was fooled by the too good to be true price. While all the bits were sharp, every one I used (12 bits) on their first project was bent out of the package. I expect bits to be sharp and straight - these were only sharp. They seem to work adequately on thin guage aluminum with a hand drill. If you need a filler set for occasional home projects, this set might be worth the money. If you need precise diameter holes - go elsewhere. Unlike other reviewers, I found the metal case to be adequate - probably by dumb luck, not design. This was my first Yukon tool, and due to it's quality - probably my last."
1,Another,"This Bit Set is one of the biggest pieces of junk I have ever made the mistake of purchasing. The outer case was bent to the point where the lid does not close. The rivets used to attach the hinges were loose. The rivets used to attach the bit carriers to the case had been barely set. Some of the smaller bits were so short they could only be retreived by using tweezers. The length of the bits was bizzare at best. That is, some small diameter bits were an inch longer than other bits with twice the diameter. There was no progression in bit length; instead, the lengths seemed to be totally random. The entire package arrived reeking of oil and the bits were obviously oily. The so-called titanium finish (and it WAS only a finish) looked more like someone had heated the bits in a very hot flame. [...]."
3,"Nice price, great variety... sloppy manufacturing","As one reviewer pointed out, several of the bits are indeed not straight. When first shipped to me, I noted the 5/32 bit was truncated significantly as compared to the rest. I examined the shank and presumed it was inadvertently sheared. I also examined the linear ability of several of the bits--not linear. So, I sent the set back and had a new one resent. Guess what? Same thing. I therefore concluded that Yukon's press makes the 5/32 bit that short. Someone messed up big time when establishing the template for the bit's length. Attention to detail, Yukon!And, just like the first set, several of the bits are not linear. On top of that, even though the bits are sharpened as split points, it would help if Yukon put a little more effort into actually sharpening them! Yikes.All and all, if you need to purchase a set of assorted bits because (very simply, you don't have any), this is a fine choice. Just as long as you have the Drill Doctor on stand by. ;)"
5,Good action movie,"This movie has Chu Man Chuk, who fought against Jet Li in Fong Sai Yuk. The action is really good in this movie, and the plot is actually well developed. There are some gruesome scenes at the end, but overall a good actioner."
5,"The prettiest, wittiest cocktail book I've seen","I love this book! It has so much more to offer than the book I bought at Crate and Barrel for 5x the price. It's quirky and fun and filled with unusual recipes. Great selection of drinks for summer days, cold nights, casual get togethers or swanky cocktail parties. Plus it's filled with tons of hilarious footnotes that are worth quoting while you mix. My favorite drinks (not just because the names are great): the Red Carpet, the Presidential, Silk Stockings, and the Slow Comfortable Screw. You have to try the mojito. This really is the prettiest cocktail book I've seen. Perfect gift item--just tie a bow around it and add a bottle of your friend's favorite alcohol."
1,MUTILATION CD=A WIPE FOR YOUR BOTTOM,"This CD probably wouldn't even make a good boat anchor(it would float instead of sink),in other words most everybody including myself is glad JL America Records is no more. Mutilation is as campy and cheesy as the [weak]artwork on the front cover is. The songs are repetitive and flat out stinks,bland vocals sounds almost like [bad] rap at times,and poor production make this disc forgettable. I could give you at least 666 reasons to avoid this like a diesease but I will just leave with what I said above..."
1,The Being,This was a terrible movie and the only reason I bought it was I was an extra in it. My sister-in-law was the 2nd A.D. on the film. It was good for a laugh.Doug
5,Really good low budget movie,This movie I'd seen years ago always wanted a more modern reboot of its dark almost comedic moments that can't be taken too seriously though fun to watch. Its almost cautious in its message about dumping nuclear waste though that can obviously be ignored. Hopefully reboot will made made soon.
3,"""I' up at the slagheap, with the proffesor..""","Highly overrated. ""The Green Death"" might be UNIT's best story until ""Battlefield"", and Jo Grant has a great emotional send off, with the Doctor trying desperately not to show too much emotion as ""the fledgling flies the coop"". Also, the anti-pollution stance/vegetarian thingy isn't too bad as well. But what undermines a great script from Malcolm Hulke and some pretty decent acting, is the rotten CSO used in this story. It almost looks as though they ran out of money, and had to CSO location work from episodes 4-6! Incredibly embarassing and unintentional hilarious. Even some of the puppet effects aren't all that great. Every scene that uses CSO just doesn't work. What could have been a near-classic turns out to be a more than tolerable Pertwee romp. Like ""Terror of the Autons"" and ""Shada"", highly, highly overrated."
3,A very Detective Doctor Who Story with a Green Peace early 70's flavor,"This Adventure departs fron early 3rd Doctor Who Adventures because it feels like almost a detective adventure , rater than a classic Monster Doctor adventure, Is not bad, it have a early Green -Peace 70's message on it and you see Jo Grant leaving the series in a very great way.It is a little slow adventure, but good in the Jon era."
3,Gross!,"That is what this story is! It has some good scary elements though, like the green glow. I thought it was a good idea how it started down at the mines and they have a bit of an adventure down there.... But I hate it when they skurt past those... giant maggots! But the basic adventuring idea is good. The things he has to do to solve the mystery! The Brigadier gets involved... it's really not what you'd expect until you reach the end.It's a bit sad at the end. Jon looked particularly sad, like it was literal.Has good elements in it, but I marked it down a bit because of the gross maggots in it! I wish they'd substituted it for some other kind of creature! That is the lowest form of life, and that is what makes the story look a bit pitiful.Don't have dinner when you watch it, alright?"
1,VERY BORING,"Like most of Jon Pertwee's era this story sent me to sleep by episode two. Terrible,terrible CSO, and as usual, nauseating musical scores. BOSS is absolutely crap. The most pathetic monster/villain in who's history (seriously, I preferred that green pantomine dragon thing from Warriors). The lighting is atrocious. I could go on and on. Dr Who did not start getting decent until season 14 - I'd avoid purchasing any videos prior to that. I give it one star because it is a very imaginative script and could have worked given a better budget, acting, direction, music etc. The book would probably be better. Otherwise, avoid it."
4,We love GEORGE!!!,"Our family has become HUGE Curious George fans b/c of the PBS show on TV. My 2 kids ages 3 & 1 love the show, so when I came across this adorable George in PJ's I just had to get it! He is SO soft and cuddly. He's the perfect size for little arms to hold. The PJ's and bear are really cute. They were originally sewn on with just a few stitches, but I cut the stitches so my kids could take them off and on. They love dressing George, and cuddling him. He is too cute!!!!"
3,cute george,I looked at similar George's in pajamas that a child could change clothes but they were in a set with others. I got this one instead and was disappointed when the pajamas were sewn on him. The positive is that the teddy bear won't be lost.
4,A cute toy,"My son loves curious george so we thought he would like this toy. It's really more for a collector than a player. The materials are very nice, but george's little toy bear doesn't come off. It is absolutely adorable and my wife thinks it is really cute, but our son just leaves it alone.Also, it comes wrapped in tissue paper, no real packaging. This is perfect if you're buying it for yourself, but if you're getting it as a gift for someone, you may want to buy a small box to put it in before wrapping it up."
4,George,"Bought this toy for my 2 years old, he liked it very much, and now he goes to sleep with his blanket and George. It is well made, soft and perfect for toddlers to cuddle. Just a cute little monkey. And it looks just like the one in the picture."
5,Great Wrench,"Ridgid pipe wrenches are the industry standard for pipe wrenches, and this one lives up to that standard. It's lightweight yet solid feeling. Worth the extra cost to get a high quality USA made tool that will last you a life time."
5,SONY P10 AND THE MPKPHA CASE,I ordered my MPKPHA case from bluemoutain through amazon.com after another company dropped the ball on my order and time was running out before my trip. Bluemoutain came though with great service and a better than expected price.This case worked very well with my Sony P 10 camera. I used it down to 90 feet and made up to 4 dives a day. The camera case was soaked and opened each time without any additional maintainace on this trip. It was easy to use and the pictures were great. The Strobe and the macro feature did most of what I needed and about $1000 less than other brands. If you use a red filter make sure you understand what you are doing and your lighting. This case and the matching filter worked great.Thankyou bluemountain for your great serviceBrian Pfeifer
5,Great marine pack,"This marine pack is great, nice underwater photos. It really don't let water in, but the humidity inside condenses at the marine pack ""lens"" when the pack gets warm, and if that happens, you must open the marine pack and dry the inside.Maybe some ""silica gel"" can do the job, or some sort of anti-fog spray, but I didn't test one of these so far.Anyway, It was a great buy!"
2,Misleading ingredients,"Assuming I have the same box formula made by the Palladio Co., the ingredients don't seem to contain any 'powdered rice'. In fact, they list calcium carbonate, TALC, and fragrance! So, beware. I used this for only one week, and my face was breaking out in areas that never have broken out before! TALC clogs pores.I will say that it did soak up the oil in my skin and lasted fairly long, but I could by any powder that would do the same thing without the clogged pores."
1,not original,this bra insert is not an original invisi. the original invisi that i'd seen is a bra like or breastlike held together as one. the piece that held it as one was cut -off.
1,original invisi silicone bra,I like said about Item being reviewedOriginal Invisi Silicone Bra Inserts ~ Size C ~ NEW my wife did't like look so smale but page look nice thank you
1,"Sticky, too small","Not happy. this item is poorly packaged -- see other reviews -- but not damaged. I was also called. They suggested that I return them for credit, and that was nice.The problem is several in nature. One, they are so thin as to be useless. Two, the inside backing is so sticky that it is painful to remove. Painful. Three, you better get it right the first time because they are extremely difficult to move even a little bit. The material itself is fine, but just not enough of it to matter. I also bought the Invisilooks, and they are perfect."
1,Sticky Gel Pads...Buyer Beware!,"I purchased these inserts for a little lift. I am a C-Cup so I just wanted a little bounce back. The item shipped quite fast but I was very dissapointed when I opened the box. There were no instructions, no title even on the box (just clear plastic wrapped gel inserts). I took the plastic off to insert them into a new bra that I also purchased off amazon and noticed that the gel inserts were covered in some form of sticky adhesive (on both sides). If I put the insert into my bra it would stick perfectly to the bra but it would also adhere itself to my skin which was very uncomfortable. The adhesive wasn't even that strong. It felt like taking a raw piece of steak and putting it into your bra. Ladies...beware....Spend your money on something that is not only better quality but more body-friendly!"
2,Don't stand up,"Oh, my goodness...I cought them at about my knees. I had to sit down very quickly,run to the bathroom and take them both off. Good thing it was intermission durring a play and not a party. I followed the instructions. i will stick duct tape for now."
4,Return To Snowy River was good!!,I thought that Return To Snowy River was good. But not as good as the first one.(The Man From Snowy River) That could be because I had heard the first one alot more than the second one!!
1,Return to Snowy River-Soundtrack,I thought I ordered the video not the soundtrack. And I don't know how to return it for a refund.
4,Ecofeminism edited by Karen J. Warren,This is an excellent book for anyone interested in ecofeminist theory. It contains a collection of essays by various authors on ecological problems and how those problems are linked to the oppression of minorities.It contains empirical data to back claims and provides a clear convincing argument for the movement.
3,You Can Wish In One Hand,"Let's be frank here. I watched this video because Sophia Loren was in it. And it was well worth the time. Not only is Sopia lovely, but she performs well in this light comedy.But what really made the film for me was the outstanding performance of Burgess Meridith. I bought the DVD just so I can go to all the places where he does his stuff. In his role as ""Pop"" he was absolutely perfect. His little one-liners, his discourse on bacon, his outrageous flirting with the Moma, his singing to the grand daugther.... well, suffice it to say that he steals every scene he is in. He alone would be worth the price of the movie.If you are looking for a relaxing and mildly amusing film, this one will do the trick. If you are looking for profound meaning and excitement, forget about this one."
5,"I hated the first one, but this is a keeper!","A friend of mine rented the original ""Grumpy Old Men,"" and told me I should see it. Although it had ""moments,"" it seemed uneven and, well, stupid. This sequel is one of the rare times when a sequel is actually better than the original. It is almost as if the film makers had to make the first to see what it was that they had -- or rather the potential of what they *could* have. Grumpier delivers in a way the first never did. Now this is a sequel to try to top!!"
3,Grumpy old men on romance,"It is unusual to find sequels that turn out better than the first, but Grumpier old men seems to have taken the cake. At least it kept me awake and somewhat interested, a feat that the first one could not accomplish.Although the movie deals with older men, ok, very old men and their romantic situations, the movie is not that bad. Its almost a relief to see a movie that doesn't have the cream of the crop the only ones that can fall in love. However most of the jokes fall on uncaring ears as we of the younger generation know absolutely nothing of the trials of old bones and short tempers that come from such things. Plus, admit it, most of us don't try to think whats the better way to die. Quietly or having a heart attack while on a fishing trip. No disrespect intended.If you didn't like the first movie, give the second one a try. It could or could not be redeemable, but hey! It could give you a different way to view the older generation."
3,only in full frame!,I can't believe that in all the reviews of this film (which along with the first movie is great)only one or two people even care or metion the fact these films are 4:3. Are most people still watching movies on 4:3 televisions. I love these films but won't buy them till they are in widescreen.
5,Ann Margret and Sophia Loren are never too old to be sexy.,Great movie. A third in the series would have been even better. It just goes to show you that older is better.
1,Grumpier Young Reviewer!,"I LOVE the movie Grumpier Old Men but I DON'T love that the movie on DVD is only available in the edited full-screen and not the original theatrical aspect ratio in wide-screen, there are movies that are terrible that are available in wide-screen but a great movie like Grumpier Old Men is not and that just isn't right! The movie would get 5 stars but the full-screen DVD only gets 1 star."
2,Mediocre at best,"While the concept of this device is good, its problems are:1) you need the remote control to turn the unit on. If the battery dies or the remote control is out of reach you cannot turn the unit on manually.2) my unit stopped working after four months and when I looked at the warranty it's only for 3 months... and the warranty isn't in effect unless you registered the item 30 days from purchase.I wouldn't recommend this item. I'm sure there has to be something better out there."
2,"Cheap construction, not fully functional","I bought the DLO Homedock for use with an older 15gb iPod. While I was relatively pleased with the look of the thing, I found upon close inspection that the construction was actually pretty cheap and shoddy, particularly for equipment of this price.Upon use, I found the following:Pros:Playlist switching remote buttons. For some reason many iPod docks lack this obvious feature.Cons:Three of the buttons (shuffle on/off, backlight on/off, repeat on/off) simply do not work. Perhaps this is because I am using it with an older iPod, but that still seems pretty lame.Sound quality is mediocre, provided cables are of poor quality.Dock does not seem to turn the iPod off when powered down.Video out supports photo or movie viewing but does not support a browsing interface while listening to music.Overall, I am not impressed with this product and will be returning it for something that works better."
2,Still needs work,"The HomeDock is nice looking, but there are fundamental flaws that make it unacceptable for most entertainment systems. These are:- Unresponsive remote. The remote works of you aim it just right. But if you're off by a few degrees or don't push the buttons just so, then nothing happens.- Menu missing the navigation capability of the iPod. If you want to do anything more than jump to the next song/picture, you have do this directly with the iPod.- Menu not visible on the screen. Given that you can't do much with the remote, this isn't such a big deal. But this would be a necessary ingredient to what is really needed to include the iPod in an entertainment system.I'm still looking for a piece of equipment that solves the problem that the HomeDock is suppose to solve. It seems pretty obvious: a docking station that allows users to use the iPod audio and video features remotely as if controlling the iPod directly. I have not found such a thing yet; hopefully someone is working on it.."
2,Poor sound with loud noise,"I connected this dock with a Ipod Video to a Marantz Receiver with B&W; speakers. The sound is distorted and with static sound that is present even with the Ipod paused; I tried everything from change the outlet connector to degauss the dock but nothing worked.It looks nice but when you have it in your hand you can feel how cheap the construction is, confirmed by the static sound. Do not buy this unit, look for other docks, specially from HiFi manufactures like Marantz, Denon, Onkyo, Harman Kardon etc."
3,"Expensive, but decent until...","The battery died on my remote. You cannot turn the stupid thing on when the remote doesn't work. I remembered struggling to get the battery in the remote when I first got it, but nothing compared to now. I have been trying to pry it open with a screwdriver and still cannot get it open. I will likely just have to break it. The remote is a piece of junk.Otherwise, I was fairly happy with it."
1,Keeps Causing my Receiver to Shut Down,"After using this product maybe half a dozen times it started causing my new Sony receiver to shut down with a flashing ""Protect"" message on the receiver. When I checked the warranty I saw they give you a whole 90 days, what a surprise. This product is total trash and should be avoided at all costs."
2,Remote,I have only had the dock for about 3 months and the remote stopped working. I purchased a new battery and it still doesn't work. I now ordered another remote from the DLO website for another 18 dollars - this is really lame because you can't turn it on with out this cheap little remote. Horrible.
2,MAJOR Design Flaw,"I purchased this product so that I could run my iPod through my main stereo. Overall, I was fine with the connectivity of the product to my stereo and the sound quality. However, this product has a HUGE design flaw that renders it practically useless - you can only power on the device using the remote, and as other posts have reported, the remote is garbage. My remote worked OK for about a month, then I had to replace the battery (after very minor usage), and now the remote doesn't work at all. I had been leaving it on all of the time, but after a thunderstorm caused me to lose power, I cannot turn the device on. Now I simply have a $100 display stand for my iPod..."
2,eh,"i got this as a gift and when i hooked it up to my speakers it sounded awful(and i have amazing speakers so i knew it wasnt their fault), it was stacticy and if i turned up my speaker volume and the docks volume down it beeped and was staticy. i havent exchanged it yet but my advice is go with something cheaper."
5,"Simple, Effective Home Theater iPod Docking Solution","I looked everywhere for an easy to connect, yet sleek looking, iPod docking solution for Denon home theater solution and was really disappointed in the available products until I found the HomeDock. Rated a Very Good by CNET and really helped in my decision to purchase. See the following link for the review: [...]Pros: S-Video, RCA Video and USB interconnects allow for a very easy, straightforward, and FAST installation that works with multiple generations of iPods. Sound quality is excellent and can be leveraged in any number of environments from a home office, home theater, or direct to your television. Very easy to show pictures, video (much cheaper than buying an AppleTV for $229), all while charging your iPod and controlling of 14 separate iPod functions.Cons: Somewhat limited remote range, S-video cable not included (but can be purchased online for under $5)"
1,Quick install but beware... Remote is an issue,"When I purchased this product, I was pleasantly surprised at the easy and simple connection to our amplifier. Sound quality was great to our hard-wired sound system. I agree with other reviewers that the remote is somewhat temperamental but functioned. HOWEVER, after using the dock for 7 months, it suddenly quit. I called technical support and was told that seating my ipod on the dock should cause the light to go on regardless of the remote. No such luck. I'll probably shell out more $ for a battery for the remote but doubt it will solve my problem based on the advice I received from DLO tech support - their suggestion... buy a new unit. Based on the advice of other users, I removed the battery from the remote, banged it, reinserted the same battery and the unit turned on. It's working right now but not sure what will happen when I turn it off."
4,This is a great product.,"Simple to use, easy to install and great for playlist or random play. If you are looking for something to totally control your ipod, this is not the product."
3,A great product with one major flaw,"I bought this product and it came with a remote that worked only 15% of the time. I had to bang it on the table to get it to work. Thankfully, I was able to turn the base on, and I have left it on since. Now, the remote works 0% of the time. Worse yet, on the JLO website, the link that directs consumers to purchase a replacement remote is broken. What a pain. I think JLO rushed to get this product out to establish itself in market shortly after the iPod Video was released. I don't know if the Deluxe version is more reliable, but, I would suggest shelling out a few more $$ for it if it is, in fact. You'll save save yourself from the pain of headaches and frustration. I gave it 3 stars because watching TV shows downloaded from iTunes is a great concept.Caveat emptor! Buyer beware!"
3,A pain to use,"This product claims it can be used without needing to remove most skins. I have a Mini and cannot use the HomeDock without removing the skin. I have 2 different brands of skins, neither is compatable. If you believe in protecting your iPod with a case or skin, which I believe you should, you will find the HomeDock is a pain to use."
3,A half-complete but nice attempt at a soundtrack,"Too much great missing music to call this a soundtrack, should be retitled: Selections from the Original Soundtrack. What's missing? Try music from Bauhaus, Iggy pop, David Lawson, Howard Blake, Edouard Lalo, Maurice Ravel, Gregorio Allegri, and even a key Schubert sonata piece!I've owned this soundtrack for the nearly thirty years or so it's been out, but half-love what's on there; the Rubini-Jaeger original score is a bit grating (except for the beautiful 'Beach House' vocal by Stephanie Spruill -- though not in the movie!). So, I must give it a 3-star rating due to its great missing material. Hopefully, someone might produce a comprehensive soundtrack for the film's 30th anniversary (2013) since they've missed-the-boat on the 25th."
5,Simply amazing music but missing something,"The music on this disk is as eclectic as the movie from which it derives. Also top quality. I was, however, sadly surprised to see a key music title missing, namely """"Bela Lugosi's Dead"" by band Bauhaus. Really it should have been in there with the Bach and Mozart. Other than that, an excellent listen."
3,"Wanted 3 songs, got one","Sought this out for the Delibes, the Lalo and especially the fantastically moody Ravel ""Gaspard de la Nuit-Le Gibet"". Well, I got one of the 3 at least. And of course, remember that the Lalo ""is a bit sacharrin"".The other atmospheric music isn't bad, I guess I just like the classical more. Maybe someday they will do a rerelease of this CD and add the other missing music that everyone else keeps saying should be on the disc and isn't. I will be waiting. Forever and forever."
1,Best Song Missing,"Granted, ""Lakme"" by ""Delibes"" and others are wondrous earfuls to the classically minded audience. But what happened to the opening piece by Bauhaus, ""Bela Lugosi's Dead"" ??? Smart marketers would have worked a deal with this brilliant underground artrock band, and come up with a 4 to 4-1/2 minute masterful edit (since we don't hear TOO much of this classic, but ENOUGH of it, at the very beginning of the movie; sufficient to set the mood and tone of this neo-gothic story), perfect to round out this otherwise brilliant soundtrack.Yet without ""Bela ...,"" this ""Hunger"" soundtrack leaves the listener STARVING! And that's why this album earns a single star alone.Don't bother playing THIS album at any Halloween parties. Perhaps wine tasting sessions only.Bottom line: Soundtrack without the opening Bauhaus song doesn't capture THE SPIRIT of the film at all.Put Bauhaus on there!Otherwise: It's a limp-wristed rip off."
3,ETHEREAL CREEPY LIKE MOVIE BUT FALLS SHORT.,"THE MUSIC SET TO TONY SCOTTS DIRECTION FIT LIKE A GLOVE. IT HELPED THE MOVIE ACHEIVE A CREEPY UNWORLDLY QUALITY. UNFORTUNELY THE MUSIC ON THIS DISK IS NOT THE SAME ARRANGEMENT, BAUHAUS ""BELI LUGOSIS DEAD"" IS SORRILY MISSING WHICH REALLY SET THE TONE OF THE MOVIE. BUT SCHUBERT AND BACH ARRANGEMNTS ARE IN AND THEY ARE WORTH THE PRICE AND MAKE UP FOR LOST MATERIAL."
3,tailgate cap,Great product. Had to add a couple of self tapping screws screws but other than that Its a. Great product.
2,Save your money...download Windows Movie Maker,I purchased the product hoping to burn family videos to DVD. I found that you had to purchase the MPEG add on to do so. I also wanted the ability to add menus to the DVD so it doesn't play like an old fashioned video tape...the product doesn't do that. I found that this product does not offer any more functionality more than Windows Movie Maker which is available for free download from the MicroSoft site. I'm sending the product back.
1,MPEG for another $...,No mention of the fact that you will have to pay an additional $... to get an MPEG plug-in until you try to use the program (which by the way both my Sony Digital Camcorder and my Sony Digital Camera spit out in the MPEG format - but their software won't work with it).You had best compare this to similar products that run around a $... because once they're done with you at Screenblast that's what you'll have into it!
1,A dissapointment,"In comparison to comparbly priced products, I found this software to be less functional and more complicated. As stated by others, I too am extremely put off by the fact that you have to purchase additional modules in order to export videos as mpeg's. This is a feature that is fundamental to burning video cd's and to much of the video editing world!! The only positive aspect to me is the fact that the software did not lock up and ran very smoothly for me compared to Video Deluxe 2. If, however, Video Deluxe were to actually work as advertised without locking up, there would be no contest in terms of price, funtionality and overall satisfaction. The quest for the perfect video software continues..."
2,Too hard,"I have to say I was a little disappointed. The licorice cats were too hard and didn't have enough licorice flavor. I finished all of them, but will not buy them again."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Although I like to consider myself open to 'cultural cuisine', I found myself spitting this stuff out - after paying about $6 for it at a international marketplace. My significant other did the same. I like salty stuff, and I love licorice, but this was just plain nasty. Not only was it too salty, but it had a terrible rubbing-alcohol-type flavor that went up to my nose and made me wonder if perhaps the candy had been tampered with or manufactured incorrectly. I went online and read some other reviews...other people have had similar experiences. I guess it's one of those acquired tastes that has to be developed early. Oh, those Dutch!! I love 'em (but hate this ""candy"")!"
4,Good Dutch Licorice,"This is the traditional Dutch licorice. Half salt. If you have acquired the taste, you will enjoy these coins. The containers do not reseal unless you push very hard and the candy needs to be stored in an airtight container after opening."
2,Salty!,"These just arrived in the mail. I was looking for a treat, instead I got salty black coins, the package says no sodium but something in there tasted so salty I can't eat them. I do not recommend that you buy these unless you have had them before and know what to expect."
1,These USED to be great,"These used to be great, just the right texture, with a great authentic licorice taste. Not any more. These were terrible. They tasted stale and crumbly, and did they forget to add the licorice? Yuck."
4,Creative Critique,"Very good product for the price. I use it on my work station PC and it is great. Turn on or off as needed, completely satisified, may even buy another set for my scanner radio!"
3,Large Case poor zipper,I purchased this case after checking on Garmin's website saything this was the case to purchase for the 62s gps. The intent for the case was to keep dust off the until while I ride my dirtbike. I attached the case to my camelbak using the beltloop on the back of the case. I found this zipper to work well as long as I had two hands available to properly pull the zipper seam to make it work. However when It was on my pack I found it difficult to open and close the zipper. I imagine that it would have been easier had it been slightly smaller in size so the unit fit better. Not a terrible product but I would go with a different case next time.
3,Cheap quality but gets the job done,"This carrying case is of cheap quality, like a kids' pencil case; but gets the job done."
2,Too BIG!,"This case is just way too big for my GPS. After selecting the Garmin eTrex Vista HCx GPS from Amazon, I made sure I selected the correct case by first going to the Garmin website to confirm Amazon's recommendation. Garmin showed this case and part number for the GPS so I also ordered it from Amazon at the same time as the GPS. When I received it, it was obviously way too big. You could probably fit 3 eTrex Vista GPS' in that case. I think Garmin must have determined size of their largest portable GPS and created this case, thinking any and all Garmin GPS' would fit.I didn't cut into the plastic packaging, so Amazon took it back and refunded the price. I had to pay shipping though since it was my (really Garmin's) mistake. I found a generic bag for the GPS that fit a lot better than the one by Garmin. I gave the case 2 stars only because of the bad fit. Otherwise I didn't see anything wrong or inferior about the product."
5,Great carrying case,"I was searching for a carrying case for my Garmin GPSMAP 76CSx if you are too, this is a perfect fit for just the unit, with very little wiggle room."
3,Almost completely satisfied,The case came with my GPS and it fits perfectly and has a convenient belt loop. The one thing I would like to have had is a pocket to carry my adapter cable for the car lighter.
3,Gets the job done for a carrying case,The carrying case is basic and gets the job done. I suggest that it have a separate pocket for spare batteries and the USB cable.
3,"Ok, nice tough case but too short for Rhino series","Just as the title says, ""ok, nice tough case but too short for Rhino series"". Very tight fit for Rhino and have to squeeze antenna in."
1,Too Short,The case does not fit the Rino 655t that I have. It is too short and when I tried to zip it closed by bending over the antenna the stress caused the pull tab to to break from the zipper.
4,I like it,"The case is nice. It fits my Garmin GPSMAP 62s perfectly. Wish I got this a while ago. It appears well built but still is pricey for what is literally a ""small bag""."
1,Open all orders right away.,"I recieved the box in the time stated,however I did not open the box as I trusted that I had recieved the ordered product.When I did open the box ordered I was shocked to find that the package had been opened,and a case from Fieldpiece had been substituted,even-tho the package was from Garmin.I should have returned the oder but the two 10 day time limit had exspired.I will have to eat the bag or find another use. I will order again but I will open all products as soon as I recieve them.Thanks; Bobbie Ray Brown"
4,Nice case,I purchased this case for my Garmin GPSmap 76C. Fits perfectly. My only wish is that it had a spot to put the car charger so it wouldnt get seperated from the GPS.
4,A good protection for your handheld GPS as the only or extra case,"I bought this case to go along with an eTrex GPS. It has plenty of room for the GPS and the ""quick reference card,"" and I can even wedge the car charger in the case if I take my time. For added protection on a snowmobile or ATV etc. it seems great. I bought a Gilsson case which totally encloses the GPS in neoprene and clear plastic over the buttons and screen. I would recommend that if you are only going to buy one case for outdoor use. If your using the eTrex in your car or for walking or for added protection (I don't care to beat on $250 technological equipment...) I think the couple extra bucks for some extra protection or a light duty or spare bag is well spent. If it was a hair larger it would've been perfect to put the car adapter in with the neoprene case, but I didn't design it =)"
3,Barely fits Rino 655T,"Nice case for storing Garmin GPS when in transport. Not a functional case for in use though.It just barely zips over the antenna of my Garmin Rino 655t. Potential for a broken zipper in the future I'd guess.Thin padding may help for a drop, but not secure enough for serious protection."
3,good quality but kinda small,I have an '84 Chevy truck with factory bench seat and the back rest of the seat is too tall for the cover to completely go over. Also it is held one with lightweight strings that you tie to random places which some broke from sliding in and out. Other than that im happy with the material quality and even has pockets sewn in all across the front for small storage. Seems like it would of been fine on smaller seats.
2,DOES NOT FIT FULL SIZE BENCH SEAT,"Look closely at the picture provided. This is clearly for a mini - to mid size bench seat.Yes it's inexpensive. Yes it's ""universal"".But, when all is said and done, wouldn't you want accuracy in the description of the product you are buying?Move on, find something better if you need to cover a bench seat in any vehicle with size.Too bad, I thought Saddleman would be one of the brands you could trust to decribe their own product accurately.I would have paid more, if they told me too. Just give me the option of buying the right item.Yeah, I'm not going to waste my time - returning it, finding another, etc. etc.- Just DONT BUY THIS FOR FULL IZE APPLICATION"
1,Poor quality,My husband took this out of the box and immediately said send it back. The design is such that it would not stay on the seat at all. I returned it right away.
5,Excellent boook,"This text is based on the work put into the www.nysora.com website over the past several years.The book covers a pretty wide collection of regional blocks, but omits dealing with spinals and epidurals.Each block is explained covering the essential anatomy, surface anatomy, detailed technique and sevceral practical tips and hints for when things do not go quite according to plan.I recommend the text very highly"
1,i did not recive my item yet,pleas i did not know what happend to myrequest becaus i did not recieved my orderaltough yuo had dedducted the fee from my vesa card
4,Modern Southern Humor At It's Best,"Tim Wilson takes an uncommon look at southern life and current issues. His blend of humor and music will make you laugh out loud. Comedic dialog is sprinkled with humorous songs ranging from the name ""George"" to Country-Fied-Beer-Guzzling-Elvis aliens."
5,Oh My GOD!,Holy crap! I can't even believe such musical prowess exists. I fell down and hurt my knee the first time I heard this and I lost my glasses! This CD is lovely!
2,What About Price?,"This book was exactly the same as the other book by George, only George's book included more springs. It was somewhat informative, even though all the information is 10 years old. Unfortunately for me, I found a website that has all the same information included in the book, so there really is no need to buy it unless you want all that information in a binding. The most disappointing thing was that no pricing information was included. Mr. Wambach should have realized that the price is one of the most important factors for most people, especially since some springs are $10/day and others cost hundreds. The book was useful in finding things to do in the area, if you can pull yourself away from the pools long enough to do something else. Sure would like to see a guide with the prices included. It would also be fantastic if a newer guide were written."
2,Outdated,"Thought the cover looks fresh, the content is outdated. A number of the hot springs featured in the book have changed names, been expanded, etc. A new edition of this book needs to be published!"
5,1994 Classic! DO NOT SLEEP,"Breakin' Combs is a 1994 Hiphop Gem, now out-of print and hard to find Dred Scott never got the recognition he deserved for this. This album is for any hiphop fan of that NY sound for its typical early 90's feel with the horns and drums, and the general jazzy summer vibe it brings. This album has been slept on since the day it was dropped and probably explains why D scott is not about any more doing his thing. Do yourself a favour and peep this and you may find you have stumbled across a personal favourite. Peace!Lyrics - 10/10Beats - 10/10Originality - 10/10Replay Value - 9/10Best Tracks - ALL OF 'EM, IT's TOO CONSISTENT!If you found this helpful, check out my other reivews"
5,boraxo,good product. very hard to find in my area so am glad I can get it online without having to go to another area to try and find it
2,Not what I was looking for,"This product cleans okay, but is not what I thought it would be, lacking the wonderful scent of the old twenty mule team borax that I was looking for."
2,Just Didn't Make It,"The seller told me he had sent the book out a day or so later, but it never made it to me. This is why tracking is a good idea."
3,Required Book for College Class,Required Book for my College Class. Print ends up a little small but interesting content.
4,CRYPT knows how to do it!,"I own volumes 1 and 2 (both outstanding)and I'm ecstatic I bought Vol.3! This CD is wild, quirky, teen rock created in the ""garages"" of America circa '63-67. I'm fascinated that these songs were even in existence when mainstream pop ruled the AM airwaves. The bands on this CD play rock for primal outlet, cathartic screamings,hell bent energy,and FUN! Check out The Keggs (Track 9) -- they sound almost out of tune and then the song comes together in what is one of my favorite tracks (they were big fans of The Kinks). I plan to buy all of Crypts'""BACK FROM THE GRAVE"" recordings as long as they keep putting them out. These ""Back From The Grave"" collections are a fun, well put together look into an important part of American rock history. Even the liner notes on all of CRYPT'S CDs are insightful, honest, and a laugh riot."
5,The future of H&H Modeling,"This book provides an overview of not only the theory and computational methodologies of both Hydraulic and Hydrologic modeling in ArcView, but provides real world modeling examples. This publication is a great quick overview of cutting edge modeling. Note that most of the Corp of Engineering extensions show cased in this book require that you are using ArcView 3.x and they currently do not run on ArcGIS 8."
1,Too many inaccuracies,"If the authors of this book spent so much time researching (11 years according to the Kirkus Review above) then one wonders why their historical contextualization is as sloppy and superficial as it is. Let me cite one egregious example. On page 274, the authors explain that Elia Kazan's naming names fed Joe McCarthy's ambition which resulted in the blacklisting of the Hollywood 10. In fact, McCarthy had absolutely nothing to do with the Hollywood 10 (who were blacklisted in 1947--McCarthy didn't rise to fame until 1950), and Elia Kazan wasn't brought before HUAC until years later. Any high school history textbook will be clear about this. Also, the melodramatic quality of this book, especially in its fictionalized dialogues, leads the reader to question whether the authors had any intention of writing a factual book, or whether they wanted to invent a history that was dramatic and would sell a lot of copies."
4,fascinating read,"I thought this was a very interesting book that painfully illustrated what greed and a thirst for power can do to a family. It was a bit choppily written but the subject matter was so interesting it didn't matter. I would recommend this book to any fan of Hollywood legend and lore. Jack Warner was a selfish, thoughtless, power hungry man who forsook his own son for a shrew of a woman, and he took a few of his brothers down on his power trip. So interesting to see how difficult life was for immigrants, how hard they worked, how imaginative they were, so far-seeing and daring int he risks they were willing to take. It might explain some of the greed and need to be in control---but it doesn't explain why one brother could be a good man, and the next brother a man without a conscience. A very fast and entertaining read."
3,Over priced,"The link on Google says this wrench costs $68. When you get here, it is $90. It is available elsewhere for less."
2,Only an abridgement,"Like the Carolinne White translation of the ""Confessions,"" also carried by Amazon, this paperback does not have the complete original text. Rather, some of the ideas have been selected out by someone and are here rephrased into more contemporary language. That's OK, but anyone buying this book ought to know that this version is an abridgement and not the full text of the ""Confessions"" that they're buying."
2,This part must fit perfectly,This product must fit the camera perfectly and not become dismantled in mid of shooting photos. Currently this idea of an adopter for wide angle closeup is a good one but it must fit the camera as though the camera was built for its usage.
2,badly made,i bought this as a time saver seem to spend much of that time repairing the rivets that holdthe jig against the door or frame the pins that fall out and fitting different shims and filing down bits in all a waste of time and money
1,NOT USER FRIENDLY,"THERE ARE SEVERAL DISAPOINTMENTS WITH THIS KIT. 1st. THERE IS NO ROOM IN THE CARRYING CASE FOR THE 4th. HINGE TEMPLATE. 2nd. THEY MAKE THE TEMPLATE SO THAT YOU HAVE TO USE THERE ROUTER GUIDE. 3rd. THERE GUIDES CAN ONLY BE USED IN BOSH ROUTERS. 4th. THEY DO NOT MAKE AN ADAPTER SO THAT YOU CAN USE THER GUIDE ON OTHER ROUTER'S. AFTER ASKING THEM HOW CAN I GET THERE TEMPLATE GUIDE TO WORK WITH MY HITACHI OR POTACABLE ROUTERS, THERE REPLY WAS TO BUY A BOSH ROUTER. MY SUGGESTION WOULD BE UNLESS EVERY TOOL YOU OWN IS A BOSH DONT BOTHER. PORTACABLE MAKES A GOOD KIT FOR LESS, AND YOU DONT HAVE TO USE ONLY THERE BRAND GUIDES AND ROUTERS."
3,Not universal,"The Bosch hinge template is a descent portable kit to route out the hinges on a door. What I have found is that most of these types of kits all work the same with pretty much the same quality. However, I prefer the Porter Cable kit because this Bosch only works with Bosch tools it isn't universal where the Porter Cable one is. I hope this helps someone before they purchase the wrong one."
4,A small survey essay,"This short survey of the 'Biography' focuses primarily on English biography. It gives most prominent place naturally to Boswell's ' Life of Johnson'. Shelston writes of it ,"" Boswell's 'Life of Johnson thus fulfills Johnson's own requirements for biography; it records the domestic details of a life which affords moral instruction: while the proximity of the author and subject are such as to ensure as nearly as possible the authenticity that ideally, can only come from autobiography'.Shelston also writes of other landmarks in English biography, Strachey's 'Eminent Victorians'. He discusses Virginia Woolf's writings about biography, and also the monumental Henry James biography of Leon Edel.In early chapter of the work he discusses Biography's relation to History and Drama.In our time the writing of Biography is no longer a minor genre but a major industry. Shelston does not however delve deeply into developments of the twentieth century."
3,Howd ya do that?,"First off,this is vhs conversion to dvd item and the quality of course is not that good.In this video brian shows his virtuoso skills very niceley but you must keep in mind this dvd is not aimed at the beginner.only a good intermediate player can make good use of watching the split window examples.The demonstrations can be very intimidating for the beginner and the quality of the booklet included is very shoddy.Brian should really come out with his own.He would make a mint.This was shot in 92 so i think a second dvd would be much better thought out.This dvd is staying with me until i am a better player though.I would have bought it even if i wasnt a student just to watch brian noodle around!Great fun!Oh yeah,the looping on the slow mo is very helpful but on screen tabs are barely readable."
2,Not Very Good,"I have owned this video lesson for about 3 years now and have gone back to it many times. First of all, Brian is entertaining in the video and plays awesome, however, he never provides the detail as an instructor to analyze his playing. You can learn some cool licks from this video, but not understand how or why they were constructed.Definitely not a beginners' video and I would not recommend it. There really are some better rockabilly instruction videos out there that would serve you better."
2,horrible quality,"Let me start by saying this is a review of the physical media, not he content. My video froze 1 minute and 1 second in. The video quality is a bad VHS transfer. It has lines throughout tat make it difficult to even watch in slow motion. The book and cover art look like they were photo copied at Kinko's. I am returning because it is not usable. Definately not with $20. Feels like a bootleg, not a real produced video lesson."
3,Extremely dry hair after using - would be good for very oily hair,"Nice aroma, rather like chocolate-covered cherries oddly enough - not the usual camomille odor, and golden color. Left my hair so dry it was fluffy(Poofy), but extremely brittle. Would be fabulous for very oily hair, but too dry for mine."
1,An Inaccurate and Polemic Work,"This is perhaps one of the most inaccurate and propagandized literary works done on the Babi movement. I have studies its history and literature for several years, as I continue to persue my graduate degree in Near Eastern Studies at Princeton University. My conclusion is that the facts are misconstrued to fix an alterior objective--perhaps a dogmatic religious prejudice that emerges within the Ahmaddiy sect of Islam."
3,Wonderful movie....horrible ending!!,"I love this typical love story. Michelle and Robert have beautiful chemisty together on the screen! The only problem it ends 30 mins TOO long!! The perfect ending is, well..stop the movie right as they hug after the prison riot. After that it's all downhill, and it's better if you use your imagination."
3,This Widescreen DVD is a like a cropped Fullscreen picture,"On a 40 inch Sony flatscreen this 1:85 aspect ratio equates to a black framing on this picture of 5 inches off the side and 3 inches on the top and bottum of your screen. So if you have an old VHS version of this movie you might consider if the improved picture quality is worth the loss of the size of the picture.The romance between Redford and Pfeiffer is believable, and the story is well written. Hopefully this film will get a proper BD widescreen upgrade in the future. When that happens, this will become a five star movie experience for any collection."
3,BEAUTIFUL ROMANTIC STORY,DON'T NEED TO THINK TOO HARD ; KIND OF MOVIE YOU WANNA WATCH AT NIGHT WHEN YOU ARE TOO TIRED TO THINK... BUT THE CHEMESTRY BETWEEN THE 2 ACTORS IS BEAUTIFUL & THEY ARE GIVING A GOOD SOLID PERFORMANCE. HOWEVER BOTH OF THEM DID BETTER
2,Get out your suspension of disbelief!,"This movie was interesting enough to keep me watching to the end but I was disappointed. Maybe I missed the point, but it seemed to me that almost nothing about this movie was real. Robert Redford's character wore clothes and had furniture that seemed mostly lifted from the Sundance Catalog. Michelle Pfeiffer's character never seemed to be doing any research but rather staying late at work to play solitaire on her computer. And we later are expected to believe that she gets up from her wedding bed to work at her laptop on a news story. I found it a sad reflection on Hollywood's take on American values and an insult to the viewer's intelligence."
5,Pretty much the best movie,"I must say I'm shocked this film was overlooked when it came to the big awards.Why do the Oscar voters hate love so much? Is it because they're all shallow phonies out of touch with real human emotion? I think we all know the answer to those questions, right?Heck, I don't go around calling people names and feeling good about it. But when a film of this caliber is called ""drivel"" by one critic and ""horse manure"" by another. It sort of gets my goat, you see where I'm going with this?And another thing, just because something has a happy ending doesn't mean it's not an artistic success, understood? I could write all day about how real art needs to reflect life and be honest about the miserableness of life, but who wants to read realistic views like that, you follow?Anyway, Redford really phones in a great performance and Michelle P. is radiant as a TV reporter with mad skills and a questionable attitude."
4,Get ready to burst into tears,"Two of the greatest and sexiest movie stars of all time team up in this emotional drama that will drive you to tears. Redford, as always, is impossibly intelligent and indescribably admirable. Pfeiffer steals the show with her beauty and charm and the unforgettable performance of ""The Impossible Dream"". And the incredible acting of both plus Celine Dion's ""Because you love me"" make the film a movie classic. It's the story of two people - a young woman in search of a career in television industry, her rise from secretary to weather person and finally a true TV star, and an experienced newsman, who believes in her, helps her rise and falls for her. You'll be shocked in the end.... Don't miss it."
1,Terrible,"This was a bad movie in every way. I used to think Redford a bit magic, because he was in nothing but good movies. But in this one, you can see he's just a grown man who plays make-believe for a living. As all actors do. But before, the illusion held. This movie made the illusion shatter. In scene after scene, I thought, ""Oh, I think I'm supposed to care here."" But I never cared for the characters for a second."
1,Among the worst films in recent years!!!,"An absolutely load of tripe of a plot, that could be made convincing given the right director, is turned into a down right embarrassing tale that doesn't even warrent the word ""corny"". There is absolutely no sexual chemistry between the two main stars, Redford being far too old for Pfeiffer, there's virtually no plot at all and what there is a risible ""romance"" among the embarrassing world of the American Media. After Paul Verhoeven poured scorn over the media in ""Ropocop"" its a wonder anyone had the stupidity to make a serious film about it."
3,Hearts will be beating.,"Up Close & Personal is frothy romantic comedy/drama. The best thing about this film is Michelle Pfeiffer, I think she is a talented actress, she can play any type of role. Robert Redford is also good in this, the only problem I have with this film is the weepy ending. The premise of the film is good but poorly directed. This is definitely a chick flick, nice movie to watch with best friends, enjoy!"
1,Don't waste your Cash,If I could give this DVD a zero I would. It was a complete waste of money and the time it took to watch (even using fast forward it was a waste. WIthout a doubt this is the worst Cane DVD I have ever seen. usually I can find at least a few interesting or effective moves or insights in a DVD. Not in this one. We were so disappointed in it that I threw it in the trash after the first viewing.
2,serviceable surf,"If you like genuine early '60's surf, then this has 32, run of the mill, cookie-cutter examples from that genre. Me, I'm going to take my copy down to the used CD store and trade it in. But I don't like surf that much. Bought it on impulse."
1,"Don't waste your money..invest in ""Monster High"" DVD releases..","Boring.. you can tell this was never going anywhere..kids won't enjoy this.. plenty of other good ""scary"" toons for your little ones at Halloween..avoid this one unless you are desperate for something new.."
2,More horrifying than any monster,"When I picked this movie for my kids, I thought it would be a cute and entertaining movie, judging by the box art. However, I was wrong. For starters, the art seems to be done in flash animation, which I have no problem with. It's just that it's doesn't look smooth. The characters animations look like they're one of the paper dolls you can buy at a doller store. Second the jokes are terrible, at least acording to my kids when I bought this ( they were 9 at the time.) and the episodes are dull. In short, don't buy this, you could just watch another Halloween cartoon, like the Peanuts one."
4,A Great Book,"In the Year of the Boar and Jackie Robinson is a great book. I didn't fall in love with it because I am not someone who loves to go home, sit down and read for 15 minutes or more unless I have totally fallen in love with the book. Otherwise it is a great story with a good lesson and a little bit of humor.The story is about a little girl with a nickname of ""Bandit."" When she finds out she's moving from China to America she gets the name ""Shirley Temple."" When she moves to America she has trouble fitting in and making friends.Later in the story she finds out about baseball and is crazy about Jackie Robinson. All throughout the story she misses her family all year, so be sure to read to find out what big surprises Shirley has at the end of the story."
2,a slow read,This book was a slow read for me because I could not get into the book. This book did not a have the action I like in a book. It had a good message of how to handle bullying when gets out of control. The book had a lot of vocab words. If you like a happy book without a lot of confrentation this would be a great book for you! This book was not my favorite but it did have a good message.
4,In The Year Of The Boar And Jakie Robinson.,"""The sea was; deep green like jade."" The book In The Year of the Boar And Jakie Robinson is a book with good word choice and great descirption. It is a great short read with many interesting things going on. It is about a young girl named Shiley Temple Wong who moves from China to Brooklyn, New York. There she learns all about these new people and this new place. But there was one thing that caught Shirleys eye as soon as she moved to New york and that was BASEBALL."
4,A very interested book to read.,I thought the book was rather interesting. It was easy to read and follow up on. I thought it was a good fifth grade level book. I would recommend this book to anyone.
5,Any kid would love this book that is how good it is !!!!!!!,When I read this book I had to read it for school.I am glad I did ! This story takes place in New York City. Shirley Temple Wong is put in American school where eveything is different. She tryes to understand America but it`s hard because she only know`s chinese way`s.This story about and imergant chinese girl trying to make friends and trying to keep true to her chinese backround. I think people of all ages sould enjoy this book.I rate this book 5 stars.Enjoy!!!!
3,Book that keeps you interested!,"The book is about a girl who goes to New York. She was born in China so she has to make new friends,and get used to the American tradition. So one day she decided to play baseball, after that she loved the game. She started to make new friends after she hit a home run. When she went up to bat everyone would cheer her on and it made her feel like part of the group. When Jackie Robinson was invited to their school she was greatly honored to present him with the key to their school. In the Year of the Boar and Jackie Robinson is a very good book. Even though African-Americans weren't allowed to play in the baseball league, Jackie Robinson made it into the league and hit a bunch of home runs and became one of the leagues favorite players. I would recommend this book for people ages 9 and above."
4,THATS THE STUFF!!!!!,"I recomend this book.I liked the books vocabulary it had so much every time you flipp the page there is a high and intresting vocab word.The book really grasped me it really felt like i was in the book. The last thing I have is the detail and descreption When she said ""She was curled up like a red shrimp""."
3,O.K. book,I had to read this for school. I thought it was funny. Shirley Temple Wong comes from China. She tries to fit in at school. She can not understand a lot of things in Americas customs. This is a good book to read on a rainy day!
4,Quality of product,"I was extremely please with the quality of this book. It was completely intact, with a cover. i just wish shipping didnt exceed the cost of the product."
3,Kid's Review,"Jackie Robinson and the Year of the Boar is an OK book. It shows how life was for an immigrant in the 1940's. It also gives you a taste of how Jackie Robinson felt to cross the racial line.He and Bandit, or Shirley Temple, had something in common. He held his head up high even when there were threats to take his life, and Shirley did the same, while facing the bullying of her school.This book also showed, how even if you're mistreated in the beginning, you can still make friends in the end. Shirley made friends with Mable, while she was getting teased. She was also praised with the following chant:""Hey, Hey you're just great,Jackie Robinson crossed the plate,Hey, Hey you're a dream,Jackie Robinson's on our team.""This book didn't personally intrigue me, but it is perfect for kids who love baseball. Taylor grade 5"
4,"Even though it's an easy read, this book rocks!","This book has a very interesting plot, along with an excellently researched picture of Chinese and American culture in the late 1940s. Although I expected something quite different to happen near the end, I believe that it is quite good if the author decieves you. I, as a ten-year-old (but entering sixth grade, not fifth), was appalled by Marc Simont's depiction of a ten-year old as being about two feet tall. Furthermore, I believe that Lord's writing was quite simple, but that's fine, because not everyone has a high reading level. And that conludes my review."
4,A very interested book to read.,I thought the book was rather interesting. It was easy to read and follow up on. I thought it was a good fifth grade level book. I would recommend this book to any.
4,wonderful,"I think the product is very interesting but goes a little to far in feeling bad for main character Shirley Temple Wong/Bandit. Now the very optimistic things about the story, first off, it teaches children about baseball legend Jackie Robinson in his roll for the famous baseball team the Dodgers, and Shirley's love for baseball in the middle of the story.It also has some moderate violence and starred inappropriate language. Other than that, it is a great novel which involves new wording and language that takes kids reading and vocabulary skills to the next level. The book is 1-170 pages long."
3,"Simple, and entertaining.","I'm an older reader than the level this book was written for but I've just read it recently and I found it very entertaining. I liked the humor in the author's writing. Basically, it's about a young chinese girl who came to America and what her life was like growing up there."
4,The Year of the Boar and Jackie Robinson,"Reading this story I feel as if I am the protagonist, Shirley Temple, of the book. I think the author has done a good job by writing this book such a story as this, especially for children who move from one country to another. Bette Bao Load's style of writing is so vivid. I can picture Shirley. I like the author's style. This story is about Shirley being in a new country, with no friends and she can't speak English properly. Later Shirley is able to make friends. We can learn a lesson from this story of Jackie Robinson. Shirley wanted to make a difference in her life as well as in America. The book is really good and it makes you realized that we are here for a purpose come what may, with strong determination life will be good ."
2,LL---COOL---J,"This book was not the most interesting book i have ever read. I do not think it wnt well with the title. I never did understand how Jackie Robinson had to do with the story. The book was about a girl named Bandit, that lives in China and moves to Broklyn. She faces many problems and is strong enough to overcome these problems. She is asked o play baseball and is put in right field. Now she feels powerful and overcomes her stupitity. She loves the world series team called the Broklyn Dodgers. She sits anxiously in front of the radio."
3,Almost Classic Jerry Reed,"This album has some great classic ""Jerry funny"" style songs but lacks some luster. ""The Bird"" showcases Jerry's talent in impersonating some of the Old Boys of Country and is entertaining enough to enthrall my 6 yr old until the end. (No small feat)Jerry's pickin gets your toe tappin and tempts you to sing along with him.Overall, I am glad that I have this one in my collection being a true Jerry Reed fan."
5,Beautiful & Practical!!,"<br />I just purchased this comforter for my grandson. The comforter is very well represented in the photo's; however, this comforter is even MUCH NICER in person. The size and quality of this comforter make it practical as well. The butterflies wings stand out so baby can touch them..<br />I highly recommend this item!! I may even buy one for my home for my grandson! You will not be disappointed! This comforter would even make a wonderful wall hanging in the nursery. It is a warm, large, and soft comforter, sure to keep baby snug & warm. <br />I would buy this comforter again in a heart beat!<br /><br />"
1,Packing ripped poster!,"Awesome poster, but a piece of tape was stuck to the poster and when I opened it, it ripped! I was very upset because I bought this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend. :("
5,Great poster!,"Trully a great poster! In a black wooden frame it will look even better!Very nice print, item as described.Came pretty fast, also!Recommended!"
5,floyd poster,"perfect! Should have ordered the bigger size, this poster looks better in the door size poster like 36x56 or something."
5,love it,my husband love this one to. it came in really fast. only issues was the Currier left it on the step and my husband stepped on it.
4,A great CD!,"This is ussually not my type of music but I was looking for a way to get in touch with my chakras and so I picked it up. Wow! This is great music. The pounding beat seems to wake up every cell in my body and I feel more alive and more energized. This music seems to tap into something primal, it seems to get into my blood and I just want to dance and feel my connection to my body and the earth. I have never heard a CD like this, it is unique and one of first the CD's I pop in my CD system when I'm feeling down or scared."
4,A MEMORY MAKER,"This album brings back great memories. In the San Francisco Bay Area, on Top 40 Radio it was ""Surfin' Hootenanny"" from June 1963. On the local R&B radio station during that time period ""Jivin' Around"" and ""Cookin'"" were heard. This album brings out Casey's suburb multiple styles in targeting both white and black audiences. ""Guitars Guitars, Guitars"" brought both white and black audiences together when that single was released in May 1963. It was heard on both Top 40 and R&B radio. This guitarist, organist, and producer from Phoenix Arizona came out with a goldmine of great and unique cuts on this album. ""Jivin' Around"" is definitely a thumbs up."
2,Lincoln costume,"Thought it was my lucky day when I found a Lincoln hat and beard available at a relatively reasonable price when my son was given the role of Lincoln in a church production. Was a bit concerned, however, upon their arrival, to find that the beard had just three tiny pieces of two-sided tape on it to attach to the face. The tape came off the beard during the process of pealing off the outside paper to reveal the sticky portion and then would not stick back on the beard backing. I ended up having to sew on a piece of elastic in order to get the beard to stay on. The hat stayed on nicely, but I was thankful no one had to see it up close as the felt material was very wrinkled from being folded up in its packaging. Faced with a similar situation in the future I wouldn't order this type of costume again unless it was about half the cost! It's really not worth $20.00"
4,About free library downloads,"FYI- I purchased an ipod just to be able to do the free audiobook downloads that our library offers - only to discover you need a ""generic"" MP3 player (NOT and iPOD) has to do with the copyright protection - check with your library what MP3 player will work. Also - they are like library books (expired after 2-3 weeks), which might not work so well for language courses."
5,Custer,"The Custer Album was not only fine reading but the book contains loads of photos that take us back in time enabeling the reader to see Custer, his wife, brothers, the 7th Cav and the American Indians that played a major role in the plains wars. Great Book!"
4,"Okay, but prefer the lengthening mascara!","I bought these because my teenage daughters ""borrowed"" the first Palladio mascara I bought at the local Walgreen's. I figured this would keep them out of my things. Only difference is I bought the Water Resistant kind and not the ""lengthening"" mascara. This one is ""okay"" it just does not make my lashes stand out like the lengthening mascara does."
5,Great songwritter = great songs,"Joel Plaskett proforms fantastically on stage and brings that same enthusiasm so his record. Although many peg it as country rock...it must be said THIS IS NOT COUNTRY!!!!! If one listens to his band Thrush, one realizes the rock roots. Fantastic CD."
4,A Strong Performance,"After seeing the Joel Plaskett Emergency live in Kingston Ont. Canada, I had to pick up his new cd. This latest effort by Mr. Plaskett is an extermely strong one showing a wide variety of tunes ranging from ballads to more upbeat tracks which draw out feelings of nostalgia. Song like ""True Patriot Love"" and ""It's Cathching On"" demonstrate his skill in a wide variety of genres. The music can be described as alt. country pop with very strong rock and indy influences. A great cd worth picking up."
2,Not what I was hoping for,"I was hoping for a rich, creamy caramel made without corn syrup as the first ingredient - these are not that. They're a bit gritty, not to mention the use of hydrogenated oil even though they're touted as being made with milk. Being able to view the ingredients list and Nutrition Facts Label would have provided info I needed to alter my purchase. thanks"
1,Beware-not as listed!,"The ingredients listed are nothing like what is actually in the caramel. I would not call these caramels since they have sorbitol and hydrodgenated coconut oil in them and artificial flavors. VERY dissapointed, and Amazon just said oh well when I brought this HUGE misrepresented item to their attention. I now have 4.4lbs of garbage to toss out. People with dietary restrictions should be very wary when buying from Amazon since there is no one checking the acuracy of the item info placed on Amazon, per the email they sent me."
3,its not a tiffen,"It's not a Tiffen, it was a Rokinson y2, I took it to the camera shop, they never heard of the brand, it has no coating either, just glass and yellow, it even seamed a little lighter shade of yellow than other brands, but it works. For the price it's ok. But buyer beware, if you order something and it's not what was on the headline return it, as for me, this one I got is fine for what I do."
2,Great for Corporate Worship. Bad for True Worship,"A Royal Waste of Time is another character sketch on ""how to do"" Worship. Although, highly insightful on Corporate Worship, Dawn misses the mark on true Biblical Worship. She is blur of many authors today who are trying to ""fix"" Worship instead of doing Worship - just another slant on how to create a corporate worship environment."
3,Ed the chameleon,"Ed Ackerson, founder of 27 Various and later Polara, changed sound and styles according to the flavor of the month.Whether it's Midwestern Guitar Jangle, My Bloody Valentine (this LP), or Electronic Downtempo (Polara), Ed strived to be hip with his two bands in the 80s and 90s.You will hear a bit of all these styles on this record.Ed was a staple of the Minneapolis Indie Seen (sic).His production talents are his bell cow."
3,Apples in Stereo?,"Sounds like Apples in Stereo quite often.Nice production and all, but not particularly exciting."
4,15 minute French (Eyewitness Travel),"This product is a good way to brush up your French and give you useful phrases for a visit to the country. Note that this product comes in two different packages. Both include the book but one includes two CD's. If you want the CD's, which help with pronunciation, make sure the package being offered contains them as it is not included in most sales of this item. The French are appreciative of anyone who attempts to speak their language and ones reception is notably enhanced by trying. This is a good way to be able to fulfill that condition."
3,Concise yet useful handbook,"This is a great little handbook. The little motivational tips throughout are things that can easily be done in the workplace on a daily basis with little effort, yet act as motivators for employees. A lot will seem simple and common sense but those little things are sometimes lacking in the work environment."
1,not ready for prime time,"It's difficult for me to believe that at least one of the other band members couldn't sing ""Cheerio"", for example, better than Ian Anderson does here. But if, for one reason or another, this is not an option, then, it seems to me, three remain: The band might (belatedly) 1) hire a singer, 2) go instrumental, or 3) hang it up.I vote for 2) with the caveat that this should be not be construed to be a license to indulge in the interminable jigs and reels Mr. Anderson has favored since 1974 or so (represented here by the middle section of ""In the Grip""--an arrangement different from that found on the Dances album)."
4,"Great production, sound","Tull's first live album in ten years is an excellent mix of old and newer material. The production quality is simply amazing and Ian's voice is just fine, thank you. Cheers for not simply taking songs from the forthcoming DVD...."
4,Cuts perfect hinge mortises,"I've used this product for about a year now from hanging single doors slabs which only require a hinge mortise (replacement doors) to hanging door slabs in new openings which require hinge mortise's on the door and jamb. It's worked very well and the results have been perfect. The doors have fit exactly in the openings and for replacement doors (trying to match new hinge location on the door with old hinge location on the jamb) the hinges have always lined up. The hinges fit perfectly in the mortise and have that quality, factory installed look to them. The reason I didn't give it five stars is that the depth of the hinge always seems too shallow when mortising for replacement doors. This is overcome by using one of the extra metal flanges as a spacer when aligning the template. Then it work's great. A good tool to use when you have one or a few doors to hang, a great tool if you have more than a few. Speeds up installation time considerably."
2,Hard to keep set,"This template kit is roughly made. Not easy to keep set up for any length of time (screws loosen). Can be a knuckle scraper. Problem setting the center template the same for the flip flop on the jamb.I would expect a tool of this type would be made of extruded Aluminum for better accuracy of measurment. I would pay more for such a tool. The price equals the quality on this one.I have been a carpenter for 35 years, hinged a lot of doors in that time. Pre-hung doors are the choice of course, but sometimes you have to do them on site. This tool wouldn't be my first choice."
3,5/8 hinge bit needed,"Well, it seems to me that a 5/8 hinge bit should be part of the kit. Secondly the template guide works well with a porter cable routers not so well will other routers and their guides. I damaged the hinge template when I used a Bosch router. AFter purchasing the porter cable router, all was fine."
4,With the exception of....,"My only gripe with this otherwise excellent template is the availability of the various sized jamb gauges that are necessary to transfer hinge locations from already prepared jamb to door, or vice-versa. I would think they would be included with the tool, but instead I've been having to literally hunt them down. The 4"" gauge is not even available, that I can find. In fact, if anyone has a set (3) of the 4"" gauge, let me know!Otherwise, the Hinge Butt Template Kit is an excellent tool to have for anyone involved in the task of reto-fitting and hanging new doors. It has proved to be extremely useful to me."
3,Minor disappointment,"This final book in the series was a bit of a disappointment. The story itself is good - poor, struggling rodeo girl meets wealthy European aristocrat and landowner - but the book didn't quite meet the level of quality I found in the first two stories. The use of American slang was stilted at times, almost as if it had been thrown in as an afterthought. Leo seemed much more American than Italian, and the resolution to the central conflict seemed quite abrupt. Not what I'd come to expect from Ms. Gordon's stories."
2,Disappointing,"Based on the title, I thought there would be footage of a gunner attacking targets in actual combat. However, the video is nothing more than a couple of nice old vets sitting around and reminiscing about some old WWII photos."
4,This is a big film about a big turtle.,Gamera is woken up by an atomic blast. He spins to Tokyo and causes destruction. Interesting film with subtitles and has great special effects. First of a long series of silly Gamera movies.
2,Unidentified Flying Turtle,"Out of all of the Japanese giant monsters that inevitably sprung up after Godzilla's massive popularity, one of the more fondly remembered is Gamera. Gamera, a giant flying turtle, really didn't star in any good movies until the mid nineties, but the late sixties-earlier seventies films were fun in a sort of goofy way. This first one, ""Gammera [sic] the Invincible,"" is perhaps the dullest and most slow moving one, but hard-core Japanese monster fans will no-doubt find pleasure in it. In addition, this DVD features the not-very-good American version, with inserted American scenes (some of these are pretty funny in their sheer technical incompetence).This DVD, from Alpha, isn't really worth buying. The print is very scratchy and faded, and is in the pan-and-scan 1.33:1 instead of the intended 2.35:1 ratio. The only plus side is a mildly diverting gallery of publicity stills and posters."
1,Pure Cheese,"This film about a flying turtle and the children who befriend it is beyond ludicrous, worse, it's incredibly boring. Even the cheesy special effects can't salvage this waste of celluloid."
4,Showa Gamera's First Respectful DVD Release,"Shout! Factory's first Gamera DVD release (overlooking their Elvira's Movie Macabre edition of Gamera, Super Monster) finally gives the monster the respect he deserves. The video and audio quality are fantastic. Extras include a booklet, original Japanese trailer (with subtitles), a Gamera series retrospective featurette (with not 100% accurate subtitles, but subbed nonetheless), publicity image gallery, and an informative audio commentary by kaiju authority August Ragone. The DVD lacks the original US version Gammera the Invincible, or the Sandy Frank-released dub from the 80s. Despite these shortcomings, this DVD should belong in every kaiju fan's collection."
3,Bad Transfer,"This is about the DVD pictured here (Gammera the Invincible), not the updated 2010 widescreen version (Gamera the Giant Monster). This full screen version is a pale scratchy copy of a good movie. I am upgrading to the widescreen version. (Same movie, different titles. I know, it's confusing.)"
3,Mmmmmmmmmmmm...........,"Well, This movie is cheesy and the fx are laughable, but it was made in 1965, and that says it all. I feel that the original Godzilla movie was, in comparison, a more professional production than this one in the fx department as well as overall structure.Anyway this is the one that started it all, and that is the way this movie should be looked at. Overall: FAIR (considering.....)."
2,"Dangerous, giant Turtle. A-a-a-r-r-r-r-g-g-g-g-h-h-h-h","Although the acting is rather stilted, the cast portarys a believable horror at the devastation and destruction caused by a formidable monster indeed - Gammera. Otherwise, a real 'napper.'"
3,Gammera the Invincible,Watching this movie is a trip back to my youth. I used to watch these monster movies late at night on the local TV stations. It is sooooo corny that it is good. If a person did not grow up watching these movies they may not like them. But for those of us in the know they are just plain fun to watch. It is nice to see it on DVD.
3,fasnitating but to long to keep your intrest,this movie was fasinating and it was intertaing to adults and kids but alot of space was wasted and interest dissovled into the empty spaces and periods of exsive talking.
4,FUNKY FUNKY FUNKY,"WOW, THERE ARE SOME GREAT FUNK SONGS HERE FROM THE KING LABEL, ALL RECORDED BETWEEN 1968-1974, WHEN FUNK RULED!!! BILL DOGGETT TURNS IT UP A NOTCH (WITH A FUNK BEAT THAT HE GOT FROM JAMES BROWN, WHO HE WAS OPENING UP FOR IN CONCERT, AFTER JAMES USED TO OPEN UP FOR HIM THE 50'S, AS WELL AS HANK BALLARD), THERE IS A GREAT VERSION OF TIGHTEN UP BY SOMEONE NAMED ROOSEVELT MATTHEWS, THE COASTERS (!) DO A FUNKY VERSION OF LOVE POTION NUMBER NINE AND WAIT TILL YOU HEAR ABOUT ""THE WITCH DOCTOR"", BY OVER NIGHT LOW!"
4,Finger Poppin Good,"24 funk tracks culled from the vaults of King records from the years 1969-73. No James Brown here but his influence is felt on many of the tracks, and the liner notes explain that the Sons of Funk are the JB's. R&B pioner Hank Ballard takes a walk on the funky side with Butter your popcorn and Unwind yourself. What I like about this CD is that it's not the same old songs that radio bleached the enjoyment out of. Many new names, good liner notes, this CD is Funky, Funky."
4,"Great Tracks, bizarre cuts","I read the reviews before i bought this. I am really glad that I bought it because the tracks are incredible. Some of these tracks are predecessors to tracks that I'm more familiar with. Tighten Up is one that comes to mind immediately. It's interesting to hear where Archie Bell and the Drells got the ideas for their version of Tighten Up. Also, the funkier Love potion no. 9 on this disc is one not to be missed.The only complaint i have is that the cuts are very bizarre. They fade out before the song finishes on most of the tracks. It can get pretty annoying when all you want to hear is a climax to the guitarists solo.It's not such a big deal since the disc is so solid. You'll be able to go back into these tracks over and over again."
2,The land of Elton,It was a good book I am going to rate this book for a reason I think this is the best book I have ever read so don't put this book down give a book a chance
2,Disappointing.,"After reading the first two books, I had high expectations for the final book in this trilogy. And the third book wasn't bad, until I got to the part where Carman tries to convert his readers to Christianity using a not-so-subtle allegory that he ""sneaks"" into the story. Then Elyon/God spends the rest of the book leading Alexa by the nose to each and every place she needs to be, while her friends conveniently show up at the last second to rescue her every time she's in trouble.If Carman would have left out the religion and tried to follow at least some of the rules of believable plotting, this book might have been an okay read. As it is now, though, I wouldn't recommend it."
3,So so,"I read all three Land Of Elyon books in the span of a few weeks. I thought it was okay, nothing special."
1,Unreliable,"Don't waste your time on this junk. Mine blew up just out of warranty with a tape loading problem. Repairing is almost as expensive as purchasing a new model.I've checked other JVC problems on the net; broken CCDs, reset problems, etc. Stay away from JVC; I wish I did.By the way, JVC is terrible in low light compared to my 10 year old Sony 8mm."
2,Poor compatiblity,"One of reason that I purchased this camcorder was to transfer the wedding video taken by a friend using a Sony Camcorder.Surprsingly, this JVC model cannot even play back the tape properly. The two replacement units Amazon sent to us do not work either!To verify the tape itself, I tried one Canon and one Panasonic camcorder at local BestBuy. It can be played flawlessly."
4,Some terrific re-imaginings of classic songs,"The last recording from a great power pop band. This collection of covers affirms the creative range of a band that was known for its wily originals. Check out a distorted ""Time of the Season"", and their stunning interpretations of ""Helpless"" and Big Star's ""Ballad of El Goodo""."
4,Success is yours...read how,This book was an excellent and quick read. Well written by all contributing and nuggets throughout the book. I found many things to implement in my own road to success as an artist. I highly recommend this book to artists and anyone in business whether for yourself or others. There are some great takeaways for those in the corporate world as well. Put in the time and see what happens.
1,Uniformly Bland,"A uniformly bland book. The author says in 11 chapters what could easily be said in a couple of paragraphs. And then, in the final chapter, he completely loses it and embarks on some sort of ridiculous diatribe against AI research. He displays an amazing degree of animosity towards those involved in this field of research, some of which he names personally. There are many far better books on usability available from Amazon.com, forget this one. What can I say, Leonardo would dismiss him as a fool."
1,Biased revisionist nonsense,"Mr. Bird does not like much of anything that the American government has done since 1945. He goes out of his way in this book to drag in a lot of Cold War issues that are only peripherally relevant to the Bundy brothers -- including a long and rather tedious digression on how one of them edited a book on the decision to bomb Hiroshima that the author, having written his own book on the subject, disagrees with. The fact that the author does not like the tough decisions made by various Cold Warriors does not excuse the one-sided, highly partisan and biased nature of this book. Its credibility is not enhanced by such elementary mistakes such as thinking that First Lieutenant is a lower rank than Second Lieutenant, or identifying someone as a lieutenant in a photo caption when his captain's bars are clearly visible on his uniform. Pass on this one and you will not regret it."
4,Ford Wins!,Great book...glad to see it enlarged and expanded. Do yourself a favor and pic up a copy- ignore @#$%^ reviewers...........
3,The right texts but the wrong presentation.,"By attempting to reintroduce The Hoff to a new generation, this book certainly attempted the honourable. However, one of the most important elements of the original trio of books that make up the bulk of the text of this volume (REVOLUTION FOR THE HELL OF IT, WOODSTOCK NATION and STEAL THIS BOOK) was the brilliant artwork, punctuating the texts, that was not even mentioned in this one. If you can't find the original three, this will be a passable introduction to Hoffman's brilliance, but be forewarned that you're missing out on a unique experience."
4,"Nice book, high price",The book is in good quality. The content is comprehensive. I bought it cause it's a required textbook for my graduate course. Too expensive I think.
5,Engaging and delightful read!,"What fun! I began at Florida Southern College in 1998, and during my years there I heard stories, sure, but nothing like this! Dr. Bruce takes us through decades of folk tales about the college, you know--those ghost stories and such that we all loved telling over and over again. I never knew there were so many--it makes for a great read! He also makes you think about why the stories get told--what's going on with the tellers. I finished it in one long (kind of spooky) night! I never had Dr. Bruce for a class--boy, I wish I had!"
5,WOW! SO TRUE,"I go to florida southern and as i read through the stories i couldn't believe it because the same stuff has happened to me and my friends. From the scraching on the walls to the Girl with the long blonde hair. It's amazing, you have to experience the presence of them on this campus and the book describes them perfectly"
2,not what I expected,I was a little disapointed in the toy cell phones - it was a lot bulkier than expected and the actual numbers don't press - it is just one big button. I bought two for my twin girls and they played with them for a little while but got bored with them quickly because it didn't have individual numbers and was really big - they would rather play will mine instead.
2,Not worth the money,I bought this phone for my grandaughter and when I received it. The batteries were dead.I had to replace the batteries before I gave it to her. The game is ok and just not worth the money.She doesn't play it much. You can purchase other toy phones that are much better and less expensive.
4,PUNK/METAL,"Excellent record from this british band,consisting of (arranged on the cd in chronological order) theTo The Ends Of The Earth 4 tracker 12ep,an epic crossover marvel,and the Forward Into Battle lp,a totally thrash/epic metal album.The performance is impecable,especially the lead guitar player's,Gizz Butt,of later PRODIGY fame,with Jon Mackay providing a solid rhythm guitar,unfortunately somewhat buried in the mix.The rhythm section is nothing short of a leveller,although the bass drums are a little muddled.The singing (Adie) is reminiscent of a hoarser Paul Balluf (EXODUS) although some metal purists might complain about his lack of vocal range (hey,he started in a punk band,remember ? ) The general sound,on the other hand,is very uneven in the tonal,volume and dinamics departments,requiring heavy signal processing to deliver its full power.This is a real scorcher guaranted to peel off the paint from your ceiling."
5,what can i say,Great Item great seller great cd. I would recomend this to anyone that likes old punkrock music. Forward into battle one of the best albums ever
4,Surprisingly Good.,"I am a fan of Billy's. Not a rabid fan, but a fan all the same. I didn't get my hopes up too high for this release, but for nostalgic reasons, I picked this up. I have to say this is a really strong release. Much better than most of the stuff I hear today and I think stronger than many of Billy's past releases. I however was one of the few people that didn't hate CyberPunk. So you may not trust me.I happen to enjoy all but 1 track on the entire cd. I have listened to it 5 times now and it's actually getting better.One comment, is it me or does the song Cherie sound like Billy channeling Neil Diamond. I just love it. Anyway the album kicks off with 2 really strong rockers. Both are very hooky. There is quite a mix of styles on here but all in all, it's just good old fashioned pop-rock done Billy Idol's way.If you like Billy Idol then just make the jump. It's worth it."
5,Kicks Tail,"This is one of my favorite disks of the past two years. It was so refreshing to hear Billy sound so strong, and have very creative and introspective things to say. Personal favorites are ""Devil's Playground"" and ""Plastic Jesus""."
4,round and round we go in super overdrive,"For all that thought that Billy Idol's comeback with his first studio album in over 10yrs would fail, (including myself) I think that Idol has proven that he can still kick a little ass! Even though this CD doesn't match up to the greatness of his CD's he did in the 1980's, he should get an A for effort alone. Idol stays pretty close to his punkrock genere, yet at times the CD takes a turn for the worse with some cheesy ballads and some really crappy songs. Still though, this is a solid effort, and I believe that Idol was the first musican to take Punk rock and turn it into Pop music. Yes there was the Clash and Sex Pistols, but Idol really got himself on the map with GEN X's (his first band) Dancing with Myself. So if you wanna hear some real punkrock from the Grandaddy, listen to this and ditch your Green Day and My Chemical Romance CD's"
2,"Have enjoyed artistry, but not fan on this album","I like Billy and his music, this album did not hit me like I had hoped...strong rocking sound, but did not connect for me to feel the message and energy."
3,Billy's Back ! ! ! ! !,Billy Idol is back after a little break kinda.He has some new meterial and a different sound. But he does team up with SteveStevens again. It's a little bit different of sound than before. But Then anything hasgot to be better than Cyberpunk. Some people say he should just have walked away.Billy's not about giving up in any form. He is no stranger to contraversy On thisCD He manages to reinvent himself. Take a listen and tell us what you think
4,Old School and better than ever.,"I always enjoyed Billy Idol's music, but was never a big fan. I never actually owned a Billy Idol cd or cassette back in the early 80's when he made his splash. From the first note of Devil's Playground, I knew this was one that I had to own. If you like real rock and roll from the 70's and 80's you will love this collection. Solid rock and riffs and hooks from start to finish. Run, don't walk to get this one fast."
3,Gotta give the guy props,"Even if this isn't your style of music (it isn't mine) you gotta give the guy one thing: he pulled one risky stunt, coming back like this, and whether I like it or not, I gotta give him a nod for effort."
4,Welcome back Billy and Steve,"I have to agree with the other reviewers of this album. It IS good!! I was pleasantly suprised to hear Billy and Steve back in top form. Scream was the only choice for the single, but it's arguable in my mind as to whether or not it's the best song on the CD. Rat Race, Body Snatcher and Evil Eye are all kick a** songs !! Check these guys out on tour if you get the chance, great show."
5,Father of Punk Rock Still Got da Beat,"Just recently I got to see Billy Idol in concert. WOW!!!! After all these years he still looks great, sounds great, and gives his all in concert as well as the recording studio. This album is vintage Idol, with the Christmas song a real suprise. My fav is ""Scream"" is so very Idol. What I would like to point out here is that his longtime guitarist, Steve Stevens, is an awesome player. He is very underappriciated and has real talent. He really rocks in person. This is a great album, with a more sedate Idol. Thats OK, he's grown up, so have we. Rock on Billy...your my Idol."
1,Just didn't do it for me,"First off, I'd like to say kudos to Billy Idol for trying... and I'm sure a lot of people enjoyed this album, I'm just not one of them. I wasn't around for most of the 80s, but a friend got me listening to him couple years ago. I loved his music (and still do) and saw him in concert last summer. However, though I agree that people and their music do evolve, I just thought that Devil's Playground was a little too flat and Good Charlotte-ish. These were the songs during the concert where everyone sat down. I would say to listen to Devil's Playground online or borrow it from a friend before spending the money. I think it's one of those love it or hate it albums."
1,Ole Billy is not up to standard,"Not to me, he isn't. I got the mp3 version of this album before deciding whether I should spend the money on it or not, and I'm glad I did, otherwise it would've been 10 bucks chucked out the window. For quite a few songs I couldn't believe I was listening to Billy, they sound like those rubish wannabe rock groups back in the 80's. I promise you, if it weren't Billy's name on the cd, this record would have only sold accidentally. And I forgot to mention I'm a Billy Idol fan, got all his previous albums, including Generation X's. I really love his old work, but this one is just disapointing. The man is going to perform live in my city promoting this album on his first visit in my country, and I can't be bothered to go there. Had he come before this release, ahhh, that would've been a different story, I would've been first in line to get a ticket. I'm sorry, but unless you are a die hard fan that just HAS to have all his album, I suggest you skip this one."
1,Let down again..........,"As is typically the case with all Billy Idol records we get one kick-ass cut and the rest are filler to justify putting out an entire CD. I am a huge Billy Idol fan and wish that for once he would quit making music that sells and just kick ass like we know he can. Scream is one of those blood-pumping, spine tingling, hair standing up on the back of your neck kind of cuts, but there's little left for us to enjoy afterwards. Does anyone remember, ""Beautiful Star"" from his Self-titled release? That's what most of these songs remind me of. Who produces this crap? What else is there to say?"
5,"A mixed bag, perhaps, but no clunkers...","This book might have a mixed bag of stories, but there's no real clunkers in it: I disagree with the previous reviewer... most of the stories are at the very least ""good"", and I would recommend this and its companion ""True Names and Other Dangers"" to any Vinge fan. The ""singularity"" is also a background element in more of the stories than is immediately obvious.One other thing to keep in mind, as you read ""The Blabber"" - Vinge has said it's not intended as a sequel to ""A Fire Upon the Deep"", the names of the characters notwithstanding."
1,Made in INDIA not in the USA as description says!,"Be careful. This product is Made in India not in the USA as the description says few times. The leather is certainly not even closer to the ""finest quality U.S. hides"". The product does not even look closer to the picture. The item pictured is the old one that was US made, but what you will get is a copy made in India that is not even closer to the original. At $89 this item is very high priced. Amazon please correct the description and remove any USA reference from it."
2,Nice to bad can't were it,Beautiful ..... but no use. Faulty design. Can not keep them on my feet.The back of the shoe is short and wide. Nothing seems to work gel pads exc...
4,Dark Victory Scarecrow Figure,"The figure is awesome to display, although it's hard for him to stand on his own even with the base! However, that is the only problem. Otherwise, he is top notch. He comes with a solid plastic doll from the story which was a nice addition! Articulation is good, but if you try to pose him do so carefully; he's scrawny!. Detail and paint are uncanny and is exactly like that of the story. I love the sculp of the figure, especially his hat. If you don't mind standing him up against something then get it! Retail is about $15 which is a major steal with this figure! I recommend this to any Scarecrow fan!"
2,Williams/Hartnett Big Bang Agenda,"I bought this book believing it to be a critique of the Big Bang model, done with scientific rigour. The book is useful in presenting and reviewing work by others (notably H. Arp) that seriously questions the Big Bang (and by extension, current cosmological wisdom).However, the authors' sole purpose - agenda - was to promote a religious paradigm with primary reference to the Big Bang theory.There is no effort to review work being done by scholars on alternative models to the current gravity-based cosmology.For those who wish to persue scholarly discussion, I would not recommend this book."
5,Big Bang Boggles,"This book clarifies the real issues with the big bang. Really it is all about ones starting assumptions and this book helps the reader to see what we really know and what we don't know. Clearly the big bang cannot be thought of as a proven fact, far from it. It seems that as the big bang model has 'evolved' so have the problems with it accumulated. A model that cannot describe much more than an expanding cloud of dust and gas hardly describes the universe we live in. This book was written for the lay Christian, contains no equations, and does an absolutley excellent job of explaining the big bang in lay terms. It shows that it is absolutely imcompatible with the biblical description of our origins. Therefore Christains cannot use the big bang as some method by which God created the universe. Instead taking the biblical description at face value is a far better approach to describing the world and the cosmos we see."
1,MORE ALPHA GARBAGE,"Ignore the Alpha Video shill. This is yet more unremastered, unwatchable garbage from the most vile company to ever distribute film."
3,And the rest is history?,"My daughters love this book. My husbands family is from Calabria and they are entranced by the pictures and the langauge he uses - but what does it mean when he says at the end ""And the rest is history""?My husband has no idea - and I am clueless - and the girls want to know what happens next. I would have liked some sort of summary at the end that brings parents up to speed with the history behind the story."
3,Not so good,I read this study guide twice before taking the exam. I was fairly confident that I had the material in it down cold. I was totally unprepared for the real exam and I didn't make it. I've been working with Win2k for about 6 months now and still got surprised at the exam format and difficulty. Don't depend solely on this book for exam readiness. You probably won't make it.
2,Questionable,"Upon completion of this book, I would not recommend it - unless you have a thorough grasp of the subject and do not mind errors/discrepancies. Numerous attempts to contact editors proved futile although a contributing editor provided some help. Contacting publisher to register book and obtain updates and listing of errors placed me in perpetual hold.If you do not mind misprints and getting updates/seeing listing of errors is not important to you, this may be worthwhile. If not, search elsewhere."
2,Just OK,"I used this book and my experience to pass the test. It was hands on knowledge, not this book, that allowed me to pass. The material coverage is adequate, but a little thin in some areas (SNA, Proxy). The self test questions are ok, but I found several incorrect answers. Note: I did not review the publishers web site for updates/corrections. If you purchase this book, I recommend also using a second source."
1,Love it when Co-Author's review their own books...,"I don't appreciate it when the co-author of the book reviews his own book. If I wrote a book, I would think it was the greatest thing too."
3,2 buy OR not 2 buy,"Ok!Digital Blue is a good toy for the directer in your child and it is a good experience,Personaly I like making movies but a Camcorder limits the use of making a hit. Bad side U use it for 2-5 minutes then run to your computer to process it and run back to finish what you started.Then you have to have the right kind of computer for it to work. So if you buy it and it doesn't work, YOU JUST WASTED 100$. Thanks for listening to my opinon, BYE"
1,bad idea,it was very hard to work also it breaks easy and you get like only 2 minutes 2 recordcord things and the special features are terrible and special effects are just messed up.
4,2 buy OR not 2 buy,"Ok!Digital Blue is a good toy for the directer in your child and it is a good experience,Personaly I like making movies but a Camcorder limits the use of making a hit.

5,Digital Blue Digital Movie Creator,"It's so cool, if you always wanted to be a director,or be a star ,you could .With the Digital Blue Digital Movie Creater . You just record ,and lights,carama and action. When you are done you could put in your p.c and make speacial effects!!!!!!"
4,Incredible!,"The digital blue is awesome! Now for pros and cons.pros= special effects,low price,take it anywhere.cons=blurry images {but good enough images},and takes up 300 memory space on your computer."
5,Great first vidoe camera,"My daughter (9) received one of these, and she's crazy about it. Don't expect zooms or a LCD viewfinder. BUT, the camera is adequate and actually good for the price, and it comes with a USB interface, so it's plug-and-play. What's really great about this camera is the software that comes with it. With no previous exposure to editing software at all, within a few hours Elizabeth was producing great video presentations complete with wipes, fades, voice-overs, special effects, backgroud music, and really, it was fun watching her show.I wish my pro-editing software was a easy to use as hers (perhaps I'll steal it)."
4,1 Year later - Interest has grown small,"It was a big hit last x-mas, but now it is collecting dust. After a few movies, the kids have grown bored. There is only so much one can do with the special effects. I was hoping that there would be software that can be used to jazz up the movie."
1,JUNK!!!!!!!!,Camera won't even turn on!!!! playing with the stock image effectswas fun for 2 min for my 5 and 8 year olds
3,"An Excellent Camera, But the capability is horrible.",I purchased this camera about two years ago for my son and he loved it right away. About a couple of months later the trigger to film its spring broke and my son couldn't film. We had to buy another one and now that its on his computer it mutes whenever hooked up to the computer whenever he films. This camera has great special effects but the durability of it is useless. This camera is a great gift but don't expect to much capability out of it.
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this for my 9 yr old son and 12 year old daughter. What a total waste of money. Not only is the image quality poor, but the associated editing program is designed for preschoolers. I installed the software on a new Dell P4 desktop with 1GB RAM, so I can eliminate the PC as a suspected source of misery.I finally gave in and let them use my digital camcorder. I cannot believe the junk they make these days."
5,I want one!!!!,"I cant tell you any of the info above beacuse i havent got one yet I went to the toys r us kids world, 3 other toys r uses and they didnt have one i went on line they didnt have one so theyre going to email be when it comes but ive been waiting for a long time. im 11 to let u no.ps the info above may be wrong ill keep writing review if you want to talk sn is lildevil91291 @Aol.com"
5,Always wanted it,"I don't have it yet, but 2 years ago, when I saw the first commercial I had ever seen for it, I fell in love with it right away! This toy is great!"
2,not that good,"I got this thinking I would get a good digital camera, but the quality is low and only half of the features work very well. The battery legnth is only about 2 hours of filming. And the waystation is very unresponsive.The software is nothing you couldn't get for free online. My recominidation would be to go and buy a webcam instead."
1,It needs a lot of space,"I spent a years worth of allowance on this, and was totally disapointed. The software took up half the space o my computer. The pictures wouldn't load, or when they did, they took hours (literally). My computer part was faulty, and wouldn't let me do certain things. I think it might of been just the one I got, but...I don't know. The bottom line is: DON""T BUY IT IF YOUR COMPUTER DOESN""T HAVE A LOT OF SPACE!!!! I eventually had to uninstall it because the rest of my computer wasn't functioning either."
1,Broke rather easily,"Hello,The BP cuff worked for a bit... First the stiching that held the Guauge on became unravled. And then the Valve on the bulb snapped off, when I was closing the valve. I ended up buying another one locally for 4 dollars more... and it was of much better quality.Sorry, But i would not recomend this... but maybe i got a fluke._trv"
4,"great for students, good communication w/ company.","At first I misunderstood, and thought that this kit came with a stethoscope. It does not, just for the record. But then I got an email from the company and through email we were able to come to an understanding and work things out. Now I'm happy, if not just for the attention to my negative feedback, they are obviously on top of their products and their customers satisfaction. As for quality, this will get me through school, and that's what matters. And shipping was speedy, thanks!"
4,very impressive debut album,"olympia's bangs impress on their debut album, tiger beat. a melting pot of ac/dc, bangles, and maybe black sabbath if they weren't so dark and angry sounding. this album is intoxicatingly catchy, while rocking at the same time. with guitar solos that seem to go to outer space but come back at the right time. the nice thing about this album is that it is the perfect length. it ends leaving you wanting more, but knowing that if there were more songs at the end of the album you would be tired from rocking out to long. their new album sweet revenge is pretty good too."
1,Sounds like...everything else...,"We wanna be just like yew. To lame to create their own sound The Bangs are content with medocrity and the status quo. Don't waste your time, there are plenty of other Oly bands who are much more worthy than this second rate schlock. The only thing good about this band is their drummer Jesse Fox."
2,You get what you pay for,I purchaced this product because I needed a hinge template asap and this is the one that I could find that could ship the earliest. Although it did get the job done (on site hanging of eleven doors) it didn't make the job very easy. I had to be very careful when I was adjusting the distance guide for setting the top hinge because when I tighten the holding screw it would move the spacing bar causing the door and the jamb hinge pockets not to line up as they should and the back of the jig was not made heavy enough so the back of the hinge pocket had a curve to it. Also the hinges fit sloppy in the finished pocket. I am glad that they provided more nails than needed to secure the jig to the door as the kept bending when the jig was removed from the door. As I stated earlier it did get the job but I should have waited for a better one to come available and it does reinforce my belief that you get what you pay for.
2,Don't expect much,"I agree with the previous reviewer that you get what you pay for. This applies to the customer service as well. Call long distance, request accessories (the router bit is not provided), and never receive them. This is what you should expect. if you do decide to go the low cost route, make sure your router is equipped with a template following set of guides, specifically 1/2 ID x 5/8 OD and that you have the 1/2 dia mortising bit handy as you will not have much luck acquiring them from Carey Template. Call Mike he'll help (not!). Anyway, if you don't have the template guide or the mortising bit you can obtain them for about $25 total from MLCSwoodworking.com"
5,Murder on Old Mission,"Murder on Old Mission. Loved it! We live near to Old Mission, and this book was great. We thank you."
2,"The Revolution: Who I Slept With, Almost Slept With & What I Wore....","I chose this book for a writing project in a college Women's Literature class almost 10 years ago, and have been unable to forget how shallow and useless I found it to be. The entire story has the air of an adolescent girl who is experimenting with autonomy. I kept waiting for the author to reveal some sort of epiphany or demonstrate some growth in the depth of her character, but that moment never arrives. I would have given a one star reveiw, but I want to acknowledge that I was reading an English Version, so perhaps there were some cultural nuances that were lost in translation.On a side note, the other book I read for the project was Edwidge Danticat's, Farming of Bones, which I loved (sad, but excellent)."
2,"Very well-written book, can't say much about its substance.","A woman's ""diary"" about how she came to risk her life and family for her own Sandinista ""ideals"" and sexual/feminist liberation. Great summary of Nicaragua's history. She came out to seem to be a selfish romantic and not the smart woman I thought she would be."
2,A SELF INDULGENT MEMOIR,"A long self indulgent memoir by a woman whose life was focused on her own ""ideals"" and ego needs. Like many memoirs I distrust her memory for all the many events and conversations that make up this book. She sacrifices her children; she glorifies her sexuality; she is the center of her universe. A totally corrupt human being, justifying her lack of moral compass with her professed love of "" liberty and freedom "". PSHAW!"
5,Awe Inspiring!!,"Gioconda Belli's most recent book may be the best memoir I have ever read. It is the beautiful and inspiring story of an amazing woman - a woman who dared to defy what convention expected of her -- in order to help topple a murderous dictator. It is also the gripping story of a historical decade in Central America and in the world, told from a distinctly female point of view. And last but not least, it is the awesome story of a life that has been anything but self-indulgent, one that speaks (in Ms. Belli's words) ""of the joy that comes from surrendering the ""I"" and embracing the ""we."" This book reads like an epic poem: it is filled with love and war, passions and dreams, the personal and the political. This is a truly awe-inspiring memoir, and I highly recommend it."
2,Stick to the facts Mr Moore,"A disappointing follow-up to The French Connection in that Mr Moore attempts his hand at fictionalizing a true story, the true follow-up to what happened to the French Connection dope, and ends up making a dog's breakfast of it all. I assume, due to the times this was written, it was mandatory to have sex scenes which come off (no pun intended) here as badly framed, unbelievable and just plain gross. It's like having your grandpa tell you a dirty joke. I wanted to like this, but just did not."
4,Still waiting!,"I'm sure the product is excellent, however after ordering it nearly 6 weeks ago ....I'm still waiting for it to be shipped!If its advertised on the site one should get the product sooner than that!"
2,poor casting.,"the actor portraying marilyn did not even resemble the role! (she couldn't act it either) ... even still, it was mildly entertaining."
1,i dont know why people like this movie,"This movie was awful, completely inaccurate they made it seem like she was just some crazy person who slept her way to the top. Nowonder people think so badly about Marilyn Monroe. I'm sorry but you do not become a pop culture icon by being stupid. And that's what they made it seem like.According to this movie she only made three movies was high all of the time, was always horny and was illiterate.In the movie they even said ""I will get to the top even if i have to sleep with every man in hollywood""But really you have to think about it though, they do this to every great artist. so I suppose that's why they did it here. They did it to Michael Jackson in man in the mirror, and Mozart and Beethoven they make it seem like they have no talent and accendently became pop culture figures.so, to sum it all up. YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE AS DUMB AS MARILYN MONROE WAS PORTRAYED TO LIKE THIS MOVIE...AND BELIVE IT."
1,Norma Jean & Marilyn,I still have not recieved my DVD. Please send it to me so I can review.Thanks Lisa Van Gieson
1,mary girl,I believe that when a company such as HBO gets their hands on a true story that the story itself becomes a entertainment fairytale. They take it out of context to attract viewers. For example the nudity in the film that was unnecessary (i agree with that comment that was posted earlier) and the way they potrayed her as being this hated and used person by the people she worked with.Don't get me wrong nobody is perfect but it made her look like a victim and she was to good to be portrayed in that sad way. Obviously she was loved otherwise she wouldn't have gone as far as she did. I wonder what her loved ones would think of this movie? Personally i hope normy/mary is a happy spirit wherever she is visiting =}
1,awful!,"I like Marilyn Monroe and this movie is a disgrace...Didnt they even read any books on her? The ending wasnt even correct..She died in bed,not in the ambulance...None if it made sense...They made Marilyn look absolutely stupid and dumb....She was more then that...."
1,BAD BIO : Ashley is GREAT / Mira SUCKS,"As a great fan of Marilyn Monroe's I can tell that this biography is bad. The only good thing in the movie is Ashley Judd's performance, she is great and really gets into her character but...Mira Sorvino is just the worst Marilyn they could find : she is not pretty , her accent sounds phony and she just looks ridiculous . And on top of that , Marilyn was far from being the marilyn you can see in this movie, even though she needed to be loved she was not dumb and was really a good actress : this movie doesn't stick to reality, skips main passages of MM's life... anyway Mira and the biography itself are terrible but Ashley's great....don't watch this if you're a MM fan !!!"
5,Excellent film!,"This movie is a great portrayal of Marilyn Monroe's life. When I watched it on HBO in '96, it made me more interested in her life. I wound up starting a collection of Marilyn's movies. She was bipolar (which has been declared a fact recently), and this movie is interesting as well as fact-based (although no movie is completely factual). I LOVE IT! Mira Sorvino and Ashley Judd absolutely shine! They are awesome actresses!"
2,STARS FOR ASHLEY JUDD ONLY,"ONCE AGAIN A FILM THAT COULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT BIOGRAPHY IS RUINED. THIS MOVIE MAKES MARILYN MONROE LOOK NUTS IN EVERY WAY,AND SHE WAS NOT. IF THE WRITERS HAD STUCK TO THE FACTS I THINK THE MOVIE COULD HAVE BEEN GOOD. ASHLEY JUDD SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE ONLY PERSON PLAYING MARILYN, SHE WAS SO MUCH BETTER THAT MIRA SORVINO. THE ONLY THING MIRA COMES CLOSE TO CAPTURING ABOUT MARILYN IS HER HAIR COLOR."
2,"Entertaining to a point, but totally inaccurate.","The HBO movie is entertaining to a point. I just couldn't get through the inaccuracies. I found this movie referenced under documentary of Marilyn Monroe's life, but it is not a documentary of her life. This is just a movie with some good acting, and a lot of false references.For instance, the movie does not show Marilyn when she was happy at all (understanding she had a rough childhood).The way they showed her life ending was not at all how it happened. For example, how she was found dead and who saw her the last day of her life.It does not show her true relationship with Joe DiMaggio, or how before her death they were friendly again.It portrays her as a slut willing to do anything to get to the top which is wrong. If you read any book about Marilyn, writen by anyone who was close to her in her adult life, will describe her as a completely different person than she was played as in this so called documentary."
2,Ashly Judd,"I wasn't over the moon on this DVD and had expected more from Ashly Judd.However, it gave a different point of view of Ms. Monroe."
3,Interesting Concept...Poorly Executed,"The idea that Marilyn suffered from multiple personalities is an intersting concept... but it was poorly executed. The acting by both Ashley & Mira was occasionally over the top. Truthfully, I think it would have been much more powerful if it had been only one actress playing both parts. Josh Charles was horrifically underused."
3,casting error - horrible casting error,"Mira doesn't look anything like Marylin Monroe and it's very important in a film for an actress to look the part. And although Mira Sorvino can generally act in other movies, her performance in this film wasn't very good. Her voice is irritating. I think Ashley Judd's and Mira Sorvino's role should have been reversed. How did the casting directors make such mistake? Mira sorvino just doesn't look like a sex symbol."
3,What I learned about Marilyn,"I heard about this movie from a friend a couple years ago and thought I would buy it since it was a little more than renting it. I learned a lot Marilyn/Norma Jean from this movie. Not sure the accuracy, but was still very interesting to watch."
1,"Bad, bad , bad, bad, bad!","Did I watch the same movie that these other people are raving about? I thought this movie was complete garbage. Mira Sorvino was horrible as Marilyn Monroe, and I usually admire her work. This was probably the worst movie about her that I have seen. The script was bad, the acting was worse, and the movie just sucked. If you want to see a quality portrayal of Marilyn, try and catch a repeat of Quantum Leap when what's his name leaps into the body of her driver or bodyguard or whatever. The woman who played Marilyn was amazing. Not only did she look like her, but she had her voice down and facial gestures down pat! If I could give this movie a negative star rating I would."
1,Not Accurate!,"If you know anything about Marilyn, you will be annoyed by this movie. Many of the details are incorrect including costumes and Marilyn's appearance in earlier films. They had Marilyn as a platinum blonde in ""Don't Bother to Knock"" and ""Asphalt Jungle."" Wrong-she was blonde, but not platinum just yet! It is unfortunate that this movie will be a first look at Marilyn for some people. She is misrepresented as a person with multiple personalities and as an IV drug user. The one star is for Ashley Judd, Mira Sorvino however, doesn't look or sound anything like Marilyn."
3,Its ok,For what it is you can build it for much cheaper.. Also the supports under the mesh get clogged often. It's cool if it was 15 buck not 30 ! Happy miningPingpang
5,Real Real People,"Mike Leigh only now is becoming somewhat of a star to indy fans for his ability to depict people as they really are. His recent films, though, are a bit more Hollywoodized than his overlooked earlier ones. The characters in Home Sweet Home are so believable it's hard to believe that they're acting. None of them are the sharpest knife in the drawer, nor are they better than plain looking. In other words, they are real ""real people."" Which doesn't prevent them having interesting lives filled with the same sadness and joy we all feel, without the shameless slathering on and tear-jerking Hollywood can't seem to avoid. If you're looking for slice of life movies, you can't do better than this and other early Mike Leigh movies like ""Nuts in May,"" ""Four Days in July,"" ""Hard Labor,"" ""Grownups,"" and ""Who's Who."""
5,At last!,"I am glad that Vitamix started offering the smaller 32 oz blender container. Now I can leave the container on the powerbase and slide the whole thing under the counter. The 64 oz container is nice but it's really too large for my 2 person household, and I didn't like sacrificing additional counter space to store it. The new smaller container has an improved lid that has tabs on it so it's easy to remove. With the older lid, unless you have really large and strong hands, you have to pry it off with a spoon handle. I compared prices at a variety of sites and the price here at this time ($98) was the lowest that I found."
2,buy a dewalt,"My new Kett KE440 shears quit after one hour of use. Motor wasn't getting juice, loose wire. It took Kett an unreasonably long time to turn around the warranty repair, and they had to be called once and asked where is it. Seems the product quality is low, and the people aren't too concerned about their buyers. Buy a DeWalt, I did."
5,KETT Impressive,"Right out of the box, started cutting some 18 gauge stainless. Great for straight cutting and it will handle some rounded cuts. Nice addition to my tool box. Wish I would have had one a long time ago."
4,Let's Get Up An Dance,"A good mix of rock-n-rollin' Boppin' Blues, Boogie Woogie, early dance music. All the disc in this set by ACE are very good, with good sound quality. If you're looking for hard core rock-a-billy these CDs are probably not for you. But, then again we all need to expand our musical horizons some, they are worth the money and lots of fun to listen to.The Mean Eyed CatKNON Radio 89.3Dallas, Texas"
2,Deacon's voice too cutting,"The choir is indeed close to perfect. However, almost all of the cuts on the CD have either a Deacon or a soloist whose voice is much too cutting. A choir this good spoils you - indeed, you've died and gone to heaven, only to find one voice spoiling it. A call to prayer should not be a dentist's drill."
2,"yelling, not chanting","There is some very beautiful music on this CD, but several of the selections are marred by what I would describe as yelling, rather than chanting. The single male voice in a monotone accompanies beautiful choral voices. Sometimes this can be effective, but I just found this particular voice irritating"
3,Why...,"I dearly loved the movie, ""Cinderella Man,"" and the music in it. However, why on earth, on the CD, did they play only a minute, or less, of some of the best music? Like, ""Hope of the Irish,"" I liked that so much, but 52 seconds dosn't do it. In the film it was at least 3 minutes or more. I have decided not to buy the soundtrack simply because of this."
3,more like a pumpkin,"It's not that the music isn't good, there's just not enough of it. I'm no musician and certainly not a producer, but it seemed to me that the tracks included on this CD just weren't long enough. It was almost as though each track ended in mid-play and left me waiting for more."
1,Don't waste your money- RATING: ZERO STARS,I bought this watch in ladies royal blue and in less than 60 days it stopped working. I took it for a battery change but that did not make it run.The jeweler said the battery was still good. Amazon wouldn't take it back since it was over 30 days. MY ADVICE- DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON MOMENTUM PRODUCTS.
3,charley Smith is Charley Smith,"I loved CHIMNEY ROCK, but found that this didn't hold me as well. Still. Love this guys voice."
2,Avoid this version,"Between approximately the 30th minute mark and 40th minute, this DVD goes nuts. Artifacting, skipping, its virtually unwatchable for 10 minutes. Too bad, because its got some great action it it."
3,"Good, but not THAT good!",I love this film. Always have. But $70 for the widescreen DVD version???? You should get 10 of them for that price!
3,Return to Buddha,"This movie is for entertainment value. The acting is poor, the dialogue lacking and the ""plot"" not original. That being said, it has some great fight scenes. Certainly I bought it just to get the final battle into my library. Do not be fooled however, the action is really good in the other scenes as well but thaey are all overshadowed by the final battle.. There is much comedy. "" Young man, let me tell your fortune. hmm.. weak chin, beady eyes, prominent forhead lacks character...the future doen's look good for you!"" the reply.. "" If you can see the future then tell me... Where is..."" LOL!! This is a really predicatble story but never the less enjoyable. If the film transfer quality and acting were better, then the rating would be higher. Over all a reasonal DVD purchase."
5,"Beautiful kung fu, ok everything else","This movie is one of my favorite martial arts movies of all time.The acting and story is ok, but the kung fu is excellent.The form of the monk/brother of the main character is precise, and hisstyle is creative and beautiful to watch. Don't get hung up onthe other stuff and pay attention to what really on display here:exquisite movement."
4,THE'RE HEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,MORPHIEND MUSIC'S UNBREAKABLE IS THE BEST. LOOK OUT FOR THIS TEAM TO CHANGE THE HIPHIP/TRIPHOP/ACIDJAZZ GENRE....
3,Not quite what I thought it would be.,"This poster is blurry. I'm not sure what I expected because it was cheaper than another, duplicate sized poster on Amazon. The more expensive poster was probably produced w/ much more clarity. The picture on here looks like it was blown up from a much smaller image."
5,Identify the wild green in your path!,"The black ink line drawings by Regina O'Hughes, prepared from herbarium specimens, are exquisite in detail and scientific accuracy and are works of art, besides. The nearly 500 pages, drawings on right hand page (9 inches by nearly 7 inches), text and distribution map on left hand page, make this a comprehensive, yet easy to understand and use, reference book. First published in 1970 by the United States Department of Agriculture, this Dover republication book is a tremendous value for the money and its contents are as timely today as they were 30 years ago. These are the plants that Peterson Field Guides ignored. The book contains an extensive bibliography for those who want to further their study of these amazing plants. This book is definitely worth 5 stars!"
1,common weeds of the United States,The weeds in my pasture was identified by my local AG office and only 1 was in the book out of 5. As far as I'm concerned the book was useless to me.
5,"An exhaustive, in-depth look at the women involved","Collaboratively written by Lisa Appignanesi and John Forrester, Freud's Women: Family, Patients, Followers is an exhaustive, in-depth look at the women involved in the life and work of Sigmund Freud, who is often thought of as the father of modern psychology. Freud's many female patients, followers, and family members are surveyed and discussed in an informative blend of biography, history, and study of the founding of psychoanalysis. An exhaustively researched and detailed book, Freud's Women is very highly recommended for the History of Psychoanalysis academic reference collections, and Freudian Psychology supplement reading lists."
2,Echkart Tolle Findhorn Retreat DVD,The book is fine but one of the DVD's does not play at all in the DVD player. The other DVD worked fine.
1,Is it over yet?,"I like many speakers that break old paradigms, but Eckhart Tolle is definitely not one of them. Highly overrated and boring as hell. My spouse and I tried to watch this video in where he is in Findhorn, Scotland (thinking there might actually be stuff about the place) and there was NOTHING about Findhorn, Scotland. He just happened to be there when it was filmed at some hall. This video was many hours of him sitting completely still (he sat like a stiff puppet the whole time) with some flowers just plopped on the floor in front of him and no matter how many times we fast-forwarded to get to something ""good"", it never happened. From what I could see, even the audience was inanimate. I hope they didn't pay too much for the multi-hour torture session.Michael Beckwith, Gregg Braden, Louise Hay, and many others are far better than Tolle."
2,I loved this but . . .,"I love the book, unfortunately the dvds were defective, so I would wait to buy this untill they get a sgipment in that workd. What I was able to see/listen to, I did appreciate."
4,Tolle's Retreat like a vacation for the soul,"For those of you who met Eckhart Tolle through Oprah's webcast series, and thought that 18 hours wasn't quite enough, (and sometimes it isn't) here's four more. Tolle speaks with a simplicity that is both enlightening and empowering, and still makes you feel like kind of an idiot that you didn't think of this stuff yourself.I think that I would have preferred this as an audio rather than a DVD; not too many people have four hours to sit and watch a guy in a chair talk, and I understand an audio version is available. I have to say I don't think too much of the accompanying book. It doesn't add much to the package. But I recommend the DVD for its content, which takes you beyond even what he managed to cover on the Oprah webcast. You come away after even an hour refreshed, invigorated, and feeling great about life. It's like a weekend mini-break for the soul, and it is much appreciated."
4,Soothing Retreat,"I love this cd. I would have given it 5 stars for content but the recording isn't great in the beginning. If you like Eckhart then this will be a nice addition as he uses a lot of humor at this retreat and it made me laugh at the folly of us all in everyday life. But, if you are only going to buy one cd, then buy the cd of his book ""A NEW EARTH"". So much more information."
5,inner peace,"this is a fabulous set. i've only just borrowed it from my neighbor, but i don't know how i'm ever going to give it back. i've already listened to two of the CD's twice, but all four are wonderful. i believe it was in the third one that i 'woke up' for a few brief and wonderous moments. eckhart was talking about rolling up the scroll on which you have writen your life story...and so i did. it didn't last long, but it was the best i've ever felt. it was as if nothing would ever bother me again. i was unbotherable :) my mind was completely silent.lovely."
4,Very Much Worth the money and the time,"This DVD set will amaze you with how much a spiritual Teacher like E.T. can evoke on the apparently simple subject of (spiritual) stillness without boring you in the least (assuming you do care about spiritual matters)Overall I preferred the ""New Earth"" CD set, but this one is still a great piece. A final piece of advice: I strongly recommend the CDs over the book as they go down a lot easier and can equally easily be re-played (over and over)."
5,Engaging,"This is not only great reading, theres two dvds included. It gives one the chance to get a feel for a great teaching from Eckard Tolle. I liked it very much, as he describes something we can all experience, a particular part of us much deeper than the mind....being.Called living in the now, of what it is that brings peace, a realizaton of being free.By letting it be..the mind , in stillness, it made me see that we are not our minds. We have a mind, but we aint it.Though we need intellect and feelings to function as human beings,hanging on to them can cause problems.That all things must pass.Be willing to let them go.It is by being still, let it be, that we can be able to have a recognition of what he is explaining about.He is a great writer and articulates well. Found it to be very engaging and interseting.I recommend it whole heartedly."
5,Form and the Formless,"In the talks Tolle gives one of the most lucid and accessible elaboration on one essential cornerstone of spirituality - form and the formless, and guides the audience to re-vision the world and the universe as the unfolding interplay of the two. His points are consistent with the Buddha's view that form is empty and the empty is form (the Heart Sutra), and consistent with Lao-zi's teaching that the Tao is formless, transcends concepts, and yet gives birth to all form (Tao Te Ching). Form and the formless, are two faces of the same mystery that is life."
4,Tolle is Great,"What can I say, I'm getting all his stuff. I rated this 4 stars to separate it from his books which are 5 stars. This is a much simpler introduction to the Now. A prequel if you will.Also a must in MHO. It's a joy to watch Tolle, that is to see his Joy, brings joy to you. I now understand that someone in the moment can bring you there with him. Since I bought this DVD set after the books, there really was no new material. This should have been bought first. However, if you love Tolle this is a must have."
4,Insight - pure and simple...,"An avenue to perception, if you've the inclination to take a larger (and smaller) view. Like the Buddhist monk said when ordering a hotdog: ""One with everything..."""
4,TOLLE IS A TALISMAN,"AMAZING TO DISCOVER--AS HE WAS LECTURING IN HIS SENTIENT-BEING STYLE, ""JETS"" WERE FLYING OVER HEAD. NO O N E SEEMED TO NOTICE. HE IS PEACE PERSONIFIED."
1,VERY THIN!,"These belts are very thin. About half the weight as my old belt I took off after many miles on it. These just seem like there built cheap to me and at 1/2 the price this appears to be 1/2 the life too. Stiffer than other new belts Ive used in the past also. Only time will tell, but I would bet they wont go near the 80,000 miles my original Nissan belts got. I'll give it the nod for being quiet. If your looking for a cheap belt this is it. If long life is what your after buy an OEM if its for an Infiniti or Nissan there much better belts. Gates are great belts too.Update: Already had to tighten this goodyear belt twice,and its been on less than 1200 mi. Do yourself a favor and buy a gates. Once you put a gates on it never needs adjusted again. They are far more superior and the extra cost is so worth it because now I know this belt will be short lived. Just added to my cost. P.O.S."
4,The private worlds of autism,"Primetime's documentary of 3 boys with aspergers syndrom is a great overview of the struggles both the persons with aspergers and their families deal with on a daily basis. Each boy has an obsession with something: one with trains, one with washers and dryers, and one with game shows. If only others could understand the importance of these things, too!The show realistically portrays how the boys and their parents have had to adjust to the challenges that come with aspergers, particularly the difficulties in social situations, and what they are doing to ensure that they do not lose touch with the real world. This video increases anyone's understanding of the world of aspergers.Thank you for this!"
2,not worth buying,"I purchased this DVD in hopes that it would help me explain my son's Aspergers to family. However, it is very brief and general. The aspersers section of this DVD is only a few minutes long. It also is very generic. It is worth watching if it is free, but I can't recommend paying for it. I usually don't judge a product on its price, but this wasn't worth it."
3,Correct information but doesn't show how smart these kids really are,"Aspergers kids are intelligent and know more about their interests than the average adult. Many of our most important discoveries in our world were made by people who were ""different thinkers"". ABC Primetime does not show how intellegent Asperger kids really are. The movie states the basic facts but does not get into how people who are blessed with asperger's have really made a difference in our world."
2,Pricy,Interesting video but a little bit too pricy for a video that doesn't give very much detail at all.
1,Saxon Phonics1: Home Study Teaching tools,"I never received it, but I would have loved to have some of the items that are used such as the diagraph poster et al.."
4,Great Mask,The mask fits well but the picture you order from looks better than the mask actually does. Marketing in its finest.
4,Pretty good mask,"It's not as realistic as the picture, which seems really vivid. Also you can see your eye through the black screen of the missing eye hole. I think that takes away from the effect so I'll have to blacken around my eye so you can't see my eyelid and surrounding skin. I have to adjust the mask occasionally so I can see out of the one eye hole. I'm female so my head is probably a little smaller than the ""average"" size. I think I'll scare some people, we'll see."
3,Dissapointed,"I bought this book thinking that these designs would be easy to do,but you have to purchase other items to complete the designs, so add this into the price if you are going to buy this book, i wouldn't recommend it, unless you have the money for the items that are in the second page of this book, to complete some of the designs in the book you need waterproof body liners, A commercial stampand three inking pads, white mendi stick, liquid water colours made for the skin, a paintbrush or eyeliner brush, makeup sponges, and a lot of other tools of the trade to many to mention, so I was dissapointed with this book as I thought they would be easy to do, they look easy in the photo on amazon.co.uk but they are not as you need all sorts of stuff too much stuff to mention as you need a foam back board and other stuff also, I have learned one valuable lesson from buying this book I will never buy a book whhich hasn't been reviewed.Thanks for reading my review"
4,Hard to put down.,"Time Bomb by Jonathan Kellerman is yet another great mystery with Alex and Milo, this time trying to make sense of a shooting at an elementary school. At first the shooter seems an unlikely candidate for the crime, but as Alex attempts to counsel the school's traumatized kids he begins to suspect the shooter was also suffering from the effects of a childhood trauma. When asked by the father to conduct a psychological autopsy he agrees even though there is little hope for the vindication the father is hoping for. He and Milo dig deeper into the senseless crime and discover it's all a lot bigger than it seemed. Old hippies, Nazis, and a narcissist genius, fill the pages along with radicals from the left and right, crooked politicians, fraudulent psychologists and a cop with questionable ethics. This story has something for everyone and a surprise ending that makes you smile."
4,Nice Plotting,"I couldn't put this book down last night--and read until one AM. Thank goodness I had a vacation day to finish it! I liked this book much better than the last one of the series that I read (Silent Partner). Alex and Milo investigate a school shooting and uncover a years-old mystery involving Nazis, 60s radicals, dopers, crooked politicians, and the Holocaust. But not is all as it seems. Robin is out of the picture (YES!), and a new love interest is introduced. Believable, well researched story."
4,A Matter of Time,"Dr. Alex Delaware is called to a grade school where there was sniper fire during recess. Milo Sturgis the detective asked him to help the children cope with the situation and move on with their life. The sniper is quickly identified. However the sniper's father is certain that it is not his son and asks Alex to investigate. He is sure that Alex can clear his son. This is a real challenge and one that Alex welcomes. There are all kinds for different problems that get in Alex's way, even another psychologist wanting to take over the therapy of the children. The book keeps your attention as Alex tries to unravel all the problems facing him. By Ruth Thompson author of ""The Bluegrass Dream"""
1,Kindle version bombs,"I have purchased many of the Kindle version books with numerous typos but could usually figure out what was intended. This one had so many errors, it took away my enjoyment. The story was great, but each page had many errors; some indecipherable. I wish there were some way I could correct these, so that next time I pull up the book, it will be easier to read, or better yet for other purchasers to read. I would even be willing to check out the printed version to correct it."
5,The Best Christmas Music I Own,I am a music director for a gospel radio station and own approximately 1000 CDs of which approximately 100 are Christmas music. This CD is by far the most exciting one that I have in my collection. I purchased it in 1998 and already we are getting requests for the music this year. My hat is off to a great artist and I urge everyone if they are going to own just one CD or Tape this is the one to buy.
5,Absolute Best Office Reference Manual,"I have used the How series since spring 1983, when I took my first office technology course in college, and our required reference manual was How 5. I am now up to How 8. This book is comprehensive, easy to understand, gives good examples, and is well indexed for ease in quickly looking up what you have a question on. I really love the ""Words Often Confused and Misused"" chapter, which helps you use the correct word in text (affect/effect; assure/ensure/insure, etc.). I highly recommend this book to all secretaries; clerks; report writers; journalists; anyone who works with the written word and needs to produce an intelligent-looking product where correct punctuation, capitalization, formatting and word use are important."
5,The Best collection ever of the DUPREES,If you were and still are a fan of the Duprees you absolutely must buy thiscollection of the Coed Recordings. BUY THIS NOW!
5,The Duprees Forever,"Here is absolute perfection in oldies. So many things came together here. 31 songs of heartfelt love performed with the greatest of sincerety. Here is a seamless merging of the swing orchestra sound combined with rock beat & high energy doo-wop vocals and soaring crescendos by the lead singer Joey Vann (aka Joey Canzano). On this one great ""Ace Records"" disk are all of the Duprees ""Coed Records"" recordings remastered. The Duprees hold a very special place in music history & this is a collectors item!"
4,OSI Marine Lab Mountain with Trees Medium Aquarium Ornament,I bought this med. one for my 12 gal. tank because I already have the large one in my 30 gal. tank. My fish love this ornament. They swim in & out & even stay inside it & just hang out. Best purchase for my fish I ever made.
3,"Very Classy, perhaps too much so at times","This is a nice smooth, classy recording of the classic Swingle sound. I guess the relentless nature of that sound from track to track gets a bit much to make this a single-session-listen-to-it-all type of record. Soul Bossa is very good indeed. Much as like this album I would recommend Beauty and the Beat Box for anyone wanting a wider range of material by the Swingle Singers on one album."
3,There are actually 75 ways listed...,"They kinda cheat a little. There are only 75 ways listed (they start numbering with chapters like ""how to work with your subcontractor,"" in order to get a total of 101 chapters.Further, it's on a five-star rating system: only four star and five star items are considered cost beneficial. It would be a lot nicer to focus on the four and five star stuff, and leave the excess out. I don't want to read about things it costs me more money to do than I'll get back in selling: I just want to know what those things are, so I don't concentrate on them."
2,not what I was expecting,too common sense; I expected things like advice on whether to do carpet verses hardwood floor or tile
3,Attention 350z,If you are to replace the OEM belt this one will only fit 07+ and if you are getting this for a 03 too 06 this gatorback belt is too long well for me it was too long just a lil heads up im still looking for the one that will fit size ill post update when i find out unless some of you already know. hope this will save u the wait time and fitment issue and takeing all the thing you have to take off just too look and not be the rite one. I gave it 3 star cause they need to fix the fitment they have setup for amazon. this belt dose not fit 03 to 06 Z
1,Not a handbook for me,"This book contains mostly poems. Most of the poems seem to be centered around the pain of infertility and none about moving on. I understand that the book is about infertility, but I thought it would have some uplifting words. I really did not find any. There seems to be a lot of pain in the book and little if any healing words. I was quite disappointed in it. The book also talks about the 12 step program that is used for alcoholics. I do not feel that the steps pertain to me as an infertile person.I prefer a book that has a more positive, upbeat tone. I may be infertile, but I don't feel sorry for myself. Sweet Grapes is a positive book that I suggest."
1,Author is bitter,The author seems to hold resentment for not being able to have children. A few of the poems were okay. I did not find the book helpful in helping me with my own infertility. It was a big disappointment.
1,What is this?,I listened to the 4 tracks on your site and ancient chants sound like a jazz trio. This must be a mistake
3,Outdated,"This software is more than two years old, and has been succeeded by three new generations of Mandriva software, the latest being the Mandriva 2007.1 Power Pack.It wasn't a bad desktop when it was issued, but the Mandriva 10.2 version issued in October 2005 far exceeded this one in quality, and although 2007.1 still has bugs, it is still better, too.If you're going to try Mandriva, go with a version no earlier than 10.2, and preferably a later one.Or, if you're a newbie, try Ubutnu or Kbuntu to start: those, unlike Mandriva, are totally free, and the versions are regularly updated at 6 month intervals."
4,A Simple Pleasure,"In the land of the Amazons, somewhere near China an evil Queen has made men slaves. Her one true love was dupped into betraying her and she has never forgiven him or her sister who dupped him. She made men slaves and has become more sadistic with each year of her reign. Of course there is a prophecy about the man who can take her throne. That man is played with quiet charm and elegance by Jaycee Chan, son of Jackie Chan. I love this movie movie despite it's flaws, the major one being why the evil queen is so darn mad over one simple mistake, he slept with her twin thinking it was her...she's knows he was set up but she hates anyway. Despite many great sacrifices on his part and a lifetime of devotion to earning her forgivness, she just get's madder.This movie is full of lush colors and simple pleasures. My boyfriend gave it to me and I have seen The Twins Effect part 1, the Twins are the connection in these movies. It's still a delight for the senses."
1,Not worth the money,"I had high hopes for this product, but I was sadly disappointed and had to return it. It is overpriced and really not worth the time."
5,Great Money-Making Ideas for Experts,"As a publisher, I love it when authors give presentations to promote their books. Vickie gives a lot of practical, ""try this tomorrow"" tactics that can boost sales after every speech. It's obvious that she knows her stuff -- this material is fresh, not the basic information you hear elsewhere. The Web-basedmaterial also has a lot of details too. Any one who speaks to promote their product or services could benefit from this information."
1,When No One's Listening,"You're kidding, right? FIVE stars for this Zuzu's Petals release? Oh now I see: The FIVE star customer review is coming from Mpls. Explains everything."
5,Gorey Meets Addams Meets Burton,"If you're a fan of Edward Gorey, Charles Addams and/or Tim Burton, this book is for you."
4,Dark and miserable... but kinda cute,"This story is so sad. It's all about a little girl who is completely unloved by everyone. All she wants is for a friend, someone who'll love her unconditionally. She wishes upon a star - and gets Mr Creazil! But Mr Creazil isn't all he seems...Great story, but not really for little kids. It's quite dark, and would probably be enjoyed more by teenagers and adults."
5,Best Book,This is probably the BEST story I have ever read. It is very..... Spooky I should say. Katy Towell is my new favirot author because of this book.
3,Rasputin DVD,Rasputin (1996) VHS was basically good but the colors sometimes fluctuated. Maybe this is a function of the age of the VHS It is 13 years old. That is my only concern.
2,"Great actors, bad script--see it for the locations","I was very disappointed in this movie. Ian MacKellen and Alan Rickman did the best they could with a very bad script (how many times must Rasputin moan ""I didn't ASK to be holy!""?) and factual errors (Rasputin was a nickname, not Father Gregory's surname, etc.). Greta Sacchi was miscast as Alexandra, she didn't have the acting talent or the physical resemblance needed. The locations were great and it is worth renting the film to see them. I can't recommend you purchase the movie though."
1,Conumer Beware,"Be advised, you need a multi regional DVD player to view this film. I purchased this movie from an Amazon reseller just to find out it wouldn't play on my DVD player. The reseller has a warning in small print telling the purchaser that there are NO refunds for this problem. Be warned..."
1,DOES NOT PLAY ON USA DVD PLAYERS! PAL FORMAT,"WATCH OUT, THEY DO NOT PUT IT IN THE TITLE, BUT THIS IS A DVD IMPORT REGION 2 DVD THAT DOES NOT PLAY ON USA DVD PLAYERS! PAL FORMAT"
3,"Decent Rasputin, but not the best.","I like Alan Rickman, but he never got me to stop thinking ""Here's an Irish actor, hamming it up as Rasputin"".Save your money, and instead get the readily available ""Nicholas and Alexandra"". Tom Baker IS Rasputin!!! Far better than Rickman."
4,Chinese knock-off,"This battery set cost me only about 1/3 what a ""real"" RBC6 replacement set from APC would have cost. While the ratings printed on the side of the cells were the same as the original APC cells, the cells did not appear to be quite as substantial, I elected to reuse the fuse strap from the original RBC6 rather than the one shipped with the replacement because it was of thicker gauge. The replacement set has ridden through several power outages since I installed it and did it's job just fine. Time will tell whether the cases will leak or have other aging problems. At the moment, I am satisfied and would probably opt to purchase this replacement battery set again."
1,Battery is wrong size for RBC6 Replacement,when looking at the RBC6 battery set spec on APC web site it looks to me like there is no way this battery set will go into the chassis. Has anyone gotten this to fit into the RBC6 battery spot in their ups??
5,RBC6 UPS Replacement battery great all-around buy,"I was pleased to find this alternative to the OEM replacement. The price was great, the shipper exceeded expectations and got the battery here before their projected receive date.I was pleased the battery fit perfectly and I did not have to scavenge cables or jumpers from the old battery; I slid the old battery out, unhooked the cable, slid the new one in and connected the leads.I was back on-line in a matter of 5 minutes. Highly recommend this item as a cost-effective alternative to the OEM replacement.I cannot vouch for battery longevity since I have had this item installed for only 2 weeks, but so far it has not wavered in performance."
2,boring stuff,"I found this book the worst of the entire harpers series. It took me at least four times as long as all the other books to finish. I actually had to force myself to read it to the end. I don't know if it's because of the Shou background, but this novel has nothing of the spirit a good FR book should have."
2,missing somethng,"Though an easy read, as most FR books are, I found this one dry and not as interesting as the other Harper books. I found myself not realy careing about Rusha, or any of the other Characters. This may be do to the fact that the author introduced almost all of the characters and did not spend time developing them. The Dragonlinch Cypress and the ship Captian Fowler were the only desirably interesting Characters. I was dissapointed that the author did not use them to the potential. Lastly, the book overall was missing that key ingredient that makes a Harper book, a Harper Book."
1,Wha???,"This is the worst novel Troy Denning has ever produced. I found Parched Sea to be entertaing enough that I read VD immediately after, and I was really disappointed. The main character, Ruha, was left of in Parhed Sea, having finally found her place in her tribe, in VD she has left her tribe to become a Harper with little to no explanation. The Shou are treated as though they had the language skills of a monkey. Were I Asian I would be very upset. Basically, this story could have had anyone in Ruha's place and it would have been the same tale."
1,Enough with the stereotypes already!,"I think if I were Oriental I would be offended by this book. It's not uncommon at all for FR authors to incorporate real world nationalities into their stories, and its usually done to good effect. But for some reason, when some authors write Oriental characters, they always have ridiculously poor English. It was so annoying, reading the dialogue of the Shou characters. All of them were wealthy, socially high ranking, international figures, so is it too unrealistic for the author to imagine that they could have mastered English better than a native-speaking 3-year old child. Come on already! As for the rest of the book, Ruha is about as interesting as cardboard and so was the plot."
2,Book Report,"Blind Date was an okay book. I thought it was confusing sometimes though. I don't think that it's the best book, but it was alright. Blind Date was about a guy named Kerry who was set up for a blind date with Mandy from his school. Mandy was kind of strange. Like the time she picked up Kerry dressed up in a poncho(which is a rain coat). I thought this book was kind of neat though when Mandy would stick up for Kerry, because the football players would pick on him. Thwe reason they picked on him was because he broke the starting quaterback's leg on their football team so he quit. Later on you'll find out if Mandy is the girl of Kerry's dreams or a real nightmare for Kerry. I recommend this book for people that like mystery books."
1,False advertising,False advertising: Product description says (pack of 10)quantity shipped (1)Vendor claims they have no control over description of product
5,Excellent AP review material,"Condensed, learner-friendly, a few helpful charts/graphs/drawings included. Lots of key word definitions and bullets. Must get the 2nd volume as well to cover all the material."
3,"OK, but not as good as Baby Bargains","I had a chance of checking out this book, trying to find things that would make my day saving money in getting things we needed for our baby. The truth is I felt it to be very week in comparison to ""Baby Bargains"". Most of the information listed consists largely of links to sites for different categories of baby stuff. Want to obtain the same info? Go to Goggle and type a keyword that relates to what you're looking for. Not worth spending the money on it, in my opinion, but check it out on your next visit to your local bookstore with a cup of coffee."
3,A year old & Terribly OUTDATED!,"most of the info in this book is terribly outdated, by more then a year.. websites missing, offers completely invalid.. etc.this is still an ok reference of companies and their locations, and potential offers, alot of offers noted for parents of multiple children. (if mailing just verify the address)I am with another reviewer.. I LOVE Baby Bargains.. it is THEE BEST Book out there, so is Baby 411 (Books by the Fields they are awesome!)"
2,Less Then Average,There are two many good books out there that cover this topic. This one is average and unless you own it I would not pick it up.
1,Broken after less than a year,We bought our Frigidaire dishwasher when we moved into our new house. It has not yet been a year and the control board is already broken....
1,terrible dishwasher,"we bought ours less than two years ago because it was supposed to be the quietest from lowes......what a joke...it takes TWICE as long to wash because of the ""quiet"" feature and NOW it is making SO MUCH NOISE it's ridiculous.....the one that we had before LASTED Almost 20 years---wish i could remember what it was."
1,Poor quality,"We bought a 6 year old house with matching Frigidaire Gallery Stainless appliances. So far in the past 4 months, we had to have the freezer repaired, the stove repaired, and now the dishwasher. On a good point, the microwave has worked flawlessly. That should blow up in a week or two.In my experience, Bosch are worth the price, built great and quiet. Not sure about Bosch's customer service because their products don't break so I never had to call."
5,Excellent Scholarship and Good History,"Professor Lee gives us a scholarly review of a microcosm of the culture and weltanshauung of a relatively backwater Maryland county headed into revolution. That such scholarship is targeted at a minor topic is truly impressive. If anything, it gives one pause as to whether the investment in academic research in history is overdone. For here is a representative picture drawn, but at such detail it must have taken tremendous resources. One wonders what topics suffer to give such infinite color to a tiny leaf on a giant tree. But the beauty of scholarship and solid writing for those interested in this topic, such as genealogists or revolutionary war scholars, will find this book a delightfully sharp and detailed portrait of a place whose most might town was the now unremembered ""Port Tobacco."""
1,Battery did not fit. t=,"Battery did not fit. To small, have to stuff paper in it to make it snap lock in and now the back falls out cause the tabs are to short"
2,great except for profanity,"We all know that Truman, as good a man as he was, used profanity. Too bad the producers felt that it had to be shared with the world. Young people pick up disrespectful language from movies. We could have learned just as much about Truman's life without the language."
2,Truman,"I didn't order this DVD because I had a lot of expectations of it. After all, it's about Truman's life -- what's so dramatic about Truman's life and presidency that you can make an exciting movie about them? The movie about John F. Kennedy, who was a lot more interesting person than Truman, had to focus on the Cuban Missile Crisis in order to make it interesting. And so this movie about Truman focused on the decision to use the bomb on Japan, and if you asked me, what moral dilemma was there about using the bomb? As far as I can seek, they should have used it far sooner to end the war. So, I ordered this DVD without expecting a lot, and I could barely watch the entirety of the movie, because I felt it was so slow-going. I'm sorry that I can't be more generous about the movie, but I am being honest."
2,Picture great; DVD inproperly marked,Truman: It is marked CC and isn't. I have made formal comp;lain but am told I am not properly setting for CC. I have 600 DVD's and have used them since they were first offered. I know how a DVD works. Disgusted with this source.
4,Interesting,"I'm not worried about actors and directors. I want to know something new when I view a movie like this, and this was an eye opener!! It is a must see for all of us boys and girls who were raised in homes of FDR haters. Guess there aren't many left today. Not that it is about FDR, but it will open your eyes about Truman, who he was, and his wisdom which most under-estimated. You know a little old haberdasher."
3,BIZARRE,"Here is the only docudrama we have dealing with our 33rd President Harry Truman, and the performance of Gary Sinise makes it well worth watching - - - until ""Give Em Hell"" Harry catches up to General of the Army Douglas MacArthur. The actor chosen to play MacArthur and the way he was presented was so completely wrong one wonders why the director bothered including the MacArther episode at all.Didn't anybody consult a newsreel or look at a photo of MacArthur beforehand?The argument that this was entertainment not a history lesson doesn't hold up because the casting of Sinise and the way he was presented was so right on."
2,Not the greatest underwear,I didn't like these because the elastic is way too tight on the legs. It made the leg openings look like diapers and they cut into my skin and there is definitely a visible panty line. The only good thing about them is the fabric is soft.
5,Beautiful record,"This is one of the most underappreciated albuns of 1990's. Great songs, catchy chorus,fine melodies and creative lines. Following the tradition from Mineapolis rock. It rules!"
4,Outnumbered!,"I live in a one human, two dog household. This booklet--I did know this would be a booklet, and I am glad for the concise help--has really helped me build my relationship with the dogs and has reminded me of how to stay in the lead."
4,A great way to start your multiple dog household,"This is a book you can read in a night, maybe two if you are still housetraining a puppy (ask me how I know) but it packs a lot of practical and manageable information into its small package. There are no instant solutions for dog training. Having a household of well behaved dogs is work in the same way that having a household of well behaved toddlers is work, so I think it's important for people to have reasonable expectations of what any book can offer on this topic. But if you want to hit the ground running, with solid tips and techniques for managing your most likely and common problems, this book will get you started and lists tons of additional resources for further reading."
5,Feeling outnumber?,"Yes! We have five canines in the household so life can become very chaotic. The book offers many great suggestions (for example, how to keep your dogs waiting respectfully at the door for guest) and how to keep your sanity under trying conditions. I recommend this book for any family one have more than one canine living in their house!"
5,"Great book, fast read","This book was very informational. I learned alot about the multiple dog household. It also confirmed things I had thought but didn't really know, such as; having a group name for your animals to respond to, training the dogs individually to get basic commands first before expecting them to respond in a group.... And just getting over your guilt of trying to always make things fair and equal for all of them. Its a great book that I will read and reread."
3,wish there was more details.,"I found the book to have many common sense points. but not enough direction for unique group situations. I wanted more information, not just a booklet. The overall impression was that it was a good review of common sense points, which many people don't have with their pets. If you have not information about dogs, dog packs or dog behavior this will work for you. if you do have that basic information you may be disapointed with this book."
3,Multi dog,I did not find this book interesting nor did I learn anything from it. I would not recommend this to any dog buyer.
1,No help,"This book does not provide any special insight into training more than one dog. Guess what, each dog needs to be trained individually. Now you don't need to buy the book."
2,"Overly restrictive, over priced","Be sure to notice the length of this pamplet--I mean, ""book."" The price per page is not small.If you want to run your home like a British kindergarten and raise your dogs to be proper gentle folk, you might like this little advisory. But if I were going to run my ""pack"" like this, I wouldn't bother having dogs.After following the advice in this book for a week, my wife and I were ready to get rid of our new, second dog. A neighbor with multiple dogs, thank God, said, ""You're reading too much. Let them be dogs."" We listened. The dogs are happier and so are we.What's worth reading in here, you can find in McConnell's much cheaper ""How to Be the Leader of Your Pack."""
5,W.S. Merwin,Images of nature no where nearly cover the symbolism Merwin's poems have. Figurative phrases can be found through out. The mind longs to read them again in their extended absence.
4,"Good condition, packaged nicely.","This booked was shipped in good condition, and the description online fit the condition of the book. Thank you."
4,excellent if you have somone helping you,this book is so good only if you have some one helping you ...or if you are the teacher....it has all the grammar and lots of exercise and conversation it's perfect...but not much translation or announcing the word
2,"Perhaps, just rhetoric!","Despite the praise heaped on this text, I can't help feeling that Bernard Faure has been constructing the 'straw men' other readers have spotted. It is by no means certain that the Ch'an (Zen) tradition has functioned as Faure suggests. Why, for instance, set up the 'anti-scriptural' argument - only to concede - on proper investigation, that it is a myth? There are enough commentaries - on the sutras, by Zen monks, to make this sort of thing seem pointless. Sorry, but lets place trust in those deluded masters of old - and stay unenlightened, Faure style."
2,No Real Light,Ordered to use on a work bench. High intensity; hardly these are very yellow light.Can't think of a place to use them except for mood lighting in some weird Sci-Fi Bar.
3,watch out for color bleeding,"I love this watch, except the band. The band is a p ink suede that bleeds all over my towels and clothes every time i wash my hands. It is such a problem I had to replace the watch band with a standard leather band. Couldn't find a band that wide in some pretty color, so had to go with a boring brown band. But the watch itself is so cute, I still love the watch"
3,"This is a USB 1.1 device, NOT 2.0 !!!!!","No matter what you read here, this device is absolutely not USB 2.0 compatible. It will work ok with 2.0 devices but WILL NOT operate at 2.0 speed. I tried it with a new USB flash drive and got a speed of less than 1/10th that without this hub attached in-between the device and the pc (~800kb using the hub, ~10Mb without the hub). I repeat ... NOT USB 2.0.Not only that, but it came with a sticker on the front that read ""This item intended for sale at Walgreens. If found at other outlets call 1-800-xxx-xxx"". I wonder if I should call ;-)"
2,Junk.,"I have a Micro$oft Intellimouse and a simple Logitech keyboard, It can barely handle that without shorting out. GE should stick to bombs, obviously they do what they need to."
1,Worst movie I have ever seen.,"I am not sure what compelled me to purchase this movie. Maybe it was the cheap pricetag...but it was awful. I was completely stunned by how terrible it actually was. The ending was the worst. It reminded me of a cheap knockoff of ""Sleepaway Camp""."
3,He will destroy anyone that gets in his way.,"When I viewed this film, I felt like I was watching a storyline that I have seen before. I thought this was slightly scary, but nothing to keep me up at night. The ending is the best part. I would say a rental would be good enough."
3,Good film!,I had heard about this film some time ago. I found here and decided to purchase it. I have to say the film imo is good-not fantasitic as I was expecting. I did like the way they portrayed Laurent's parents reaction was very real. I don't know how I feel about the ending? Perhaps I could say it left me with the hope that things would get better with time.
4,I tought this movie was pretty good.,"The movie is in Frech i believe so you have to read the subtitles, wich is a bit distracting, but the plot makes up for that. It is way better than the last few movis i have purchased that are gay related. The acting wasent the best but it was pretty good. I would recomend this movie to others."
3,Would have got 5 stars.....,Movie is wonderful if you speek French or can read really fast but then miss the content of the movie. Did not see anywhere that listed it as a French only movie.
4,Two thumbs way up,"To accept yourself is to love thyself. A motivating film if you, gay or whatever, have not come out to your family or at least been honest with them."
4,Incredibly REAL and moving,This is one my favorite movie selections! I love the way the French can capture real life; nothing Hollywood about this move!
4,EXCELLENT FILM,"THIS FILM IS WELL-WRITTEN, AND WELL-ACTED. FOR WE DREAMERS OF AMORE TOLERANT SOCIETY, THIS IS A TIMELESS STORY THATIS ALWAYS APPEALING. A BEAUTIFUL FRENCH FILM."
5,american movies never do this!,"Excellent movie, engaging actors who make you care about what happens. The subject matter is never addressed in american films as well as this, even with subtitles it is a gem. Highly reccomend for its frank and current look at a male love story. This is reality in a movie!"
4,Great action!!!!!,I really liked James Bennnett's martial arts skills and think he has a very bright future in action movies.
1,Wool loops,"Received the items on time and they are wool and stretch just fine. I am very dissapointed in the colors in the bags I ordered. I ordered 2 bags to have enough loops to make 6 potholders. Both bags have very dull boring colors. Only 4 colors in each bag, green, purple, beige and gold. The picture showed many colors which was what I was hoping for. I would have like to known there were only 4 colors in each bag. I got 36 beige, 32 purple, 15 green and 23 gold."
4,Love the wool potholders,"These are quality wool potholder loops. The resulting potholders are thick, functional and heat resistant. I just like the way wool looks and feels much better than synthetic or even cotton.My only complaint would be the color selection. We got almost all purple, teal, gold, and white. No blues, very few greens or reds. Still, my daughters love this activity and have made many great potholder gifts."
3,wool loops,"Thank goodness someone is still making wool loops, they were a little expensive. My biggest complaint is the colors are a little dull. But when you're prone to dropping your pot holder directly on a burner, you need the wool. Trust me."
3,Not really happy,I purchased 2 bags of the potholder loops. There was a limited mix of colors (lots more of a couple colors) and no black. Not what I received last Christmas when I ordered 2 bags through Amazon.Wool Loops - Large Bag Multi Color
2,A little dissapointed,"Wanted to have a watch that not only was attractive and tough as well as being water resistant, but being easy to read. The minute hand was almost non visible at a quick glance. It is even hard to see unless you have good eyesight for close up.On the plus side, it is attractive and tough. I replaced the band also being unhappy with the buckle."
2,Buy Thomas Jefferson books instead!,"For those of you who believe our Founding Fathers' intentions were for America to be a Christian nation, you will love this book. If you read Jefferson for yourself, and believe in his strong feeling for a ""wall of separation between church and state"", you will not like this book. Hence, my 2 star review. Jefferson was brilliant, enlightened and way ahead of his time. This book does not do him justice.!"
5,Informational,I used to be a classroom teacher and now I am considering homeschooling my children. I found this book to be very informative and helpful. I think this is a must read for any parent who believes that it is important to have our children have leadership qualities.
4,Good Quality at a resonable price,I would highly recommend this tool for the do-it-yourselfer who wants a professional quality tool to do sheet metal cutting on a not so regular basis. It is made to much the same standards as Ketts commercial products but at half the cost.
3,Not up to date,"Great maps, great info, but not up to date with today's wine market. Many AOCs and DOCs that have started to produce great wine in the last 10 years aren't given their due. Go for the updated (2002) version.If you are just looking for maps though, then the price on this book (esp. used copies) can't be beat..."
2,cheezy,"This song might have passed for ""cool"" and ""new"" about 10 years ago, but on the verge of 2005, it just sounds cheezy and lame. Give the free download a shot before actually spending money on this old skool garbage."
2,Great concept when it works,I got my first pot and it worked great for 3 weeks. Called manufacturer and they were very nice and sent me a new cord as they thought that was the problem when it completely stopped working...that was not the problem so they sent me another bottom and it went right to ready with no boiling....they sent me a third pot and it worked great for 3 days when it also stopped boiling and went right to ready. Great concept when it works...I'm now going to ask for a refund and try another brand.
1,worked 1 ish time,"I got this unit 2nd hand but bran spanking new, opened the cord from the plastic and inserted it in the outlet. I had to wiggle it just right to get the unit on but now I tried again and I can't even get the unit to turn on. I also don't like how it has to be powered to dispense the water."
4,Sunpentown hot water pot,"Sunpentown hot water pot works very well, I have been using it for 4 years. This is second one I have"
5,Musical Candy,"I can't think of enough good things to say about this album. It's certainly not what anyone, even a real Buckethead fan, would expect; but that's true of every Buckethead release I've ever heard. Pop in this CD and prepare for a musical journey through Bucketheadland, Buckethead's imaginary theme park filled with monsters, robots, and rides that don't have names . . . Hear Buckethead duel Bansheebot, utilizing his mastery of the deadly sonic arts . . . Meet Giant Robot and join him in his battle against the evil Guillatine . . . And not only do we have a great theme album here, but get a load of Buckethead's guitar skills! This guy is probably one of the best guitarists alive, and I'm not just saying that because I'm a huge fan. His passages range from dark and mysterious to heavy and grinding to silly and fun to just plain mind-numbingly UNBELIEVEABLE! I'll wrap this up with three words: BUY THIS CD!"
4,Tremendous Guitar work,Buckethead the nameless guitarist wails once more. A shred king of the six strings. Very fast guitar work with snippits of amusing dialogue. If you like Praxis this is more guitarcentric even with Bass assistance via Bootsy Collins. An album which helps test the envelope of what music can sound like.
4,A must for fans. Not the best introduction for beginners.,"If you dig Buckethead, then you should own this disc. However, if you are just getting started with his amazing music, the first Praxis album or the more recent solo effort, called Monsters and Robots, might be better choices.Buckethead Land has all of the Buckethead trademarks you have come to expect, plus some long passages consisting of various samples and keyboard parts. My favorites are the samples from Johnny Socko And His Flying Robot. If you dig the Buckethead schtick, then you'll dig it. If you don't then you won't."
3,Decent for a Wal Mart buy,"It works and its not expensive. Fine for home use, but Kline is better. a big help would have been each bit have a flat head and phillips on each side instead of them being seperate making you flip the barrel over to go from flat to phillips. Personally I prefer a Wiha drive-loc with assorted blades. The handle will take about any torx, hex, nut driver you can think of and last forever. Not everyone likes having 4 blades to keep up with but so much better quality."
2,Some problems,"I bought this item because I thought nice that this item has 4 individual cricket displays. But I have returned this item because of following problems.1)Website description says that it has 25 Games, but actually it has only 5 games. 20 out of 25 are not Games but Options.2)Too many bounce outs.3)Even when darts sticks out of circle, it register sometimes.4)Power button and Reset button are in a place where it can accidentally be clicked by dart stick. There's no lock to keep that from happening."
3,It stole my attention,"Let's make this simple: The film has a style about it generated through colorful characters including the always perfect, Alec Baldwin. The direction was slick and the story was good enough to keep me interested throughout. Although the dialogue is somewhat contribed, it still found a way to put a smile on my face. It's certainly worth giving a try. Who knows... It might surprise you and end up on your shelf someday."
2,Alec - What happened?,"Usually Alec Baldwin is a good actor -- not this time. The movie was too slow. You could get some laughs, but overall it was disappointing.Michael Jai White is just not a good actor -- I could have done better!!"
5,ALEC BALDWIN AT HIS BEST,"ONE OF MY TOP 10 FAVORITE DVD'S. BALDWIN IS ALL OVER HIS CHARACTER IN THIS MOVIE. YOU COULD LET YOUR GRANDMA WATCH THIS ONE. NO SEX, NO WOMEN, NO CURSING OR ANY OF THE OTHER HOLLYWOOD COME ONS. IT IS EVEN HUMOROUS AT MANY TIMES. GOOD LUCK WALLY........................."
5,Fast paced revenge,"I heard the description of this movie and I wasn't interested. But this movie surprised me. I certainly wasn't expecting a dark comedy that kept me laughing. The cast did a wonderful job. I especially loved the performances of Alec Baldwin and Michael Jai White. (The two of them are so gorgeous, they are reason enough why any woman would love this film.) I highly recommend this film."
5,Witty cop/robber/gangster film,"This film is tightly managed, has great music and is beautifully done. I found it by accident while channel surfing through cable--couldn't catch it before it went off the cycle so ordered as soon as it was available. Alec Baldwin, Andre Braugher, and every other actor are absolutely perfect. The script is so full of delightful turns of phrase, I can't quote anything without giving away subplots which are entertaining and, in some cases, charming. (Attention animal lovers.) The characters are believable and thoroughly enjoyable.There are a LOT of bad words; some people die (they deserved it), and there is (limited) drug use. It deserves the R rating.Every time I watch this movie I hear or see something that I missed before. Janeane Garafalo is magnificent in a tiny part."
4,Enjoyable show!,"As with a lot of the British tv shows, this one is good entertainment. I believe it is also showing as a series on PBS or BBCAmeica"
5,Enjoyable,"I have really enjoyed Season One of ""Call the Midwife"". I'm hoping there will be more. Very entertaining. Some intrigue, some romance, and some laughter. A good mix."
4,"Call the Midwife, BBC program, trailer","Well written, engaging & intriguing. I only gave it a four because it was the trailer. I was obviously intrigued enough to want more than just that snippet. I've read one of the books by Jennifer Worth that the program is based upon & intend to read more as well as watch online as well as purchase the DVD's. Her book was wonderful, truth told in novel fashion, told in the first person, as if you were there. As I read it I was thinking it would make a wonderful series. When I finished & went looking for more books by Worth & discovered that she not only had written numerous books from that period of her life but that indeed the UK already had a series airing there. I purchased my book some four years ago & just got around to reading it. My timing was perfect! A definite must read/must watch for anyone interested in medicine, post WWII England, or life in the East End, which is no more."
4,Enjoying this very much,"I began watching these during the winter hiatus for most of the shows I usually watch. I was pleasantly surprised how enjoyable each episode has been and how I grown to care for the characters, especially Chummy, my favorite."
1,Disappointed in the come-on,"Don't get me wrong--I thought the first episode was wonderful. But what peeves me is that I pay monthly for prime video, and then they throw out the bait with one episode and expect you to pay for all the rest. Makes me very angry. I couldn't find any other place to express my frustration and anger, so I am doing so here. Think that is very poorly thought out and makes me think whether it is worth keeping prime video. Turned me sour on the whole thing."
3,Slow but interesting,"First the bad news: This was VERY SLOW to download, although film quality was mostly OK. HD not needed, I recommend getting just the SD version. This is not an exciting series, doesn't have a lot of action, subject matter may not be of interest to the average personThe good: This has the feel of a series that can grow on you. The characters are interesting enough that there is hope they will be better developed with time.Bottom line: I'm not sure I'll look at the next installment."
5,Stunning stories,A brilliant series. I feared it might be mamby-pamby but was delightfully pleased at how raw and real it was.
5,Call the Midwife,I am really glad I purchased this. Show has rave reviews and much easier to have it all in one place instead of taping it each week.
5,Call the midwives,Loved this show! Great writing with a lot of heart. I find myself anxiously waiting for season two to begin.
5,Love this show and so ready for season two to show on TV,OMG we had caught one of the episodes on TV and missed the rest. This is a brilliant show and I can hardly wait for the next season to come out. It got max ratings when it aired on British TV.
5,Well Done,"Engaging characters, clever plot, and a period piece to boot, this show drew me in and held my attention. The scenes have wonderful authenticity. The dialog is crisp , sometimes funny, sometimes deeply moving. The series portrays a time that seems at once not long ago, yet impossibly remote. Nurse midwifes working in a poor neighborhood witness and participate in important vignettes of the human condition now relegated to hospitals.There is a vital grittiness that rings of clear headed perception by the writer and producers, with scenarios at once familiar and unfamiliar, knit together with wit timing and heart."
5,Excellent show!,"I am a midwife so everyone has recommended I watch this show. I have enjoyed the story lines and the development of the characters. While the babies aren't very ""newborn"" looking, the spirit of the work these young women are engaged in is true to form!"
5,Wonderful series - sad time in that neighborhood.,"You've started - now you must go to season 2. Read all the books, too. Can't wait for season 2. (and book 3)"
5,Evocative series,"Late 1950s England, the creation and nurturing of life, great music, great drama, great acting, a touch of humor -- could not be better!"
3,A Bit Too Graphic for Me and My Husband,"The writing is good, but the physical details in the scenes portraying childbirth were too graphic for us. The story line was interesting, though."
2,Probably OK For Some...,I bought this season for my daughter as a gift. After watching the first two episodes we both agreed that there was little to be entertained about women screaming their heads off during childbirth. Meh...just not our kind of movie.
2,"Great show, but doesn't work","I enjoy the show when I saw this on PBS. I had hoped to watch it many more times but only the first episode seems to work. I suggest watching, just not here.Update: this show still does not work. The good ratings are quite misleading since they do not review the PRODUCT, but review the show."
1,Call the Midwife,I ordered Call the Midwife and I couldn't play the non-usa format. I returned it and ordered the dvd I could play
1,What the????,The first episode did nothing for me. I think my expectations for British period pieces is too high after watching Downton Abbey which I absolutely LOVE>
1,no video,"audio plays, but no video :(this is the second time i've had major problems viewing this series on amazon.what gives?"
4,Call the Midwife,"Watched at the recommendation of a nurse friend. As a history buff,good narration and depiction of the era. Not overplayed drama."
4,Fascinating look into a time and place ot often seen.,"Was astonished at the conditions in an advanced country such as England during that time frame. And the brave women, both the nurses, nuns and the mothers portraryed in this eye opening series. Believe that it would be of interest to all thinking women, regardless of age or circumstances."
5,loved it,loved it and can not wait to watch season 2 and getr into the 3rd season. everyone who likes this type of show shoule watch . Maggie Smith is a great actress.
5,Catch up on past episodes,Stay in the story line by viewing past episodes. The new season starts on PBS this spring. Don't miss it.
5,Delightful,"As with many British series, this one has just the right mix of real life drama and fun. It's very easy to get caught up in the lives of the characters - laugh with them and cry with them. Some of the issues dealt with may not be for the faint hearted. The time period was a time of change, both in medicine and in living conditions. And the show, unlike several popular shows right now - deals with people struggling to survive, and feed themselves and their families. No staff to wait on them.It helps to remember how far we've come in a short span of time, and to see the 'opther side' of life during this time period.I highly recommend this series and look forward to another season."
1,"So, it's not just me.",I've watched many tv episodes and movies on amazon and have never had this happen. I sent them a notice via feedback. Hope they answer back.
1,BBC film fan thumbs down on this one,"I love good BBC vids. State of Play---Brilliant! Downton Abbey---marvelous! But the first 20 minutes of this one didn't grab me so I bailed. Maybe it got better or maybe not, but what I don't get is why would a film maker waste the first 20 minutes my failing to present a character with which the viewer can empathize? It's like going on a first date in your sweats."
5,good,"I watched this for $1.99 on Amazon on my desktop computer. I had recorded it but the voice didn't record for some reason. This helped me keep up with the series, which is really good!"
5,A unique show,Very entertaining!I was quickly absorbed into the lives of the characters and how it was to live in 1960's poverty stricken London.
5,So Authentic and Original!,"If you have not watched this yet, you are truly missing out. The series is so well done I have to remind myself it was created NOW. It is set in the 50s and full of drama. The midwives cater to the lower middle class in the poorest areas of London's East End with woman having babies in sometimes the most deplorable situations. The acting is incredible and while I do have my favorite characters there isn't a single actor/actress on this show that isn't wonderful. Even if you feel this is not sometimes you will enjoy, give it a try you may be very surprised. I have laughed and cried in almost every episode. Only on episode 6 Season 1 but will continue to watch until!"
5,Rate this with 4 stars,As with all BBC products this was great -- was a little concerned with the title but the actors are great and story is enjoyable
3,Good Historical Show,So far I have watched one episode and I really can't wait to see the other 5. I believe the show to be historically accurate.
4,Women at Work!,"Captures a time post WWII in England that is interesting, and buoyant as people get back to their lives, and looking at how these special women contributed. Wish there were more. Just beginning to get really involved in their stories."
5,Excellent drama,I just loved it. Probably the best drama I have seen in 2012. The acting is phenomenal and the storytelling is just superb. Don't think twice about purchasing this amazing series.
4,Great Show,I was so happy to find this. I missed it on PBS. Wonderful program. If you like this also try London Hospital. That one is free with your Prime membership.
3,Looking 4 More,"I purchased this book a couple of years ago, it's ok, but looking for more as a beginner. The book held my attention for a short time. Looking for a better ""beginner"" book."
4,Good read,This has definitely helped me choose some solid stocks and to utilize my brokerage account more efficiently. Very easy to understand.
2,Pricey & bad fit,"Needed one quick, so went online, the price was comparable with others but the S&H was outrageous. The lid is very hard to get on and off, does not fit well. With their outlandish S&H charges, I would not buy from that company again."
1,Vatican Missing,You want a review? I will be glad to do this WHEN and ONLY when the ENTIRE 7th season is released. The Vatican episode is MIA on this version. Shame on ST/CBS/P&T!
1,"""Right to Free Speech""?","The DVD cover that contains the words ""Right to Free Spech"" while at the same time it lacks the Vatican episode. I can only hope Penn & Teller were dissatisfied with the quality of the episode as opposed to Showtime censoring the release. Very disappointed."
2,"""Complete"" my fat backside...","There were a lot of wonderful topics covered in Season 7 of this fine show that Amazon is content to sell but will not name fully. The astrology and organic foods episodes were spectacular! There was all the humor, the criticism and intelligence I've come to expect from this fine program.You know what else was spectacular? The Vatican episode. Rather like the ""200"" and ""201"" episodes of ""South Park"" the powers that be, in this case the same parent company, if I recall correctly, are content to remove this episode from history. It is not on this DVD, and it is no longer listed on the site for the show.Due to this I shall sadly not be buying this season on DVD. That's what torrents are for. I'll be happy to buy other seasons that aren't butchered and when Showtime puts this episode back into circulation on a DVD set, I'll buy it. But until then? No. Sorry, guys. It's a great show, but I will not accept buying an incomplete complete season."
1,Whiskey Tango Foxtrot - This is B.S.!!!,"Say it ain't so - the brash, invincible, self-proclaimed vanguards of free speech so emphatically emasculated by the Vatican?! Now that's B.S.!!! I truly expected more from Penn & Teller and the creative team at B.S. - if you're gonna bow to censorship, then I suggest you scrap your entire show or at the very least, refuse to release the dvd set in its current INCOMPLETE form. There's a word you may be familiar with: ""integrity"" - I believe it is the platform upon which your entire emmy-nominated series was founded. Or was it all just B.S.?!"
1,deceptive advertising,"Despite what the box says, this isn't the complete season.It is missing the season finale."
3,"Worth it for the ""Full House"" of Horror Stars Factor","""The Black Sleep"" has just about every one of the 1st generation of classic horror stars in it, a kind of ""last hurrah"" for some of them, before Hammer Studios reinvented the genre with Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing (2nd generation). The plot, such as it is, moves along. Some nice icky poking around in brains shots. Basil Rathbone remains professional despite the material and gives an excellent, sharp performance as always. But it is John Carradine who steals the show.The Lon Chaney Jr. character Mongo was recycled in Mel Brook's ""Blazing Saddles"". I didn't get the reference until I saw this film.""The Black Sleep"" is classic, campy, B&W; gothic horror from the 50s. Worthwhile."
2,There has to be a better guide out there,"After seeing the five-star review for a previous edition of this book I was eager to buy it for my recent trip to Mexico City. Sadly, it fell far short of my expectations. For starters, the maps are woefully inadequate. There aren't enough of them, they lack sufficient detail, and there is no number and letter grid system. That last problem is inexcusable and made it nearly impossible to find many of the sights mentioned in the book. The overall organization of the book is also not done well and does not seem very logical. Making matters worse, the book is not bound well and actually started to lose pages before my relatively short trip even ended. I have had far better books than this when I have visited other parts of the world. I have to think someone makes a better Mexico City guide too."
4,Very happy with this guide book,"Although this book is now almost 4 years old, it is still the best Mexico City-only guide I could find. The text information on sites, restaurants, hotels, etc. is generally excellent, and held up well during my recent trip to Mexico City. Some of the maps and graphics could be updated, but generally I found this to be a reliable, entertaining and useful book. I'd recommend it to anyone planning a trip to Mexico City unless and until something better comes along."
3,Not enough info if you plan to use the metro,"True, this book does have a lot of information about Mexico City. On that end, I was relatively pleased, however, this book does nothing other than give you a street address or intersection to help you find a destination. This book will not help you if you plan to walk and use the metro as the maps do not contain enough detail for you to plan your route from metro station to your desired destination. Thankfully I had Let's Go Mexico. While Let's Go did not have near the detail of Moon's Mexico City (it is, after all, a book on the entire country), it would list the nearest metro station along with the address of the destination. On a different note, I was disappointed that this book did not warn me about choosing Sunday as a day to shop at the artisan markets. Those markets that this book pointed out were open on Sunday had a reduced selection and many closed stalls."
3,Not what I expected...,"The product was absolutely not what I expected. I believed it was a small bag for the camera. Maybe my fault. Just for you to know, it's a rather big bag for at least 2 cameras and accessorie. What can I say... I don't use it."
4,Nice case for long trips,"Nice price for a case that is best for camera storage and long trips. Not small enough for taking snapshots at, say, sporting events."
2,Too much of a good thing.,"If you are looking for a compact carrier for your camera, avoid this item like the plague.If you are looking for a carrier for a photo day trip this will hold your camera in addition to a small tripod, other accessories and maybe your lunch.In fact, I would recommend it for anyone who carries a purse or bag and wants to carry one tote without the need for two or three."
4,I like my camera,I am a point and shoot person so I have not attempted to use any manual settings. I am getting great photos using the auto setting or one of the other theme type settings. The battery life is very good. I'm having fun with it! I recently returned from Florida where I found my one unfavorable point. In bright sunlight I cannot see what I'm trying to take a picture of. It does not have a viewfinder so you must rely on the screen to line up your photo. All in all it's a great little camera.
4,Fresh sound,"I've had the Lina CD for a while. There are hits and misses, but overall, it's a nice CD. I enjoy her high-pitched voice and I really like how she blends old and new styles. I wish there weren't different CDs for the UK and for the US!My favorites: Playa No Mo, Stranger on Earth and the untitled ""Doodling"" song."
5,Good stuff...,"i first heard ""i'm not the enemey"" while watching the movie High Crimes. i absolutely love the song and when it was over i found it on the internet and downloaded it. it's definitely a great song, mainly because it is so unique. it's got a vintage jazz sound combined with new age hip hop. it's really awesome and i suggest you give it a try."
5,Too Good To Be True!,"I was in Tower records one day not really looking for any cd in particular just passing time before a movie. I was intrigued by the cover purchased the cd and my life has never been the same. I went back to purchased another one...because i was afraid to take it out of my car cd changer,I didn't want to forget and leave it in the house and vice versa. This album ""Stranger on Earth"" is hands down the most incredible album I have ever heard. It's everything good music should be, she's beautiful and her voice is beautiful, great lyrics! great music! It's too good to be true! It's a life changer she's gonna be big!!!!"
5,If You Want The Same Old Stuff... Don't Buy This!,"Wow!! This CD is totally different than anything I have ever heard before! I am a huge music fan, and I've heard it all, and this is by far the most unique album I think i've heard in a very long time! I first heard of Lina when I took a little trip to Europe back in February 2001, her album and single ""Playa No Mo"" had just come out. I bought the single, and immediately fell in love! I am so happy the album finally got released in the USA, with a few new tracks. Do not overlook this album, it is a burst of fresh air in the music world. LINA also cowrote and coproduced EVERY song on this CD, with the exception of one track! Now that's pure talent! Her voice also has great range and is very unique, but not too unique. Check this out, you won't be disapointed! PS: Listen for the hidden bonus tracks, very cool!"
2,Wrong Formula.,"Ok, the girl can sing, right, but why in the world would youresort to an album with digital plastic sounding drums?There lays the problem in this album.Next time Lina, if there is one, get a live band.This is better than Blu Cantrall, but that is not saying much though."
3,Stranger on Earth,"She has a lot of different styles, the beginning of the CD sounds like Josphine Baker, she goes into some Erykah Badu, Janet Jackson and a few others. Her sound is interesting."
4,This CD has a lot of good moments..............,"Like other reviewers have written, my first taste of Lina was from mixtapes and CD samples from friends from I have in the UK ,but the songs I heard were not on the CD. Not that the songs I heard were the best, just her over all style is what made me go out and buy the US version. The track ""Bye-Bye Baby"" has my ears wide open to this tight groove, but over all the entire CD sounds too ""50's"" to me and I'm sorry, but I'm not a fan of that era of music. Other tracks I like are ""It's Alright"" and ""Waiting"". ""I'm Not The Enemy"" has it's moments and one of the tracks I heard from earlier recordings is featured as a hidden track but remixed. One thing I can guarentee about this CD is that nothing in your collection sounds anything like it..."
3,Should have been an 8 song ep,"3 1/2Often overlooked (like most Naked City albums after their legendary self-titled) follow up is not to be overlooked by fans of Zorn and company's Classical side, despite shady repetitions of material. Tacking on a heaping pile of schizophrenic mini-blasts taken straight from Torture Garden sessions might not have been smart, but contrasting that latter half with some of the band's more subtle, pretty instrumentation in covering several composers is. Of course your epic lead-off track specializing in measured bursts of musical irrationality, which happens to be these artist's forte, does not hurt either."
4,"Not the best, but some very good stuff here","I've got about 30 Zorn albums, and love his many different sides. Grand Guignol comprises two collections--the Torture Garden sections (the later, short pieces) don't generally do much for me; too much grindcore and not enough of the more interesting pieces a la the first awesome Naked City album.However, the first part of the disk, with the slower and dark pieces, is very nice.All in all, this isn't on my must-have Zorn list, but if you're into the hardcore short punk stuff as well as the darker softer stuff, go for it."
3,It was good but no keeper,"Every Kind Of Heaven written by Bethany Campbell was good and is about the romance of a guy named Pearce Goddard and a lady named Mollie Randall, it wasn't my favorite Bethany Campbell book but it was an enjoyable read though I just didn't find it to be a keeper as It just didn't totally wow me!"
3,The battery terminal width is narrower than true RBC5,"The battery terminal width is 0.187"" when currect APC RBC5 terminal width is 0.25"".The difference resulted in somewhat sloppy terminal connection to UPS. Although it works, I don't think it is durable in vibrating environment.The vendor did not mention about terminal width in the item description. But when they claim it is RBC5 compatible, it should be compatible to the terminal width.Other than the terminal size, the battery is healthy and good. the size matches RBC5 well, too."
4,Please buy it...,"...or at least view it. I recently saw this film on the International channel and was endlessly pleased with it. Set in Korea in the past, a group of royalty must flee for their lives through a gate that transports its users into the future. However, even a time jump doesn't keep them safe as they are closely pursued by assassins. the plot thickens when several modern day people are inadvertently brought into the struggles.It has time travel, sword fights, love, honor, duty, etc., everything that is needed to make a really nifty movie. Even the music is good, with the more traditional lilting flute type of melody in the bits that take place in the past, and some death metal type music and other stuff in the scenes that take place in the present day. I truly enjoyed it and the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five was because it was a bit difficult to follow at times. Share and enjoy."
1,Not real hillsides,This book did not have any plans that were truely on a hillside. There were not enough options available. I will be doing my research on line in the future.
3,Hillside Homes: 208 Sloping-Lot & Multi-Level Designs,"I was disappointed in the book because it did not include some designs of ""Drive-Under"" garage on the rear of the house. There were plenty of ""garages-On-The-End"" designs. I want a split level plan with ground-level entrance from the front to the top (ground)level and a driveway leading to the rear with a drive-under or garage with storage, etc and stairs leading to the top level. I would appreciate some suggestions if you know of a book that includes such. My email address is jbjact@juno.com. Home to be built on a 15 to 25 degree slope-to-the-rear terrain in Alabama."
5,How to Survive Getting Into College,How to Survive Getting Into College is an amazing resource for high school students wanting advice from their peers on the college application process. A must read for any high school student needing advice on where to start and what to do to prepare for this tedious process!
1,Disappointed,"When I chose this book among the hudreds available, I expected some well explained advice. Instead what I got is a book filled with one paragraph comments. It might have a couple of good ideas but not what I expected it to be."
5,Excellent Resource!,"As someone who works with young adults applying to college, I cannot recommend this book highly enough!"
4,All hail the conquering instro!,"This is another package of 30 great instrumentals from the ""hey day"" of rock'n roll. The Fireballs, The Ventures, The Wailers, Phil Upchurch, Duane Eddy, The Ramrods and even Jimmy Dorsey's Orchestra....This is a great package that brings back the years 1956 thru 1964 and 30 of the greatest instrumentals of that pre-Beatle era. Lee Allen and ""Walkin' with Mr. Lee"" re-mastered with sound that is fabulous. The Wailers and ""Mau Mau"" is wonderful!!! The only draw back in the package is that ""Wipe Out"" by The Surfaris and ""Woo Hoo"" by The Rock-a-teens are Mono and available elsewhere in stereo. All in all, this is a great package."
2,Correction about publication,"NOTE: Despite this being listed as a book or chapbook, it is actually a note on three letters from Tolkien to John Masefield (one letter) and to Terence Tiller (two letters) published in Mythlore (the journal of The Mythopoeic Society) 7.2 (whole # 24) (1980): 8."
3,Not bad,"As a former Leatherneck myself, I found this book to be O.K....but maybe only because I can relate. Nothing terrible, but nothing great either. If you're looking for an action packed story of long range kills and adventure, this is not it."
5,From a combat veteran,"Anyone who believes the stories of long range shots and assinations by snipers knows nothing about the real Vietnam War. All snipers operated with infantry units in 1966-67. Anyone who ventured out alone never went home alive. Grow up and smell the coffee - Vietnam was an infantry war. Culbertson wrote an accurate portrayal, without trumped up ""war stories""."
2,A Marines review,"I found the book ""A Sniper In The Arizona"" interesting ONLY because I served in An Hoa Vietnam the same time that John was with Hotel 2/5. I served with the 2nd Bn, 11th Marines, Echo Battery in support of his company during the attack on Nong Son Mountain.I was disappointed in the fact that the book had very little to do about sniping. A lot of the focus of the book seemed to be on Operation Tuscaloosa. There was only one sniping story in the book, and the book seemed to focus more on daily patrols.It seemed to me that the author was having a hard time filling pages with interesting content."
5,John Lafley's review I was there,This book is a true account of days spent in the Arizona. It also flashes back to acounts of some time spent at the DMZ.H 2/5 Marines Tales of daily battles with Victor Charlie John's Tells it like it was back then. Watching out for booby traps such as trip wires pungietraps and other explosive devices Charlie put out there to kill or dissable The American fighting marine.The men who fought Were true warriors of the time.This is a great part of Viet Nam History.A must read for any Marine going into battle. Semper Fi Thanks to Charlie Mexico For teaching me how to stay alive in the bush.Great job John !!!
2,Where's the sniping?,"This is an okay book if you want to read about a typical grunt's tour in Vietnam, but the title is very missleading. It seems like left-overs from Culbertson's first book OPERATION TUSCALOOSA."
1,Is this leftovers?,"It would appear tha John Culbertson picked up the scraps on the cutting floor left over from his first book,Tuscaloosa and tried in vain to make some kind of sniping book. It has so little about sniping that the title should be changed. Very dissapointing!"
3,Not Really a Sniper Book,Good account of Marine combat in Vietnam. Title of book is misleading however. Culbertson goes to Sniper School but does not do any sniping when he gets back to his grunt unit. He merely continues patrolling and getting into firefights with the VC and later the NVA. Good action and worth the read but not about long-range sniping from a hiding place.
2,Misleading book title,This is NOT a book about Sniping. It is about an everyday Grunt Marine in Vietnam who has been to sniper school. The title of this book is very misleading. I did not consider this book a good read. He may be a war hero. In my opinion he is not a writer.
2,A sniper in the Arizona by John J Culbertson,"Pretty good book but with a misleading title. True Mr Culbertson was a trained sniper, but there is maybe one or two chapters in the whole book that deals with snipers. Mostly it's a book about marines fighting in the arizona territory, not about snipers or sniping. Don't get me wrong, I like reading about marines and enjoyed mr. Culbertsons book on operation Tuscaloosa, but, when I want to read about snipers I don't like being decieved by a title that says snipers but means a marine, who just happens to be trained as a sniper, fighting with a company of marines."
3,A Sniper in the Arizona,"A good book, but not about Snipers. A more appropriate title, ""Grunts in the Arizona."""
3,Lack of complete information.,"Mr. Culbertson seems to have been in a slightly different war than some of us were in at An Hoa. Most of his geographical info is highly correct. My main concern is the final chapter of his book about USMC Operation Union II. I do not understand how he says that Hotel Co. 2/5 was the Sparrow Hawk for Fox Co. 2/5 on June 2, 1967. I was there and I have photos . Echo Co. 2/5 was the sparrow Hawk that went to save Fox Co., to no avail, it was too late. That night is the nightmare of my life. I will gladly share this info with any other concerned parties. Also, Capt. Graham won the MOH trying to save wounded Marines, not while manning an M60 machine gun. SEMPER FI."
1,"A ""Sniper? "" In The Arizona","The Title of the book is very misleading. I bought the book because I have an interest in the art of sniping and was hoping to read about a snipers exploits in vietnam. This book has nothing to do with sniping. Instead, it is the story of a marine grunt on the front lines of battle. Even though the author was trained as a marine corps scout/sniper, he never did any sniping in vietnam. Mr. Culbertson was an expert marksman, but he isn't worth a dime as a writer. The book was very disappointing. I would suggest that you look elsewhere for sniping action."
2,Board broken after 9 mos,"We chose the Sony on the basis of a strong rating in Consumer Reports and their reputation as a solid brand. Picture and features are nice, but I'm disappointed to report that after only 9 months the TV's board has failed and the warranty for labor is only 90 days! Fortunately, the parts warranty is 12 months so the board is covered but we will still be paying about $170 in labor to get the TV fixed.Given the weight of this unit (no fun to get to an upstairs game room!) and the price of plasma screens continuing to fall, I would not opt for this model but rather a plasma TV that you now don't have to pay that much more for and won't break your back moving around. And, based on our experience, I would not pay extra $$ for the Sony brand."
3,Didn't last long,"I know this is naive in today's disposable mkt, but I really expected this tv to last longer than not-quite six years. Have to say that it was good while it lasted, but in order to reach the back my husband had to build a wooden sled to slide it out of place for access. The weight is unbelievably high. The red color became faded after five years, but I trudged on, seeing orange for several more months, but now the picture is gone. Bought a new tv, but this one is so heavy that disposing of it presents a major problem. I think it would make a good mooring, but if I can get 2 more people to help me I'll probably use it to shore up my embankment & cover it w/mulch & dirt. No way we can lift it onto a truck."
4,Great Television with a lot of features,"I bought this TV to replace a JVC 37 inch model that lasted 15 years. The ONLY negative I can say is that the width is taken up by the speakers, so if you have a limited space, this will fall on the short side of filling the hole...nothing a wooden valance (vertical blind variety or ???) can't take care of!"
1,Unacceptable Service Life for Premium TV,"7 years ago we treated ourselves to our first (and last) Sony TV. For these 7 years it has been a great tv. Then it would come on and immediately go off. The website indicated that the flashing light on the front may require service but there was some sequences to try to maybe correct the problem. When this did not work I ""Chatted"" with a technician who finally concluded that the tv required hands on service. This 165# monster requires in home service which I concluded would probably be ~$200+ especially since we live in ""The Country"". So with some effort the tv went to recycle and we now have a new TV.The big issue is why would I ever spend the 1.5 to 2 times the cost over the excellant Vizio replacement for a Sony??????"
1,Always 16x9 mode in 4x3 set,"When the TV is on, it is always 16x9 screen. After you zoom it to full screen, image clarity suffers. To be worse, about 25% of the screen on both sides is cut off leaving 5 day weather forcast to 4 days. What is Sony thinking? Forcing people to buy 34hs420 for $500 more?"
4,Nice but clearly a knockoff of a quality lamp,"Nice shade, sturdy base, finial is cheesey plastic. Overall a good value but don't expect high quality, it is of decent quality."
2,"it's a journal, not a book",there are so many other books that cover this topic in a more enjoyable and comprehensive way. not recommended.
5,Amazing,Without a doubt my favorite Naked City CD. Saw them live around the time this Cd was recorded.Trulying amazing. They were reading off of sheet music!
5,"Don't think, buy it!",An excellent book for people who want to have a general knowledge of most of the advanced topics in Java2. Each topic was covered to a reasonable good depth. I would recommend highly to those who are thinking of taking the Sun Java Developper exam. Go buy it now!
2,"Decent overview, but no depth","This is a decent overview of the topics covered, but goes into very little depth. Not enough depth to seriously develop using any of the topics. I use this as an occasional reference book, but don't rely on it as a guide. I also found the explanations and organization inferior. Many of the same topics are covered in about the same detail, but in a much better organized manner by Bruce Eckel's Thinking in Java."
2,Old wine in new bottle?,"I bought this book thinking that there will be a lot of new stuff as compared to the previous version - Core Java 1.1 Advanced features. Although a couple of new chapters have been added, the book basically presents the material and examples from the previous edition wrapped with ""Swing"" wherever applicable. If you already have a copy of Core Java 1.1 advanced edition and you been curious to visit the Sun's Java tutorial Web site for Swing and Java 2D examples, it is really not worthwhile buying this ""Swing"" wrapped edition.Plus, with books available in today's market that exclusively cover each of the topics presented in this book, I wonder what is it that is ""advanced"" one would learn from this book."
2,"Gives a glimpse of all the ""advanced"" topics","The authors make this book appear as an extension to Java tutorial available on the web. The depth of coverage is just enough to understand the basic concepts of the ""advanced"" topics.But as a whole, it is a good book to understand the fundamentals of topics like JDBC, RMI, (a little bit of CORBA-idl), and Java 2 security."
4,Said the sound of the spectacle.,"This is really a great gateway riot grrrl album. It dabs in some of the greatest Bikini Kill songs there are. The best, ""New Radio"" and ""Rebel Girl"" are the first two and it varies from then on out, but there were a few missing from the collection, like ""Suck My Left One"" and ""Bloody Ice Cream"", ect. But essentially, if you're new to Bikini Kill, this is a good investment of all the aray of stuff they can do. Definately not their best, but definately some of their best. Awesome."
2,Great Idea - Not So Great Execution,"I needed a new power adapter for my Powerbook, so this seemed like a great idea. For for a little bit more than Apple's AC adapter I could get AC and DC with connections for auto and airplanes.The only problem is, it doesn't work very well. The Smarttip connector for the Powerbook will not keep a connection. I continually have to check the power indicator on my Powerbook and twisting the connector to make sure the battery is being charged.Kensington also seems to have fudged on the power specification. They claim 70 watts, but the Powerbook's System Profiler reports 45 watts. This means that the battery takes much longer to charge than Apples adapter. In fact, while I am using it, it barely charges at all. If I set the Powerbook down, likely as not the Smarttip loses its connection and I come back to a dead battery.So, there's a great idea here. Perhaps someday, someone will implement it in a competent way."
3,about traditional thai masage,"I would like to know about Thai massage , how come , the benefit, history, how to massage and more imformation"
1,Don't waste your money,I purchased this item expecting to be able to use it on a job that required pre-hanging a houseful of doors. I was very disappointed. It would not perform even to minimum standards and I had to purchase a different brand of jig in order to complete the job. The plastic houseing was of very poor quality. I would recommend anyone considering this item to re-think their purchase.
1,Very Dissapointing,"I bought this jig for my carpenters to install locks, assuming a Porter Cable jig would be of good quality. When I opened the box, I laughed to discover the plastic housing. The drill fit very poorly, did not spin freely, and did not fit through the hole on the other side of the jig without manipulating it. Tried the quick release and could not get it to disengage without a pair of pliers.Just to see, I gave it to my lead carpenter and without my saying anything, he laughed too. Mr. Pike's review is from 1999 when, I believe, the jig was metal not plastic. It's shocking to me that a company that presents itself as selling tools to professionals would ever present such a low class toy. Thank you Amazon for taking it back, I could not risk even trying it on one door."
2,They should have stayed with metal,"I bought this to finish some custom built 2+"" thick alder doors. I nearly ruined one of them account this plastic piece of crap is unstable. It allows the shank of the bit to wander and thus the hole comes out crooked. There is just too much load on the large hole bit for the integrity of the plastic jig frame. The bolt feed is aggressive and may cause the feed point to get into widows cut into the door. I am totally unhappy with this product. It might work fine on hollow core or softwood doors. I will go back to using a General drill guide to drill a 1/4"" pilot hole through the door and follow that with the common hole saw."
2,"Great idea, poor execution","Sorry P-C, I can't give you the five stars.The third time I used this kit, the 2 1/8"" bit bound in the door and the plastic arms that hold the guide bushing snapped right off. Fortunately I was able to exchange for a new one. The jig really needs to be solid metal, not plastic.The 1"" bit is a self-feeding auger bit - works great! The 2 1/8"" bit unfortunately is not. I had to put a LOT of pressure on the bit to get it to work. For the price, I was expecting a self-feeding 2 1/8"" bit.If they could fix these two major flaws, I would give it 5 stars. As I said in the title, this is a great idea with poor execution."
3,Take a look at the Classic Engineering 10800.,I have about 30 doors to hang. I bought the Classic Engineering 10800 and the Porter Cable 511. I received the Classic first and gave it a test drive through some scrap. It work so well that I never even needed to open the box of the Porter Cable and sent the PC packing.
3,Shame on Porter Cable,"I bought this because looking at the picture it looked like a well made system. The discription said nothing about plastic parts. And like one of the other reveiwers said the auger bit is a much to strong. Using a forsner bit works much better. Porter cable is a good name, but shame on you Porter for using such cheap material on the heart of the unit, (the jig itself)"
1,Buy the Templaco Jig Instead. This is not a very good tool.,I used the Porter Cable jig 10-15 times before it started falling apart. Not long after that it was useless. I probably could repair it but for the money it should work flawlessly for a long time. A great idea that was executed badly. It is not worth the money when you can get the Templaco jig for $100 more. I use many Porter Cable tools and can only say good things about them. I don't understand why they allow a tool of such poor quality to have their name on it.Buy the Templaco jig instead. It gives you a lot more bang for the buck. Once you're spending almost $300 for a tool you might as well spend the extra $100 and get something that really works.
1,Dissapointing.,"My gut told me not to buy this after reading some less than stellar reviews. Well, I did it any way and I regret it. The jig is flimsy, which makes it hard to drill a straight hole. The 1"" auger bit is WAY TO AGGRESSIVE! I'm not trying to hog through studs, here! After making my drill smoke, I switched over to a spade bit to finish the job. My ""quick change"" drill adapter wasn't quick. I could not get it to release the bit without beating on it with a hammer.There is not one good part in this kit, nor is there one good thing to say about this kit. I think I'll be putting this up on eBay and step up to the Classic Engineering. I'm a big PC fan and I feel this is a huge let down."
3,porter cable lock boring kit,"Plastic molded frame with brass bushing does hold well to door. the drill bits are ok.The striker plate stamp and other stamps are not sharp so they crush styles of the door. This jig good for occational use but not for production work, I don't feel the frame will last more than 50 or so bores."
2,save your money if you plan to use it much.,"I looked at this and had to pass. It is not well made. It has way too much plastic in it. I waited a little longer and got a TEMPLACO Bore Master BJ115. I only payed $270.00 on Ebay. It is made for commercial use. It also will cut cleaner wholes and is more versatile. If you have a good router it has gigs to make the latch and strike plates cuts. It appears the Porter Cable doesn't include the smaller bit used for deadbolts. The Templaco also uses spur bits instead of whole saw bits or flat bits. The only thing I will add is a 7/8"" bit for use on some locks. I have never heard a bad word about the Templaco's. For a few dollars more you can get a much better product and more importantly do a better job. I do not want to use a piece of junk and mess up an expensive door or have to hang a new door for that matter. Like they say you are only as good as your tools. You get what you pay for."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING PRODUCT,"I bought this jig to bore the passage sets on 9 doors for a job I was on. I've always depended on Porter Cable to supply me with pro quality tools. This is not even close to home owner quality. The supplied 2&1/8"" forstner bit had almost no clearance ground onto the cutter. The result? Like trying to cut your way through a 2x4 with a butter knife! I had to hand file it on the job in order to even use it. The 1"" self feed bit boring worked better, but is VERY aggressive. The self centering guide that it fits into doesn't center the bit, and won't necessarily guide it correctly either. I had one door I almost blew through the stile into a door panel because it went off at an angle. It was a very UNSATISFYING tool purchase, and very frustrating to use. When I pay this much for a tool, I expect it to work as advertised out of the box. The PC 511 doesn't deliver what it advertises."
3,"Not Great, But Okay.","In China Flyer, the third of the Bombay Marine books, the hero and his crew go to China. Lacks the in depth sailing details of O'Brien, but that was okay with me; also lacked the character depth of C. S. Forrester, and that hurt. The characters are a bit two dimensional, and historical anachronisms occur. Still, if you aren't too knowledgable about the precise details of eighteenth century sailing and are looking for a decent read, this is good. It's the sort of book you'd take to the beach."
2,Forgettable,"The cover of this book compares it to the Horatio Hornblower series, but alas the book doesn't measure up. It is a potboiler adventure set the Far East in the late 1700s. The characters are flat, and because the author spends so much time shifting viewpoints between so many different characters, none except the hero achieve much actual depth. The plot isn't that interesting or exciting. This was the first of the series I'd read, and I won't be picking up any others. Not awful, but not the best--Not even average."
2,Great match. Awful video transfer.,"I consider this the best tennis match in history.However, this DVD is pretty much unwatchable on HDTVs due to the poor video transfer. Standard resolution and lots of flicker. I had to switch to a small computer monitor to watch beyond Fed's opening service game.I will keep but only because I accidentally deleted the ""live"" HD version that I recorded on my PCTV.[note: I wish it were a tv or blu ray player calibration issue, but it is not]"
3,Its Widescreen but the picture quality sucks,"How do you get a 3 star review with a 5 star game? Just use a standard def picture and get a ton of artifacts when you convert from PAL to NTSC. Great game, pity about the picture."
2,BS!!! I'm not paying for 1.33 ratio!,"This match was on NBC and NBC has been in HD for years now. The match was *presented* in HD, 16x9. So now that it's on DVD, it's presented in glorious.....Standard Definition 1.33. Pathetic! When will DVD companies finally wake up and realize that movies are no longer formatted to fit 4:3 screens anymore and neither should sporting events!The match itself was epic and should truly be savored, but to present it in this near antiquated format is a complete disservice to the match and it's memory. I recommend renting this. Don't buy it."
1,what's the point!,cd 1 will not even play except the introduction. best match ever with worst taping!!! really disappointed! so much for the best match ever.
1,Not So Hot,"This book didn't even come close to living up to it's claim of listing 36 of ""the best"" hot springs in Arizona; for one thing, there aren't that many. The first three listings say right in them that bathing or swimming is prohibited, hardly among what we'd call the best hot springs. One listing dried up half a century ago and there's been no soaking there since. Many typos or wrong words show poor proofreading and little attention to detail. We couldn't recommend this book to anyone. HOT SPRINGS & HOT POOLS OF THE SOUTHWEST by Gersh-Yound is much, much more accurate and is worth the price. Mr. Bischoff needs to check his facts before making claims. Caveat Emptor"
5,Age of Miracles,"I read this book a couple of years ago (when it was titled ""Age of Miracles"") and I liked it. I thought the plot was interesting and fresh. Considering some of the plots I've read in historical fiction, that alone would make it worthy. I was happy to see it re-released!"
2,HIGH MAINTENANCE,"I sell and repair tools all day long. This tool is over priced, and has many engineering faults. As with any air tool you need to lubricate it @ the end of every day. This model in particular. It is made of plastic. For the money and power I would go w/ a Ingersoll Rand model 231 or 231XP. If you have a few extra bucks and want more power go w/ the model 244. This tool is not worth this much money."
5,IR-2131 - Best buy at a great price point,"Truely a great piece of work. Lightweight with adjustable torque setting up to 450 ft-lbs in forward, unreal 600 ft-lbs max in reverse. Too cool! All this at a price less than some heavier and larger impact wrenches. Make sure you dial your air pressure to the recommended 90 psi before running it though, it'll spin way faster in reverse than you think!"
2,This candy taste too sour.,"And they used too much cooking oil on candy wrappers. Every time after I ate it, I had to go wash my hands. Too much trouble."
5,Timeless and Tasty,"This hardback/layflat copy of More With Less is a replacement for the torn and burned paperback in three pieces that we have used since 1982. This is the bible for those who buy whole foods in bulk, or grow their own. Really comforting to have a new copy sitting in the dining room between the Vegetarian Epicure and the New Moosewood. All of the advice and recipes may be available on the world wide web, but unlike the lovely anarchy of the web, the instructions in More With Less are time tested and true."
5,Simple and nutritious recipes,"Now in a 25th anniversary edition, More With Less: A World Community Cookbook by Doris Janzen Longacre is an outstanding cookbook compilation of recipes and suggestions by Mennonites. Featuring not only delicious preparations, but ways that one can eat healthier meals that take less of the world's limited food resources (not to mention the resources of one's own pocketbook). From High-Protein Pancakes or Waffles; to Fresh Broccoli With Mock Hollandaise; to Hinkelsteins (oat sticks), these simple and nutritious recipes can be made from basic ingredients with a minimum of waste make for economical and thoroughly enjoyable dining."
5,Bought this to replace my old tattered one from the 70's,"very excellent cookbook for hard times, great ideas for making more with less, info about nutrition that's invaluable--such as replacing meat with grains (rice, wheat, millet, oats) & legumes (beans, split peas, peanut butter) when meat is unavailable. Highly recommend for these hard times."
3,Interesting,"This book does indeed have some very good tips for cooking frugally and healthfully. However, some of the nutritional information is outdated. Some of the ethnic recipes are a little bland. Furthermore, I question the author's thesis that our overabundance of food somehow causes a lack of food in other countries. However, the bible references are great and the general idea of spending less on junk food so we can spend more on God's work is, well, Christian!"
3,Eat like Mid-Westerner anywhere in the world!,"I hate to be a spoiler here but, too often, this cookbook reduces all the sublelty out of potentially great recipes.But if you're big into the casserole scene, this cookbook might help you branch out a little."
2,Not what I thought,I was expecting something with satisfying economical recipes. I really couldn't find any that I would have used.
5,Great basic cookbook,One of my favorite cookbooks. It has a lot of different recipes and variations as well as basic cooking information. I love flipping through all of the tidbits and quotes. As an apartment dwelling college student a lot of the ideas for extending meals and the basic instructions are helpful (such as how to cook rice!). I would highly recommend this as a gift for a child going out on their own for the first time.
4,Excellent resource for cooking and more,"I got the ""More with Less"" Cookbook when it first came out years ago, but had lost it over the past few moves. I remembered a bread recipe from this book that I had really loved, so I searched and found that they had just updated this excellent book. I found the recipe, and the bread was as good as I remembered. However, I'd forgotten the other incredible resources in this cookbook... about nutrition, about eating responsibly as a citizen of the world, about being good stewards of the world's resources, about healthy eating... PLUS all the wonderful recipes that are in this book.I would recommend this highly!"
4,"Easy, useful, low cost recipes.","My mother-in-law gave me this cookbook, and it was a wonderful addition to my collection. It has great recipes I can make with ingredients I have on hand. The bread recipes are great (try the Dutch Apple Bread on page 81). The granola recipes are also very good. I love that many of the recipes can be made in many sizes (for a small number of portions or a larger quantity). My husband and I often make larger quantities and freeze portions to eat later. This is another way to reduce costs, since I can buy in bulk.This book supports current philosophies on simple living. It has many good ideas on how to cut that grocery bill without cutting flavor."
5,Pass it on to the next generation!,My sister gave me this cookbook in the early 1980's. I've used it over the years so often that it's literally falling apart! I ordered two copies for my daughters who are now in their 20's. It's as appropriate today as it was when it was first written because of the ever increasing need for simplicity and frugality in our lives.
4,Great Frugal Resource,"I think M-W-L was more revolutionary when it was first published, but it remains a great resource for anyone wanting to cook and eat more frugally. Other cookbooks might provide similar recipes, but M-W-L also contains much commentary and suggestions for general practices (in addition to great recipes)."
3,"Interesting, but not quite what I expected.","I don't hate this book, but it isn't quite what I was expecting or hoping for. It does have some information that is still valuable today; but most of it is fairly common knowledge today (such as eat whole grains instead of refined ones). I do like the emphasis on being more aware of what we eat and how much we eat. Still, I found the book rather boring and redundant, overall."
5,More With Less Cookbook (World Community Cookbook),My son and daughter-in-law received a copy of this cookbook at their wedding a few years ago. I've looked it over many times and really wanted a copy. I'm happy to say I just received mine and am ready to try it!
2,Disappointing,"This is a strange little book. I will say that is has some redeeming features: some good granola, bread and dessert recipes for people who are already confident in the kitchen. However, a number of the main dishes are just odd (beef heart, anyone?). The recipes are consistently loaded with unnecessary fat - cheese on the vegetables? ground beef in minestrone? more than one creamed chicken recipe? More importantly, this book didn't contribute much to the frugality of my kitchen. If you grew up in a moderately frugal home, you are already familiar with most of the the tips and dishes in this book. This book will help you if you are new to planning family meals -- otherwise, just stick with Joy of Cooking."
5,Great Basic Cookbook,"I bought this after finding recipes on a few blogs I read. It was so worth the money! I did find it an interesting read, too, but what I like best is all the very basic recipes it contained. We've made homemade ""Hamburger Helper"", found an easy replacement for cream of soups and ""Shake n Bake"", and made our own chocolate pudding. It's very empowering to discover you can make a lot of this boxed stuff yourself. Not only is it a lot healthier (and cheaper), but it tastes a LOT better, too."
3,Its okay but third disc will not play!,I love all the battle field series however the battle of Leyte gulf will not play very disappointed. If you have an interest in World War two the other battlefield series are a must buy.Personally my favorite is Battlefield Russia.
3,the series is great but the DVD is only fair,"I loved this series when it was on PBS in the late 90's. I used to live in a town where the town library has the whole collection of the original VHS tapes and I watched every episode the library had. I have been looking for the DVD for quite some time now and up until now only DVD released was Region 2 DVD. I was happy to see Amazon has this series of DVD and I ordered them right away. I still enjoy watching this program. However, this DVD is nothing more than the VHS transfer. The main menu lacks the chapter selection and it does not have CC which the VHS tape did. I wish the company had done a better job at creating DVD to an otherwise superb TV program."
2,Missing material-Buyer Beware,"I have loved everyone one of the Battlefield DVDs from this series. The only reason this review is a 2 out of 5 stars is because the second half (the conclusion segement) is missing from Disc One ""The Battle of Midway"". And it wasn't a error mechanically, the group putting this series together could not find the second part in any of the achieves/ This statement appears as I was watching the DVD. (I will then assume the Blu Ray pack is absent this hour as well.) Also, on the packing it has the wrong amount of show time because of the missing hour.If you don't mind missing the conclusion of one of the three stories, then buy this dvd. The qualitity is still there, just not all the material."
3,Battlefield Great Sea Battles of WWII,Was looking forward to the Bluray format but it is not up to par unfortunately. Nice documentary do not get me wrong but the picture quality is not what you'd expect from a bluray product. I am happy to have it in my War collection
3,One for the Collector,"More one for the collector, this collects 6 later A-sides, 9 B-sides, 3 tracks from Gary US Bonds first album, and 5 previously unreleased works, and provides ""a chance to experience the other side of Gary Anderson's unique vocal talent - the soulful ballads, R&B; belters and some delightful doo wop"", as the notes proclaim. There is much to enjoy, such as the Christmas novelty Call Me For Christmas and the singles What A Dream (an exuberant love song with a reference to the Mona Lisa), My Sweet Ruby Rose, and Oh Yeah! Oh Yeah! from 1964, credited to Gary US Bonds and the Stompers and meeting the British invasion head on with a Kinks-like guitar figure and ""Mersey"" sound.However it is the unreleased numbers that fascinate the most - a totally reworked version of Johnny Cash's I Walk The Line, an update of the Hoagy Carmichael standard The Nearness Of You and a duet with his wife, Laurie Cedeno Anderson, formerly of the Love Notes."
3,Beware,"Beware: Planet Earth-The Complete Series . . . is NOT . . Planet Earth-The Complete BBC Series. In my enthusiasm for a $30 Planet Earth 'Complete Series' set I overlooked this not-so-obvious difference and feel burned. My 1986 series looks and feels very dated tho I'm sure it was very fine for its time. In it the pacing is rushed, they have funny haircuts, primitive computers and talk about Skylab."
2,Planet Earth - Beware,"This is a case of buyer beware as there are so many variations of the documentary Planet Earth. This version is ok for the cost although it is a bit outdated due to it's publication release. What made me unhappy was that I was looking for the series that has Sigourney Weaver narrating for my wife as a present and this version was not it. Unfortunately no matter what research I did I was unable to pre-determine who the narrator was ahead of time, but the cost was not too high so I bought it anyway.If you are looking for a relatively inexpensive series with some great photography then I would recommend it. If you are looking for the latest scientific data then this is not it."
3,not as good as Idiot Flesh,"Looks like SGM are running out of steam. You can't really blame them though since Dan Rathbun and Nils Frykdahl already used their best ideas on the Idiot Flesh albums, ""Fancy"" in particular, so most everything on ""Of Natural History"" sounds like a tired rehash of past days - ""old things in new packages"" indeed; even Carla Kihlstedt is not safe from it (""What Shall We Do Without Us?"" = ""Patchen"" from her solo album). Too bad the irony struck this hard, so most of it remains overlong, repetitive regurgitating of underdeveloped ideas eventually crashing down in a wall of noise (esp. ""Freedom Club"" and ""Babydoctor"" suffer from that problem). There is still some worthy material though in the form of the first 3 tracks and ""Gunday's Child"" which slighty lift it above the mediocre."
1,loose sphinctered & over ambitious,"OK so the production values & musicianship are great - but this is like if Trey Parker wrote a rock opera without any jokes in it and decided to get the fat shouty one from Penn&Teller to be the lead singer & put him way too far up in the mix. This band love the shroud of mystery invoked by acts such as the sun city girls, secret chiefs 3, and caroliner - and so they write & sing really clumsy ""satirical"" lyrics where big business, capitalism etc is represented by a mythical demon / beasty and have some other painful conceits to boot. oh dear. save your pennies."
3,Overcooked intrigue,"More volatile and indulgent than their sharply perverse debut, ONH still has enough fractured dazzle to spellbind the morbidly progressive set, but exemplifies the over-stretch with a lumbering second half."
4,Marguerite:Message of Merciful Love to Little Souls,This book is full of blessings. One cannot read it all at once because it commands meditation as each section is read. I am enjoying the reading and the messages Marguerite gives and recommend it to any one who is searching for true faith.
5,The RED Abercrombie or the BLUE Abercrombie?,"My 20 year old son recently was stressing to me his ability to make choices with his money. ""Honey,"" I said, ""your idea of making choices with your money is 'Do I buy the blue Abercrombie or the red Abercrombie?'"" I got this book to use on my 13-year-old. Maybe it's not too late!Thanks Ellie for some great pointers and more than a few laughs along the way!"
5,a generation raised with too much,"Here is a book to kick start parents to stop spoiling and teaching kids that possessions represent love, personal significance or status.The current generation of high school kids throws a tantrum when they aren't GIVEN 9 yes, given) a new car on their 16th birthday- and pay their own gas. well, theres only a parent to blame- stop buying and send them to work- thye truly feel entitled because they were raised on unearned praise and rewards- their language of love is things and they think their idientiy comes from having the right stiff. I see this in church kids and non-church kids. Wake up nation and reads this book"
2,I would not recommend,"I was looking for a book to help guide me and my husband to teach my child about allowance and money management. I had no idea that this is a religious based book. I am a Christian, but I don't believe that God is the answer to money questions. Furthermore, there is not any straight forward, helpful information. This book is mostly just vague ideas. I would not recommend this book"
5,Very Good,"I was glad that this was the Dutch Coin licorice that I remembered. It is sweet with just a hint of salt. I really wanted the licorice pastilles I used to get in Amsterdam when I was a child but can't seem to find them anywhere. They were small and brown and you could chew them or let them dissolve in your mouth. Let me know if you have anything like that. The closest I came was from a Dutch place in Michigan, they sell them as TV Pastilles and they are brown and white, they sell them as sweet or salty. I don't mean the salmiak or Wybertjes. I don't like those at all. In the mean time I'll enjoy these and I have plenty of them. Thank you."
5,I'm addicted!,"First of all, I love licorice but not the usual kind you find in most stores. I like the licorice from Holland. This particular kind is my favorite and I am so addicted that I now get these automatically every 4 months!"
5,Gustaf's Licorice Coins,"These coins are just as great as the licorice cats. The coins are a bit saltier and the texture may even be a bit smoother than that of the cats. I purchased both, the cats and coins, and can compare them side by side. Both will be my work companions for a long time. This style of licorice is unlike the American type of licorice with an intense licorice flavor that can be eaten almost like hard candy. The saltiness mingles wonderfully with the sweetness. If you ever had European style licorice and fell in love with it - this product is it! I am German and this product compares to Haribo licorice such as ""Katzenkinder."" Great, fast shipping, too!"
5,excellent!,"i'm still working on the bags i ordered many months ago, but i'll be ordering more after these are gone.these are NOTHING like the store-bought black licorice which, after having these, tastes very fake & kind of like plastic.don't be looking for a Twizzler type taste here! the taste is slightly salty, but true licorice flavor as well.i had no problem with them being too hard, as mentioned elsewhere. i suppose if it was cold inside my house, they might be a little hard at that point, but not because they're stale.these are just the best!"
1,"Unlike Any Licorice I'm Used To, Awful, Worst Taste Ever!","I Love Black Licorice. This is a very different taste, and not in a good way. Salty like anchovies, in fact they seemed a bit fishy."
4,Great books!,"I am a special education teacher and was very glad that I purchased these books. These books are easy to read, and easy for my students to understand as well."
3,ARSettling for the next best thing,"I had the ARS tune ""Alien"" stuck in my head one day while thinking about how it sucks to be losing my hair and decided to give purchasing the cd from where - ith it came - ith from (quoting the Bard ,sweet ,huh? ;) ANYWHO - the ""Quinella"" cd was WAAY OUT PRICED as if a fine racing horse and it's jockey Shorty McThrown came with it. Having never been THAT nutszoid over the tune ,thinking that I'd be better off just humming it for the rest of my life ,I settled for this cd,which nicely has a few of the band's other radio friendly tunes done up smoooth and tolerable. Where the HECK is my mint julip I ordered ??"
4,Good book for passing the exam,"This was my primary resource in preparations for the exam, which I passed easily. Material is well presented, although I have found several mistakes and there are a lot of superfluous ""lesson reviews"" and ""lesson summaries"" at the end of each lesson.In my opinion, the best parts of this book are practices and troubleshooting labs. I have set up a little virtual network on my PC (using Virtual PC and Virtual Server), and have done all of them. They really help you gain some practice using Active Directory tools under Windows. I had 2 questions on my exam in which one had to demonstrate practical knowledge of using these tools, and I have heard that Microsoft will add them more."
4,"Technically very clear and to the point, but lacks all the info","This book is pretty good along the lines of technical manuals. It keeps the information clear and lays it out in a way that makes it easy to understand with no fillers added. The activities at the end of the book are a little much, so I mostly ignored them. Unfortunately one thing this book lacks is ALL the information you might be tested for on the exam. For example, the book does not go into detail on the Authorization Manager. The new revisions might but check the ones you buy for it. Mine did not have it, however the software that came with the book asked questions on these different utilities that weren't covered in the book at all. It was a little suprising to be honest. But overall it was a good book."
2,Far too many technical inaccuracies,"I'm sick of reading reviews about how a particular study guide is a good book for beginers. The title says exam 70-294, but this book falls a bit short. It gives basic coverage of active directory concepts and is technically inacurate in many areas. If your going to spend the time trying to learn this stuff, learn it right. A much better book on the subject matter is the active directory technical reference for windows server 2003, also by MS Press. In fact save some time and money... Just buy the technical reference. It will prepare you for both the 70-294 and 70-297 exams. Belive me, the only reason I read this book (70-294 self paced study guide)after reading the technical reference is because I was forced to teach a course from it.RTMCT, MCSE, MCDBA, Master Instructor MS Office"
1,Absolute Garbage!,"I never had a chance to even put a nail in this thing. I was on a mission trip to Haiti, and as soon as I put a hammer in the loop, the entire apron separated from the waist cord. What terrible assembly. Since it happened the first second I tried to use it, it got pretty well trashed from laying around, so I can't even return it, that was my fault. This is a terrible product...DO NOT BUY. I only rate it a 1 because zero isn't an option"
2,Don't Bother Guys...,"This movie wasn't my cup of tea. I'm a huge gay movie watcher and unfortunatly, I bought this before seeing it first. The acting is in the same catagory as a basic (very basic) soap opera. It seems as if the director asked some of his neighbors or friends from the bar to act in this movie. It is decent for a rental if you're really, really, bored on a weeknight. Sorry guys, this just doesn't cut it in the list of good gay themed movies. Try again."
3,3 days i'd spend again,"not sure what it says about our culture that the man paid for sex is the least attractive in this movie, kind of reminded me of Robert Redford in Brubaker when he's the cutest one in a prison movie but he doesn't get raped. I think here, the characters seem a little stereotypical but less than in most gay movies and the main characters have a lot to do and many other characters to do it with. I think there might have been more emphasis on back stories as some characters seemed to have a lot and some had none but that added to a sense of mystery and intrigue that spending three days in a house on top of each other might normally lack. I liked the hot tub sequence and how they were checking each other out without checking each other out. I hope they make a sequel ""4 day weekend"" or at least, ""three day jaunt to nowhere."""
3,"Three Days, Three Stars","This is one of better, but not the best by far, of indie gay movies screened here recently. My empathy for the characters made me gloss over some of the plot weakness. However, it is enjoyable and a good bet for light entertainment. The only thing that bothers me is that everyone is just too cheery about every turn of events and acts as if life choices are consequence-free."
1,Dreadful,"This is a disaster - tedious, self-indulgent bile, peopled by unsympathetic characters, performed by a cast totally lacking in charisma. The dialogue is trite, the editing is too slow - there's about half a second too long between every single line of the film, as if the director wanted to give time for the audience to receive the importance of the words. A round-table conversation where the characters discuss how poorly gay men are represented in film would have to rank as one of the most savagely ironic moments in modern film history. Not erotic, not interesting, not likebale, not moving, not funny. Just a boring film about boring men."
1,Can I give it less than one star?,"Thank goodness I did not pay to see this movie. I couldn't sleep at 3 AM and this is what I found. If it had just been boring it would have helped the insomnia but it was so bad it was irritating. Really poor acting, totally miscast actors and every negative stereotype (ageism, non-monogamous, gym obsessed and brainless) perpetuated about gay men. The plot was totally boring and you can see that the actors are just trying to get through this disaster and move on with their lives. One review thought these were friends of the writer, director but I doubt that as there was no believable affection between these so called friends. Do not waste your money here!"
2,Go to the Shore Instead,"Stereotypes abound in this generic gay getaway flick. Happy couple. Check. Bitter couple. Check. Newbie. Check. A completely off beat character. Check. Add some lame dramatic twist, lots of talking about one's feelings, some nudity, and shake. Check, check, check, and more stirred than shakened. The pacing and production felt more like a high school play than a movie with everyone taking turns to say their lines. You've been on this trip before. Try some other location instead."
5,A Bible For Many Historians,"The distinguished New York Times writer included replies to his letters of inquiry from a host of coaches, who had been there, about their most memorable players and the evolution of changes in the game. A plethora of pictures embellishes a great history."
1,A Disaster,The video tape was a garbled mess. The return address does not exist and there is no telephone at the address. A big time GYP!
1,Unsafe,"I bought this swing, and within days the cheap plastic snap broke while my child was in the swing and she almost fell out. So, I thought I just got unlucky and bought the one swing with a defect, so I took it back and swapped it for another one. The next swing had the ropes attached to it backwards, so the back hangs lower than the front, and since the rope is built into the swing, there is no way to shorten or lengthen the ropes. I don't have the reciept or I would return it all together. Also, I noticed that the version of this swing prior to the one that is being sold now has been recalled for the problem with the snaps breaking. I think it is a matter of time before we will see a recall for this swing too. BTW -- my child LOVES swinging, so of course the toy is 'fun,' but it isn't safe."
5,Great Buy!,"My 4 month old son loves this swing. He falls asleep in it all the time. In order to attach this to our overhanging, we had to purchase additional swing chain and anchors that you can get at any hardware store, but it was a cinch to install. Would highly recommend. It's very safe w/the harness."
1,Unsafe and uncomfortable Strap design,"I purchased this swing for my 9 month old son. He loves to swing. However the swing straps on this swing seemed to annoy him. Due to the design of the straps he was able to free himself, and just hang over the safety bar. The design also seemed to push him down and caused him to slouch and lean in unconfortable ways, so he never wanted to stay in this swing very long. The rope was also very short, as the instructions indicate swing should be no more than 18"" off the groud, and ours was easily 3'. Rope was also hard to adjust to swing straight, so he was always swinging a bit crooked. We returned it after only 3 days and purchased a roadster child swing at the Home Depot(also found on amazon)it looks like a little car, and baby just loves it, and I can tell he is comfortable and safe!"
5,Lil Tikes makes mommy smile!,"Great gift to our triplet grandbabies - yes there are three swinging at once, how precious! This product is excellent, inspires a great sense of security as they swing. We would like to have had longer hanging option(s)... had to purchase pieces/parts to extend. Otherwise -- fantastic! (And a very special thanks to Amazon; without your community we could never have found them ""off season"".)"
5,Little Tikes 2-in-1 Snug & Secure Swing,This is a great swing and the kids love it. It seems to be safe and it was easy to put up.
5,This is Great!,My 1 year old daughter loves this swing. She will actually swing in it for hours at a time. We have a custom swing set that has 2 single swings for kids and in the middle it has a double swing for the adults. I sit and read while she swings. Every once in a while I give her a push. She is very comfortable in it too. Great way to relax on a nice warm summer day!
2,Consumer in Virginia,I just purchased this swing for my 9 month old set of twins and am not very pleased with the shoulder straps. It has the five point restraint safety feature but the shoulder straps keep sliding no matter how much I shorten the straps.
3,Uncomfortable for smaller babies...,"I researched about 4 swings and decided on this one b/c of the harness. My child is 9 mons, within suggested age, but is a bit small at 16 lbs and 26 inches. Once I had the straps adjusted an hour later we were ready to go. He kept slouching down looked sooo uncomfortable!! He is almost walking and can very much support his body. To keep him comfy in it I have to put a receiving blanket behind him and one rolled up where the t bar is. We have only had it for 2 days and I decided I did not want to do this every time he wants to swing. I am so disappointed since this is the only one I could find with this kind of harness. I went today and got another brand that has a recline feature and a snack tray so we can eat outside. He is much more comfy in it."
3,"Great, but hard to depress the release buttons.","We opted for this swing after being frustrated with the high back swings you simply set your child in (too hard to get him out). This swing with the front bar was preferable, but releasing the straps was always troublesome. You have to depress the buttons just right and with a LOT of pressure to get them to release."
2,Poor strap design,"We purchased this swing 4 years ago. The strap design makes it extremely difficult to get children in and out quickly. After four years the straps are completely gone. My two boys (5 and 3) enjoy it now with the middle harnass tucked under; however, I am now shopping for a new swing to use with my 1-year-old. This swing is great for the older children, but I would not recommend it for small children who need to be strapped in simply because of how difficult the straps are to undo."
4,My son's giggle swing,"My son is 7 months old and we tried this at a Farm that sees many kids and they had this swing. That is a good sign, and it was holding up just great there.It was his first swing ride and his just laughed and smiled with joy. I really love how you don't have to lift them WAY above your head to get them out. The t-bar just flips down out of the way. The straps are a little hard to press in to undo, but no big deal. I love how it leans back so he's very secure and safe in it. We are getting one for our house now."
4,Very Pleased,"This swing does, in fact, hang lop-sided, but swings fine. Our 11 month old loves to swing with his big sister. I love the over the shoulder straps for that extra bit of safety and peace of mind!"
5,Very nice!!!,This swing has been perfect for our little boy. We purchased it when he was 18 months and he loved it! He is now almost 2 and still loves it. He is a hefty child (30 pounds at age 2) and the swing is holding up great--very durable because he does a lot of swinging! We plan of having this around for a while!
2,Not Entirely Crazy About This One,"We've had this swing for three years and it finally broke. I've been anticipating the break from day one. One of the locks on the bar finally snapped off. They're the hardest things to get open once your child is in the swing. Both of my kids loved it though. My major complaint is the straps that attach to the swingset. They were too long and no matter how many times we adjusted them, the swing always went crooked. Looking for a DIFFERENT swing now for my almost two year old son."
2,It's Ok...there are better swings out there.,"I purchased this swing for my son when he was about 10 months old. The straps are tough to adjust and can be very hard to unhook. I would not recommend it for Grandparents. My sons grandmother could not unhook the straps and had to SQUEEZE him out of the swing. Needless to say, I would not buy it again."
4,he loves it,"my son is 6 mo. and 18lbs. he loves this swing. granted, he is a little on the small side for it. when we first purchased the swing we had to bumper him with towels to give him a more secure fit. this is something he will grow into and it gives us great outdoors time together."
3,Little Tykes 2 in 1 Snug Secure Swing?,"We bought this swing at WM. It lasted less than 1.5 years before it suddenly broke, I reasoned, at first, it could be due to weather but why would you make a swing that couldn't stand up to the weather? Last fall, when I had my 10 month old grand daughter in the swing, the right strap simply snapped apart. I grabbed the swing in time and felt blessed that the front held by the left strap but it really gave me a scare because she was leaning on it. I always had a lot of faith in little Tykes products or I never would have bought this swing. It never occurred to me that the straps could age that quickly and simply snap apart at the area where it snaps into the little lock hole on the tilt up device that holds the child inside. I liked it pretty well until that happened. Now, I will never purchase this swing again and I would not recommend it to anyone. I'm looking at some commercial type toddler swings instead."
3,"Great book, should be revised","Small facts, many lists. Fun to read. There are many errors though: some blatant omissions (lists head-of-states of many nations/empires but some obvious countries absent), lists that appear just in this book (try googling some of the more obscure ones), lists that are superficial and could be more complete in the same space allotted. Would benefit by citing sources. Waiting for a revision."
2,Not in P.J.'s league.,"This guy has been hyped by O'Rourke and the very talented Jonah Goldberg, but the laughs are few and far between. He just can't find the humor in every situation like P.J. can. In the Booknotes interview, Ferguson talks about how he really doesn't like writing all that much, and the lack of joy certainly shows.His 1993 (i.e. pre-WWW) essay on the Internet, which takes the general tone of ""this contraption will never amount to anything"" was way off base, maybe because he wandered into alt.sex (desperately searching for some grist I guess but coming away with his usual pedestrian non-insights) instead of looking at the comp.* newsgroups."
1,Yellowstone Red by Tom Ray,"Yellowstone Red is the narrative of an early day character who actually lived in Montana from territory to statehood. After apparently being orphaned, Yellowstone Red lived with the Sioux Indians who treated him with kindness. The Sioux taught him to live off the land and require little in the way of material possessions to survive. Yellowstone Red married and settled in the Yellowstone Valley near what is now Sidney, Montana. His struggles are chronicled with those of the early day settlers to the area. The places he mentions are real. The people are listed either by name and pseudonym. If you have roots in Montana, you may find an ancestor mentioned in this engaging story."
3,music to fuel a depression,"This is a must buy for fans of Stuart Staples (Tindersticks), Michael Johnson (when he's not with Dinosaur Jr.) and any other languidly paced depressive lounge singer. This is why Lilly invented Prozac."
4,A Bit Overdone At Times But Still A Thriller,"I may get his name a bit wrong but I think it was Ike Eisenman and Kim Richards who starred in Escape to Witch Mountain and Return To Witch Mountain. They were a little older in this movie and just as good. I know all the actors in fact, who played the father and mother, the psychiatrist, and the guy selling the puppes (R.G. Armstrong). I did feel the scene involving the mating of the female German shepherd a bit overdone but the movie had plenty of chills as it rose to a climax. Richard Crenna being a favorite of mine, it was fun watching him investigate the matter and seek out a way to save his family from the demon dog in their household. Good acting on the part of the dog but I missed the trainer's name. As I am sure others have said, you cannot take the movie too seriously. After all, it is not a documentary, just a good, old-fashioned horror movie that kept my interest from start to finish."
4,A great resource for parents and teachers,"Children with Down Syndrome are often delayed in developing speech but can compensate for this delay by using sign language and other skills in a technique called Total Communication. This guide provides a wealth of information about speech and language development in children with Down syndrome. Parents learn what to expect as communication skills progress from infancy through early adolescence, how Down syndrome can affect those skills, and what they can do to maximize their child's potential in this crucial area of development. This book was recommended by our son's speech therapist."
2,Only basic description of XML,"The book is very weak in content and has absolutely no practical examples. I'm not an expert in XML, so I won't give a technical estimate, but with new technology like XML one should not only show his favorable opinion, but provide examples to prove it's value. Title is also very misleading - in fact you've got a combination of 'appreciating the need of xml' and XML short description."
4,"thumbs ""UP"" Crisp Catchy Power Pop","This CD shines with respect to its production and recording quality. It's filled with ingenious hooks, top notch pop vocals, loads of power chords and unpredictable ""catch you by surprise"" song patterns. Like any CD, it has its strengths and weaknesses. ""Never Been Told"" is about the only weakness as it places itself in more of an 80s Garage sound which is fine it's just the track is somewhat meager as compared to the only other 80s Garage Rocker ""Put Me Down"" which is superb. ""What To Do"" is a well written and constructed power pop ballad. It's got excellent mood that that wraps itself around the song from start to finish. ""Whenever I'm Gone"", ""What To Do"" and ""Lay It On, Elaine"" are the CD's top strengths with respect to its power pop genre. The remaining tracks certainly should not be overlooked."
5,An Excellent Resource,This small book will garner large results in your group! This book gives practical guidance for starting a small group ministry in your church. It provides Bible studies that help get your group going as well as those that will get them growing. It helps the small group leader decide what type of group they have and what type of leader they are. Every church small group leader should own a very well worn copy of this book!
1,Future Zone,"Not worth seeing, this is below a B movie, even for the day. After the first ten minutes I watched it in fast forward."
1,Predestination ?,"""The mind of man is like an enchanted glass, full of superstitions, apparitions, and impostures.""............... Francis Bacon"
3,Pseudo-science or not?,"Another reviewer claims that you will either love this book or hate it; there is no in-between. I'm inclined to agree with that assessment. The author borrows concepts of panspermia (life originating in outer space) from Hoyle and Wickramasinghe, which I really did not find convincing, and I've also read Hoyle's ""The Intelligent Universe."" However, he does make good points about the so-called 'primordial soup' that scientists speak of when discussing the origin of life.While it might be premature to speak of the death of Darwinism, the theory really does not answer many questions that it should. My general complaint against evolution is Darwin's interpretation of the evidence, not the evidence itself. I found some of Dr. Joseph's conclusions far-fetched, and rather than this book I would easily recommend anything by Jonathan Wells, Lee Strobel, or Michael Behe."
2,Hoyle rehash,"Joseph is obviously a keen follower of the work of Fred Hoyle and Chandra Wickramasinghe because this book is just a recycling of H&C's ideas on panspermia. These ideas are pretty interesting but unfortunately they've been around for at least 25 years! Hoyle has always been at odds with the mainstream and is a true revolutionary or, at least, reactionary. What's more, much of his work on organic stuff in space and world-to-world seeding - once thought so fantastic - are now seeping into orthodox exobiology. Joseph would have been better off acknowledging where he got his ideas from up front, and then presenting some of his own views as an add-on."
1,What a bad quality battery,"What a horrible battery. It dies within a day or two even when the phone is on stanbby or low usage! Well, it is always true that ""you got what you paid for!!!"""
2,Wasted money,"This was the only replacement battery I could find for my Samsung D807- and found it to be of poor quality. It drained so easily and quickly that I had to recharge every day. After just a couple of months, I put the original battery back in. Even though it is almost 2 yr old, it still holds a charge at least twice as long as this replacement. I feel like I blew my money on a ""dud""."
1,Order never received,I never received this item. I waited a month for it. I was very disappointed; it was a Christmas gift. I informed Eastbay and I was told that there was a problem with the order. I then asked that the order be canceled. I was told that they would need to ask Amazon to order the refund on my credit card. Please follow=up and let me know the status of this refund. Thank you.
3,"Lug Nuts - sometimes, other bolts - great!","I got this becuase I didnt have air tools.Its NOT a replacement for a true air wrench. However it isnt a bad substitute.""Crack"" the lug nuts using a *large* 4 cross before jacking the car and then use the wrench to spin em off and back on. Dont spin em on too tight - and set the torque using an accurate ""clicker"" type torque wrench.That being said - for many other bolts its a life saver.Front wheel drive stub axle hexes. I cant BUDGE those things uisng a huge breaker bar (the car moves!) but this wrench will bust em off - eventually.The tool will get hot with extended use.Its HEAVY but rugged. I drop/drag mine all across the floor all the time.Wear hearing protection and safety glasses as well as using the appropriate IMPACT sockets.Too heavy IMHO for ""construction"" work."
1,Forget it for lug nuts/Auto or Truck use,"I could not remove lugs torqued at 95ft/lbs,just sat there. My air impact easly removed them,and I could remove the lugs by hand without a problem. They were torqued with a torque wrench,Husky brand(not a cheap wrench),not rusted and no extension and impact socket was used(craftsman). Tightening was better but not even 95 ft/lbs, and you have to stay on the wrench along time and it will get very hot. I do not tighten with an impact normally but I wanted to see what the tool would do. Tried 3 of them from a local store,could not be an isolated problem,bad design for non woodworking use."
1,Lacks needed torque,"I bought this wrench to work on automobiles at home. I had hoped to use it on lug nuts and ""stubborn"" nuts and bolts. I was very disappointed when it would not take off lug nuts which I had hand torqued to 100 ft/lbs. I am almost able to hold the socket still just with my hand.This wrench is useless for automotive work. Perhaps it could be of use in deck building, such as tightening up carriage bolts, etc.Very unfortunate."
4,must use impact sockets with this,"you really must use impact sockets (black steel) with this (and all) impact wrenches.....regular chrome sockets will not work as they have too much ""play"" in them....;.."
4,Living with a greyhound,"This book does give good iformation on greyhounds.However it does make it sound as though you have to be with your greyhound 24/7. In my case, my greyhound does do well with being separated from us for a few hours at a time. The bottom line is if your not a dog person willing to give your time and devotion to any dog,then a greyhound or any dog breed is not for you, and you shouldn't have a dog. All dogs need time and attention,they also need trained.You just have to remember,that although a greyhound is fully grown,when they come into your home they are like a giant puppy."
4,Pretty good case,"This is a pretty nice case overall. I bought it because it had that egg crate cushioning as the padding for the inner case. I thought the bumps would be bigger to be honest and when I pushed one in with a bit of pressure, it never came back up. So i got about 4-5 cushion bumps that seem to be forever depressed inwards which bothers me. Still its a good case with a nice feel and the inner zipper line is cushioned too so you don't have to worry about the laptop rubbing against it. Just don't try to push any of the bumps in."
3,=/,i honestly thought that this product would be better than what it is. it doesnt moisturize my hair as much as i would like it too. and it doesnt make it any easier to untangle it. im actually a little disappointed. i have very curly hair so therefore i need the moisture this product however didnt work as wellas i thought it would.
5,Heavenly Hair!,"God bless the creators of Matrix Biolage Conditioning Balm! This is by far the best conditioner my hair has ever seen! There are already several other glowing reasons, so I won't drone on and on. Just know that this conditioner is heaven for hair...thick, creamy, concentrated, and HIGHLY moisturizing!"
3,nothing amazing,"i expected more from this conditioner but it works just like the regular conditioner such as Pantene, Dove, Garnier etc. I don't see any improvement of my hair condition after using it for 3 weeks"
1,it seemed that it was used and had dried product on the tub,"Very disappointing , and it seemed like it had already been opened since an amount of this product was missing from the container and had some dried product all over the out side of the container like it was already used..? I will never buy from this seller ever again, I got a partly filled container of hair conditioner...!my advice is don't buy from this seller, so buyer you better beware...!! I got less then excected...! for the price I paid..!!! Biolage by Matrix hair Conditioning Balm Treatment 8.5 Ounces by Matrix"
5,Great curly girl friendly conditioner,"The only downside to this product is the price. Unfortunately, it is a bit costly in my opinion, but it's not loaded with silicones like MOST conditioners on the market, especially those found in Salon lineups. Silicones make your hair feel nice, but repel moisture. It's(using silicone filled conditioners/products) sort of like putting a band-aid on a broken leg.Ingredients:Water, Propylene Glycol, Myristyl Alcohol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Decyl Oleate, Rosemary Extract (Rosemarinus Officinalis), Goldenseal (Hydrastis Canadensis), Algae Extract, Chitosan PCA, Quaternium 79 Hydrolyzed Keratin, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Diazolidinyl Urea, FragranceThis is curly girl friendly also, which is great for moisture loving locks and those who avoid daily shampoos as your hair will not become lifeless & greasy."
3,Nothing special,"I had high hopes for this as it got positive reviews. It doesn't seem to do much. But it is just average, nothing special."
5,For damage har,"Very good for damage har , and colored har. A good product at that price cheaper than at a box store!"
1,I didn't like it at all.,"I bought this conditioning balm in hopes of building up my hair product supplies in case of moving to another location, where I can't get the bulk of my stuff. Well I originally tried it on wet hair and just let it sit on my hair. After I rinsed, my hair was very tangled and my hair did not feel soft at all. I decided to give it another chance and this time, I sat under a dryer inorder to open up my scalp, etc etc for a deep conditioning. Nope, the same thing happened, my hair didn't feel soft and it was once again, tangled. What I did notice was a speed in drying time. I had to cut off my ceiling fan inorder for me to style my wet hair."
5,love this stuff,"I have kept my hair short for a long time since I had such trouble with long hair when I was young. My hair is fine, one would think that dry brittle hair was not a problem. After turning 50 and having, um more than several hair coloring treatments, my hair was very dry. I decided to grow it out for one last mid life crisis fling, and started using Jason vitamin thin to thick shampoo along with gelatin capsules, and used the conditioning balm. I use it daily, and my hair grew from at my ears to middle of my back in abt six months! and with the conditioning balm, my hair went from brittle to brilliant. I love this stuff, it is great. My hair is thick, full, long and very soft. My husband goes ga ga over it."
2,One big problem - difficult to read the time on the face of this watch.,"I love skagen watches -- this one is beautiful. However, I have difficulty actually reading the time! The hands do not stand out from the black background - therefore I am disappointed in my purchase."
5,green light for the green room,"joe at green room surf shop helped me out a great deal. i actually had to exchange my sandals for a larger size. the transaction went super smooth, and they were very professional and pleasant throughout the transaction. i would definitely recommend doing business with these guys."
3,Not for laymen!!!,"If you are a scientist and can understand all the concepts in this book, then this book is for you. If you are a student who has been assigned this book, the best of luck to you. Perhaps Astronomy for dummies would have helped..."
2,HINGE MATE HM 1100W DOOR HINGE TEMPLATE,COSTLY AND TOO DIFICULT TO USE FOR THE NOVICE. EVEN THE PEOPLE WHO INSTALLED MY 14 DOORS DIDN'T WANT TO USE IT.
5,Great Tool,Just bought just this month and the product looks fantastic. It looks solid and easy to use. You need to see it to believe it.
2,Overview only,"Nice book, but you must read other books about decision making to understand what this book is all about."
4,Renaissance Italy,"In this story full of historical details about Florence in the 1490s, a wealthy Florentine family's cook, Giuditta, sets out to exonerate her patron, the family's much maligned daughter-in-law Bella. Bella has been accused of murdering her mother-in-law, and her innocence now depends on Giuditta's ability to track down clues proving her innocence. Luckily, Giuditta, being a servant, can search in places that rich Florentines never could. A fun story."
1,Amateurish,"It's difficult to believe that the author of this stiff, amateurishly written novel is a journalist who has written three other novels, After plodding through this one, I certainly wouldn't seek out her other works!Although the emphasis on food was fun and Giuditta the Cook an unusual heroine, the plot is lame; the descriptions and dialogue are awkward, the writing style just about non-existent, and the ending totally flat.After reading some marvelous novels set in the Renaissance, such as Michael Ennis's ""Duchess of Milan,"" or Diane Haeger's ""Courtesan,"" this book in comparison reads more like an effort produced for a college writing class.Don't waste your money on it."
3,Ok,I enjoy Miikes movies with all the different kinds he makes. This was a good movie to watch but it wasn't one of my favorite of Miike. I like to be suprised in horror films and it seemed kind of predictable.
2,A misstep by an otherwise EXCELLENT director,"I'm a big fan of director Takashi Miike, so it pains me to say that this is the first film of his that I found pretty damned disappointing. As prolific as Miike is, one would HAVE to forgive him an occasional misstep, but THIS film looks like it could've been made by any marginally talented director looking to milk a few screams from the Asian teenybopper market. Maybe I'm a bit jaded at the age of 48, but I didn't find it remotely scary or even all that creepy, and it really could've gotten away with a PG-13 rating. I suppose in this age in which everyone is so utterly obsessed with their cell phones, a film like this was inevitable and that's why it seems awfully contrived. I'm glad the American remake was so roundly castigated by critics."
3,"Interesting idea, but gets bogged down at the end","I've really enjoy the new wave of Japanese horror. This movie is no exception, I liked the idea, and if I'm not mistaken, I've already seen this on an old twilite zone episode only the phone was rotary and the phone calls were coming from a freshly dug grave. This has been updated with cell phones, just the ending got confusing, but it was worth watching. Enjoy!"
2,This is better than the American version???,"This got a better review than the same American movie. I would not suggest this movie at all. It makes no sense even for a horror movie. I like some semblence of ""this could happen"" in my movies and this does not have it. I fell asleep. I can't imagine how bad the American one is.Spoiler Alert. the whole movie revolves around a phone call coming to one person after another and each dies. The result, a dead person is making the calls because her body was abandoned in an old defunct hospital. Not for nothing but IF she could dial these numbers and get a message across, why not just call one person and say ""I have been abandoned in this hospital please come and get my body"". Case closed."
4,I Shouldn't have watched it late at night...,"... because I had nightmares the rest of the evening. I actually woke up moaning in terror at one point. This is probably the scariest of all the J-Horror films I've seen so far, keeping in mind I have yet to see the original versions of The Ring and The Grudge. I didn't give it 5 stars only because of the indecypherable ending... but that didn't spoil the overall creepiness and terror of the film."
1,Great Movie - Poor Quality DVD,"After having first watched this movie on Netflix DVD, I decided to purchase and make it part of my permanent collection. I was saddened by the poor quality of the Amazon DVD. The Amazon video lacked brightness whereas the NetFlix video was sharp and the colors velvety smooth, having a depth that made you part of the movie. The audio quality was not as crisp either. I am going to contact Netflix to find out where they purchase their DVDs."
2,Dumb Story,"This is the worst Asian movie that I have ever seen. The story is dumb and doesn't make any sense, especially the ending. And to top it off it isn't that scary - it only gets a little bit scary at the end.My recommendation: Don't get this movie. It is also too expensive. It you want to watch a good Asian horror movie, I have lots of recommendations. Wishing Stairs is pretty good. Koma is an excellent movie. A Tale of Two Sisters is pretty good. Good luck."
3,Wasted talent,"How the hell can you make a video that has the talent of Ray Dalke in front of the camera, and not make a great video? Well that's what's happened here I'm afraid. Too much talk and too little action. Dalke is a legend and rightly so, but the producers of this video did not do him justice. Can't reccomend."
4,Between humour and poetry,"The work has its own narrative frame, i. e. people in a bar under the sea tell stories to each other. One may imagine the part given to the ""marvellous"", to the fairy-like genders. But, more than this, Stefano Benni is excellent in both the most crazy humour, based on exaggerations, and in the almost ""romantic-like"" poetry. This book mixes, in an harmonious way, both sides of this Italian writer. The tales told in the book belong to tender, nice stories (the extraterrester being, visiting Earth) or to funny sketches (the devil in a luxury restaurant). The work has its own narrative frame, i. e. people in a bar under the sea tell stories to each other."
2,Exorcist Done Italian Style,The Tempter is an Italian's ripoff of the Exorcist.Carla Gravina is a very campy actress in this not-too scary horror flick.
4,Love It,"I am a recent culinary school graduate. During my time in school I've learned to make only 2 flavored brulee's. I received the book and looked thru it, and I am excited to start baking. It has many flavors for a creme brulee and other small recipes."
5,Good girls ... Great music,Another excellent Ace product. These guys just keep coming up with the goods with every CD release. Every track is a winner here. Stand outs would be the original 'My Boy Lollipop' and the fantastic voice of Timi Yuro. I have all 5 volumes in this series. Could quite possibly squeeze another volume(or 2)??
3,I received a paperback instead of hard cover,I'm very pleased that I received this book.I have one issue that I'm not happy it's the fact that I received a copy that is a paperback instead of the hard cover that was specifically mentioned on the site while I bought it.Not sure how this may be corrected since the price was double for the hardcover.Thanks for the serviceAssaf
3,Good instruction,"This is a good instructional dvd, packed with exercises, drills, and techniques, both traditional and modern. It's not professional, but that certainly doesn't hurt its value. The only complaint I have, is that the last half is horrible to unwatchable due to scrambled picture. That's probably just a problem with my personal copy of the dvd though."
4,lester griffiths' savate dvd,"I enjoyed this dvd as an intro to the sport. the beginning is a little tough to navigate and long, though. there is a good warm up at the beginning and he goes right into techniques.He hurries through the techniques a little, so you can't practice with them while you are watching, but you can pause it an do them or what i do is write down what they are doing and practice at my leisure.I like the techniques, they are different than most other styles of kickboxing and are fun to do. i do them solo and feel like i have learned a lot. again, as an intro, i think it is good."
2,False Advertising,"A young man goes about in a leather jock-strap instructing people on how to kick each other. For some reason, he is not wearing it on the cover of the DVD box.The cover also advertises ""Savate take-down techniques.""There are none.I wrote Lester about this and he did not even reply, which is about par for the course for this kind of low-intelligence sort of thing.He presents some good combinations for a savate workout."
4,Nice first reader with beautiful photographs,"The first thing that grabs the reader are the pictures: as with all Seymour Simon books, the photographs in ""Baby Animals"" are marvelous. The appealing subject of baby animals is written for very beginning readers, but it provides interesting information even at that level (great for my son who was not a big fan of Bob Books and the like). The tear-out (perforated card stock) ""trading cards"" at the back of the book were a fun addition.Not quite the best book in the series (the one on firefighting comes to mind as one with more information and more appeal to my son at least), but still quite enjoyable."
5,Plight of minorities in secular India,This is perhaps the first and may be the last book written after years of exhaustive research on the conditions of Muslims in India.K.L.Gauba was a prominent lawyer in India. He was against the partition of India. This is a book that all people from South Asia must read to find out where India stands in its quest of secular ideals of Nehru and Gandhi.If anyone is interested in truth about India then they should read this book
5,great chamber playing of inspired chamber works,"You know you've accomplished something when you can take a work like the Strauss here""Till Eulenspiegel"",wrench it away from its conception of the mammoth orchestra to make an arrangement that does justice. When you have performers who intimately know the original Strauss you have a special situation, and that's what's here with the Chicago Pro Musica. All members of the Chicago Symphony who like to keep the tradition of chamber music alive. They also commission new works for them to concertize and sometimes record. Walton's ""Facade"" is also a tailor made work for this ensemble with its seemless lines,and overwhelming warm lyricism."
1,:( :( :(,"These don't worth the money. The quality of the fabric is okay. However the edges are so rough that you won't want to walk on them bare feet, it is because the plastic on the back was poorly attached that it bleeded to the front so your feet step on the hard plastic. In a word, poorly made."
2,Not too good...,"The overall texture and taste are disappointing, compared to the balsamic reductions I had on Granville Island in Vancouver, BC from an Edible British Columbia stand at the market.I ended up ordering the Edibles-BritishColumbia products, more expensive, smaller quantity, but oh! so, so much better."
2,Balsamic???,"The actual ingredients of this product is listed as: Balsamic vinegar of Modena 53% (wine vinegar, grape must, dye E150d), grape must, wheat syrup, modified cornstarch. The fact is, wine vinegar isn't the same as balsamic vinegar. We tasted balsamic creme in Modena, Italy made from balsamic vinegar, thickened with carob and it was smooth & tangy. Not as strong & acidic as this product. We placed the order because it was listed above the Carandini name on the site and we misunderstood that it's made by this authentic balsamic producer. We paid about $12 for a 225 ml bottle of the ""real balsamic creme"" from Italy. Quick and efficient service from Earthy Delights, but not the balsamic we expected."
5,easy to install,I purchased these to avoid a heavy metal bed rail system. They were simple and easy to install on the bottom of springs section of my full size bed. The beige color almost disappears against the beige carpet in the bedroom. The bed is still very sturdy.
4,Sex and narcisscism meet fear and whiskey,"No doubt goaded off their collective arse by the success of agitpopsters Chumbawamba and Stereolab (whom they even ape on the jaw-dropping ""Thunder""), the Mekons surprise by proving they had at least one more good one in them. The album concerns itself with the dual boredoms of our day -- sex and narcisscism -- with lyrcis that range from ominous obliqueness to deadpan hilarity. (Hearing Sally Timms' blase recitation from a sex-toy catalogue in ""Tourettes"" is a highlight.) The music proves the Mekons have been keeping up on current trends in atmospheric, beat-heavy music. Here's a suggestion to the band: follow ME with KONS, a suite about the criminals of caapitalism!"
5,2 Thumbs Up,"I was actually only looking to purchase the CP filter, but when I saw this bundled with a UV, for just a few more bucks, I couldn't pass it up. So far, the pics I've taken with these filters have turned out great!"
3,Like the Product - Not a Fan of the Distributor,"I ordered this product for my new Nikon D200 camera. The product was at a fair price and arrrived quickly.This shipment is supposed to contain two components - a clear UV protection filter (mostly to protect the lens) and a circular polarizer filter (to help make the sky bluer and reduce reflected light).HOWEVER, the state it arrived in was shocking:1) Half the shipment was missing (the circular polarizing filter was not present)2) The UV filter wasn't in its original Tiffen protective packaging, but was instead floating around the box loose in a plastic bag.3) Product had clear scuffs and scratches.It would appear to me that the Tiffen product is good. However I cannot recommend J&R; (and therefore Amazon) as a good source for buying this particular product. It arrived in a shocking state and is being returned."
3,Good general use filters,"I bought this really for the circular polarizer, since I already have a UV filter. The UV filter and the circular polarizer set seems to be of pretty good quality and a good value. Other circular polarizers cost at least 50% more.The downside is that the filters do not seem to be coated in anyway. Doesn't seem to be a big deal with the circular polarizer."
1,Very disappointed.,"Had to send them back - VERY disappointed. The polarization of the circular polarizer was okay - but as you dialed the polarization down, a warm tone seeped into the image. So you either had cool (temp) polarized image, or a non-polarized, warm image. I could only handle it for about 30 mins before I went back inside and removed the filters and put it back in the box. Didn't even try the UV filter."
4,Tiffen Filters are good,Tiffen Filters are good quality and will suffice in most cases. There was a great deal on this twin pack.
4,Does the trick,There isn't much to say about something as simple as a filter. These fit together and work together well and the polarized filter eliminates almost all glare.
3,Hmmmm...,Apparently I am spoiled on Hoya filters... those are cheaper and not as good. They get dirty very easy and somehow dust came between them on some occasion. Will buy Hoya next time
5,"Kanei uechi,a true master","I have been a student of Uechi Ryu since 1979,a fine style for those of short stature.The previous review would have been more appropriate if it were in english."
1,Sounds good...on paper!,"First, the shipping carton arrived completely open at one end. Along with the product hanging out and some packing materials, there was an invoice for someone in Michigan (I live in Georgia!). My info was nowhere to be found!As for the $200 speaker, anything treble skips out intermittently and causes only the subwoofer to be playing. Completely shutting down and restarting solves that problem, but who wants to do that every 5 minutes when you're trying to listen to music??To top it off, Sharper Image won't respond to my email complaints (unless you count the bot-response). I'm very disappointed."
5,What I've been waiting for.,"The iTower is perhaps one of the best speakers I have ever received. Although skeptical at first about the quality of sound that could possibly be played from such a akward looking thing, I found myself mistaken. This stereo is capable of producing extremely vivid highs and mids, and smooth lows. Although most of what I listen too is treble heavy, I found no problem with the bass on deeper songs. The unit itself is very sleek looking, calling attention to it to anyone walking in the room. In conclusion, this speaker is sleek, convenient, and produces extremely good sound; if you're looking for something more permanent for an iPod speaker, this is the one."
1,impostor... this one,"I read quite a few rave reviews on this DVD writer, and bought it even though the Sony DRU-800A was cheaper.Well the drive looks great... awesome quality, finish & style... but as spongebob said... it just wont fit in my case!So I'd suggest checking the specs, and making sure it's gonna fit in your case before you order it. And just don't bother if you've got a dell 4700 or lesser! Sony's a better option there."
3,"Good Driver, Poor Design","Who ever designed this drive doesn't know anything about computer cases. I ended up having to take a Skillsaw and cut out my computer case front, just to fit the thing in. CHECK THE SIZE FIRST, it will only fit a select few cases."
2,faded ribbon,The ribbon design is good. The problem I have is the yellow color has faded in less than two months or someone has taken my new one and put their old one in place of it!!I have not put the camo ribbon on my vehicle yet. If I purchase a new yellow one I will mark it so that I will know if someone has replaced.
1,"Great effort from programmers, but no fun!","This game should be a part of the basic training to submarine new members. It has so much details that had spoilt the fun of the game. To shoot a single target, you will have to navigate through three or four windows and make estimations and press dozens of buttons to get an idea wbout where is your target and what is its exact type. So boring that I couldn't play it more than 1 hour, only listening to lectures about sonar systems!"
4,Not quite as good as 'empty bell ringing in the sky',"If you could only purchase one Pelt CD, don't get this one--get Empty Bell instead. This is a fantastic album and marks their departure from shorter noise pieces to extended hypnotic work--but what they start here reaches maturity on the album to follow (again, Empty Bell) and continued on Rob's Choice. Still the thought of listening to all three albums in a row is almost too much to comprehend."
3,READ the description!,"Come on, if you read the description, you would find that it says ""the story"", not stories, and it says 95 minutes running time. Is that enough of a clue??!! Also, Amazon did not decide it was a ""season"", the producer(s) of the cover decided that. Give Amazon a break! If you like Jack Frost, you'll buy it; if not, you won't."
4,Fine by me!,"I own all the Frost seasons, but because of reviews on 13, I had not ordered it. It came on sale, so wanting to keep the series whole, I did purchase it. I did not find it to be as bad as some of the other reviewers; in fact I did not find it to be bad at all. Some of the other reviews I read had issues with him and a younger woman. Well, sometime in life that happens. David Jason himself had a daughter when he was in his 60's, so I assume his wife had to be a lot younger than he was in real life! The show does not show him being intimate with this young actress anyway, so I don't understand the criticism. As for the ""season"", I found it disappointing that it was only one episode. As for the content, having watched documentaries on Endangered Species, whoever wrote the episode did their homework. The smuggling of animals happens in just this way, at times. Although this was not one of my favorite ""Frost"" episodes, I though it fit in with the rest of the show just fine."
3,AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE WELL MADE,"Frost stories generally go beyond a straight murder story, and this deals very well with the trading in rare animals. Seeing them locked in small cages, especially the tigers, really got to me. Great performances by the whole cast"
1,Rip off,"I was shocked to find that this DVD, advertised as a season, was in fact ONE episode. Very misleading. I would never have paid this much for 90 mins of entertainment."
3,"""Series"".....yeah right (I've not seen it yet)...","I share the same reviews with the other people. A series is just that, however, one episode alone - no way. The other sets do indeed have more than one d/v/d enclosed. I carefully scanned the sellers' to make sure I wasn't just buying one episode from a series. I received this through the post today, immediately thinking ""...hmmm, it's a bit small..."" and annoyed after opening it with one title and one disc (was looking forward in watching 1-3 of them at least). I believed right away someone was pulling a fast one - after browsing them all, and reading these reviews, it sure is just the one episode - bizarre. I'm yet to watch it, so can't recall what it's about even as it has been over 15 years now! Incidentally, why was there the only one episode and is series(!) 15 the same? Thanks..."
5,A Touch of Frost Season Endangered Species,Love this stuff! My only disappointment is that it was only one story on the DVD. A little expensive for just one.
4,A Disappointment in DVD and Amazon,"A Touch of Frost, Season 13.A Touch of Frost Season 13: Endangered SpeciesFor the first time Amazon without total disclosure sells a DVD stated as a Season and one gets one progrom of ninety-five minutes. This has never happened in Midsommer Murder, etc.We enjoyed the single and I want to emphasize SINGLE, program. Come on Amazon you can do better marketing than this. One program does not a season make.William Russell"
1,Rip Off,This product is a major ripoff not by Amazon but by the distributors of the film. It is advertised as season 13 but it is one episode on one disc 93 minutes long. I returned mine for credit.I have all the other seasons and I love the series but I am not paying for one episode.
1,Season 13 is very poor: Avoid!,"I've been a follower of Frost since the series first started. I have also read the books and I own all the released DVDs. I was sorry I bought season 13.Firstly, it's just one episode, and secondly the story was just plain weak by Frost standards. Even ignoring such crass adds such as the car chase and weapons usage, the main problem is that the character behavior was as if the storywriter/director had neither seen previous episodes nor understood the characters (Mullett and Frost working hand-in-hand without acrimony!). In addition, the sub-plot of an advanced relationship between Frost and a young fitness instructor is ridulous and detracts, not adds, to the storyline. If you own the previous series don't bother with this one. If you don't own the previous Seasons, buy them over this, especially Seasons 1-10."
5,Professor Johnson's Astounding Sound Show,"This is an exceptional recording of a live performance, made by Keith Johnson while he was a college student on a recorder he built himself. The professional review above incorrectly notes that the recording was made on New Year's Eve 1957 as stated in the liner notes, but it was actually 1959. Norvo and company are in fine form here. One great tune follows another.This recording is well known among several generations of audiophiles for its lifelike, natural sound. Of particular note in this regard is the track, Saturday Night,"" which has the potential to damage speakers if played too loudly. There are rumors that this album might be released in the new SACD format soon, which should elevate its already superb sound even more.Highly recommended for both its musical content and sound quality."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME,"This is the worst game ever made. Maybe it's not as bad for a console system but for a computer, I can think of hundreds of things I would've rather spent my money on. Like dinner, for one."
5,Fun Family Christmas with Kipper,"My three year old daughter has had this book for two weeks (we got it after Christmas!) and asks me to read it to her at least several times a day - without giving too much away the surprise on the last page has her fascinated! The story is a really lovely one, Mum's and Dad's will enjoy it as much as the littlies!"
1,Great Customer Reviews - My product failed in 20 minutes,"I purchased this kit several months ago, based on the excellent customer reviews. The reason for the purchase was (and is) I had several expensive speciality interior doors to install and I wanted to get things right the first time. This is versus my normal practice of having to do many things twice. I installed the kit per the instructions, started boring and within 3 minutes (or less) the bore bit sheared at the connection to the chank. I did not torque it and the pressure was moderate to light. Based on the others feedback, I suspect mine had a manufacturing flaw (not to sweet on a 300$ item). Now I get to waste my time trying to return it or get a replacement bit. Needless to say, I am disappointed hence my 1 star ...."
5,Rodale's Illustrated Encyclopedia of Organic Gardening,I love this book! Its is the best book about organic Gardening. Step by step and very simple... Every Gardener should have one..
3,Rodale's Illustrate Encyclopedia of Organic Gardening,The book was not what I thought it was going to be - too much information (which I guess is a good thing) but not enough information for what I was looking for.
2,not useable information,"This book deapointed me completly. It has only beautiful ilustrations but not useable information, waste of money..."
1,B;iss,The tracks listed for Bliss are the same tracks shown on Serene.Why is Aeoliah producing another cd with same music as playedon his cd entitled Serene?
3,Falls Short,"As a HUGE Evanescence fan, I have to say that this CD is really kind of disappointing. It's not what I was expecting out of it. The thought of their music being played strictly on the piano was an exciting thought for me, but let me tell you why my anticipation ultimately didn't result in very much. For starters, it's all played ridiculously slow, even ""Bring Me to Life,"" which is probably the fastest song on the Evanescence record (apart from ""Tourniquet""). It also lacks the emotional intensity and passion that Evanescence's music requires. It just doesn't work for me. I instead recommend the String Quartet Tribute, which, even though it lacks ""Everybody's Fool"" and ""My Last Breath,"" is a lot more appropriate in regards to how Evanescence's music should be played."
5,John Carpenters Best Movie,Once again a movie that became a straight to video cult classic but the special effects and soundtrack by John Carpenter as well as the stellar cast made this a great Action Movie.
3,More Interesting as Memoir Than as Science,"Like his more recent book Trilobyte, this book is well crafted. For the reader interested in the process of discovery by a scientist, I suspect that this book will satisfy. Sadly, I came to the book in a search for current information about the history of life on earth and was disappointed. The book drifts between stories of the author's paleontological expeditions and a discussion of theories of the history of life on earth. If the reader is actually attempting to learn what Fortey knows about that history he is left to riffle through the pages in search of information. There are some interesting discussions here, but unfortunately they are buried in chatty biography. In short, if you are interested in Richard Fortey's life, buy this book. If you are interested in life on this planet, keep looking."
4,DRY BUT INTERESTING EXPLINATION OF ORIGIN OF LIFE,"OVERVIEW OF THE CURRENT SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE ORIGIN OF LIFE AND THE SUPPORTING FOSSIL EVIDENCE FOR THE ORIGIN OF THE SPECIES. THE AUTHOR ADMITS GREAT GAPS IN THE FOSSIL EVIDENCE AND DOES NOT HAVE ANY EXPLINATION FOR SUCH BASIC EVENTS AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF EYE SITE, WINGS, ETC. THE BOOK IS INTERESTING AS FAR AS IT GOES BUT STILL DOES NOT BEGIN TO ANSWER THE WHY AND HOW OF EVOLUTION."
5,Fantastic,Finally a book that ties it all together. For those interested in the myriad of sciences that make up our world this book is a must read. Written for the general public it is easy to understand and the author makes it an exciting journey. Nothing dull about this book.
5,Just what I wanted and it works great,So glad there are companies out there that stock batteries for older cameras. This was just what I needed and it works great. Thanks to Amazon and the vendors.
3,Could Have Been Better,"A few years ago, the TNT cable network broadcast a tribute show to Johnny Cash. Comparing my VHS cassette to this album indicates that the show was far better. The Springsteen and Dylan tracks appear to have been from the show. ""Flesh and Blood,"" a spectacular song, was done far more powerfully live, here it's too mannered and self-conscious. Still, this CD has some great moments, especially Steve Earle's ""Hardin Wouldn't Run"" and Charlie Robison's ""Don't Take Your Guns to Town."""
3,OK MUSIC,"I BOUGHT THIS THINKING IT WAS JOHNNY CASH SINGING,MY MISTAKE-SHOULD HAVE READ MORE OF THE DISCRIPTION-SO ITS NOT MY FARVORITE-ITS OKAY"
4,Who Is Keb Mo?,"You need to get both Kindred Spirit and Dressed in Black to get a good Johnny Cash tribute.Two very different approaches.It's clear from both Cd's that no one can sing Cash as good as Cash.Dwight Yoakam does a good job on Understand Your Man.Little Richard,well,he does Get Rhythm in Little Richard Style.It's good!Bob Dylan and Travis Tritt fall flat.Keb Mo,never heard of him...didn't think much of his attempt.Marty Stuart is the onlyguy that comes close to Johnny Cash.Best song on the album is Meet Me In Heaven...real Carter/Cash."
3,Crawford LS4XXX Ladder Stabilizer,"I have two extension ladders, and I attached this stabilizer without a problem to my first ladder. However, the second ladder has thicker steps and rails which made installation very difficult -- I had to bend a few of the U bolts. Once installed, the stabilizer pretty much works as expected."
1,Parts missing,"I ordered one, parts missing, returned. Ordered a second, parts missing again, container opened, returned again. I really want one of these and will have to purchase it locally. Amazon was great about returning the items but I do not wish to order a third one with parts missing."
5,The best because it comes complete!,The great thing about the K&N oil filters for the Ninjette is that they come with both O-rings. The factory filters do not! This is a great time and money saver. You DO need new O-rings every time. The deal I made here on Amazon could not be beat anywhere.
5,K&N for the Win!,You can't go wrong with K&N products. The price of this filter was one-third the cost from other places which made this purchase even better!
5,Alright,Good filter and for the 250 Ninjas it included all the new O-rings needed which is something to consider when buying some of the cheaper filters.
5,Maria Treben,"Very good book, it's a must for everybody. Herbal cures, no side effects, it is working.Big pharma will loose profits if more and more people read books like this.Take your health seriously, simple cures are in sight for everyone, just open the mind, and try ... what can you loose?"
4,"fun, some different rhymes",i bought this cd for my 15 month old son but the whole family likes to listen to it together. as we are in australia there are a few different rhymes on here that we haven't heard of before but of course some golden oldies as well. very enjoyable and fun listening. recommeded. :)
5,Well Worth it,"I've been aware of Thich Nhat Hanh for about 10 years,have read about five of his books, and listened to a lot of his lectures on tape.He has a very beautiful message and a pleasant way of presenting it.I think he's the 'real deal' and he practices what he 'preaches'.He's a very good speaker and easy to follow because his message is so simple. Listening to him speak, but more importantly, practicing what he's speaking about could save your life.He also wrote 'The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching' which is a good book if your curious about that subject.I'm glad I bought this dvd."
4,Peace is every step-Meditation. Thich Nhat Hanh,"Amazing Nobel peace prize nominee, Thich Nhat Hanh.He has spent the last 50 years telling people of the futility of war, after himself surviving it in his native Vietnam.Very humbling, peace instilling film."
3,"Stiff to apply, works ... with air bubble and corner flap","The piece is much stiffer than I had imagined. So, as an unskilled person, I couldn't get it quite right. So I end up with one corner slightly open (looks bad, does not affect functionality) and a tiny air bubble somewhere else. However, the non-glare part is good. The feel is weird, but it's easy to get used to. The touch sensitivity seemed to be slightly reduced, but not so much that it affects normal use. If you are a more skilled applicator than I am, go for it."
1,Very poor audio/video mastering,"I might have been able to overlook the narrator's butchering of the Japanese language. However, the choppiness of audio/video playback made the DVD unwatchable. I'm returning my DVD in case it's simply defective, but take this as a warning.The little bit that I was able to view lacked the production quality (details, camera angles) of more modern products."
4,Tight G-Funk Melodies,"First of all, I mean to give this album 5 stars. Swoop G takes the LBC by storm in 1997 with Undisputed. he is a tight lyricist, and adapts well to his variable beats. Beatwise, the general feel is, of course, G-Funk. A few beats may be a little weak, but then there are several that are surefire classics. The standout track is ""G's house."" The beat takes you back to a time when the West was on top, and fun, relaxing G-Funk beats were blazing in stereos all around. it is perfect for lowriding around the town. Some Bay area heavy hitters like 3X krazy, Cydal, and The Luniz rap on the album, and some others like Bosko produce hot tracks like ""Gangsta in California,"" and JT Bigga Figga creates fire on ""Who Got the Gangsta S--- pt.II."" So, there is a medley of a Long Beach and Bay Area feel to the whole record. So, despite a couple of songs with weaker beats, the album is a definite late 90's banger!"
4,"Technical, but interesting","This is a really technical and (obviously, by the title) linguistic explanation of the Spanish language. The author takes a very unorthodox slant on explaining Spanish. Once you get through the complexity of his explanations, you'll see how fascinating he really is. This book has offered me some new tools to use in class. If you're looking for this book, you're probably going to use it as you work on your masters at UNI...good luck!"
1,a piece of junk!!!!,"I got this around the first of the year to set-up my home network.After much frustration and lots more $ the Geeks arrived and deemed it worthless.of course it is past its return date,I would run the other way."
4,Great Router for the Price,I bought this router to replace an older D-Link I had been using. I was somewhat weary about buying another D-Link but some of my friends convinced me that they had gotten better. After receiving the router I began the setup process which was relatively easy. The only complaint I have about it would be the same as I have always had with D-Link being that the administrative screens are sometimes complex to navigate. The range of service for the router seems to be good. My home is made of all brick and I am still able to receive a signal outside in my backyard using my laptop.
4,D-Link Draft-N router works great.,"Updated router to use both Draft 802.11n and 802.11G. As stated in instruction pamphlet, I needed to download updated drivers for Windows Vista from D-Links website. After installing the new drivers and included software, everything has worked great. Signals improved and I no longer have intermittent loss of signal from older 802.11G router. Has been working well with both G and draft N signals."
5,D-Link DIR-625,"Excellent wireless router! Nice to have backward compatible to support varies wireless devices in my home office and household. The signal strength is great and I get no dropped connections for internet gaming, voip, video streaming, audio streaming and browsing the internet. Very fast and reliable networking. Lastly the fit to finish of wireless router is excellent. I recommend the purchase of this router."
5,nice router,"good enough for me. i just use my internet for email, video and some downloading. it's fast enough. but range wise, seems that you'd need a straight shot between the computer and the router, or close enough to get the full signal...overall no complaints. drops connection once in a long while, so a restart is needed. but what router doesn't do that? at least all the ones i've used...."
5,Excellent,I've had very good luck with this router so far; the setup was simple enough the web-based management is fairly robust in comparison with other brands. A lot of advanced features are included in this router as well. I'm using it to route a satellite internet connection and I have not had any difficulties.
3,Less range than expected,"While inexpensive, this D-Link router just doesn't deliver the range that the Belkin pre-N router it replaced delivered. I'm getting about 50-75 feet of coverage. The product shipped quickly (3 business days to Florida). The setup disk is very simple and worked on the first try. When linking with the modem and other wireless appliances, the security code is the one that comes with the router, and not your security password."
4,so far so good,"I have had this router for a month now. So far so good. I have a MAC, so the set up wasn't exactly easy... that's why I didn't give 5 starts."
3,Easy to set up and works great! SecureSpot ruins it.,"Just took a few minutes to set up with the shareware setup program. Not only gets you connected, but also helps you get tight security. Also an outstanding price! Highly recommended.Edit: I tried the 30 day trial of SecureSpot then dropped it and two years later still have conflicts with it. Malware built into the router and dlink does nothing about it. Do a net search for SecureSpot problems and you'll find hundreds of threads about this problem."
1,Weak Signal to Wireless G devices,"If you are looking for a wireless router that improves signal strength to your wireless g devices, don't get this router. Do not believe DLink's sales literature on this router saying that it improves signal to wireless g devices. After 2 hours on the phone with DLink tech support (including second tier)they finally confessed that this router does not perform any better than a wireless g router when talking to wireless g devices. DLink is falsely advertising the capabilities of this product. I won't buy another product from them again."
2,Unstable Performance,"Installation is easy,I like the Network magic software but I think its claimed wireless speed is a lie.I tried with D-Link Rangebooster N 650 adapter(DWA645).After I reboot the router,speed stay high for while then slows down over the time.Even LAN speed is very slow, slower than my old router (Netgear Rangemax WPN824).Sometimes, signal just drops and get disconnected.Wireless speed G or N is horribly slow.I already tried in many ways and I am really dissapointed with its unstable performance."
3,"great product, but wait until you want to secure your network...","A slim, sleek, reasonably compact device with very acceptable range and good overall performance. It installed like a dream, until it came time to secure my wireless network - a network of a single laptop, mind you. No way one can do it without having to call tech support. And it took several long tech phone calls over different days and a variety of solutions for it to finally work properly and fully. On the plus side, I always got a tech fairly quickly and they did have a reference from prior calls. On the minus side, one time I got disconnected and they never called back even though they had my number, so I had to start over. Also, it took at least three or four different tries/solutions to finally get it right. In retrospect, it was a good thing I did get disconnected, it was that last call that did it!"
1,Do not buy this one,"This product come with old version of firmware. Upgradeunsuccess. The technical support is very poor, lacking ofBasic knowledge."
4,WORKS GREAT BUT NEEDED SOME TECH HELP,"The D-link DIR 625 works as advertised. I needed some tech help since my dsl modem was not compatablie with the D link, but the tech was very helpful, and helped me through the modifications needed to complete the set up. I am very satisfied with the D-Link router."
4,They got it right,"I bought this router to replace my DI-524, only because I wanted to upgrade to N standard. The router is extremely easy to setup, never had any hiccups (I'm using it for the last 15 months), it is turned on for the last couple of months without any connection problems, the range is not bad, but could be better. When I go to the second floor of my house, the signal drops to app. 40% which is enough for me. You won't make a mistake if you buy it."
4,Great Router,"it's a great wireless router, never seen dropped or I never need to reboot.range is great for town house. You could also put additional antenna if you need.Setup is not difficult, it is just different then the others. if is your first router you might going to spent some time on it. if you don't know about computers you must use help.I spend 2 hours to find the mac filter but I couldn't find it, I asked my brother and he told me that sometimes it is not the mac filter it could be network filter. After then it took me like 5 minutes to set it up.if you need wireless network security use mac filter, it is a lot simpler and secure."
3,Unable to make wireless file sharing work,Bought to replace a D-link 614+. Everything worked except that I was unable to get file sharing work across wireless connection. It worked OK if a hardwire connection. After about 8 hours of messing around with it I gave up and went back to the 614+ which is slow but wireless file sharing works perfectly. If you are not using wireles file sharing everything else seemed to work OK
1,The cause of my Internet connection flakiness,"I bought this router about 8 months ago (in May 2008). The one I have is a rev. C (still the current model). Since I got it, I'd occasionally had problems with my Internet connection not working for a few minutes to up to an hour; I thought it was Comcast's problem based on some simple network diagnostics.However, I realized at some point that the desktop computer that I rarely use, and which is plugged into the wired network port, was still connected just fine even when my laptop was unable to connect to the Internet (although the laptop could connect to the router just fine, e.g., to change the router's configuration).So there's something wrong with this router. I tried upgrading the firmware, and changing a whole bunch of configuration options, but nothing helped."
1,USB port on router doen't function,"After buying and installing this router, the USB port for printers, MFP, scanners or storage devices did NOT function properly. Overall everything else worked, but I needed all four ports for computers and the usb port for the all in one printer.Spoke with D-link at length, and I agree with other reviews that d-links support is some what useless. I was told they have had a lot of problems with the DIR-625 and I should return it and get the DIR-628. (thank you d-flunk for your more expensive solution)"
4,It Works Great,"D-Link DIR-625 RangeBooster N Router Wireless Draft 802.11n with 2 AntennasIt works great with few problems. It sends out a strong signal throughout my house and it works great. I did have to download updated firmware from D-Link for it to work properly. Also, the WEP encryption would not work with my Windows Vista computer. But the WPA encryption has worked fine. I understand that the WPA encryption is supposed to be better anyway. Just make sure that the wireless adapters on your computers and other hardware support WPA encryption if you have Windows Vista."
3,SecureSpot does not work on DIR-625 !!!,"Although advertised as such in the product description, SecureSpot is not compatible with the DIR-625, but the DIR-625 Rev C. SecureSpot was the main reason for me buying this router.It is better than my years-old netgear box and combined with OpenDNS, I have a some parental control but I really wanted a router-based solution with individual user scheduling. Maybe one day."
3,Performance D-Link 4 Port wireless router,Everything works fine instalation disk really simplifies the job of installation. Was quite disapoined in the so called increased range. I got no better range or speed than an older wirless modem which I have had over 5 years
1,"function broken, and tech support doesn't know what I am talking about","doesn't work with my wireless TV receiving box, though a DI-524 works fine. Looks like a known problem when googled the problem, but the tech support from D-Link doesn't know what s/he is talking about by just sending totally unrelated diag/fix info. Wanted to return the product but was too busy in the holiday season to do that."
1,Never received,"When the USPS number was given to Me it was never reqognized by them as being a valid shipping number..When I was finally able to find the phone number to call Amazon,they treated Me with respect,and refunded my money promptly..I will purchase products from Amazon again"
2,Save your money. Dont buy,I got this and the RangeBooster is a lie. It has NOT boosted any kind of range on my network. It also goes in and out of service often. I wasted my money on this one.
5,"Easy to use, easy to setup wireless router","I own the big brother to this router, the DIR-655. I bought this model for my girlfriend's parents for Christmas because they were limping along on a B network. I went with this model because it was the least expensive N model with the QoS (Quality of Service) engine, which prioritizes packet traffic based on their time sensitivity (e.g. VOIP and gaming packets are given a higher priority over, say, internet browsing packets). After plugging it in, I had it tuned within 20 minutes and my girlfriend's mother's laptop connected in another 5. What can I say? If you're accustomed to the D-Link router setup, this one's a breeze. And that initial 20 minutes? That included downloading the latest firmware update for it and applying it. Gotta' love that!"
4,"Excelent router..., difficult to establish the wireless network","The wireless net this Router creates its fantastic, at least for home use. I had some problems to establish the wireless connection to my laptop. In fact, I do not know how exactly it started to work well. So far now, the wireless network is working nice."
1,Pathetic - don't waste your money,"This router has a number of issues. Part of it maybe because I have some PCs running Win XP and others running Win 7. However, no such issues with other routers, including my 7 year old Belkin.Signal is weak - even in an apartment. PC does not connect easily to router - shows message ""acquiring wireless signal"" and just stays in that mode. Have ended up wasting a ton of time configuring and trying to get this to work. Tech support is also not able to help. Replaced it with a $10 router from Verizon that has been great.Definitely the worst router out there - stay away!!"
3,Wireless Router,It's just an OK wireless router. The setup was easy but the distance / range is just OK
4,Tight and fast,"I actually bought this to use as a wired router with another Access Point so I can't comment on its own wireless. I used it to replace an aging Dlink wireless G router from 4 years ago and found this one bulletproof and way faster though ethernet. The GUI is fast and doesn't get hung or do weird resets at time like some other routers. I am pleased with this unit, appears well built."
4,N Wireless Router,A good product for my purposes. I used it in in a wired network to give me wireless access to the network. It is a little difficult to set up and the instructions are somewhat confusing. But after it was set up it worked great and was bought at a good price. I have not run into any problems with it so far. I would have given it 5 stars if it had not been for the setup confusion.
5,Best Router Ever!!! - Not Kidding,This router is probably one of the best i've used. The only reason it would get less than 5 stars is if you didn't know the difference between a cable modem and a router (that's how easy setup is.) I bought this mainly for gaming (Xbox 360) and it has worked flawlessly even with WPA protection up (no lag i mean whatsoever!) Also if paired up with VTA-VR phone adpater you can have a VoiP phone connection. I highly reccomend this router to anybody for everything they could possibly need. (except for streaming HD movies which only $250+ routers could only think of doing)
1,Requires frequent reboots,"This router just... stops routing after a while (usually every 1-2 days, but sometimes several times a day).After over a year, I'm giving up. I'll find something else that actually works reliably."
4,Good,"Pros:The Installation went easily and there are no problems with it till now.Cons: When it is used in the 'n' mode but when it is used in the backward compatibility 'g' mode, the difference in speed is very high."
1,Tech support STINKS!,"I just returned this router after 1.5 hours on the phone with D-Link 'Tech support'. What an absolute waste of my evening that was! I do think the router would have eventually worked if tech support could have a: spoken a form of English I could have understood and b: known what to suggest when I told them the Firewall/Windows setup was causing the problem. Unless you are a computer jock or have 3 hours to spend on the phone don't bother with this router. I had my Linksys Wireless G running in under 5 minutes, with no drops. I don't even want to give this one star!"
3,DLink Dir 625 RangeBooster N Router Wireless,"The product was easy to set up and configure. For the price, it is not a bad solution. But if you need a stronger or farther range, I would not recommend this product,"
1,Not ready for N technology,"I was unable to install this product. I ultimately tried 3 separate computers and 2 different modems. After trying everything he could think of the D-Link support technician said to return the router as defective. Even with D-Link tech support and ISP tech support the replacement router could not be installed and again I was advised to return it as defective.A computer savy friend advised me to order a ""G"" router rather than a ""N"". The G router installed without difficulty and is working great."
2,Wireless b/g/n router,"Signal is choppy when on B/G, fast when on N. I also purcased a $30 security but it did not activate, it's always asking me to purchase it, very annoying. Will not recommend to anybody."
4,"pretty good, once i got it working","my 1st wireless router and its got good signal strength, internet is just as fast as if it were wired. easy to install, at first. then something got screwed up (maybe i changed the settings or something, i dont know) and it wouldnt connect correctly. after a couple nights trying to fix it (including a wasted call to tech support) i got it working well, now. thought i might have to retun it, but, think i'll keep it. good price & does a nice job."
4,Very Good Router,This router was easy to set up. It has a excellent range. To date I have never lost a signal with this router. Highly recommend this unit.
4,I like it but...,"I gives you a great sense of security and protection. So protected are we that the firewall does not allow any messenger to get through it. Therefore I can't chat (snif!) And since I'm just starting to get to know this product I do not want to open ports (UDP or TCP in an indiscriminate way.If you like the basic 101 configuration it works just fine. If you want to costumize it, that's a different story."
2,Only worked while new,"Poor quality router, that had to be reset every once and a while. When it worked speeds were ok, but range rather short and then it stopped working altogether after 18 months."
3,Nice product !!!!! but with a trick!!!!!,The product is great ......i bought it to share a printer in my network because thats what the advertisement says. To my surprise when i tried to share my printer it didn't work because the old models don't have this capability. This is just for newest models........ i just think this should be brought to buyers attention .................
2,Look elsewhere for 802.11n,"This router seemed like everything I wanted. There was just one issue -- the wireless signal was intermittent and dropped out frequently. There seemed to be no setting I could adjust, no frequency I could change, no location I could use in order to make this router work well. While I had high hopes for it and found the system easy to set up, I cannot recommend this router. This lack of dependability seems to be a common theme in 802.11n routers, if one reads the reviews on Amazon. After buying this router, I bought a ZyXEL NBG420N and have nothing but good things to say about it. So, not all is lost..."
2,"Mediocre, Much better options out there","Constant dropouts that last approx. 5-10 seconds. I have to login to a VPN, so these dropouts are VERY irritating. But when the router isn't dropping out, it works very well. Overall though, these dropouts are too often, and are unacceptable."
1,D Link DIR 615 router,"I will never buy another D Link product. I have spent 2 weeks trying to get this router diagnosed and working right. I is new, but intermittently drops off line. My many hours was not helped by the awful (cant even get through on the phone to tech support - NONE. Online support was a little better). Very bad support/ unreliable product."
3,decent archival footage - but what's with the waltzes?!,"This DVD contains archival footage (as is the case with many Rising Sun Productions DVDs) of General Choi and others performing I.T.F. Taekwondo forms, techniques, etc. The footage has not been cleaned up in any way, thus the image quality is what you'd expect for 40 year old film. That I can handle - but who decided to use waltzes for the entire audio track????? I don't know what music would have matched the movements, but the waltzes just don't cut it for me... it's too incongruous. I had to turn down the sound to finish the DVD.I think there is tremendous value in preserving this type of footage on DVD; Don Warrener and Rising Sun are to be commended for these efforts. It would be great if it could be digitally cleaned a bit (admittedly an expensive proposition for material with a such limited appeal, so I suspect it will never happen) and if it had more appropriate music."
1,Put me to sleep,"I had been studying Tae Kwon Do for about 8 months as I eagerly awaited this dvd (which looked home made when I recieved it.) I was disappointed with what I bought. The footage is extremley grainy, the sound is poor/ (music?) and I was foolish enough to think I would benefit from viewing this. Well I did learn something about myself. Dont act impulsivley.There must be better footage than this. My opinion is that this dvdr is not worth the s&h I payed"
2,Bad bg music ruins every thing!,"Ok,i saw this dvd for 20minutes,and i fell sleep right away!why? because background music is so boring that makes yousleep right away... I like all the forms,but i notice thattheir forms seems to me came from shotokan karate katas.i know that general choi said he studied karate in japan,but he never mention which style of karate! I think he is nothonest person,because he make storys about Takkyon and himself.. But as far as i know Taekwondo and Takkyon don't share anything common..."
5,Awesome music,I bought this as a gift for a friend and she loves it she plays it often.. It came super fast too excellent quality item highly recommend dealing with this seller
5,as described,"I surprised how its great lens, clean, with protector, and sharp. actually i chose this lens for underwater photography, but when I try it in my background to take pictures for small bugs I discover this wonderful lens.thank you for your services"
4,Macro review,"Very easy to use. The auto focus some times is an issue but you can switch to manual and get the picture you want. The image quality is great, I was able to catch bees in flight with a rapid fire setting and AF and the result was spectacular."
5,Canon Lens,"This is my third Canon specific lens for my two EOS units. It is easy to ues, a no brainer, and I love everything about it so far. I've had NO problems whatsoever and can recommend it highly to anyone interested in purchasing one like it."
