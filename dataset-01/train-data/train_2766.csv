2,Not the best of Fujifilm!,"I bought this camera recently because I was pleased with the pictures of an older version of this camera. I was looking for something lighter in weight, that would take less batteries, take great pictures and fit in my bag. Well, this camera is lighter in weight, uses less batteries, and is smaller is size. However, I just returned this camera to Amazon because it is so cheap! The picture quality (which was the most important aspect to me) was horrible! They were dark with a blue tint not matter how much I adjusted the wb or other features. There were a few outdoor picture I took that turned out well but other than that the overall quality of the pictures were unsatisfactory. Also, the camera casing itself is plastic and seems like it would break very easily. The camera is smaller but thicker. It does take only two batteries but in the month that I had it used up 8 batteries! I would not recommend this camera to anyone."
5,Fuji FinePix A205,"This is a great camera !!!!!!!!! This takes great crisp,clear pictures . Some people say it eats batteries but it doesn't .It is the best digital camera you can have . I also like the zoom feature . All in all this is a great camera ."
1,A really bad chose,"I have goten this camera as a gift and it lasted less than a year!! i change battiers, camera card and now it won't turn on! IT""S A WASTE OF MONEY!! it's not worte it."
3,BATTERY EATER!!!,Its a decent camera but it EATS batteries... LIKE CRAZY and the buttons go nuts sometimes.I got this for free with my dell laptop so i cant complain that much
1,Nice package - poor reliability,"I've had two of these cameras, both lost their ability to focus after 11-13 months of use (no drops or any extreme use). They aren't dirty or abused, the simply loose track of where the lens is (the computer moves it in and out to focus) and every (yes every) shot is blurred.I'd recommend another camera."
5,Fantastic Camera!!,"It's simple to operate, takes fantastic pictures, and is extremely portable. I have a fancier Fuji digital that's also wonderful, but I wind up using this one more than the other simply because it's so easy to use. I carried it in my fanny pack all over Disney World for four days and it was so wonderful to be able to whip it out and get quick pictures whenever necessary. It's on and focused within seconds. Never a missed shot. I can't recommend it highly enough."
2,Does what it i suppose to,It is a very simple camera that anyone can use. But it is not fancy and high-tech. It does what it is suppose to do.
1,Buy something better than this,"It worked ok for awhile, but then the colors turned weird and my pictures looked horrible. Like someone else posted, shooting video with it is useless unless your subjects are outdoors or under spotlights."
5,Great recipes!,I am satisfied with this book as well as it arrival time. You can't find these recipes just anywhere. I am glad I found it.
3,I stole stories from this book and used them as my own,"But that was way back in 2000 when I was 22, and an out of work web designer in London. I hunted this book down for years, but couldnt quite remember the title.. and now I am less impressed. It seemed really dark and droll. Maybe I was more goth in my recent youth.."
2,Forsaken,"This collection of short stories was less than stellar. The writing was simplistic and obnoxious, with no purpose or irony to any of the stories. Everyone is so impressed with the fact that his stories are `true' - I'm trying hard to figure out why blatantly writing about everyday situations-i.e., being forced to interact with losers on a daily basis - is suddenly innovative art. The self-deprecating characters did a good job of observing how life sucks-something I easily do myself everyday within my own mind or via conversation with other disillusioned people. These stories left me dry, empty, and disappointed that I wasted both my precious time and money.Admittedly, I did laugh a few times-so I guess all was not forsaken."
2,Bad sound quality,The sound is distorted both ways (in and out). It's hard to remove it fast from the carrying pocket.
1,Cheap knock-off,"I bought this exact same item from someone a few months ago. It worked great, had no complaints from anyone about the reception on the other end. When i lost the head unit i came online and bought the exact same item, however, when it arrived i noticed a few little differences between the accessories from my old headset and the accessories with the new one. People also immediately began complaining about the extremely poor audio quality. I would not recommend that you purchase this item online even from someone with a good seller rating. For items like this you probably want to buy straight from an established retailer."
4,Good earphone,"I use this to go with a treo 700w, and now a blackberry. It is small and light. Sound is good. I like the battery recharge option most. I also like the fact it has several adapters so I can minimize the number of adapters I have to keep and carry. I wear glasses so there is no ear hook interfering with the glasses. Occasionally while driving, the other party complain about the ambient noise but somehow it does not happen all the time. I never had other blue tooth headset before so this is not a comparison.Be careful however, with the similar product numbers Plantronics use. A coworker bought another 640(??) and turned out that one does not have all the adapters."
1,sounds lousy w/ treo 650,Very disappointed with this device. It usually sounds crackly and fuzzy - hard to get clear reception. Doesn't matter if I am right next to my phone or within 30 feet.
3,"Good Size, but picks up everything","I bought this on the recommendation of a friend.It is a great size (lightweight) and comfortable. I use it with my blackberry and it works great. My only complaint is that the mic is so sensitive it picks up a lot of external noise (road noise). I've had several people tell me it's very loud. They can hear me pretty well but I also had a few tell me they could hear me running over the ""cracks"" in the highway (I'm driving an economy car, so perhaps a high end car with more noise control would help).Works great in other situations, but I really wanted it for the car. I'm a bit disappointed"
4,Good but,"This is an excellent hearset but, when the wind is blowing you get alot of interference. The reason you hear so much better from this earset versus others is because the ear piece molds to the shape of your ear to block out all other sounds. Its seems as if the earpiece has a microphone built in which picks up the noise from the wind blowing. The charge doesn't last but two days but I do like the conviencence of the dual charger."
2,Handsfree,"I am not satisfied with this product because the loop attachment for the ear is extremely flimsy and the ear plugs are very fragile to insert. I broke the first plug setting bluetooth up. It is not well put together and feels like it will fall apart in my ear. Other than that, it works well, holds the charge and turns on and off easily."
4,good deal for the price,works mostly without excess noise but sometimes too crackly to hear. Good value though
3,'s okay,"I've had a Motorola Bluetooth since January. I've only had to charge it once every three weeks! It's awesome that way. However, the earpiece broke on one side so it would fall off now and then. Hate the earpiece. THUS, I went and bought the Plantornics 640e. I love the earbud. Comfy and light. I HATE the battery charge. I have to charge it every day. A huge change from being spoiled by the charge life of my Motorola bluetooth. Somewhere there's a bluetooth with a happy median. Someone let me know where. :)"
2,Plantronics Discovery 640E with LG Phone,"The biggest problem that I have with it is that the button command has a delay with the phone. When I press the button to activate voice command, it would not accept the first command and tells me that it did not recognize any voices and tells me to try again. That is what I use the most with my bluetooth and that is why I gave it a low rating. I got another bluetooth and this will be use as a backup."
3,Bluetooth Headset looses connectivity at 4 ft,The delivery from Amazon came in on time.The product itself was not working as stated. I could only have a noise-free conversation (in a quiet room) if I held up my cellphone close to the headset in my ear.The headset itself wears very comfortably.I will be returning the headset for replacemnet.
1,Bluetooth headset falls apart easily!,"Although I did not purchase this bluetooth headset from Amazon (used a local cellular retailer), I felt compelled to write a review just to warn others that this product is not worth buying. Here are my complaints:(1) Gel ear buds DO NOT STAY ON (now I've lost all of them), and neither does the over-ear hook.(2) Headset does not stay in, regardless of earbud chosen or whether or not I used the over-ear hook.(3) Does not stay charged through one long phone call.(4) People on the ""other end"" complained of a lot of noise and echo (no noise cancelling technology, apparently).Again, my BIGGEST complaint is that this thing constantly comes apart. I've had it sort of settled in my ear and, while talking and sitting still, the earbud or hook will fall off and the headset drops to the floor. I find this product extremely frustrating, and I'm sorry I bought it and kept it too long to return it.Don't waste your time and money!"
2,"Good on Motorola Pink Razr, Bad on IPhone 3G",The attachment design of the ear piece is flimsy. It can come apart very easily & you can lose the bluetooth if not careful. I am not keeping mine.
1,Terrible sound quality.,"When using this I have a ton of interference in the form of cracks, pops, and hisses. It sounds like I'm out of range, even when I'm within a foot of my phone. Very annoying.Also, the battery charging thing is retarded. My advice to Plantronics: just make a regular wall charger that plugs into the device and stop trying to be cute with all of these clip on gadgets. If you want to make something useful make a dock of some sort so this isn't loose on my desk all day."
3,"OK, but not very good.",Got this device because I'm a junkie for technology but determined after about two weeks that it wasn't going to be as versatile as I needed. Wasn't very good at all in noisy situations. It just didn't fit my lifestyle so I'm looking again for one that will do better. Doesn't anyone make one that will be versatile enough to handle outdoor activities like my softball tournaments and then change to normal indoor activities and you still can't hear. Did not like it and ended up giving it away.
3,Lifespan may be 1 year,"Lifespan could be only 1 year. I used it very well but with very good care. Never got it dropped on the floor or physically damaged it. But still after a year the people on the other side of phone started complaining that voice is very low. If I increase the volume, I am hearing them unbearably loud.Just a week back the main button on the bluetooth stopped working. I couldn't press it anymore. It's charging well and good but can't use it anymore.I liked the synthetic / rubber earpiece of this. You don't need to hang it around the ear. You can just press this into ear and design is good."
3,Clumsy product,"While it came in a good package, I suddenly found there were too many parts to deal with. And, everything seemed rather delicate and flimsy. Had a tough time figuring out which ear piece woudl be ideal for my ear. Never felt secure about the headset staying in my ear.There are better, more secure head sets from Plantronics and others. This one is not worth it."
4,Good purchase,"In all a great product, sound is great, no problems with people hearing me on the other end. Only negative is that the ear piece falls off because not permanently attached, it always comes apart in my pocket/purse/etc."
2,not good as it should be,Ive had four bluetooth earpieces and This one fits very comfortable and is the the loudest one Ive used yet. Its good if you have a hearing problem. I drive alot and have alot of road noise. The only problem is your voice is not clear for the other person your talking to. It is distorted and people will ask you several times what you said. The best one Ive used yet is the plantronics 925 even though I'm not 100% satisfied about the way it fits in my ear it is very tolerable and It cancels background noise out very well. I like it alot better than the jawbone. The jawbone is huge and I cant turn the volume up loud enough to hear because it dont go far enough in my ear.
2,Not that great,"I found it difficult to hear on this device, plus it had so many parts to carry around. It was not very efficient to use with a battery and a wall charger. Therefore, I returned it."
3,"DO NOT BUY THIS ONE, buy the 640 NO E","I give a 3 because this product is confusing. Spend the extra 2 bucks and get the carry case, and all the extra charging adapters, so you can use your phone or your computer to charge your headset. As far as it falling off. It never has. I was worried at first, so I gave it a test. My glasses flew off before the headset even felt like it was going to go anywhere, however, I had a horrible headache after I shook my head that much. So take my word, if you get it in correctly it is not going to fall off. This headset can be a bit bad in noisy situations. I use mine to listen to music off of my laptop between calls from my cell phone! Get the noise canceling headset 645 if you're going to use it in a noisy place. But the 645 won't work with 2 devices at once, like the 640, the 645 requires you to re-connect. It is a trade off, so choose wisely. I would definately buy again, for price and comfort of the device."
3,Great bluetooth headset. Horrible charger.,"This headset works great with my Motorola Razr, but after 6 months of use, it started having problems charging. At first, I thought it was a problem with the internal battery, but it turns out to be the charging unit gets a bit loose after some use. I have to continuously fiddle with the positioning before the charging will ""stick""."
5,A great book!,"Just finished this book for my bookclub. I loved it! I would highly recommend it as a suggested bookclub read. I was immersed in the historical setting and found the characters moving and compelling. Although set in 1806, it is highly relevant to today's issues related to our judicial system and the insanity of a country, such as ours,in it's continued use of the death penalty. Anyone with Irish heritage, Catholic hertiage, an interest in history or simply a desire to be moved by a wonderful novel should read this book."
5,I'm Very Impressed!,"I don't know what type beans are used in this vanilla. Frankly, I don't care. This vanilla is KSA certified. I have tried many brands of vanilla. Morton and Bassett is the most flavorful I have ever tried. The price is reasonable for such clean flavor. Pure vanilla is expensive but there are other brands that are pricier and doesn't taste as superb as M&B. I am convinced this is the best pure vanilla you can find in the US. I do wish I knew what bean is used but maybe that's a trade secret. It's Kosher certified and that's good enough for me. I have searched for the perfect taste in a vanilla for many years. Thank you Morton and Bassett, my search is over! Now I can enjoy a vanilla taste that is pure and smooth. I am very happy to have found this vanilla extract."
3,pricey and disagreeably packaged,"Three bottles are shrinkwrapped together so they may not arrive intact. I ordered this most expensive option ($29.64) because it gave the clearest ingredient list. Other brands included water and sugar. However, there is no advisement regarding whether this is Madagascar, Tahitian or Mexican in origin. Vanilla is more expensive than gasoline!$2.47/oz = $316.16/gallonAmazon's customer service continues to be accommodating when I complained but the replacement vanilla was even LEAKIER. They offered a discount so I'm happy but what a waste of precious vanilla.A bottle cap in the second shipment was crushed.This compares favorably to my second experience with bad supermarket pricing of McCormick's brand spices. Their vanilla is on sale for $7 for 2 ounces."
1,Story Good- The Publisher should be ashamed,"I was very excited about reading Phoebe Deane, as I had just recently finished reading the first of Grace Livingston Hill's Miranda Trilogy. The story is a good inspirational read, perhaps a little old fashioned, but then I love old books. The Publisher, however, should be ashamed at the quality of this book. There were at least 10 mispelled words per page, which could be humorous at times but I often womdered if perhaps the book was in written in some kind of secret code that I could not decipher."
1,I ordered wrong part,"I ordered the wrong part and returned it. I hope it will be replaced, although the fault was mine."
1,Buy Locally,I did my homework on this memory including testing the same memory from another manufacturerAmazon's price was compelling - but the memory didn't workSo I bought memory locally to be able to return it if necessaryThe kbyte memory worked just fineI'll hesitate before choosing PNY memory againGood luck to my brother geeks
5,PNY 256MB DIMM PC133 - Great in HP xt926 Computers!,"After reading dire warnings in the comments about processors running under 1GHz not being able to use these chips, I went to the HP web site, checked out the specs for the xt926 computer that I am using and found that according to HP, the 133 would work just fine. I returned to Amazon, ordered two of the DIMMs, received them much sooner than expected, installed them in 10 minutes, and couldn't be happier with my upgrade."
5,I'll remember you,The product arrived in a timely manner and in fine shape. I'll remember this vendor for next time.
3,Call PNY Tech Help FIRST!!!,went to pny website to determine the correct memory to use. Used the configurator online.... told me to use this memory. Would not work... called pny tech... said configurator was wrong and to use PC100 for my machine. Told tech configurator shows PC133... said configurator is not always correct... sent back and reordered Kingston... no problems with Kingston PC133.I strongly recommend you call tech support before ordering PNY memory to minimize delays
4,Works wonders!,"I purchased this from Amazon a while back and I have always been meaning to upgrade my memory. I purchased a Compaq 5310US in December of 2001 and it was a little after the time that Windows XP was released, so hardware in computers was reliable, but not sufficient to what would be coming in the next few years. I have upgraded my Compaq PC to the hardware standards to this date. The last thing I did was upgrade the RAM in it. Once I installed it, turned on my machine. I immediately saw a difference. I noticed that boot times are quicker, desktop loading is quicker, and more programs can be run without computer slow-downs.I recommend this if you are looking to start upgrading your computer."
3,I think 256S100 is the right choice,"I brought this memory on the recommendation of Reviewer: R. Geissman ""rlgeissman"" (Lodi, OH United States). I have an E-machine T1300 1.3 GHz Celeron system that is a step up from the E-machine T1220 and the memory only reads at half the capacity. Instead of the chip reading 256mb it only shows 128mb. I had used the PNY Configurator that indicated that I should use 256S100 but R. Geissman recommendation was too strong to pass up. Well, I must say a lesson learned. No hard feelings R. Geissman. I'm going to order the PNY 256S100 and see will it do the trick. I hope this review helps someone who has an E-machine of this model."
1,Think before you buy,"I bought this memory from amazon.com and installed in my Dell Dimension L series 866MHz PC. This computer has already a 128 MB DIMM PC133 SDRAM installed in it. After installation, my computer showed only 144MB RAM. But when I installed the new (256MB) RAM, the computer showed 16MB RAM and did not boot because of lack of memory. I talked with the PNY technical support and they suggested me to return the product to amazon.com and to buy a 256MB PC100 SDRAM. The other thing is that when I checked with Dell support, they told me to buy PC133 SDRAM and PNY is suggesting to buy PC100 SDRAM. I don't know what should I do now to solve this issue."
4,Didn'y initially work,"Installed into Dell Optiplex GX150, originally had one 256Meg DIMM. Installed the PNY DIMM in the empty slot, and turned on computer - nothing happened, and it wouldn't boot. Removed PNY DIMM, and turned on computer, everything was fine. I then removed the DIMM that came with the Dell, and installed the PNY in that slot, and the original in the previously empty slot. Turned on computer, everything works fine now. Kinda weird, not sure why it behaved like that. Also, when in the second slot where it didn't work, noticed after I removed it that it was very warm on one side. Anyway, it works well now, but beware, it is fussy about which slot it goes into."
2,This memory is less for a reason.,"If you get this memory, be warned: your computer will crash more often. This is not top quality memory, and if you run a lot of memory intensive apps you will probably run into trouble. I would recommend this only for people who want more memory for games or other unimportant things, and who don't mind restarting every now and then."
5,i need some help,ok..this isn't really a review..but..i need help in finding out what kind of upgrade i need..i would like 256 mb of ram more on my hp pavilion a302x..i have windows xp and 248 mb of ram..but..i have no idea if this is the right upgrade for my computer..someone..help me!
5,Works...,"I had never updated memory in a computer before and was concerned about what to buy. In the end, I chose this which worked out great. The computer runs faster and I am able to do what I need to do without buying a whole new computer."
5,Great memory,I purchased this memory to double my computer's memmory and its great just opened my computer pluged it in and it was ready so easy to install and it will greatly increase your computing speed during such applications as video games but you need a computer from at least 2000 and its not compatible with PC100
5,512Mb works fine in my computer,Purchased two 256Mb modules for a Gateway E-3400 SE (year:2001 / P3 930MHz / WinXP SP2). Just installed and everything is working. System Properties correctly show 512Mb.Ordered with free shipping on Monday and received memory Wednesday!
1,Disappointment,Failed in 2 months. I bought this so I didn't have to reuse the 13 year old original one on a new fuel pump and have it fail a couple months later. Turns out this one failed in 2 months and now the 13 year old sensor is installed. Look for a better brand.
5,Great book!!!,"This is a great book for any aspiring filmmaker. A lot of people talk about making movies... Schmidt shows you how to ACTUALLY get out and do it.Big, Hollywood movies cost big, Hollywood cash.An independent filmmaker just can't afford to do things the ""studio"" way.Rick Schmidt tells you how to make a feature length movie with little or no cash.Just grab a camcorder, round up some friends, and make the damn thing.If it sucks... so what?Learn from your mistakes and make the next one better.This book will inspire you to quit talking about it and get out there and do it!Highly recommended!!!"
2,What a close minded author...,"Making movies is one of my hobbies. I was excited when I recieved this book as a gift, but was immediately turned off within the first couple of pages. Schmidt does some serious Hollywood bashing. Yes, some of Hollywood's movies are crappy, but it is unfair to say that all good films are indie films. This was the idea the book gave me. Then he goes on to bash O. Henry and Spielberg and his movie Shindler's List. No one does that. Ever. He is a great film maker. This is the finishing move: Schmidt goes on to say that plot has little to do with a movie, and that movies shouldn't be about telling stories. What the heck. What do you think movies are?It has some good advice, but the author should be shot for dissing on some of the world's best directors and authors."
2,"STOP KIDDING YOURSELF buy ""FROM REEL TO DEAL"" instead","Believe me, you do want to take the right aapproach to making your first film. Dont make a movie just for the sake of making a movie. Most people write crappy scripts, then make crappy micro budget films and call it art. ART? These guys are taking the experimental approach. Think about it. Only narrative work sells and people don't want to see how you feel but what can they get out of a clever story. I would focus mostly on organization and putting together the best script in the world. if you have that, everyone will come to you.And those of you who believe that they can make a film for $200 please let me know how crapy it came out. You need at least $20,000-$30,000 to make a digital feature. And if you dont pay anyone and your film sucks and your organization sucks, then everything else will fall apart guaranteed."
2,Ugh,"This was one of the most pretentious books I've ever read. Seriously. What I expected to be a guide to DV film making was really just an excuse for the author to push his own personal aesthetic, and I learned virtually nothing about the nuts and bolts of film making at all. If I wanted to know how to shoot Dogme 95 like a pretentious art-house irritant, I would buy a book on THAT rather than having to skip over an entire chapter of useless information. Plus for some reason he seems to assume that nobody already owns a computer, and includes an entire chapter on buying one. That was pretty weird too."
4,Excellent keyboard - good price,"I like it - it's quiet, easy to use, a snap to set up the quick-keys. And you can't beat the price. I'm on it all day and I find it easy and pleasant to use."
1,You'll be sorry,"I did not like this keyboard. For one thing if you want to use the function keys (F1-F12) you have to press a button on the keyboard every time you start your computer. Two, the keyboard sits relatively flat making all the keys the same height. It's especially bad on the bottom row where the Control, Windows key, Alt, and space bar keys are. Due to the design of the keyboard those keys actually appear to be higher than the row of keys above them. I can't tell you how many times I've gone to hit the SHIFT key and hit the Windows key instead. As far as the other features of the keyboard go I can't comment on them since I really only wanted a good basic keyboard. This wasn't it. I suggest to anyone thinking about purchasing a new keyboard to try it out first before buying it."
2,This keyboard is not very good,"While this keyboard is reasonably priced and seemed easy to type on, wound up returning it due to its quirky behavior. The F1 through F12 keys only work normally if the keyboard is in ""F-lock"" mode which you have to activate every tiem you turn the computer on. Otherwise these keys do another function specified by the software.I didn't like the software driver for this keyboard because it didn't let you set a fixed application for the media key to launch. Pressing the Media key brings up a MENU on screen where you have to pick what media player you want to open. I would have liked to program this button just to run Winamp when I hit it but no, the software was more complicated than it needs to be and wouldn't let me.If you're looking for a cheap keyboard I'd look for something else."
4,I like it!,"I use this keyboard at work and as I am a medical transcriptionist, it is all I use all day l o n g . . .I really like it and I'm going to buy one for my home as well. It is very easy to type on and I like the wrist support."
1,Does not work with Windows 7,"The truth is that I love this keyboard(in a way), but I hate that Logitech has chosen to discontinue this in WHITE which would be the best keyboard on the market, since it's hard to see the keys on the black keyboard in a home setting. HOWEVER,this keyboard no matter what you do will not work with Windows 7. You can read forums like I did.Try uninstalling this and installing that,but in the end I finally called Logigtech and asked them if there anyway in the Good Lord's green Earth I could make this work with my new computer. The answer, ""NO...it does not work with Windows 7""...<CLICK!> Is there anything left to say?"
3,not usb,"Wish I'd read the reviews. This is a PS/2 connection only so now I'm off to try to find a converter as the computer it is for does not have that connection. Hoping it's as good as other Logitech keyboards I've used in the past, but have to wait to test it."
2,defective,"First, I LIKE Logitec products. However, I connected this keyboard and found it would connect but when I typed, the letters would not show up. Because of the low price it will cost as much to return it as it is worth.I WILL buy another Locitech keyboard but in black and will try to find one like this one here in town. The only thing wrong with my original is that the letters have worn off some of the keys."
3,Keaboard,Priced at $1.50 whats the risk? The problem is the lettering on the keys is too small and hard to read. Compared with all my other keyboards it has much smaller letters. As I am a hunt and peck typer small letters are a big problem for me. Price was great and delivery was very good. As the price down to $1.50 I believe the offerer knew the problem. It works fine and has advanced features and for typers that don't look at keys its should be great. Troy Huggins
2,Tiny letters & numbers,"This keyboard has the tiniest letters & numbers on the keys that I've ever seen... and this old guy has gone through dozens of keyboards, dating back to the old clickity clack typewriters.Not everybody is a professional typist, & we need to see the letters to type. Older & vision impared people will have a problem with this keyboard... Like putting on reading glasses to see the keyboard, & then removing them or putting on another set of glasses to see the screen.Normally I like Logtech products, but what the heck where they thinking of by shrinking the letters & numbers so much? There's plenty of room on the keys! Use it!I had to switch back to my 8 dollar keyboard so I don't need any glasses at all to type or use the 'puter."
1,It's a stinker,"I've had several of these, and they lose all accuracy (and they seem to start with precious little) after a season, and even within one. I have put two side by side on my stove and they'll differ by 200 degrees Fahrenheit. I'm going to try a different brand."
5,Clean Burning Woodstove,Works great and installs in a second. You must have this tool to keep your woodstove burning at the optimum temperature to prevent creosote build up.
4,It reads like a superb novel!,"We all heard the ""news on speed"" sensationalist hype about Enron, et al. Mr Flanagan tells the real stories that the hype came from. And he kept my interest all the way through, which surprised me no end. His skillful literary references, the ""interviews with Mr. B,"" and the sheer storytelling make this business book as readable as any good novel. I wish all of Wall Street would read it!"
5,A classic,"Many books have been written criticizing the Catholic Church since the Second Vatican Council, but this one, besides being very well written, expresses a sense of sadness and loss about what was left behind in the Church's rush to modernize that few other writers have ever achieved. While she summarizes the struggles between liberals and conservatives in the US and Canadian Church very well the best parts, in my opinion, are when she writes about her personal experiences as a lonely faithful fighting against a relentless liberal bureaucracy bent on imposing its will despite what Vatican II actually wrote, what the pope has to say on the subject, or what individual lay people think. I have read it over and over - it's that good - and recommend this book to anybody interested in the subject. It was written in 1986 and updated a few years later, so by now it is a little obsolete."
1,Horrible set,"This was the single worst set I've ever used. If zero stars would be an option, that's what I would have chosen. The pot broke before we could even dunk a peice of bread into the cheese. While it was warming on the stand it came with, I heard a sickening crack, so I immediately (tried) to take the pot off the stand. The ENTIRE bottom of the pot had split away from the side...and cheese oozed everywhere on my counter top.Everything about this set is cheap. The pot (which was complete junk), down to the fondue forks it came with. They where metal with plastic. A complete waste of money.For your wallet's sake, save your money on this piece of junk and save up for a high quality set."
5,Nice product.,"Nice piece of work. It feels much better than theCanon LAH-DC20 Conversion Lens Adapter (LA-DC58E) and Hood (LH-DC40) Set for the S5 IS, S3 IS & S2 IS Digital Camerawhich feels flimsy"
4,Adapter ring,"By buying this step-down adapter ring I can still use my collection of Ambico filters although I got a new digital camera. A small purchase with big results.The dilevery of the item has to be send to Europe, but arrived within a couple of days!Great quality for both service and product.Highly recommmended"
1,lying company.....poor service,"previously, i purchased this product and gave it a neutral rating. someone from bower contacted me several times and begged me to change my rating. it is a step-down ring....what kind of rating does it really deserve? the representative from bower told me that i would receive another ring free, if i gave bower a better rating. i gave them a higher rating; bower did not deserve the higher rating, but they were willing to send a ring for free; so i gave them a higher rating. today, i changed that rating to one star. i changed the neutral rating several weeks ago, and i have not received anything from them. they lied to me. they are liars. do not purchase from this company."
1,Won't order from these people again,Never received this item. Adorama tried to ship this item via UPS to a Post Office Box. They refunded the cost of the item but never refunded the shipping cost. I feel they should know you can't ship UPS to a P.O Box. They have never tried to contact me about the shipping problem. If they had I could have given them my 911 address.
2,"Not bad, until it tore","Was a good buy and super cute! But shortly after my little sister got it, the hands and neck started tearing. And where it is tearing is really difficult to fix with a sewing kit. Really disappointed."
5,Gift,"My friend got me this for a present a few years ago and its sucker thing holds it onto my bedroom mirror perfectly. I just bought one for my friend and its perfect. She screamed and jumped up and down. If you like Inuyasha this is a great gift, I loved when I received my own. XD"
3,Nice gift,"I got this as a gift a few years ago and I loved it, mainly because I love this show. To be honest it's a little cheap...the hair feels like felt that can be bought in a craft store and the clothing feels cheap as well. The sword is flimsy but you get what you pay for. This is a nice displace piece, like to sit on a bed or shelve but not so nice to actually use."
3,Eh...,"This Inuyasha plush is incredibly cute, but he wasn't made very well, and I'm not the only one to have problems. His hair comes off and his sword is not stuck to him so well. He's very easy to damage. Still, he's just too cute to ignore, lol."
2,An attempt at something it is not.,"This is not a horrible book - it's just not a particularly good one either. The book did not engage me and I never found it particularly interesting or insightful. I had expected to learn something about Tibetan Buddhism, but I did not learn much.Swanson seems to want to mix the genre of travelogue with interspersed chapters that attempt to wax eloquently on Buddhism. I found that he was not particularly successful in this and as a result it made the book disjointed.This is a short book and a quick read, so you won't waste much time if you do decide to read it....I just don't think I would recommend it to my friends."
2,unsatisfying,"I was hooked by the jacket copy that said ""if you ever wanted to go to Tibet, now's your chance"" but was sorely disappointed. It is a thin book in every way, thin on substance, interest, detail, ideas. It's alternately pompous then aimless...the point of view is constantly ambivalent. Perhaps that is true to his experience, but it doesn't make for a good read. I'll keep searching for a real meaty travelogue of Tibet."
4,Anthem,"Anthem~ Darin is a very good debut album from the runner up of the Swedish version of Idol. The winner has like done nothing since he won the competition and now in hindsight I realize that Darin was a much more talented vocalist, artist and singer. Then again hindsight is 20/20. This album sounds a bit like Michael Jackson's album bad and a bit like R & B. ""Money for nothing"" is an awesome track and so is ""Why does it rain"". The book-let is a bit boring and he looks like he bought the outfit at H&M and that is not a good thing since H&M design is boring and tedious fashion. The photos are alright but they feel a bit boring and look like snapshots and the photo in the middle looks like shoddy photo shop work. Even so this album is very well done and it deserves 4 out 5 stars."
5,A touching collection of stories,"A good friend of mine mentioned ""The Happy Prince"" as one of his favorite stories which he'd seen on TV as a cartoon Christmas special some years ago.When I came across the book in a bookstore, my interest was piqued and I bought it up to take a look.As I read through the stories, the memories came back to me of the short cartoon skits I'd seen as a kid. The cartoons never hit me as heavily as the book did. The impact of these simple children's stories is remarkable and I found myself profoundly moved by the various characters acting out of love, devotion and their sense of ideals. ""The Happy Prince"", ""The Selfish Giant"" and ""The Nightingale and the Rose"" were especially touching.It isn't an easy job to write a story for children that carries over on another level when the reader is an adult, yet Oscar Wilde has done it with an entire collection. I'm very impressed and can recommend it to anyone."
4,Enjoyable read,I recently bought this on a lark - it's an enjoyable read & Wilde's style is perfectly suited for creative fairy tales.
3,its a decent wheel,"the wheel is ok, but the steering and gas and brake peals are unproportional. this wheel is the best one for gamecube though and is good. just don't use it to practice driving in real life or u'll be screwed."
5,Great vitamin C,"Have used this for one year. If you take one or two capsules a day. After one month this will keep the colds away. Read this on Prevention magazine, it really does work."
4,Indians won by Cruz,"I have not read this book for years, but while attemtping to find a book to have high school students read I thought of this one. It is an amazing stretch in alternative history, where a single event can be changed and the resultant reflection on society mapped. Briefly, after Custer was defeated at Little Big Horn, the Indian tribes stayed together to defeat General Crook and develop an Indian nation in the middle of the present US. This book is excellent for the manner in which it presents logical progressions and conclusions. Besides, the book is a very good read."
2,Not What I Expected,The book was good about each type lovebird but I really wanted more detail. I wanted more about Lovebirds and what their gestures and behaviors mean.
3,Very Nice Film,"The film is very nice and interesting. The quality of the box and disk are not.Nice shots of Wolverines and descriptions of them during the film, but the disc was completely scratched. I didn't complain since it played just fine, but the surface is completely scratched with tiny marks. Definitely not a new product although it was sold as one."
1,Demeaning and unimpressive,"This is the first book I read about the creationist/evolutionish disagreement. Sewell brings up some interesting topics on the creation of the universe, but he presents his thoughts in a way that are an attack on evolution. Talking about the ""propaganda"" and the ""so-called"" evolutionary truths (parens are his) just made his opinions less valid to me.I would not recommend this book."
2,"Logitech QuickCam for Notebooks, low quality construction",I'm very dissapointed about the QuickCam for NoteBooks.Its construction is very fragil to carry out with your laptop and requires too much light to get a sharp and colorful image.
1,Great Company [bad]Product,"Camera does not focus at closer distances. Picture is of low quality and color is terrible. Looks like something cooked up in lab and not ready for production. Their QuickCam 4000 is superb, though more expensive, it is fantastic and worth every penney. This camera, must use some old technology, though I don't know anything about it to have such lousy results. Either buy the QuickCam 4000 or keep your money in your pocket. Also, found that the lense rotates for some reason. Just weird thing."
3,alarm clock,"I was disappointed in the quality of the material used to make this clock. I bought it for my brother for Christmas, he is taking it to Antartica with him soon, I will be interested in how it performed there."
1,CHEAP METAL,This clock is made of cheap metal. I wound it up and the alarm won't ring because of the cheap metal.
5,Works great for us!,We got this for our camping experience. It was far more lightweight than I expected. Feels almost empty!! Case it fine and closes well. We had no problem in the time. Right for the beginning the time was perfect and we have not had to adjust it up or down (faster or slower). So we are happy with this clock. Pacing was great and delivery fast. We would gladly get another if we needed it.
4,Travel Alarm,Can't beat the quality for the price!! I've been looking for a Seth Thomas travel alarm but haven't been able to find one. I accidently came across this alarm in Amazon. Glad I did! Most inexpensive ones have an alarm that you can hardly hear. No problem waking up with this alarm!!
1,unreliable alarm,"Simply put, the alarm is unreliable. I tested it multiple times, and it usually didn't go off or only rang for an extremely brief time (between a split second and two seconds). One time I picked it up when it failed and then it started ringing! It seems like vibration from the alarm itself messes up the mechanism. Go with a higher quality, more expensive product."
2,Good concept - poor execution,"I wish I had been pleasantly surprised by the quality of the timepiece - no such luck. Even the face of this clock was badly done (numbers are arranged in unevenly and it looks like my 9-year-old kid could have designed a better clockface) - the case is made of very cheap plastic. I can't believe I paid 12 bucks for this thing. It is nice that it's wind-up and doesn't require batteries, but I am returning it for sure."
1,Overpriced piece of c***,I bought three of these units to supplement what I've been using for many years. As with many of the items we buy these days this product has turned to c***. Not only has the price skyrocketed but one of my units actually broke on me when I tried to wind it the first time.I'm stuck with these units but be aware before you make your own purchase.
1,Time runs fast gains more than an hour in one night,Wasted money on this. Had a similar clock that lasted 20+ years this was broken out of the box. Keep looking.
2,One unit arrived defective,"I ordered two units of this clock. One of them was defective (which Amazon has agree to replace) in that when I moved the alarm needle around, it triggered the alarm as expected but did not shut off when it moved past the current time."
1,"Sorry, but keep shopping.","Just purchased this 2 weeks ago but unfortunatley will be throwing it away tonight. Can't rely on alarm to go off- twice already I have just happened to hear a ""click"" when alarm was supposed to go off. Case was missing a small screw when I got it. Very light weight. Poor quality."
1,Garbage!,I bought this because it looked like my old Westclox travel alarm that I used for years and left in a hotel room. My advice to you is do yourself a favor and don't waste your time on this clock. The alarm doesn't last long and it gets weaker as the clock winds down and it winds down very quickly.I'll wind up throwing this piece of crap out. I'll stick to Westclocks travel alarms from now on.
2,Kinda Disapointed,Kind of cheaply made. Not what I would have expected from Amazon. Would not waste my money again on this product.
5,alarm clock,"This item was a gift for my mother in law, who travels quite a bit. She likes it a lot. She says that it does not have an irritating alarm and keeps good time."
2,Bad for windows 2000,"The installation on windows 2000 is difficult - you have to to install with CD first (this a ""plug & ooops, you should not have done that!"" design); and you have to cycle the power; and you have to do it all again after you plug the laptop into the dock; and it doesn't do some things right, so you have to uninstall it all, and redo it all, and 1/2 day is gone.After all that the video works, but the microphone does not. I've unistalled and re-installed, downloaded updates, etc. etc.The add-on image and movie sw also doesn't work (always finds the camera busy); although that usage is not a big deal to me it's still anyoing that it doesn't work.It also doesn't co-operate with the NetMeeting's Audio test (""The device does not have any volume controlls..."" -it does, but NetMeeting 3.01 doesn't find them)Perhaps it's windows 2000 and NetMeeting, perpahs it's Logitech, but at best I'll reluctantly keep the camera and use another microphone; in any case I wish I've got something else."
2,No features...,"No tripod mount, and no support for Win7 nor Mac OS 10,7in other words, and possibly waste of my money and time.of course since i also still run a Mac with system 9, a legacy version is appreciated."
3,one flaw with this cam!!!!,"Its a good cam for the money, the only problem is ,it will not stay on the stand ,keeps moving around falls off my pc. Its aggravating!!!!!"
1,Plug n Play sucks,"The software that comes with the webcam doesn't work at all and you've to download the updated software from logitech site. Also I found this hard way, this web cam doesn't work for Windows 2003. Logitech has no plans of providing drivers for Windows 2003. I'm hopeful that someday they will change their decision and provide drivers for Windows 2003. Looks like till then I've to login and logout of Windows XP whenever I've to use the webcam. Having said that the picture quality of this web cam is excellent. I would have given three stars if only the installation was also as smooth as the picture quality."
1,Quality of something that comes out of a gumball machine!,"The QuickZoom Cam works o.k., but it has the quality of something comes out of a gumball machine. Don't breath too hard or turn on a fan or the ball camera will fall out of it's stand. Impossible to keep it functioning in any kind of a working enviroment, other than a sterile laboratory where nothing is touched or moved. This product is way below par for it's price ...which is what I paid for it at a local store. Quality control must have been on vacation at Logitech for them to let this thing out the doors. Should be priced at ...as a 6 month disposable product."

4,Art Coloring Book with an Unexpected Education Twist,I love this coloring book because it features many famous drawings in black and white that we can color ourselves. Each piece has a brief history of the artist and artwork. A nice relaxing and educational way to color and learn! Another fun way to color the artwork is to look up the original painting and stride to color the drawings the same way! Kids of all ages can easily color each masterpiece and not even know they are learning something at the same time about our these Artists Giants!
4,great instant worksheets,I bought this book because I teach high school art and sometimes it is more fun to interact with the art by adding color yourself. :) I also use this to show that art is about decision making because all the students can start with the same drawing and still create vary different images. The facts are short and relevant and the artwork covers a variety of movements/genres.
4,Wonderful,"I just got this book.. very nice and informative, the paintings history and other information is inside but not included the original paintings , so I have no Idea what's the colors of the painting, atleast a thumbnail will do. Other than that it's a wonderful addition to my collections of art books. :-)"
3,"Competent, albeit unmemorable.","Undoubtedly well researched and competently presented, I was left with the wish that the author had leavened his work with an occasional touch of humor. Only my deep interest in English history kept me going to the end, especially through long descriptions of the activities of the king's household that could have cured insomnia. Considering the inglorious end to the reign of his son, Edward II, an epilog chapter to Edward I's biography would have been welcome, or at least more attention paid to the relationship between the latter and his heir."
2,More for History geeks than the casual reader,"I read this book as a followup to the excellent book on Robert Bruce by Ronald McNair Scott, since I figured it would be historically apropos. Though the volume contains many interesting facts, these are buried in minutiae that can be trying for any student of history. I found the book too expansive in its coverage, getting lost in the tedium of the administration of the kingdom, with in-depth detail of finances, land, titles, and minor characters. Rather than returning to the book often in eagerness to finish, I instead found myself trying to get in a chapter here and there more as a chore just to finish it so that I could go on to reading some of my other books. In short, I only recommend this book to someone that would relish the many, many details of a well-known English monarch from around the turn of the 13th century."
5,No Longer Music's frontman is an inspritation !,"This is one of my fave Christian books, as david writes with such honesty and warmth. His adventures in missionary work are astounding, and he makes us all give Thanks to God and be humble. David and his family have survived many harrowing and dangerous moments while spreading the Word of God, and this book is a very personal account of David's purpose and strength in the Lord."
4,6 solid mixes,"It's only the omission of the original full-length mix of ""Prix Choc"" that prevents this getting 5 stars (you can find it on the ""Super Discount"" album). It's simply a great track, with Cosmo Vitelli's drum'n'bass a head spinner and de Crecy's ""Ultra Dark"" dub splendour being possibly the best mixes."
3,Value for money,"Pretty good product for the price i paid , would have been better if the personalization was cost effect."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"The problem with being addicted to a drug, is that if your source goesaway, you are in big trouble. This is exactly what happens to the maincharacter here. Even more of a problem, on their dust filled world isthat it is extremely hazardous to attempt a journey to find more of it.This is what two drug fiends, a nutty captain and a crazy woman do, however."
4,Fascinating,"As you can imagine from the title, this book is for people who are fascinated with cruise ships or the industry and have a penchant for details. Not everyone needs to know that the Carnival Destiny was the largest cruise ship afloat- for less than a year. If you do though, this book is for you. There is equal parts of the history of each of the major cruise lines and the history of the ships they own and operate. The chapter near the end about the construction process is fascinating. If you are looking for tipping guidelines for the wait staff you have the wrong book. If you want to be the only person on your cruise that knows where you ship was built and its propulsion system, this book is a must."
4,Great ending,"This trilogy has captivated me from beginning to end. The battles were especially heart pounding. Excellent work. The first two were good, but this one blew me away. Lost too much sleep because of it.**A book I would also recommend is The Unsuspecting Mage by Brian S. Pratt. This, the first installment of The Morcyth Saga is a great beginning for a new author. Battles, magic, gods, secret passages and intrigue, all the elements of a classic epic fantasy! Any fantasy reader will enjoy it"
3,Okay ending to an okay series,Decent ending to the series. A quick and enjoyable read just like the others.There were a number of times where things just kind of happened because they needed to without any real explanation of how or why.
4,Fun adventure - easy read.,"I have read all of the WoW books I could get my hands on... and I have enjoyed almost all of them. This one was fun and a nice brainless read. I think I liked most WoW books so much because I spent 5 years of my life playing the game. Now, I'd rather read the lore than play so I find the novels a fun break from some of the more serious reading I do."
2,Poor Kindle translation,"This review is for the Kindle version only.The formatting of the Kindle version is atrocious. None of the paragraphs are indented and the only breaks are between chapters. When the scene shifts during a chapter, and with at least three plot threads this happens a lot, there are no breaks - not even a simple blank line.I returned this book and Amazon said they were going to pass on the feedback to the publisher. Hopefully this will be fixed soon, but just be aware when considering buying this for your Kindle."
3,Brotherly bickering and jelousy,I enjoyed what this revealed of the ancients that we encounter in the Firelands invasion in the game.it also gave me more insight into the various enemies we encounter from the burning crusade.But the shallow characters of Illian and a others connected to the burning crusade is rahter boring
5,Best Victorian Novel of Doubt,"MRS. Humphrey Ward (this is the reason why computers or computer programmers should not take over the world). Most of her books are just average, but THIS has been undeservedly forgotten. This is a disturbing, actually tragic (who could manage that these days?) story of a clergyman who lost his faith, and his struggle to find a new place in the world. It's very long, but, believe me, every page is worth it!"
4,Good for what it is,"If you need a small mouse,this is a top quality mouse. My only complaint is that the metal edges are a little sharp. I haven't cut myself yet, but I often feel like it is imminent."
1,DON'T BE FOOLED!,don't let them fool you by trying to charge you 20 bucks for this!!! i only paid 18 for this cd when it was included in the double disk set G Funk Classics almost 5 years ago.....shame on you all for trying to rob people!
5,If you know Ostad Elahi...,"If you know Ostad Elahi and have understood Ostad Elahi, then buy this book. You can discover his life whith a magnifient coolection of photograhies. I would have rated this book in 10 stars if I could."
4,20 Exitos: Mi Nina Bonita,"Order this product with the understanding that will arrive with in 7 to 10 days, needed the sogn for a father daughter wedding dance. I was surprice that it arrived with in the estimated time. very nice surprice, exellent transition"
1,err.....,this book is like many others and the characters emotions just don't speak to me. it seemed like a kind of uniform book. If you want GOOD end of the world themed books you should try the Fire-us trilogy.
4,"Funny, interesting, and a real ""Catcher""","This book was pretty cool. Once I picked it up, I really couldn't put it down(Except when the bell rang and I had to dash to the next class, that is.) There are two main characters, Jed and Marina. They are stuck up on a mountain, because their parent(s) belong to a nutty religious cult that believes that the world is going to end, and that the only way to be saved is to be on a certain mountain.It is written through the eyes of Jed and Marina(IE one chapter says ""Jed"", and the next says ""Marina"", and they explain the same thing, but through 2 different perspectives).It's really fun to read! Between Jed's humor and Marina's family problems, it is easy to stay into this book. It's great for about anyone 14 and older to read(anyone younger might not understand some of the parts). All in all, it kicks, so ya need to check it out!"
5,I've read it over and over again,"I enjoyed this book so much I've recommended it to all my friends. It has everything you could want in a book: romance, action, a more thought provoking serious side, and oh yeah, did I mention romance? After a while you even begin to think like the ""cult"" and see it from their point of view...but in the end the two main character, Marina and Jed, the only two who didn't go with the flow realize that they have gained a greater understanding of themselves."
3,cults and love?,"the plot of this story is very sketchy. it goes from the boy and dealing with his absent minded father and his point of veiw. then to the girl and her father leaving the family when the mother takes them to the mountain top. and then to the love that slowly grew between them without their notice and with both parents trying to interfear and prevent it. i can honestly say that i could have gone without reading this book. i was dissapointed after reading the dragon's blood trilogy then going to this. i was expecting more from her(and in my opinion, rightly so!) and was shocked at how the story progressed. i hope her next books are better planed and written!"
5,Fantastico!,"This book was an amazing read, I've been re-reading it for years. It has a compelling plot and the characters are realistic. This novel excels in the area of teen narrators and makes the story all the more believable. In the end, you really have to decide, who are the bad guys? It explores the world of grey in cults and their beliefs.If you liked this, try John Marsden's Tomorrow, when the War Began."
4,"Great book, good discription.",I thought this book was great. I think it was cool how theauthors took turns writting each chapter. I think if they made a moviehopefully would be good. But i would recommened this book to anyone who needs a book to read for school.
4,"""A definite page turner for medium sized readers""","This realistic-fiction story about believing brings two teenage lives together. Marina and Jed are brought up to Mt. Weeupcut by their relative(s) because they believe what Reverend Beelson has brought to everyone's minds... ""God is going to end the world on July 27!!"" Jed is dragged up by his father thinking this whole thing is bologna. On the other hand Marina is brought up the mountain by her mother but she's not sure shes believes too. While working in the camp and getting ready for Armageddon, they start to notice each other and become friends. But will they're friendship even last before the world ends."
3,it was okay,"well it was okay,i thought it would have been cool if the world would have ended,and a little bit more action!"
3,Didn't Catch my Attention,"I've read a lot of books! And this one probably the worst. It didn't interest me. I listend to the audio, and it didn't effect me more. IT was boring, The characters were ok, but I would have like to see more come between them, and more action. The authors are very well known authors, but this book shouldn't be on their best written!"
4,Great book for adolescent readers,"Marina and Jed, both from some-what troublesome families have fallen in love. Their love unites when they meet in the mountain camp of ""Believers"" who have gathered together to await the Armageddon, which is the end of mankind. In the final days, both Marina and Jed struggle with their lives and beliefs, along with the events that surround them."
2,Watch Out!!!,"The version that I got has 4 songs missing. Two from each album. Of course ""Free Ride"" had to be one of them. I hope that I can return it without any trouble."
2,"kinda yucky, even for a dehydrated meal","Ate this in Alaska after a long, long day of backpacking. It was cold and we were starving. Sort of time food usually tastes great no matter what. Not so much with this. It was warm, but that was the only good thing to say about it. Something about the chicken consistency was so beyond revolting. My poor husband had all he could do to keep from booting. We are no strangers to dehydrated backpacking food, but this was especially disappointing."
1,Horrible traduccióm,"Aunque la novela entretiene un poco, no pude evitar estar completamente distraida por los errores en la novela. La novela es una traduccion del ingles. No se como se atrevieron a publicar el trabajo de este traductor. Parece que lo tradujeron a traves de estas paginas web que traducen bien literal. ¡Que horror!"
4,Great Budget Mouse,"This is an excellent bargain-priced mouse, great for gaming and all around use. The only problem I've found is that if you have large hands, right-clicking is a little awkward until you adjust your finger position a little bit. Highly recommended!"
3,Decent mouse with a useless extra button,"This mouse is decent, but i wouldn't recommend the mouse for gamers. The clicking on the buttons are nice, but the mouse wheel is awful. It is so loud and clanking, it pisses me off. I would recommend the Logitech Dual Optical or Logitech Optical Blue. The extra button feature is used as a program switcher, but it is postiioned at above teh mouse and is useless, as clicking is less tiem consumming and tiring. Other than that, the mouse is decent for a little overpriced deal."
3,umm,this wrislet is ok...but it smells when you get it ...The bag must be washed multiple times before it smells remotely normal
4,"Good product , poor installation instructions","I am amazed that installation guide are sparse and inaccurate. It explains one case only and leaves rest to users imaginations.The assembly instructions are so poor that installation time is lengthened needlessly. I did read the instructions in polish and russian and my conclusions were exactly the same , Bad ,bad instructions!!"
1,Online Industrial Supply substitutes inferior sanding discs,"I purchased almost $100 worth of 5"" hook and loop sanding discs of various grits from this company and they substituted inferior discs with a handwritten note on the packing list saying upgrade discs substited. I wrote back and forth several times with their customer service and was blamed for having a Porter Cable sander that has a bad pad. The pad is new. I tried to explain but got no explaination or offer to refund and return, (which is what I asked for). Don't do buisness with this company because they will send what they want and their customer service isn't service its excuses. Ticked off Mel"
2,"5 Inch Hook & Loop Sanding Discs, 8 Holes, 100 Grit, Box of 50.","Everything would be fine but I didn't get what I ordered. Instead of ""Mirka"" sanding discs I got some other company's ( USA1 Abrasives) products which don't have numbers on the back indicating what grit they are and many of discs are glued to each other so when you try to separate them the glue stays on the sanding surface. I don't think I want to buy this products on Amazon any more."
5,Excelent baby shower gift,This was an absolute hit with the mother to be at the baby shower and with others as it was passed around. It was an added bonus to have a different resource book for sellecting baby's name.
1,We get the point already! Demson loves Barth & likes Frei!,"This is possibly the driest book that I have ever read, definitely drier then Kant, Lindbeck, or Frei himself. Basically Demson states that Frei does not have an adequate enough reading of Scripture, whereas Barth does. Barth suggests that it is impossible to read the Scriptures without understanding Jesus' relationship with the disciples. This is fine, but the problem with the book is that out of the 110 pages of writing, Demson only gives a few pages of his thoughts. 90% of this book is a meticulous reading of Barth's Church Dogmatics and Frei's Identity of Jesus Christ and Scripture itself. Plus, it is constant restatement that Frei does not discuss the disciples enough and how great Barth does with the disciples.This might be an adequate book if you are one who wants to read everything about Barth or Frei (of which I am one), but do not be surprised if you become disappointed."
5,I Laffed so hard I tink I sitt myself,"Dis iz da funniest fing I have ever heard in years, & I can really relate to dis cuz I love blowin' gas, & I even blow farts whilst listenin' to dis. Tunes such as ""Chubby Club"", ""You're My Favorite Turd"", ""Pucker & Smell"", ""Squishy Underwear"", ""I'm a Lonely Toilet"", ""A Fart Can Be a Friend"", ""Diarrhea '03"" & sketches such as ""Carl Needs a new Rod"" (If you fard near a blind person at a bait shop, you'll get da joke) & ""Duel at Del Santo's"" (very remeniscent of da famous late-'40's UK gem, ""The Farting Contest"") are so funny dat I laffed so hard I tink I sitt myself!!I've been a Yooper fan since high school & dis a great addition to my collection!"
2,Ehh,I bought this as a gift for a family member and the quality wasn't what I had expected. I didn't bother returning it since they still enjoyed it but I would rather have saved my money and bought them something else.
3,Beautiful photos.,"The photos are stunning but the chapters are predictable, like in Mrs. Childers' 3 previous books. Why not explain a bit more about the other Haute Joaillerie Houses like, Mellerio dits Meller, Buccellati, JAR and their distinctive and highly original styles. Maybe an idea for the next edition? The photos of European royalty and their US ""counterparts"" are very nice and one recognises certain highly publicised items like, for instance Jackie O's famous ""moon""-earrings and Princess Diana's tiara. All in all, a nice book for a nice price if it's merely (very) easy reading you want."
1,brake,the hoist came out of the box with an unsafe loose brake. i don't know how to adjust it. the 800# to olympia provided with the instructional information is wrong. there is no phone# in the yellowpages at the address provided.maxl willis
3,Good smell,"It had a nice smell that wasn't too strong. I used it only when I was hanging the clothes out to dry. It left the shirts soft after hanged out, it didn't do much for the jeans. The few time I did put it in the drier (rain storms) they were static free."
1,LCD Sucks,"I thought it was going to light up all kinds, but when i recieved the item and turned off all the lights to see how well the LCD was in fact i could hardly tell that it was even on. I could see any numbers on the screen which made it pointless to have it in the dark if the LCD doesn't even work properly. Also when using it in the light you have to face the screen flat in order to see the numbers at all, you are not able to look directly at the face. I think this is very upsetting and wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
5,EARLY RITA HAYWORTH,HIT THE SADDLE. A very early movie of Rita Hayworth having a significant part but under a different billing. If not for her I would not have wanted the movie as it is typical western fare for the period.
3,so-so,"Initially, this keyboard made me pretty happy. I was using a notebook computer and just didn't feel comfortable using it's embedded keyboard (cramped and gets hot when computer works hard). That's why this Logitech keyboard was purchased.Logitech's keyboard generally works nicely, but I since moved away from using it. Yes, I'm back to the notebook keyboard. Here's why: in my opinion (of course) the Navigator keyboard has two design flaws.Spongy keys. Well, I'm not sure exactly how to describe that, but the keys are either depressed with deep motions, or they just are too spongy. I type slower on this keeboard than ever before!?Function keys are disabled by default. The same buttons function as shortcuts to Windows programs first. You must switch on the keys with some other button after every boot. That is just not natural for me. If you don't use function keys - then this style may be right for you."
4,Extremely Satisfied,"For the price , the performance and the clearity you get is too good. Beats any other projector in the price range of $1000.00 to $1400.00 It works well with DVD Player, Laptop and TV. Macbook users will have to buy a $16.00 RCA connect cable for macbook to projector connection and you are all set."
4,Photo Club Review,"This is the best projector we've used, but it isn't perfect. Even with all of the color corrections possible using the menu system, photos don't come out exactly as seen on the monitor. Start up and shut down are easy. The menu works easily and well.For the price, it is very acceptable."
4,Good general projector for charts and graphs,"I bought this projector for a stock trading group, and it worked great for that purpose. It will connect easy to any laptop, large viewing area and clean image.The downside is when I use it for watching movies by projecting them on the wall at home. Color sometimes isn't as great as I would like, and although you can adjust that, it seems as it isn't true to the source image. The moving image seems to jerk sometimes. I am not positive if it is the source or the projector, but it is very noticeable to me with that large image.Yes, I could have spent more if I was doing more ""Big Wall Movie Nights"", but for the original intent, this projector does a great job. As the side use of movies, it is okay and for the cost, is good."
4,"Great colours, a little bit noisy",The colors and image quality are great on the VGA input from the computer. The fan is a bit noisy. The label says it supports component video input but you need an extra cable that is $100 more. Also the cable has a male input instead of female so it wont work right away with your ps3/xbox component cable.
3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"Waiting is hilarious! It took me a while to get this movie, because I thought it was just another overrated trendy comedy and because of Andy Milonakis, who is the single most disgusting creature God has ever put on this planet. The movie is truly hysterical, but it lacks any real storyline. It's just people working in a restaurant and what happens during a busy shift. While the lines, characters, and game they play are hilarious, that's all there is to this film. It has no real story, discernable plot, or substance to it. It's the perfect movie to watch if you just wanna sit down and watch something stupid that you don't really have to think about."
1,Rehash without notice = ripoff,"Can Mr. Luboff, Avalon Travel books, or Amazon spell E-T-H-I-C-S ?My wife and I are determined to move to Mexico. We have been reading several books about the process of making this transition and eagerly awaited Mr. Luboff's book. Having purchased (and enjoyed) his 1999 book, Live Well in Mexico, we figured, the 2002 Adapter Kit, would have more detail, and provide further assistance in our move. THE TWO BOOKS ARE ONE AND THE SAME!! Chapters were simply moved around, and 2 renamed.I don't have a problem with Mr. Luboff reworking his earlier book, but wouldn't it be ethical to state somewhere (on the cover, in the intro, OR in Amazon's write-up)that fact? I am disappointed. I have to assume Mr. Luboff has nothing further to say and forgot he had already published one book on the subject."
3,Comparing Books,"I also purchased Live Mexico and and Adapter Kit Mexico which I found to be an updated version of Live Well. More importantly, I used Adapter Kit Mexico as a resource for a potential purchase of a second home in Mexico. Life in Mexico is fluid not static and what I appreciated about this book is that it pointed me in the right direction and gave me a strategy for where to live and buy property."
3,Fatuous & pretentious (Hazard indeed),"I used this book for research on Yeats' Byzantium poems, & I must admit that Adams presents many wonderful ideas about WBY, but he does so in a way that is so difficult to decipher, it hardly seems worth the effort. I am by no means a literary mastermind, but neither am I a terribly ""slow"" individual, & I found this book to be fairly difficult reading. I had to read several passages over, & very slowly, to decipher Adams' ""academese."" He could very easily have expressed the same ideas without such pretentious jargon and structure. All in all-- it is filled good ideas which are rendered virtually incomprehensible by their presentation. I suspect that most people who make an attempt at it won't last very long (I dredged through it solely out of neccessity). What a waste :o("
2,Very Disappointing...,"I was very disappointed when I recieved this book. It is one of the few works on this subject but is very basic and does not cover the subject in depth. The book is aimed at a young audience, ie. elementary school age, and will be of minimal help or interest to a university student or any reader who desires more than just a superficial, general knowledge of the Khoikhoi people. The language is very simple and the book contains photographs on nearly every page."
2,Yuk! If you like less sweet you might like this,"I tried and liked the Almond Brownie flavor so I bought a box of Peanut Butter since I usually love that flavor, but these were very disappointing. I tend to like things on the sweet side so these were more like cardboard. I wish I had tried one bar before buying a whole box but they didn't have this flavor at my gym--now I know why."
2,Thanks for sending me stale bars.,"Don't buy from this supplier. The bars I got looked and tasted like they sat in the heat for ages until they were eventually sold. I love these bars and have eaten them elsewhere, so I was disappointed by the quality of the ones I bought."
4,The tastiest protein bar you're ever going to find!,"What a delicious treat! With only 19g of fat and 30g of carbohydrates, Oh Yeah bars provide a whopping 27g of protein. At 380 calories, it's a good meal replacement or a well-earned snack for those days on which you're particularly active or you've worked out extra hard at the gym. As one might expect from a high quality food product these days, there are no trans fats at all. With high quality healthy snacks like this available in the marketplace, it's tough to imagine why any thinking person would ever choose a regular candy bar!If I had my druthers, I'd like to see a little less sugar (there's 8g in this particular flavour) and a wee bit more protein but I expect the sugar is at least in part responsible for the fabulous taste. I suppose one can't have everything.The only problem I can see with this bar is it tastes so darn good that I have a tendency to snarf it down rather than chewing daintily and savouring it. Sigh!Paul Weiss"
4,Great Details,"This book is not for the weak of heart. The author puts his biases aside and just clearly explains what goes on in this part of the American criminal justice system. He takes you through the equipment used and the manufactures of the equipment. He looks over the legal framework for the convicted man / woman. The process of actually testing and performing the sentence. He also spends some time talking to people that are for and against the method of punishment. All in all this is a very interesting and well-done book that tells the reader everything they would want to know about this process. If you are interested in law enforcement, the BoP or criminal law then I would suggest finding a copy of this book."
4,Interesting and Informative,"An excellent look inside the death penalty system including the creator of the lethal injection machine and interviews with death row inmates. It's informative and tries to remain detached (tough in places), but is a very worthwile and honest look into the engine that drives the system."
4,a brief review,"Though the book is a bit dated (in years), it doesn't feel dated. The most interesting aspect of the book is that it explores capital punishment from three distinct perspectives: from the maker of lethal injection machine (as well as other execution equipment), prison administration, and inmates on death row. In my opinion, the author doesn't present the topic in a particularly slanted or gruesome manner. Surely worth reading...enjoy."
3,Poorly written but still important.,"This book is poorly written, from the title to the last chapter, almost to the point of distracting the reader from the topic of the book: the process of executing murderers. Despite these pervasive flaws, the book is an interesting and important read even though the material is somewhat dated."
1,Poorly designed and even more poorly made,"A very crude and inefficient stuffer. It's cast iron (very rough sand casting) so its extremely heavy and, unless attached to a counter (unlikely for most users,) very unstable and hard to get much leverage.The above could be forgiven if the performance wasn't so poor. Vey shoddy fit between the horn and ram means that about 1/3 of the capacity bypasses the ram and must be re-stuffed.Mine will become a boat anchor this summer"
1,don't waste your money,Ditto to the other negative reviews. This thing will stuff 5 lb sausage in about 2 hours. Why? The sausage squeezes out around the flange and you actually stuff about 3 inches with each plunge. Mine went to the Goodwill store.
5,Best Webcam I have ever used.,"This is a great webcam, very handy , easy to use. We have recorded lots of small video clips and send it to our friend and relatives. They all like it and few of them have purchased this webcam just after seeing those videos. So easy to use that even my 16 month daughter enjoys working with it and loves to watch herself getting recorded !!!"
4,My experience with the Pro 4000,This was my first Web Cam. It's performance far exceeded my expectations. I use the internal Mike when ON Echolink - This Link is for Licensed Amatuer Radio Operators - I have had many complimentary reports on the excellent Audio response.I am purchasing a second Pro 4000 for a family Member. I have chosen this Model because I personally know that the Performanceis excellent.
5,Wow Great,"This product is great for many reasons. You can use AIM on it, pictures, my favorite clay animation, stop animtion, and it can be used as a regular camera. If anyone wants to do a school project, which involves a video camera or stop animation, this is perfect. You can make funny movies, sad movies, realistic movies, movies of all kind."
1,NOT FOR MACS AS ADVERTISED!,"I just got the camera today and was very excited to try it out--and THERE'S NO SOFTWARE TO INSTALL THE CAMERA FOR MAC! So, I have another useless webcam sitting around my apartment, which I DO NOT need!"
4,QuickCam Pro Review,Great web cam and reasonably priced. Still working on getting the audio to work as there seems to be a firewall issue.
4,Good buy,My sister and I both got this product so we could talk long distance. Good picture but we're still working on the sound. If our speakers are up too high there's feed back. It's probably just that we need to do some tweeking on our part. Overall we're very happy with the camera's. It's a great way to keep in touch!
2,Not comfortable with it,"I have been used this product before, the quality is okay, not very impressive though.Now i am using other cameras like IP Camera. I am lucy to find out that some of the IP Camera like IP Camera 8000 can act as webcam, and can be placed anywhere in my house and be viewed anywhere in the world. That's too convenience for me because i did not have to hook camera to my computer anymore.Also imagine you can watch your babies in their bedroom or the dinning room from outside like your office. That's too cool. Forget the webcam..."
4,Excellent video but lots of echo from audio,"The camera installs very easily on XP with SP2 and latest patches -- very straight forward. Video is excellent and automatically adjusts well to lighting conditions. However, the mic is so sensitive that it picks up alot of echo if you are not using a headset. The sound from the person you are video conferencing with comes out your speakers gets fed back into mic causing an echo). If they could provide audio echo cancellation in the QuickCam, I'd give it 5 stars and use MSN video conferencing much more. For those having trouble installing this camera, the problem is on your end. Update your software!!"
5,The clearest and fastest cam i have found yet!!,"I use my logitech webcam every single day in the line of work that i do. It is by far the best webcam on the market for the price. It is super clear...has zoom ...and has a great built-in microphone. I wouldn't buy any other webcam to replace this one ever. This cam will be with me for a very, very long time.Honestly, the only downfall of the cam which really isn't a downfall at all..is the face tracking. I don't like it...but i'm sure other people do. It just moves too much for me. Other than that...this webcam is top of the line...THE BEST!!"
1,A sorry design of a product!,The reviews that you see about the poor mechanical design of this webcam is really true. Don't get carried away and buy it like I did. It is just not worth the money.There are tonnes of better products at much better prices.I wish I could return mine though!...It is too late now!
1,"Good image quality, very poor service","I gave 1 star for good image, sound quality. Stand is also good looks and feels good. SO why only 1 star? Because don't know whether Logitech will provide driver support for next release of Mac OS X.I bought a QuickCam Pro 3000 and it supports only Mac os 9, but not 10!:( When I contacted Logitech support they said me to buy a QuickCam Pro 4000. I borrowed one from a friend and tested. It worked well. But I couldn't make my mind to buy this poorly supported product. I thought when Apple releases its next version of OS, Logitech will not support for that and will say to buy a new camera. I can't trust logitech. I would buy an iSight, which works well with both Windows and Macintosh."
1,Worst webcam ever,The webcam shows pictures only intermittently. The short waranty period and no 1800 tech support number have made installing and getting this camera to work the single most frustrating experience in past 6 months. The tech support in addition has been distinctly unhelpful. The camera built is also flimsy with the round portion popping out of the stand every now and then.I have been using computers for past 10 years (programming) and have not experienced any problems with hardware till date.It is the first time I have written a review for any product and the only reason is that I have felt compelled by the poor standard of the equipment.
1,do not buy,"They advertise as easy to use. Yet I could not get the audio to work. In going to the logitech site this was clearly a known issues with no help given. When asked what to do they gave a third party option and then disavowed it, since it was third party. DO NOT BUY!!"
1,Logitech Manufacturers rebate,"Logitech Manufacturers rebate is a farce, you will not get the rebate in most probablity. In spite of sending all the required forms etc for an earlier Logitech product, they say I have not sent the ""Original UPC"" code. Ha !"
2,QuickCam not compatible Window Media Center Edition 2005 OS,"Warning to anyone running the Window Media Center Edition 2005 (MCE) operating system - This webcam will not work with any messenger program (Yahoo, MSN, AIM)!From Logitech Tech Support:Thank you for your recent inquiry about your QuickCam Pro 4000.I understand that you would like to know if QuickCam is supported on the Window Media Center Edition 2005 OS.Unfortunately, I regret to inform you that QuickCam is not supported on the Window Media Center Edition 2005 OS currently. We are not sure when and if this OS will be supported.I request you to check back at the Logitech website in future for updates that may contain support for the Window Media Center Edition 2005 OS.I apologize for the inconvenience caused."
3,"Love the camera, hate the software","I bought this on Amazon.com for $79.98. The CD installed software worked only briefly before it failed to capture video. I got an error message that said, ""Unable to save video to ""c:\windows\temp\log16.avi"". I uninstalled and reinstalled a few times, and gave up. So I emailed Logitech's support. They responded the next day and asked me to do a clean uninstall and to reinstall the latest software. I did that but improvised here and there. That did the trick, but oh boy it took more than 5-6 hours to get this webcam working at last. Such a pain. The picture and audio (built-in camera) was pretty good, and I think I will keep this camera after all. My last purchase, which I returned, was the Logitech QuickCam Messenger. The picture quality was really awful, and you can see the really grainy picture. If you are into better picture quality, go for the Quickcam Pro 4000 but beware of the software installation. It's a real hassle."
2,Flimsy rotating support - poor design,What a monster to use ..the eye ball keeps falling off because the rotating support is so week. The power cable is so heavy that the eyeball keeps dropping when you move the eyeball.Quality is reasonable but such poor design.
4,A good device,I bought this web cam for my son and daughter-in-law who live hours from us. We have used the QuickCam and generally it does a good job. With a lot of motion the picture is a little fussy but not problems otherwise. Setup was easy. Emailing videos is easy. and live video setup was easy.
4,not bad but...,"i own it for several weeks , its camera is good and can give u a clear sight of this , but its addtional microphone is a little bit xxxx ..."
2,Could NOT get it to work with Windows XP & Yahoo Messenger,"I have to give this thing a somewhat poor rating because the documentation and web support are weak. I could not get this device to work with my Windows XP Pro system (I am very computer literate) and Yahoo Messenger 5.5. I'm not sure if it's a Windows/Yahoo/Logitech problem, but after cleaning my computer's registry, searching for tech notes, installing/reinstalling/uninstalling, I could not get this thing to work (I threw away many hours of my life trying)! I gave up on my desktop computer (Win XP machine) and installed on my Windows 2000 Pro laptop...bingo! It worked. For the price, it's not horrible, but I don't love it. The software bundle is a bit cheesy. As far as being ""flimsy"" as others have written...I'm not sure how rugged it needs to be sitting on your monitor?! I have enjoyed making stupid faces at my brother in-law who lives in San Diego...our kids love it too."
1,I cannot believe the reviews this camera got,I cannot believe the reviews this camera got !So far my experience with it has been sub-optimal.Setup was very simple.I dont see what is so great about it. It performs about the same as my connectix/logitech quickcam vc-which was poor.The pic is fuzzy and no amout of fooling around with the focus ring gets it sharp.The camera stand is flimsy-a piece of junk.The visor falls off.The camera is too light for the usb cable and you really can't get it to stand up straight-not to mention aiming it.The cam moves rolls around in the ball socket thing.PIECE of CRAP
2,Doesn't work with current Mac software,"It does mention in the specs that it only works with Mac OS X 10.2.6 and below, so I should have known better, but with the glowing reviews and lack of much else that works on a Mac, I figured I'd give it a try. They're right; it doesn't work. It did actually work for about five minutes, and then started giving me error messages. It does however work with Maccam software, which is a free download at http://webcam-osx.sourceforge.net/. Hurray for those guys!"
3,Logitech Rebates are deceptive,"I purchased this product and so far am happy with it. I do, however, believe that Logitech as a company is deceptive in it's rebate allowance. I typically review rebate information very closely, as I know that rebates include as many restrictions as possible to avoid to company paying them out. I read the Amazon rebate description carefully a couple of times, and felt I could get the rebate upon purchase. When I went to Logitech to fill out the rebate, there was additional information restrictions that said you had to purchase BOTH a desktop AND a notebook webcam, and that both had to be on the same receipt. I found this to be not only deceptive, but also a little ridiculous, as I wonder how many people would actually buy BOTH a desktop and a notebook webcam.The best advice I can give you is assume that you will pay the price without the rebate, and count yourself lucky if a rebate is ever provided."
4,Supported under Linux,"A couple of the other reviewers mentioned that the Windows software shipped with the camera was quite poor. I haven't noticed, as I've been using camera with Linux. The camera works fine with the Philips USB Camera Driver.Amazon rules don't let me include a URL, but a quick Google search should bag you the driver site for the (binary only) PWCX driver needed by the open source PWC driver, that ships with the kernel, to get the best out of the camera hardware."
4,Great Webcam,"This is a great webcam. The only reason i gave it 4 stars was because the pin that connects it to the base keeps loosening. So you have to tighten it often. As for the cam, its great. It has a face tracking feature and a night light feature for dark rooms. Its a very good buy."
3,Logitech Quickcam Pro 4000,"Overall, the Quickcam is okay. It doesn't have great resolution. (It's not my computer... Dell 2.8ghz, 512mb memory, 40 and 120 gig HD and upgraded video card) It isn't able to put the video to fit the size of the screen. Also, the software is very intrusive. It tries to set the quickcam as the default for everything!!! Would I buy again? Not for the $60 er so dollars I paid. I thought it would come with some cool software like my other ligitch cam came with... like the ability to do stopmotion productions and the ability to have it monitor a room with motion activation. Feel free to e-mail me with any specific questions."
2,Built-in microphone is horrible!,"The logitech advertises the built-in microphone as one of the major functions of this webcam. However, it does not work at all because it catches too much background noise. I ended up buying a new microphone to work with this webcam. Consider this drawback before you purchase this item. You may consider another cheaper product without built-in microphone because you still need to pay for it."
4,"Very good camera, but not for low light","I bought this camera with the intention of using it as a motion detector security camera. The auto-white balance and auto-exposure works very well, except that at very low light (night with no lights) the camera tries too hard and bumps up the exposure gain beyond its capabilities. The result is a snowy picture, which my motion detection software struggles with.That said, the camera will be very good for almost everything else. The camera adjust very well to the ambient light conditions, and gives you a clear, sharp picture."
1,Logiech Pro 4000,This webcam is a piece of JUNK. Don't waste your time or money. Buy a webcam from another company but not Logitech. They are totally overrated. This webcam lasted one month and died. The Tech Support is horrible. You know more than they do. The definition for Tech Support at Logitech is No Support.
1,Logitech revue,"Product ,Logitech pro 4000 : Microphone does not work when used in voice and video conversation using windows messenger , had to buy supplimental microphone. Logitech technical support totally useless. LOGITECH REFUSED TO HONOR THERE ADVERTISED ...REBATE. I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND BUYING ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY , YOU WILL PROBABLY BE SORRY YOU DID."
4,Good,Great image quality over other webcams i tried. However software didnt work well with my XP and I tried to uninstall and install over adozen times with tech help from the company. I cant take stills or videos with it from its own software. SO instead I opted to keep the cam for its image quality and use the xp digital video software to make up for what this cam/s software did not allow me to do.
1,Not Compatible with Windows 7!,"Yes, this is an older model from Logitech that's about 6 years old. But I was disappointed to find that they aren't going to produce a driver for this webcam for Windows 7. Where this camera would have a great rating from me, that's no longer the case. Don't buy it unless you want to use it on older operating systems."
4,Good Buy!,"This is for sure one of the best buys I'v got involved in. Very good web camera, not too good for the still picture feature, but excellent for online chat programs such as 'SKYPE' & 'MSN'. Good Buy. A++++"
1,Does not work with messenger services,"In case you're buying the 4000 to send video when using messenger programs, I'll try to save you some of the time I've spent searching for help and money calling the long distance customer support line.Logitech advertises the 4000 for use specifically with AOL IM or MSN Messenger, however, it doens't work with recent versions of either. Logitech customer support is aware of the problem, but is not changing their advertising, or posting any info about the problem on their website or help files. Logitech also doesn't know when they'll have a software upgrade that fixes this problem - one customer service rep estimated it would be a couple of months."
2,BE aware!,Hi !I want to say something about this camera!Be aware that amazon sells a version of this camera without the flat panel clip!!!!Some other stores have the flat panel clip with it where you can attach the camera to a flat panel screen.I bought the camera this week and the clip was not included. that is probably why they sell the camera so cheap.despite that i recommend the camera.
4,"Great Camera, ...","I looked at this camera mainly for long-distance calling over the internet. I find that although the image is smaller than I expected over AIM (and there is no sound), you can use MSN Messenger to get both a bigger image and sound. Be careful--if you're using AOL to get online, it may restrict your ability to send/recieve video and audio. My boyfriend could not send sound over the internet because AOL blocked that aspect. But overall it's a good little camera that serves its purpose well."
5,The info that it's out of print is incorrect ('99 edition),Immigration Practice by Robert Divine 1999 Edition is not out of print
2,"blurry, mediocre quality","This looks like a great painting, or so I'm sure the orginal was....Don't know exactly what they did, but it looks like they took a picture of the painting, then printed the thing on glossy paper on their home printer. The ""poster"" is blurry, and as stated, looks like it came from a crummy ink-jet.I gave it 2 stars because it really is a nice picture (but the quality sucks)."
3,Adequate but could be better,"I'll start with the good points. This product is very easy to use. The magnet is just right, meaning that it easily sticks to the top of my truck but is not difficult to remove. The light works well, and it's simple to change the light pattern.However, the light is not very bright. It is not very visible in the sunlight. Also, the cord is a little too short to get from the cigarette lighter to the top of the truck and sometimes gets in the way."
5,rec'd on time and packaged well,"bought two for my tractor trailers, front and rear when we haul heavy equipment. the product is very good and very visable for the DOT"
5,refreshing reflection on the needs Of Blacks in America,Professor Ashby has captured the essence of the status of blacks in america today. he has successfully placed black Americans at the bank of the jordan and has given a refreshing and possiable solution to crossing over. I found the reading to be easy and understandable. This view can change the current state of affairs for Blacks in america if read and applied.
5,A fantastic follow-up,"Humor illustrates tough truths in this new book of propaganda posters from Micah Wright. This time he writes his own accompanying political text instead of relying the Center for Constitutional Research, and the book does not suffer for it... in fact, the text is both informative AND funny. A great book."
2,Really tepid mystery...,"""Killing Thyme"" by Peter Abresch is the second of the Dandy series. Basically, Doddie and Jim are reunited and have to solve another mystery. They do get to the bottom of why all these chefs are dying, but it is uninteresting, save a plot device involving lesser known uses of olive oil. Jim also says ""yeah, buddy"" to a gratitious level, and I was not amused. That, and ""damnit to hell"" were overused, and it shows that Abresch's writing is thin."
3,neat but doesn't work on all nuts,"Pro:The chamber keeps shell fragments from shooting about and making a mess.Cons:It doesn't work if the nut is too small or the wrong shape.There's not enough leverage for really hard or big nuts. Those nuts are easier to crack with hinged nut crackers, but then you have a mess of shell fragments."
3,OK for the price.,"I got this holster as an alternative to my Galco holster. It fits my S&W ""N"" frame revolver just fine and the adjustable strap is a good idea. I am less impressed with the leather it is made of. The material has a thin almost papery feel. I don't think it is going to be as durable as I would like. Still for $30 dollars it not a bad buy."
5,Well-Made Flat Plug,"We used this right-angle plug to run a short, unobtrusive extension from the socket above our kitchen counter to our toaster and it works perfectly."
5,Nice small cord,Bought this to hide an extension cord for the power conditioner for the stereo. Nice heavy duty plug for the money.
5,Nice for TV mounts that keep TVs close to the wall,My TV in the house is mounted on the wall. It is an older TV and the wall mount was a flush wall mount. It was an older TV is it was a lot thicker then the TVs that they sell now. It did not leave much room for where the electrical cord plugged into the wall but this fixed the issue. Plus it was short enough so I did not have to coil up the extra cord.
5,Nice for a tight space,"I bought this to use with a wall-mounted LCD. The LCD has a bulk bottom, which is where the power outlet behind the tv is located so there the tilting ability of the mount was limited because of a standard power cord. I bought this, plugged it in and now the tv can tilt as designed. Works perfect and hugs the wall nicely!"
4,"Good, but not great","The reason I purchased this cord was for my LCD TV to hang on the wall. The cord that came with the unit stuck too far out and rather than getting a recessed outlet and having it installed, I figured a 90 degree plug would be a good cheap solution... and it was. Sort of. The cable is good quality, and the male end of the plug is pretty compact. However, the female end is quite bulky, so bulky that unless tucked on top of the end of the tv, it would push the tv out and away from the wall... that wouldn't work.So if you're looking for a cable for a mounted Flat Screen TV... you might want to try a different one that's slimmer all around."
4,One of Craven's earlier chillers,"ONE of Craven's earlier chillers which I thought was pretty good. Mara Jensen and her husband live on a farm and her husband is accidentally killed. (not a spoiler it happens in the first ten minutes!) Her friends Sharon Stone and Susan Buckley(patty from grease) come to stay with her. Besides them, Mara's only other friends are Lois Nettleton and her shy daughter who live nearby. Soon more accidents are happening ,obviously a killer is on the loose! You get a snake in the tub(just try to watch!), Mara Jensen in two catfights, and sharon stone freaking out in a barn and falling down stairs. i don't know why this is so hard to find. they should re-release it. luckily i have a copy i bought used a few years back. if you can find it get it."
3,DVD Please,"Please release the ""Deadly Blessing"" on dvd. I think it is fun to see Sharon Stone as she was 26 years ago."
1,This is A region 2 DVD.,"This add says this is an all region DVD. That is not true. This is A region 2 DVD. Needs to be a true all region or a region 1 DVD. That said, it is too bad for this is a Good 3 star film. Received A copy sent it back & received the same thing again. Getting a refund this time. Amazon should put region 2 on their add."
3,Saw this as a teen had a lasting affect,There is a voyeur scene in this movie that well. I remember vividly. The movie is somewhat scary. I am glad they put it out again.
2,Deadly Blessing,"Deadly Blessing is one of Wes Craven's pre ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" films. Deadly Blessing is about a Hiteit community, where a mysterious killer is killing off people of the community. The locals blame it on a woman they call the incubus. Deadly blessing is nothing more than a dull movie. Really only notable for an early appearance of Sharon Stone."
3,Deadley Blessing,Another one of the stories that I did not relate too (for some reason) but I am sure others will rate it much higher.
1,"Buyer Beware - ""Disc Error""","Too bad. This, as I remember, was an excellent movie, genuinely creepy. But, this disc only works in certain disc players. Of the three in the house where I live, it won't play on mine, or the one in the living room. I rent part of a house from family members, and the systems I have access to, will NOT play the movie. It won't read the disc.BUYER BEWARE.P.S. In hindsight, the one star rating might be wrong, but I am leaving it intact, because I mistakenly bought a disc which wasn't formatted to play in American-made equipment. And others could make the same mistake."
1,Buy at your own risk,I have never understood these chocolates. NO ONE in my family likes them. We can't give 'em away!
3,Love that chocolate...not the delivery time!,"Delivery of this item (4) of them was not as timely as Amazon usually delivers.I have ordered Baci chocolates for the last 5 years from NY, and I was hoping Amazon would be more dependable. The chocolates are wonderful, and those who receive them from me are always thrilled!"
2,Stale,I've ordered these elsewhere before and they were wonderful. These however were stale to the point the chocolate had a white haze.
1,this contradicts upanishads,This commentary on Bhagavad Gita contradicts various upanishads. Aritificial 4 rules are being asked to follow in this edition to make it a cult status. Lord Krishna does not ask to follow any specific regulative principles in the original Bhagavad Gita.
3,its ok,"condition of my copy was poor, but the book itself is good enough for a good introduction about vampires. you need more books to deeply learn about them in greater details."
3,Entertaining But Misleading,"I enjoy reading the ""idiot's guides"" series, and this one was no exception. it was a pleasant read, but i did have some issues with it.Your personal beliefs will influence how seriously you take this book. quite a few parts were quite amusing, and hard to take seriously.Also, quite often it groups ""witches"" into the ""mythical"" or ""dark"" types of creatures. I did NOT find this amusing. i am a pagan witch, and don't appreciate being referred to as practically subhuman. The author makes one tiny reference to wiccan witches, but this does not excuse the flagrant story spinning throughout the rest of the book.Aside from that, i did enjoy the book. i learned some things that i didnt know, and i enjoyed my reading experience. i dont regret buying it."
5,Did you hear the one about the vampire who lost his false teeth?,"my favorite movie covered is DEAFULA .... a hearing impaired vampire. ho ho ho. this is a fun book. too short to be tell all, but good enough for VAMPIRE LORE 101."
1,This book is grossly overrated,"The book provides a detailed description of the lives of eight Chinese-American women and the issues they have to face. However, by the end of first few sections the book becomes redundant with very predictable outcomes. Certain details, such as jobs at fortune cookie factories, lead to a general impression of primitivity and lack of imagination. The story itself tries to imitate conflicts and plots of a mature tragedy, but does so rather poorly. The book may have been slightly more acceptable if its profusion of characters had been cut down to two. Other than for a required assignment this book does not add much to one's reading experience."
2,i was forced to read this for my english class.,There are too many characters with similiar-sounding names...it is confusing.
3,Science made simple...,A wonderful book for young science enthusiasts. Includes simple science experiments that can be performed with ordinary household items. Some experiments require adult supervision.
2,Made in Germany?,"I have 4 Stabila levels and they are all superior products. I recently purchased the 72"" Type 80A-2 3-Vial Contactor's level and was shocked by what came. Instead of having machined alluminum faces (like my other Stabila levels), this level is just stamped from sheet metal. How long can you expect this edge to be accurate? One bump with a hammer and your straight edge is gone. It is 1/4 inch thinner and 1/4 inch more narrow than my other Stabila levels. It says ""Germany"" on the side but no where does it say ""Made in Germany"" like my other Stabila levels. This level looks to me like it came right out of China marketed on a good German name. Don't waste your money on it."
5,Informative & Enjoyable,"For those who endeavor to perfect fine art digital printmaking, this is the book to read. It is a ""how to"" and so much more. The book covers paper, ink, techniques, hand coloring and the practical application and intereaction of all of these variables. The book is cogently written and elegantly displayed. It is a must for anyone's library who wishes to expand their horizons in the digital printing arena. Ms. Airey is a master of her craft and it shows."
4,Acid Jazz at its finest!,"This is the perfect cd to play when you've got a frew friends coming over for drink -- hip and urban. It's the kind of music people will have not heard of, but will want to get after listening to for only a little while.Their version of Whole Lotta Love alone is worth getting."
3,Cheap lights for your truck,"These are easy to install and work great. Not the brightest with the 55W H3 bulb, but can be upgraded to 100W - all you have to do is drop in the brighter bulb!"
4,"a bit arduous, but definitely worth looking into","We bought this book for my 79-year-old mother, who's in good health, very active, has no particular health concerns - but who occasionally talks about having ""senior moments"". I skimmed through most of it (and did some of the exercises), and she's taking it very seriously. We both find the book a bit boring, actually, but are keen to assimilate the principles involved. The first goals she set were to memorize things like her social security and license plate numbers (which, of course, all the rest of us already know by heart, no?). I find the strategy the author suggests for remembering numbers perfectly idiotic because it's much too complicated, but my mother thinks the word:number correspondence idea quite appealing. Maybe because she only has 7 digits to memorize, whereas all my phone numbers have at least 10 digits, not including the country code..."
5,Memory Bible,Sorry I forgot what the book said. But I think it was really good. But I do not recall exactly why. Buy this book because my memory is perfect now and yours can be too :-)
2,"Not nearly as effective as ""The Memory Book""","This book takes a very clinical approach to memory improvement, obviously because it was written by a doctor. I found this approach to be of little use to me. I feel that my memory is not very good because I simply do not know how to use it very well, not because I am suffering from any physiological problems like Alzheimer's. I found much more useful information from ""The Memory Book"" because it focused on memory excercises and tricks to improve a person's memory. I am currently reading ""Learn to Remember"" and I will report back on that when I am done."
2,One out of five cats...,"I bought these treats in the hope of putting a little weight onto our eldest cat. She can't have grain, so I thought this would be a good purchase. Unfortunately she turned her nose up at it. Three others did the same as well. They would rather bat it around than eat it. The one cat that does eat the treats doesn't need to. It's possible that I just bought the wrong flavor, but I am hesitant to purchase more."
5,¡LA MAGIA SI EXISTE!,"...Todos caminamos ciegos a LA MAGIA QUE NOS RODEA ! Y pensar que podemos aprovecharla cada día?Este libro es como un puñado de flechas rojas que nos señala qué timbre oprimir o que puerta tocar PARA DESPERTAR ANTE LA MAGIA DE NUESTRO ALREDEDOR...A mi me sirvió MUCHÍSIMO..Por eso, SE LOS RECOMIENDO! ¡USTEDES MISMOS VERÁN COMO CAMBIA SU VIDA !!"
5,Remo Drum Rocks!!,"Length:: 1:29 MinsBest thing I ever purchased for my son. He's been playing since age 6 months. Worth 10X what we paid for it. Its made to last. Occasionally after a set he will stand on it and announce something in baby gibberish which I take to mean ""thanks to Remo for making me so happy""."
3,low-fidelity,"sound mars an otherwise excellent Kirk performance. that said, this title, while certainly featuring some truly-inspired playing by Rahsaan, especially on the Coltrane medley closing the set, is none-the-less one that should not be at the top of your list when acquiring live albums by the man. for live Rahsaan from the 1970s, start with Bright Moments. if you can acquire it at a reasonable price, get the out-of print I, Eye, Aye next. the performances contained therein are just as assured and kaleiodoscopic as they are here and the sound on both, to be sure, is far superior to Brotherman. as the owner of nearly his entire discography, I feel quite confident in making these statements. thanks for reading and have a great day!"

1,Disappointment,I'm not sure why this product received 17 positive reviews. Maybe they are all from resellers or have some other vested interest. It does not polish and protect as described. There are other products on the market which function significantly better and cost much less. Be forewarned.
5,Not without surprises!,"From Whence They Came by Arlene ColverA must-read for those who have already savored Magdalene's Way, this prequel reveals the early life of Magdalene as a temple virgin, High Priestess, wife, daughter-in-law and apostle of Jesus. The parallels with Mother Mary hint at the karmic links between these two historical women. In this simple human tale told with reverence and clarity, Arlene Colver shines a warm new light on some of the hidden possibilities of early Christianity...not without its surprises!.Sept 12, 2004Cynthia LombardoNewburyport ,MassEnglish Teacher, Astrologer"
3,Stolen from the library?,"The item is generally OK, but:1. It evidently was a library book;2. Its condition is satisfactory rather than very good (as it was specified by vendor), even we keep in mind that the book has been published in 1963."
2,3rd drive in 9 months,"Let me start by saying I've been a WD fan for several years, and have had excellent luck with their internal drives. I suspect that the disk drives in My Books are fine also.My first My Book wouldn't even power on no matter what I did. This occurred after about 2 months. Today the Fire Wire interface on my second My Book quit working. Luckily the USB interface still works.45 minutes with support trying to get my warranty straightened our didn't help my confidence level with this company. I agree that having a $320.00 hold put on a credit card for a $150 device is ridiculous.I bought this device to back up my data, but I no longer have faith that if I need them my files will be there."
3,Tener bien claro en que se utilizará...,"Rápido para lectura, lento para escritura. Es tolerante a fallos y no pierde la información. Pero presenta problemas muy frecuentemente, para resolver estos problemas es necesario realizar chequeos de disco ( con chkdisk, por ejemplo).NO lo recomiendo si se pretente utilizar intensivamente en entradas y salidas, mas si lo recomiendo para utilizarse como dispositivo de respaldo."
1,DO NOT BUY Western Digital Products - YOU ARE WAISTING YOUR MONEY AND YOUR TIME,"I bought a WD My Book 500Gb and several months later it died. I created an RMA via WD website and started the process. Not only they took the whole month to send me a replacement, they also sent me a defective drive with many bad clusters. Also the drive's power button was locked in place and wasn't usable. WD customer support told me that they've started to disable this button since it was causing problems to the drive and refused to do anything about correcting this situation. I was buying WD before any other drive. Now I feel that I need to look elsewhere. WD customer service no longer exists. DO NOT BUY Western Digital Products - YOU ARE WAISTING YOUR MONEY AND YOUR TIME!"
1,BEWARE - DO NOT BUY,"I bought this exact drive and in less than 2 years it has completely failed. Dead as a doorknob. All data lost. Twice beforehand I had to wipe the drive and reformat it due to disk errors. Western Digital's response? Sorry, only a one year warranty on this model. DO NOT buy a Western Digital drive, they are unreliable. Yes every hard drive will die someday, but in less than 2 years? Do yourself a favor and shop other brands."
1,Bad,"One died at month 13, so I missed the 1 year warranty. Bought another and it died after 6 weeks. Not sure this one died, but my computer no longer recognizes it. Whatever. Customer Service was mediocre at best. Probably going with a Lacie Rugged. Those things work!"
1,"Bought two, both died and lost my data -- no help from WD","I bought two of these thinking WD was quality. I should have read some reviews, everyone's seems to be failing. When I contacted WD the five year warranty was suddenly a one year *limited* warranty and I was out-of-luck, plus my data was all lost."
1,Piece(s) of junk,"Sleek design but horribly unstable, loud, and unreliable after a few months. I've had 2 of these die on me after 5-6 months and I lost all my files both times. Luckily I learned the first time one of them died to BACK UP FILES all the time. This drive was a very disappointing and frustrating waste of money and time."
1,"Fails to mount, like others","Drive worked ok for about a year, then right outside of the warranty period it began failing to mount and is now unusable... buy another brand with all the bad reviews for this one."
1,A Nightmare!,"I have had two of these crash in one week, losing all my data. The drive seems to freeze when it warms up. While Western Digital's support quickly replaces the drives (with remanufactured drives) they are not helpful at all with fixing your existing drive. It's very disconcerting to hear them say ""Yep, it's no good. Go ahead and reformat."" I have had a Maxon external for two years without any problems. I will not be buying another Western Digital."
1,**** DO NOT Waste your money on this GARBAGE !!,"I purchased this unit 2 or 3 years ago, and it worked fine for the first year. Then it started whining off and on. At this point I should have started transferring my data to another source, but I didn't because it was still working fine. Recently it stopped being recognized by windows. I tried it on 4 different computers running XP and Windows 7. None of the computers recognized this drive. Sometimes it would show in ""My Computer"", but I couldn't get access to my files. Anyway, now I have over 100gb of data, on this useless drive, that I cannot retrieve. Their customer service is useless. My advice, spend more money and get a better brand if your data is at all important to you. Don't let what happened to me, happen to you."
5,A great and simple to use external,"I had this 500GB MyBook up and running about 60 seconds out of the box. Took me longer to push the plug into my UPS than the computer took to mount it as a drive!For compatibility reasons the drives all come formatted in FAT32. To use for video editing, which is why I bought it, I had to re-format it to NTSF. the reformat that took only a minute or two and I was off and running.Great drive, brainlessly simple to install and use.Sorry I can't comment on the backup software but I only use this for Video and photo and I have an NAS for all backup."
4,"Great Hard Drive, Childishly Crude Software","I did a good amount of research before I bought the Western Digital drive. I was attracted by its large capacity and positive review that I saw on Amazon and other sites.The reviews were correct as far as my experince--the drive has massive capacity, works well and was simple to install. It's USB plug-and-play, so I should say that I plugged it in and it installed itself.I gave it 4 stars because I was disappointed with the software. The interface is frustrating. It does full and differential back-ups of my user files just fine when I tell it to do so manually. But, as far as I can tell, the scheduling feature simply doesn't work. I've printed the scanty four-page manual and followed the trivial steps closely several times and even tried a few of my own. Nothing. The scheduled times show up just as the manual says. However, it has never run yet at a scheduled time."
1,Failure,"I was initially drawn to the My Book from Western Digital because of the size, price, and footprint. Unfortunately, I hadn't researched enough reviews from previous owners.After bringing the drive home, I plugged it into the computer and it loaded right up. I downloaded 6 or 7 gigs of important documents onto it, and went to bed. The next day it turned on once more, and then never again. After numerous e-mails to their tech department, I have yet to get a response.If the previous reviewer is right, (and I'm afraid he is), I'll be lucky to get a replacement, and have no chance of getting my data back. With what I've lost, it is the most expensive piece of computer equipment I've ever bought."
2,"Reliable, but takes forever..",I have a Seagate and a WD next to eachother and all file transfers take double the time in the WD. Transfer of 22 Gigs (txt files) took almost 4 hours with the WD 350 G.
1,Broke immediately.,"Pluuged it in, working nice, transferred a couple gigs of video, unmounted, unplugged.It wouldn't turn on again.The moral of this story is to stick to known brands. Ugh."
1,"Works good, But feel NOT good.","Purchased from AMAZON.When I opened a box, It packed up very well as new.But when I checked MY BOOK, I can tell it is used item.It has little scratches next to the button.It looks like returned item and I got that.It is working good. But I hope it is okay."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,"I have had this drive for two days and after copying files over and setting it up, I found I could not network the drive! An error occurs referring to not enough server space. I did my research and found that for most people who encounter this problem the solution is quick and easy, but for Western Digital, they do not support sharing over a network! Strange, but I tried everything to get it to work. This is my most disappointing purchase in some time, I am returning it and will never by Western Digital again."
2,Western Digital My Book Premium 500 GB External Hard Drive with Dual Interface,"Now what, .... I have saved all my data in some unknown scrambled format and can't do anything about it.I was hoping for a storage device that would give me the option of recognizing what I saved and being able to change what needs to be changed at a time when I feel it's necessary.Now I have to wait till doomsday arrives when I have to reinstall all my unidentifiable scrambled files?Way to much money for nothing!"
1,"Failed during initial format, I don't trust this product line :-(","I was really enthused about this drive. However, the lack of a physical on/off power switch seemed a little bizarre when I took it out of the packaging. It came up FAT32 and I wanted compressed NTFS so I fired up disk management under Windows and started up the format. At about 5% the format ""finished"", it said the drive was RAW but there really wasn't a drive there. The blue lights were on. I went to re-format it and it wouldn't format. I tried to activate the partition and Windows said ""unexpected error"", please restart. I plugged it into another computer and it wouldn't recognize it as a hard drive. I power cycled the first machine, plugged it in, no blue light, doesn't recognize it as a hard drive. I am returning this and will not trust my data to any Western Digital ""My Book"" product. Good concept, very flawed execution. Don't trust your data to this product line."
1,"Supports Macintosh, NOT",I purchased Mybook external drive primarily because its' advertised support of the macintosh. I use an external firewire drive as a startup disk to startup (boot) MacOS 10.4 while maintaining MacOS 10.5 on my internal drive. Well it turns out that You can't boot from Mybook unless the mac is an intel-based mac and Mybook drive has been setup with a GUID partition scheme. What ever that means. Of course I didn't find this out until I purchased this brick and Western Digital was of no help in my research! Also it has vibration that I can feel in my desk. I solved this problem by placing Mybook on a pad. How long the Mybook will hold up with this vibration is the question!
1,Not worth the price you pay for it,"The drive quit functioning properly after a couple of days. My computer wouldn't recognize the drive half the time, and the other half it wanted me to format the drive. I attempted to format, but windows was incapable of completing the format of the drive so I went in search to find out why. Apparently to format the drive you have to connect it to your desk top computer which was not in the instructions anywhere, and I wouldn't have bought the drive if I had known I wouldn't be able to format the drive. I have a lap top computer, and am incapable of connecting the hard drive inside of it to format the drive to even make it usable again. So I have a nice looking MyBook 500 GB hard drive setting on a desk collecting dust, luckily I had not had that much stuff on the drive yet since I had just purchased it."
1,"Worthless - save the box, you'll be sending it back","This drive is unreliable, the sleep mode will drive you crazy, the software is buggy, and it will cause Windows XP to lock up.The root of the problems seems to be related to the automatic 'sleep' mode the drive goes into after a few minutes of non-use.When the drive goes into sleep mode, Windows XP 'loses' the drive, and your computer will lock up when it tries to read/write to the drive.And according to WD, no way to turn off the automatic sleep mode.With Windows, the drive is virtually useless as a scheduled backup device - because after going into sleep mode, Windows XP will have a difficult time 'waking' the drive to do the backup.If you purchase this drive, save the box. You'll need it when you return the drive."
2,Won't awaken after PowerMac G5 sleeps,"The drive has one important problem. When a PowerMac G5 goes to sleep the drive, connected by Firewire, loses contact. When the Mac wakes a dialog box appears saying that a device has been improperly removed. Since there is no on-off switch on the drive, it is necessary to unplug-replug it. (It doesn't appear to have this problem when connected by USB.) Western Digital does not seem to have implemented Firewire so that it is wholly compatible with Apple products.Update: Other people are reporting sleep problems with these drives, but resetting the PMU on the Mac seems to have fixed it for me. However, the drive too frequently goes to sleep, and there is no way to control this. It is annoying waiting for the drive to waken.Second update: The drive problem has resurfaced with Apple's update to 10.4.9. I'm also having fatal problems with Western Digital's Passport drive. Beware this company's current drives with Macs."
1,NEVER BUY WD HARD DISK AGAIN,"when I wass looking for hard disk to portable and to save all my data , the top ompany in my main was WD(at least in that time) .I bought Western Digital WDG1C5000N My Book Premium Edition 500 GB ,which give big size and fast speed to transfer data and its works fine for some of monthesthen ,with a new day SIMPLY it didnt workall my data thereEVEN MY HONEYMOON PICTURES WAS THEREbut i try to recover many times,even by there software from WD sitebut it looks no usenever buy this prodect againand I may lost my picture of my HONEYMOON be cause of this duumy Prodect"
2,My Book My LOSS,"I purchased the ""my book"" 500GB storage drive. 6 months into backups and then, click, click, click, etc. No Drive. Gone. Can't be fixed, lost data. Switching to a different brand, I suggest the same for anyone buying a backup drive."
1,DON'T BUY THIS DRIVE!!,"I purchased this drive just over one year ago. It has been kept immobile in a protected location; even powered through high quality surge protector. For no apparent reason, the drive failed, and the data is inaccessible. The manufacturer's warranty is only for one year. Especially with the availability of cheap online storage, purchase of such an unreliable drive is sheer lunacy."
1,this hard drive is a true POS,"echoing other reviewers, the drive died unexpectedly - it was used infrequently for archival purposes, so by no means was it overstressed - i will now have to spend anywhere from $1K to $2K to recover the data - in ""my book,"" western digital has soured their reputation for good - i will NEVER buy another WD hard drive again - i wish i could give this product a negative 5 stars"
3,Is a Good option,"Yes, is a Good Option, but I think is very slow tranfer rate.Maybe in the feature, this device be most faster..Transfer some data to this ebook is very slow.I never tested another one, but the smaller External Hard Disk are very faster.."
1,YOU WILL BE SORRY IF YOU BUY WD PRODUCTS!!!,"When I started searching for a high capacity hard drive this was one of toppers in my list. I decided to go for it after reading great reviews on Amazon. I was extremely happy when I received it as it was my first 500G drive. It was fine for the first six months, it started acting up after that. It would not be recognizable unless I reboot my computer and then finally died on me on one fine day!Just imagine if I SUCK at my job, how would I be able feed my family?!?!? You would think you rely on a company which ONLY specializes in hard drives. How could you let us down? That means you REALLY SUCK at your day job! Thankfully I have been using computers long enough to understand the risk and make multiple backups. But think of those who believe in companies like these.Hey if you think about it, it is better for the company isn't it? One HD lost is one HD bought! Pathetic!!!Go for IOMEGA or LACIE instead."
1,Don't even think of buying this,"When I discovered this device only backs up in it's own encrypted format, I called tech support. The tech, in India, he told me, could hardly speak English. After a frustrating 10-mintues, I asked to speak to his supervisor; whose English was marginally better.15-minutes later, I asked the same question: ""Can I back up in native format."" Round and round we went for ten-minutes before he told me to return this and get an upgraded (i.e.: more expensive unit) so I can do that.I don't think so. I'll return it and get a Maxtor.I'd pass on this unless you don't want to have easy access to your backed up files."
2,yea ok?,"Perhaps it's just me, but this product is not exactly what I thougth it would be... I thought I could move programs and such on to it while I clean up my computers hard drive etc. Oh by the way I have a Mac so maybe this only happens on Mac's...any how I go to move things and this drive suddenly tells me... you can't move this as file name is to long or file name can't be used. OK??? As for the unit it's self it's sort of loud and slow at wake up when it goes to sleep. Perhaps I just expcet too much?"
2,Good for media but not for OS or programs,"As the earlier reviews mentioned it is easy to use and the documentation is only 2 pages. It works fine for media files but it isn't very good for backing up the OS or programs files. The software although easy to use is a bit sloppy. During a backup if it finds a file it doesn't like for one reason or another it kills the entire backup and you have to hunt down the ""bad"" file and fix or remove it. After 5 days of trying to get a 40GB backup I've had to resort to moving them folder by folder. It also will not work if you don't have XP service pack 1 installed. You may want to consider a spare HD, external case and a main stream backup software program."
5,Nice,"I'll make this review quick and dirty.It's extremely quiet, very fast, looks good, takes up very little space, easy to install and use, and holds a ton of stuff. I use it exclusively to hold my photos( up to a couple thousand so far). I shoot mainly in RAW so they're all large files. Of course the price is right, under a buck per gig.This unit is the ticket. Look no further. Buy it."
2,"Mediocre hardware, horrible software, pathetic support","While WD would like you to believe the drive is 100% Vista compliant, it isn't. The provided backup software crashes or will not run in ""Advanced"" mode in Vista (on a brand new Vista PC). The drive is slow, and Vista warns all the time of an incompatibilty issue with the driver. I have contacted WD support and there ONLY response is to ""see our online knowledgebase"".The good news... It does work (with Vista) as long as you don't rely on the WD backup software."
4,My Book Premium 500,I bought this product to use with Leopards built in backup software Time Machine. So far it has worked as expected. I did not use the supplied software that it came with so I can't speak to that but if you want a good backup drive for a great price I would definitely recommend it. It has been very easy to use... just plug in the supplied Firewire cable and Time Machine does the rest.
3,Backup software is slow - IF YOU DONT REFORMAT TO NTFS,"I bought this drive and ran the backup software to back up all of my music and pictures automatically. Then ran it the first time. 2 hours later it is still running. I only had 10G of data to record. It turns out that the backup software apparantly transfers data in large blocks of data that the FAT32 formatting does not handle well (FAT32 has a 4G limit). If you reformat the hard drive to NTFS, however, it will backup MUCH faster. Most drives come formatted NTFS.If you keep the drive formatted in FAT32 (and I dont know why you would), then MANUALLY backing up - by dragging and dropping, it will work MUCH faster. Less than 10 minutes (I didn't time it but it was MUCH better-else I would have returned it). So Western Digital - either make your backup software smarter or just format the hard drive to NTFS. Hey WD - how about FIXING this!!!!!"
2,"Too many problems, no matter how easy to set up","I have had my MY Book for over 6 months. A review done when a product is fresh out of the box doesn't tell you much about the longevity of the machine or how it functions down the road. I was SO EXCITED to get this. I have tons of photos and video that I wanted to back up and remove from my computer. Thankfully I backed all of my photos up on DVDs too. They are gone from the external drive. One day there was a cyclical redundancy thing going on and I could not access my folder. Since then I have had other issues, many that people have mentioned already. I really don't want to have to go out and get another external drive, but this one truly is not reliable. Half the time I go to access it my computer thinks it is not there (both with firewire & USB) There are disk write failures all of the time and I never know when the drive will actually work."
2,causes trouble,"This drive has ended up being more trouble than it's worth. It' works ok *most* of the time, but when I was on XP the drive would randomly suddenly pretend to windows that it has no files (easily gets you scared). Disconnecting the drive and reconnecting it fixes temporaly. Also sometimes the harddisk never sleeps, and stays spinning at a high-rate all the time, unless unplugged from the machine.I recently upgraded to a new vista machine, and hoped that the issues with the drive would cease, but now I just get blue-screens complaining about usb or ieee power management. I've definitely pinned this down to the drive, as i never get this issue with it plugged in.All in all, I recommend staying away from this drive. As soon as I can I'll be buying a replacement and copying all my data from this drive to the new one, as I no longer trust this drive holding my data."
1,Horrible model - needs to be recalled,"Completely unreliable & unstable. Bought this to use as a backup drive to save family photos, videos, etc. Drive decides when and if it wants to turn on, when/if it gets recognized by my comp, etc. Have tried this thing with multiple PCs with the same poor results. Remarkably undependable product."
2,Unreliable,"Bought the drive in 2008 as primary backup for music and data files prior to moving to new computer. Worked great out of the box initially, however 6 months later it started to behave erratically. Could not power down with button in front, could not un-mount from Windows. Finally determined that the drive overheats very quickly and becomes erratic with extended use. Works fine if you take the cover off and put a cooling blanket (ice pack in plastic bag) on top of actual drive. Just make sure there are no holes! Won't buy WD external again."
1,Terrible. 2 models have died on me.,I have had a terrible experience with this Western Digital My Book. The original failed approximately 3 months after I got it. I called Western Digital and had them RMA me a new one. I really had to push hard to get them to cover the shipping on it. They wanted me to pay to send the faulty one back. I asked to speak with a supervisor and he quickly arranged a UPS preprinted label to be emailed to me.The replacement model has now failed in a similar manner approximately 1 year after I got it. I'm not going to bother trying a third.
2,Poor Drive- Good for About 1 Year of Light use,"Used as a backup device for about 1 year. Now it is failing sporadically. Disk utilities come back with hardware type errors. Looks like it's almost dead. This drive was used for backups only- so it ran every night for an hour or two and then went to sleep. This means we got- at BEST 1000 hours use out of the drive before it died, and it was not ""heavy"" use like video editing or server work. This seems typical for these WD drives. We will not buy another ""MyBook"" drive from WD."
1,Lost all my data...,"This drive worked great - until I woke up one morning and discovered that it would no longer mount. I was unable to do a software recovery of the data, now I'm spending big bucks to send the drive to a speciciast to get my data. Do not buy this drive. The same thing happened to two other close friends with the exact same drive. DANGER!"
1,Intrinsic hardware issues.,"There have been many complaints of this drive. I am not the only one that has experienced it ""simply stop working."" Do not buy this drive because it will break down on you for no known reason."
2,Unreliable,"The product worked fine and I was able to make weekly backups of my data and life was good. Then in just under 1 year it suddenly stopped working, I was unable to access the drive and all the data was lost. (it was just a backup, so I really did not loose anything). For a while I could not communicate with the drive at all, then one day it came back to life, and my system could see it, except that it saw it as a unformated drive. So I formated it believing that all would be well again and that only a glitch had happened. But after formating I was unable to write to the drive, so it is useless."
1,Defective and Terrible Customer Service,"While the product itself seems to be stylish and a good value, mine never transferrred data reliably with any of my Windows computers and refused to power on after a week. WD customer support was so slow that I was forced to return it back to Amazon and purchase a different product. Perhaps a one of a kind flaw, but enough to make me never purchase from this manufacturer again."
1,BEWARE,Since day one the drive was temperamental about shutdown and also about showing up in the MyComputer list of drives. The safe shutdown button sometimes worked and sometimes didn't. Ocassionally it would not go off automatically with computer shutdown. Of course it is out of warranty and it no longer shows up in the drive list even tho the WD button appears on the bottom tool bar. There is a click when it starts up and it will cost me at least $300 to get my photos and videos off of it. I won't buy another.
1,Didn't Work!,It crashed the first time while loading some data and never worked again. I had to send back. It has been a few weeks and I have not received a working one yet.
5,Snap to use,"The ""My Book"" was really easy to set up and use. I did reformat the drive, and then used it to copy files from one PC to another. The Firewire installed its own driver, and worked without any intervention on my part. Definately a 5 star product."
1,Failed after a year,Same thing happened to me. Worked for about a year before suddenly failing costing me all the data on the drive.
2,BEWARE Mac users,"DO NOT PLACE THE WD SOFTWARE on your Mac. Do NOT use it. You'll be really sorry if you do. For 10.4.x users, you may be tempted to use their free supplied backup software. DON'T DO IT. And if you have 10.5.x and need additional backup schemes to TM, get a .mac account which allows backing up to external drives and doing that via multiple different plans and schedules and drive choices. WD did not use standard Apple operating procedure in writing its software such that removing it from your system is well nigh impossible without re-installing the OS and I do not mean archive and install but REinstalling altogether. The drive is good but the software is horrible."
1,Failed after one year,Similar to other reviews. Loud clicks and Can not recognize by Windows XP after about 1 year of use. I will spent more $ to recover the data.
5,Great product at a great price,"Great drive that is very quite. I originally purchased this hard drive to hook up to Apple Airport Extreme for Time Machine, however now that they came out with Time Capsule I would have purchased that instead. Live and learn, but this is a great external hard drive. No complaints thus far. (2+ months)"
2,Problems Mounting with OS X,"Consistently won't mount with my MacBook Pro. (i.e. you can't see it when you plug it in.)The support forums are littered with reports of people with similar problems. I have to fiddle, fiddle, fiddle, almost despaiing that my files are gone for good... before finally getting teh darn thing to mount. Too much trouble and too unreliable. If they fixed the mounting problem.. or had decent support... they'd have a good product. But they haven't and they don't."
3,MyBook Firewire Drive,"Good product. Worked right out of the box. However, after capturing 20 minutes of video, I received an error stating that it failed to save the information. After troubleshooting, I was able to determine that the drive was formatted in FAT32, which as a file limit (4 or 5 GB) per file. So I had to transfer my footage to another drive and re-format to NTFS, which does not have a file size limit. It would have been nice if the manufacturer had stated this file size limit in the packaging."
2,The child of this one 1TB not a happy one,"After reading good things here, I bought the 1TB version. Yes easy to install, copy the provided progrmas to a backup CD and reformat to ntsf. But then the problems start, especially with Vista. WD warns that their WD start software has to be restarted due to Vista stopping it, no problems here. Set up your back-up using their software, ok easy to do. Frist backup is good. NOW you come back a day later, the drive is off line, autobackup is waiting on the drive to be online. You have to MANUALLY bring the drive back up, the supplied WD software grabs 1/2 of your ram, and starts to verify what is on the drive. YOUR PC starts to crawl even tho the setting is set to let other programs run first, it does not release the memory, in my case 1GB ram. I find that autoback up never works because the drive is never active when it needs to run, like at night. STAY away from this VERSION WD is misleading the public with the 1TB drive and software!"
1,"Excellent but for a very premature, terminal failure.","Though this product looked nice and worked just as I hoped straight from the box, it failed. I used the drive to keep a back up image of my computer and it was only switched on once every two weeks but after it had been used only 32 times (and I suppose that is about a month of normal usage)the drive failed to start. WD could not assist other than to help recover the data at a prohibitive cost."
1,No Good,"I used this maybe 5 times, long enough to fill it a third full. One day I was saving a file and got the 'Write Delayed Failure' message. Next thing I know, it's telling me that the drive isn't formatted, and would I like to format it now. What?! Where did all my files and information go?? I thought Western Digital was a good name but I certainly won't be buying from them again!"
1,Awful,The drive came unformatted and unaccessable. The OS (XP) read that it was there but it was completely useless. Very similar to many others around the web that have purchased this product before.
4,"large capacity, easy to use","This 500Gb external drive is great for the person that has never replaceda hard drive before.It's easy to hook up and can work with any computer with a 2.0 USB portor firewire connection.The one thing I have found is it upsets or makes the shutdown ofWindows XP hang and sometimes not shutdown completely requiringa hard reboot to get it to shut down.I would say this happens 1 out of 25 shutdowns so I can live with havingthis problem and gaining the large 500Gb drive.If you have the know how to install an internal drive, I say do that.For ease of use, this is very much for the novice."
4,This thing is great...Just wish it came with some backup sw.,"This thing is great but I just wish it came with some back up software. I ended up using Ghost which works fine, but for the price it works great."
4,great little quiet drive,"I've been using this little guy to backup my laptop as well as a near-line storage device, and it works great, no problems at all. It has USB & Firewire ports, but I only have USB on my laptop. I really like it's quietness, if it weren't for the lights on the front I'd never know if it were on or not... no fans either, and it doesn't get too warm, but I've got it on a shelf with a lot of ventilation. And for my needs it's more than fast enough... I don't think I'd use it for video editing, but for file access it seems as quick as my laptop's drive. How much do I like it? I'm considering buying another!"
1,Failed Quickly - even in light use. Spend more - save your stuff!,"Even in light use (no video, etc.) in a safe, well-ventilated installation spot, this drive failed in very short order.AVOID. Spend more - buy better drives."
1,Drive failure out of the box,"I just purchased one of these because I'm counting down the space on my computer, especially now that I'm doing home movie editing on it. I thought this would be the perfect storage solution for my photo, video and audio files. However, I was a little leery. Good Thing! As people have noted, it is ridiculously easy to set up. But, I did notice right away a nasty vibration. It had my whole desk throbbing. Mmmm. I wondered if that was normal. Decided to live with it a few days before transferring files. Good thing - The morning of the third day, no power. Dead player. No lights, no nothing. The thing just croaked! So glad I hadn't moved my files! I purchased it elsewhere and will be returning it pronto. I'll not be buying another. I'll try a different brand this time. Too bad, I was so excited. I'd give it no stars, but that wasn't a choice."
1,Disc Drive Failure,"I had my book for about 2 weeks. After I had loaded a back up of all my personal information, the drive would not power up. The blue lights would only blink. The option I was offered was to send it to Irving and have them look at it under the warranty consideration. There was no way I was going to send my drive with everything about me on it to some mailing address.I took the drive case apart to see if I could salvage the drive and found that the power and sata connections are proprietary so I will have to adapt the connections to use it somewhere else, if it works. I wont get another."
4,"Good product, some minor issues","Overall this is a great hard drive. The dual interface is a nice feature. Sometimes, however, the drive refuses to turn off via it's built in button on the front."
5,external hardrive,"I love the harddrive. The only complaint I have, is that you have to manually copy over iTunes TV shows and movies. In fact, most of the items I want to copy over require it to be done manually. However, it is easy and so far reliable. Love the plug and play."
5,GREAT FOR STORAGE & BACKUPS,"I now have two of these(1 250g & 1 500g) and they are great!!if you want to add space to your computer without hassle,get one of these!!!**update** 5 years later and these drives are still going strong!!"
1,It died a week after the warranty expired,"My WD 500Gb ""Premium Edition"" just died a week after the warranty expired. This hard drive has been a piece of junk since day one, all I have now is piece of garbage that makes annoying clicks when you turn it on; boy you talk about trowing $$$.$$ down the drain. DO NOT waste your money on any of these external drives made by Western Digital."
1,Disappointing External Hard Drive,"I bought this for my son who is in the Army in Iraq. After copying 300 GB of data to it for his use on his personal time, the drive will not shut off when the computer is turned off. I have been out of state and have not reported it to Western Digital, who may be able to resolve the problem with a replacement or better instructions."
4,Bongos,I ordered this in the rainforest fabric and it came in a fabric with people on it. Other than that I am pleased with the product.
3,happy kid,"We purchased these for our 2 yr old son, he's almost 3, along with the Remo rubber mallet. The construction seems sturdy, and our son loves to bang away on these. If they are standing on the ground the sound is a litle flat vs if you hold them up on your lap but we've been pretty happy."
4,Bongo drums have great beat,the seller was great at communicating when they were going to ship the item out and the bongos came in great condition.

5,Planet-Pets.com Recommended,"Whether you are an established bird enthusiast or have just bought your first bird, The Complete Bird Owner's Handbook covers everything a bird lover may need to know to raise healthy birds. An extensive References section provides advice on many species."
3,"Schizophrenic, but done fairly well.","There is a niche for books of advice to bird owners. There is also a niche for reference booksabout avian anatomy, medicine, and feeding. This book rather awkwardly tries to fill both atonce. I can't imagine finding both halves useful at the same time, but it does a decent job of each."
3,"Not exactly complete, but a good beginner's guide","This guide provides general advice concening nutrition, medicine, and equipment for pet birds, but it doesn't cover any topic in great detail. If you are interested in reading about the pros and cons of different species, keep shopping. This book covers species characteristics in an all-too-brief appendix. Also, this book is mostly aimed at the hookbills - parrots, cockatoos, budgies, etc. If you are interested in finches, mynahs, canaries and the like, you might find this book to be inadequate. However,I found this book to be very useful when I first got my parrot, and I still peruse it from time to time, especially the sections on diagnosing illness and medical care."
5,A Must for Bird Owners,"I found this book to be quite informative on all of the most common bird health problems. It describes diseases and problems and tells how to remedy these problems on your own or lets you know when you should quarantine your bird or seek veterinary help. It also shows you how to deal with things such as nail and feather clipping etc. It is written in a format that is very easy for everyone to understand. In my opinion this book is a must for every bird owner, no matter what kind of bird you own you will find alot of useful information here."
5,Free and Clear,"Best money I have spent in long time. My husband and I were part way there and this is the best resource we have found to take us the rest of the way. We are seeking to be be more finacial free of the stresses as we reach the middle of life with our family. It is the guide we have been seeking to assist us. Best of all Free and Clear is written on the foundation of God's word which doesn't change, is never outdated and with our best at heart. We bought it with the three pack of Howard Dayton books."
3,predictable - yes - but terribly entertaining!,"Is this predictable? YES! Yet, is it cheesy to the core and entertaining? YES! Here, Peter Cushing is great - though not at his best - and the supporting csat is cheesy enough to carry this Hammer entry.There is only one problem - the monster himself looks rather mediocre. If anything, this is an insult to the fans.Yet, in all, this one is a cheesy, guilty treat."
4,great Hammer fun,"This is not Shakespeare, but then I don't want it to be. It's gloriously Hammer all the way -- Colour remakes and sequels to the originals with the legends Lee and Cushing.Where Lee and Cushing battled it out in the Dracula series, Cushing made the good doctor his own in a number films all directed by the brilliant Terrance Fisher--save this one. Freddie Francis took over direction on this film for some reason. So it has a different flavour than the other Cushing Frankenstein films, while still being very Hammer.Still, it has enough power to deliver a Hammer good time! It's loaded with bouts of really corny dialogue - but then we LOVE that in these B-flicks.A must for Hammer or Cushing addicts."
3,A very underrated Hammer film,"Fred Francis(who never received the credit he deserved for this film or for ""Dracula Has Risen from the Grave"") took over the directing reins from Terence Fisher for this, Hammer's third Frankenstein film. With his masterful use of dark lighting and dungeon like sets, Francis creates a very moody, dark, atmosphere. The film is slightly weak on plot, with a rather uninspired story involving a side show hypnotist. But as any Hammer fan knows, it's all about atmosphere. And this movie has it in spades. That along with a characteristically fine performance from Cushing makes this a worthy watch for any Hammer fan."
1,A GREAT Guilty Pleasure!,"As you, or may not know, this was the only Frankenstein film starring Peter Cushing that was not directed by Horror maestro Terence Fisher. Instead the workman-like Freddie Francis steps in for old Terry(who was apprently sick at the time) And delievers a sort of quase-shawshbuckler-mad scientist movie. Not special or in-depth like Fisher's entries, but a fun sleazy gulity pleasure trip. Francis imbues the film with a gritty damp feel, quit unlike the earlier entrys or later ones, contrasted in John Wilcox's flat photogaphy. And Anthony Hinds's poorly scripted screenplay (one of his worst) manages to conjure up some absurd snappy diolouge, that will keep any Bad-cinema buff entertained.Unfortunetly this guilty treat is not avaiable in it's un-cut format, which consists of scense shot from TV upon it;s original TV airing. Though these cut, or added scenes (which ever you like to term them) can be seen on AMC, whenever they happen to air it."
2,Big Name Studio Attempts to ruin a clasic series,"The third entry to the Hammer films Frankenstein series is unfortunately soiled by the fact that the first two did well on there own without the backing of a major studio. Universal gave the rights for the look of the Karloff monster and Hammer films should have said, No thanks! Completely ruins the continuity of the first films, I can't say enough of how the monster itself just brings shame as it is supposed to be the original creature played by Christopher Lee. The sets are great, in true Hammer fashion. Purchase for completing your Hammer collection, Pass on it if you like the series but are not into purchasing movies. Pass on it because if you rent it you won't want to see the others."
5,My Favorite One,I'm sorry but EVIL OF FRANKENSTEIN entertained me more than CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN or REVENGE OF FRANKENSTEIN not that terence fisher is a bad director this one had a better story people throw this one out of the window because it doesn't follow from the first 2 who cares as far as i'm concerned you don't watch the hammer frankenstein movies to see how it picks up or follows from the last one if you ask me the dumbmest one in the series with Peter Cushing was FRANKENSTEIN CREATED WOMAN in that one they just tried to do a rehash of BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN
2,Dr.Stein thaws creature and experiment goes wrong.,"First of all,the monster looks like it came out of Dracula Vs Frankenstein.And if you saw the prequels then you can tell that the story is wrong.Stein tells his assistant how he first gave his creation life.But,it just doesn't go together.On the other hand,Peter Cushing is great(as usual)as Dr.Frankenstein.Watch the opening sequence(with the credits)and you can see he really means business.Overall,a not-so-bad film.If you're a fan of Hammer Frankenstein films,watch this one just to piece the other ones together.If you're looking for a at-night-with-popcorn-film it's not this one."
5,"First Keyboard, dad bought as a kid to learn, still have, still my only one","Dad got it for me around 10, i stopped playing for about 6 years now and i feel bad.I'm mostly doing this review, i doubt anyone will read this for the upcoming rock band 3. I hope to take this out, buy an adapter for the game and rock out without using that small fake rb3 keyboard.Love this keyboard, i never learned to appreciate the hard earned money my dad paid for it at full price years back, quick google says you can get this keyboard used for about $60, i still think thats a lot and thats about 3 times as less my dad paid.Love my dad thank you to introducing me into music, i didn't appreciate it as a kid, i've missed my music opportunity with the keyboard but i hope to play it recreationaly along with the guitar, violin, heck maybe the flute as a successful adult!"
5,Excellent Purchase~,"This has turned out to be a better gift than expected. I bought it for the lighted keys and training. the programming in the keyboard is amazing. it includes background music when learning, a voice to tell you what finger to use, a time keeper, many music options. The company that shipped the part also included the adapter which has been a huge help. I would buy again in a heartbeat!"
2,Be Aware before you buy,"I brought this product from Toys R US for my daughter for christmas. I got it no batteries (off course) and no power adapter either. The manual says it is optional but in fine print. We had to buy batteries on a separate trip. Next I am trying to buy the adapter, Amazon nor Toys R US know what to recommend for the power adapter. This is just a ridiculous buy I would strongly recommend that you buy both the keyboard only if it comes with a power adapter and a stand. This is expensive and not worth it. I am planning on returning it and going for a yamaha keyboard."
3,Conjugal release,"Statue of Justice/Crime of Passion/Chamber of Horrors/Birdman of Alcatraz/The Breathalyser/Judas IscariotOriginally released fall 1977 on A&M; (I have the LP). Only a thousand or two of this CD have been pressed. Apart from some spoken word and a large Swiss choir chanting on ""Judas Iscariot"", this is another instrumental release. This was recorded in Switzerland, where Rick was living as a tax dodge at the time. ""White Rock"" had been released earlier that year. There was no solo album in 1978. Rick was also back in Yes (second of five times!; Chris Squire and Alan White cameo here). A woman found at a local pub was brought in to scream at the end of ""Chamber of Horrors""."
3,Who ripped what from whom?,"So, the opening pipe organ theme from, I believe, Judas Iscariot-- is it not the same theme as in Andrew Lloyd Weber's Phantom of the Opera? Or maybe it was 'borrowed' without credit from an even older composer."
3,"Ok Clock, Could Not Get Signal Though","This clock is smaller than you think it will be, trust me. Other than that the product is pretty much what you see. Keep in mind the clock backlight does not stay on constantly, only when you hit the snooze/light button. Also, the projection does stay on constantly if you use the AC adapter, but it is not adjustable independently of the clock. In other words, you have to rotate the clock to rotate the projected time. Also I could never seem to get the atomic clock radio signal. I had to set it manually, but that may just be my geographical area. My town forbids radio towers, etc. For the price do i recommend this clock? If you just need a basic projection clock then yes, otherwise spring for a bit more."
2,Not so good,"The single disfunctional thing about this alarm clock is that the alarm itself requires 2 AA batteries, which seem to last a month or less. The projector doesn't take batteries, the clock itself doesn't require batteries to keep time...and there's really no way you'll know that it's time to replace the batteries until OOPS you over slept because the alarm didn't go off. Bad design. I bought mine last summer, I'm on line looking to buy a new one (one that doesn't suck, hopefully) and saw this one, figured I'd write this review. My opinion; if you just want to see the time on your ceiling, it works great. If you need an alarm clock, skip this item."
5,Excellent clock!,"We love this clock! We've always purchased Oregon Scientific clocks for our alarm and travel clocks. The digital projection in red is amazingly clear and won't wake us up when we look at the time. The great thing is that both of us can see the time on the ceiling when I tap the snooze bar. No more nudging and saying, ""what time is it?""."
4,Oregon Scientific atomic alarm clock,"This alarm clock has all the functions I was looking for, but the look isn't all that appealing to me. The projection on to the ceiling is clear, but over time, the brightness fades (I own another one and it's slightly dimmer than the one I just purchased)."
3,It's nice...But...,"Living in Arizona we have this issue...Actually every other state in the nation has it..It's called DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME...So the clock automatically assumes that we are on DLST and it moves the time. So my kiddo's managed to get up an hour early one day. Which is alright except being an atomic clock it took forever before I could get it to set correctly.The one good thing is the alarm however which goes off, and then gradually get's a little louder..Making it so once I can hear it, that means the kids are still NOT out of bed..and it's time for me to go pull them out of bed."
4,i like it,"the alarm is on my side of the bed, and my husband was tired of looking over me in the middle of the night to see what time it was.....so this was my solution - rather than have two clocks [we have the same schedule]. it would be nice if you could move the projector - but it really isn't a big deal to me. it is very visible."
1,Never got the product,"My order was canceled with no explanation! Guess I won't get to find out if this product was any good or not. The company ""ANTonline"" didn't come through for me."
4,It does the trick,"I needed an inexpensive mouse. Although smaller than I imagined. It works great and for the money, I am very happy."
1,I REMEMBER SEEING AND LIKING THIS MOVIE 30 YEARS AGO,"So, I bought it, viewed it and realized that it was THE VILLAIN I saw/liked. This movie isthe personification of why studios shelve movies. A boring mush of wasted star power,illogical , unfocused characterizations, plotting and irritating meaninglessness.Now, to go buy THE VILLAIN and revisit a cynical, black-humored, hopefully funnywestern of the Golden Seventies."
4,That pretty schoolteacher..,"On one of the discussion boards was a question about the pretty schoolteacher being carried along with the rioting mob, losing another piece of attire every time seen (yelling ""warden,"" asking for help) for part of the riot sequence and then disappearing. And mention of seeing a still picture where she wore a hat, boots and a smile while running through the desert. Question was about the editing.An acquaintance saw the sneak preview of the picture in Long Beach while it was still being edited and mentioned that the striptease continued until she was chased into the desert through the hole dynamited in the prison wall.Should there ever be a DVD released with this ""deleted scene,"" you let us all know, you all. (But after forty or fifty years, doubtful.)"
5,Exceptional CD,"This is a wonderful mix of traditional (Eyes on the Prize, We Shall Not Be Moved etc.) and original recordings (My Own Eyes, I'll Be Rested etc.). Traditional renditions, Gospel, Soul, Folk, R&B; all combined with wonderful, soulful singing with excellent collaboration from Ry Cooder, Jim Keltner etc.Along with the exceptional music, this CD should make all of us appreciate how far we've come and still need to go (in many areas of life). One of the best CDs of 2007 to date.Should make you want to clap your hands and sing."
3,Not as gripping as her live recording,This recording was overproduced - mushy lifeless arrangements. Thank you Ry.The later live recording of much of this set ( minus Ry's influence thank God )Live: Hope At The Hideoutis much more funky and rewarding
4,Mavis Gets Real,"This is a great c.d.,those of us who remember the civil rights movement of the 60s, will especially like it , although anyone can.It has a real analog type tone, earthy and bluesy and speaks of real important feelings and the life and times of sooo many of our fellow countryman.This is a real good c.d. shes done ""good stuff here"""
2,Too Preachy,"Musically, this album is great, thats why I bought it. The truth is that every song is about the civil rights movement. If thats your thing then go ahead, you'll love it. But personally, its a song and dance I've heard too many times. I realized that every time a song from this album played on my mp3 player, I skipped it. After a while I ended up deleting it. Wish I could get money back."
5,Review for CD (We'll Never Turn Back),I love this CD! Thank you for your quick response. It arrived in perfect condition. Thanks so much.
3,Yes and no,"A tribute to the legacy of the Civil Rights movement and the Staple Singers themselves. Doesn't really live up to the hype, though. Mavis has still got the drive and passion, but her voice doesn't have the range and nuance."
3,I am sure it's a fine filter but it does not fit the MB C230 1.8 engine,"I ordered this item and in the process of completing the oil change I found that it is not the right filter for the Mercedes Benz C230 1.8 Kompressor engine. It is listed as a fit for that vehicle on the site; but I believe it must be the filter for the V6 engines not the I4. Just wanted to let anyone else know about this as I had to run out locally and scrounge up a filter to complete the job. After that inconvenience I had to deal with a return to Amazon that resulted in a refund for a lot less than I paid for the item. So the mix up cost me twice since I paid more locally and then received less than I paid on the return. Not a huge amount of money, but on the principal of the matter I am a annoyed as I would not have purchased this part in the first place if it was listed properly on Amazon."
5,Must Read,"Unlike many self help books, this book is written very concisely and gets to the point making it very easy, enjoyable, and quick to read. The biblical references and examples are very helpful too. This book has helped me tremendously. I think anyone getting married at any age for the first time should read this book."
5,Makes you feel great!,My whole family loves this song! The kids play it every morning before school (and sometimes I play it when their not home!) because it makes you feel like you can accomplish anything that day.Can't wait to read the book.
3,Very good condition with the cover taped on?,"I was very disapointed with the condition of the book. I would not expect a book rated ""Very Good"" condition to have the cover held on with 30-year-old tape that disintegrated when I opened the cover. I would never buy from this seller again."
1,Horrible,"This is the worst iron I had so far. I had cheap irons before but none had these many problems as this one. It is supposed to be non-drip, forget about it! It leaks all over the place. Plate does not heat up properly so it`s hard to get a nice crease. I don`t recommend this iron to anybody."
4,Good iron for the price,I purchased this same iron at Target 3months ago and I use it everyday. I didn't experience the problems the previous reviewer had. I find this iron to be a pretty decent one. I had a Rowenta and paid double the price and was so disappointed when it leaked constatntly. It was one of the worst irons I owned. I would think twice before I buy another Rowenta.This Sundbeam iron is a good one and the steam is strong and I haven't experienced any leaks. I use this iron everyday and I am very satisfied.
1,Worst iron I ever owned,"This has to be the worst iron I ever owned.It claims to be leakless, but it leaked every time I used it.It would leak and stain our clothing.The sole would also develop a coating of residue. I have been using a new Panasonic iron for three weeks now and have NONE of the same problems I had with this iron.Sure, it looks nice, but it's not worth the space it took up."
4,Small Drive - Big Value,"I love this little guy! I have had it in my bag for 8 months now, and it has 'saved the day' more than once. I am a consultant and am on the road 100% of the time, so I was looking for something light, compact and durable.Pros:- Smaller and lighter than similar drives (as compared to those of my colleagues)- Does not require additional power source (on my laptop anyway)- Preloaded backup software- Very much ""plug and play""; have used it on 7+ computers and all recognized and accessed the drive right away- Detatchable USB cable: a plus since I can use the same cable to connect other devices (PDA)Cons:- Read/write speed is a little slower than I expected (but it is USB after all) but on par with others I have used.- That's it!"
2,Mini USB Connector,"This drive is fantastic except for one GIANT design flaw -- it uses ONE MINI USB connector!I also own a firewire version of the same drive, and it has two full-sized firewire connectors. It was a huge disappointment to receive the USB version with only one connector, and a non-standard size at that!The advertised benefit of this product is that you can keep it in your bag, and ""save the day"" when needed. Having a connector that uses a non-standard connector size, and not being able to grab any USB cable laying around to use the product unfortunately cripples this device."
5,Wow!!,"This is my first portable hard drive, and after 6 months I am still very pleased with it. It's a very convenient size so you can take your music and files with you wherever you go, and it is also plug and play, which means that you can access files without having to install software on every computer you use it with. Another good feature is that it works for both PCs or Macs. It's also useful as a backup hard drive to protect music files and docs in case your main computer fails."
1,Smart Disk,The disk failed the first week after being used as a backup. All data was lost. The manufacturer was cooperative in replacing with a rebuilt disk. I could have bought a refurbished disk to start with and saved considerable money. I do not have enough time yet on this refurbished disk to evaluate the product.
5,Foundations of Faithless,"The first of the three albums contains all of Faithless' singles not released on the band's other albums (including Woozy, Addictive, & and Maxi Jazz's collaboration My Culture). The 2nd CD seems to contain a set of songs that have more influenced Faithless' club hits (Insomnia, Salva Mea, God is a DJ, etc.) The 3rd CD contains songs which seem to probably have been more of an influence to Maxi Jazz and his knack for lyrical poetry and rap influences. I would say that this is an excellent album for those out there who want to get to know some of Faithless' most influential and foundational music."
2,"Cheap, don't buy","Two cheap frames, two pieces of paper, and an ink pad. Better to get some pretty frames, cut some white paper and get an inkpad for .79 cents. To the other reviewer - I'm sorry for your loss. It's good that you got the prints before your baby passed away."
5,Awesome!,"I used this product to treat the rust in my John Deere riding mower's mowing deck. The thin layer that I applied, has become a very SOLID unbreakable barrier/layer. It is incredibly hard when it dries. Highly recommended."
3,An Indispensable Reference Despite the Flaws,"The author has carefully gathered a prodigious amount of historical material - much of it inaccessable to all but a few polyglots, some of it entirely inaccessable because of the sources in the church hierarchy or archives. While his presentation of all this raw matter and, above all, the length of this work are not the most felicitous, there is no doubt that this book is destined to be the indispensable reference. Down the road others will perhaps produce out of this mass one or more reader-friendly volumes, but they'll all have to start with this foundational work."
2,Dog loved it until it broke,"My dog absolutely loved this toy... for 10 minutes until it broke. :-( My dog is a 1 year old 25 pound Plott Hound / Beagle MixIf it was made out of a slightly stronger material, it would be much better."
2,Cool while it lasted,"I bought the 8in one that is red and it lasted a week.I have a 65lb lab that is 7 months old who loved it! You just have to make sure they don't sit there and chew it; it's NOT a chew toy! I put a ball in it and it challenged her to try and get it out (she would work on it all day).I would not buy it again, however If you do, monitor the dog at all times because once it starts chewing it, the ball will break and it breaks In large chunks that are very bad if swallowed"
1,Not tough enough for my German Shepherd,"I bought this because other reviewers said how tough it is but my German Shepherd easily tore it to bits pretty quickly. The toughest toys I've found are Kongs. This toy is nowhere near, not even close, to being as tough as a Kong."
1,Way too delicate,"It took my dog under 10 minutes to completely destroy this toy. He had pieces chewed off of it so fast, it was amazing. I put it in the garbage in under 10 minutes on Christmas morning."
2,Fun toy...until it was destroyed 5 minutes later,"I bought this ball for my 8 year old lab mix for enrichment purposes. He was thrilled when I stuffed it with a few biscuits to start. He rolled it every which way then decided it would be best to tug on it. It ripped almost in half. Good thing I bought it online for half the price of the pet store, or it may have been more tragic."
3,Not happy in Illinois,"This is a good toy and the one I have is great but I now have 2 dogs and need another ball. I ordered the smallest ball listed, it stated for puppies and toy breeds. The one I received although states small/petit is not what I ordered it is for a dog at lease 60 pounds or more. I am giving to my daughter for her dog. Now I still have no ball for my other 12 pound dog. Thank's a lot."
1,Waste of money.,"Got destroyed in under an hour, new record. Thought it would be good for my teething puppy, I was wrong."
2,Holee molee roller - Not for Bull Terriers,"This product (holee molee roller)was disappointing. My 8 month old Bull Terrier had destroyed it in about 5 minutes. He absolutely loved it, but the product proved incapable of standing up to his powerful jaws. It broke into little bits which he then tried to chew and swallow. If you have a dog with strong jaws and a strong will, then this is not a suitable toy. I am going to try the holee molee extreme and hope this product fairs better against my dog's powerful chewing."
3,"Large version not durable, small version is","My dog is a 2-year old shiba inu. The breed is not a large breed (even if she is large for a shiba inu-she's taller and heavier than males are supposed to be to be AKC). However, I bought her the small and large versions. The small one has worked wonderfully for the past almost year and a half. The large one, though, she absolutely shredded within minutes of us giving it to her. The ball looked more like flat, partially unwound DNA.This toy is perfectly fine for dogs that don't chew aggressively, but my dog has actually destroyed Kongs before. And she's only 17 pounds!"
1,Completely destroyed in half an hour.,"My dachshund is a chewer, and I THOUGHT this toy would be fairly durable, but she had chunks of it all over my bed and now the toy isn't even a ball anymore, it's just completely destroyed. I don't recommend this toy to anyone who has a dog that chews and destroys toys a lot. Get it if your dog plays with toys rather than chew them, because this toy is not nearly as durable as they claim it is."
1,"Smells funny, dog destroyed it in minutes!","Maybe mine was defective, but it was very soft, so soft that my retriever destroyed it in minutes. It also had a chemical smell, like a bad China factory. It was in the garbage can five minutes after I got it."
1,Unlucky toy,"Well, Lucky's toys aren't so lucky. Lucky is an Australian cattle dog/boarder terrier mix. About 30lbs of love and cuteness and energy. He's 18 months old and has a ""hard mouth"" that destroys stuffed toys in under 2 minutes and shreads most tough toys. This ball showed fun and promise and I thought he'd have a few days of fun with it, the description mentioned being natural rubber and tough, so i thought it might bounce or be good for interaction. Nope. Didn't bounce, Lucky liked it but he just ran off with it and ate 1/4 of it in under 4 minutes flat! Now, since he's not actually bouncing, I guess he'll be ok but I certainly couldn't recommend this toy."
2,Destroyed in minutes,It was cool while it lasted. Threw some dog biscuits in it for the first time and within 15 minutes my pit had ripped this thing apart.
1,Not very durable,"My one year old lab LOVED this toy for the first half hour, before she started ripping chunks off of it and i had to take it away. She did protest when i took it from her."
1,What a waste,My 30 lb dog had this in 5 pieces in less than a minute. I didn't even get the tag off and he already had it torn up. Not for chewers!
3,Dog toy,"The product is just fine,but it's not my dogs kind of toy.My fault as I was trying something new.I'll just keep trying too.So keep the sales happeneing.TYJeff Dann"
2,doesn't last,"My 40 lb doodle had this torn apart in approx 64 seconds after he first laid eyes on it. He loved it a little too much and now it's in the garbage... If your dog is any kind of a chewer, pass on this one. It's too expensive to last only a minute."
1,Isn't nearly as sturdy as the picture,"Took about 30 seconds for my dog to tear apart. Took it out of the box and gave it to him. Walked up the stairs to find half of it hanging from his mouth and the other half on the stairs. The rubber is very thin and pliable. I thought I was getting a ball that was hardened rubber. Not the case.One note, the description says that it's great for stuffing treats into it. While that maybe the case, the dog will tear apart the toy getting to it. Also, it better be a big treat as the holes are big."
1,Not durable at all,My 1 year old lab mix ripped this apart in less than an hour. Waste of money for us. :(
1,Not tough enough!,"I bought this for a family member's dog that likes to chew, and he destroyed it in a matter of minutes. I had hoped this one would hold up."
5,"Great, durable toy!","My Australian Shepherd mix rips apart ALL toys, but this one. We call it ""treat ball"" at our house because we can stuff doggie jerkey strips in it and he is completely engaged and entertained rolling it around and digging the strips out!"
2,Strange quality,"This ball turned weird and cakey texture. It left pink rubber all over the place, and then after I washed it, it was chalky and discolored. The smell is weird too. My dogs never played with it."
5,Holee roller,This is my babies favorite toy. Sometimes there are 4 of them on it at one time. My girl Heidi brings it to me to kick for her and she jumps up and grabs it in air. She has gone thru 5 balls now over 2 years.
5,Surprisingly durable,"My small dog is a ""power chewer"" (uses black Kongs in the next size up, decimates rawhide and Nylabone, etc.) but hasn't put a dent in this toy. Maybe she just hasn't put her mind to it, but she just likes to hold it while opening and closing her mouth. I guess she just likes the ""springy-ness"" of it. My only complaint is we put this outside and the sun has made the plastic more brittle and crumbly but I won't hesitate to replace it with another just like it."
3,Lasted 3 minutes,"I read many reviews to try to get a feel for what size dog this toy would be appropriate for, and in the end it seemed right for my 25 pound Border Terrier mix. Right out of the package he was wagging his tail in anticipation. I did the typical get him excited thing and then rolled it off for him to go after. He liked it. He began chewing on it. 3 minutes later he had torn several pieces of it off.I took a quick picture before it was destroyed so others can see the size of my dog in relation to the toy and get an accurate assessment of whether it will be right for their dog or not (see submitted photograph).It's a cheap toy, but I expected more than 3 minutes out of the thing. If your dog is a weak chewer, it might just be perfect; if s/he's even a medium chewer, it might not last past breakfast."
5,favorite fetch ball,"This is my dog's favorite ball to fetch. She's able to catch the hollee roller in her mouth and carry it around. We like the 3.5 inch for in the house and we use a 6.5 inch for outside, it's great for kicking. It took two years of chewing and gnawing to chew through her holee roller so we replaced it at that time."
3,Easy Chew,My mediun size YorkeyPoo had this ball for three days and had it torn apart. She loves the toy but too easly ruined. I would not recommend.
5,Great toy that is pretty indestructible for smaller dogs,My pup loves fetching and chewing this toy. It's awesome too because it is flexible and can easily be tossed around the house without worries of hurting anything
1,Dog broke it within 20 minutes,"My parents dog is a heavy chewer and used a similar brand. I wanted to try this one as the other one was not available, but definitely a knock off since my friends dog is smaller and less of a chewer yet managed to destroy this toy (not along the seems) in 20 minutes... wasn't even tugging this one..."
5,Hours of fun,"I stick a tennis ball or a chuck it ball in the center, which my dog is unable to get out. She'll bat it around and try to get the ball out. It keeps her occupied for long periods of time. Plus, these are very durable."
2,I should have known better,"I have a 1 year old dachshund/lab/shepherd (only know the weenie for sure) pup that loves to chew on toys that have a little give. For instance, he's not a huge fan of the Nylabones durachews cause they're so tough; I think he likes to feel like he's getting something out of chewing. He kind of likes Kongs, but not that much, unless they have peanut butter in them.A lot of people wrote about how durable this thing was, but in my experience, it's not at all. After about 10 minutes with it, he'd already chewed through a piece of it, so I took it away from him. The only thing that was going to happen after that was that he would start tearing off pieces and chewing on them, just like he's done before to other toys. Guess I'll just keep looking out for a durable rubber toy that he'll actually chew on."
5,Great for Fetch,Louis loves this toy for fetch! We can even use it in the house as it rolls very well and is really light.
2,Disappointed,"I loved this toy and thought it would be great, but the pit bull/lab mix killed it within 10 minutes. Nothing left of it. Can't someone make a toy that will survive a strong puppy?"
5,Puppy LOVES this,"What a fun ball! Purchased for 8 week old puppy. We've been using this for 3 weeks now. Soft on his mouth, easy to pick up with his mouth, and it rolls so well! We play fetch/drop it with the Hol-ee Roller every day. Great for outside or inside. Very glad I picked this up for him. One of his favorite games."
2,"five inch ball held up better than the 6.5"" ball","One of my dogs (a whopping 20lbs) ripped apart the 6 1/2 inch ball in two places in under ten minutes.The same dog took about a month to destroy the 5 inch ball and this was after a lot of ""tug of war"" and abuse.The bigger ball did not seem to be defective and it never even got any ""tug of war"" time before it was ripped! The dog was entertaining himself with it--very light use."
5,tough toy,I have two 5 yr. old labs and now my daughter's puppy they all love this toy. I didn't think it would last long. This new one is for the puppy for Christmas.
5,Perfect size and lots of fun for our pup!,"We have a 4-month-old Lhasa and she enjoys almost all of her toys but really likes the Hol-ee-Roller because it is large enough not to roll under furniture and light enough that she can pick it up when she gets tired of chasing it. Our pup is a chewer but so far just plays with her toys instead of trying to demolish them. The 5-inch apple green works for us and more importantly, is a great addition to our pup's toy collection."
3,Not for big chewers,"I have an 80 pound german shepherd who loves to chew. I read some of the reviews thinking the thick rubber might last him a bit. I was wrong!! He loves the toy, but he chews off small pieces of rubber. I have to watch him while he chews to make sure he doesn't swallow any of it. It would make a great toy for a doy that doesn't chew as much. Makes a great tug-a-war toy."
1,not durable,"my dog tore it up within the first hour of play... maybe the thicker versions are more durable, but this one doesn't seem suited for chewing at all (notwithstanding the marketing)"
1,not for dogs who like to chew,my dog had this for less then a min. and it was in a thousand pieces all over the floor... however when i called the customer service line i was very well taken care of!
5,Great to put treats inside - durable and fun!,"Our dog is a power chewer. She's medium sized with big dog chewpower!She loves this ball - we have the blue one. It is perfect for making her really work to get to her Stella and Chewy's freeze dried steaks. We break them in half, stretch open one of the openings and put the treats inside. She has a ball rolling, chasing and bouncing this thing around. Keeps her interested and active for about 15 minutes as she figures a way to get to the treats inside. She loves a good puzzle!While she does stand on this collapsible ball, and chews on it, she has not damaged it- and that's a relief, since she IS a power chewer."
2,3 Discs Feature the Same Episode,"Like the other reviewer stated, this series explains the history of the carrier during the war in the Pacific using World War II stock footage that is fantastic but placed all in the wrong places. That can get very irritating....Second, this is a three disc set but all three discs are the same episode with the same stock footage. They vary only in different narrators and the addition of very poor computer graphics in trying to explain certain battles. The re-creation of the attack on Pearl Harbor was laughable. The graphics and geography were terrible.I would avoid wasting money on this series. There are much better documentaries out there regarding the aircraft carrier in World War II."
3,Informative,The information provided is detailed but aimed at the history of World War II. Not much detail on the actual ships themselves. For that I had to get a different video.
3,"Generally accurate, but with horrible film editing","I generally enjoyed the information in the videos, but cringed at the editing of the accompanying films. They showed the wrong aircraft, the wrong targets, misidentified aircraft and ships, and even had the wrong sound effects. They actually have quite a bit of the right footage, but for some reason decided to pad it with absolutely horribly inaccurate additional film. Then they showed the exact same films during which they described different battles. It really ruins what could have been an interesting and informative series."
4,Macally good choice,"The USB Optical Internet Mouse is as advertised, and a good choice for Mac users who aren't ready for a wireless mouse. Good value; lightweight and is not too big."
2,Doesn't work on Intel Macs - go to Logitech,"while I like the feel of this mouse, there is no excuse for the useless drivers and lack of clarification or support about its supposed programmability.I am not going to waste time trying to figure out whether this device will ever work. When I try to set preferences , options are not available on my Intel MacBkPro running 10.4.11 -- the ""continue"" button is greyed out. I think this just doesn't work on Intel Macs but MacAlly won't say that definitively. I confirm the others who say they can't get the software to work.Buy a Logitech, they work better, they support better and the program like a dream."
2,I returned this mouse.,"I was very disappointed with this macally mouse. I had one before, but this one was very cheap feeling, the clicking and scrolling was loud, and the red light was quite annoying. I returned it for a microsoft wireless mouse which i love! (im on a macbook)"
4,Solid,"This mouse is rock solid. Tough, you'll have to deal with a plain white surface, but it stays clean (it did for me after 2-3 years of using it before it finally broke). Bonus points for super fast tracking speed (can be turned right back down if desired). BTW: It's $10 if you look around."
5,Great!,"Really nice product--so easy to click and scroll. Works great with my iMac. In fact, I find it easier to use than the original mouse that came with the computer (I think they call that one the Mighty Mouse) because the MacAlly IceMouse doesn't have the tiny scroll ball. I did like the tiny scroll ball of the Mighty Mouse when I first got my computer, but, after I used it for awhile, I found that it would fail to operate unless I turned the mouse upside down and rolled it furiously, back and forth, to get it going again. Finally, it just failed to work altogether. The larger, more traditional scroll wheel on this MacAlly Ice Mouse, although not as innovative as the tiny scroll wheel, seems like it will be more durable and reliable over the course of time than was the tiny ball of the Mighty Mouse. The white color is attractive and fits in with the color and design of my Mac.Highly recommended!"
2,"Mediocre Mouse, Lousy for Mac","The mouse works adequately but only barely. It is not accurate, when I click one line of text, it often rolls to another and selects that instead.The software that came with is useless for Macintosh, and this mouse will not wake a sleeping Mac.It is comfortable in my small hand. Unlike most Mac mice, it has right and left buttons that work as expected.The scroll button is extremely grating, rough and difficult to roll. And then only rolls vertically.For $21, it's only about 50% overpriced. I needed a mouse in a hurry after I poured milk all over my last one, a Kinsington they don't make anymore, and when I took that one apart to dry it out, small parts jumped out and escaped into the trash on my floor, and this one arrived two days later. Hooray Amazon. Boo Macally.Apple's Mickey Mouse -- er Mighty Mouse -- is better, but way overpriced. This will do till I find something better."
4,Macally iceMouse USB Optical Internet Mouse,"Works great. Being a new PC to Mac convert, I did not like the feel of the mouse that came with my Mac. I had to have the 2 button scroll. This mouse works great, and is a heck of a lot cheaper than the Mac brand."
1,Very Dissapointed,A cheap mouse that both looks quickly made and has poor functionality. It is difficult to achieve basic responses and also has a long ugly cord dangling between it and the USB portal. I somehow thought it was wireless USB. So maybe I'm the idiot. I am sorry that I ordered this.
5,A COUPLE OF YEARS NOW,"I have had this mouse for a couple of years now. In that time I have tried to go wireless several times. But every time after spending quite a bit on batteries, the wireless mice always seem to break down and I am back to this mouse. I am using it with a Macbook Pro and its small size makes the mouse very portable for travel. Unlike some reviewers I have had zero problems and I have not been gentle with it as my kids use it as well. It does everything a mouse is meant to do in a comfortable ergonomic and small size. Highly recommended!"
3,"Scroll wheel doesn't work outside, poor (outsourced) tech support","Since I intended to use my mouse also outside with nice weather, before buying this, I asked Macally customer support if this mouse would also work outside. They promised it would, as long as I kept it in the shadow. But they were wrong: it doesn't, not even in the shadow; it's not the optical tracking that stops working as you's expect, but strangely enough it's the SCROLL WHEEL that simply doesn't work outside!Furthermore, I encountered installation problems, and Macally's outsourced support wasn't able to help me out, due to a total lack of knowledge about the product!"
4,great mouse for the price,The Macally icemouse optical mouse works up to expectations. The scroll feature is a little rough compared to many others but it's a nice option to have for the Mac. The right click option is terrific... and It's a bargin.
2,Not impressed.,"It's not bad for a cheap mouse, which was what I was after. But, it had a really bright red light under it, and the scroll wheel clicks really loudly. It feels cheap and performs the same. Oh well--"
1,STOPPED WORKING AFTER 2 MONTHS,"After owning this mouse for about 2 months, it stopped working for no good reason. I took good care of it too; I had it on my desk, never spilled anything on it or got it dirty, and then it just stopped working only 2 months after buying it brand new from Amazon! Big waste of money!"
3,"Nice looking, simple mouse but not fully compatible","Nice looking mouse, wheel moves well, slim design, but I couldn't get the software to work properly on my G4 933 running OSX 10.3.9. System refused to recognize the mouse so I couldn't set any of the preferences. Emailed Macally support and they sent me what they called the correct and most up to date driver, but same problem. Had to return the mouse to Amazon for a refund. Replaced with a Logitech MX1000 Laser. Just installed the software it works! I'm just trying it out and will post a review soon. I've justed several Logitech mice and have never been disappointed."
2,Look at the charts and graphs,"I could not finish reading this book, because I got too involved in studying all the charts and graphs. They tell us (assuming the data is accurate) that we are a little bit diffrent but so is every other nation -- but America is the only super power and that will not make you super popular."
2,Only if you hate conservatives...,"This is an excellent book for any Bush-bashing club or anti-neocon socialites. The book is based almost entirely on faulty data from polls. Many of the questions in the polls (available on-line) ask respondents to judge things they can't possibly know, and the polls are given the weight of authority. Having traveled on 5 continents in the past 10 years, I can tell you that the world only hates America in one place: in the media! Everywhere else, people basically don't even care. Some absolutely adore America, a few hate us. All you have to do is look at how many people are trying to get into the country, buying American products and emulating any part of American culture to know that there really is no such thing as anti-Americanism. Okay, maybe some international terrorists hate us, too, but I think we all know why!"
4,I liked this cd,"I liked this cd, provided me with a few hours of entertainment. Its definately one album they you may have a mid night craving to hear on a lonesome night. Oh and ya the comment of the exploited... get a life kid exploiteds first album was in 1981 ""punks not dead"" and I highly doubt the exploited is to blame for what punk is nowdays"
2,Pure what?,"The Casualties. The Virus. A Global Threat. The new punk? Give me a break, this is more metal than it is punk. Street punk? Hardcore punk? THAT ISN'T PUNK! I'm not even going to bother redirecting these misguided fans. The only reason I gave this two stars was because they aren't quite as horrible as The Casualties, and the like. Punk is dead. Hardcore isn't, but punk is, face it. All you need to form a band like this is the ability to take a piss on a guitar and catch a cold, so you can lose your voice. Avoid this while you can."
2,oi?,"first of let me say this is no where near oi!. it is true that oi is a form of street-punk but come on metal-punk cant be called oi.christ you ""punks"" dont know what oi! is. what a shamemusically it is ok. nothing great. some good guitar work though but the vocals get annoying after a while."
4,fun birthday gift,The dog was great and birthday girl loves it but the pen was broken right when we took it out of the package.
4,Great Gift;,"Bought this for my granddaughter when she had her tonsils removed. ""Pinky"" wore a mask and IV! Was a hit for doctor and nurses who signed every inch of her!! Removed anticipation. As others mentioned--pen didn't work. We used a fine point sharpie.Good size/Good quality."
5,"Anyone who teaches, needs to read this book","This is an outstanding little book, full of useful information and great ideas for formulating lessons and practical demonstrations. Anyone who teaches - including those who teach adults NEEDS this book!"
2,All mixed up,"The stories themselves are great, however, the discs are all marked wrong. For example, I put in the first disc marked ""A Time to Kill"" and it was ""The Client"" instead. I had to use a marker and rename all 11 discs!"
1,GRRREEAAATTTTT!!!!!!!!!,"The book's setting is in a small town in Mississippi. Tonya, one day, went for a walk to the town market to fetch some things for her mother. On her way home, two men pick her up. They take her to the woods and rape her. When they're done the leave her on a bridge, beat up and ready to die. She is later returned to her family by a group of black fishermen. Tonya's father, Carl Lee, decides he needs to get revenge for his daughter. So when they are in court about this whole thing, Carl Lee catches the men in a stairwell ant the courthouse and blows them away with an M-16. The fight now is if Carl Lee is guilty or not. He has to face an all white court (whom are prejudice) and plead not guilty. We'll see what happens"
2,Hamilton dog collar .,Hamlton dog collar nice collar except plastic snap broke after a month of use.Would not buy product again tried contacting company 3 times will not reply.
5,"The best, but overpriced",This is the best anthology of contemporary poetry now available. But the publisher insists on overcharging for it.
5,Scotch is Always top Notch!!,This tape is just as described and will do the job for heavy duty taping. Buy them in singles or in bulk at great prices here and with prime membership the prices can't be beat.
4,"glossy, interesting","Overall, a great book that educates the reader in an entertaining, clear and down-to-earth manner. I especially appreciated the background information (for example, on slavery, segregation and the cotton trade) which puts the blues into its social and spiritual context. This book is clearly a labour of love, especially for Bill Wyman, but that love unfortunately extends to an excessive number of Bill Wyman photographs. Bear in mind that as a coffeee table book, this book lacks some of the depth and flow of a good blues read, evident in books such as Robert Palmer's ""Deep Blues"" or Alan Lomax's ""The land where the blues began""."
3,Not quite up to the hype,This is a pretty good book if you want to learn the basics of where blues came from and if you like Wyman/the Stones because it's billed as a pretty personal reflection. It's not a travel guide to where blues came from like The Blues Highway: New Orleans to Chicago which explores a similar theme but it's useful background reading.
5,Roots of the Blues and African American History,"Sure this book is like an encyclopedia, but you won't find a better guide for finding obscure blues artists that otherwise would be forgotten. Most books go into familiar territory and rehash the same old information, but Bill Wyman is a serious collector who wants to share his love of the blues. This book is loaded with enough information to get you started on your own eclectic blues collection."
5,mystery movie,Boris Karloff was great in these movies. I never did like the horror movies that he was in but these I really like. He did a exceptional job as Mr Wong. Well worth the little price that was paid. The picture and sound was very good.
2,"Quality stinks . . . not ""exactly"" what it indicates","I believed from the picture and description that this was all Boris Karloff and it isn't. The quality of the video transfer is poor and sound is often unintelligible. Bought two others in the ""Mystery"" series, but no more. Save your money at any price for these."
3,Not so bad,"It hard to believe Boris being a detective you normally is him in master movies, but the movie was very good. The writing good and compiling"
5,This is the author's best book!,"And I happen to know this book is the ""favorite child"" of this much-published author. I read it with just as much, if not more pleasure than Anguished English and Get Thee to a Punnery, some of Richard's more famous works. Don't expect the usual mad romp through the English language; this book is more literary than light literature.If you want to improve your writing, you will profit by reading the chapter on the beauty of using short words. The examples of student writings that employ only single syllable words are dazzling.If you teach English, you might enjoy using some of the student writing examples in your classes to inspire your own students. In fact if you are an English teacher or just a lover of the English language, I don't see how you can be without this book. It is a treasure."
3,"Is ""language"" the same thing as ""English""","The title of this book says the ""MIRACLE OF LANGUAGE"", yet there is little discussion of the origins, the psychology, the evolutionary aspects of language. Instead it is a sometimes witty treatise on English in all its glory. If he wanted to write such a book it should have been called ""THE FUN OF ENGLISH"" or something to that effect.The text is HUGE and spread out - a lot like those self-help books that one can zip through in about half an hour. Some of the topics were interesting but by and large this was a tale of modern English."
4,Great under rated band,"Great collection from this band that mostly flew under the radar. Includes their best song and single ""Exchange"" along with all their other early singles. Highly Recommended"
5,Honesty,"They were kind enough, to give me a complete refund and not send me completely damaged goods."
4,does as advertised,i bought this for my brother for christmas (he is not black like in the picture but he still enjoys it as much as the pictured black man)
3,Difficult to turn on.,"The design of this flashlight is poor compared to other Pelican flashlights. In order to turn this light on one must twist the head of the flashlight. Unlike the octagonal head on the Pelican Sabrelite with the twist turn-on, the head on this flashlight is round and smooth, making it difficult to turn on. Also, for some reason the head on this flashlight is extremely tight making it even more difficult to twist. On the positive side, if you're looking for a compact flashlight with great light output, this is it."
5,Do Yourself a Favor,"I agree with some of the above reviews, disagree with others. The ones I read were interesting and brought back pleasant memories of time I spent reading this book. Something I can add is the following emphatic: Do Not Die Without Reading This Book."
4,What's to say?,What's to say? These are standard vitamins. Product arrived on time and was as expected. So far it continues to perform. Price was right as well. I would purchase again from this organization.
4,Half An Ear,"I brought this CD home from a local library's CD collection on pure speculation. I had never heard of these guys. Listening first with my hands in the kitchen sink, every song caught my attention and I am happy to report I had to wash the dishes again because this album wasn't made for multi-tasking.Each song stands out, unique and individual. It's an album full of country blues ""hits"" that can each stand on it's own. That's awesome stuff, in this or any era of recorded music. Fans of Americana, country, blues, singer-songwriter buy this. Money well spent. Highly recommended."
2,Not a shining moment for Kane....,"An average album that, normally, would merit your average typical run-of-the-mill review and - perhaps, at a stretch - three stars. Nothing memorable to say about this album at all or any individual track except one.The song, ""I Can't Wait"", credited to Kane, is a straight copy/take of the famous song ""Bright Blue Rose"" by Ireland's revered singer-songwriter, Jimmy MacCarthy. Deduct one star for this stupidity. Time to get back to the drawing board, Mr Kane."
5,THE magazine for 5-stringers,I really don't have much to say except that if you love playing the 5-string banjo then you will find something of interest and amusement in every issue of BNL. It is a real bargain and clearly a labor of love of its editors and writers.
3,Nothin' Special,"Its ok, but nothin' special. For the money, I would have expected a something a little classier. Kinda looks like a high-school news paper. No product reviews, and very little in the way of instruction. Probably won't renew."
5,Best banjo publication in the world!,"If it is about banjo--Banjo Newsletter has it. Bluegrass, old time, classical, jazz, minstel, gourd--all styles are featured in this magazine. Interviews of artists, builders, historians. Information on festivals, camps, and classified ads. My copies are always on time and this last year--there are now color photos instead of just black and white. The monthly print newsletter is supported by an online page of MP3s of the tablatures in the newsletter.BNL has an international following and I have made many friends from this contact.BNL is both a joy and a bargain.Vintage BanjoWalkin' That Banjo HomeBanjo Dreamin' Suwannee NightsA Secret Life Of Banjo"
1,Did Not Last Very Long,"I bought this item for attending my grandson's baseball/football/swim meet games. I have used it approximately 4 times and the last time I used it the SEAT RIPPED away from the aluminum bar to which it was attached. I do not weigh anywhere near 250 pounds. I am totally disappointed in this as the chair part was very uncomfortable to sit in for a very long period of time, and the fact that it tore so easily. At that price it should have lasted for YEARS. I am very very disappointed. I am usually very happy with my purchases from Amazon, but this one is not something I would ever consider buying again."
5,Just what I needed,"I am a senior citizen taking an exercise class.. At the facility we use, there was no place to sit when changing clothes so this just fit a need. Not only is it useful for transporting clothes and exercise equipment, it gives a place to sit to put on shoes, etc. I had an idea of what I needed, and was pleased when appeared in my search."
2,Wish I could rate this higher,This has a wonderful collection of quick to stitch items that would really come in handy at gift giving time. However there is a huge glaring error in this book which prevents me from reccomending it. There is a chart for a Jewish Star done in flowers in the book. One of the flowers looks exactly like a cross so you have a Jewish star filled with crosses. As a Jewish person I found this upsetting and a little offensive. I was surprised the designer and the editors let this go.
3,Not as cute as I thought,"This little kitty is ok... I thought the face would be cuter. She is really soft though and cuddly. She is pretty small, like Beanie Baby size."
4,Entwistle shines,"If you are a fan of Entwistle's songs for The Who or his bass playing, you will enjoy this collection. I was unfamiliar with his solo work before listening to this album. After listening to the album, it seems a good place to start investigating him. Someone not looking to dig too deep into his solo work, but wanting a taste will also enjoy it. Some Who songs are on here (Heaven and hell, Whiskey man, Boris the Spider.....)and songs that I had never heard before but now love (Try me...). Having some live material makes the collection all the more enticing. I definitely suggest that anyone wondering about Entwistle who-less pick this up. If you're already a fan of John solo, I would check to see how much of this material you already have, but the live versions are still a lure.I give it 4 stars when comparing it to his work with The Who. It is very good, but his best moments are still with the band we've come to know him in."
1,false advertising...wrong picture!,This item is not as pictured. It is not an audio cd-rw but a common data cd-rw and will not work in a standalone recorder that requires an audio/music cd-rw.
2,Where are the Step by Steps?,"This is another book that offers ""step by steps"" but doesn't fulfill the promise. I'm just starting out in acrylics and have bought several books to try to get me pointed in the right way. I am looking for something that is more step by step informative and this definitely is not the one. I'm starting to think there are no books for beginning acrylic painters."
4,Baby steps,Good starter book about acrylic painting. I downloaded to my kindle fire and it is very handy to refer to.
5,Fun and Funny for All,"A fun read for kids grades 4, 5, 6, 7 & even older. The humor is just right for these kids. Read it and see. Maybe you, too, could try making your sibbling ""snarf"" or get an adult to wipe his/her chin repeatedly. As a teacher, I highly recommend this book for reluctant readers. They will read energetically and excitedly. My 7th grade students want more Riot Brothers. Enjoy!"
3,You will need much more than this book,"Despite the glowing editorial reviews of this book, I found it to be a mixed bag. It is very brief (just 120 pages total) so it is hardly a comprehensive guide for the new Real Estate agent. The author does include a handful of good points that are worth noting. However, some suggestions are personal to her and questionable, like holding food drives or handing out balloons by the pool to gain new business.For me, the few good points were perhaps enough to justify the low (used) purchase price, but a reader should not believe that this book will equip them with the tools to be a successful Real Estate agent. Think of it as a bulleted list of good tips and a quick overview of the business - nothing more. You will need a great deal more reading material, training, and experience to be successful."
3,its crazy out here,I am a beginner and have not even taken my first lesson yet but I can honestly say this keyboard is pretty and looks good when I walk around with it.
4,Not bad for beginners...,"Yeap, that's all I could say.. it's great for all beginners who never lay their hands on the keyboard, because it has some features that some other don't have, which is songbook controller, that could let you play, PAUSE, forward, backward, while other only can do play and stop.. which is uneffective to learning from the image of keyboard button on the lcd. It is really helpful.. that's why I cancel to buy LK-43 and buy this instead(even though they have the lighting keys-I think it's not really helping, though..)"
3,You get what you pay for,"As a fairly cheap way to buy the first four seasons of Hell's Kitchen, this gets the job done. You get the same 13 discs released separately for roughly (as of this writing) $20 off. However, if you're buying this for the packaging or the pack-ins, I wouldn't recommend it. The tin the discs come in looks fairly cheaply made, and I can't imagine ever using the recipe booklet or apron. The discs themselves come in two completely un-labeled multi-disc cases, seasons one and two in one case, and seasons three and four in the other. This looks like a well-made bootleg. (It isn't, it's just not super-attractive.) I think the four separate seasons would have looked better on my shelf than the tin. If these are sacrifices you're willing to make to save $20, then, as you're getting the same content, by all means, go for it. But if you're picky about how your DVDs look (like I usually am,) or if you already have one or more of the seasons, this isn't worth your money."
5,Fun and Entertaining,"I really enjoyed watching Hell's Kitchen seasons 1-4. The DVDs come in a tin container with clear DVD cases which look kind of cheap, and you get a cheap apron and cookbook, but the whole point of this review is about the show. The episodes are unedited so you can get a better understanding of what was really being said throughout the show (unlike TV where all you hear is BEEP). I found the show suspenseful and funny. The contestants are very entering as well. In all if you like reality game shows you will love Hell's Kitchen."
4,A gift for a foodie,"Not so much for the technique as the entertainment. I purchased this as a gift, and the recipient was delighted."
1,Not what I ordered,I would not recommend this product. It is not what I ordered. What I got shipped was Stutz 10000 in a black bottle and its like a aerosol spray. It has a bad/ perfume like smell to it and does not numb..I tested on my hand. I WILL NOT BE SPRAYING THIS ANYWHERE! lol!
4,JOHN DIGWEED NEVER STOPS,"In this album, digweed brings more of a trance sound than his usual deep house flavor. I especially like the track ""Easy"" which has some raw energy of many digweed tracks I've grown to love. Definitely an album worth buying."
3,"Not what I expected,but still good","Just got this cd today. It's not too bad but I was expecting something better. It started way too deep and stayed that way. I've been a big fan Digweed for quite a while but to be honest,his global underground serious are way better than this. This doesn't mean I had given up on the guy buy I am gonna go for the second volume of the transitions. Electronic music is changing 24/7 and it's kinda hard the catch up but once I listen the second version, I'll make an another review."
1,bullydog seems to have blown out my engine computer,"Pulled battery cables (neg) and removed fender well , I did this even if bully dog's instructions don't mention this procedure as it is a pain in the backside. Removed computer, removed casing screws then used scotch pad to expose connections on board, installed bully dog chip then put it back together then turned key to the glow plug position position and nothing not even a flash. I then pulled the computer out and removed bully dog chip. NOW MY TRUCK WILL NOT START AT ALL. I GOT SCREWED . I then happened to meet a diesel mechanic who told me he recently removed bully dog chips from an entire fleet of diesel moving trucks because of the problems they create. WHO'S PAYING FOR THE COST OF A NEW COMPUTER ?."
5,Hilarious!!,"Why hasn't anyone picked up the movie rights?? This is a gem of a book, I'm on my second copy because the first got passed around so much I lost track of the web of borrowers. Anyone who loves shopping, eating, or just a good belly laugh, must read this book. My favourite moment is the aunt who tells the poor little rich girl ""Whaddya mean, you don't need any shoes? You got feet- you need shoes!"" My thoughts exactly... buy the shoes, buy the book, and copies for your mother, your friends - everyone!"
5,"Not cheap, but definitely a bargain","I had to buy this book in Germany from Amazon.de so I could expand my travel plan after an unexpected longer stay (brought two of Steve's other books there). The price I paid was more than 50% higher than the States.But boy, what a bargain!! It saved my time, energy, and money. Use it as a tool, not a book!!"
1,Waste of my evening!,"What???? Sorry, but this movie had NO acting merit whatsoever to me. Maybe it's because I like movies with a little more substance. I saw it on tv and was glad I did not purchase it. It just did not flow at all. The characters were not believable in my opinion."
3,Funny!!,I am a Sandra Oh fan so I bought this movie because of her and Taye Diggs.It was fun to watch and I enjoyed it.
3,Tea: Cute and fun flavor,"Overall a cute and fun romantic comedy movie. Not a movie i'd recommend if you're expecting deep intellectual messages and life change.The story follows a young free spirit woman, who takes over, as Editor, a wedding magazine for her father who has fallen ill. Oh, right, and she doesn't believe in marriage or weddings! So she has to undergo some internal digging, with herself and a touch of soul scrubbing to heal her own issues and stand up to her Dad as well, who is a bit of a tyrant. She ends up falling into interest with her father's V.P. who is there to help guide through.Good acting, decent story, loved her BFF, cute love story. Nothing Oscar winning here, to be sure. But a good movie to watch on a lazy day, with your chick vibe friends, maybe a brunch pajama tea party with scones!I would purchase this for my collection."
3,"typical Heather Graham role, not as good as the others","This movie has a typical Heather Graham character: cute, with a few shots with skimpy clothes - but not really erotic.It is a romantic comedy, certainly not a thriller of any kind.For me, it did not have as much 'soul' as that of similar Heather movies."
5,AWESOME BRACELET - MY WIFE WILL BE SO HAPPY!,The setting and the stones are awesome - the quality really shows! I just know she will totally love this!
5,I love Hot Tools!,"I just love this flat iron! I have REALLY long hair and I opted for this one rather than the three-inch-wide iron. The three-inch-wide iron is really too big and hard to use. I have straight hair naturally, but it has a slight wave to it. This iron is great for that shiny, stick-straight look.It is really light, easy to use and great for travel! Hot Tools is always a great brand. It's the only brand I use now. I prefer the ceramic tourmaline tools, but they do not have one in the flat iron arena. This regular ceramic is still good though. I can definitely tell the next day that my hair feels less dry then it normally does when I use a non-ceramic iron.If you can choose the seller, pick DiscountJungle. Their prices are almost always cheaper...but beware, shipping is about $10. However, the item always arrives quickly. I've used DiscountJungle twice now. Both times the items arrived two days after I placed the order."
1,Very Disappointed,After I purchased my 1189 Hot tools flat iron it exploded on me while in use. Please be aware that this model is not very reliable. I prefer the 1177 model instead. i have had better luck with that one.
2,Would not purchase again,This iron only lasted me 10 months before I had to throw it out. One day it just would not heat up. It does not heat up as well as another brand I have tried before. I have medium-thick straight hair with a slight wave at the ends. My hair is one length about 6 inches below the shoulder. The next flat iron I buy will be one with a higher voltage of at least 200. This Hot Tools one is only 170 watts and is not hot enough to get the job done the first time. I usually have to go over the same spot twice.
5,Eisley's parents,I think Eisley sound like these guys. Not the other way around. These kids were out way before Eisley since this disc came out in `99 and Eisley didn't start playing shows until `01. It makes me laugh how Calamine did the Sealab theme song. Great stuff. Great disc.
5,CALAMINE,"Easily the greatest EP of all time. Julie and Dan are the best vocal combo I've ever heard...it's a shame this is the only documented music they made together, because it scorches anything else made before or since.Buy it! It must be experienced from start to finish to be truly appreciated."
3,History revisited,"While I learned quite a few new things I found many of the reproduced documents with the early history they did not add much. That Americans treated the Puerto Ricans like they treated the native Americans, Aleutians and blacks is not also not a surprise they took what the wanted and left the chaff. The book could have been more expansive in its coverage of the efforts of the indigenous people to gain their freedom. Still looking for more about the migrations from the island to Hawaii and the rest of the world."
5,Fit for my canon 50mm 1.8,I ordered this for my canon 50mm f1.8 ...it fits the lens without issue. I can now use a 72mm ND filter on my 50mm f1.8 that has a filter size of 52mm
4,A refreshing guide to strategy in third world economies,"This book is a surprise. Very fun to read, very insightful and plenty of new ideas for doing business from emerging economies."
4,"Pleased, but not enthralled","My 2 yr old son got this car from a friend who grew out of it, and he spends a lot of time in it doing things like running over his little brother, stashing his tools in the trunk, and filling up on gas. He likes it of course, but I don't really think it's worth what our friends paid for it. MAYbe if it came with the gas pump, but to a frugal shopper like me, you could could get more for your money buying something else. For that amount you could get a little motorized ride on like the fire engine that amazon has. Overall, I'm not complaining, execpt the horn doesn't work like another reviewer said...But I wouldn't personally buy it, not unless it was priced like the other model for 40 bucks, another note - it is huge, so make sure you have the room for it, it doesn't fold up like half of the kid contraptions we all own. hope this helps :)"
5,"Great for Younger Crowd, Too!","My 12 month old loves his Grand Coupe. We were disappointed that the steering wheel does not turn the wheels (the reason we bought this instead of the Cozy Coupe II), but my son ADORES his car.He's not big enough to propell the car Flintstone style well yet, but he loves climbing in and out of the car, opening and closing the door, turning the steering wheel, playing with the gas cap, and us pushing him around in the car.The car seems very sturdy, and I am sure he will enjoy it for years to come."
3,Not meant for lots of kids or kids over 30lbs.,"I teach pre-k as well as a child care program durring the summer. I have gone through two of these cars in the past year. The biggest problem is the wheels go up into the plastic and it becomes wobbly then eventualy no longer moves. I had the older red one years ago and it lasted much longer. My suggestion if you have one is do not let a child more than 30-35 lbs. ride in it and do not let kids lean on the top of the car, both of these things help attribute to the ""tearing"" in the plastic."
3,Not That Great,"I am underwhelmed, the steering wheel does not control the wheels and there is no place for the child to rest his\her feet while being pushed"
5,Nice collection of poetry,"I really enjoyed this collection of poems, which ranged from the familiar to the unfamiliar, both in terms of poems and in poets. Some poems I'd read before, and I was aware of a few lines from others in this thin book, but others were new to me, and I enjoyed being introduced to some ones I hadn't read before. The price on this book makes it a great value!"
3,Songs for the Open Road,Enjoyed this book because it speaks to the traveler and gypsy that dwells in us all. It was an easy read.
4,Wonderful,"I ordered this book as a Christmas gift, and it arrived in a timely manor just as described. The book was in mint condition, and he loved it. There are a wide variety of poets, subjects and styles that all fit into an adventurous category."
4,Worth it,If you are on this page that means you have some interest in poetry. You are an idiot if you do not throw down the $1.50 to buy this book (especially if you have prime). Just do it.I have discovered some very inspirational poems in this short collection.
2,What You See Is Not What You Get,"Although this is one tough-looking mat, what is shown in the photo with the product listing is not what is delivered. We wanted a cargo liner that would cover the entire area from the back of the second row of seats to the hatch door in our 2010 Ford Expedition. What is shown in the product photo is that; however, when we opened the box upon delivery, it acutally is a mat that only covers from the back of the third row of seats to the hatch door. It was very disappointing, and we had to return the product since it was not what was shown."
1,Junk! If I could give minus stars I would give -5,"As a former Marine and Army firearms trainer and technician this video is absolute junk. It is ""dog and pony show"" used to entertain the unsuspecting. Do not buy it. If you know nothing about marksmanship and/or long distance shooting you could do better in your sleep.I purchased my copy from Paladin Press and was disappointed as it and all their other videos on this subject were recorded at super long play and the grainyness made it difficult to really see all that was presented. There really is no excuse to charge Standard Play rates for Super Long Play videos."
3,Good collection of essays on U.S. president,"Rivals for Power is an interesting collection of essays edited by James Thurber with the intent of exploring what the roots of rivalry between the president and Congress are. The chapters in the book present original research organized around several themes and written from a variety of perspectives. Political scientists, legal scholars, historians, journalists, former White House and Capitol Hill staff, and former members of Congress all contribute.The essays are quite appropriate and do a great job in helping to improve the understanding of presidential-congressional relations by combining firsthand experiences with academic analyses. This book is recommended to all interested in the U.S. presidency, especially as it relates to Congress."
4,He who speaks volumes but doesn't get heard,"Moby's ""Ambient"" is a good album, not a great album, but a good one. It isn't Brian Eno or Aphex Twin ambient, it is closer to Orb ambient. In that respect it succeeds, I can pop it in the CD player and let it play through and tap my foot occassionally. It isn't quite as self-indulgent as a lot of the pretentious ambient artists out there, names aren't going to be mentioned, you'll know when you hear them. Moby has a sense of a good melody, and stays with it. The highlight tracks are Myopia, Sound, and Lean on Me. It is quality, and I recommend without hesitation."
2,muzak,"I don't relish this opportunity to become unpopular with Moby fans. First, if Moby wants to name his CD ""AMBIENT"", and if pundits want to file this under the section ""AMBIENT"", that's fine with me. Like so much else in that genre, the music on this CD is too distracting to be faithful to the term. That is probably an endless argument whose distinction is lost on most people buying this CD. I suppose, if forced to classify this music, my personal definition would ""WALLPAPER"". While the songs are too distracting for me to ignore, they are also lacking in depth or imagination which would make them interesting for me to listen to. Changing instrumentation for example on J BREAS isn't enough to hold my interest. So there you have it. I don't think that it is an horrible or awful CD, and many, many people will enjoy it. At the same time, I don't find the music at all compelling. Sorry. :["
3,Not ambient to me,"As the title suggests, the music on this albumn is without lyrics and is intended to be background music. Perhaps my overly-stimulated 16 year-old would consider it soothing background music. For this forty something, it is just a little too... something to passively listen to. Aside from ""J Breas,"" ""Piano and String,"" ""80,"" and ""Lean on Me,"" the songs are much too jarring for ambient music. Most of the songs I enjoy but I certainly couldn't listen to them while I read, write, or did anything else requiring concentration."
2,Disappointing outing for Moby,"I'm a huge fan of Moby. I own Moby, I Love to Score, Everything is Wrong, Animal Rights, Play and 18. I love them all with a passion. I love to chill out with Play & 18, and get dancing with Moby. Sadly, I didn't enjoy this.Probably the most major problem I have is the title.I call Brian Eno's The Drop Ambient. This album isn't ambient. The music is quite jarring, and isn't soothing like play and 18.Probably the most interesting thing about this album is the cover. It's the first time I've seen Moby properly with hair. ;)"
2,Worthless music,"This is what I like to call ""worthless music"". What makes it worthless? Well first of all it's supposed to be 'ambient' music, hence the name. Sorry Moby, but this stuff ain't ambient. Ambient music is music you lose yourself in and can meditate to and has no real tempo or consistant rhythem. This is NOT ambient music. So what could it be? Well, it's not regular music....besides a couple tracks (which earned it the extra star in my score) this album has no creativity nor does it have any musical or melodic value. So you can't just sit down and listen to it. It just ends up being nothing but distracting. And to top it off, many of the songs sound like midi!I cannot recommend this album, and regret buying it."
4,Good if you want to hear early Moby,"This is one of Moby's cd's on the Instict label.The mix is truly experimental.There are good ideas throughout.Tracks like Bad Days,J Breas and Myopia are interesting.As some of the others have mentioned ,there aren't any standout tracks.There are much more memorable and beautiful tracks on his I like to score,Little Idiot and Play-B sides cd's.This collection will only mostly disappoint someone looking for a pleasurable and stirring listen."
4,like a sweet dream,Song 2 says it all.HEAVEN.Great for any cuddle fest on a cold winter night or a hot summer afternoon. Nice tunes for a vegan dinner party. This could be very soothing to hear while taking a nice long bath with some candles lit and maybe some mister bubble in the tubble...Another Gem by the maestro Moby!
2,"Not ambient in the least, just a pretentious title","I got this CD out of curiosity, and I haven't listened to it since I the first time I opened it. You don't get 'ambient' music on this album, you get techno beats and some rhythms pasted on it. When Moby made Hotel, and released the ambient CD with it, that was what I had expected from an ambient album, this isn't it at all. Moby doesn't touch ambient music until 'Everything Is Wrong' which coincidentally is when Moby starts reaching popularity from an audience that doesn't consist of just techno-ravers. Well, some of these tracks are decent and worth listening to, but the overall pretensions of it being an 'ambient' track is almost embarrassing after knowing what wonderful music Moby is actually capable of without merely sticking labels onto everything."
5,Wonderful read,This is a lovely book to read. Heartwarming and real. I had trouble finding it as I presume out of print and the author is no longer with us. So many of his comments on cats have stuck with me Like: 'cats know where there is a vacancy'.
1,Terribly outdated,"As a professional working with at risk and disable youth and as the sister of someone with Autism, I do not recommend this book to anyone. It's completely outdated. The woman's anger in this book is very evident, but she whines and complains instead of taking any action. Her ""survival"" techniques are based on her experience and would help very few people, in my opinion."
2,insulting and waste of money,"I got this for my husband to help with our parenting problems, but after listening to it I couldn't give it to him. It is insulting and not helpful in the least. I would look for another source. I liked the information found in some montessori books more."
4,Intellectual and Enlightening!,"I agree with the Costa Rican reviewer, Gudmundson lifts the liberal blinders that coffee barons lead to an agricultural hegemony completely detrimental to the previous ways of life!Another book which lucidly discusses these issues is ""Costa Rica: The Last Country The Gods Made"" by Colesberry & McLean, in the chapter, ""Coffee! Costa Rica's First Revolution.""I recommend both books for enlightened reading!"
2,Less instruction than I anticipated,This book was more Jim McLean telling stories about how great golfers have played and less about telling you how to hit the shots. The descriptions lacked necessary details to let the reader know how to uncertain shots...really let down by this.
4,Verbatim Digital Vinyl 700 MB Multicolor CD-R Spindle (25 Discs),"While not 100% in non-defective rate, Verbatim performs much better than average. In addition, the Digital Vinyl disc are among the most attractive in the industry."
4,pretty,"To Verbatim's credit, on their website, it says:""Digital Vinyl CD-R's are only compatible for music recording on computer recorders.""The look nice which is why they cost more. Verbatim does make extras labels for use with these discs and their own labeling system."
3,They're PRETTY!,"Coming from the 60s generation, I love the '45rpm' look of these discs, but I'm still trying to figure out how to record music on them so that they play not only on my computer's CD player but on other players as well. Still working on that???"
4,"Works fine, as expected","This is just your regular CD-R. I use to burn music so that I can play it in my car.The Vinyl look on the top is nice, and gives it a bit of a retro-like appeal. I would definitely recommend it."
1,not for my machine.,"I bought these because they are made to look like old 45's. I figuered because of this, they were audio cd's. I put one in my Philips 770 cd rrecorder and it scrolled""WRONG DISC""USE AUDIO DISC"". I don't know if it's my recorder or not. If I use a disc that plainly says For Music or For Audio Use, I have no problem. Buyer beware."
3,8% error rate isn't good,Two of our discs would not record. These are REAL cool looking and my youngest boy loves putting his music on them since they look like records (we have an LP player from the 70s that we still actually use sometimes!). But 2 of the 25 discs would not record and that is too high (and costly) of an error rate. We'll stick with Sony brand in the future.
3,Not AZO Dye,"This is not the first time I have purchased Verbatim's Digital Vinyl discs. I love the way they look, and they're always a big hit when I give them to friends. They were worth the extra money because they look cool, and I have found the AZO dye very reliable. I was disappointed, however, that this pack does not have the AZO dye, as is promised in the discription. They are made in Taiwan, making them no different (quality wise) than much less expensive discs - had I known that, I wouldn't have spent the extra money for them."
4,Nice looking CDs,"These CDs look very nice and they play fine too as long as you burn them at a lower speed. Well, what speed? That is what you have to figure out the hard way. And you would think that Verbatim will mention the burn speed on the packaging, but they don't. I wasted a couple of CDs to realize that if I burn them at 12X on my ATT burner then it is no good (first couple of songs are bad and then it plays fine after that). Then I burned them at 4x and it plays just fine in the three different CD players that I have. I think that it will be fine too if I burn them at 8x but I have not tried that yet. You would have figure out yourself what is the ideal burn x on your system.I do not care if I have to burn these CDs at a lower rate (because I let it burn while I do other things), but I am giving it 4 stars because Verbatim should have mentioned it on the pacakage what should be the ideal burn rate. Otherwise these are very nice looking CDs."
1,bad discs!,I got a multi-pack of these and burned CD's for stocking stuffers for my family. I think they are thicker than normal CD's because they got stuck in 2 CD players......one is in my car and I still can't get it out. DON'T PURCHASE
3,Nice looking but unreliable,"I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that these were incredibly marked down at the local Best Buy. I like the look of these CD-Rs but they have been unreliable and unpredictable in terms of device playback. For instance, they play fine in my brand new car stereo, and on my firewire external CDRW drive at home, but have difficulty playing back in my Powerbook internal drive (most likely due to the thickness of the painted surface, which is more a fault of the drive than the discs) and completely do not play in my home CD player (which is a stand-alone component disc changer). In other players, playback has ranged from nonexistent (as already noted), to spotty at best (crackles and lots of extra digital noise) to crystal clear.I would only recommend using these if you can verify and guarantee playback on your most-used personal systems... otherwise you'll end up with a stack of nice looking but unlistenable CDs."
2,"Great looking discs, but be prepared to have too many coasters","I purchased these discs for use as gifts to others because of how great they look. Unfortunately, that is their only redeeming quality.The discs themselves say '52x speed', but do not, under any circumstances, write the discs at any speed over 8x. Writing at slower speeds helps, but will not guarantee a successful burn. In my pack of 25 discs, less than half burned without write errors. Before using these discs, I don't remember the last time I had a single write error when burning CD-Rs with my current setup. Caveat emptor.As for aesthetics, the discs look absolutely terrific. It's too bad most of them ended up as rubbish.Again, buyer beware."
4,These look and work great!,"These burn/play as you would expect and the vinyl covering looks great. There is plenty of space to make your notes on the CD and the multiple colors makes it easy to tell them apart.The only negative I have is that the bottom side of the CDs are the normal silver CD color. It would have been nice if the bottom was black too, but I'm not sure if that would read properly."
5,love the design,"Really love the look.Since it's CD-R, it only gives you one chance to burn it. Take care of them. :)"
3,The good and the bad of the Tagco Garlic Cooker.,"The good is it is as easy to roast garlic as you could hope. Also, you don't have to heat the whole oven and house to cook the garlic. The down side is an issues of preference. I like roasted garlic somewhat caramalized. Actually, I think it's great when a few of the cloves are almost crispy. I couldn't get this with Tagco Garlic Cooker. There is a ceramic ""donut"" at the bottom of the cooker that adds moisture. Even when I don't add moisture the garlic comes out fully cooked but soft. I've tried to cook the cloves twice. The garlic get closer to how I like it but: No Cigar.It is fast and easy. Cleanup is a breeze. It's easy to store too."
4,Garlic Roaster,"For the price; does exaxctly what it says, quickly, excellently, and easy to clean. For those of us without the time to peel fresh cloves it works great with the large jar of already peeled cloves. Don't skimp on the olive oil you use with this machine; itt really makes a difference."
4,Perfect - Every time!,"Great product. VERY easy to use and to clean. Be sure you're ready for the garlic smell in the house, though. It's a lovely smell, but not if you're expecting guests who are not planning to eat garlic..."
3,Piggy,"I got this for my two pound chorky. It's actually too big for her, but I think a size smaller would have been too short for her. It's pretty much just a cape, with velcrow and a pig head hood. I am going to have to alter it for the costume contest. I'm glad it was only 8 bucks and free shipping.****Someone asked me how big the pig head is, but I can't find the question anymore to answer directly....so I hope you see this.The pig hood is about 5.5 inch long and 7 inchs wide.The cape from the neck to the base of the tail is about 8inchs long. Girth about 12 inchs."
1,"Bought one, didn't buy another.",We live in the Colorado mountains so come home with snow on our vehicles. I bought this product once but not twice. The hard plastic snap on borders don't work well or last. Carpad which uses garden hoses inserted in sleeves in the borders of their pad work much better. I will never buy anything else. It keeps the water and dirt from running all over the garage floor.
2,Issue with defective parts,I purchased 2 Park Smart Clean Park mats for my two car garage. I had a problem assembling the mats as 5 of the 28 total side rails were defective and did not close. I am currently in contact with the company looking for replacement parts. I will add further review info once I see with how the company deals with the problem.
2,Don't believe the 4hrs....,"This battery is claimed here to be an enhanced BP-315 replacement. It's not... you won't get four hours, you probably will be lucky to get 2 hours. I rekon it may last a bit long than the included BP-308 from Canon, at least on my HV-10. Missing from this item's write-up is any specification... what is the supposed rating on this battery... you would need at least 1800mAh-2000mAh to claim an actual four hours of camcorder operation.With that said, it charged and functioned fine, over the course of several cycles. This is NOT a bad price to pay for a BP-308 ""enhanced replacement"". Had they been honest about the capacity, I would have added more stars."
3,Campy,"This is a fun collection of B (or C class) film mysteries with stars you'll have fun watching before they became big names. The only problem is that the quality of the movies is rather poor due to the condition they were remastered from--these aren't (with a few exceptions) clear digitized and remastered films; they can be grainy, hard to hear and somewhat in disrepair (there is a disclosure statement at the beginning of each film stating this). So if you just want to see the movies because you're a film buff or curious about bygone cinema, this might be a product for you. If you're persnickity about quality, pass it by."
4,Answer to my problem,"I am an oldtimer had not shot for 30 year. always had PSE eqipment at that time I used the old rope & spike back tention release.I tried wrist strap release. I could not hold on target pull the trigger at the same time. then I tried the thumb release with the same results. I started researching other releases and settled on the Tru Ball BT gold Ultra 4 release. Then I hunted for one in my price range, because I wasn't sure if I cound get it to work. Now I am very pleased with the tru ball release and with the products I have purchased from Amazon.Wendy"
5,My Wife Will Finally Go Camping!!,I orginally bought the Pamo Valley and the Power Shower and this was a must have! When we go camping all of my friends wives and my wife can finally go to the bathroom without finding a bush! And they can take nice warm showers when we are in the middle of noware. This whole set up was so much easier and more cost efficient than the orginal idea of buying a R.V. plus we can go camping in all kinds of places that a R.V. can't.
2,Ingredient list missing,"Here is the missing ingredient list and allergy warnings for those of us who have to know.Ingredients:Sugar, Reconstituted Egg White, Wheat Flour, Vegetable Oil, Soya Flour, Glucose-fructose Syrup, Apricot, Glucose Syrup, Humectant (Vegetable Glycerine), Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Milk Protein, Ground Almonds, Dextrose, Rice Flour, Sucrose Syrup, Whey Powder, Raising Agents (Sodium Aluminium Phosphate, Sodium Bicarbonate), Emulsifiers (Mono- and Diglycerides of Fatty Acids, Sodium Stearate), Salt, Colours (Annatto, Cochineal), Gelling Agents (Carrageenan, Pectin), Citric Acid, Tartaric Acid, Acidity Regulators (Sodium Citrates, Acetic Acid), Preservative (Potassium Sorbate), Flavouring.Allergies information:Contains Gluten, Wheat, Wheat Flour, Eggs, Milk, Milk Proteins, Whey Powder, Nuts, Almond, Soya & Soya Flour"
1,Acquired Taste?,Perhaps one had to grow up with it to appreciate it. Overly sweet with a dense consistency and a pasty texture.
3,Great Reference,Great book. Good basis for references.Am a late starter in dance and have found the pictures to be helpful.The book would have been better if it was colored.
2,Not a great book,"Unfortunately, the pictures are much too small and not high enough resolution to see accurately the correct positions. I was quite disappointed, as while the book is very comprehensive, the lack of detail in the photos makes it somewhat useless."
2,"Good book, could use a lesson plan!","This is a wonderful book to reference proper ballet technique. I've returned to dancing on my own, for fitness, after 15 or so years away from proper lessons. With this book as a reference, I'm regaining confidence in how I move. If I were taking actual lessons, I would think it would be truly invaluable.I'm a little disappointed that they didn't provide any sort of sample lesson plan. I had to find that in a different book."
5,Excellent Resource!,"I am a professional dancer and ballet teacher. I bought this book as a reference for myself and my students and have come to rely on it as an invaluable resource. It is a complete guide to ballet with step-by-step pictures and explanations of all beginner, intermediate and advanced steps and is an excellent resource for any teacher, student, or ballet enthusiast!"
5,Absolutely the best!,This book is so detailed and you can actually understand the pictures while reading the text. It is a brilliant manual and I would recommend it to any and every ballet student.
5,Classical Ballet Technique,I have been using this technique book for over 20 years and I recommend it to all by students and feel is it is a wonderful guide for learning ballet plus it should each movement and explains in detail step by step.
5,You gotta have it,"I bought it around the time when I first started ballet at the age of 15. I was kinda clueless about all the terms...but the pictures were so inspiring!Now as a teacher, its an invaluable book. Full of pictures breaking down steps into clear bits. Wonderful!"
3,paperback was good condition,"If you are going to be using this book alot, I would suggest getting a hard cover version. because there are soo many pages and its heavy weight will make it difficult to keep in a good condition when in paperback. other than that its exactly what I needed."
5,"""Well Pleased!!""","I have been an FFH fan for a long time, and this CD is not to be compared to the rest of them...way to go FFH! This CD is such a great reminder of the love that Christ has for us. Yes, we may walk away sometimes, but Christ is always there, always opening his arms to us, wanting us back-(even across the ""Grand Caynon""). We need to stand in the truth and be bold in this present evil world. We can do this through Christ that strengthes us. It is becuase of what Christ did for us at the Cross. He died and rose again and if we just believe this, we can have eternal life with him and understand this love. FFH does a great job of sharing this love with it's listeners. Thanks, FFH for your ministry in the Lord."
1,A Different Opinion,"While I agree that all FFH CDs do sound somewhat the same, if I want radically different, I will listen to some other group. Just as I didn't want the Beach Boys sounding like The Beatles, I didn't want FFH to try to sound like whoever they were trying to sound like.Frankly, I thought their CDs started downhill with ""Still the Cross,"" and ""Voice From Home"" continued the downward spiral, to the point where I never play it. For some reason Jeremy and the others weren't content using their talents the way they had in the past, and decided they needed to do something ""artsy."" They failed and disappointed their fans in the process."
5,Gimme Spoon!,"I bought 2 albums by spoon, first GA GA GA GA GA, and then Gimme Fiction. If I did it again, I'd problem buy them in the reverse order, but I would have still purchased both. The reason I say this is that Gimme Fiction is a good introduction to Spoon's sound. And while I'm not an expert on Spoon, I'd say this is more 'classic' Spoon. GA GA GA, while still very good seems more experimental to me. I would probably give GA GA GA a 4/5 stars, but I recommend both! From Gimme Fiction, you might recognize ""Turn my Camera on"" from the radio, and ""Mathematical Mind"" if you've seen 'Stranger than Fiction.' Give Spoon a try, it's great to hear something different now and than. And while you may recognize who some of their influences may be, they have definitely created a unique sound."
5,Flipping sweet!!,"I was surprised by this CD. I downloaded the free track, I Turn My Camera On, at Amazon's free downloads page, and I liked the song, but not adored it. I was not planning on buying it. This christmas, though, my mom bought this cd, saying ""the salesperson said it was a great cd."" I listened to it, and I was surprised. It was excellent. From the opening ""The Beast and Dragon, Adored"", to the excellent ending of ""Merchants of Soul"", this CD is so catchy. I can not stop whistling ""I summon you"", which is easily their best track. This is just an excellent cd. I am now going to acquire the rest of Spoon's discography."
3,"Reliably solid, but trails off some in latter portion","3 1/2Just missing their typically way-above-average album status, the indie pop rock group's 5th release starts strong with their witty and infectious songwriting taking front and center, but looses some wind throughout a decent but less noticeable second half."
4,Great Album,"Strong, diverse album. Almost as good as later ""Ga, Ga, Ga...."" which in my book is saying a lot. By the way I'm 60 and I really enjoy Spoon. While rock hardly thrives today there are still many quality acts out there. Some, like Spoon, even have longevity."
5,Killer Album,"Great album, just bought it on vinyl. Britt Daniels voice sings with enthusiasm as the band executes brilliant tracks such as ""The Two Sides of Mousier Valentines"", with its clever lyrics, ""I Turn My Camera On"", with minimalist funk-dance vibes. I highly reccomend it. Also check out ""Kill The Moonlight, Spoon's previous album."
3,Get Spoonfed,"It's a testimony to America's finest rock band that sub-Spoon is still better than primo-everybody else. That said, there are two Spoons, the band that spews perfect pop ditties in their sleep and the Spoon that sometimes pepper that pop with groovy, weird prince-like asides. Spoon took a huge risk with Kill the Moonlight and made an album full of the weird stuff and the result was their breakthrough: their finest album to date. Now comes Gimme Fiction and they play it safe. The result: the first Spoon Album one has to grow to like. It's pleasing enough and sometimes even brilliant but the two breakouts, I Turn My Camera On (easily 2005's greatest single) and Was It You are great blasts of purple sexiness that not only proves that Outkast was trying too hard and Prince not hard enough, but also hints at the masterpiece that could have been. Still worth your money though."
5,Thank God for Spoon!,"How do you measure one great release after another? Is this album better than that one or that one or that one...? Earlier work vs. later work...? Spoon is a great band to trace from stage to stage, year to year, and that is definitely a recommended treat. But it's time and place that makes ""context"" so it's not really the point. And here's my point: Don't pay attention to the comparative press. This great Spoon album is every bit as wonderful as their earlier albums, and I have them all. GIMME FICTION will blow away long time Spoon fans and first time listeners, probably even more."
5,Best Unknown Band in the USA,"This CD confirms that Spoon are the best unknown band in the country. They probably won't stay unknown for long after this masterpiece. The album starts with all guns firing, with the two best songs on the CD. The highlight is ""Monsieur Valentine"", a track that will stay in your head all day, even after just one listen. The rest of the CD is top-notch, with no filler whatsoever....One of the year's best!!!!"
3,Spoon go stadium,"I loved Kill The Moonlight: there was a unique sensiblity to its sparse, close-in-to-the-mic production. Gimme Fiction goes stadium on you, and it makes you bored. When you no longer feel like you can reach out and touch Britt Daniels' face, you lose half the Spoon magic. When they replace the weary insight of their previous lyrics with cliched rock posing, you love the other half. It's a real shame."
5,The Best Since The Beatles,"Spoon is a great band and all the songs show how much Spoon has improved over the years. The Beast And Dragon Adored shows Pink Floyd and Sonic Youth Influences,this is clearly the best song on the album. Two Sides of Monsieur valentine makes an ode to punk legend Elvis Costello, Britt Daniels voice is so good on this one. I turn my camera on is a post-punk sound that is similar to the Medium and Gang of Four. In Sister Jack, Daniels does his best Pete Townshend impression and there is a really great guitar attack on this song. Spoon reminds of how much the British Invasion really matters."
3,disappointed...,"i have loved spoon for years... so far be it from me to criticize their choices, because i do trust them. and i do think this ilbum is a segue to something great looming in their future...BUT....i really can't understand all the hype about this album, considering their other work. If you are not familiar with spoon's history, I can see the appeal of Gimme Fiction; but in comparison to A Series of Sneaks or Girls Can Tell, it is empty and sugar-coated. The lyrics no longer mean as much as they used to, and the music is fun but equally vapid...I wish Britt Daniel would stop trying to become the indie icon he deserves to be and just let it flow!I don't know, maybe I'm missing something here, but in my opinion Spoon needs to hack out a new one FAST and GRITTY the way I like it, because I was sick of this album before it was even released."
3,Worth buying,"Worth buying for one song ""I Turn My Camera On"" - ingenious. Other songs flow in and out of your ears leaving nothing."
5,Awesome album!,"This is the first Spoon CD I've bought. A friend played me GaGaGaGaGa and I thought it was good but not great. I purchased this on a whim and like it a lot more. Music is very different, almost minimalistic in nature but packs a heavy punch. I thoroughly enjoy this album and recommend it wholeheartedly; it's a breath of fresh air. 'Mathematical Mind' and 'Was it you' are my two favorites but the entire disc is solid. Buy it without reservation!"
5,entertain me to the max!,"This has to be the best motivational song robbie has done to date. I could dance and scream all night long. I found this disc else where and wish i had found it here, i could've saved $. This disc is a must have for all true rogue fans, Kiss, eat four heart out! This is so sexy paul stanley can now retire!"
3,my opinion,"the book is pretty wood, it has great conditions and its perfect and it will help me a lot. i received on time and im having a great experience with it"
4,Auto Ventshade model number,"It turned out that I had to return this particular item, only because it did not fit my vehicle. And kudos to Amazon for their return process - it was extremely efficient and very smooth.The model 25006 was NOT for my particular vehicle even though Amazon said that it was, something that Amazon should probably look into. By going to the Auto Ventshade website, I determined the model number I needed and then ordered that from Amazon."
5,Best looking bug shield!,"Great looking bug shield, easy install. Best price and free shipping from Amazon.thanks!"
4,Good Replacement,This product was an exact replacement for the one I previously had. It was easy to install and the price was as competitive or cheaper than other sellers I found.
1,Doesn't work for 2003 Ford Explorer,I was buying the bug guard for my 2003 Ford Explorer and searched by model and was told this part fits my vehicle. Either the wrong bug shield was in the box or it just doesn't fit.
1,No fear for a man waching the birth!,Oh... I just checked and found out the author died in 1958.I am sure by now he is back to this world as a woman and now experiencing 12 or more child birth without any pain and fear! Imagine that!!!!!!
3,Design flaw?,"The gear from the handheld remote/motor that propelled the rest of the robot stripped with less than an hour of use. Thus, the power would spin the first gear, but that gear would not catch to turn any subsequent gears and the robot would not move. It was a lot of fun the first time, but it's just a statue if it won't move. I had to send it back."
2,Disappointing,"Learning Resources Gearbotics Robot Motorized SetThis potentially great toy was a great disappointment because the gears broke after the first half hour of play. After reading other reviews, I saw that this is the normal situation with this toy. The plastic gears shredded into a pile of plastic shavings in the clear plastic ""motor box."" My grandson can still build robots with the parts (with a little adult help); but the motor doesn't work at all. This product is not worth the price and doesn't live up to the advertisement."
3,"Not bad, could be better...","I bought this for my 6 year old son. He is quite intelligent for his age and capable of reading directions, but he will not even attempt this without my help. The first time I put one together, I understood why... even for the adult, there are directions that can be confusing. Plus, once it is complete, it can be precarious; a wheel or gear might fall off. You can't really expect a young child to use this independently and continue to want to do it. There is a cool factor but know it will require you, the adult, every time."
1,Good idea ruined by cheap plastic motor gears,"As others have mentioned, the plastic reduction gears in the clear motor assembly quickly stripped rendering the motor useless. They should not be difficult to replace; however, there is no mention of replacement gears in the Learning Resources web-site.Thumbs down on what would have otherwise been an interesting toy."
3,"Hours of fun, unless it breaks!","My 5-year-old son loves this robot. He plays with it for hours, building and rebuilding. However, it was an extreme disappointment when the first robot's motor broke on the first use. We returned the product and exchanged it for a new one. We have had it for a couple of months and it is still working. Keeping our fingers crossed because he loves it!"
3,Book was not very good as mentioned by the seller,Book was not very good. So informed same to seller. Seller was very nice and contacted me immediately. Happy with dealing with the seller. As book was not good condition I informed seller to make it Good in stead of very good condition
3,Overpriced,The quality on these torx sockets is not the greatest. I use them with a standard ratchet driver and they showed wear/damage after their 1st use. They are not advertised as being impact sockets on amazon.com but their packaging claims them to be. I haven't tried them with my impact gun (out of fear) but would assume they would have a very short life. Overall not a terrible tool but don't expect to pass these onto your children as they will sooner end up striped in the trash.
1,Pelican Submersible,"I bought the Pelican Stealthlite 2410 recoil LED submersible for snorkeling at night. After using it one it started flashing on and off, and turning on, even with the switch off. When I contacted Pelican about this they told me I had bought the 2410PL, that this one wasn't waterproof and that only the 2410N was waterproof to 500'. If pelicans website makes this distinction, it couldn't have been less clear, when I bought my light, and the light itself doesn't tell you if you've bought the 2410PL, 2410N, or the 2410PLC.Bottom line. It seem the only way to tell if your 2410 light is going to be waterproof is to get it wet!"
2,Maybe not worth the money........,"Hello,I bought this model about two months ago... Has a great fit in the palm of your hand, focused beam, nice easy on/off switch, but a so-so amount of light.. I bought a 2nd light two weeks ago and other than the housing, it's a totally different light.The second light has a very bright BUT un-focused beam and an on/off switch that was created by the ""Flintstones"".The product has great promise but fails to deliver at this point. There is such an inconsistancy between these two lights that I will look elsewhere going forward. It's just not worth $30. or $40 dollars.."
2,Not Really Worth $40.00,"I own two of these lghts and have had to send both of them back to Pelican for ""adjustment"".While this flashlight has been highly rated, I can tell you that having two to compare side by side showed me what a difference there was between the two.The first one I purchased had a nice tight beam, nice working on/off switch, but not such a bright light. The second had an on/off switch that must have been made by the Flintstones; Bright light, totally unfocused.There is apparently no one working in Quality Control for Pelican Products.As a suggestion, go look elsewhere for a good LED light."
2,Not what I ordered,"I ordered, per web ad, a Sylvania branded product - was shipped DAMAR brand which was available elsewhere for less. Product did not function and did not fit well - about a inch diameter off. Gave up and ordered a complete new fixture which used a GE product. The main beef I have is that the vendor did not ask if a substitute brand was OK to ship."
2,Settlement Cook Book,"We received our order very quickly and well packaged. However the book was described as being in""Acceptable"" Condition. The book we received was detached from its cover and the cover itself was taped together with red duct tape."
2,A cookbook to share,This is an updated version of a cookbook that my mother had most of her adult life. I wanted to give a copy to my new granddaugter in law. She was very pleased with it.It arrived quickly and condition was very good.
2,Cook Book,This is a very abbreviated copy of the original. I was very disappointed as I bought it for my daughter and wanted the same copy that was given to me....by my Mom......years ago. Not even half the size!
5,Vic Firth.... Yes!,My 1st pair of drum sticks very happy with them .just got another pair in black i hope to put alot of wear & tear on them.
4,Good sticks,"My 8th graders are literally beating the crap out of these sticks. They are good and reasonably priced. The principal is mad at me because I told them that a real drummer plays constantly, so the walls in the halls, cafeteria tables, and classroom desks are getting pounded constantly."
5,Excelent!!,"Thank you very much, excellent product, i would recommend it 100% i got in the estimated time, the product is very lightweight and durable"
2,Wanted nylon tips,He wasnt impressed. My mistake. It arrived quickly. No problems but I do not like the requirements for writing a bunch of stuff on each item
3,One of the drumsticks broke,"I'm sure these are very nice drumsticks, but one of them broke soon after the teenager started using them. I think he needs the cheapest ones I can buy and lots of them."
1,NOVAs in Disguise,"I was VERY disappointed to receive a pair of Vic Firth ""NOVA"" drumsticks instead of the ""AMERICAN CLASSIC"" drumsticks I ordered. NOVA sticks are crap. They sell for $3.99 on Amazon and break easily. I ordered two pairs of AMERICAN CLASSICS and got two pairs of NOVAS in black sleeves with a white barcode sticker that says ""American Classic"". Not cool, but not worth the hassle of returning. BEWARE."
3,Cheap,The drum sticks were ok but very cheaply made. They will serve their purpose. I don't think they are worth the money.
2,Disappointed,"Okay, I've used Vic Firths my whole life. I actually usually use the 5B's, but I thought I'd change things up with the 5A All-Americans. This wasn't a good decision. The sticks broke within three days of use.I will stick with Vic Firths for the rest of my days, but I will not buy another set of 5A's until someone proves to me that I just got a bad batch of sticks. I definitely recommend the Vic Firth 5B sticks."
5,great drum,"I bought this toy two years ago for my three year son. He banged on it, sat on it, and stood on it. It is durable, fun, and sounds great. My husband and I bang on it occasionally to."
5,Quality Product!,The WESTIN Signature Nerf Bars are a quality product. We are very happy with the product and easy installation.
3,Incorrect wire retaining clip orientation.,"The retaining clips that hold the wires into the cap are oriented incorrectly. looking from the top of the engine, the factory clips are located in the 10 o'clock position, while the Bosche clips are located at the 2 o'clock position. I had to reuse the factory toyota clips to make everything fit together properly."
5,Just what was expected,"Having used Bosch auto electric parts for years on german cars, I bought these for a friends Toyota Tacoma, and was very impressed with both the quality and the fitment, they actually fit better than the skiny wires that came as oe! They were also less expensive on amazon than most of the oem brands!"
5,"Deft plotting, good characterization","Twist Phelan brings a deft skill of resolving complexities in the courtroom to HEIR APPARENT, weaving a convincing tale filled with surprising twists and convolutions. The novel begins at a measured pace, setting a scene that cleverly overlaps the world of a law firm with the world of rodeo cowboys. Rich characterizations provide an abundance of suspects that will keep readers guessing."
5,The Moosepath League rides again,"A worthy successor to Van Reid's delightful _Cordelia Underwood_, _Mollie Peer_ gives us another plucky, clever heroine on an adventure fraught with mystery and peril. Tall tales, eccentric characters, and charming descriptions of New England scenery abound. Luckily for us, the formula still works."
1,Even More Random Than Earlier Books,"It's science fiction with completely wrong science! It's slice of life without any character development! It's a cookie-cutter plot formula done badly! It's book three of a series, but introduces tons of new characters with no reader attachment. I fell asleep reading it.To be a good story, the novel needed to be combined with book two and actually edited. What happens with the Farmers is exceptionally idiotic. A ghost writer likely had major input in this book, as opposed to an editor. If you've read other McCaffery, it's like someone hollowed out the work, took all the emotional and interesting parts out, and published this pile of excess words, consisting of small talk and meetings.Do yourself a favor and avoidFreedom's Ransom. Book four is even worse because even the pretense of using actual science is gone."
2,Disappointing,"After waiting for so long for a conclusion to the trilogy, I was sadly disapointed. ""Freedom's Challenge"" just doesn't have the same flair as the previous two books. It was not as gripping, almost as if Ms McCaffrey had written it to satisfy her readers and just finish the series."
3,Entertaining but inconclusive.,"Whil the author is finishing the series and concluding the plot, she forgets to include reality. The book is not worth the hardcover price but will definitely be worth reading for the paperback. I waited (ever so impatiently) for this book to come out only to be very disappointed. Too many gaps with too much filler in other spots of the book. While mildly entertaining, this book is not up to Miss Mccaffrey's normal standard of writing."
2,What the FUDGE was she thinking?,"WOW!!! Don't want to give away the plot if you haven't read this book, but you have got to be kidding me. I really like a good contemporary/urban/sci-fi/fiction story line. Throw in a little romance with another species and I'm happy to dedicate my time and energy to read what's written. But when the author turns the so-called heroine into an unrestrained, drunken, helpless female, at the mercy of any man who can get her drunk and pregnant enough, it goes way wrong. For it to happen to the ""faithful to one man"" Kris once was bad enough, but twice. Give your readers more credit than that. Where is the moral fiber of not only the heroine but also of the so called men who claim to have so much respect for her skills (outside of the bedroom)? Again WOW!!!"
3,"Good, but not the best of the three books in this series","While I thoroughly enjoyed this series -- my first introduction to McCaffrey books -- this was my least favorite of the three. It was enjoyable but for some reason it didn't ""grab"" me like the previous two did. However, I would still recommend it because the series is enjoyable."
3,a new world and a new saga in the style of Pern!,This is the beginning or a new world! The story never really began. it is more like an introduction and we're waiting for the next book. Hope it is soon!!
5,Books you will read and reread again and again!,This and the two books before are page turners. You will not be able to put them down. In this book you learn what is now to be done with the Eosi to free Botany and Earth. It will make you cheer. Thank you Ms. Mc Caffery for givng us another world to live through. I hope this is not the last in the series.
3,Low budget film has appeal...,"""Mammoth""(2006) was directed by Tim Cox. This isn't a big budget action sci-fi movie. Its budget was modest and so the story focuses on the quirky humour and characters rather than on blowing us away with special effects, and for this reason the film was a pleasant surprise. Tom Skerritt, Summer Glau, Leila Arcieri, and Vicent Ventresca star in this film about a museum mammoth that is brought back to life and terrorizes a town.This DVD looks surprisingly fine on a big screen tv. The colors are rich and the blacks are deep. Even the clarity is very good."
4,Totally laughable and enjoyable,"This is one of those movies that is SO bad it is actually good. The section that I like the most is the part where the hand is put into a microwave and taps on the glass. That entire section of the movie is one where you will laugh out loud. Also, who can resist a Summer Glau movie?"
4,One of the Good Ones,"Usually Sci Fi channel movies are heavy with the cheese, sparse with the plot, and graphics that make someone born after '80 cringe. And yes Mammoth give us a completely ridiculous plot; a mammoth that had been possessed by an alien right before it was flash-freezed defrosts in modern day and wrecks havoc. But the acting is amazing, the cheese is sweet and you'll love the characters, especially Vincent Ventresca's Dr. Frank, like they're your social awkward best friend.I'm keeping back only one star because the DVD lacks any kind of special features, in spite of it's UNRATED proclamation, and it doesn't have any subtitles. I love subtitles so this is more a personal choice than an overall criticism. But when you think about it, in this inclusive genre and era not having subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing Sci-Fi lovers is just lazy."
2,Disappointing Even for Grade B,"I like cheesy grade b movies for casual entertainment. Grade B has almost become more the 'Budget' that is low budget, it's also becoming a Flag for cheesy, simplistic, fun to watch without a meaning or purpose film. Mammoth was extremely disappointing. I like Tom Skerrit as an actor most of the time. I also like 'animal on rampage' Grade B movies. Many of the Maneater series are terrific Grade B's, along with some like Yeti, Rogue, Prey, etc. These movies decided to either have a 'message/serious' presentation, or be outlandishly fun to watch. Mammoth tried but didn't succeed in doing both. If you're looking for a fun Grade B try Wyvern, Prey, Rogue, Rise of the Gargoyles, most any of the 'Anaconda' movies but avoid Mammoth. Rent it just to see what a bad grade B movie is or buy it and give to a friend or relative you want to get even with."
3,MAMMOTH,"It is an average movie about a historical Mammoth that is awaken and goes loose after being hit by meteor, it is good for children."
2,A zombie mammoth sucks the souls out of people?,"This movie would be completely passed by if no one took interest from Summer Glau (Sarah Conner Chronicles - Terminator) being in it.The whole concept of this movie is stale and boring. A guy owns a museum, in it is a Mammoth in ice that he finds an alien device in that triggers aliens sending some probe to earth to take over the Mammoth like a zombie, or mummy or something. So the Mammoth comes back to life and sucks the souls out of people.I could not bare to sit through any more then 30 mins of this, it was just going no where and getting more ridicules as it went on... Why would a mammoth come back to life to suck souls out of people? If it was explained, I really do not care for such a stupid plot."
2,Good try.....,"Loved the beginning title..they had class, kept me interested and reallywas looking toward a good movie, but.... . What we have here is a mixtureof stuff that works great or does'nt work. Im talking about the acting,the visuals the flow of the movie the music. If all worked then we wouldhave a 4 star movie..but there is just too much that does'nt work thatbring this creature movie to a 2 star. Some of the stuff that did notwork were ...grampa actor(not convincing)...some of the music...actingwent above stupid for some parts...Sherrif's deputies...you gotta be kidding.... So in the end i can only suggest this movie is only good fora view... Not a keeper."
5,maeve johnson!! this is an awesome book!!,hey this book is very cool! i think everyone should read it.. even if u r afraid of clowns!! the clown in this book is the bestest clown ever!! so anyways i recomend this book to anyone!! 4 all ages!
1,Don't buy this!,Don't buy this DVD. It is a low budget video of someone's dogs playing and barking. At first we found it entertaining for our dogs until he went outside to have the dogs play in the yard. The boxer continually barked and jumped all over the poor old shepherd who was obviously very painful in the hind end. Even after the dog cried out in pain the play was allowed to continue. I am a veterinarian and I know a painful dog when I see it. These two dogs should not be allowed to play together. Since the filmmaker was not smart enough to figure this out my guess is that I won't enjoy the rest of the video either. I will not be playing it for my dogs.
1,Terrible!,"This DVD is terrible! Hard to give it even one star. It is amature video over-dubed by sound tracks that don't even match the video being shown. Our dog had NO interest. Random footage of cats, goats, ostrichs, suburban playdates in ugly yards while you hear the sounds of dogs playing and a man's voice saying ""Good boy"" over and over that has nothing to do with what you are viewing??? Dramatically opposite of the other DVD for Dogs that we purchased (While you Are Gone) that was excellent. Don't waste your money on this ridiculous DVD!"
3,not what I expected,"It appeared to be a ""home made "" video and I was expecting something more professional. My dog barks the entire time it is playing and not sure if that means he likes it. For me hearing ""good boy"" repeatedly was annoying but then it is for my dog . Personally I would not recommend it."
2,low production quality - not really working for a dog,"the production quality was lower than low budget - it looked like someone just decided to ""film"" their house pets and sell the dvd. But I am impressed with them finding a market niche ripe for some exploring."
2,Bad Dog Video,"Sorry, this is a great idea, but the content of this video, supposedly filmed by ""experts"" is nothing more than someone's home move clips of cats, dogs, rats, etc. And I would have thought that if I was filming canine antics in the backyard, I would have picked up the dog poop first. It does keep my dog semi-entertained while I am out. But I could do much better with my little JCV video camera."
3,good dog entertainment,"I purchased 2 DVD's and my dogs are thrilled. My dogs enjoyed the movie. My dog even learned a few things.Awesome fun and a delight to watch!Since then, I purchased the latest movie of Marmaduke. Out of all the dvd's I've purchased for my dogs, Marmaduke got there complete attention, like I've never seen.It all depends on the animal's interest. Tough call to say.Rose and Diane"
5,Great DVD for my puppy!,I have a puppy and this DVD is a Godsend! He loves it and so doI! Thank you... now I just need one for my kids!
5,Piece of mind while dogs are alone,"After finding a great DVD for cats I wanted to find one for my two dogs as well, because they are left alone a lot and would benefit from it. I searched and read many reviews as to which one to purchase and DVD for Dogs came up number one pretty much everywhere I searched online. We are very happy with this product and even bought one for a friend too. It's fun watching our two dogs sit down and observe the DVD, the best part is the noises that accompany the film. Their ears prick up constantly throughout the show.THE DVD FOR DOGS: The Ultimate Dog Sitter DVD"
1,4 cats...1 dog...no interest....,I purchased video for my toy fox terrier puppy. Video is just a home movie of several pets in one small house. Did not look professionally done at all. It looks like a home movie with added noise. None of my pets even looked up when the dvd was in. The toy fox terrier is known for it's fondness of watching tv and yet mine did not even glance up to watch. It was not entertaining for me or my pets.
3,Good book in a question and answer format,"I found this book less informative than others on progesterone such as Dr. Lee's ""What Your Doctor May Not Tell You..."" books or ""The Estrogen Alternative"" But it still covers the basics. It does not contain an extensive reference section or ""lessons"" in biology to answer the biggest question, ""why?"". This is a good book for those who are just learning and have many questions. The question and answer format allows the reader to get direct answers to questions instead of having to read the whole book to get an answer to a specific question."
4,progesterone focused,"Although this book is a bit weak in explanations as to why this is happening to our bodies, I appreciate the fact that the title includes ""Progesterone"". My reason why is that I was prescribed synthetic progesterone when I first started suffering from those perimenopausal problems. I got so depressed it was scary. I stopped them immediately and sought out alternatives... a site where my family has purchased supplements, herbs and vitamins for several years now has a whole section devoted to women's health. There I found some blends that are helping me immensely. I ordered ... a black cohosh blend and a wild yam cream, followed the directions and am feeling much more myself. Although this book doesn't cover it all, it is good for empowering women to not settle for synthetic forms when there are so many natural forms out there. In case you are doing searches for these, another word for these are phytoestrogers. Check them out..."
5,Great Zoppeni look alike,Bought these and they are beatiful. Look to be the same quality as a Zoppenni.
1,I gave it a chance even though I depise him,"I downloaded this album a few days before it came out. I gave it a chance and listened to the whole album and not even one song stood out. It's a very plain album. He even had to make his own record label to put it our, ZNO Records. Before this album he put out 3 others. And everytime he got dropped from the label. He blames people like Eminem for not being able to sell records. Maybe he's not selling records cause he has nothing to offer. All he does is b#tch and complain. And he gets big people like 2 Pac and Lil Jon to boost his own cred. Hes a talentless loser and this album is terrible. If you bought this, then you don't know good rap."
1,This is the Nemesis for everyone who enjoys good rap music,"This CD is junk. Benzino has got to be one of the worst rappers of all time. He's flat out horrible and he's never been good. He disses rappers that are also much more talented and successfual than he is(50, Eminem, G-Unit ect). Eminem killed this punk a long time ago and destroyed his credibility and the credibility of this idiot's washed up magazine. Don't buy this garbage, get Juelz Santana's new album instead. This is by far one of the year's absolute worst albums."
1,Is this guy a joke?,"First of all, why on earth would you ever put ""response to Eminem's Toy Soldiers"" on the back of your cd on one of your songs. What a nightmare this guy is. The song look into my eyes is terrible, he says nothing about the squashed beef except, ""if em wants to squash beef tell him call me."" I hope he calls and tells you that you are whack. Just another ploy to sell a bad cd. Don't buy it, if you don't believe me download one song and you will be a believer"
1,Benzino's nothing but a joke; unnecessary to make a big fuss,"Since the world's been making such a big deal out of Benzino and Eminem, I went to get his album out of curiosity. As it turned out, this plastic ""gangster"" is merely a joke who's trying to churn up controversy with a mainstream rapper, so people would buy his gargage. I admit I fell for it. Oh well, so what if I did buy this album? It just lets me know that Benzino is fake, and now I've got even more respect for Shady and G-Unit. I'm a big time Eminem/50 Cent fan, and I will always remain one. But I guess you can't blame Benzino for staying on Eminem's d*** because after all, this bubblegum punk is getting so old, he needs some major rapper to hold on to. Or I might run to the stores to get him some Viagra if he needs them."
3,THIS IS FOR YA MAN FROM ATLANTA,"""Eminem's stans are gonna get on here and hate on him"" some maybe because of the beef but others, like me, simply because they dont like Benzino..... Ja and Em had a beef and still bought Ja's new album because he stepped his game up; but before I stayed clear of his work because he had fallen off, not because of the beef with EM... as far as Benzino goes... I have never liked him; face it he's not that good of an artist and I dont like his flow.... but I have heard a lot of good things about this new album so Im gonna check it out and if I like it, im gonna do the right thing and give the artist some love and buy the album.... NOT ALL OF EMINEMS FANS HATE FOR THE FACT THAT THERE WAS A BEEF.ill give him the benifit of the doubt and give hime 3 stars if i hear it and like it.... this review will change"
4,zino hit hard,"zino hit hard wit dis joint...this is my fav of all his albums...haters gon hate and most neva even heard the album...so f**k em...he still gon keep making paper...his previous album redemption was a little too comerical...this one he got a few joints fans of ""rock the party"" are gon like but for the most part the album is more raw and street"
1,Give it up,"Benzino can't rap. That's all there is to it. His heart may be in it but if you can't rap, you need to stop trying to rap.He destroyed The Source Magazine. That's enough to make me distrust him. But I wanted to give this a try. I'm probably one of the 10 people he managed to sell this crap to.I don't know who these people are giving it 5 stars, probably editors of The Source who are hired to sit here and praise it non-stop, but that's not the truth. Benzino is behind the beat on every song, waaaaaaaaay behind the beat, so much that the trite messages I've heard a billion times before, except better, don't even get through.People keep sayiing it's his best album to date. IT'S HIS SECOND ALBUM TO DATE. Being better than an album that sold 70,000 records and couldn't even find a street following isn't saying much ya know?This guy is a sellout who can't sell a record. This stuff is the plague.It's awful. Avoid."
1,Time to hang up the gloves,"I have to compare this CD to a boxer. A bad one. He keeps coming into the ring with the best of intentions and the best of his skill but always gets knocked out. The fights are ugly ones, ones you know that he can't win but tries anyways. But even the worst fighter has fans, and thats how I veiw Benzino. Hip-Hops tomato can.Ben pro record 0 wins - 4 loses - 0 draws"
1,This album doenst even deserve a star,"Benzito???????? This guy is a joke, it's insane how much real music is out there and fools are picking this up? Mean streets of Boston???????? Come on, Rochester is worse than Boston, you want something real pick up Dreddy Krugers upcomming"
1,Benzino sucks monkey balls,"Give up benzino it is over. You have been completly destroyed by a better rapper in every sense of the word. I have heard this album and it makes sense that it was a total flop. 21 000, many independent underground artists selll alot more than this. He is a mainstream rapper with lots of marketing tools and still can't sell. This would explain that he should never touch a mic again because he is total trash that sucks monkey balls. He and his pathetic magazine are completely destroyed worst than freeway rhyming capabilities. I bet he now wishes he didn't diss eminem because eninem destroyed what little career benzino had in the first place."
1,Love sub-par rap? Then go no futher!,This album is for you! Even with Scott Storch as a producer this thing is still weak. Even with big named guests (like Tupac) and what not this disc seems forced and it has no real love behind it. There are so many more better rap and hip-hop albums to choose from. Pass this one up.
4,better then I thought,"All in all, this cd really surprised me, Good production and some good songs makes this cd better then most new ones on the market. 'Trying To Make It Through' is the hottest song"
4,www.tensemagazine.com,"Artist: BenzinoTitle: Arch NemesisLabel: Zno RecordsApart from his beef with Eminem, does anyone really know Ray Benzino? He didn't just one day decided to pick up the mic because everyone else was doing it. He's been in the game for years, first as a part of the Almighty RSO and then the Made Men. It's only been in the last few years that he's embarked on a solo career. His new LP Arch Nemesis gives us a taste of what life as Benzino is really like. It contains the monster club hit Bottles & Up produced by Scott Storch and the nicely laced Trying To Make It Through featuring the late great Tupac Shakur. At times Ray veers off course a lil' bit by just having to name-drop Eminem but even still Benzino handles his business. He isn't one of raps elite MC's but he does however, have a story to tell. And does it well. (TenseMagazine)"
2,"Better, but still a turd.",First of all how can anyone rate this CD one star?! I see only the haters doing that. Out of his 4 albums this one is the best but thats not saying much. If you're not a die hard fan of Ben pass this one over.
5,U Can't Handle It,This album is heavy with banging jawnts. Zino is under rated. He came hard on this album. Listen to3. On My Mind4. Bottles & Up (Thug da Club)5. U Can't Handle It9.

1,HORRIBLE PRODUCT! Do NOT be tempted by the price!,"I bought this and it was horrible from the start. Never mind that the instructions are missing sections...once you finally get it together it sucks!It cannot cut through ANY meat and bone as it is advertised. The meat grinder/sausage stuffer is worthless. The blade constantly comes off the track, cutting into the metal shelf. It is crap and should not even be allowed to be sold.I am trying to help people from making the same mistake I did. Plus, I tried to return it and the A**holes agreed, but never gave me a confirmation number. They were completely unreachable after that and they had no phone number to reach them and never responded to my emails, after they said I could return it!This is a slap in the face and a definite case of ""you get what you pay for"". Atleast I din't lose a finger in the process..."
3,For Price of the Item it is not bad.,"Item was damaged when I received.I contact over E mail customer dep.They gave me credit of $30.00.I used once .Machine is not for profesional job ,but around house usage it is not bad.Explanitation how to put together machine was so poor."
2,ToolBook II Review,"The only book out there. It's OK, but full of errors. You have no idea what you're doing until you finish each activity, that is if it is acurate."
1,No Assistance for Assistant Users,"Don't be fooled by the title of this book! Most of the tutorials in the book are geared toward Instructor users only. Often times, the tutorials will walk you through an operation that works in both Assistant and Instructor, but then you run into all of the steps for writing script (there is no script writer in Assistant) and the author does not provide alternative instructions for the same operation in Assisstant. I am muddling my way through and have ordered an Assistant hand book, but I am aggravated because I just spent $32.00 for this one and it's only a little more helpful than the book that came with the program itself!"
2,If you can GET one........,"If you need this book quickly, don't bother. Although the order page says allow 1 to 2 weeks for delivery, mine (which I needed for a graduate class) has been on order for over 7 weeks.On the other hand, IF you can get one, the 6.5 version was very useful in quickly learning ToolBook II Instructor."
2,1000 monkeys with 1000 turntables...,"This album has some great tracks on it, but you may well only like half of this album. Which half depends on your taste. I bought this album after hearing several of the more innovative tracks on this album. Some tracks make me want to throw my iPod under a train.This DJ Kicks outing for Hot Chip is like several of your drunk mates fighting over the music at your house party. Some people may like this dyslexic mix of music, but I'd personally agree that it's a train wreck. Not that it needs to be beat mixed, or eq'd or whatever... but at least a coherent journey of some kind be it emotional or musical. A much better case is made by the back to mine series, say the Orbital or Orb mixes.Overrated? Yep, definitely.2 stars only because there is a couple of really ace tracks.Buy the songs elsewhere, mix it yourself."
4,I mean seriously...,"I have to completely disagree with the 1 star review of this album. This album is NOT a 1-2 star. I am very pleased with the wide variety of styles here and the manner in which they are arranged. As mentioned in the ""formal"" reviews, this collection covers everything from minimalist techno to ""I got a man"" to Ray Charles, who is always a delight to listen to. Very enjoyable. Not to mention, the Hot Chip song ""My Piano"" is great. After the first listen I knew this would only get better as I listened to it more. Anyway, I had to chime in on this album and give it some of the justice it deserves.If you like a wide variety of music and appreciate collections that offer an interesting mix of it, you should find this quite enjoyable."
2,Bad!!!,"This web cam makes annoying chirpy sound when in use, my wife hates it. Thats not all the drivers provided for this don't work for reinstall, I gave up after I accidentally installed chinese version of the software and then I couldn't install the English version of it (it did install, but never worked). I'm using it only as a web cam now, the rest of the features I've trashed."
1,This product sucks,"Everything you see in the product description is not true!First of all the photo resolution is 352x288,which half of the pixels listed on the website.That is not all.There is no headset microfone included like the website says.DO NOT BUY IT."
3,I expected more,So far it has not lowered my blood sugar. I am taking it twice a day for one month .
2,History of United States,"American Heritagene illustrated History of United Sttes has 16 volumes.Once I was on fleemarket and found 8 volumes published by Fawcett Publication Inc,1971 year. I decided to collect additional 8 volumes and make gift to my grandsons. It means I check publisher before making purchase.The same I did now. But when I opened package I was very disappointed. It was Dell publisher Co, issued 1963 year.Now,I lost money and need to buy new.I didn't want to give negative feed back but Amazon website is very complicated and I can't find seller emailDanishevskiy"
5,Christmas miracle,"Okay, each Christmas you try to think of what to buy people who don't need more stuff. But what can everyone always use? Food! I first bought this book for this reason and am buying the update again to find food finds for gifts. I have looked for lost childhood foods often as Christmas gifts from the perfect popcorn ball that is most like my great aunt LeGreta's to Lefse. In this book you can find old favorites and new taste tempters. I know I'm getting real old fashioned ribbon candy as one gift but what else is out there to try? I always end up getting food for myself too, after all, it's my childhood too. This is a great resource for the hard to buy for."
5,Unique must for the foodaphile,"Well categorized which makes it so easy to find -- from chili from Chugwater to cheese from Maytag -- this is one book to aid in finding good ingredients. Wish there was something like this for various major metro areas -- like where to find those tough to get items locally. However, what with the phone and web connections these days, its so quick to get them via ups and fedex. Hats off to the Engels for such a neat find for us food junkies."
5,An Excellent Culinary Excursion!,"Extremely well written survey of various small out-of-the-way artisan specialty food manufacturers around the country. The coversational, yet concise writing style is a pleasure to read. The book is fun to just randomly skim through for ideas. There is a noble emphasis on preservative and additive-free products made with the simplest ingredients. A little historical information about the various purveyors adds human interest. Also, prices are given, which is a rarity in a guide like this. The book reflects considerable research effort on the part of the authors."
5,A great biography of GWH Bush at War,I read this book just after his election loss for a second term; it made the loss all the more sad and poignant - how could a man of this depth of character not be re-elected?
4,Fantastic,"i love this camera, it was much better than i expected! it takes really bad motion pictures though, and because its so small, ur hand shakes sometimes which causes the picture to be blurry, but with 104 possible pictures, its worth the risk. the main upset of the camera is that if the battery runs out all ur pictures in the camera get erased. other than those, its an awesome starter camera. i may be just really mean, but the thing i hate the most about having this camera is that now all my friends want one, and i liked being the only one to have one! its gonna get too bandwagony soon lol"
2,It's a Tiny Camera,"Very cheap. You can't delete pictures off of the camera. You just have to wait for the battery to die and it will automatically delete all of the pictures for you. (Don't worry though, that won't take too long since the battery life is only a few hours). As for picture quality, for the price it was actually quite good... that is until it stops working after only a few months like mine did."
3,good cheap little camera,"not the best but what do you expect for this price,pic are small but look pretty good considerating"
2,Disappointing,"The camera is *much* smaller than I expected. That's fine - I sould have read the product description more closely.But, the camera itself is overall very disappointing. The controls are all handled from one button - which means that you need to sit down with the manual every time you need to do something - that's hardly appropriate for kids.Additionally, it's hard to tell when you've taken a picture - a camera for kids really ought to make a satisfying ""CLICK"" noise. But this doesn't give any indication at all.So, unfortunately, it really seems like the kid who is old enough to use this camera is already old enough to use a regular camera."
4,golf club scrub,This is an excellent product to help keep your clubs clean. It is simple to use. Just spray on and wipe off.
5,Great Sticks,Got them for a friend and he loves them. He uses them every day. Feels good that I can find quality at a great price.
4,Good,Good sticks. Good for the kids to use. They are durable and good quality. Shipment arrived within a reasonable time.
5,Pure Dark Genius,"A recent convert (the last 5-6 years) to jazz, I have fallen in love with the Miles of this period. The music echoes the firing synapses in my head. A lot of ""jazz critics"" get into mood and the method of the Man, but just sit back and let the sounds pull you around. You can really hear where current groups are getting their inspiration (radiohead, death in vegas, mogwai, etc., Check out the organ solo on Death in Vegas' Aisha off their Contino Sessions album, it is the lost child of the organ solo towards the end of disc one.) Miles, always innovative....always the Dark Magus."
5,The best of the post Bitches Brew years,"Coming to Miles via the obvious (Kind of Blue) route, I stumbled on the fusion years almost by accident. What a stumble! This title is an absolute gem. Much has been said about this being the darkest of Miles' works, but I disagree. Yes, it is heavy, but I find it full of energy and brightness. The sound quality on the remastered version is stunning - it could have been recorded at any time in the last thirty years. Above all else, this disc rocks. That pounding, relentless rhythm just takes you over so that you lose yourself - each fifty-minute disc passes in what seems like ten. This is not inaccessible music - if your mind is open you will become fully involved and immersed. One lasting impact of this period of Miles is that it turned me on to the latter Hendrix (Band of Gypsies) stuff that I had previously not really 'got'. What a collaboration that would have been..."
4,Fiery floundering,"Even with some wear burning into the intense tear, DM's propulsion portrays purity- that is if one takes their grooves with a side of grit."
5,Dark Star meets Prince,"Prince, or whatever he calls himself, supposedly lays down some heavy funk at times, but brothers and sisters give this disc a spin and think again. THIS is the Hendrix of Funk- Searing, sexy, and scary. Buckle up and take the journey if you dare..."
4,Very Funky,"This album is very funky,with lots of funky guitar playing and funky grooves.The only thing that disappointed me about this recording was that Miles does not play a lot of trumpet,but when he does it's outstanding."
5,Great for growing minds. A+,"This is a wonderful product for a terrific price! Not only is it BRIGHT and FUN in appearance, it is a durable toy that My 18 month old son and 5 year old daughter are both very excited about... it is so fun to watch their little imaginations run wild with this toy... and after 3 weeks they are still happy to get in the tub and play with it! Which is bragable.. considering most toys dont last past the first day or two until they are buried in the toy box and never thought of again."
2,Disappointed,"Had hopes that our grandson would love playing w/this during bath time. However, the foam pieces would not stick tothe tub wall as advertised."
5,Our best bath toy,"We've had this product for more than a year, and my kids play with it every single bath. They stick them to the wall and to each other (which is fun too), and the pieces are easy to clean, which is not true for a lot of bath toys. My older son only started to be able to put the street together by himself when he turned 3 or so. Before then, I had to help him with it. The only thing I would improve is that the mesh bag it comes in is shaped such that it's difficult for little kids to get the pieces out or put them away. But even with that, it's definitely our favorite bath toy."
4,Great Fun!,"My daughter, almost 2, loves imagination and bath time! This allows her to explore her imagination in the bath! Building roads and then talking about all of the vehicles riding on the roads is so much fun!!!"
3,Cute but get moldy easy,You know that pinkish color mold that sometime accumulates in the corners of the showers when you haven't gotten around to cleaning? I think that this product attracts that stuff.They are adorable but I would not recommend to a friend.
4,Great fun for the bathroom,We were looking for fun bath toys for boys aged 5-7 yrs. These are great. Boys like them a lot!
4,Tub Time Fun,"We bought this for our two little boys (ages 4 and 1-1/2). They love to play with it in the tub. We just give them a few pieces at a time. They easily stick to the side of the tub when wet or float. Cleanup is easy with the mesh bag. It suctions to the side of the tub so it doesn't have to sit on the floor soggy. The mesh bag also allows for quick drying. No more bleaching our old moldy ones! I highly recommend it. Also, the pieces are very colorful and I think girls would enjoy it as well. My 1-1/2 year old doesn't chew the toys buy I wouldn't recommend it for a baby who still mouths objects."
5,Great Toy,"This is an excellent product. One of my concerns was the adhesion, and to my surprise they stick to the sides and walls of the tub perfectly. My sons love this toy and the only drawback was trying to get them out of the tub. Great buy, great product, lots of fun."
4,Great!,We bough this for a little friend of ours and it got here when it said it would which was great because their birthday was coming right up!
2,"A little young for this toy at 2.5 years of age,","It is so difficult finding interesting bath tub toys. So when I discovered this, I jumped at the opportunity to buy it. However, at 2.5 years of age, my son is a little too young to ""get"" the toy. He did begin to chew a few pieces and ruined them. Once he discovered chewing them, I was having a hard time gathering all the pieces before he was putting them in hi moutn. This toy may end up actually being ""ok"" in a year,so, this really isn't a complete review. For now, the toy is put away until he is a little older.. ."
5,Kids loved it,My nephews loved this toy! My sister has said numerous times that the boys play with it all the time in the tub. They are 3 and 4. Great present for them!
5,Excellent Bathtime Entertainment!,Our son adores this set and he loves that he can make the pieces stick to the side of the tub or wall and that he can also construct streets and have them float in the bath water itself.
5,Awesome Starter!,Very pleased with this starter set. I am new to the sport and this is a great way to start the disc golf experience. I know it's just me but i seem to be able to throw the shark(mid-range) farther than the cheetah(driver). With a little practice i'm sure this will change. Thanks for such a great product. :)
3,One set had two putters in it.,"I ordered 4 sets of these and the order was received on time. The problem was that one of the sets had 2 putters in it instead of the driver, midrange, and putter. I did not know who to call regarding this and just let it go because it seemed like more of a hassel to try and get this changed. Otherwise the discs are good."
4,Good purchase for beginners.,"This is a great set for beginning disc golfers to learn how to play the game (sport?). However, if you're no longer a beginner and want something a little more advanced and more fun to play with, look into the Innova champion disc sets."
5,Disc Golf Away!,"This product is exactly as advertised. It came on time, and allowed me to play disc golf through the woods. I'm very new, but the frisbees seemed to work great, and I didn't lose any. Good product."
5,Perfect beginner set,Bought 3 sets for my two sons and myself in order to try out this sport. It's a great and inexpensive way to introduce someone to frisbee golf.
4,Slicing Air Currents Left and Right,These are a great deal. Sure you could go to your local sporting goods store and get second-hands or cast offs for less... but for brand new discs this is probably the lowest price you'll find. Such a great sport sweeping the nation and oftentimes no Greens Fees or golf carts necessary!
5,great starter package,"This is a great starter pack at a good price. I love the free shipping that came with it. If we like disc golf, we might upgrade, but this is fine for now."
5,Innova Disc Golf Standard Set,"Very satisfied with my purchase. The discs are of quality value, and the carring case works well with all the extra pockets for water bottle and cell phone. Very nice product, very quick shipment, and arrived in excelent condidtion."
4,Great package for the price!,"I just recently picked up the game and thought this was a great deal on some decent discs to get going. The shipping was very fast and I took them out right away to the course right away to try them out. These were a little lighter discs than I was expecting, but they seem to be just fine. I'm used to throwing 175+ gram discs and these are more in the 155 gram range. All in all, the bag is nice and the set seems pretty adequate."
1,Not as ordered.,"Like a few others that have purchased this set, I was extremely disappointed that I was shipped the DX set instead of the Champion set. If you care about the discs you are getting, do not order from them, it's not worth the risk. If you just want some discs and don't care which set you receive you might as well save yourself some money and just order the DX set, chances are that is what they will send you anyways."
2,Do not buy this product (I think).,"There's a problem with this item. Amazon has two different listings for the same product. There's an ""Innova 3-disc starter set"" and there this a ""DX starter 3-pack"". The DX starter 3-pack costs a few bucks more (at least when I bought it). But these are actually the same set. Identical. I bought the DX starter set, thinking that by paying about $4 more, I would get slightly better discs. But I got exactly what I would have gotten had I purchased the other one. Partially my fault, I realize. I should have researched it more carefully. But bottom line is that when you're buying, be sure to look at both products before making a decision. (The actual discs themselves, by the way, are fine)."
2,"OK discs, but not quite as described.","First, the discs pictured are Ken Climo signature chapionship discs, the ones recieved were not. In fact, I'm pretty sure when I ordered the discs, the title even said ""Ken Climo Signature Championship Discs"" or something to that effect. No big deal, as I'm sure the discs are the same, just without the signature. Furthermore, my girlfriend orderd a set of discs the same day as me, but got them 7 days sooner! I checked on the order daily, and it took 4 or 5 days before the discs were even shipped, yet the item was listed as ""in stock."" Overall, I think the compnay that sold the discs, ""Sun King Enterprises"" is one to stay away from. Get your discs from someone else!"
3,A Sampler for Everyone,"About what you would expect from a sampler CD. The tracks range from OK to outstanding. As a big Maynard Ferguson fan, I purchased it for the MF track which is good, but track 3: The Real Blues by The Ray Brown Trio is currently my favorite ""demo"" track for my new speakers (Gallo Reference 3 and A'Diva Titanium surrounds). The texture of the bass solos that start and end the track are incredible. You may find a new favorite on this disc and it is a great way to audition a dozen SACDs."
5,Great Sounding SACD,This is awsome deal. Nice ecclectic selection of songs. Super price. This SACD really gave my system a workout and showcased its capabilities.
2,nice sound but...,"Sound's good, many songs are good but many of them boring, not my style of listening music, not a good choice for me..."
3,My kids loved it......me? not so much,"It's a great IDEA, but they didnt really hit the nail on the head. The paint doesnt stick to the stamps, so you sort of get colored watery blobs wherever you attempt to make a stamp. It might work better if my kids didnt get so much water in it, but it IS a bath toy, right? My kids also wanted to basically use ALL the paints - like in ONE bath! My one daughter did get a little irritation on her bottom, but there was a LOT of paint in their bath! I also have no idea where to get refills of just paint? Since our paint is gone, we now have stamps and brushes with no purpose. I probably Will end up buying more though.I think those other reviews are seriously for some other product. This item was NOT a make-it-yourself bath sachet kit??? And you definitely would not have girls at a slumber party all taking a bath together! Definitely wrong item."
1,Unhappy child!,"Bath time is my son's favorite part of the day. This product actully made him throw a tantrum because he was so frustrated. Something I've never seen during bath time or art time! Basically the paint doesn't adhere to any surface that is wet. The sponges work if the parent carfully applies the paint straight from the tube and the presses it on part of the bath that hasn't gotten wet. However, my three year old son could only get a blob of color if anything at all. I would take this product back, but it was given to us by a family member. I think I'm going to put it in the arts and crafts area away from the bath. I'm sure it will work better away from the water. This is the first review I've ever written. I wanted to share my experience so others can save thier money."
1,Deep disappointment,I was very disappointed with the quality of this product. I had to request a second kit because the scented oils bottles were empty in the first kit. The second kit also had the same problem. Both kits had to be returned. It is difficult to determine how fun this kit would be when it is missing items within the kit.
1,Huge waste of money,"This product is absolutely useless. The ""Paint"" is so thin it does not work as advertised. You cannot write with it on the body or the walls. Complete waste of money."
1,Turned My Son GREEN!,"I painted with my two year old son and he had a great time painting his tummy and legs and the bathtub. When it was time to get out of the tub I could wash off the bubbles off my son but not the color. My son is now green. Lovely. It did come off of the marble for which I'm extremely grateful.As for the product, don't get the sponges in the bath water and the paint sticks much better. I would not recommend this for anyone whose child wants to paint masterpieces, but just for rolling and making a mess, it's wonderful. Well, wonderful as long as picture day isn't coming up."
1,Not worth it!!!,"There is very little paint in each bottle so the whole set could easily be used in one bathtub time. If the brushes or stamps are wet at all, the paint does not work. Not sure how to keep the brushes and stamps from getting wet in the bathtub!!!!! AND the paint does not easily wash off....at least it didn't in my tub. I would DEFINITELY not use this in a tub with tile and grout...what a nightmare!This is a good idea in theory, but this product needs a lot of work!!!!"
2,Not a good buy.,My 5 yr old loved getting this. It looks so cool. But when you take it out of the box the disappointment starts. The paints are runny and diluted. The roller is fun but you cant discern any of the 'masterpieces' because the colors dont adhere to the wall and only run down like drips of colored water. And the foam 'stamps' are a joke. You have to be very delicate to get any sort of picture from them and whose 5 yr old can be delicate? Not mine. She was almost in tears when all she could produce was colored blobs and not the pretty shapes the stamp promised.I will not buy this again. My little artist was better off with the soap crayons.
1,worthless,"I unfortunately bought a Dolphin when the people at Leslie's recommended it. It is worthless. If you have even a small amount of debris - leaves,sticks, ect - in your pool, this thing will suck it up, get clogged, and then go back and forth over the same small area in your deep end for 6 hours. Even if you don't have debris, it will pretty much do the same thing. I tried multiple things recommended by their tech support that did nothing for it. The motor is way too weak to power this thing effectively. Poor design. I hate this product."
2,NOT spiral bound,"I sent a link to this book to my daughter after she asked for a suggestion for a Christmas gift for me. I had bought the larger 1001 puzzle NYT book. I love it, but it is so large and bulky that is it limited as to where I can use it. I was looking forward to this simply because it was advertised as spiral bound. However, the book I received was NOT spiral bound. Never would I have found it worth its price had I known it was not spiral bound and would not lie flat. (And yes, the book was from Amazon, bought through this link, as it was delivered to my house.)"
2,Don't like the binding,"The puzzles themselves are great...but I didn't notice it was spiral bound, and it's a real pain to work in."
1,NOT spiral bound (another complaint),"It's the NYT daily crossword so you know what to expect.BUT, it is NOT spiral bound which makes it a little inconvenient to do the left side unless you sit at a table. Bad but not terrible. What gives this a 1 star from me is that you can actually see where the manufacturer scanned a spiral bound edition to compile this one - you can see the black marks from the spiral wire on the left side of the page. Keeping the costs down is fine but don't produce sloppy imitations and pawn it off as the original."
2,not very many crosswords,"I was disappointed in this book because it is very very thin and only has a few crosswords in it. If you want a thick spiral bound crossword book, I am afraid that you will be disappointed in thequality of the paper and the very few pages."
4,Crossword Puzzles,This NYT crossword puzzle book was given as a Christmas gift and was really enjoyed.
2,Runs way small,I had to return this item. It took forever to get to me via mail. It fit way too small and I didnt like the way the head fit. I guess my dogs just wasnt meant to be a pig!
1,Cleans well whenever you can get it to work,"Yes indeed. I have now had this for 2 years and I've never had it clean the pool more than 3 times without having to send it back. I've had the entire unit, or parts of it back there 6 times now! Even though it is UL listed as weather proof, it's NOT! Customer service Quote ""You didn't leave it out in the rain did you?"" UMMMMM..yes?? I then told them that if it truely wasn't weatherproof, then I was going to send a letter to Underwriter's Labs and tell them such. So they just keep fixing it or sending a new power supply. I've even had the unit returned dead after a claim of a 3 hour test. I'm totally frustrated with this product"
4,Floodland,The name of the book I'm reviewing is Floodland. The author of this book is Marcus Sedwick. It is about a girl named Zoe Black. The sea keeps rising until the city of Norwich turns into an island. The city was crumbling. Zoe gets left behind on the island when her parents go ahead to the mainland. She finds a row boat and goes out to look for her parents. She gets abducted by a warrish gang called the Eels. Zoe spends some time on the island until another gang attacks. The leader a boy named Dooby takes the boat and Zoe. Dooby gets into a fight with a kid named Spat. Then a kid named Munchkin gets in and they row off into the ocean. I would recommend this to a friend because it is a good action book.
2,Alice in Floodland,"RE: AUDIO CASSETTE VERSION. When I began, I didn't realize that this story was written for pre-adult audiences. That accounts for the fact that the savage violence occuring all around is only alluded to, never described realistically (...). While such restraint is entirely appropriate for younger readers, I cannot imagine that the slow pace and off-stage action prove very satisfying to the target audience. The story itself is a post-apocalyptic take on Alice Through the Looking Glass/Dorothy in Oz searching for a way home, but without any of the humor, whimsey or enchantment of those models. The premise is intriguing but a much lighter touch is needed to entertain young readers, either that or a much harder edge for adults."
2,"Great, but Kindle version is very hard to read","This is one of my favorites of Parker's Spenser books, with a lot of Spenser's personal life and personality coming through -- it really brings Spenser's personality to the forefront, testing him through his relationship with Susan. If you're a fan of the regular characters (Hawk, Paul, Susan) this is a good one for that, plus a great story underneath.*But* do yourself a favor and don't get the Kindle version. It is rife with errors, particularly a very annoying type where multiple paragraphs get put together, eliminating a line break. When this happens in the middle of unattributed dialog (over a dozen times before I stopped counting) it stops the story cold while you figure out who is saying what. That's why I had to rate this excellent story a mere two stars. Get the dead tree version instead, you won't be sorry."
2,Boring,"Perhaps I am in the minority of readers when it comes to the Spenser novels by this writer. They are consistently lacking in a deep plot as well as character development. Spenser is nowhere near the characters that have been developed by Connelly or Kellerman, not to mention Coben. There is a richness in the work of these writers that is sorely missing in reading one of the books by Parker. They are harmless and truly mediocre."
3,Spenser Not At His Best,"I rated this a ""3"" just because it was a Parker book, which I will always read at least once - this will be one of those. The story didn't have a lot of the Hawk-Spenser-Susan relationship entertainment which makes most of the books interesting. If you like Robert B. Parker books and you like Spenser read - at least once."
5,For original series lovers,This book is good only if you love the original series. It is an extrapolation of the original concepts and it is very unique. I already knew this book in a very previous edition and this one lets nothing in debt for the late one. I recommend.
3,The Technical Manual is an OK guide to TOS technology,"Considered to be the most famous Star Trek Technical Guide, I am not impressed with it. The main problem with this book is with the absence of color. Instead, the drawings are shaded with lots of confusing dots. Also, only the Class 1 Heavy Cruiser was ever seen, of which only about 13 ever existed, unlike the about 300 it listed. An ""offensive Ray Gun"" was never shown in the original series, either."
3,Standard Fare,"When this work first came out it was a gift for Star Trek fans, but it has grown considerably longer in tooth since that time."
4,Star Trek Starfleet Technical Manual,A wonderful Star Trek fan-fiction writers bible. Everything and anything you wanted to know about Starfleet and the Federation - but was embarrased to ask - is here.
1,Lousy Recording quality,"This recording is a live recording, sounds like it was done in a sewer pipe. Awful sound quality, like those old bootleg Grateful Dead tapes. Lots of great songs, but lousy recording."
5,Good stories read live.,"I liked the stories, they are read to a live audience, which is nice (authentic laughs). Each story is read by a different actor, some better than others.Note that actors transition from loud to soft for dramatic effect, unlike the usual monotone of a standard reader. I dislike as I travel in a car with variable background noise that makes me turn the volume way up for soft parts and then be blasted by the actors' emphasis of a joke, as this isn't a problem for most people's listening I still give this 5 stars."
1,Horror of horrors,"Save your money. This book is NOT funny, the writer needs to get a REAL sense of humor and leave true humor stories to those who can write it. It was a real waste of my money. If I could rate this book below one,that would be my rating. I've heard of dark humor before, but this is beyond that! I trashed it."
5,The Best Book I Have Ever Read!,"I thought it was so sweet how Carrie and keith became great friends. I learned more about Cancer. The book really touched me, and once I started it I couldn't put it down!"
5,WOW!!,As I sit here I have just finished the book not 10 minutes ago. My face is still tear stained. The book shook me to the core and mand me cry MANY times and is the best book i have ever read. The whole book tought me so much and opened my eyes. My dad has always told me 'the worst thing in the world for a parent to do is bury a child' and this book made me leave my room crying and hug my mom. Its so undiscribeable how this book touched me and how it made the think. This book is something every person should read adults and teens alike.
4,Handicap helper,I bought this for my wife to help her with therapy. She is handicapped and insurance will only go so far for physical therapy. It helps her to stretch and work the muscles in the most beneficial way to get stronger on her own. Very good book.
4,review,"Greatbook for the everyday person. For a therapist, it lacks in-dept description of pathologies. But the book does mention this. For the eveyday user, it is a wonderful book that describes some of the major pathologies (injuries) and how to deal with them through exercise."
3,The American Physical Therapy Association Book of Body Maintenance,This has some excellent exercises in it and really good information. I am using some of them for my back and neck problems.
2,disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this poster. I have purchased a real poster that looked the same online and it was great. This, however, is a photocopy of a poster and doesn't even capture all of the printing...it's cut off on one side! I looked again at the listing, and it WAS just as pictured..I just did not notice it in the listing. I bought this to frame and resell in our Harvey House..doubt that it will sell :("
4,GreaT Collection of Wonderful Stories!,"I really liked this book. It is a little different from what I normally read, but I am so glad that it finally found its way to the top of the ""waiting pile"".The book is a collection of short stories. Stories full of drama and tragedy, stories of exiles and fugitives, stories of hunger and misery, stories of foreigners and strangers. Yet, it is also the life story of two women, and of their two mysterious companions... Lola and Petroushka, and once you begin reading, you will find it hard to stop.So, give it a chance, I assure you that you will find yourself wrapped around the surreal but highly believable world of Elena Garro."
4,Still relevant and Rockin',"I got this CD in the mid-90s and still love it. It has all the elements of a hard rocking band, complete with driving guitar riffs and clever lyrics."
1,Not Worth The Money,"While the transducer itself works perfectly fine while your boat is sitting still, if you ever contact anything in the water that causes it to kick up, you'll never be able to run at high speed again without it kicking up. When it does, you'll have no idea of the depth of water you're running in. I have a fairly slow, aluminum fishing boat (about 42 mph, top speed) and even without contacting a stump, log, grass or even the lake or river bottom, just the water pressure generated at top speed eventually caused my transducer to kick up. After I got tired of laying over the transom of the boat and reaching my arm down into the water to reset the transducer, I ordered a factory replacement. Nine fishing trips later, my new transducer had the same problem. I've now replaced it with a transom mount that does not kick up and I've had no further problem. I do not recommend this particular transducer with the kick up feature."
1,Temperature sensor defective,"Ordered this transducer as a replacement for my PirhanaMax 215 because the original got torn off (I think someone may have stepped on it while trying to re-enter my boat using the ladder nearby). Paid the extra $4 to get the proper unit with the temperature sensor but once connected the display always reads 99 degrees. Tried calling Humminbird technical support - no help. Cannot exchange with Amazon, only option is refund. I would try to order another but now the price has been increased by $8. I'll be looking around for somewhere else to order from."
5,Quick and effective replacement,"I scraped up the original transducer for my Piranha Max 160 dragging my zodiac on shore too many times before I made transom wheels for it. Screen showed nothing but a bunch of random lines and fish. But once I swapped it with my new one everything works perfect again! I didn't even have to screw on the new mounting bracket as it fit in the original one, saved putting any extra holes in the transom. Ironically I didn't catch any fish the first time out after replacing it."
1,Good product just bad customer service from Amazon.,"The brand new transducer Amazon sent to me has a problem with the temp sensor. I contacted Humminbird and after just a few moments they determined it was defective. After I notified Amazon of the problem they wanted me to send the transducer back to them and they would send me another one. For the average person that might be alright, but I fish almost everyday. I have been without my fish-finder for two weeks and I am not going to be without it any more. Since the problem is their fault I feel they should send me a replacement and I will send them back the defective one. Based on this experience I feel that Amazon is not customer oriented and does not trust anyone to do the right thing. I am very satified with Humminbird and their equipment but I will not use Amazon anymore and will do all I can to make sure everyone knows how I feel."
1,Worse book I ever read ! I would give it a minus 1 star.,"In the first 5 pages, Kate saves Roy from a mugging, lets him think she is gay and finds out the office staff also thinks that. The decides she is missing out on life of course make up an adjustment to her clothes and Roy thinks she is pretty. Roy is a former football player who never wanted to play did it for his father. With an injury now has to start over in another business and needs help. This book had too much of every romance novel, ulgy duckling, invalid parent, injuries,over-achievement. Not a strong charactor among the lot. Sorry I wasted the money on this one."
4,More of the same.,"""Momma and the meaning of life"" is definately worth reading. As in his other books, Dr. Yalom articulately exposes his sometimes not so PC thoughts in order to illustrate his existential style of therapy. His stories are enlightening and create such empathy for his characters. However, if you haven't read ""When Nietzsche Wept"" or ""Love's Executioner"" you should start with those two books."
3,sweet & sour,"Momma and the Meaning of Life has some great stories. Unfortunately it also has some less great ones. Yalom shares interesting insights about his relationship with his mother and, as always, demonstrates well the advantages of self awareness in therapy. There are a couple fictional stories that while not horrific are not, in my opinion, as good as the rest of his work and sorta throw the book a bit off balance as a whole."
5,Momma and the meaning of life,"This is a great book. As a therapist myself, I loved the candid exploration of client and therapist experiences during the theraputic process. I loved Love's Executioner, but this one is even more captivating. Ivan is older, more mature, and even more honest with himself, than ever before. I could not put this book down!"
3,Momma and the Meaning of Life,"This is the first book by Yalom I have read, and I really enjoyed his non-fiction stories about his encounters with patients. He made me wish I could find a therapist like him myself, even though I wasn't considering therapy. But I didn't enjoy his fiction stories at all. (one problem was my copy is missing page 200, so I never got to read the end of ""Double Exposure""). I prefer his stories where he reveals himself along with the patients, and this is missing in the fiction stories. I prefer true stories as much as possible. Still, I am looking forward to reading his other books."
4,So far so good,Reading it for a class - only halfway into it but you have to love Yalom's candor. As a grad student in counseling I appreciate the glimpse into his thoughts.
5,worked great,The old heat sink must of had a bad fan. Put this new one on and the CPU temp dropped 20C. Delivery was on time. Great service!
3,Does its thing but very loud,"This relatively low profile (for its class) fan/heatsink does what it's supposed to very well on my 2.93ghz Celeron mod machine, but it is loud to the point of distraction. (I can easily hear it 20+ft away & down the hall.) I wish I knew the db specs on it because I would have a great gauge on what to look out for in the future.If you can live with the noise and are still working with socket 478, it's a very standard & no pain install, and it'll do what you need. Otherwise, it might be best to look elsewhere.Rated four because I don't have great airflow in my mod machine but this fan/heatsink does its thing anyways. Rated two (I'm being nice actually) for the noise. The final Three rating is an average."
5,2 thumbs up,Pleasure to deal with. Knows what customer service is and how to go the extra mile for a customer.
1,be careful of dvd not multi zoned !!!!!,TERRIBLE. DVD's not playable in a dvd player that cannot be multi zoned !!!! now have all seasons but cannot play them. Would have been good to know this before hand......What a waste......
1,Not far from the (post) Soviet dream,"In the early post-Soviet Russia one of the top dream jobs for girls was to become a sex therapist. Across the ocean grandpa Heff dedicated his whole life to make sure there is a steady supply and demand for what is believed to be ""the oldest profession in the world"". Thus, in our post-communist reality the two standpoints wonderfully met inside the house of our brave pimping grandpa.Can't give it five stars because I'm not sure if silicone and all the other stuff pumped into the girls' bodies is gonna be healthy for them in the end. And it may affect their pretty blond brains, too."
1,"An old master, but not for Kendle","I have used a number of concordances and of course, Cruden's is one of them. I bought this concordance thinking that by using Kendal's search feature, I could find words and cross reference them to the King James Bible. It was a good thought but did not prove workable. Whenever I looked up a word that returned more than two pages of word ""hits"" my Kendal would lock-up. it did this no less than six times.The only way, it seems, to access words in this concordance is to go through it one page at a time.This is not the type of product that I want on my Kendal so I have deleted my copy."
1,Unusable - OCR Garbage or shoud I say G/Erba8e ?,"The product description lies.""This IS NOT an OCR'd book with strange characters""It's LOADED with jumbled words.Kinct Solomou?Gospel of Lute?Prophet Klijah?Not worth the time it would take to download if it was free.Avoid."
1,Simply Awful!!!,I thought perhaps the first two reviews were overdone- they were not. This is simply the worst thing I've ever received- It locked my Kindle on the very first search. I've deleted it already. Kindle needs to get a good concordance like Strongs-- didn't see any alternatives in the store but don't waste your time downloading this one.
4,Best for Brother,"I totally disagree with Vee. I have used several different brands of paper in my MFC-465CN printer and none of the photo prints were acceptable at all. I have found that when you are using Brother ink (LC51 series in my case) you have to use their paper also. I have probably owned printers from all the major manufacturers through the years, and it is my opinion that this combination of Brother paper and ink creates the best photos. It is true that the paper is a little flimsy but I haven't needed the heavier stock for anything specific."
5,We re-live this 2006 concert in Austin with this!,"I was at this concert in Austin, October 2006. It was fabulous, outside at Zilker Park. October was perfect with the breezes and trees swaying in the background while the Stones took the stage and the crowd by storm. As only they can do. Get this DVD...if you were at the concert, you will remember it by re-living it. If you were not there, watching this really loud is a good simulation of being there! It is great and so fun to see the Stones rockin' hard in their 60s!"
4,Just one,I've been disapointed because i already have the Stones on DVD with three shows and when i saw this blue ray thereis only the Atlantic city gig.
1,Product Arrived Damaged,I'm giving this one star as the Blu Ray arrived damaged. Already had thrown out all of the paperwork - so I can't watch the first few songs. #Frustrating!
4,"Great to see the Stones, 5.1 is very good","I enjoy the Stones and ANY DVD of them is worth owing and watching. For 2007, the 5.1 audio is good but not as good as compared to the 2009 digital remaster of ""Live at the Max""). The filming was great, high quality, The Stones as usual played great engergetic shows, no complaints. I just wish using 6 speakers they would have re-mixed the songs for better separation, it sounds almost like a straight to video sound board recording, but is still good to listen too."
1,Great software but can't recommend it.,This is the best photo software for home users but I found two major drawbacks:a)For first time users only basic information is provided. Adobe includes a barebones manual with just the minimum information to get you started .If you want to learn how to use this program be prepared to fork out extra cash to buy a book to learn how to use it or spend a lot of time searching in help menu.b)For users of previous versions I don't find enough enhancements to justify the upgrade.
1,"Unstable, irritating software - Think twice before buying for the mac!","This software crashes almost everytime it's opened. Move too fast, try to print, open a document, it doesn't matter - it ""closes unexpectedly."" Has lots of cool capabilities when it works, but be prepared to open it over and over and over and over again before you finish a project!!Running on Mac OX X Version 10.4.7"
3,not much better,"adobe PSE 3 not the best but the best program is PS CS2 , anyway this is goodstart by using this program."
1,Older is better,"Adobe made things worse with Photoshop Elements 3. Photoshop Elements 2 is a wonderful program and is far superior to Version 3. If you have Version 2, it's a waste of money to upgrade as you lose the ability to do some things in Version 3."
3,first use of Elements,"I bought this for my Tiger - but it isn't an upgrade. It was required by a Digital Imaging class. I think it's hard to learn - once I had Photoshop LE for my 8.6 Centris and I loved it - I set up an entire web site and product catalog with it.But this one is so different, I am struggling with all the little layers, etc. the instructor - who OF COURSE - only uses a PC - lives and breathes Elements - so guess it is good software"
2,A waste of upgrade dollars for Mac users,"If you already have version 2 of Photoshop Elements, don't waste your money upgrading to version 3 unless you want to pay the full amount to use a healing brush insted of the cloning stamp.Most of the new functionality is geared towards Windows users with the new Organizer and its cataloging, scrapbooking, cards, and calendars features. The Organizer is NOT available to Mac users. Photoshop Elements remains great software for digital darkroom work, but Adobe has elected to leave Mac users out in the cold with respect to providing tools to easily do something creative with the pictures once they have been digitally processed."
3,"Good upgrade, but not great","If you have Photoshop Elements 2.0 for Mac, you probably should just keep it. Version 3 adds little in terms of functionality, but changes a lot of things just for the sake of being different. Unfortuately being different means it tries to look more like a Windows Program and less like Mac one.I would recommend getting the newest version of iPhoto over this"
1,Does not faithfully pass all keys to operating system,"I like to use capslock as a modifier key. With a USB keyboard directly connected to the machine, this works fine. However, going through the PS/2 adapter, caps-lock-as-modifier-key only works until the first keyup. So, say you press caps-lock + f (meaning in this case, alt + f). The operating system will see caps-lock+f. Then you release f and press g. The operating system then just sees a plain 'g' where it should have sees caps lock + g.I can't use it like this."
5,Love these period!,"These adapters ALWAYS work. Bought some cheaper adapters and it's a risk if they work and continue to work as time goes on. These are a bit more expensive but always, always, always work."
1,Not for ASUS Maximus Gene IV motherboards,"Seems some motherboards simply won't accept keyboard ps/2 to usb adapters. My MB is one of them, so I can't use my IBM M keyboard with the trackpoint, I have to use a separate mouse if I want to use my beloved keyboard."
1,Deceptive Advertising,"The Manual for Romeo and Juliet is not at all what it is advertised to be. It does NOT contain the original text of the play nor any ""translation"" of the play into modern English. It contains only brief summaries of the play's scenes and a modicum of analysis. If that is what you need, buy Cliff Notes for half the price."
1,Hearing aid batteries,Batteries appeared to be old and had very little life in them. Only lasted 2 to 3 days. I would not recommend batteries from this supplier.
5,"Beautiful, gracious music in wonderful performances","I have to be honest, I am not a big fan of the flute. I LOVE Telemann, but I have never enjoyed the flute as much as I enjoy the recorder, oboe, even clarinet or bassoon. I bought this set of discs because of the music and because I think MDG are currently the most adventurous and significant of today's classical record companies. The set also made great claims for the flute player and the particular instrument he plays. They were right: I was wrong. This is a wonderful recording which has given me hours of great pleasure. Telemann is at his most graceful and the soloist is gentle and beguiling on the ear. His colleagues are equally outstanding, and I include here the technical staff who set down the tracks. I am so glad I made this purchase. Highly recommended."
4,good but a liitle off,"got these sticks a few weeks ago and they have great powerful sound nice grip and seem to play better for me, but no matter were i hold them i cant seem to find a good balance in the stick."
2,not a great set of tools,rolling pin doesn't roll like a real rolling pin.red tool is not useful.a real rolling pin and plastic knife from home would be better.
4,dough tools,they work fine. i got them for my grand . which was yesterday. she is 4 yrs olddaughter for her birthday
5,Play Dough Fun,My Grandchildren loved these play dough tools. They are too young to use knives or anything else to trim the dough.These plastic tools are perfect. Grandma had fun playing with them also!
5,Lots of Fun!,My grandchildren play with these playdoh tools every time they come see Nana! These are not cheaply made. I highly recommend the dough tools.
3,beware rolling pin,"This set of tools is great overall. However, the rolling pin is one piece -- not like a real rolling pin where the roller and the handles move separately."
3,Rolling Pin not 'true' Rolling,"Good, sturdy plastic tools for Playdoh - but the description of the Rolling Pin should really detail out that it does NOT roll..."
4,Pretty good!,"I bought these for my daughter and my nephew, a package for each of them. They are effective and interesting for these Just-3 and Almost-3 year olds. They like the patterns they make and have used them each time they play with the play dough. I would say that if you're working on a delicate surface, like one that scratches easily (like a finish on a kitchen table) it is likely you will get scratches. For us, it ""builds character"" into the table, and it isn't REALLY damaging like a gouge or a chip, but definately some scratches with sharp corners of the tools, specifically the little spackle-looking tool and the 'serrated' knife."
2,"Cube is nice, stand is terrible","The cube is solid and looks great. However, the stand is a cheap piece of junk. The light didn't even work and it is flimsy plastic. If you purchase, forget the stand."
1,Horrible,This product is terrible it took abot 3 months to arrive. I was supper thrilled it would be here a week before my moms bray but no it was here 3 months AFTER
1,Not worth the money,"I didn't like how it looked. The picture was a lot different then the product. I wouldn't buy this again. This year i went with: ""Mother I Cherish You"" Heartwarming 8x10 Quotes About Mothers, Double-matted in Ruby Red/white and Surrounded with Real Flower Photographyand my mother loved it"
3,Glass Collectable.,"Didn't expect this item to be as small as it is. It's cute, but SMALL. It doesn't come with batteries, so make sure you buy THREE of them so this thing will work for you.."
1,"Ordered this item , but was sent a set of screw drivers 10-04-2010","I would love to rate thi item. I ordered it for my mother's birthday, however, she recieved a set of screwdrivers from ""Furniture Creations"". I've emailed FC, but her birthday has passed and she didn't get anything from me."
5,Love You Mom,"When I opened the box, this was truly a wonderful piece. A perfect gift for any son to give his mom."
3,For mother,Was nice is &ours was what I expected got something like Thia for her before but different its cool changes colors and she loved it.
2,"The word ""Inaccurate"" should be in the title","As someone who has first hand knowledge, this book is riddled with inaccuracies. From who did what to what was done, the errors are both big and small. Most of the information gathered was third hand. The ""personal"" innuendo included is insulting. It's amazing this book was published."
5,Not Only Great for Fans,"I've never played the game, but I sure do want to now. Very rich story, good graphics for its time."
4,This is a great smart media card,"I got one of these for my nomad II and it hold about 30min of music. it records easly and is very rugged. I've droped it , sat on it and it has never broken or got damaged. I love these egde cards because there reliable and inexpensive.i recommend buying one."
3,interesting but largely academic,The characters in this book are confused. The characters in this book are confused. And they are embarrassed by their Jewish parents.Too bad the characters in this book aren't very exciting. These characters make the Thirtysomething gang seem fun by comparison.Still maybe his next book will be better.
5,"Great accordian ""toy""","I don't know that this really falls into the category of ""toy"" because the thing is awesome as a working accordian, albeit a kids version. The sound is great--strong and clear. It comes with tips on how to play the instrument as well as some tunes that are really quite easy to learn and fun to practice. It is educational not only to learn finger placement on the correct keys but to pull and push at the proper times. The only caveat is that it is a little tuff to pull for younger kids. And, there is no numbering on the keys themselves though we just took a Sharpie and wrote them on ours. Bottomline: a great instrument for kids to dabble with and well worth the cost (I'm actually surprised it didn't cost more)."
5,Schylling Accordion,My Grandson had one and my Grandaughter loved it. So for her birthday I surprised her with the exact same accordion. She was so excited! Couldn't find one anywhere so went on line and found it. The price was great and sound is beautiful.
4,good brain trainer,"Nice gift given to my friend's 3 year old daughter. I was a little concerned at first because the bellows were rather stiff requiring a bit of strength to produce sound.She loved it! I got her twin 3 year old sister a piano flute and they both were parading around the x-mas tree with big smiles. Mom and dad weren't so annoyed as the sounds complimented well. The accordion is diatonic - sounds are within a strict range.(no sour notes)Built with good enough quality to stay intact throughout the holiday season. However, 2 months later a button fell out, introducing the noted ""choking hazard"". No big deal for these 3 year olds, though."
5,"im too old to be enjoying this, this much.","I found this toy in a local Homegoods store, and was having a blast playing it in the store. I'm so happy to find the same product online because the one in the store had been damaged. It really sounds like an accordion, the air really comes in and out of it and it has to have the air inside of it in order to play the sounds, not your usual childs toy. Oh and i'm 22 years old, and i'm buying it for myself. My niece can play with it when she comes over..MAYBE."
2,well - it's a toy not a miniature instrument,"I bought this for my 3 year old nephew. It makes noise, but doesn't have enough wind to create a basic song. It's too short. Probably more of a head ache for the parents, though I am not sure. My nephew seemed disappointed that we couldn't at least play some basic nursery rhymes/songs on it. I know I was."
3,Great idea but too difficult to play with it,"I saw this toy on cragslist first by chance and I really like it.I placed an order at once from amazon.First impression was really good. Especially, I really like the deep sound.Playing it, I found that this is too difficult for kids to play.As you know accordion is operated by air flow but it is too hard even to adult.So if you want your kids to know what the accordion is, it is ok.But for education? I don't think so."
1,Ordered it twice and the WRONG one keeps coming!!,"I have ordered this item twice now. Both times I received the blue Hohner accordian instead of this one. AND, the hohner is about $18, I paid $28.95 each for the two supposedly red Schylling kids accordians that I've been trying to order. I kindly explained this to Amazon and they said don't order it again because the same blue Hohner will be sent again. I commented that they should take this off the site because it's going to continue to happen to other people. But, it's still here. So, I figured I'd give the consumers a fair warning. In addition, I'm sending both Hohner's back. The reviews aren't very good. Hope this helps."
2,"Great toy, sad on the condition.","I recieved this for my son, i was told that it was next to new. In the picture it looked great. We recieved it in a timley manner (10 days earlier than expected, so thank you for that), when we opened the pkg we were very sad!! The box was written 4.99 on it, the accordian was BROKEN! It played but it was missing the strap to go over the had to hold on to to even play.The area where the sound/air comes out was torn. If i would of known the Condition, i would never of made this purchace. Shame on you."
5,Excellent Reading!!,This book has great information especially for the new bird owner. I would highly recommend reading it to anyone who is even just thinking of getting an African Grey! It gives alot of insight into things a first time bird owner might not think about ahead of time.
2,Too basic - would have been more helpful if I purchased it before I got my African grey parrot,"The book is full of good information; however, it is too basic. I've had my African grey parrot since July and she is growing up and expressing an array of behaviors. I was looking for a book with much more detail to help me better understand her new behavior and how to address her bad behavior.If I had purchased/read this book before getting my African grey parrot - I would have rated it higher because it has very helpful information regarding the basics and if an African grey is right for you. An even better book which has much more detailed information (good for purchase before or after you obtain your grey)compared to this book is ""African Grey Parrots: Everything about History, Care, Nutrition, Handling, and Behavior"" by Maggie Wright. I own the Maggie Wright book and think it is much better than this book."
5,Great Slow-Cooker Cookbook,This was my first slow-cooker cookbook and it's better than the newer ones that I've received since then. There are plenty of photos for those who need pictures with their recipes. I have marked about 30 must try dishes already from this book because they all look so easy and appetizing at the same time! And I'm hardly through it! This will definitely be an asset in our kitchen for years to come!
2,Not what I was looking for,I wanted finished room design ideas from the show. It's mostly photographs of the steps before the finished project. It might be helpful to someone who wants to do the construction of a building.
5,Fantastic book,"Extreme Makeover Home Edition, a great show, now has a companion book for the first two seasons. I am fortunate enough to own it. I just hope that the rest of the seasons are released, so that I can get those as well. Amazon is a fantastic place to obtain, just about, anything that you want or need."
1,Don't waste your hard earned dollar!,"I bought this fry maker, got it in the kitchen and first of all the suction cups wouldn't stick to my counter. No matter what I did they wouldn't stick. I went ahead and tried to cut my first potato. It wouldn't take any of the potatoes I had, they were too big! But I wouldn't call them big, they were really quite small and I had to cut them in half. Of course then steak fries were out of the question. I put the piece in and tried to push it through with the handle and the whole mechanism kind've melted down in to a crushed piece of worthless junk. Listen... I'm not a rocket scientist, but making french fries shouldn't take much know how! And I'm not a brut either, so it wasn't my enormous strength that made this piece of junk crumble! Save your money, and get one that works."
4,Great but needs something...,This product works great except for the suction cup on the bottom of the cutter. This suction cup does not hold the cutter down on the counter like it is supposed to. I think they should come up with a stronger suction cup or a new way to keep the device on the counter for smooth cutting!
4,very handy little tool,"This machine is great, seems to stick great to the table or counter and is very sturdy. With a quick movement it goes through the potatoe with little problem. You cant use very long potatoes and that is the only thing I would change. I am very satisfied with this product"
2,Dull & Boring,I found this book to be extremely dull and boring! It was written by someone whose primary language was not English. One had to read some paragraphs 3 times and still was not sure what they meant to say. The paintings were not too great either.
2,Macally Battery Life Really Disappoints,"This is a very nicely designed mouse. However, as any iMac user knows, you have very few usb ports and this will take up one of them. That's not the problem; the problem is that the battery life (rechargeable too) is horrible. I mean, you're lucky if you get 3hrs without having to switch it out. What that means is opening the mouse and transmitter (which serves as the charger) covers and switching them around. It may not sound like a big thing until you have to do it 3x times in one day. Even if you do remember to turn the power off there is no guarantee that you will save power. And if you have kids using the computer-forget about it!! I'm back to a wired mouse. I don't have the patience for this type of effort."
4,Nice Mouse,I have used a few wireless mice in the past and I like the feel of this one much more then others I have tried. The only complaint I would have would be the short battery life.
2,These elbows leak around the end that tightens,I purchased 5 of these and 2 of the 5 leak around the end that you tighten. It appears that the ends on these 2 have seperated.
4,Great ....BUT,Pros: Great design (award winning I believe)...Light Weight...USB powered..great to carry with your Laptop...I received a follow up email from the CEO to check how I felt about the product which was a nice touch.Cons: I mainly bought the speakers to use with my laptop while giving various presentations. Yet the speakers' volume was not loud enough to support my presentations. It would have been nice if the speakers had a volume control of their own allowing it to boost the volume. JLAB mentioned that the speakers are mainly meant to be used with winamp etc.. I still believe they could be an excellent portable companion for those who use their Laptops to give presentations given the ability to boost the volume.
2,Too Heavy,"The sound was fine but after a week or too it seemed to be ""bending"" the usb port on my 13"" macbook. A few days later the sound suddenly stopped working then started again; the next day my macbook wouldn't start. Apple said the problem was software related. I'm putting mine up for sale on ebay."
5,Very cool and powerful mini USB speakers,"Since my laptop's internal speaker system isn't useful for much more than alert beeps from lack of power, this baby was needed to provide some oooomph for the sound. It does so in spades. OK, so it's not going to blow your scarf back but it's a huge improvement over the internals. Stereo. Stiff gooseneck holds it right where you want it. On my Mac I had to go into the sound control panel and select the USB device over the default internal speakers. Easily done. One small beef: no volume control on the unit itself; that would have been nice. However, the OS sound output setting must be used for the internal speakers, so it's not that much different. Just louder. Cool device!"
2,Overpriced! Crashes Windows XP,If these speakers were $19.99 they would recieve more stars. But for $40 they are way overpriced. Sound is decent -the next step up from most built-in laptop speakers. My laptop runs Win XP Pro SP2 and if I plug the jLab speakers in they crash the system into a reboot!Where would you find any support for these? Does jLab even have a website with any kind of help or support? It doesn't look like it.Therefore my 2 stars.
4,pedal bike,great for the elderly who need to keep moving. i bought it for my dad and it is great exercise as he watches TV.
5,"Amazing bright colors, photo quality","I was looking for several wall decals that could go with the theme of my baby's room. After extensive research I decided to go with this one as far as fish goes, because I liked the bright colors, the variety and also the fact that it offers different sizes of the same fish. Not disappointed at all. To begin with I received the package in within couple of days, which is about normal delivery for Amazon, for whatever product I ordered in the past. So to me just for this only it gets 5 stars :PAlso I used these decals on a flat surface wall, but also on a regular textured wall and found to stick just fine on either one of the surfaces. This is a big plus! The price is also the lowest i found on any decal of similar quality so I strongly recommend this product.I have no cons as of right now so I will give this product 5 stars!A.G"
5,A Must-Read,"If you love books like Harry Potter, Aragon, and Elder, you'll enjoy Prince Ezrick and the Morpheas Curse. Jordan is an exciting new author and has brought kids yet another fast-paced fantasy adventure."
2,"Lots of features, alignment problems","Am not happy with this product. Took a while to learn to use it, but still can't get the cards to align. I am using Avery Clean Edge (no perforations) Business Cards product 8871 in conjunction with this software. The bottom edge keeps getting off more and more until the 5th row is off a lot. The software allowed me to select Avery 10 business cards per sheet but does not align. Appears to have millimeters and inches interchanged in the wording at times with this German software. Had to experiment and plug in 1.001 to get the horizontal alignment. If I spend another two hours may get it to work. Has tons of backgrounds. Very powerful functions and lots of nice formats, but what good is it if you can't just simply use it."
2,"Wont fit, not easy","Am not happy with this product. Took a while to learn to use it, but still can't get the cards to align.

Very powerful functions and lots of nice formats, but what good is it if you can't just simply use it."
2,East is more than Japan,"If you think that Eastern style is all about Japanese style and minimalism then this is the book for you. But if you think Asia includes India, Thailand, Burma, Bali, Korea etc, you will find this book and its aesthetic a huge disappointment. I did. Stick with Kelly Hoppen."
5,Beautiful Photos and Ideas,"I am about to purchase a condo and was wondering how I wanted it decorated... I always loved the minimalistic, Japanese, Zen style... So I ended up with this book... And what a find... I don't know where to start first... GREAT PHOTOS AND IDEAS!"
5,A Great Poet,"Hikmet is not only important for Turkish Poetry which has a unique and high level in the world,but also a major figure in world literature.Everyone interested in poetry should read him."
4,Good overall/ needs more guitar,"This cd is definitely worth the money, wish they would go a little further, cant really explain it but it just felt too safe/rehearsed..."
5,"the fastest, the best","This is the absolute best video card available as of 6/16/02 for gaming. Even if you don't know much about hardware, I'll explain to you. What makes this so great is it is compatible with the newest upcoming games such as Unreal 2 and Doom III. It will be compatible with Direct X 9 and sports all the features it'll need for the future. This thing is so fast that you can enable 4x anti-aliasing and antroscopic filters while still having playable frame rate per second. Nothing is faster than this hot rod. VisionTek is also very respectable. This brand comes from the fastest of the fastest."
4,Card is excellent but there are other 3rd party manufacturer,"I recommend this 4600 beacause it is the best of the best. The newest card on the market is the 9700 Radeon but it has motherboard compatability issues that Radeon conveniently blames on motherboard manufacturers. This issue is due to the new AGP 8x that radeon is having trouble with.Stick with NVidia as they are the tried and true product for high quality graphics. I do recommed getting the 4600 128MB DDR from LeadTek, Gainward, or MSI. These three 3rd party maufacturers come with better heatsinks on the card to prevent this monster graphics card from overheating too much. They are also in my opinion are the best 3rd party maufacutrers of Nvidia-based card."
5,This is AMAZING!!!!!,"Well, I updated my computer from a TNT2 32mb video memory to the incredible Xtasy Geforce4 Ti 4600 with 128mb of video memory and my computer get crazy. I had never seen something like this. The graphics are perfect and all my games like Medal of Honor or Grand Theft Auto III with all the graphics options to the max, look perfect and I dont have to worry about how the game will run because it just looks and plays smooth. I love it. I can watch Tv on my computer with the Tv in/out option and even watch my games later. If you are looking for excellent graphics and a perfect video card this is the one for you!!\P.D. Is better that you have at least 128mb of RAM to backup the gams and the necessary space to install the video card because it is really big. JeJE!!! It is just perfect!!"
1,Too much $$$$$,"This card is overpriced, comparing to new Rodeon 9700.Geforce has no chance, see the results for your self in 3D Mark 2001CE."
1,"Good card, bad manufacturer","I've been having problems with this card for a long time. VisionTek's website is hideous. There is nearly no information available on the website. The tech support is relegated to either an email which goes unanswered or a tech support number which is only available when you're not near your computer.If good support is important for you, then take a pass on this company."
2,no tea taste,"Not as good as my previous purchases. The tea texture was a bit rough, and the after taste was not pleasant. Will try the loose leaf black tea version next time."
5,Great every day tea,"This is my favorite black tea. It is strong and flavorful. In the past, I've brought the bulk 6 pack but Amazon doesn't seem to stock it anymore. This turns out to be a better deal and it has a long expiration date. The downside is having to buy some storage containers but for this tea I'm more than willing to spend a bit up front to continue having a couple great cups every day."
3,Boris and Bela in Good Form,"Though it doesn't reach the heights of ""The Black Cat"" (1934), ""The Invisible Ray"" (1936) remains an intriguing Karloff-Lugosi vehicle with its offbeat mixture of horror and sci-fi elements. For both actors, it's a definite change of pace. Boris chews the scenery as the radiation-poisoned scientist, while Bela effectively underplays his part as the sympathetic colleague. The film might have been stronger if Karloff and Lugosi had switched roles. Still, ""The Invisible Ray"" survives as a memorable chiller and John Fulton's special effects are excellent."
5,It works great,"This is a commercial grade heavy duty heater. I placed this on a 600 sq ft enclosed patio to take the chill out when my electric Heater reaches it peak. In 15 min, my patio goes from 63 to 70 degrees. No complaints ... Great unit"
1,Heat? Heat what?,This is the poorest excuse of a patio heater. Stay away! We have it next to our hot tub. Thought it would help after exiting the tub. Ha! What a waste of money. Best advice we can offer is go to your local LP gas dealer for sizing your patio heater for your part of the country. We have been in the pool/spa business for 32 years and have seen a lot of inadequacies. I have to say that this is the first time getting bitten this badly. Bottom line.....Don't waste your money here.
4,Works perfectly!,"I downgraded this from 5 stars because I had to shim the internal framework in order to get the center post perpendicular with the base. Other than that, it was easy to assemble and the finish of the metal was flawless. As the other poster pointed out, make sure you install a battery in the igniter. This heater puts out great radiant heat, which means it feels like the suns rays shining on you. It will heat up surfaces, including chairs, tables, couches and your skin, in about a 6 to 8 foot RADIUS from the heater. The heat becomes less pronounced as you get close to the floor/ground and you will notice that the surfaces facing away from the heater, i.e. your back at times, won't be heated. However, for open spaces this is the only viable method of heating. Convection heaters, i.e., heaters that heat and circulate the air, do very little outdoors as the heat is quickly lost to the atmosphere. Highly recommended."
4,Love it,"We use this often. One of the reasons we selected this particular patio heater was the reviews and information I found about the starters on the less expensive heaters. Which is funny, because we haven't use the lighter yet. It requires batteries, a size we didn't have around the house, so we have been lighting it manually. Works great. Looks great. Love it."
4,Works great so far,Easy to assemble - we have used it several times and it works great so far. Heats a 10X12 patio area.
5,The Ungame,Can Be used in so many settings as a family game with small groups and as a theraputic aid. Have used them all with great success.
3,Special Christian Label,"Buyers should be aware that this game came with a sticker on the front saying ""Christian Version"". While this may be what some are looking for, it may not be what you are looking for."
1,Definitely lives up to its name,"I was sucked into ""playing"" this a few years ago at a retreat weekend. It was the only ""game"" that still had all its pieces. After having experienced it, I know why. It never stayed out of the box long enough to lose its bits.Now, granted, I'm not an overly communicative type of guy. But I enjoy games, and when my talkative friends wanted to play, I was willing to give it a shot. By 5 minutes into it, even they were bored and were looking for excuses to leave. We moved on from pretending to go around the pointless board to just rifling through the questions for any good ones. The whole experience lasted all of ten minutes before we put it away.I've played fun communication games. There is a point and a purpose in playing those games: You can win. There is no win scenario in this ""game"". Did War Games and WOPR teach us nothing? If there is no winner, what's the point in playing?"
1,UnLikely to be a family game at my house,"I was almost mortified to see this offered as a family game. I am thirty two years old and have very uncomfortable memories of being forced to play this game over and over with a grade school counselor. The fact that I remembered this game unfavorably twenty five years later speaks for itself. While it may be a special sharing touchy feely game and all, I agree with the other reviewers. No offense to the creator, but I would not play this with my children. Instead I will buy them Barbies and Hungry Hippos and just PLAY and spend time with them. Maybe if my parents had played regular games with me like Monopoly or Go Fish I would not have been subjected to the school counselor in the first place."
1,BOOORING,"I was hoping that this game would help my family communicate better. The rules of the game are tough (absolutely NO talking unless it's your turn), and that's supposed to help with communication. That's OK ... it actually sometimes works. The part that was frustrating was that the questions are pretty dull, so the answers were boring. Also the game has no set ending point. No one wins or loses. Instead you set a timer and play for a given amount of time. My family and I much prefer the game ""Life Stories."""
2,Wouldn't Stick!,"I made sure that I followed the directions precisely, but these just refused to stick for me! I was clean, and not hot, sweaty, or oily, I'd used no products or lotions on my skin, but still no luck. I tried two pairs that day, and the third on another occasion and they did absolutely nothing for me, they just refused to stick even the slightest bit to my skin."
1,You DO NEED the scroll wheel,"to fast forward or reverse. So it is dumb to lose access to this important function. If you listen to books, talk radio shows, or even long concerts encoded onto one file, you'll have difficulty if you need to reverse/forward. The manufacturer should have thought of something better. Heck, the firmware for the player seems to be programmed by a 14-year old (in fact, 14-year olds can do better!)."
5,Entertaining and Realistic; A joy to read,"Callaway does a great job of presenting real life situations that are both entertaining and insightful. This book goes beyond theory and addresses management application. Whether you're starting out as a new manager or a seasoned professional, you'll find this book worth your time."
2,Not What I Expected for the Money,"First off - the journal is incredibly overpriced for what you get. The paper is not as thick and nice as I thought it would be by reading the other reviews. The front is made from some sort of furry material. My journal came delivered wrapped in plastic, but had something spilt down the front of it - which was gross. If this product was priced at would it should be - around $25, I would give it a better rating. For $75, these people should be ashamed of themselves for charging this much for something I could have easily made myself. I'm sending it back."
5,Exceed our expections,This journal contained more information than we expected. When reviewing the book you get a sneak peak at a few items but it contains much more. I bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it.
3,Not Impressed,"I am a huge fan of both Tracy Hitchings and Clive Nolan, but this CD left me cold. Tracy's vocals are buried and Clive's keybard work is not up to par. This bears little resemblance to Arena or Landmark, being almost New Age in its composition. For completists only."
3,Good for the money,"Bought this for my lab/pitt puppy, it fit alright, she didn't fill it out, she was about 20lbs. Also the hat didn't really stay on so that was disappointing. Everyone thought she looked very cute so it was a huge hit. Happy with my purchase but only gave it a 3 because the hat didn't stay up."
3,Cute but the head is too small,I have a male pug. The custome is cute but the head space is too small so my dog moves a little and it slips off to his neck.
5,"Excellent Product, as with Season One",This product continues what was started with the release of Season One at the end of last year. These made for TV animated features are terrific and faithful to the books. We are so glad they are now available for reasonable prices in the U.S.
4,Tintin,"I got turned on to The Adventures of Tintin in fifth grade, which was about 20 years ago. I remember that alot of kids in my class wanted to read the books, which were available to check out in the school library. And there never were any copies available when i wanted to check one out. It used to make me mad, I'm laughing right now thinking about it. We were all so obsessed with wanting to read those books that year.And now, they have made a Tintin movie. I'll have to see it sometime. This DVD set here is the second series of episodes they released for the cartoon series, from the early 90's.The episodes in this set are: The Shooting Star, The Broken Ear, King Ottokar's Sceptre, Tintin in Tibet, Tintin and the Picaros, Land of Black Gold, and Flight 714. Six of those are two-part episodes, which makes a total of 13 episodes in this set."
2,Disappointed,"If you have a prayer book, you have this already. I expected more, but it is just what it claims to be."
5,Great Music,"I saw them perform for Princess Diana's concert. I really didn't know who they were until I checked out some of their other music on Amazon. I recognized them almost at once. This is a wonderful offering, Patience caught my ear, and I had to hear more. I'm glad I bought the CD, and have downloaded older tracks as well. Well worth buying, I would recommend this to anyone. I may be wrong, but I felt the last few tracks were influenced by some of the Beatles music, and maybe a little of the Bee Gee's. ENJOY!"
3,Gary Should Sing Lead On all the songs,"""I'd Wait For Life"" Is The Only Song That sounds Like Gary Barlow's Voice.I prefer ""Take That"" with Gary singing all the leads. If your a Big Gary Barlow Fan you won't like This CD that much. I was disappointed he didn't sing all the leads. This Other ""singer"" does not even compare to Gary.And if I am wrong and Gary is singing lead on other songs, His voice changed for the worse.Gary....Get a solo CD out, you don't need these other 3 guys !!!that other guy ( I think Owen) has a bad voice......It Was a ""Beautiful World"" when Gary sang all the leads for Take That."
1,Not The Best,"If You Like The Old ""Take That"" this Is Not for you.I have all The Cd's They put out and This New One STINKS! compared to the rest, doesn't even sound like them"
2,"Ummm...Yeah, Right","Alrighty then.Mr Barlow and co. have finally seen the light, the tail lights of Robbies train. ""OI!,"" Gary said ""I should round up the boys and we could make some lucre off this Robbie bloke!""How sad MR. Barlow, how f&*(#$g sad.I have heard most of this album and think that it sounds great, for a new Robbie Williams cd. Didn't like Rudebox? Well Gary and the boys are here for ya.If this CD does make it in America, it will be because Mr. Williams has primed the market for some two-bit hacks to step in and steal his spotlight.TAKE THAT!"
4,england vs the states,this is one cd that did not seem to make it over here at all. i saw one of the video's Shine and that song was great it was a great work.i could not get this song Shine any other way then gettting the whole cd and once i got it i was shocked to hear there voices it was really good.
5,Superwinch Wireless Controller,"Working great so far haven't had it installed for very long, but it was very easy to install like I said so far so good haven't had a chance to check to see how much range it has or how long the batteries last in the remote, but I guess time will tell."
2,DOWN COMES THE MOUNTAIN,"Considering the premise has already been utilized in a movie called AVALANCHE, this little movie isn't all that bad but it's far from classic cinema.A new condominium complex is endangered by irresponsible blasting and since there is a villain out to keep his name clean, the resulting landslide is not a surprise. Once again, we have a hero who is estranged from his wife and son, and a corporate biggie who is the wife's daddy, too. Everything pretty much goes as expected and unfortunately the special effects are pretty inadequate.For disaster movie freakos, this one's passable."
3,So So,After wathching 10.5 this disaster movie brought me back to earth real quick..It was watcheable but played more like a soap opera with all these sub-plots.Buy it second hand....
2,So Deep It is hard to uncover the story.,"At least 3 times I have started watching this Buried Alive movie,... it is just so dumb and so boring I stop and eject it every time. I agree with another reviewer-this movie must be filled with Soap Opera actors/B Movie stars. Don't waste your time or money on this movie. It is slow and I suppose there is some moral there but I am not sure what. I saw a review of this movie where it is referred to as 4 obituaries,... which must say a lot about the plot and signifigance of it. Well enough said. You review it if you want to waste time."
2,Not particularly well written,"This book is neither particularly insightful, nor particularly well written for the experimentalist. I suppose if you are a student learning programming concepts through the use of a graphical language it will suffice, but if you are actually trying to hook your computer up to equipment using this book -- look elsewhere."
5,Best video creator yet!!!,This software is outstanding! Best I've seen in a while. Very user-friendly and allows you to create a CD-R that you can play on your DVD player...WITHOUT A DVD!!! I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a great program at a great price!!
4,Mostly favorable,"This book is the most profound statement of McLuhan's theories, filled with memorable quotes and odd ideas. Sometimes, however, the ideas are inadequately supported, and the narrative is organized very oddly. (It's all part of his ""mosaic"" method of understanding.) However, this is probably the easiest of McLuhan's books to digest, and many of his statements are very relevant to our modern lifestyle. Buy the book."
1,A remarkable collection of nonsense,"I have rarely found so much nonsense compressed between the covers of a book. This a collection of unwarranted, groundless assertions, irresponsible generalizations and shameless one-upmanship. The success of the book in the 60's is proof of the intellectual despair that marked that decade, attempting to get out of the Vietnam Tragedy throug false gurus and other unsubstantiated claims to objectivity. The few pearls are buried under such a mountain of bull that it is not worth the effor to search for them. Mr. McLuhan pretends to know about everything, and shows he knows absout nothing, with the possible exception of English literature. And even there, his judgments are rarely valid and most of the time intellectually irresponsible. This is not a serious book. Future generations will look at it and judge our enthusiasm for it as proof of our immaturity. I gave it one star because I could not give it zero."
5,Wonderful Shaving Cream!,"Despite the higher cost associated with Geo F. Trumper products, I feel it's worth it. This tube lasts a long time, as only a drop in a cup is necessary. However the main reason I bought it was the fabulous aroma! This stuff smells great! I absolutely love using it. I'm also looking forward to trying several of the other fragrances...like Rose. You certainly can't go wrong with this product. I wish I could buy it locally - so I wouldn't have to wait so long to start using it again."
5,a must have item,"Very foamy, great smell, economy to use, less irritation, and I will buy it again even though it cost me more to get it shipped to me (since I live in Kuwait)..I can't believe I didn¡t hear about this cream in the past 18 years of shavingPS: I've used it with Mack3 shavers and I felt the difference but try using it with a Badger brush"
1,A Non-Starter,The compact flash card would not give up its images. I could review pictures in the camera but they could not be transferred to my computer. A totally unsatisfactory product.
5,VCaps(veggie capsules) veggie supplement,"Two thumps up Nature's way, So far the best veggie supplement reasonably price too and the good thing which made us buy this product as compare to other veggie supplements is that they are in veggie capsule (no animal by product non gelatin pork derived). Hope to see more and more capsules in VCaps. Have recommended it to many friends and family this veggie supplement in VCAPS."
4,Garden Veggies is a great product,I think this is a good product for people who need supplementation for better nutrition. The automatic ordering offers a better price.
3,Veggie Boost,"I'm not always sure that I'm getting enough veggiesso I take 3 Garden Veggies a day. They give me a little bit of energy, nothingsuper-hero-like. This is one of the only green food type supplementsthat I can take because most have barley grass-which containsgluten- which I'm allergic to."
3,Works but nothing special,"I received this as a gift for my 10"" dutch oven of unknown manufacure (it was the family oven from 30-40 years ago).The good: It is Made in the USA (much to my surprise), the oven fit well, straps seem sturdy to be able to hold up. It is less cost than the Lodge (although I can not compare, as I don't have one of those)The bad: The fabric is not as nice as my other dutch oven cases, it is very plastic like, and does not have any padding at all.Overall, it does what it says, so I am satisfied, but if you want a premium cover, this is not it."
5,Wow,Met all expectations and then some. Love the way the latches work. Very good size for anything that would fit in a briefcase.
2,Very Poor Quality....I would return it if postage weren't so expensive.,"These are the very poorest quality dominoes and set that I have ever purchased.I would return it if I hadn't already opened it and if the return postage wasn't so expensive. The dominos are not smooth and the paint is smeared. The colors are odd and the trains are of poor color...two are very nearly the same color The train engine won't whistle, and the case won't last long it is so flimsy. And to top it off, the directions are not written clearly or in proper language at all. If I didn't already know the rules of the game, I certainly couldn't learn to play from these directions. I would find another manufacturer to purchase the Mexican Train Game from."
5,"LCD down, Images Keep going","I have had the Polaroid for over 3 years and the LCD went down June 8. This is a great camera despite how I abused it, dropped it, and used it for over 350 MB of images. I use a work around monitor and it continues to keep recording great video and stills. I foolishly bought a SONY Cyber-shot DSC-S2100 to replace my """"roid"" and very unhappy with the SONY. All the negs on the SONY are true on AMAZON reviews. I did have the ""roid"" beep and shut off, but that was corrected with fresh professional AA batteries. My son's Olympus is a non func. as we lost the charger for the lithium battery, I use a SONY DSC F707, Canon ZR 500, SONY HD Handycam, Canon F-1 single-lens reflex camera from the 70s and rely on my Argus C-3 from the 50s for the really good photos, So much for technology."
5,History of the Iraq War,"Cobra II and The Endgame, both books by Michael Gordon and Bernard Trainor, are a must read of the Iraqi war. Whether you were pro- or anti-war these books are worth reading. The story here is ""wide spectrum"" in the sense that they cover the political, diplomatic, and military aspects of the war. In the end it is a cautionary tale about what Barbara Tuchman called the folly of history. Excellent and highly recommended."
3,Well researched....,"... but don't expect anything ""Mark Bowden""-like in its readability. While the book is undoubtedly thorough and even-handed, sections describing battles (e.g. the ambush at Nasiriyah) are long and immensely complex. Also, I found myself having to constantly refer to the index to remind myself who a particular person was and where they fell in the chain of command in which branch of the military. Although this is certainly the result of such indepth research, reading it felt a bit more like work rather than something I enjoyed. However, overall you're unlikely to find something so comprehesive in its scope."
2,THIS BOOK WEIGHS EIGHT AND A HALF POUNDS,"An academic asked to review a ponderous tome of literary criticism penned one of the the best short reviews ever, when he said, ""This book weighs 17 pounds."" The problem with Cobra II is not that it is inaccurate in its tale of how the easy military conquest of Iraq turned into a complicated and sticky insurgency. It is not wrong in its judgement that those in the field increasingly ""got it"" while their superiors in Washington did not. It is that the tale is told in such overwhelming detail and in such a boring way that slogging through it becomes a chore instead of a pleasure. A look at Fiasco, which is nearly equally detailed, shows how a similar narrative, fair but impassioned, keeps the reader turning pages."
4,Objective recording.,This book gives fine detail to the ground plan implemented by the military in Iraq. Makes you grateful we had such a fine president in office while all of these events transpired.
5,The Truth: Part I,"Finally, a book that tells it like it is, warts and all: The convoluted debacle that US Marines found themselves involved in An Nasiryah. The unfortunate relief of command of Colonel Joe Dowdy, USMC. The tug of war between military and civilian leadership. The dubious path of judgement that has lead our country into a war that is currently trying our country's patience. The authors approach the subject with a fair mind and without bias. Simply put, the best and most balanced account of Operation Iraqi Freedom I (OIF I) to date. I can only hope that the latter stages of OIF are represented in as much detail and accuracy as this fine volume . . ."
3,straw man,"An interesting book, but the authors make the fatal mistake of setting up a straw man argument, suggesting that the entire reason behind the iraq invasion was WMD, whereas it was made very clear - enimently clear, and compellingly so - that Iraq was a dictatorial empire whose cruelty was matched probably only by the Nazis, and had to be brought down. Their chapter on Hussein makes no mention of any atrocities, butchery, etc. but simply paints a picture of a man who either had or did not have WMD. This would be comparable to writing a history of German aggression in WWII without mentioning the concentration camps but focusing solely on Hitler's military strategy. As a result, the authors conveniently conclude the war was a mistake based on an easy and altogether unconvincing argument. That being said, the book is quite a read."
4,Two Sides to a Story,"This is a very good book; well written, topical and informative, as almost all previous reviewers have agreed.In war, however, as in love, politics, history or anything controversial, there are always at least two sides of the story. Gordon/Trainer tell the side based on information they obtained mostly from sources with whom they had extensive access (predominately land based officers). Hopefully, we will soon be able to compare that version with that from the Pentagon, US Air Force, Coalition partners and even the Iraqis, most of whom didn't seem to talk with these authors. Don't close your mind until then."
3,Good beginning,The authors attempt to weave a history of the war based largely on the accounts of those who would talk to them. As a result it is not a balanced and complete history. Many of the sources had particularly strong points of view that come out as criticisms of decisions made. A more balanced history might suggest that the US did pretty well in this war although there were many mistakes made. And blunders will continue to be made; we know of no war without lots of them.Its a good read nevertheless and very informative. Some parts are absolutely gripping.
5,A non-fiction thriller,"Donald Rumsfeld is arguably one of the more tragic figures in U.S. history. Cobra II describes his rise to military emminence. Rumsfeld understands that power is power only when it's exercised. Still, he reached too far. Many who were drawn into his gravitational field should have known better. Trainor and Gordon have written a psychological thriller."
1,A great movie to see lens flare,"Poorly done, poor photography. While I expected to see only sunsets in this feature I expected some good photographic work. This is terrible."
2,Makes a nice space heater!,"I have now tried two SMC wireless Barricades (this unit and it's newer version, and both have ""crapped out"" after a few months.Unfortunately, I also had problems with their older, wired router. Although I have ensured that there is adequate air circulation, and the ambient temperature never exceeds 70 degrees, it appears that these units are prone to overheating. (...)I found that my internet access was getting slower and slower, and my FTPs were aborting more and more frequently.Also, be aware that if you upgrade the firmware, you WILL lose all your settings (you [cannot] read the old .bin file back in!)[Be sure] to write down ALL your current settings [before] doing an upgrade!It's too bad, since I have been a proponent of SMC ever since they marketed one of the first high speed UARTs many years ago!"
2,Poor Customer Service,"I had no problem setting the hardware up, etc. Had slight difficulty with my work VPN. Hardware performs average. The biggest issue I have with SMC is their customer service (they stiffed me on my rebate, and did not reply back to my e-mails, etc), and therefore will not purchase anymore of their products."
1,Worthless,"I bought this wireless router without reading the reviews... a big mistake. This router's wireless features failed consistently. Usually within 12 hours of setting it up (or resetting it up on the subsequent attempts) the wireless connection would suddenly be lost as would the wired connections. Tech Support was not terribly helpful, all they could suggest was ""resetting"" the router. In fact, they recommended I return the router to the store. I see this as a reflection of their lack of confidence in the product.I have used other SMC routers (including setting up a different, older model as a wireless access point) so I consider this a glitch in an otherwise fine company's products, but the SMC7004VWBR should be avoided at all costs."
1,DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT,"I made a HUGE mistake, I bought this router before read the customer review.....This item works fine until I set up encryption mode, because I really need it, but it stop to work. Installation is really easy, but al least 50% of features doesn't work. Advice, go for others vendors, I will ship a Linksys."
1,Don't buy SMC,"Completely random blocking of functionality- sometimes I can click a link and it works sometimes I can't, sometimes I can send an email sometimes I can't. Problem goes away when not using SMC router. Repeated emails to customer support are repeatedly IGNORED. Would NEVER buy from them again."
2,Very Short Range,"My friends and I purchased this wireless router for use in our dorm, and we were sorely disappointed with the range. Our dorm is 100'x75' and we were not able to find a place anywhere in the dorm that allowed this router to reach the whole floor. We would get about 50% signal strength about 4ft from the router. From there it would drop to 0% only 50ft away. The software that came with it was very good, and did not require you to install anything like the linksys routers do, but limited range trumped out all of the positive features that it had. I have owned/purchased for others multiple standard SMC routers that were excellent, but if you are going to be going wireless stay away from SMC."
2,Good feature set but very unreliable,This router has a very nice feature set but very unreliable. First the wireless AP stops working if no wireless connection for an extended period. Also 128 bit encryption is not reliable. Have to reboot the router to get it work again. Second the whole traffic stops for no obvious reason randomly. Cant even get the configure page. again have to reboot the router. hit that twice and I am extremely annoyed since I host my own mail server. called the customer service. the guy was polite but knew even less than I do about technical issues. I hope they will release firmware upgrade soon to fix those issues. currently I switch to a netgear FM114P but will wait for a while before I sell the SMC on some local list.
1,Drops connections - poor customer service,"I have to reboot the router every day. There is not live support, you have to email the customer service. They recommended to reinstall old firmware. Did not help. I hate it!!"
3,"Overall, a good bang for the buck","Setup was straightforward and it appears to work perfectly fine. I did notice that my wi-fi card was unable to get a signal when I got home the other day. I reset the router and it was then able to get a signal. Not sure exactly what's up, but resetting the router resets everything (password, settings, etc)."
1,completely unreliable as a wireless router,"This router is one of the cheapest available, and, like all routers, was easy to setup out of the box.However, as other people have mentioned, the wireless connection got dropped fairly frequently (every 30 minutes). I have not had trouble with this at the airport, at work, or with my Netgear 4 port/wireless router.Further examination showed that the wired connections had also quit working altogether. Plugging the cable modem directly into my computer narrowed this down entirely to the router.A firmware upgrade to 1.20a seemed to fix the problems with the wired connections, and seemed to improve the wireless temporarily, but soon shut that out. It needed another power cycle (30 seconds) to turn it back on.Now I am just using the wired connection with a long ethernet cable with the firmware upgrade, but will be returning this very soon."
1,Extremely Dissapointing,Connected the cable modem to the router which I then hooked to my PC ethernet port. Followed directions for their 3-click setup.Set up was easy. The hard part was yet to begin. Downloading popular web pages was a nightmare. Over 2 mins to get yahoo. No problem with my old Linksys. I then tried connecting the router to a switch. It did not recognize the interface (lights did not turn on. ) Again no problem with my old Linksys. A firmware upgrade did not help either. I was hoping to replace my router and WAP with a single unit. Very dissapointed.
1,A problem pack !,"[A] Needs a mandatory restart every 16 hours asa) The router hangs responding quite often.b) Internet connectivity speed drops by this time.[B]My wireless card detects all other wireless routers in my neighbourhood, while this Router takes atleast 10 minutes to reciprocate.[C]Horrible Manual. Mentions all about installation, which any lamer could get along with. But no section on trouble-shooting.[D]Pathetic Customer support.I got so sick of this router that I did away with the cover and decided to follow the circuit myself !Horrible router."
2,Too buggy,"This router is easy to set up and easy to use. The wireless networking is great, especially with a laptop. However, the router is a little two buggy.I've had this router for about a year, and it seems that the device needs to be reset about once a week. The network slows down, particular websites will fail to load, and eventually, the entire wireless network shuts down.When it works, the device is fantastic, but it is too high maintenance."
1,Fine router if you don't need wireless,"Had all kinds of trouble with wireless functionality. As I booted my laptop (with a netgear wireless card), I could watch the router (through the Barricade status page) assign an IP to the node, then drop it seconds later. The node would still have the assigned IP address, but the barricade would not list it as a connected node. Sometimes the barricade wouldn't even assign an IP address to start with. Neither behavior was consistent, so I found myself constantly rebooting, or performing ipconfig/releases & renews, to establish connectivity. Real hassle. I returned it."
3,Cable Modem Issues,"This review is not to bash or praise the SMC7004VWBR in any way. This is ment as an FYI to potential buyers. The SMC7004VWBR has combatibility issues with the Motorola CyberSUFER Wave Modem. This is an older legacy modem so it may not apply to most. The router worked awesome for me EXCEPT when connecting to the internet. When I connect to the internet the speeds drop to almost nothing... Spoke to SMC tech support and this is a know issue with this router and modem combo. Unfortunatlly, I was disconnected before being able to ask if a future firmware release will adress the issue. On the other hand, my ISP (TW RoadRunner) is going to allow me to swap it out for a newer modem at no charge. As I said, this is just an FYI for potential buyers. Check your modem before buying this router to make sure you wont have the same issues I had to deal with."
3,Router's wireless signal go dead every morning,"As long as you have a wireless client running, the router/AP runs well.But if there is no wireless client, after 1 night, the Access Point stops providing wireless access.Every morning I turn on my laptop, the Cisco wireless card of my laptop just keeps searching... without connected, until I restart the Router. (unplug/plug power)Will go to ask for a replacement to try, then decide to keep it or return."
2,Great Features - Horrible Wireless,"I wish I had paid more attention to some of the other reviews on this product. The price is just so seductive though. The installation was a breeze as promised although documentation was very scarce. Initially I was delighted to be up and running in minutes upon plugging everything in. Great features on router and easy maintenace. HOWEVER signal strength is just plain horrible for wireless access. I have problems at times in the same room (5 friggin feet away). Firmware upgrades, switching channels, moving phones, etc... just doesn't solve problem. Spend the extra few dollars and get another brand."
4,"Good, but need some configuration.","At the first a few days of using this router, it locked up a lot. I found out that when I am using my 2.4GMhz cordless phone, the SMC router locks, which doesn't happen when I use my Microsoft wireless router. The only different between them is that the MS router sets the channel to 5 while the SMC sets to automatic by default.I updated the firmware, and set the channel to 5. After that, it works perfectly with my Microsoft and Dlink wireless pc card with no any single problem at all.I am using it under 64 bit WEP. Didn't try 128 bit WEP."
1,15 minutes of fame,"This machine is heavy but not built very well. It lasted 15 minutes before the cutter blade and the plastic pusher block came in contact with each other and damaged both. I was cutting fresh red Lasoda irish potatoes. I weighed the potatoes I had cut, it was 10#. I will use a knife now. I don't think the cutter is sharp enough, they bend and contact the plastic pusher block."
5,A great book that you won't want to put down!,"Having been a big fan of Rucka's other books, I was eagerly anticipating the arrival of Shooting at Midnight. Fortunately, it was everything I had hoped for (and more!). This book takes a new direction by being told through the eyes of Bridgett Logan, whereas the other books were told by Atticus Kodiak. Rucka makes up for the fact that Logan was barely in Smoker by letting us know her history and how she thinks. I highly recommend this book (and all of Rucka's others, which I now plan to re-read)!"
4,Revitalized by a junkie,A new narrator and focus adds vigor and staying power to this series. The reader is hooked early and stays for the ride. A real good read. Let's hope this continues. Hit me with another shot.
2,Boring Protagonist Bridgett,"Having thoroughly enjoyed the previous Atticus Kodiak novels, I was totally disappointed by this outing of Rucka's. Bridgett the junkie is a rather shallow and stereotypical figure - - -and honestly ""who cares"". The central character of Kodiak is the draw for this series and while I did finish this book, the temptation was to toss it in the trash mid-way through. Now that Rucka has disappointed, I won't be pre-ordering the next novel. That one is likely to be from some other minor character's viewpoint."
2,Plot?,"This was my first Greg Rucka book, it was easy reading but the plot was not believable. Bridget decides to help Lisa and gets into worse trouble than Lisa is in. Bridget is supposed to know martial arts but still gets kicked around.I might try another of his books since other people have said they liked them. I give it two stars"
2,Improbable and badly written,"I enjoyed 'Keeper' and 'Critical Space' but this one was pretty bad. The grammar is so bad it made me wonder if Mr Rucka's first language is English? Or maybe his editor's isn't?The plot was very unlikely and the end was as predictable as they come. The secondary charcters were made of cardboard.If this were the first Rucka I'd read, it would be the last. I'm not sure if I'll bother with his books again"
2,Egypt: A Practical Guide,Having just returned from Egypt I found this book rather a blinkered view by a man with several bees in his bonnet. Although the descriptions of the tombs were good the book lacked the breadth and detail required by a first time traveller. It certainly lacked the kind of practical step by step realities needed to actually travel around and see these sites. I found the Rough Guide excellent in comparison.
3,"Not a practical guide, only a quick reference","It is a good book as it intends to be a quick reference, but not enough to plan a trip by it. I do find the name misleading. Not really what I expected."
4,didn't fit,"Really liked this crapper seat but it did not fit my toilet :( Ended up buying a different one, but i'm keeping this one to see if it fits the toilet in my new place."
5,ring adapter for camera,love this thing. i have an old slr camera and needed to have this to adapt the filters and lens to my digital.
2,Not the Right Ring,"I actually needed Step-Down Adapter Ring 58mm lens to 55mm Filter Size.Also, the Step-Up Ring 55mm Lens to 58mm Filter Size was NOT kept in usual rectangular box with information printed on the box. It was in a plastic bag. This is NOT professional way of selling rings.I will, however, keep the ring and have already requested the correct ring size. I am sure I will get the correct ring and then I will give 5 Star rating."
3,OK for the price,This memory is functional for the price. I did however return it and trade for one single 512MB stick instead of 2 256MB.
5,"Very good language, gripping story","My 11-years old was scared and mesmerized at the same time. He read the book in one evening and recommended it to his friends the next day. The age group is 11-13 years old, but I enjoyed reading it myself, since it is masterfully written. Note to parents: this book is too scary for children under 11."
4,Chapter 13: Literally the Final Chapter of Gorefest,"My final review on the Gorefest albums, since they deceided to split up after the tour of the album. And that's a shame, because after their period of ""musiscians-block"" this is again a fine peace of work. Although they make it all too clear what they're influences are (one example the song: ""Broken Wing"", sounds like the extreme version of ""Angel with the Scabbed Wings"" by Marilyn Manson), this album is unique and VERY heavy! They really tuned the bass and guitars to the maximum depth, a choice which only comes to it's right on this album. A great album, except the vocals on the song FreakShow 2000 (sounds like Foundation 2000??? hehehe); they're terrible! And finally they got they got the right production sound back. It's a shame they deceided to split up, since this was their retro of respect."
5,A great communicator giving authoritative advice,"This book is a God send. Rather than trying to tell you how to take so called 'good' exposures (like many other photo books), this book explains the techniques of exposure control and how to evaluate a subject so that you make more informed exposure decisions. This way your exposures will achieve your preferred creative interpretation of a scene. In other words, not a formulaic approach but an attempt to open up possibilities for the thinking/creative photographer.As Mark Nelson says in his review, the book has everything you want to know about exposure - a testament to the author who has packed the book with hundreds of useful insights written in clear prose.(Mark is right about the ONE error. But where is the book without typos? As for the lack of detail, books are written to a publisher's brief so it is a bit unfair to bash an author who was doubtless working to a publisher's word limit.)"
4,"small and compact, a true pocket dictionary","I bought this dictionary to replace a defective Langenscheidt's Pocket Dictionary. The size is nice as it is easier to carry around, and I like the plastic cover and blue headwords. I am an intermediate German student and so far I have found every word I was looking for. The only thing I don't like is that, unlike the pocket dictionary,it doesn't have the blue tabs for each section of the alphabet, which makes looking up several words faster. But don't be fooled, this one would actually fit in your pocket, unlike the actual pocket dictionary, which is bigger. The size of this one reminds me of the old Lilliput ones Langenscheidt used to make."
5,Theme Courses in Composition,This excellent text not only explains the specific relevance of Vygotsky's scholarship to composition but also Bakhtin's as well. The beginning chapters about why theme courses in college composition courses are the best explanation of how to meld a focus on writing with meaningful writing. The explanation of Bakhtin's heteroglossia as quarrel is genius. There is also a great chapter on portfolios and example syllabuses.
5,Outstanding!,"ER was an amazing series and as with all series to have one end is sad..This season was excellent, but i did not like the switching to Iraq episodes, as i do not like the Africa episodes. Seems like the regulars in the show get fewer and fewer, as the show progresses to the end which is sad. I really think ER was at its best when Doug..Mark..Benton..Carol..etc were there. I do not care much for the character Sam and seems like Kovak can never decide which woman he wants. It is disappointing to see Carter leave to go back to Africa and seems like Kem does not really care for him or love him, or she would have stayed with him. The baby dies, so she takes off not caring one bit about him. I have never seen ER all the way through, so am anxious to buy the last 4 seasons...Overall..The medical procedures are realistic, as well as showing the private struggles of the Doctors and Nurses..always suspenful..sometimes sad...One of the best TV series, I think that was ever shown."
2,Falling down,"As a huge fan of the series,I cannot say I'm pleased with this season. I just wanted to see what happened with Carter. The characters are weak,the storylines too. Very disapointed."
5,Old fashioned charm,"This book is extremely warm, cozy, and charming. The relationship that the little girl shares with her mother is precious, and of a nature that harkens back to the first half of the 20th Century. Frankly, I miss it. The story is basically a converation between mother and daughter, a very respectful and sincere communication, whereby the little girl talks about simple joys that children share with no one else. The mother listens intently and encourages her child in conversation. These types of stories are so real, so without pretense, and very basic, slice-of-life in nature; unfortunately, they're somewhat hard to find!! The illustrations are, again, slice-of-life, nothing fantastic or overly imaginative, adding to the straightforward, wholesomeness of the story. Charlotte Z. seems to specialize in books about mothers and daughters. I was raised on her stories and I'm glad they're still in print so that I can share with my daughter!"
5,Tsar Tarot,"The art on these cards is absolutely beautiful! I purchased them mostly to admire, not use... An elegant set of Tarot Cards."
5,Wizard of Oz Fans,"Our granddaughters just love the Wizard of Oz. They like to watch it every time they come to visit. They have watched it carefully, so I knew that drawings of Dorothy, Toto and the others would not do. This book is out of print, so a bit pricey, but based on the reception it received and the number of times they want to read it, it was well worth the price.The Wizard of Oz: Movie Storybook"
4,eeee.. it's ok,"loved track 2. Love Machine and 3. Biology, the rest is kind of bland. yes, yes, standard female-voice-britpop sound, still a little too bland and indistinct for my taste (with the exception of 2 tracks i mentioned above). It just doesn't get to carr yme with it. OK driving music."
3,From Good to Bad to Good,"A very clever book for about the first 100 pages. I loved the format, the story, and the characters, unfortunately it didn't last. By the time I got half way through the book I wanted to scream, ""Enough already!!! Stop dragging this out."" This would have been an excellent novel if shortened to 200 or 250 pages, but 431!!! Too many choppy e-mails, IM's and screwy unbelievable events dragged this book down. I wanted to like it, I really did. Oh well, not everything can be perfect."
2,Julie L.,"Extemely disappointing follow up! I enjoyed PS I LOVE YOU and was really looking forward to Ahern's next book, but ROSIE DUNNE did not live up to the previous novel. The plot was shallow and from just about the beginning the end became obvious. The narration laid out in the form of e-mails, letters and IM's lost it's novelty early on and became strangely reminiscent of Bridge Jones Diary, but was not nearly as interesting. At no point did I feel anything for Rosie or any of the other characters for that matter which made it extremely difficult to finish the book."
2,Skipping pages at a time...,"Ok, I can't believe this book got so many 5 star reviews and so little 1 and 2 star reviews. Like most people who read this book, I absolutely Loved PS I love you, but for this book I find myself literally skipping 2 or 3 pages at a time. I feel like the conversations between Rosie and Ruby are totally pointless and not funny. The only interesting ones (as someone else stated) are the ones between Alex and Rosie. I feel like this has been dragged out so long, and I'm still not finished. I also don't understand who writes such long emails with just complaining about EVERYTHING. It's boring. I'm about to just turn to the end and finish it before I die of boredom. I'm only finishing it because I actually spent money on it!"
3,Frustrating Read,"I really loved the main characters and quickly found myself caught up in the story! I couldn't wait for them to get together! But then the book dragged, and dragged. Halfway through I realized this book was not going where I wanted anytime quickly and I just wanted to skip ahead past all of the waste of space. The only interesting parts were between Alex & Rosie and I found myself skimming many other parts. Finally I get to the end after waiting and it is fizzles... all that build up and thats how she ends it?I will say ""the letter"" Alex wrote was beautiful and I could reread it over and over again!All in all a great idea, great main characters, much too long of a book for the story!"
3,Needed more editing,"I loved the beginning notes from Rosie to Alex (I actually laughed when I read the first few notes while I was in the library), but was bogged down in the middle only to be finally freed in the short ending. This book needed tighter editing, fewer pages, and less drama. As another reviewer stated, this book needed more development."
2,Hard to get through,First off Rosie Dunne is not a likeable character. For the life of me I cant understand why Alex is in love with her. He is a successful doctor and all she does is whine and she is soooooo depressed all the time. And every time they start to tell each other how they feel about each other something stands in the way. And that goes on chapter after chapter. If you like drawn out depressing books this is the book for you. However if you dont I would not recommend reading this book.
1,First Cecelia ahern book I DIDNT like!,"I usually LOVE cecelia Ahern books.. However I hated everything about this book. It had no story to it, it was like reading through someone's emails.. It was boring the whole time,I couldn't relate to Rosie at ALL because of her stupid and unrealistic choices, and when the book FINALLY ended.. it was nothing special at all. You could see it coming from page one. The ending leaves the reader dissapointed with nothing but a feeling of time wasted. I only rated this book with a one star because I finished it hoping it'd get better, it definitely did not!!"
2,Frustrating Format,"I have read a couple of her other books which were very good. I was very frustrated and pushed myself through about 25-30 pages. While I was already interested in the characters, I did not like the ""Letter"" format. I have forced myself through a couple of other books that were in ""Email"" format. I just don't understand why an author would do this. It is very slow and annoying. I really wish This book was available in the common format. I really enjoyed her other books and feel disappointed that I couldn't force myself to finish this one. My loss aparently because this book did get some good ratings....."
2,Disappointing book,"After reading ps. I love you, I was very disappointed by Love Rosie. The story was boring and there were no surprises...."
3,not her best,"I forced myself to finish this book, but it was a definite effort. I enjoyed ""P.S. I Love You"" MUCH more. The format of a book written as e-mails, letters, etc. only is a cute concept but leaves something to be desired in application. The story could work better as a movie...possibly. Hopefully her next book will be an improvement."
1,Lack of Development,"I was very disappointed when I read this book. As others have said in their reviews, I had to force myself to read each page. Because of the format of the book, you can't really see the relationship between the characters develop; you're told of events instead of being shown. The plot seems very cliche: two best friends in love and have trouble getting together, one deals with teen pregnancy...it's been done before. Unfortunately with this story, it is very difficult to become engaged and to fall in love with the characters."
1,infantile,"I guess I am inspired to write having read Rosie Dunne by Cecelia Ahern. It is a silly sort of plot going nowhere. I read it quickly as I felt bored by each page,email, etc. The novel's saving grace in my estimation is that it ends. The author also ends for me. I could not condone anymore suffering by nerdish plots and soppy storyline. It's in my rubbish bin."
5,"Romantic, Fun, Genius!","This book was absolutely amazing. It can be for all ages, it isn't baby-ish nor inappropriate. The style it is written in is so creative and so easy to follow. I couldn't put the book down! Cecelia Ahern did an amazing job and I can't wait to read more of her books! READ IT and LOVE IT!"
4,A truly feel good book,"I really enjoyed this book. I loved how it was written entirely from emails, letters, IM conversations, and other such notes. Very different in style from most books.The story of Rosie and Alex made me feel like I really knew them, and I could totally see myself in Rosie's role. I had a best friend like that at one point in my life, but we did eventually drift apart unfortunately.My only criticism is that it ended where it did. I would like to have seen at least one more chapter after the book's epilogue chapter.Overall though, a very enjoyable read! I would definitely recommend it to others."
3,Disappointed in the end,"Although I was very happy with the timing, quality, and price of my purchase, I was not completely satisified with the story. Not to try and spoil anything, but I wish things could have worked out sooner in the end. Some of the story did have me laughing hysterically, which I thoroughly enjoyed. My mom, however, loves this story and will listen to it until the CDs wear out. I am content with the one time that I listened. I did enjoy Cecilia Aherns writing style and will read another book by her."
5,outstanding,"i wonder if ms. ahearn ever reads these reviews, but if she does, she should know the wonderful job that she did on this book. it consistently brought smiles to my face, caused me to see the parallels in my own life, and the story was told in the most earnest manner. rosie dunne was a real person, who, at every step of her life, tried to remain true to herself yet was in touch with her fears and insecurities -- all while being able to laugh at everything. such an awesome character - ms. ahearn did any outstanding job making her real. what's not to love?"
2,Agree with Amazon's Review !,"I read this book...THEN read Amazon's review, and I couldn't agree with the Amazon review more!!! I quote, ""While this style is engaging at first, readers may eventually long for more substantial dialogue and fewer choppy exchanges. In fact, about halfway into the story, some may even feel the urge to skip ahead to what is almost an inevitable conclusion.""This is EXACTLY what I did!!! I skipped through the book thinking these notes and letters must end soon, and an actual story will begin to develop..no such luck.I found the characters shallow, and the ending predictable. I loved, ""PS I love You,"" but this one..no such luck."
3,A bit slow,"Ok, I liked this book and found the characters so endearing and realistic, despite them being revealed only in letters, but there was just too much going on and I really wanted more on Rosie and Alex and the ending was just so quick and easy, no buildup really. I liked the style of the letters but maybe for a much shorter book, not this one. It just seemed to drag along and I found myself only being able to read a little at a time before getting bored. I have read ""If You Could See Me Now"" and loved it. I just bought her newest and will start reading soon."
3,Not half the book 'P.S. I love you' was...,"After reading 'P.S. I love you' non-stop for a whole day I couldn't wait to read this, also because our surname is the same! The letter format is irritating but once your half way through you can't stop reading. It's written in a very ""Irish"" way and everyone can relate to all the mishaps that occur. I hope though that the third book (if there is one) will be as good as the first."
3,Released under the title 'Where Rainbows End',I believe this is the same book as 'Where Rainbows End' - It doesn't appear to state that anywhere.
3,Fair Read,"This is a mildly engaging tale that becomes rather tedious because of the writer's technique of revealing all only through emails, letters, and the like. Personally, if I'm going to spend a few hours reading a book, I'd like some real interaction between the characters, not just postmortem descriptions of what happened.That aside, the characters and their tales are rather interesting, and the author is skilled, and one can only hope that her next novel will take a different tack."
2,It's a snoozer,"I really enjoyed Ahern's first book and was very much looking forward to this onee. Alas, I finished it and am now disappointed. The book was slow, boring, and predictable. Further more, the format of letters/emails/IM's has been done many times before... and done better, at that.I'm afraid I really don't recommend this book even as a fun chick-lit filler."
4,FAB!!!,O my god howgood is this book?! i read it in just 2 days.... I did prefer 'ps i love you'but this was a close 2nd!! Its 1 of those books where you knew theyd eventually get together so a ltle predictable (as alot of books!) but wowee!!! however i am confused bcos my book was titled 'where rainbows end'is this the same 1?? i only realised this 'rosie dunne'sounded the same after reading some reviews & bits out of the book online.... can some1 confirm this?!!!overall a great read cant wait to read 'silver lining'
4,Rosie Dunne,"I was so excited to read this book b/c I thoroughly enjoyed PS I love you. I was not disappointed. I thought the format of the book v. creative as I have not read a book in that way before. (I'm sure that I am not the only one either) There were times when reading that you were anxious to see Rosie and Alex finally get together. It is heartbreaking to see and understand the emotion of this book. The ending I thought was well worth the wait. I can so relate as I keep letters, cards, and even some emails as keepsakes. I love it when I find a day w/ nothing to do(which is rare as I live a v. busy life!) and go through some of my life long momentos. The memories, laughters, and tears...I can so relate!I can't express enough how much I enjoyed reading this book. Ceceila if you're reading this please keep the books coming!! You have an amazing gift and I so envy your talent!!"
2,disappointed,"After reading PS I Love You, I was anxious to dive into another of Ahern's books. Luckily Rosie Dunne was only a library book, and not one I would've spent too much money on. I wish I would've thummed through it first. The entire book is email exchanges between the characters. I was surpised by the other positive reviews. This book was quite frankly, a headache. It was too easy to page ahead and ahead to get to the two main character's emails, as those were the only ones I was interested in. A WHOLE, ENTIRE BOOK OF EMAIL EXCHANGES! Confusing, unappealing to the eye, and boring."
3,Decent,This book was somewhat hard to understand and get into. I felt as if it was a mess to be completely honest. I ended up skipping through most of the book just to see what happens at the end and be done with the book. I personally didn't like this story very much nor how the book was set it. I probably won't be buying from this author again.
4,clever,I really enjoyed this book and felt it did not deserve some of the bad reviews. I felt it was a nice lighthearted story that came in a clever format.
3,Funny Yet Depressing,"While the format of the book (communiques between characters) is a fast and easy read, the story at times suffers for it because it limits how the story could be told. I listened to the Anna Fields read (who's great by the way) and she made it rather enjoyable. But despite the comedic moments, the underlying story is so depressing. This woman has missed opportunity after missed opportunity as does Alex Stewart and while they finally find their way together at the age of 52, they suffer 3 collective failed marriages and nearly 40 years separated by the Atlantic. I can't help but think how much happiness was squandered b/c neither was courageous enough to throw caution to the wind."
4,Intimate and entertaining story.,"The intimate format of reading Rosie Dunne's emails and letters over the course of her life makes you truly feel as though you are a part of her story. Ahern creates the correspondence so cleverly that you often forget about the unconventional format in which her book is written. It does tend to drag in parts, but I think that only adds to real-life feeling of the book. The story also has a very predictable ending, but there are many plot twists throughout the story that keep you interested. You can guess the ending right away, but that is not the point of this book - the point is to fall in love with Rosie!Not quite as wonderful as ""PS I Love You"", but still a great read."
2,Sooo irritating,"Let me start out by saying that I think Cecelia Ahern is a brilliant writer--extremely talented. This book, however, was just torture. I enjoyed it for maybe the first 100 pages. The next hundred made me feel irritated, and by 300, I was skimming. I think the concept of all correspondence might work as a shirt story, but to make it into a novel in length, she just had to pad it with stuff the reader isn't really interested in. What we are interested in is getting Rosie and Alex together, and that plot--the main plot--is like Chinese water torture to our souls."
5,Same Book As Where Rainbows End: Pleasantly Surprised!,"I wasn't sure how I would feel about this book after reading P.S. I love you and then seeing how this book was written, which is sort of a letter back and forth, then emails back and forth, followed by instant messages back and forth...surprisingly though, I fell in love with this book! I couldn't put it down! I did get caught up in the drama of Alex & Rosie and longed for them to be together and something inside of me sparked wishing I had a childhood friend like that where through the years you know they'll always be there and you can count on them! I laughed reading this book out loud because the humor is so cute and at just the perfect moments. You wont be disappointed in this book, which is a quick read!"
3,Not the best,"The story idea is a good one, but I think it could have been written out better. By the middle of the book I couldn't wait to get through all the boring stuff just to see if they got together. If the book wasn't on my Kindle I would have thrown it across the room. I don't think this is one I will reread."
5,Life keeps getting in the way!,"Rosie and Alex are meant for each other. And yet life keeps getting in the way. Follow the pair through letters, notes, instant messages, and emails. Laugh at their correspondence with each other and with their friends and family.These childhood friends become long distance pen pals when Alex moves from Dublin to Boston. Plans to reunite are constantly thwarted. College happens, then marriage, births, and deaths. And yet they keep in touch. Watch Alex and Rosie grow from childhood to middle age and find out if fate helps them finally get together."
3,Choke cable for an old pick up truck,"I'm building a street rod with a manual choke. I bought this cable and took a close look at it before installation. The cable works, but has no angle mounting bracket, which I will fabricate myself so it will actually mount under my dash. The knob looks like it was hand filed by someone in a far away Chinese sweat shop. Not how a molded plastic part should look."
3,A Good Read (between the lines),"If you can subtract out the venom dripping from nearly every sentence, you'll get an insight into a few of the forces that shaped the Nazi tide. If Stern hadn't been so ridiculously hateful towards these long-dead ""proto-Nazis"" it would have been an excellent read.But any serious student of the NS time will have to balance this and many other works describing many other lead-up/ins to the '30s. The Nazis and their influences are a study in quantum schizophrenia, with ol' Uncle Adolf (sorta) riding herd. And of course the only thing weirder than the Nazis and all their braided streams of influence is the tangled, overgrown paths back to them through the historical literature."
1,HORRIBLE GAME!!!!,"Don't buy this game. I thought it would be like Shogun Total War which is an old PC game, but I was terribly disappointed! This game is no fun at all. I took over half of Japan in about 15 minutes, no kidding!!! If I would have kept going I could have beat it in an hour, but I took it back to the store instead. DO NOT BUY!!!!"
2,Shogun empires,"If your a strategy fan you will not like this game.There is no managment of your land at all just chose were to attack, repeat."
1,"No strategy, no challenge, no fun","What a waste of time! I just bought this game yesterday, looking for a solid strategy game, and found none on it. As already stated, it's a very poor and lame strategy wanna be game. Too easy, too short and no challenge at all. Nice cover, but that's all. It's not even worth the 7 bucks I paid for it."
3,It's okay...,I thought it might be similar to Ages Of Empires - but it isn't. It just isn't very exciting.
5,Durable toy,"Bought this for my 15 mos old nephew. He loves it! It is a very durable toy, gets washed a lot due to its bill and head being chewed! ;) Also, safe because the eyes are sewn in."
1,wrong discs inside,"I ordered this item 3 times from 2 different sellers and each time the set contained two copies of ""Battles for Tunisia"" andno copy of ""El Alamein"". It was extremely frustrating, and obviously is the fault of the supplier."
2,Africa,"The battle for the Mediterranean was excellent. They gave a good account by all sides with the missteps by the Italians, Germans and British. The thoughts andprocesses and how they came up with the battle plans made for an interesting program. El Alamein is a different story. There was so much repetition of subject matter that one could walk away for 20 minutes and not miss a thing. The Battles for Tunisia also had some repetition in it but not as bad as El Alamein. I say save your money and buy the single disc for The Battle for the Mediterranean."
3,Interesting,The book has some interesting suggestions. It was recommended by my doctor. I do like some of the ideas but I feel like it starts out strong and enlightening but then leaves you hanging with the same old rhetoric.
2,OK read,This was an OK read...much of what's already out there. Didn't rock my world as I had hoped.
2,WIDE BUT PROPERLY SIZED,"Nice looking shoe and should be comfortable but not properly sized for wide women's feet. The heel is much too wide - one reason that women with wide feet can't just buy men's shoes is because the heels are too wide. Too bad, cost me a lot of shipping and handling money to find out,"
2,not right for me,"There is something on the inside of the sneaker that is causing callouses on the sides of my feet. Something rubbing, I guess. They kind of hurt the first few times I wore them. I thought after I broke them in they would be better. But I've worn them for about 2 months now and they still kind of hurt.And the laces are too short."
3,"Good, but not great.","The product itself wasn't as high of quality as I would have liked or expected. My previous experience with K-Swiss shoes has been great, but this pair did not particularly impress me. There seemed to be rough cuts made on the shoe and the quality wasn't great. Overall, I would give it a 3 out of 5 stars."
4,Great quality and support but long shoe!,"Hi.I'm exchanging my 8 1/2 mediums in this shoe for an 8 medium. This shoeis great because it's all white (hard to find) and has a very HIGH toe boxso there is room for your toes! It is a naturally wide shoe - no need to orderwides (for me)...and I have a wide foot. However my usual 8 1/2 size in thisshoe was nearly an inch to long, so I'm exchanging it for an 8 medium. I neverwear 8s! Great support inside, heavy, but sturdy - will last a lifetime,one swish with a wet cloth and they look as good as new!"
2,Ambiguous and Dull,"My work with this book has been reduced to memorizing the various characters that come with the book. The exercises, while plentiful, would be a lot more helpful if they stuck to helping the reader learn characters that it had introduced, rather than characters containing the radicals it teaches. I can't imagine I'd have accomplished much if I hadn't already been familiar with many of the meanings of the characters from my work with Japanese. The cultural points made in the book are too few and far between. Overall, making through later chapters becomes drudgery. Perhaps 'Teach Yourself Chinese' is better?"
2,Most Poorly Bound Book I've Ever Bought,"The content is alright, but I'm giving this book a poor rating because of how horribly it is bound. I got this book only three days ago and today it is literally falling apart. I mean there are about fifteen pages coming out right now. I'm a bibliophile and not one to mistreat my precious books, so it is not due to any fault of mine that this book is falling apart; it is just terribly bound. It's like they took Elmer's glue to hold the pages together. Oh my God it is so bad...The content is okay, but good luck opening it for the first time without twenty pages flying out.I wish more of these language books would come in hardcover."
3,Against the Ropes,"Soon after the album was released in February 1980, Uriah Heep was in such a funk that songwriter and keyboardist Ken Hensley left and the band broke up (only to reform two years later).With John Sloman on lead vocals and Chris Slade on drums, the eight original tracks (five bonus tracks are included) again found the group trying to carve a niche in the AOR playlist that dominated FM radio. No Return, Carry On and Imagination are the better attempts at a ""new"" sound, while bassist Trevor Bolder emerges as a songwriter; co-writing two songs and also writing a pair, the strongest being It Ain't Easy.Though it received mostly negative reviews and was later panned by guitarist Mick Box and Hensley, this is a shining example of a band trying to find traction on a slippery slope of reinventing itself while maintaining an ambitious schedule of releasing new material and touring. It works in parts, but Uriah Heep was against the ropes and ultimately had to take time off to fully regroup."
4,A Must Read,"I recommend this novel. It is the first of Caryl Phillip's books that I've read for some time and I am so pleased to find that his novel ""Higher Ground"" was not a one-off.The book explores old age, racial prejudice, life outside the perceived norm.It is a tale told by two people - two very different people who have in common a loneliness and a compassion that they can find no real outlet for. There's Dorothy - a 50+ ex high school teacher. A divorcee from a working class background. A woman not anchored in the 21st century. And Gabriel/Solomon - a 30 year-old exile from an unnamed African country. They meet briefly. The novel is their shared and individual stories. Read it!"
2,Pain Free or Die,"Why would anyone these days recommend bovine cartilage when that is where mad cow disease resides? That recommendation and the bone soup recipe make me wonder if the author is part of the movement surrounding a certain cookbook/lifestyle book that has a huge following, but cites mainly other materials by that author and includes in the first chapter a non-factual critique of Pritikin's life and death. The online critiques of that book are quite thorough; I'm afraid I've entirely erased it from my mind, however."
1,Be careful,"Want thank you Charles Mertz for making me aware of the history of Sherry A. Rogers. I had to wonder almost 18 books from 1990 to 2009, then I realized she/organization owns Prestige Publishing company. Two years ago I got the monthly newsletter for $40/year. All her books and newletters are repeated stuff. She is a saleslady but look, its working and people are going for it, didn't for me after years of trying. All I ask is for people to be careful, your money buys her more years of continuing this."
4,Mother of two from Iowa,I bought this book after hearing Carol Kent speak at a Mother's conference. It is very easy reading and provides you with short inspirational stories about Mother's. Bible verses are referenced for each individual story to find more inspiratation. I thoroughly enjoyed this light reading.
3,"Good information, poor illustrations","I used this text as a supplement for my microbial physiology class and found the explantions good, if not complete. The problem I had was that the graphic representations used to show varying processes were either very lacking, or completely absent. Most good science texts use detailed illustrations and colored ink. This text provides neither and would probably serve the more experienced bacterial physiologist as a good reference."
3,required for school,I had to order the book for class. It was pretty helpful and informative. Better than the book they use now.
3,Not for idiots - PhD's only!,"Let's be serious - this is a very advanced book. The first few chapters fit well with the ""Idiot"" theme: these are the rules of chess, the queen moves like this, here's how you win the game, your basis Chess 101 topics. But watch out! By chapter 7 the author is walking the reader through 20-move sequences from historical Grandmaster matches. In the span of 7 chapters, the reader is working on his Master's degree in Chess. This is fine, if you want to move that quickly. But if you are even considering a book with the word ""idiot"" in the title, I would argue that there must be a much better alternative out there. This is not a Chess 101 book!"
3,Better design needed!,"While GM Wolff does a very good job of explaining concepts, the layout of the book leaves alot to be desired. A lot of times the examples he was referring were on the next page, AFTER the text describing them. It would have been better to have the diagrams before the text describing the concept at hand. I found it very difficult to have to continually flip pages to find the diagram being discussed.This is probably not a flaw of GM Wolff's design but the Complete Idiot's folks.Other than that, I thought it was a very good read and did an outstanding job of reinforcing and refreshing my skills. I purchased based on recommendation for adult beginners/novices. An excellent book to continue with is Heisman's ""Everybody's 2nd Chess Book."""
5,"A guide for all idiots, beginner and advanced.","Given the vast graveyard of beginning chess books authored bythe game's grandmasters, including those written by their ghosts(e.g., ""Lessons in Chess,"" by Garry Kasparov and the KasparovChess Academy), these most accomplished of players would bewell advised to heed the adage ""those who can do, those whocan't teach"" -- with the exception of Patrick Wolff.This book not only educates and entertains the aspiring player,but relates enough of the International Grandmaster's personalexperience and candid opinions to make it an interesting readfor the more accomplished player. Over a lifetime of playingchess and reading dry and mistake-ridden chess books, this isnot only the best beginner-type book I've come across, but oneof the better chess books, period.Tim Sweeney (tnsweeney@aol.com)"
1,Made me fee like an idiot,"Well, I feel like an idiot since I feel I could have done a better job writing this book. My issue is that it is written with an assumption that you with a minimual amount of information you can grasp everything - then move on to the next step without sufficient explanation. So what did I do, get another book on the basics. And boom! It did the job - Chess For Dummies wasn't it - it was Learn Chess Volumes One and Two by Alexander and Beach. These British chaps knew how to teach beginners with a reasonable IQ."
3,Not Enought Information,"This is the first book I've purchased on this subject, and it turned out to be more of a ""picture book"" than I had expected. Although the pictures are beautiful, I would have preferred more written information to be included.Overall, it's probably not a bad ""first"" book to have on Pompeii, but a bit more written info. would have been nice."
5,Marcia SHINES,"Marcia Hines is one of Australia's best kept secrets. Arrived in Australia when she was 16 to star in the musical HAIR, and stayed. From there she became the Queen of Pop for several years during the 70's. While her career has been up and down, all her singles were well received. The 70's were the highlight of her career delivering hits like 'You', 'Something's Missing In My Life' and the excellent cover of James Taylor's 'Fire & Rain'. In 1982, she released a song called 'Your Love Still Brings Me to My Knees' which has become a gay icon song in recent years. This compilation is definitive, and no hit has been overlooked. A must-have album! We were lucky she decided to stay with us."
1,Horrible experience!,I would give a half star but you can't! The table that I got was scratched and the box came opened. The chairs was poorly made! When I called cust. service no one picked up. I tried to email and didn't get response! Buyer BEWARE!
5,more color than you can imagine,I love these color pencils. I have been using them for years and when I saw this great deal on a set of 132 I couldn't resist. These pencils can be easily blended and layered. if you are an artist who likes using pencils and color pencils I suggest you try these. They are soft and do crumble easy so be gentle with them. but I have never found a color pencil that matches the vividness of these pencils.
5,Great brand of colored pencils,"I can't say that Prismacolor colored pencils are as good as they were long ago, before they moved shop to Mexico (the wood seems softer-- almost spongy, which can sometimes make for sharpening issues), but overall, it's still a great brand of colored pencils with a color selection unmatched by anyone else. It's nice to start out with a large set like this, see which colors you use most, and then sort of pare-down to the essentials (and for everyone, it will be different) I got my first set when I was about 14 and have been using them for almost 30 years now-- Get your fixative while you shop, btw, because if you are heavy-handed in your use, you will need to use some to prevent bloom--(BTW, not sure why this is listed under ""toy""-- I know of many, many professional artists that use this brand!)"
