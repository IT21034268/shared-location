1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"Don't waste your time or money.If I could have given a minus star, I would have.The product started to fail on day one, and didn't make it to day three. First the protective sheild over the diode fell off, and then the components apparently shifted and shorted out. I emailed for an RMA, and then realized it would cost more in my time and gas to send the d*mn thing back (I live in VT and the nearest UPS drop box is 30 miles round-trip.) Amazon shouldn't sell items of this (non)-quality."
3,Only for USB and SD cards NOT mp3 players and not very user friendly,"The sound quality is very poor if you are connecting a mp3 player. But is good for SD cards and USB's.The connector is not very good so a slight touch will restart the transmitter and then you again have to set the frequency. It would have been great if the transmitter could retain the frequency setting on restart.You cant use the mp3 player so using an SD card to an Mp3 player makes it difficult as it goes back to the start of your playlist after every restart of the transmitter. So even for stopping the car at a gas station, you have to listen the songs from the start or manually go to the selected song."
1,Never recommmend this to your friends...,"i do not even have a chance to use it because this device only ""on"" for 10 sec on the first song of my USB and this device just shut off and never able to on it again, fuse is good. so the only reason is this device have some hardware problem. do not even think of return this to the seller as you will need to pay for some misc fee and shipping handle fee too, do not worth it for this price. better to get a good device rather than having this bad experience and waste of money."
3,Useful,"I purchased this product when my car CD player ceased to operate and I didn't want to be forced to listen to the radio only. My car does not have a AUX jack, so rather than purchase an Ipod with an FM transmitter (pricey) I used this device. It does take time to find a frequency that has optimal sound, and there is SOME static at all times. The only downfall is that you are unable to fast forward/rewind songs and takes forever to scroll to the song you want. Also sometimes, when I turned the engine off, it would reset and begin playing from the first song in the playlist, then you have to scroll through to get back to the song you were on. Sometimes pausing before you shut off the car helps this problem."
1,A toy,"This is a toy at best. It has no playback functions except ""play"", ""next track"", and ""previous track"": no shuffle/random or any other features. Also it doesn't work well, dropping the connection (to the FM radio) every few minutes and starting the track over from the beginning. Finally, the sound quality is inferior to CDs, not surprising since it's broadcasting over FM radio. A waste of money."
3,Cheap for a reason,"There's no denying that the price on these things is very affordable. Unfortunately, you get what you pay for. This is actually the 4th one of these that I have purchased in the past year. That sounds pretty shoddy, but with how frequently I use it and how cheap I got it for, it's really not a bad deal. Just be prepared for it to go out on you after a few months of use.The past 2 that I bought have kind of ticked me off though. Unlike the first 2 that I owned, these newer units will not remember which song you were on when you turned off your car. Having to reset your frequency and skip through your music library every time you turn on your car can make this very impractical for short trips. But like I said, at least the price is good."
3,Only lasted a month,Its difficult to recommend this product since it quit working only about a month after I got it. I was also never able to get it to play music off of the SD card. I could only get the player off the internal memory. The Remote control worked without any problems. Please also be aware that this device transmits audio with an low power FM transmitter. This is great for convenience but not good for audio quality. No FM transmitters that I have used have been very good at delivering good audio quality. If your thinking of buying a device with these features I would suggest buying something more expensive that has better build quality.
3,OK for the price,"Works OK, frequent interference and noise as it catches the signal from FM stations off the air. One thing that hurts my usage of trying to play audio books is that it can only resume from start of a track."
2,Junk,"It worked great at first and it was very to use with a SD card which I also purchased with this item. However, this thing periodically works now. Seems theres some kind of shortage and you have to fiddle with it for it to sometimes work. Nice idea, cheap product."
1,I'm glad it was cheap because it was a waste of money.,"This thing is made so cheaply that it broke the second time I tried to use it. When I first pulled it out of the package, I knew it probably wouldn't last long. It felt sort of thin and fragile. If you decide to purchase this, do not attempt to use the headphone jack to plug in your phone or MP3 player. The part that you plug into broke off inside the device, which then shorted something out so that it doesn't work even if I use the card slot or USB. I know it was inexpensive but I thought I would get to use it more than once. Very disappointing, to say the least."
1,no bass sound,"you are not going to hear,any bass sound with this device.if you can pay five dollars more for something better, do it."
4,great product for the price!,"For the price, this is a great product! I needed to play mp3s in my car and was considering getting a car sound system installed, but then i decided to try this. it's pretty simple to use, and you can plug in any USB flash drive into it. The sound quality is decent enough and there's no interference. only downside is that you have to step through the list of songs by clicking the next button, so if you want to find song number 501 it's going to take forever! :)"
1,Utter Junk,"Cheap, nasty, made in China rubbish. You know that phrase ""blink and you'll miss it""?, well try and blink as you land on this description page. To even entertain the notion that this item 'once sold for over $100' (as is suggested) you'd need a day release form from your mental specialist. It's not even worth the $9 they're asking for it now. Landfill ahoy!!"
2,Great idea but poor quality work,"The idea behind this product was great! However when I received the product, the socket for the MP3 player was broken. It was pushed to the inside of the unit, leaving a useless hole there. So I can just use either the SD Card or thumbdrive slots. I give the two stars for these. If they can improve on the the quality and durability of this product, that will do justice to the idea. But who can be assured of that now? Don't gamble on this."
2,Bare minimum...Its not Stereo,"Got this product before 4 july , so I have used it over holiday travel. Only one good things1. Works with songs in folder, outside folder even when the usb have other filesLots of shortcomings:Additional to other reviews, biggest short coming(They all are true and quite frustating, when we actually use the product)It does not transmit in stereo, so playback quality is much like playing a 1950's radio at best.I have VR3 one earlier, that was much better."
2,No vale la pena,"creia que valdria la pena pero uno se desencanta rapidamente debido a que es un poco dificil de manejar y la fiebre por uso se le pasa a uno rapidamente, ademas se daño muy rapido ya que repite una cancion cuantas veces le da la gana y uno adelanta la proxima cancion y pone la misma otra vez. igual pasa con las carpetas."
1,"Simple, but Worst Sound Quality","This product barely does what it's supposed to do, i.e. allow you to listen to your stored music via your car's FM radio. I used the transmitter correctly, and tried every FM station-- but the sound quality was always so poor. I didn't expect CD quality or anything; even 8-track quality would've sufficed! But it wasn't even that good.I only spent $6 for this thing and I *still* feel ripped off. That's how bad it is."
1,Please do not buy,"I was looking for a bargain FM transmitter, and I regret this purchase. Evidently the seller also knows how bad it is as they refuse to reply to my e-mail asking why the thing won't even work. The device is shoddily made and will look close to broken the minute you take it out of the package. Its ability to transmit a station is so poor, I would actually label this product as a Static Noise Transmitter. It is so bad, it is unusable, even if you have a decent amount of tech savvy or are willing to really try hard to position it so that you can get a clear station... for like 10 seconds (tops). Awful purchase."
2,Not a perfect Item,This item doesn't work clear. I used in my car its sound is not clear. This item doesn't have the same effect as regular car stereo. I wouldn't recomend this item to any buyers.
5,Great!,"This book is great at teaching you how to elicit people's values (ie, what they want, and how they know when they get it). This allows you to much better understand people with whom you are dealing, and gives you the power to please and connect with them in ways that most people would miss. The techniques are simple, involving asking a number of targeted questions. The best thing about the book is that it includes many examples, so you can really ""observe"" the techniques working."
5,Best how-to sales book I've read!,"If you want to learn how your customer makes buying decisions, this is the book to read. Take one chapter at a time, read it carefully, and PRACTICE the questioning technique, then go on to the next. Sadovsky really helps you get inside your customer's head to help them get what they want--from you!"
1,"yuck - unlikeable, racist author","I came away from this with a very bad taste in my mouth. I don't find Mrs. Moodie very likeable at all. Her racism toward the Irish is really offensive, even judging her by the standards of her own day. The rest of the book is so-so -- some of the frontier experiences are interesting, but I found her personality so unlikeable that I cheered when her house caught fire."
5,beautiful valve covers,these covers are gorgeous and really look great on the car. they were also a great price. glad I got them.
5,lots a luck,"first of all, suzaan summers, spelt wrong i know, is not in this. and. This is a great show. I do not remember it when i was a kid, but I am a big fan of Dom Deluise. He is fanastic in. buy this, it is wonderful, all the supporting cast are fantastic."
1,Guitar Songbook,"An expensive book for what you get. Although it has many popular songs that you know. Many of the songs' guitar chords are incorrect and strumming technique was not what the famous artist used. Simply put... except for the melody notes, many of the music is wrong.Good beginner book though."
1,Wow! What a Rip Off!,"This book is a complete waste of money. Half of the chords listed are just wrong. I tried playing the book version along with the real version on cd, and was pretty upset to find the two were completely different. Also, the melody written is not the guitar part, it's the vocal part. So if you don't want to play chords and only want to play the vocal parts with your guitar, this book may be okay for you. If not, I suggest checking out some real sheet music. Don't waste your time and money on this garbage."
3,Ok but not many artists,This book is ok. It really focuses on Bob Dylan music (which is kinda strange cause the description really does not tell that). Music is fairly easy to read but there are some noticable errors. THere are some songs in this book that I have yet to find anywhere else so I guess in that sense it was worth it. It is not spiral bound which is very annoying as the book does not want to stay open on a music stand.
2,"Complete Guitar Player Songbook, Omnibus Ed. 2","""I was disappointed in this edition. The open book depicted on the cover suggests there is detailed strumming information for each song, as was the case with the earlier books, but instead there is only a very small graphic showing the strum pattern. I thought the picture on the cover was misleading."""
2,Language delights; denouement does not.,"Graham Greene's mastery of diction and description is evidenced in the first 180 pages of this book. The ending, however, is rife with histrionics; it's a cheap out to an otherwise engaging read. Though some may equate this with Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" (and Greene properly chastises the reader for this mental comparison), Greene does not rise to Conrad's stature."
2,Mid-life crisis stinker from briliant writer,"Imagine this for a plot:Unable to withstand his immense popularity with young, married women in Europe, and heartily bored of his work, the misunderstood aging Artist flees to Africa. He wanders up the Congo before settling down at a leper colony, where the quaint Catholic missionaries adopt him into their fold and allow him to be himself: moody, introspective, and manly.Soon, a parade of jealous fools makes him their hero, until a young woman married to an expatriate factory manager falls in love with the Artist, liver spots and all. Hijinks ensue, and the Artist withstands the rigors of public scrutiny by retreating into stoic posturing.I won't reveal the end.Basically, if it weren't for Greene's skillful prose, this book would be an absolute stinker. As it is, it earns only 2 stars. I recommend this book only to die-hard Greene fans. For those looking for a better Greene novel, start with ""The Quiet American,"" which is an excellent book."
4,mixed feelings,"Very readable, quite trashy. All melodrama, funny how in youth it might have seemed profound, now riddled with casual racism and trite nihilism. Still he could tell a story that greene."
2,Not his best by any stretch,"Tough read that ultimately fails. A celebrated architect retreats from the world by moving to a Leprosarium in the middle of the Congo. His rebellion against himself and society seems like an attempt to show him as a better Catholic than a true Catholic. The religious angle is interesting but SO played out in Greene books -- he uses it to a much better affect in his other works. The character of the leper Deo Gratias (yeah really, he went THAT far) is particularly grating.Unless you're a hardcore fan, you can pass this one up without missing anything."
4,Great Workout!,"This DVD is not for beginners. It is fairly tough if you give it 100% If you are looking for something that burns alot of calories in a short amount of time, develops muscle strength, and improves skills, this DVD is for you. Not the best production quality and kind of goofy but it works."
1,WHO THE *$$#*^!! TITLED THIS BOOK????,"""photographs of the masters""?????? there are no pictures of miles davis, charlie parker, duke ellington, john coltrane, eric dolphy, lester bowie, don cherry, keith jarrett, thelonious monk, chet baker, paul desmond and more. if those aren't the names of masters, then i'm the king of englandnow what kind of bull**** on a stick is that???????????"
2,"Drop the price, please!","I'd be more inclined to buy this if the price were about 10-12 bucks lower - 30 bucks for a short DVD like this is not quite worth it to me.and $25 to watch it online? how 'bout $12.99? It's only an hour long! I'm a huge fan of Aaron Rosand and everything he did on the violin, and have been for 20+ years, and I know he still teaches even though he's retired. If the publisher can find it in their hearts to take a little less revenue, I'll purchase. This is all very disappointing because Ray Chen is a truly remarkable young violinist whose playing directly reflects his teaching from Rosand - as those of us who know Rosand's artistry well, can attest to. And it would be nice to be able to see that teaching for a reasonable price. Perhaps the producer/manufacturer of this video feels that it's worth the price they're asking, but they need to make their prices competitive or they won't see much in the way of profit. Oh well. I hope someday I do get to see this."
5,EDUCATIONAL & FUN!!!,"As a preschool teacher for many years, I ordered this along with some others for our 'outer space' unit. It almost didn't get ordered because I thought it sounded too technical for 3 to 5 yr olds. Wow, what a surprise! It explains everything in extremely kid friendly terms, in an order that makes sense. It uses actual footage & computer animation, detailed enough but not scary. The kids want to watch it over & over. Preschoolers to adults will love this video. It's a keeper!"
4,Very engaging (and accurate),"Since this is a documentary style, it is real and accurate. My 6 year old granddaughter was fascinated. My blind grandson (7 year old) enjoyed it because of all the real sounds/noises, especially the LAUNCH sequences. We have been learning about the solar system together, so this is one DVD in our new collection of space DVDs. Very well done. Since I work for NASA, naturally I enjoyed it."
5,My 3 year old loves this,This is a wonderful video. My (just about to turn) 3 year old loved it. Right now she really wants to go to space and I have been looking for a video she can enjoy that won't make my brain leak out of my ears. Both of us enjoyed it and I look forward to watching it with her again and again.
3,"Fun and educational , but production values could be better","I enjoyed this video with a three and five year old. It kept the three year old's attention, and to a lesser extent, also the five year old's. I'm no film expert, but it did strike me that, in some ways, the sound and picture quality could be more polished. I think I was just expecting more because the video was so highly rated here on Amazon. Nonetheless, it was enjoyable, and the three year old mentioned that he would like to go to space camp like the kids in the video."
5,Awesome!!!,My son is 3 1/4 years old and recently began taking a liking to Rocket ships...he has always been a train/car/dinasour fan but has branched out a bit in recent months. I bought this DVD along with a book on space and the Matchbox Space Shuttle toy system for Christmas. He loves all of them. This DVD documents everything from the Shuttle to the basics of Space and puts it in simple terms with animation and kids voices that keeps the kids entertained and doesn't bore the adults! As an adult I have learned more about the space shuttle from this DVD!! We have watched is numerous times over the past weekend since we got it! My son then speaks of some of the facts as he is playing with his toy shuttle..very educational and fun! I would highly recommend this for kids of many ages - from 3-13!! and even great for those of use over 30!!
5,Engaging for the whole family,"This DVD is loved by our 2.5yr old, 10 month old son, and their 36 year old father. It has engaging video, graphics, and music. It also has an appropriate and thoughtful tribute to the Columbia and her crew."
5,Shocked by toddler's interest,"I watched this with my 3 yr old & 2 yr old sons. It is technical enough to interest an adult, yet they were just glued to the TV the entire time!They would watch it all day if I allowed it.The video has multiple narrators, both children, males & females. I think that keeps their interest. It also bounces quickly from one topic to the next. It discusses space camp, astronaut training, experiments in space & much more. It seems a tad dated to the adult, but kids don't pick that up. It gives all kinds of facts that you will assume are rolling right over your toddler's head until he looks up into the night sky & states ""maybe we can see the shuttle...it's 180 miles up from the ground"" Then they will put their toy logs together & ""drop their booster rockets when the fuel is used up"" & send their toy boats to save them from the ocean depths. Amazing.Highly recommend. I only wish there were more quality children's videos like this available."
4,The Emerald Isle,I loved this book and engaged with it right away. Cahara was a great character. Looking forward to other stories in this genre. Thank you
3,"Love the series, but this is the weakest one","This is a great series. As others have said, quick reads, interesting plotlines, a good dose of history. The fourth, however, is the hardest to get into. The first 100 pages are slow moving and the plotline of Kathleen's silly obsession with Taylor is well....silly. Still worth reading."
5,Great Conclusion to Series!,Hunt nicely wraps up the contemporary story of Kathleen O'Connor who travels to Ireland to research the story of Cahira O'Connor. She blends a great framework for both stories and gives the reader a unique ending to the love story that began her writing and in her own life.
2,Avoid this shoulder rest,Its cheap in every aspect.My daughter decided she would rather not use a shoulder rest than use this shoulder rest.The vinyl covered foam was very uncomfortable for her. Our violin instructor just couldn't find a way to make it comfortable.The grip (part that connects to the violin) is covered with this plastic thing which is horrible and seems like its easy to slip off. If it does slip off you can guarantee scratches on your violin.We ended up buying a Kun violin rest which is great.
3,Super Bowl?,My grandson is a real Football fan and plays the game too. I found this super bowl package for him for Christmas. He was so excited when he opened his gift. However when we watched one of the DVD's we were both dissapointed. I was thinking I was purchasing DVD'S of the actual Super Bowl games. After all that is what the title says.
4,NFL America's Game Super Bowl I-XL,"The above DVD of the Super Bowl Games was not the one I had ordered, I tried to return it but was told the one I really wanted was not available thru Amazon, had to go thru Warnwer Brothers. So I kept since it was a Christmas gilf. My grandson has enjoyed very much"
3,America's Game from Amazon network,"Product arrived quickly, which I appreciated. However I *stongly* suspect it was used and repackaged. Slight wear on box of boxed set didn't bother me too much. Signs of wear on actual DVDs did."
2,Interesting,A quick read and decent insights but not something I would recommend to lovers of essay.
3,Did anybody else notice,"...that ""Sweet Lullaby's"" haunting tone progressions are ""borrowed"" from Al di Meola's ""African Night"" (Scenario, 1983)? I like what Deep Forest did with their source material, but I hate that there's not even a tip 'o the hat to di Meola and Jan Hammer the composers of ""African Night."" Anyway, if you like early fusion, di Meola is a masterful guitarist you might enjoy."
2,deep forest music cd,I was told the condition was very good but some there are several gashes in the cd and playing the 1 title is impossible. Slightly disapointed but I believe this version is hard to find or at least a lot more expensive without damage. Case is damaged too. Delivery was ok.
5,A must for any listening library,"Absolute must-have for a true music library. A solid, original, entrancing, and memorizing album."
4,GOOD CD,"The only music I love on this album is Deep Forest,Sweet Lullaby,Nightbird,Desert Walk and Sweet Lullaby(ambient mix).The other 5 track is little bit good."
1,Sweet Lullaby Is The Only Song I Like!,"I bought this CD when I heard Sweet Lullaby on my Pure Moods CD, well the only good song on this Deep Forest CD is Sweet Lullaby but since I have it already on my Pure Moods CD than it was a waste of money for me since I don't like any of these other songs, the rest of the songs are kind of too new agey or something for my personal tastes!"
2,"good music, but a cultural hoax!","I have to give this album at least 2 stars, because for sitting down and listening to new-age stuff, this one is not bad.My temptation is to give it even less due to the artists ongoing battle with their use of material that they did not have permission to use in this way. It is great that so many people in the world have been exposed through this album to some amazing sounds from the Solomon Islands-- but it is a shame that everyone thinks that it is African pygmy music. Don't believe me-- check out the article published in the journal 'Public Culture' volume 12. Shame on Deep Forest.If you want listen to this album for purely aural satisfaction, you'll probably enjoy it. If you are looking for true african pygmy sounds, for properly credited cultural explorations, or for responsible music makers that do not contribute to cultural primitivism-- look elsewhere."
2,Don't waste your money,"There is only one good song on this entire CD- track number 2- ""Sweet Lullaby"".The other songs have good beat and are down right boring.If you heard ""Sweet Lullaby"" on the radio back in the early nineties, and you think the other songs are just as good, you are sadly mistaken."
3,"Hey, it is what it is","Smooth like that whole early 90s ethno thing, and eminently listenable for chilled out background music a la Enigma and Brian Eno.New Age is bad jazz? OK, then jazz must be bad classical."
5,I always have a copy!,"I've listed & quickly sold this CD several times over the years, but unlike 99% of the music I sell, I keep a copy for myself. I no longer analyze why this ""story"" soothes me: as I drift off it turns into a dream. How cool is that!"
2,heavy and not so quiet as described,"I bought this compressor for the quiet operation that was described in amazon reviews, but it is just not that much quieter than the dewalt or hitachi and a lot heavier, so I am disappointed."
3,"Good, but not the best.","This film is ok, but the best Hitler documentary I have ever seen is Joachim C. Fest's ""Hitler A Career"". This film is very sad and not as good. ""Hitler A Career"" is far more enjoyable."
5,One of the Great Documentaries about WWII,"I have been watching documentaries about WWII since the early 50s and this one is among the best. It's detailed examination of the rise of Nazism within Germany answers many of the questions I've long had but never had answered by other documentaries. I was especially interested in the depiction of the Nazi attitude toward Eastern Europe. This is often overlooked in most documentaries about this war, and this film's treatment is unusually thorough. I was also very impressed by the many contemporary interviews with former Nazis. There is little else like it in other documentaries."
5,Eye opening documentary,Another fine production from the BBC. I saw this on Netflix instant play and liked it so much I had to buy it. It's chock full of understanding the many facets of the war as well as the origins.Never before had I seen such a deep delve into the origins of what occurred in Germany pre-1940 to precipitate the events of WWII.It is indeed a warning from history and we should not forget lest we repeat the mistakes of the day.
2,Nazi Book,"Not at all like his first book The White City, not as fictional style even though it is factual. A hard read for me, had to put it down."
1,overhyped time life commercials,"Television commercials sucked husband into wanting this DVD. He was very disappointed in what they led him to think was in the product. I have absolutely no problems with the seller, just was sad how this product did not live up to the hype. Beware!"
1,Very let down....,"I felt all this DVD did was create propaganda to vilify germany. It completely left out all the outside support for germany and further acted as if germany only discriminated against jewish people? I am not german but am very familiar with history and this seems more of a hollywood script than literal history of the time. Needless to say, avoid the DVD and wait for the movie, you will save $20."
4,can happen again,"those who don't know history tend to repeat it. unfortunately it seems to be happening again all over the world. I found the dvds to be very informative and added information I had not known before. The rise of Hitler to power was brought about by being in the right place at the right time, saying the right things. It is amazing how easily a nation can turn on itself ie against the Jewish population. Also how easily they believed they were intitled to the lands of other nations. This is probably not the best review ever written. Never wrote one before. But if you want to learn about the rise of Hitler and/or Nazism, this dvd set is an excellent start."
5,Sobering!,Every high school student should watch this lesson from history along with a history of the evils of the COMMUNIST Soviets under Stalin etc. These two corrupt governments are from the very pits of HELL!
3,Hitler and crowd,"A nice but superficial review, likely by necessity to fit it into the constraints of broadcast time, this production is most interesting in the interviews with those who were either participants or victims of that ghastly regime. What is fascinating is the unapologetic admission by some erstwhile Nazis that they were so attracted by the charisma of der Fuhrer that it is likely they would again succumb. Some discount their participation in carnage as not so reprehensible, attributing it to the process of war, a sentiment we encounter even today. The 1962 televison documentary based on William Shirer's The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich available still on VHS is a much more informative history."
5,Very nice piece of furniture,Pro:Was actually very pleased with the fact that this not only is a nice printer stand with lots of room for paper but actually looks like a nice piece of furniture.Worth the money I spent.Con:Arrived broken! The top of the stand was completely broken off. We glued it and it seems to be holding because that was easier then trying to go through the hassle of sending it back.
4,Much larger than expected,"Too big for one monitor, too small for two. Check the dimensions on this thing before ordering. In the picture, you see the two small slots on the top shelf? Each one can hold a ream of paper with the short side (8-1/2"") facing outward. Still, it is well made of real wood with a nice mahogany finish (more orange-ish than red-ish). Nice if you have mahogany office furniture."
5,Perfect,"I purchased this for my office and it is perfect. I have it on my credenza and my printer sits on top and I keep ""pending"" files under. It is very well made and went perfect with my desk."
4,"Beautimous Bakelite, but ...","This coffeetable collectable book about Bakelite and the Style of its time is beautiful and informative. But this memoir of the ""miracle material"" would have been even better in gloss, as with the brilliant patina of its subject, rather than matte.The reader is often jarred with syntactical reminders that the book was printed in China: ""No longer in demand for consumer goods, Bakelite returned mercurial career ending as it had begun"" [sic.] Say what?And then there is the horror: a Texas Chainsaw Massacre-type approach to test for true Bakelite. The author advises that a good way to tell if a piece is really Bakelite is to take a hacksaw or sandpaper to it! Please ignore this part of the book. Don't ruin the Bakelite! They don't make it any more! There are better Bakelite barometers!Aside from these admonitions, this is a big, broad, beautiful buffet, an overview and history of bygone eras' sumptuous stuff and practical products.TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer"
3,okay,"Though this book is flawed, the ""small"" European states are so often neglected it is nice to see someone looking at them."
3,"Disappointing follow up to ""Leaving Las Vegas""","Director Mike Figgis followed up his triumphant ""Leaving Las Vegas"" with this disappointing film.Wesley Snipes takes a rare (understandbly so) turn as a dramatic actor. Kinski attempts to resurrect her career (and fails). Only Ming Na Wen escapes unscathed from this vacuous ""drama"". Unfortunately, she is now voicing computer generated characters in ""Final Fantasy - Flop""."
3,"empty, maybe?","It seems a good story line, and yet it wasn't fully developed as a good movie at all. Yes, it makes sense for Wesley's charactor to be attracted to subtle and beautiful Kinski and leave his aggressive though not bad looking wife for good. But, is this the only reason, which was not explained well in the story. A empty story, maybe, but I guess the script is not that good after all. Robert Downey Jr. as a friend of Wesley's charactor and a guy dying of aids looks never so beautiful in his acting, whether on stage under the studio's lighting or on his death bed, which is among his best performances of his career, not to mention the best performance in this movie. It has some beautiful shots and good music though, if not for anything else."
3,Good acting but story gets way too unbelievable by the end,"The first half is a fascinating tale of self realization and the prospect of getting lost within one's own life. But then it falls into a tailspin with one too many coincidences. The acting is superb. One other thing to note, the movie deals exceptionally well with interracial relationships -- mainly it draws little to no attention to them and instead portrays cross-racial romances as commonplace. This should be commended because most other movies would stuff it down your throat."
4,Good Flick,"Well acted movie. Great job with the tension between all parties involved. Loved the ending--don't know what the guy from LA problem is, if you want a foursome-go rent a porno and get over it."
2,Lame,"It started out looking like it would be interesing although the trailer left me wondering - another 'man leaves family for a something different' movie? There was the non-depth of the characters that never sorted itself out. Why did this take so little thought or so very little emotion, I wondered. Then the acting. Karen - was this a really passive come on or just an undefined character? In the end you have her casting fond looks at her once-husband (played as well as the non-character chould be played) as she had earlier cast looks at Max and you wonder if it's about to happen all over again. And why did Max just suddenly wake up one day and find his energetic, explosive wife with personality so uncomparable to the limp Karen who has silent orgasms? The ending is no surprise at all even though they really give it a very obvious try to be clever. Lame. I give it 2 stars rather than one for for the orange story's presentation by Charlie."
1,Waste of Time & Money!!!!!!1,This is one of the worse films ever done..... What was Wesley thinking playing in this movie??? It truly doesn't give a good representation to multiracial relationships.
1,not a good movie to watch,This movie was not good when i first watch it. Why would wesley snipes recommend his character have an asian wife and then cheat on his wife by having a one night stand with a lady he doesn't even know. Why would you leave your wife who has two kids for you for another person and vice versa. Wesley Snipes Adn Ming-Na is one of my favorite actor and actrees but them acting in this movie is not one of my favorites.
5,Great Movie!,"Nastassja Kinski is on her best, the story is fascinating and malicious! A must see!!!!!!!"
2,Interesting film.,"Not really good, not bad. Interesting. Downey's performance was excellent and heartbreaking. He amazes me with his versatility. He can be totally silly, like in Friends and Lovers, or utterly brilliant, like in Restoration, which is a masterpiece, and everything in between. The man is a superb actor. He was definately the shining star in this one, although his part was small."
3,Great... but still not that good,"Divididos' first album presents (as usual) a wide range of different styles. From the opening song 'Camarón Bombay,' which has a certain latin vibe to it, the band goes through 13 songs (11, actually, since Camarón Bombay is featured three times), each special in its own way. From funky tracks to heavy riffs, and going through an awesome cover of 'Light My Fire,' by The Doors. Songs like 'Ché Qué Esperas?,' 'La Mosca Porteña' or 'Light My Fire' itself prove the band's greatness, but still, the album is far from being their best. The songs are not fully convincing, and, what's worse, the sound given to the tracks is not always great, and the mixes sometimes make an astounding song turn average."
2,Cheap for a reason,"This is cheap for its capacity, but the padding on both the shoulder and waist straps is significantly inferior to that of well-known brands. I upgraded to a Lowe Alpine Sirocco after suffering with this backpack for a six week backpacking trip, and the difference in comfort is huge.In addition, my torso is definitely less than 24"" but after adjusting the shoulder strap connector for the longest torso length the hip straps still only come down to my waist.On the plus side it came with a suitably sized raincover, and seemed pretty sturdy."
5,Wunderbar,"Wunderbar - fabulous! It's a great story anyway and reading it in German gives a new feel to it. The story and language are simple enough to make reading this book relaxing and enjoyable.Other great books in German areMax und Moritz: eine Bubengeschichte in sieben Streichen (German Edition)andDie Biene Maja und Ihre Abenteuer (German Edition), both of which were originally written in German and became worldwide bestsellers.See my list ""Great German Books""."
5,Great Book,I bought the book for my German class and it arrived in a timely mannor. The book was in the condition that the revier said (new) and I throurly enjoyed the book.
4,good book,"This is a really good little kids book. I ordered it for my nephew who lives in Germany, and we can read together when he visits this fall. I would recommend this book for all little boys."
4,Interesting Book!,This book is interesting but contains a confusing use of Vietnamese words. It would have been better to use English translations right along with the Vietnam words. I am hoping to please my Vietnamese students who can identify with the story and understand the vocabulary.
1,"DONT BUY ,PIECE OF GARBAGE","WHAT A PEICE OF GARBAGE.BOUGHT FOR MY KID, FOR HER TRIP TO IRELAND.STARTED SMOKING FIRST TIME SHE USED IT.RATE THIS ITEM WITH NO STARSHAD TO GIVE AT LEAST 1 STAR TO LEAVE MY OPINIONSAVE YOUR MONEY. THIS PRODUCT FIRE HAZAD"
4,Good product and quick delivery,"We went to Europe for 2 weeks, there was rain for the first week of the trip. We pretty much stayed in the room watching our DVD player using the converter and plugged the player straight into the plug. Unlike other review i had NO PROBLEMS!! No smoke, no popping sounds, this product was on every day for at least 5-6 hours for the first week and the second week it was on 2-3 hours a day.. Still working! I had bought a similar product last year when we went to Europe and it exploded on the 3rd day.. I am VERY happy with the converter kit and it cost very little too!"
2,Hmmmm....,"It worked...for most of the trip. My girls used it for 8 days with a 120v hair drier. It fried on the 9th day. Metled down...wasnt pretty. Would not stay in the Euro wall sockets very well. Had to hold it in place to keep it from falling out. Needs a cord set to plug into wall (like a laptop power converter does). I would have made one if I had known I needed it. This unit may have fried do to frequent bad connections (Falling out of the socket will do that) Anyway ,if you buy this,(or any model that looks like it) make a cord set for it and it may last years for all I know."
5,Uno de los libros m[as emocionantes que he leido,"Una novela de accion que va mas alla que cualquiera de las de su genero. Emocionante, angustiante y bien escrita. Una pieza de buena literatura."
2,This doe not compute,"The story line, delivered with a straight face, is completely unbelievable. The constant name dropping gets tiresome, especially if one gets the feeling that the author knows just the name but nothing behind it. The scenes in Berlin are primitive and often wrong. The style is that of an outline of a movie script. Hopefully, nobody will ever make that movie."
5,The best book on learning to deal in the art world!,"Lazzari, is an amazing artist, as well as writer. I used this book for a Gallery Managment course at El Camino College in Torrance, CA taught by Christian Mounger. While taking this course, we exhibited some of Lazzari's work's in our Gallery, and she gave an insightful lecture on this subject. It is excellent! I am still using it, and recommending it to others. It is well written, in sightful, and useful! A must have for all seaching a career in Art."
1,not worth the price,"I've read many art business books - and this one is on the bottom of the pile. While it was expected that the content would not be radically different, the format was boring, the text was basic, much of the advice seemed to date from the 70's (the difficulty of buying and renovating a warehouse loft? really?!?), and overall it was just not presented in an interesting or engaging manner.Save your money and keep searching.Try some of these:I'd Rather Be in the Studio!- one of the best books out there for artists!How to Survive and Prosper as an Artist: Selling Yourself Without Selling Your Soul- not bad, mostly lists and great links for searching other info.Business And Legal Forms for Fine Artists (3rd Edition)- must have to understand some of the legalities."
2,Not for a serious visual artist,"Sorry to disagree with Ms Lazarri's friends but this book should be accurately titled ""artist-lite"". It is strictly for an amateur - a Sunday painter - and not for an artist serious in pursuing a career in the visual arts.If this is how you define yourself then this is a book for you."
3,Don't tast like cheddar!,I like these things but I don't know why they call them Cheddar Fries. They would be better named Onion Fries because that is all you taste. One good thing is that they are not as salty as the Hot Fries.
1,eh?,I accidently picked these --- I really wanted the hot fries. These just are not as good. I guess if you like cheddar they are okay.
3,Where are these guys?,"This was a desperate attempt 2 repeat live& learn.You really can't blame them though(Why fix, if it's not broken?).The fact of the matter is every group or singer makes an album that tanks.In the early years you were given a chance 2 get over the hump, but in these times one bad album usually means you get dropped.I guess that's what happened 2 these guys and it's a shame because these guys actually sang and played their own instruments something you hardly ever see these days.Respect 2 Joe Public aka ""Atension""."
3,Strictly artistic perspective.,"This rating is strictly from an artists perspective. I'm not rating on word content at all. I got this for the soul purpose to do sketch studies of sumo bodies. The photos are gorgeous, but they are mostly close up shots. Not a lot of full bodies in here. A big turn off is that the binding almost immediately fell apart leaving the book in pieces."
1,Six letters is all I need....,"S U C K E DWith the exception of the character names, ABSOLUTELY nothing was even close to being right. It may have been an ""OK movie"" (if you like sludge scraped out of a Hollywood gutter), but it was an awful movie based on Toriyama's work. When you make an adaptation, the fan base is what you HAVE to appeal to! There are plenty of other movies out there that have an inspirational element to them; this was just like watching a airliner nosedive into a mountain."
1,This not Dragon ball at all !!!,This movie is really horrible.the story doesn't make any senseChatwin is a cool actor. however when he plays Goku.He his so emotionless and thats not like the Son Goku that everyone knows!!Who ever watch the real Dragon Ball Anime knows this movie is Crap !!.from the beginning to the end !!!Fox you suck in making movies !!thanks for destroying this epic Anime !!I hope!! no one buy this garbage of a film
1,BAD BAD,"I'm a huge fan of Dragon Ball, I was really excited about this movie but I was a little doubtful about this movie and it really turn out to be a REALLY HORRIBLE AND BAD MOVIE for much I have to say. So if you're planning in buying this movie I say don't it's not worth a penny, FOX did this just to rip people and insulted the Dragon Ball Franchise as well as Akiro Toriyama creator of the Series. So for anyone interest on this movie don't buy it save your money get something better this movie doesn't deserve this. The Plot on this movie is has no sense, there's alot of questions that leave you thinking or doubting even if you know Dragon Ball you get thrown out of the movie with no answers of what's going on, the special effects look really cheap they didn't take this movie seriously. So Overall just save your money get something else but don't get this like I said before not worth a PENNY, FOX just doesn't know how to do movies."
1,Dragon Ball Evolution Worst Movie I Have Seen,"Folks,I am a big Dragon Ball / DBZ / DB GT fan and I bought this so I could have a complete collection.In a sentence, this is the WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!!Even if you are a fan of DBZ... DON'T BOTHER. Wipe this from your memory.It makes a complete mockery of the iconic series.My guess is someone wanted to make a movie using DBZ as the backdrop, hit it big with the kids and come out with a series crafted from the Power Rangers business model as a follow-up. Didn't work.Thank you."
5,The Way i See It...,The Way I See It It's Like Smallville (It Takes Pieces and Parts From Superman But Its Not Superman) And That's How I Feel About This Movie It Took Pieces And Parts From Dragon Ball But It's Not Dragon Ball They Made It There Own!
3,"Good,but if your a fan of the anime sereis this may not be for you.","Ok. This movie was good to me, but if your a fan of the anime you might not like it. A few things were wrong in this movie that they should've seen. First of all where the hell is Krillin? He was there from the beginning, and I can't beleive they missed that! They never explained that Goku is a being called a Sayien, only saying that he was sent to earth as Ozaru(a giant monkey) in a human body, and that on his eighteenth birthday he would be ready to awaken. So where the hell is his tail huh? The Kamehameha wave sucked in this movie. Why the hell was he flying through the air with it? Overall good to watch one time around, but anime fans would not really like it."
5,Wow!!,I've seen it!! Only once though..It was way better than the reviews!!When I went back to see it again for the second time it stopped playing-.-I'm getting my copy as soon as it's available!!Can't wait 'till July!!
1,Stay away from this movie!,"Simply, a horrible movie for a number of reasons; my review will be more of a summary of SOME of the MAIN points mentioned in the other reviews (that I noticed) instead of a stand-alone review. The movie's acting and story is horrible, it does not follow the origins it's taken from faithfully (and not in a creative way; I don't protest to improvements or ""evolutions""), and all in all a boring and horrible movie. This movie is just an example of Hollywood taking something amazing, stripping it of its glamour, and throwing it back at the audience purely for the sake of creating more $$$.Simply put, DO NOT BUY! If you MUST see the movie and are desperate to waste two hours of your life, rent or borrow!"
1,america's critic,"i heard this sucked before i bought it but because im such a huge fan i had to watch it, omg ok ok characters dont look like the characters why not i guess the acters didnt want to act-- story was nothing like the cartoon wait a sec they probably never watched it!!!! before making this!!! beware cgi was horrible i almost died when i saw piccilo really i think they watched the first half of movie and said it was doodoo and threw crap in to end it fight scene was 2sec lol totally not dragon ball, ok give me 1,000,000 ill make dragon ball z ill start it off with freeza and spend more time with this --- 1* if i could i would put it at negative 10-- by the way if u see this dude playing goku punch him in his face for destroying this terrible all the way"
1,This is a BIG INSULT to a great series.,"Everything in this movie is awful and sloppy!The acting is bad, the plot is terrible, there are drab cliches, and a lot of rip-offs you wouldn't believe. This has the name Dragonball on it but don't expect anything of the sort! AVOID THIS FILM at all costs!"
1,What a sad effort to make a quick buck,"Honestly don't even bother wasting your time and money on this lousy movie. James Wong obviously can't direct for crap if this is the result. For someone whom has not seen the Dragon Ball manga you'd still expect him to direct a film with a decent plot right? what talent?. I mean Batman was a great comic and the movies were great but this film totally suck.Don't trust the 5 star reviews from a bunch of virtual marketers. (You might like this film if you are mentally aged 5 or under or under influence of drugs) If you don't believe me just read the other reviews from people with 1 star, we can't all be wrong, and we don't try and trick you into buying or seeing the movie too!"
1,Lame. Lame. Lame,I'm going to make this short. Ths movie is soo bad that i have to threw my movie (Dragoball Evolution)away in the garbage! Yes! IT's that bad! IM one of the biggest fan of dbz but this movie is just sooooo bad. I hope this helps.
1,Based on what?,"Ok there are 7 dragon balls and they did use the character names from Dragonball Z. But other than that the story line had nothing to do with Dragonball Z. If you are familiar with the series you will be extremely disappointed. If you aren't familiar with Dragonball Z skip this and watch the anime. I could go into more detail about how they changed: when characters met, the motivations of individual characters and how they changed the story line from the original series but it would lead to too many spoilers for anyone who has not seen the anime. Overall it was just disappointing."
3,Doug's revue,"Ok this movie could of been a lot better than what it was. They had good actors and good plot from the cartoons, but they blew it . The director must of been sleeping on the job, he took the story and boxed it in sections with no concern to the story. Well I could go on and on but I will not , this is just my opinion the movie could of been lots better. But for alot of special efects and chop sockie it may appeal to lot of other people. So give it shot you may like or not thats my opinion."
2,No real HD,"No real HD.Paid extra for HD - but it's not.Should be against the law tocharge you for HD, if it's not.It's a kid's movie."
1,"Never, ever watch. Ever.","To any who want to buy this movie, I will give you a few less painful alternatives; you could A-drink a bottle of Hydrochloric acid, B-stick your hand in a blender, or C-chew glass. No matter what you pick, watching this film would be a thousand times more horrible.This movie is on the level of Avatar: The Last Airbender, and if you have seen that, then you should know not to get this horrible live-action adaptation. The flaws are all the same; too rushed, a lack of vital characters, and no connection to the original story. It is just terrible. There is nothing good about it. If I had to put my hatred for this movie on a scale of one to ten, it would be OVER 9000.That is how much I despise this movie."
1,this movie is just a utter disgrace,the only thing they got right in this whole movie was the dragon balls but in my honest true opinon this is one of the worst movies ever made!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,so so movie,"i am a big fan of the dragonball series but the movie was so so, i don't want to put the movie down so much but the only thing i didn't like about this movie is that it didn't follow the anime storyline none of the actors fit the description of the anime characters except maybe bulma and piccolo.(SPOILER ALERT) My main problem was the story they could at least started him off arriving on the planet as a child and they ignore the krillin character he not in it at all, I don't know what actor could fit to play him. To me if your a die hard fan and want to check it out maybe rent it first. Maybe do a sequel to improve it and introduce vegeta, raditz, nappa, krillin, and tien."
1,This is NOT Dragonball at all!!!,"Everything in this movie is RUSHED RUSHED RUSHED!!!All the characters are REDUCED to stereotyical americanized cliches!Goku is a emo whiner and trade the Ki blast of light energy for airbending puffs of smoke.Bulma is a gung-ho type that screams Lara Croft.Roshi turned less of his usual perverted self into more bashful.Yamcha is a surfer dude like moron.And Piccolo is a Star wars Sith!Oozaru is 8ft instead of 80ft!! (I walked out of the theater angry because of that)And all the actors reek!The fighting is sloppy. The writing is garbage. The Directing is beyond terrible.There are many rip-offs (Spiderman,Star Wars,Avatar TLA,Matrix)This has the name Dragonball on it but don't expect anything of the sort! It's a DISCRACE!!! Who ever gives 5 stars likes cheesy crappy movies.AVOID THIS FILM at all costs it's a big waste of money!!!!!"
1,movie reeks,"The movie sucked big time. Im a huge fan of DBZ and have all the cartoons/sagas/animation movies for it. This live action rendering does no justice to the DBZ franchise and heres whys:1) the fight b/w picollo and goku lasts one minute and has no detail. In the cartoon, entire episodes were devoted to long drawn out battles between the hero and the villain.2) the special effects are mediocre.3) the actor playing goku doesnt have charisma for this role.4) too much screen time is devoted to goku and his 'trying to be cool' and him 'trying to get the girl'.5) the plot is weak, has many unexplained segments, and doesnt really go with the time lines laid out int he cartoons.Avoid the DVD!"
1,Dragonball De-Evolution,"I would not buy this movie, even if you don't know much about Dragonball or Z. This movie is a very poor adaptation, FOX went with a low budget for the film, they changed Goku's behavior around 180 degrees. It is a bit entertaining but that surely dies out real fast. The special effects weren't very good either. Save your money for a better movie then this, you'd just be wasting it on this pitiful of an excuse so called Dragonball movie. Oh and don't be fooled by the added Z-Edition, it's nothing special."
1,Worst Adaptation Ever,This movie is the sole reason Japan is so hesitant too allow the US to create live-action adaptations of their anime...
2,Dragonball Evolution Review,"Here is the thing about this movie people. I am a HUGE dragon ball and Dragon ball z fan. Now if you watch this movie and you are a fan like me than you will be INSANELY disappointed and angry. They really take a great amazing anime and spit on it, with annoying hollywood influences and annoying actors. The acting is pretty cheesy and the fighting is mediocre, however the special FX was pretty cool. If you erase from your mind that there is no such thing as an anime then i give the movie a 2 out of 5, but as a movie inspired by the anime? well its certainly gets a 0 out of 5, the movie is pretty awful and i am happy it did not do well. They will need Marvel or the makers of the Matrix movies to rebuild this movie. The price i bought this for, which is $4 is the price this movie should have been from the beginning. That's all it's worth to me."
2,movie is so boring crappy acting and plot,Glad I didnt pay over 5.00 for this got it at Walmart from the 5 buck dvd bin. It is ok if you are totally bored out of your mind. Also I didnt like them potraying Piccolo as the evil dude in the anime he is sorta like Darth Vader he changes cause he raise Gokus son in the early anime verson after Goku is killed by Rad his older brother.
3,"Not bad, but not excellent.",Evolution was a good standalone action movie. I am a James Marsters fan from Buffy/Angel and I got a couple of other movies he was in to round out the collection.Quite a few parts of the plot stayed the same.Although they should have made Goku's Oozaru form gigantic and actually destroy some buildings in the city or something before he reverted.Also the girls should have been less aggressive.I did expect a young asian or asian looking actor to play Goku but Chatwick did well in the role.And of course the great Chow Yun-Fat did exceptionally well in his role.I think the modernization of the film caused the plot holes.they mixed Goku and Gohan's roles by letting Goku go to formal high school. Also where was the OX King? Having him in as Chi chi's father would have made it a bit better.By itself it was a pretty good action movie.However in my collection I'd put it with the martial arts films instead of the dragonball ones.
3,Manga comes to real-life in the movies,"A good fantasy adventure movie. Based on the Japanese Manga ""Dragonball"", this is a cartoon brought to the big screen. OK, this review is based exclusively on the movie as I haven't seen nor read any of the original Manga mateials. I really enjoyed the story and this was well made. I specially enjoyed the character Chi-chi. The reason for giving a 3 is that the story was a bit simple and the build-up to the big closing scene was too easy; perhaps this is a side effect of using a manga as your basis. Yes, I will watch this movie again in the future and do recommend it. P.S. Nice to see Chow Yun Fat in the movie."
1,if negative number could be given i would,"bad plot, terrible acting, bad fight scenes, nothing to see here but dribble, I have 6 year old that didnt like this movie. If a 6 year that loves everything hated this then u know its bad. Do your self a favor and watch something else."
2,Mediocre,"The movie is is much like Masters of the Universe, a low budget deviation from the source material. It is at best mediocre and short. The plot and speical effects are at best of a TV-Movie variety and James Marsters part seems it was cut down quite a bit. I would say only to rent it but never to purchase it."
1,Not worth it AT ALL! Look elsewhere,"Do not even waste your money on this 'slap-to-the-face-of-db-fan-movie'. The story is so rushed that half the time one wonders what just happened? The special effects are so cheesy. Goku never went to school. Goku was never supposed to know what a girl is. Goku was never supposed to know cities existed.To summarize the whole movie. Basically over 150+ episode were crammed into this 1hr+ movie, which translate to failure, rush, characters appearing out of the blue. Very very poor movie. It is a disgrace to use the word 'DragonBall' in this."
1,Dragonball: Evolution,what the hell totally miss cast an aisan guy should have played goku terrible movie disapointment to dragoon ball z fans
1,Sucks,"Dragon ball fanz Storyline is not coherent . This movie got americanized , just to get the people to come to see it . Yes the movie was bad . Director over did it , just to show how great he is . Yea , you made it suck with your ego . Master roshi Over acting for that role . Not even willing to shave head , wear turtle shell or even sunglassed . Just wasted my time watching this movie to write this review and be honest. I don't like it , Action was good , but the big battle sucked . They should have made the movie in 3 parts and hope that someone would have payed for the other 2 movies . They should have made a movie introducing all the characters , and Asian actors . Start with emperor pilaf. If successful make more anime movies of dbz or rest of bd with bathroom humor and get the customs right"
4,Dragon Dragon Rock the Dragon!,"While not the greatest movie of all time, this is still a good movie for the price. Also if your a Dragonball fan, then it goes with out saying that you'll likely enjoy this movie. James Marsters as Piccolo is a must see!"
4,The rating:,I liked the action and the comedy the movie offered. Not a lot to the story line but overall a very good movie.
1,It's the worst thing of my life...,"It's the worst thing of my life, for reals it made me cry... Not gonna lie, it's horrible, don't get it."
5,DragonBall Fanboys Suck,"To start off, I myself am a HUGE fan of Dragon Ball and anything there of.But it makes me almost ashamed to be one when I see these children putting this movie down because ""it isn't Dragon Ball"".Well of course it's not Dragon Ball. Was I the only person who noticed the tag ""An ORIGINAL Motion Picture""?If any of you ""fans"" had any kind of sense then you would know that the show you grew up loving was far from the ""real"" Dragon Ball series.Use some common sense and stop putting this movie down. It was very well done for an ORIGINAL script."
1,Horrible movie,"Simply, a horrible movie for a number of reasons; my review will be more of a summary of SOME of the MAIN points mentioned in the other reviews (that I noticed) instead of a stand-alone review. The movie's acting and story is horrible, it does not follow the origins it's taken from faithfully (and not in a creative way; I don't protest to improvements or ""evolutions""), and all in all a boring and horrible movie. This movie is just an example of Hollywood taking something amazing, stripping it of its glamour, and throwing it back at the audience purely for the sake of creating more $$$.Simply put, DO NOT BUY! If you MUST see the movie and are desperate to waste two hours of your life, rent or borrow!"
1,Dragon Ball Bastard,"I already wasted enough time watching this movie, so I'll keep this short:The plot and characters have nothing to do with the anime/manga. Instead, we get the stereotypical soap opera teenager trying to hook up with chicks in high school. Basically Disney Chanel material.Production quality is as poor as daytime tv. In fact, this movie feels like watching an episode of Power Rangers, and I don't mean that as a compliment."
1,Junk,Goku was supposed to be a little kid. Goku never went to school. Goku is really raw and does not know anything of city life. This movie was rushed. The storyline was very poor. The special effects were horrible. Nothing about this movie is good basically. Pathetic. Waste of money. HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO ANYONE! PERIOD!
1,"Let's just stop making movies all together now, shall we?","This truly is a sad time for cinema. Oh well, when you can get a movie out of a freaking vending machine, the artistic integrity once involved in film making is thrown out the window. 2009 has been a terrible year for film."
3,okay for kids,"This movie barely makes it into the martial arts category for me. The martial arts is way over the top and not really focused on. This is strange because the movie is all about a ""martial arts"" battle at the end. In fact, the final fight scene was anticlimactic and disappointing.The good news for this movie is that my kids loved it. Both of them are girls and take martial arts themselves and they thought the movie was a lot of fun. In the DVD extra features there is a training segment where they teach you how to do stuff from the movie and my girls got up and participated. The whole feature was corny and over the top, but my girls ate it up.Overall it wasn't horrible, but it wasn't good either. It is kind of fun and Jamie Chung is fun to look at. Kids from the 5-12 range will probably get a kick out of it. The martial arts content was sub part, but the movie is based off of an anime that is based off of a manga. I give it 3 exploding fists."
2,poorly written,"I purchased this book with the intent of learning something significant about Boltzmann's personal life, about the context in which he made his discoveries. I found the prose to be cumbersome and the structure of the chapters to be poorly thought out.the author repeatedly falls into the trap of including too much information, while failing to succinctly capture the big idea - which remains obscured. while the book is technically adept, it adds little to the overall presentation, as the mathematics is wrapped with poorly edited and badly structured prose. the technical portions of the text are then insufficient to serve as a complete technical explanation on boltzmann's ideas while distracting from the point of the biography.with so much great writing out there it is hard to justify time and money spent on a book so poorly written."
5,works great,This a good product. I use it after I give my dog a bath and it prevents ear infections that dogs sometimes get when their ears are wet. It causes no irritation.
5,Epi-Otic Ear Cleaner,"Fantastic product for keeping your dog's ears clean. I've tried a few, and Virbac's is the best. Thank you for making such a great product!"
5,Miracle for ears . . .,"for long-eared dogs. Like at least one other reviewer, I also have a Springer, and his ears get dirty very easily. Not good for my faithful friend. But with a few drops of this product in each ear, a few times per week, voila! Clean ears and happy dog. Just a couple drops in an ear, then massage it in before Fido has a chance to shake his head, then do the other ear. He'll shake his afterwards, but that's expected. If your dog's ears are already clean, this product is great for maintenance. If your dog's ears are dirty, this product, along with the ever-useful cotton ball, will clean them out. I keep this on hand as a can't-live-without staple. Shipping from the seller was speedy too, and the product was well-packaged."
3,Note: Fresh Apple Blossom Fragrance,"We usually order the original formula of Epi-Otic and just realized the little red circle on the bottom left of the bottle says 'Fresh Apple Blossom Fragrance'. Well, the fragrance is a far cry from apple blossom. I'm assuming that's why this larger bottle is cheaper than the original formula (that actually smells good)...At least I know what to check for the next time we order. Stick with the original formula."
1,I do NOT recommend this product,"I definitely do not recommend this product! My vet gave me this stuff for my cat because she has ear allergies. He said that keeping her ears cleaned about once a week with this stuff would help her ears. Well, I can't use this stuff with my cat because she HATES it when I put this in her ears. I do it as gently as I can but it seems to only irritate her ears more than anything. I definitely DO NOT recommend this product."
4,works well enough,"Our dog has major allergies and ends up with chronic ear infections. We have taken her to the vet many times to help control this, but she is allergic to many pollens, dusts, and certain foods. We have used Zymox in the past with good success and this works about the same - though the ""apple"" smell isn't very pleasing - would rather no scent."
4,Holds up to wind,"Only used a couple of times so far. Holds up to the wind without rolling. But, because it is so sturdy, it's also harder to hold on to. Color was as advertised (green). Easy to open and close."
1,$10 Drugstore Umbrellas Hold Up Better,"I purchased this umbrella, and on the first use it completely feel apart. I walk to work in downtown Chicago, and have used cheap drugstore umbrellas for years. I upgraded to this product hoping for something that was sturdier and had a larger canopy. This umbrella fell apart in a light wind during a light rain. I will never purchase a ShedRain product again. I firmly suggest that no one purchase this product, you will be very disappointed and very wet!"
4,"Not a bedtime book, but a good intro into Archaeology","I got Hayden's book through a friend who took his course at Simon Fraser University. I originally wanted to read through it before starting in on similar courses, simply to have a bit of a background on the subject. I found that the book is definitely one that you want to STUDY not just READ. It takes a considerable amount of time to go through the book, and Hayden doesn't really explore other issues besides the one he is biased to. He states his points of view, and doesn't go into other just as important views. I did, however, find his book to be substantially informative, and will be interested to read future works. I doubt if I will take any of his courses at SFU, but would be ecstatic to meet and talk with him about our shared interest."
4,Not necessarily for beginners,"This book is a great book for me -- and for my husband. Buddhist and Vedic practitioners, respectively, this book bridged a gap and we enjoyed it thoroguhly."
4,Great puppy,My daughter got this for her second birthday...she absolutely loves it.she loves puppy's it is quiet soft and goes everywhere with us.
2,didn't get it,"this was required reading for my masters in ancient history course of study for the renaissance. i was disappointed to say the least. i thought this book was interesting as a window into the mind of the renaissance, but that was about it. i didn't see any profiund thoughts or ideas that really made any sense. this is one of those books that lives on its reputation and should be put into place as a piece that is not timeless, but just for its insight into a period of history. maybe there was more to the whole work in its entirety that is a shallow reflection of this book. that may be where this books gets its life, but i don't know. if you want humanist philosophy go somewhere else."
1,much more work than fun,After buying this and feeling the weight of the package I should have known that there was going a massive book explaning how to play the game.It is way too complicated to have fun without researching for hours. I blame myself for not looking at the reviews first for if I did I would have known not to buy it.
1,terrible game,"i bought this game thinking it would be great but it is crappy,the graphics are great but the game i dont understand.i tryed just learning the controls but i found out only to fire and move.here are some cons and pros,cons:theres like a thousand controls you have to learni couldnt do anything nothing to fight,i couldnt get into starbases or buildings,theres like 5 or 6 computer things in this like screens and menus.prosgood graphicsthe easyist thing to play is being a marine which is like fps (first person shooter)(though it is freakin boring at begining)"
1,meh,"EVE Online, Freelancer, Homeworld, even old school Wing Commander and Privateer titles are much better, IMHO."
1,Starforce Strikes Back,"Nevermind how complicated this game is purported to be - don't buy it just for the outrageous hassle you'll go through just trying to get it to run on your system, because of the anti-ripping technology that's spot-welded onto this thing. If I wanted to be challenged by the complexity of getting a complicated program just to run on Windows, I'd just as soon hand-code an emulator for the Apollo Space Program as try to get this thing to cooperate."
1,Wasted money,I see why I'm the first review. I'm the only one stupid enough to buy it. Way too many controls to have to try to remember. An airline pilot has less. (I've got a simulator)
1,Waste of money,"This DVD is apsolute waste of money.It's not cheap, promisses a lot, delivers nothing.The length of the DVD is due to fact that when theyrender a picture you are waiting until image is rendered.It's like if you bought a book about painting,and you watch on video how the paint dry...This is just one of huge wasting of time on this DVD.None of the work on DVD looks truly proffesional,and the level of explanation is just like simple demo,which is just not enough.I haven't learned anything from this DVD, I doubt anyonewill except total begginers which might find this interestingif they never heard of Mental ray, but they start learningmaya."
1,Do Not Buy This Video,"Judging for the previous reviews, I thought that I had finally found a good set of Mental Ray tutorials. However, I was wrong. These tutorials more or less just graise accross the basics of mental ray and the hypershade menu. I expected a more in depth explaination of how to set up Global Illumination using Photonics and Final Gathering. They mearly give brief examples of these techniques and nothing more. Where's the examples of fine tuning and animating with GI? And then there's the Mental Ray Shader library, which they don't even mention. Probably the most powerful feature of the software. ..."
5,Mesmer bottles up something sweeter than Yoohoo!,"This DVD content ranges from junior to professional levels inharnessing the power of mental ray.With this fast-paced video I was able to use the mental ray renderer more efficiently in Maya.The crew at Mesmer's unique teaching style when disscussing mentalray concepts are easily applied to the mental ray renderer usingother 3d packages like Softimage's XSI. All in all, a definitemust-have for taming mental ray in Maya."
4,Check your state laws before buying this,"I am seeing that most are upset with this product because they didn't research before purchasing. If you just do a simple search on laws for Wills and Trusts in your state, and find out what you can and cannot use or if an attorney has to prepare your documents, you won't have a problem. I found out that this kit will work great since I live in South Dakota. An attorney does not have to prepare it and I only need 2 witnesses to sign my will and does not have to be notarized, but if I want, it can be notarized/affidavit from witnesses (so they don't have to search for these 2 witnesses if I die--that may tie up my will in probate)...again, just research a bit before you buy, but for the price, this was the best choice for me and my husband (we have 2 young children)."
3,Good but very buggy software,"Overall it is a good kit to have, but still I think Suze needs to improve the documents. The software is very buggy. When I try to print the documents, it messes everything up. There are always unwanted spaces and page breaks in the middle of the documents, which makes the documents very unprofessional. Title will be at the last line of one page and the contain starts from the next page. How stupid it can be. Besides, when I choose Double spaces, it converts some of the documents to double space and leaves the rest unchanged, making the documents unusable.There are several technical issues with this kit that Suze and her team should have fixed before selling the product. I will appreciate if they fix these problems, which they should have done by now. It's been more than one year the product is in the market with all these technical issues. Their latest updates doesn't even solve these issues."
2,Does not create a living will,"I purchased this software specifically because I wanted a living will in accordance with the laws of Georgia. Both are promised in the online description above. When I opened it, there was no option anywhere for a living will, only a Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care, and it did not offer to tailor even that document to Georgia law.I went online to the help function. To their credit, they did answer quickly. They answered ""Within our software we a Living or Revocable Trust and regular will. Also, our product creates all of your documents under California law.""So, no living will option, no Georgia law option. Of no use to me.It was easy to use, what little I did try. Thus the 2 stars. I did not use or preview the rest of the product, so I can't say yea or nay as to whether the other capabilities promised are present."
3,not great but not bad either,"I love Suze, beleive me I do but this will/trust kit is a bit too simplistic. It's dosen't take into account that perhaps your significant other does not live with you so when I entered the name only my addess would come up. I went through and completed all the wills and trust etc.... but have not gotten around to getting them notorized. Her information about having to ""fund"" a trust was invaluable a lot of people I know who had trusts did not realize this either. I wish the kits gave the user more ability to change certain things and not be limited to setting up a will or trust in just the way Suze says. For example I could not figure out how to leave a percentage to some people and an exact dollar amount to others. It might be in there but I could not find it."
4,Complaints about it being an online program,"For the reviewer(s) who complained about not knowing the program stored information online... it clearly states on the box cover ""NEW ONLINE VERSION"" ...should have been a clue..."
5,so easy making a trust and will,"I've been putting if off for so many years making my own trust and will, I finally bought suze orman's will and trust kit. It was very informal and detail, very easy to understand. I probably saved over $1,000 just by doing it my-self. If you want to avoid probate this is the product to purchase!"
1,Software has several bugs,"I entered all data to create a Revocable Trust. I found several bugs in the program: total value of the estate was not counted properly, and the printout had several text areas completely white. Also I could not create a read-only pdf format that is easy to store and print.Liked voice of Suze and others in the background and their clear explanations. Need to fix the bugs however. Much cheaper than Quicken WillMaker Plus, but the Quicken product looks more robust."
1,Sunshine Books 3308 El Camino Ave Ste. 300-196 Sacramento Ca 95821,Sun Sunshine Books in Sacromental Ca is a true RIP OFF! Bought Suzi Orman's Will & Trust for 39.00. On the box it lists for $19.95. Sunshine Books bought this at Costco & charged me $20.00 over list.
2,suze orman will& trust kit,"Interesting,,... but I never actuallyused her stuff.-just a few: of her ideas.Most paperwork.. requires an attorneyanyway. ~ Her forms,, may or not be,acceptable in some states ."
1,Worthless Product,"I agree with the person who said the product has many bugs. My problem was that I could not print any of the documents. I was very disappointed and Suze Orman's people only told me ""we are looking into the problem."" If I cannot print the documents they are worthless to me and my family.I ultimately got my money back (less shipping and handling) so therefore I lost time and money. Don't waste your time and money. Suze - GET IT TOGETHER BEFORE SELLING THOUSANDS OF THESE THINGS!"
2,pathetic,"during startup, it asks if you have audio. as i don't like talking apps, i click ""no"" - no audio. it starts blabbing. kill the audio on the computer.the lack of flexibility is irritating but it doesn't take much to convert a pdf into some other format.contrary to some reviews, it worked okay on osx.i won't be buying any other orman products, thanks ..."
3,Virus from CD install on my computer,Content so far is very helpful. Will review more later. Virus showed up in my D drive after installing information from CD
2,It messed up my printer,"The CD looks okay, and then when you go print the documents it completely messes up my printer, to the point that I wasted an entire new package of paper and still cannot print anything on my printer."
5,Expert knows this is great,"Dear Friends: I have been an estate and trust attorney for 28 years. This product is the best for the consumer of its type. It does not allow you to make a mistake because the user only answers questions, and the product writes the legal documents. The biggest problem with self help legal programs is they allow the user to write in their words. This causes unintended consequences as many words have legal meanings the user is unaware of and few of us write with enough precision for court review. Suze's chapter on estate planning in her Road to Wealth book was rated #1 by Sept. 2003 Consumer Reports. That means 7 lawyers felt what she did was the best of all the books they reviewed about estate plannning. This product gives better documents than many attorneys prepare."
5,Best Deal..includes Document Organizer...$23.96,"This is a really inexpensive way to get all of your proverbial ducks in a row. This Amazon listing doesn't have the document holder that would be the holder for your will, trust, birth certificate, and tax information, etc..which I think is organizationally vital. You can go to SuzeOrman.com and look under her product listings or click on this link: http://suzeorman.com/audio_finprotection.aspThe bottom line is $23.96 + $5.00 for standard shipping and sales tax if applicable. This price beats out QVC's by about $20.00 when it's all said and done...Happy Finances! Victoria"
2,Will & Trust Software Poor,There is much better will and trust software on the market. This software doesn't allow you to edit or make any changes in the document. It is not a word processor either. You cannot talor the document to you needs. Recommend you get another product or same your money.
4,Will & Trust Kit,"I bought this product as used. I was able to run it but it did not allow me to make changes because I did not have certain codes that were sent with the disc (per the software instructions during use of the program).I sent an email to the seller and was told the codes came when it was interacting with the website, this did not happen so I deinstalled the software and purchased a different package from Quicken.Overall, I liked the software I was able to use and favor the S.O. Kit more than the one I now have because it was much easier to use and not as involved in so many details."
1,"on Mac OS 10.5.6 , It would not save or print.","I had trouble on my Mac, completed it, Saved it, then could not print it. Quickly tested on Pc and was able to print.I purchased for Mac and it would not work so I give it 1 star.All forms in book have sample printed all over them and are hard to read.Seems to be designed for PC"
1,Suze Ormans Will & Trust Kit,"The software did not work.I could not load it up. Even my son, who is a computer science major could not get it to work."
4,Pretty Good,"This CD is very informative and perfect for my husband and I. We are in our mid/late 20's and don't have children yet but wanted to get everything in order. This CD allows us to do that, and add and change the will as needed in the future. Definitley worth the price for the health care part. It's very simple, and easy to understand."
4,Good product!,"We were looking for something like this for a while, as we have not set up trust and will etc....ever. That said- this product lets you do it for a fraction of the cost what you'd pay a lawyer to create for you.Definitely worth it!Thanks Suze!!!"
1,No Customer Service,"This product was a waste for me. I purchased a Suze Orman product several months ago and just got around to pulling up the CD. The CD would not load properly, so I looked for a customer service/tech support number in the product materials. There was none. Then I went to her website. The only customer service was for her FICO product. They could not help me and when I explained the problem with the lack of customer service, they said they had heard the same thing from other callers. If you buy any of her products, be aware there is no customer service available, even if the CD is defective."
2,Problems Printing Will!,"Add me to the list of people who could not print their will.I had it all filled out and ready to print, and then nothing! Well, I did get one or two sentences to print before it just started producing blank pages. Tried it again a few more times, same thing. What good is a will if you cannot print more than a couple of sentences?It's not like I'm computer illiterate or ran out of ink. Solving computer/technical issues for my clients customers is how I bring home the bacon. This includes printing problems. This software is sadly lacking. Save your money!"
3,A bit too simplistic,"As long as you fit neatly into the offered catergories, this software works very well. The problem for me is that I needed to make some changes to the finished document. There is no way to change it within the software and you cannot save the document in another format to change using a word processor. So, you either print it exactly as the software produces it, or you're out of luck.I would rate this software 4 1/2 stars if you could save the document to .doc or .rtf format."
1,Unable to report a problem with online help.,"The product worked well in the beginning but the help line keeps coming back with ""Application Error Occurred"" and I have no way to report the error as there is no way to reach the Suze Orman website. Most annoying as it makes the product useless."
1,Unsat,"For people with vision problems, it was extremely difficult to read. Not only was the print extremely small (probably an 8 font size instead of the acceptable 12) and the coloring was lime green which made it even more difficult to read. I couldn't read the information well enough to clear my personal information the disc so, rather than give it away or return it, I cut it in pieces. I would not recommend this product."
3,simplistic,This is okay for people who have never been exposed to wills or trusts. Does not allow you edit easily or transfer docs to legal size etc like Willmaker. I'm sure it has to do with compromising their advice but you just don't have any leeway whereas other programs flat out tell you that if you modify their language it's your responsibility. Probably ok if you know NOTHING about trusts and still want to investigate doing them yourself. I expected more.
3,zProtection portfolio,The book was fine but the CDrom for the forms I can no longerget on my computer. What good is the book without being ableto print out the forms for a revocable trust. I have askedtwice for an answer to this problem and received no communication from you. What can I do?????? My Email address is anfjef@optonline.net
1,Come On...,Upon ordering the item I was told that it should not have been posted because the company does not have any melodicas available. Thanks.
4,Weight Loss Surgery for Dummies,"I recently had this surgery and was looking for another source of information for my ""library"". This is the perfect edition."
5,great reference book as you go through WLS!,"This was the first of 2 books I read as I prepared for WLS. As my surgery date approaches (10 days) I feel confident about my outcome because I researced my doctors and made myself knowledgeable of what to expect. This book did the last part. It is easy to refer to and after finishing, I went back and high-lighted parts I felt I would need to refer to later. The part I liked best was the way the chapters were outlined at the beginning of each. If you needed information later and couldn't remember where you read it, you could look on the first page of the chapter and see what it contained. Written like a information book should!!!!"
5,Simplicity is a good thing,"Most of the ""Dummies"" books include the essential facts presented in a way that is useful and painless. This book is no exception. It takes a difficult subject and provides a great reference work to understand the subject.This book is especially useful to help family members and friends of those considering bariatric surgery to understand the procedures, choices, and post-surgery lifestyle of the patient."
4,Good Primer,Excellent plain language information for everyday use. Great starting point for anyone considering Bariatric Surgery.
4,good book,This was a good book to gain knowledge about the do's and don'ts of wls. Much of this information is available on the internet or at your fingertips when going to thinnertimesforum.com
1,Weight Loss,It is ok. Not crazy about it. Sorry about thatand Hardly understand. That is it.Thank youMrs Nies
4,Good for beginning the journey but no carry thru for long-termers,This is a thorough book covering much of the technical information you need going into the surgery and the immediate aftermath. But I'm going on 5 years out of the surgery and looking for information that will help me with the ups and downs of maintaining my weight loss. Fat No More - Long Term Success Following Weight Loss Surgery covers more of those issues - plus it's helpful for those starting out to know what's ahead.
5,A must-read if you're considering Weight Loss Surgery,"This is a well-researched, quick and easy-to-read primer on weight loss surgery. It outlines the pros and cons of the various types of surgery, offers help in selecting a surgeon, tells you what to expect at each stage of your recovery, and even has some post-op recipes. There are sections on the emotional as well as physical changes you'll experience and suggests ways of handling non-supportive as well as supportive friends, relatives, and co-workers.I only wish I had read this prior to my consultation with my surgeon. I would have had a lot more and different questions to ask him. If you are even just thinking about WLS, you should read this book."
5,Very informative,This a great book to help you decide if this is for you.It is not a story about anyone's life it is just filled with great helpful information.
5,Wonderful Information...,"This book was a very concise and straight to the point book on Weight Loss Surgery. I would definitely recommend it, before or after surgery."
5,"Great book, Great Value!",The book came to me in great condition. It arrived here quickly. I would order from Amazon.com again and again. Great service! Thank You! Gayle Wright
4,Great Source,Excellent book for those pre and post ops. Provides all the information necessary to have surgery and how to deal with the insurance companies.
4,Weight Loss Surgery,"Book is very informative, answers a lot of the questions a person would have about this surgery"
3,An average book,"If you don't know UML, you may start with it. If you have a little bit knowledge on UML, then the book is just too wordy for you. This book is best if the authors can compress it into 1/3 of its current volumn.Some of the symbols are used before they are explained. But in general, most of the concepts are explained clearly.None of the phone number and http address given together with this book work. So you won't get a free-CD through this way."
2,Not very good.,"Book is full of repeative sentences, every thing is told many times. Very flustrating to read. Too much things about modeling-process itself and not about UML. The content of this book would need only 100 pages, not 450."
2,repetitive repetitive and lacks good examples,I should have believed those reviewers who said it was repetitive. Not just re-re-reiteration which can be useful sometimes but exact cut and paste duplication from one paragraph to the next. This book could have been half as long without the repetition. Also it needs some better more realistic examples to illustrate how the UML works outside of some extremely simplistic situations. I should have gone with my first instincts and bought UML Distilled but I got suckered into thinking this book would be more in depth but instead it is just puffed up.
4,Robot as author?,"Systematic like the output of a robot. Every chapter has the same structure without any creativity. But it's good, because it introduces UML from the ground up so that one can apply it for practical purposes. And it's also good, because it's from one of the founders and by reading the founders books, one may look behind the scenes, here only by realising how extremely systematic Booch is."
3,It's a better-than-average user guide - not a tutorial,"It's really a user guide, not a tutorial. In this sense, it's not so read-able as a book (Who will read a user guide of something from cover to cover? Very few, I guess)However, if you just pick whatever piece you are interested, and spend some time really digging into it, you will find many good insights. In this sense, it's much better than average user guide.I personally find the ""Common Modeling Techniques"" section of each chapter very useful."
4,Very good for apprentices and professionals,"This book cover 1.4 UML kernel that already a litte offuscated by the new version, but show up UML kernel and its foundations very well such as didn't see recents books, good book for inquiry always!."
4,Definitive to an extreme,"Who other than the inventors of the Unified Modeling Language to write the definitive guide to it? Booch, Jacobson, and Rumbaugh have answered the call with this book describing UML syntax, semantics, and diagrams with great detail.Throughout the book, the authors draw parallels to building architecture for corresponding UML elements for software architecture. There's effective use of two-color printing to distinguish metadiscourse and metadiagrams from actual UML diagrams.And it's deep: VERY deep. The authors explore nearly every use of every UML element, covering things that most users of UML will never use. In that regard, this book makes a better reference manual than a user's guide. I'd recommend getting this book to sit on the shelf when you have questions or want to solve an ambiguity, but stick with Martin Fowler's ""UML Distilled"" for the core UML that you'll use day-to-day."
1,It is a really ugly book.,"This is a really ugly book. The sample case have and will NEVER happen in real life. Just like previous reviewer said, if you know anything about object modeling this book is a waste of time."
2,Great Theory Poorly Described and Lacking,"The concept of UML is a great one and while the authors are great, the book is not. Like the Strousoup C++ it stinks. Just because they developed the idea doesn't mean they can write. The books reads like an Academic book. They try to counteract this with a catchy example at the beginning of each chapter, but fail to explain UML detail in any breadth. At the end of the book I am left feeling like UML is great, but I'm tired, frustrated, and am not quite clear how to use it in any applications -- only that I should."
1,Much unnecessary wind and rambling,"Booch can really write the filler material. Dull, repetitious and imprecise! 10% good material..wasting trees! Prefer Muller's ""Instant UML"" by far. Forget ""UML Distilled"" which is an OO society book. Dahlings!..the 3 Amigos are having a party. Stick to science!"
3,"Never saw such a bad ""perfect"" book","This book seems to be a ""perfect"" book about an important subject written by the world experts. I must confess that I waited for it a long time, I even preordered it, but it took me about 1/2 year to read through it. I didn't like to read it. (I loved Fowlers ""UML Distilled"" and still recommend it highly.)Its difficult to put the finger on why the book is so bad and why I constantly felt cheated. Its well structured, beautifully typeset, each single sentence seems to be good.So what made me feel so uneasy. Maybe too much distance to the everyday problems. Too little critical assessment of UML and the implementation in existing tools. Certainly too much nearly repitition of contents. Maybe I just have difficulties to accept that this in not a true book but a USER GUIDE. But a user guide to what product?!"
5,Very good UML guide,"The book is a good overview of all the basic UML concepts, and illustrates in a very simple way how UML can be applied to develop software systems."
1,Seriously Outdated,"I bought this book around 2 years ago. Today, I took it out and walk thru it with Rational Rose 2002 Enterprise Edition only to find that it was seriously outdated. For example, Implementation View has been changed to Component View and there is no isQuery property option for the class operation. These mismatches abound. Turn to other sources for up-to-date UML information."
3,An average book,"If you don't know UML, you may start with it. If you have a little bit knowledge on UML, then the book is just too wordy for you. This book is best if the authors can compress it into 1/3 of its current volumn. Some of the symbols are used before they are explained. But in general, most of the concepts are explained clearly.None of the phone number and http address given together with this book work. So you won't get a free-CD through this way."
2,The Reference Manual is a better buy,"I have read both the User's Guide and the Reference Manual, which are generally intended to be bought as a pair. The Reference Manual is better organized, and is an invaluable resource for anyone who does a lot of UML modeling.This book, however, is just a dump of UML information, fairly ecletic but not always in sufficient depth. It is good information, but the poor organization makes it useless after the initial reading.If you are looking to learn UML, it IS possible to get a good feel for it from this book. However, something like ""UML for Dummies"" will also give you a good introduction, at a better price. If you will be modeling a lot, and want a deep understanding of UML, then it would be wiser to buy the Reference Manual instead."
4,Great earrings,"Fun earrings. A ''tad'' bigger than I expected. But, I got over it, and wear them all the time. Because of this order I figured out how big 20mm, 30mm and 50mm measurements are in regards to hoops! LOL. Basically, this one is about almost 2in."
5,tarnish free sterling earrings,"Easy to care for earrings. No longer do I have dull silver hoops in need of a polish. Also, they have an easy yet secure clasp."
1,Unless you are a pirate... buyer beware.,"These hoops are flimsy and the clasps are terrible. I was looking for a pair of daily wear hoops. These are not the right choice. The clasps did not stay shut and the earrings would fall off my ears throughout the day, which is not a good look when you are in meetings.Alas, within 2 days of my new earrings arriving, one of them has fallen off somewhere and now I only have one. And since I'm not a pirate, that just won't do. I wasted $20 here and hope you don't do the same. Keep looking."
4,wrong description,I spent alot of time on the phone as the box said 40 feet and did not identify that it was double laminate. I had to contact the supplier and they could not find the answer and had to return a phone call to me. The description said 50 feet when I purchased. Items should be labeled correctly. As far as the product I have used it for years and hope the new one is as good as the old. Mislabeled items are frustrating.
4,Works great and easy to use!,"This laminate is so easy to use. I only wish it were a little less expensive. It covers everything without wrinkles or bubbles. The only downside is that tape doesn't stick to it. I gave it 4 stars for this reason. I made some projects that I was going to stick together using adhesive velcro tabs, but they just peeled right off. Other than that, it works great. I prefer it over heat laminate because I can cut all the way to the edge of the paper, and even through the paper, without causing bubbles or peeling."
2,"Font size ""unreadable""","The font in this book was too small to read, thus was useless for me. I returned this book to the owner ""as prescribed"" and have yet to get my refund."
3,Matthew Henry's Commentary,"Book was in very good condition, and the fact the seller was overly fair about the binding, and the the book is very thourough but the words are sooooooooo small!! I needed a commentary and I thank you for it so much. May God bless you"
4,Goodwill Sc,I had a problem with the order from Goodwill. I did receive a prompt reply after they did there feedback review from me. I could not reach them by phone. Their e-mail resolved the issue.
3,Need 2 pair of glasses,Matthew Henry's review of the whole bible is certainly wordy but contains concise thoughts and explanations of many questions posed by less studied readers of the bible. My main difficulty is the size of the print. It makes using the book difficult and would have been a much better choice to have been a 2 volume set with words that are easily read.
2,Matthew Henry Commentary,"Matthew Henry's Commentary on the Whole BibleThis commentary covers a lot of scripture and is very informative but the print so small.It strains my eyes even with my bifocals,especially at evening time.It is a big book,heavy.Of course I'm sure that it has to have smaller print in order to be a single volume to cover the whole Bible.People with better eyesight can do much better study.That's my situation and judgement on this commentary.Calvin R."
1,I would not recommend,"I ordered two of these books, one for my father and one for myself. The print is so extremely small, neither of us could read it. The pages are large and full of tiny print, it was a chore to read the first paragraph. The content may be good but it doesn't matter if you can't read it! I would have preferred 2 books with standard size print."
4,Concise: Not the complete commentary!,"I bought this thinking it was the entire Matthew Henry commentary. Don't be fooled, as I was, by being off guard and by misleading words on the cover like ""on the whole"" and ""complete in one volume."" Note that the title says ""Concise"" and ""The best of Matthew Henry."" Also, the publisher gives no mention inside of the book that the commentary is a selective commentary.I had been reading the commentary online, through Blue Letter Bible's commentary section. It was disappointing to find that I had not received the entire commentary. Each chapter contains about a fourth of what Henry actually wrote.However, the material in this book still makes for a sweet devotional reading, and the price is reasonable. But again, if you want to get the most out of a given chapter in your personal Bible study, I would recommend the entire commentary over this ""concise"" publication."
2,Matthew Henry Bible Commentary,"This is a heavy book containing extremely valuable information, it's a classic. However, the print is very small and too difficult to spend time reading."
2,Flawed Kindle Version,"I am familiar with this in print form and was extremely excited about it on the Kindle.Unfortunately the Kindle version is poorly formatted. The TOC is unusable unless you are running the smallest (side 1) font. Furthermore the navigation could be much improved to reduce page flipping and provide better access.The print work receives a 5 star (and costs much more) but if you are looking at the Kindle version, I only give a 2. I really hope the publisher addresses this with an update."
2,Too hard to Read,"This is a lovely book in most every way, except the print is very teeny, tiny and the ink is light, so it is very difficult to readand that's what I bought it for, to read. So I am disappointed."
3,Just OK,"Henry's commentaries are obviously very old and available widely online. Still, he does have some valuable insight, so I do not regret purchasing."
2,Poor Navigation,The Index does not allow locating a specific book and chapter such as 1 John 1:1 or even 1 John. This renders this cumberson and difficult to use. Needs a better navigation system.
1,a quick look,The printing was SO SMALL our OLD eye could not read it easilyand sadly had to return it.
5,Great Commentary for the Lay Person,"I have used the Matthew Henry commentary for a number of years. The Kindle version is a wonderful tool for study by all people, including the regular lay person. While it is not as through as many commentaries, it is still very good, very accurate, and very reliable. It is also fairly easy to navigate with good notes. The Kindle version works quite well and is well worth the price. I use this almost weekly in my sermon preparation and it is a good starting point for any serious study to be used for personal use, or Sunday School or teaching time, even sermon prep."
2,"*Very, Very, Very Sophisticated!!! Be careful. *","The reason behind purchasing this particular commentary was behind customer reviews. Considering now that I am another number, we failed to mention that this commentary is overly complex, make sure to have a dictionary. My personal opinion, I think if you're at the retirement point of your life this is perfect for you. Because Great is your Reward in the Kingdom of Heaven. Those who prey more but does less fasting and Meditating, should spend time looking for yourself instead of trying to find the easy way out. Just recently I went to Borders Books and Music (Library), and bought The New Matthew Henry Commentary for 29.99; it's less sophisticated and well published when getting its point across."
5,mathew henry kindle commentary,"whoever arranged this kindle edition did an outstanding job!!!the arrangement of commentary and scripture is super, as well as the versatility of going back and forth between commentary and scripture.GOOD JOB to either amazon, kindle, or whoever did this!!!"
5,as promised,"this large book (2000 pgs) came in a1 condition-as if i took it down from the bookshelf myself. however, it did arrive 2 days later than promised, but in all honestly i believe it was the fault of the local postal service."
4,Very Good - Well Written,"This commentary is well written and has good insight into what the bible verses could mean. My only disappointment is that they are not broken down into single verse explanations. Other than that, it is still very informative. I've already used it in some of my school reports."
5,Excellent!,Well I bought this book becuase I wanted to learn more about how to study the Bible. As i read the bible I also read the commentaries and it helps me understand much more. I do suggest buying a type of magnifier because the print is small. Also I bought it because i didn't know e-sword exicted;) But I don't regret my buy.
5,THE BEST,"The finest commentary available for our beloved Word of God. In his book, 'Delighting God,' D. James Kennedy states, ""This classic of devotional commentary on the Scripture has stood the test of time and led thousands of people to a closer relationship with God. Charles Spurgeon, the great preacher of England, said he used to read it continually. George Whitefield, largely responsible along with Jonathan Edwards for the Great Awakening here in America in the eighteenth century, said that he had read the entire six volumes of 'Matthew Henry' through four times.""(77). I can think of no greater endorsement."
4,Every home should have this set of commentaries!,"I only gave it only four stars because the letters are so tiny. Otherwise, this is a very great set of commentaries. This set of books have been very helpful to me when I prepare my sermons. The Lord certainly gifted Matthew Henry in writing these commentaries. As a result, we too can be blessed by reading them! While you may not agree 100% with what he says, you will surely appreciate his deep thoughts on scripture. This is definately one of my top three favorite set of commentaries!"
2,Poorly Published... but still great writing,"This is a great commentary, a great tool to help study God's word. But I find it very difficult to read this with such small text. And to go back and forth from another book is almost impossible. I will be looking for a quality multi-volume set to replace this."
2,Matthew Henry's Commentary on the Whole Bible,The book might be very informative but who can read it? The type is so small that one needs a magnifying glass!I'm returning it because it's useless to me except to use it to press flowers!
2,Don't Buy,"This is more like a kids study Bible, for the visually impaired.The font is HUGE and the explanations are very bland.I wish i would have spent a little more to get a decent commentary."
5,"Biting, insightful, way ahead of his time.","These are 25 Ron Cobb Drawings (rcd25 - get it?) from his work at the LA Free Press. His cartoons of ecological destruction, racism, war-mongering rulers and totalitarian police are as relevant today as they were then, although his bitterness and anger feels out of place in our current times of rueful bemusal over the destruction of our society and the planet."
1,Junk,My aunt used his product and found it to be completely useless. There are no magic bullets. The best we have today is Belviq. As your doctor about it. It'll be on the market probably January 2013 -- it's FDA approved.
5,Lost but not forgotten,"While living in Japan in the early 90's, I received this book from a friend, and read it numerous times during my 2 1/2 years there. As I haven't had the chance to read the book in recent years...can't dig one up in libraries or bookstores--though I live in Guam, which IS a little off the beaten path...I remember it as being very thought-provoking--most notably for its treatment of all the DIFFICULTIES, rather than on the ADVANTAGES that one would usually focus on. I was impressed with how the author dealt with the technical facets of the condition--for example, walking in the rain would create a ""rain sillouette,"" and walking across any pliant surface would leave visible footprints. A little side note: visiting friends in Japan after a 5-year absence (while laboriously making my way to Guam) I went back to my squallid little apartment there for the SPECIFIC PURPOSE of trying to locate this book, which I'd inexplicably left behind. Good book, love to read it again."
2,View of a dissenting minority of one,"I almost called a halt after the author's gratuitous sex scene and his silly and contrived caricature of a left-wing terrorist group, but I plodded on. And on. I always try to get at least the first 100 pages under my belt before I draw a conclusion. As I turned the pages faster and faster, I realize I was bored silly by the laborious descriptions and the tedious dialogue. I figured the remaining 200+ pages would probably be no different. Perhaps all these enthusiastic reviewers have more patience than I do, but I'm still a bit surprised that so many people wanted to wade through this literary swamp populated by a most unsympathetic character."
5,A great addition of any bookshelf,"This marriage of poetry and illustrations is like no other. As an educator I enjoy the layout of the book. The poems are divided into categories such as poems about weather, spooky poems, and animal poems. The illustrations are by Caldecott Medal artists - the best of the best! I have purchased countless copies of Sing a Song of Popcorn as it is a perfect gift to give to families to celebrate the arrival of a new baby. It is a book that all members of the family can enjoy - the young ones will enjoy the rhyming patterns of some of the poems and the silliness of others. The adults will treasure the inclusion of such classic poems as Robert Frost's ""Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening"" and Jack Prelutsky's entertaining ""The Spaghetti Nut""."
2,Windigo Twilight or Darkness?,"Having read some of this author's other books, I was disappointed when I read this one. First, the author seemed to want us to follow the beliefs of the American Indians. I have known many American Indians and Christian missionaries to the Indians all of my life. I know that they would have been disturbed about the spirituality of this book. It is one thing to enlighten the reader; it is another to accept those beliefs into Christ's message. Secondly, the plot and actions in this book seemed to be contrived and plodding. The story went on and on and - o-n."
4,good textbook for those interested in strawbale building.,"I've gotten most of the strawbale books Amazon has, this is one of the better ones to own.I'm still in the process of reading it but I've found this book to be a sort of textbook for the person interested in the idea of possibly building a strawbale home. Looks like everything imaginable is covered, from all sorts of building details and construction methods to dealing with financing and zoning issues.I don't see it as providing all the information an uneducated, inexperienced builder would need but you will find out enough to get started or to know that you don't want any part of the idea. There were lots of little details and tips, extensive end chapter notes, even a lot of photographs. Most of these were black and white (a little too small and indistinct for me)but some were in color.While it isn't all you need it is a book worthy of your attention and worth owning."
5,"This rewrites the prior Straw Bale Building handbook, covering the entire process of building a bale structure","Years ago straw bale building was considered a radical innovation: today it's developed into a major construction choice widely practiced in North America. Such homes are easy to build, very energy efficient, affordable and attractive - and over the years the specs and methods for building them have changed. That's why any considering straw bale home construction would do well to update their facts with More Straw Bale Building: A Complete Guide To Designing And Building With Straw by the expert team of Chris Magwood, Peter Mack and Tina Therrien. This rewrites the prior Straw Bale Building handbook, covering the entire process of building a bale structure from choosing bales and developing building plans to roofing, plumbing and code compliance."
3,so far it is okay,I've read two other straw bale home books. This one hasn't offered that much new to me yet. Maybe it's time I go build one and stop reading about building them.
4,Coming of Age Stories,"SUGAR IN THE RAW is an inspiring collection of essays written by 15 African American young women who, as the backcover asserts, ""refuse to be ignored.""These girls may share a racial ancestry but their stories are as unique as they are. This thin volume contains essays from young women of all walks of life: from a bisexual homegirl in Portland trying to keep it together to a biracial girl in lily white Vermont coming to terms with who she is, the reader of SUGAR will share in all the girl's excitement, fears and triumphs.The only drawback is the the book is so short. The editor interviewed over 90 girls from around the country but only 15 are included here. SUGAR can be easily read in one sitting and will leave you wanting more. Hopefully, a SUGAR II is in the works.All in all, this book would make a great gift for a young woman of any race."
1,Please dont waste your money on this,This toy is not any good compared to other reviews about this toy from differnt online stores. I dont have this. I use to want this but when I found out its no good i dont want it anymore. Im telling you now so you dont waste your money your going to be dissapointed.
3,good product slow process,It took about 3 months to finally get this.Several promises of delivery that were not met.The product itself is good.
1,Unbelievable,"I can not believe how badly this shawer works, or maybe i should say DOES NOT WORK. I keep thinking i'm doing something wrong because it is impossible that someone could launch a product that doesn't even come close to doing something it's meant to do, let alone do it well, but i tried everything the manual says. I will give it one more chance with new inner blades but i doubt that will change anything, it should have worked right now since it's new. This is a disgrace for Panasonic. Stay away from this product."
1,Cheap shaver,"Real cheap shaver, dont buy. Get a three headed shaver instead for a better more comfortable shave"
3,not so cheap here,"Bought one in Marshalls as 30$ only. Works OK. Checked and read some others' review from Internet and people were disappointed with the Timmer since it barely does its work. The razor itself works fine, though, based on my experience."
2,I'm Disappointed,I had bought an electric shaver about 7 years ago and it wasn't that great even though it was one of the more expensive ones. Lately I had gotten interested in them again because of the convenience and hoped that over the years they've gotten better. What I found is that using it is actually more of a hassel than my disposable Gillette razors.The battery life doesn't last long and when it's 'dying' it slows down significantly so you don't get quite the shave you should be. It also misses some spots and the shave is not as close as you would get with a typical razor. It actually takes me longer to shave with this thing.Now I'm back to using the disposable blue Gillette razors. They do the job and anything closer and you'll be drawing blood. They're cheap enough to toss guilt-free when they start to get dull.
1,Panasonic ES4026CMB Shaving Combo,"Only used for 4 months, charged it for about 12 times. Now the battery is dead for recharge. Passed the return date. A piece of junk now."
2,This is a toy,"This razor is a toy. It is flimsy and works poorly. It takes 3 times as long to shave with this than any other electric razor I have ever owned. It does not come with a power cord, it uses a wall plug that the unit sits on. The electrical outlets in my bathroom are horizontal instead of vertical so I must use an outlet in another room to charge it. I gave it two stars because it is waterproof and the nose trimmer works well."
2,Something wrong,Other Panasonic items I had that are made in Japan are greatI don't believe this one was since it was much less expensiveEven when new it doesn't trim very close and had a hard time cutting also.Automatic bath/washer stop working after a few months.
3,Not for International Travel,Rated for 100-120 V not for the 220 V found in other parts of the world. Returned it without ever using it!
1,Does not work as expected,This electric shaver does not shave properly. My husband tried it several times over the same spot and the skin was rubbed raw as opposed to the hair getting any shorter. I'm in th eprocess of returning it.
3,Not my son's favorite game...,"My son (6 yrs.) has receive a few games for his gameboy, and this was not one of his favorites. He liked the backyard football and the Matchbox racing and other games better. This game is only average."
1,"Origins? Oh, please.","This author has one heck of a writing style. It's all over the place! He appears to be a well informed guy, but he's very hard to follow. He uses lots of dashes, parentheses, and notes about other chapters. Plus, there are many overuses of words such as ""insofar"" and ""per se,"" which disrupt the entire flow of reading. It is not what I expected at all and am pretty disappointed."
3,Power Issues,"Many USB hubs are self powered - that means they draw all of the electricity they need in order to operate from the USB cable you connect from your computer to the hub. This USB hub actually has a power supply, yet it sporadically shuts off due to ""strain on the hub"" i.e. plugging in too many self-powered items which requires you to restart your computer before it will recognize the hub again. To put this into perspective, my setup includes a USB keyboard, USB CF card reader, and USB2 HD with power source. I occasionally use the top-loading port for my thumb drive. I found out later that this hub maxes out at 2 devices without a power adapter. Needless to say, I never thought I'd have power issues with this hub. I've had this thing for over two years and this is the only real complaint."
5,Lightweight,"Light, simple and cheap. The AC adaptor must be use only if you connect many devices. The ports could be a little less close."
1,Not very good,Some devices work when plugged into the hub and others don't. I don't know what the problem is and when a person stops using something because it is more trouble than it is worth then it is a waste of money. Look around before picking this one up.
4,4:3 TV flat screen,Fit my needs nicely - a bedroom TV that does not have black unused borders for cable TV. I don't subscribe to HD so why have a widescreen taking up space! Unit does a good job - a few too many setup options but since I can use it in a vehicle too I guess someday I'll need them. 12' viewing distance works out well - any further and screen would be too small for program menu info. Took a little looking to find right code for FIOS remote! Nice unit for the price!!
3,Past its prime,"Instructors considering this text for adoption should be aware that, despite the virtues Professor Kendall notes, it is quite long in the tooth. The most significant problem is with text selection; this volume does not contain a single syllable written by major playwrights like Aphra Behn or Susanna Centlivre. The text also looks dated; this is essentially a facsimile reproduction of a text from the early twentieth century, and while the typeface is readable, it is rather ugly. There are a few short essays providing backgrounds from theater history, but these are brief and, unfortunately, are not illustrated.Anthology options for this period are limited, but Broadview provides a more up-to-date selection of plays, and Norton's collection of Restoration comedies has more useful contextual material."
5,This book is needed if you want to improve your memory,"This book is about mind map, a method to maximise the potential of our brain. This book contains many example, the book also have many easy instruction. This book tells us how to use mind map in different case, such as for study, for management, for diary, etc. This book is very great, it really can make me study faster and my grades increase. I would reccomend this book for secondary high school student to adult."
5,Real Rock Music,"At last, a band thats doin real rock music. Old school rock meets the new kid in da groove. I just love those guitars. Luv ya guys. Cheers for MOtHer SuPEriOr."
4,Science,"It is a very colorful book and full of great science information and I can see it being a very usefull book. Covers a vast amount of science topics briefly. Good overall, but not as in depth as I had hoped for."
3,Thanks!,The condition of the book was described acurately in the description. Thanks for prompt shipment. :)
4,Amazon has incorrect track listing for the Japanses release,"Amazon has conflicting information on this listing that I would like to clear up. The product description is CORRECT in ststaing that this is the 18 track Japanese pressing. The track listing is INCORRECT, stating that there are 22 songs. The 22 song version is the more exspensive Korean version (that Amazon also has conflicting information for). Just thought I'd clear this up.As for the album, I was pleasantly surprised. Not being a huge fan of AWK's other 2 albums, I was expecting more of the same. WRONG. There are so many more sounds this album. Lots more instruments and better song arrangements. I was definitely not expecting this out of him but I'm glad to see some progression. You can only sing about partying for so long I guess."
4,Great CD!,"I got this for Christmas & it is my favorite Grease CD (I have 21 Grease CD's & that is including 6 broadway cast recordings) It is 98% English. There is dialoge spoken befoure Those Magic Changes & We Go Together. For some reason there is NO Teen Angel in this so they have Vince Fontaine sing ""Beauty School Dropout"". What I don't like is the spoken part of ""It's Raining On Prom Night"" is in GERMAN while the spoken part on ""Sandy"" is in English. There is 24 tracks on this CD. The English translation of the CD title is: Grease the musical live! : Austrian first performance."
3,Mini coffee table book,"Shiny and pretty, has some real and good info, but is presented in a coffee table book style. A bit small for that application though. I guess in a compact space..."
2,Printed in China,"If you don't know why you shouldn't buy a book printed in China, then maybe this is not the book you should be reading."
4,Great Book on Golden Ratio,This is a detailed and well-illustrated intro to the golden ratio and related topics. There's only so much to be said about these things and this book touches on most of them. Signature of design in nature and man's creations. See alsoThe Golden Section: Nature's Greatest Secret (Wooden Books).
1,Not what i thought!,this book was not what i had thought it would be! i am hindu and i LOVE wearing mehind! i really like to show my religon to my friends and to know what the different deigns mean! unless this book was based on a true experience i think that this book was very selfish and dissaponting!
5,I don't have joint pain anymore! SO far!,I read a research article about this in July and decided to give it a go. It worked from the first pill to the last pill. I went through the bottle in less than a month. Guess what? It's November tomorrow and I haven't had to reorder this yet. Absolutely amazing. Thank you God for your little treasures.
3,kid friendly,"I ordered this to accompany a dollhouse I picked up at a Goodwill. It arrived in good time. It was brand new and every figure was individually wrapped neatly in the box. A very good product, especially for children. Very durable and uniquely detailed."
3,review,"the people are stick people. they dont move. theyare to be playable in a doll house, sitting inchairs, etc. They dont move, so their not muchfun."
1,Waste of money,"I wish I read the reviews first before buying this item. I too did not realize that the family does not bend and I had bought this for my 6 year old to go with a large sized house (which she can also use with her barbies) as it's in the suggestions to buy it with the house. Why would these miniture sized, stiff, non-bending family be suggested for this house is beyond me. Now I will be giving it to my one year old to play with. He won't mind and my daughter won't be disappointed when I go to buy different dolls for it."
1,"I Agree with ""Disappointed""","I to purchased these to be used for a doll house for my nieces. The figures do not bend. This reduces their enjoyment with this product and should have been included in the product description. Compared to other like products they are also over priced, considering they do not bend and are frustrating for small children. How can children pretend/learn with a doll if it can't be doing anything but stand?"
3,The blended family,"These figures are OK. But it would have been nice if they had moving arms and legs and knees. They could not ""sit"" at the table in the 'dollhouse'."
2,Tiresome and Judgmental,"I bought this book with high hopes and felt guilty for not liking it. Brill establishes a narrow range of acceptable choices for gay-headed households, and passes judgment on everything from what kids should call parents to whether or not to affiliate with a mainstream church or synagogue. It is also repetitive and emphasizes the obvious: that parents have to be out and secure in their identity in order to raise happy & healthy kids. Every time I haven't read it in a while, I'll pick it up again, only to remember how much I hate it and cast it aside in annoyance.I gave it two stars instead of one because 1) hey, it's something and there's not much out there, and 2) sometimes bad books inspire other authors to write better ones."
1,Try Again,"How very important the subject matter; how very disappointing the outcome of this project. The first portion of the title is misleading. It is not a primer. There is absolutely no discussion of adoption, alternative means of starting a family, legal issues for gay men and lesbians, etc. There is a fair amount of information for lesbian couples, but even that is a warmed over rehash of self-help group discussions. This is not a book for a gay person longing to be a parent. One can only hope that someone else will move rapidly to fill the void this book only skirts."
5,Great learning tool,The chart is just as it was pictured and the delivery was prompt. I am happy with this purchase and would order again.
3,Satisfied buyer,"I was happy to receive this poster sooner than expected. I like that it is colorful and it grabs my grandson's attention. The one thing I am not happy with is the book, Song of Solomon is listed as Song of Songs. I don't know if that is a misprint or they just changed the title of that book of the bible. I am keeping the poster because it was a good price, just marking out that title and changing it."
1,Excrutiatingly boring,"Unbearably earnest writing. Depressing characters. Rape. Incest. Stereotypes. Lots of peeing and descriptions of toilets. Constant reminders that the narrator is well-endowed. Hackneyed, ""I found my mother's diary, wow she had secrets, but she still loves me"" approach. This book has them all. Morbidly uninteresting, supposedly successful and empowered, old widowed female returns to scene of dreary, boring life and finds it (surprise, surprise) dreary and boring and drags us down with her. Gets her thrills in how unsuccessful everyone else around her has been and wonders why no one likes her. Yeah, there's a crime in there somewhere, but by the time you have waded through all the character issues, you really don't care anymore. The most exciting thing about this book was being able to return it to the library."
4,Fun for a two-year-old,"My son has enjoyed this set thus far. The overall quality is okay. They're not Matchbox or Hot Wheels, but they're decent. A bigger variety of hook and ladder type fire trucks would have been nice, but the set has a good mix of other vehicles."
1,Poor quality - NYC Fire Department should be ashamed to give their stamp of approval,"These trucks are really poor quality - parts break off easily, and they're not cheap compared to other cheap die-cast toys. The New York City Fire Department should be ashamed to license their name to such junk."
3,Cool NYC play set,Nephew totally loved the gift! He's 2 and was loving the play station. Took a few minutes to put all together - not the world's most durable toy but does offer hours of fun.
2,Waste of my time and money!,"Unless you're one of those fans who insist on owning EVERY Bush item that goes on the market, I wouldn't recommend this book. I've looked through it all of twice in the MONTHS I've had it, and both times I found myself utterly disgusted that I had paid for such an item! The book itself is extremely small! The words are small and often hard to read do to poor page layout, most of the pictures are small and blurry, and I found several cases where the author listed wrong information about the members of the band. If you're looking for a good Bush book, I recommend the ones by Peter Black."
1,Pitiful,"Seriosly poor quality. Utter tripe. Awfully written (a bit like their songs) mediocre photography. I hate Bush, but now i want them dead. God awful. Ergh! Sickening."
5,"Great, classic Disney fun!","The original Disney smash Freaky Friday features a clever storyline, stellar production and extremely talented cast, including a young Jodie Foster (always a brilliant actress in whatever she's in) in a role which proves she can portray a suburban mother in mind convincingly. An over-the-top performance of the mother by Barbara Harris is executed almost as convincingly. The latest version rivals this because both contain many comedic elements and brilliant acting. A classic for Disney which can be enjoyed by all!"
5,Freaky Friday,Any Parents with Teenagers ?Well this is a great movie and is suitable for the whole Family.Great fun and amusing !!!
5,Freaky Friday,"Love this old movie. Quite the classic. I enjoyed it a lot, but actually thought the newer one was more funny!"
1,Annoying.,"Although it was nice to see the historical aspect of this film, it was pretty demeaning to women, and frankly, men as well. Poor acting and slapstick will go over well with children, but will only grate on their parents' nerves."
3,Freaky Friday (1977),"This version is a cute movie, but I like the 2003 remake with Lindsay Lohan better because there is more action in it."
1,They lied,They said it was like new but they ran through a scrubber and it still hung up and wouldn't read right
4,A Good Deck Shovel,"I purchased this shovel for the expressed purpose of clearing my deck of snow. It has already done an excellent job once this year. I picked this pusher style to avoid the back strain caused by shovels that make you lift and turn. I've been told by my doctor that the lifting and turning motion of conventional snow shoveling is the worst thing that you can do to your back; so, no more of that.The shovel is apparently well made and robust. The blade is heavy ribbed plastic with a metal wear strip on the lip, the shaft seems to be extruded aluminum and the handle is heavy plastic.The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that, considering it's a pusher shovel, the handle should have been made wide enough to accommodate two gloved hands. This way you could push evenly with both hands - I didn't realize this beforehand. Not a big problem though. Otherwise, it's fine."
5,Mm-mmm! Mango-ey.,"This is the best of the Goya jams for my money. Not cloyingly sweet, but sweet. Not overwhelmingly aromatic, but undeniably mango. A judicious dab on toast gives a happy start to the day without kicking the calorie count. Clever wife makes a tangy-sweet salad dressing with lemon juice, mango jam and some other magical incantations or stuff. Nice going Goya."
3,Nice story could have been better,I liked Dig and Nadine two just turned thiry year olds trying to figure out why they are still single with no serious special person on the horizon.You soon realize even if they don't they are perfect for each other and then enters each ones first loves. Delilah and Phil are back in their lives and they have to sort out their emotions and feelings for each other.Here is where it could have been better. The author spent somuch time building up the conflict between Dig and Nadine over their first loves I got bored and skipped some chapters to get to the good stuff.And boy were there some good stuff building in the second half of the book. If you can hold hold out for the second half you will enjoy the book. the writting is good but I thought this book could have been better if the first have of the book was shorter.
3,Doesn't Live Up,"Jewell's debut book Ralph's Party was a stunner... one of my favourite books. I had expected Thirty-Nothing to stun me too, but it didn't live up. I know it might be horrible of me to compare it to Ralph's Party, but there are definite similiarities that I just can't shake off.The plot of 30nothing turns out to be pretty predictable, slightly worn. It's a pleasure to read, but it's nothing engaging, or worth a lot of commitment. Read it when you're not in the mood to throw yourself into a book."
3,Mixed Feelings,"I liked the overall story, but felt it was a bit too British. There were so many references to London neighborhoods, cuisine, and slang, it was sometimes distracting to what turned out to be a nice story. I have been reading a lot of this type of book, and this has been the only one I found so peppered with references to the London lifestyle it became distracting. I'm sure it won;t bother everyone, but it did lessen my overall interest in the story."
4,Turning Thirty,It's has a taste of When Harry Met Sally. The characters are so real that you did not want the story to end when you are finished with the book. A must read....very enjoyable.
2,"Sorry, Didn't Get It or Care","I loved Ralph's Party so of course I had to read this sophmore effort. Talk about your sophmore slumps! Obvious from the beginning but worse yet not an enjoyable journey to the inevitable. Dig and Nadine weren't even likable characters, their machinations were predictable and the plot thin, if not implausible. I didn't enjoy the long flashbacks, I found them disruptive. Glimpses of their teenage years with more adult reflection would have been more effective. The major plot device that brought about the conclusion is just plain hackneyed.Read Ralph's Party, skip this one and hopefully her next book will be as good as the first!"
2,So-So,"I was disappointed by this book because there was no mystery to how it would end. It was formulaic and run-of-the-mill. I know the premise of the book was basically spelled out in the reviews but it was not as funny or creative as I thought it would be. Even if you're looking for light fare, this book is silly."
3,Fluffy,"I picked this one up at the library because I needed something light to read after my finals. And light is exactly what I got.I won't get into a summary here as enough reviewers have done that already. I will agree with what another reviewer said-- using rape as a plot point in this book was just...wrong.It was painfully obvious right from the beginning that Dig and Nadine would end up together....and it almost wasn't necessary to read the middle part of the book. I found myself skimming some parts, just knowing that Dig's love for Delilah wouldn't go anywhere, and knowing that he would eventually realize that he loved Nadine.Not a bad read, if you're looking for something light."
3,A Good Story,"I found Thirtynothing to be a good story in search of a little dramatic tension. While I enjoyed reading it, I found at times that there was nothing to propel me on, nothing to keep me up late at night reading. But that's my major complaint about the book. Otherwise, it's an enjoyable story that, although you can pretty much tell where the story will ultimately go if you are a fan of romantic comedies, takes all sorts of unexpected turns and is filled with some interesting characters. While not quite as good as Ralph's Party, it is still an enjoyable, quick, light and sometimes funny read."
4,Funny modern romance,"Nadine and Dig are best friends who are perfect for each other, but unfortunately, their romantic timing has never worked out. As Dig turns 30, it looks like this finally might change, but then Delilah, Dig's high school girlfriend, suddenly reappears, and all of the problems she caused for Dig and Nadine in high school resurface. What follows is the usual story of miscommunication and missed chances, but of course, there's also the usual happy ending.Although the general plot is familiar, there are some surprises, particularly with respect to the character of Delilah. In addition, author Jewell writes with both humor and warmth, which keeps the story interesting (her next book, One Hit Wonder, is even better). Overall, a good light read if you enjoy reading about the mishaps of modern romance."
4,Fun read!,"It was a joy to follow Dig and Nadine through their mixed up relationships!! Following them on their road to discovering their true relationship with each other gave hope to all of us who desire a deep relationship. Luckily for them, they realize their friendship is the basis for a deeper relationship. Very entertaining!"
2,Vapid nonsense,"I should start by saying two things: I love British comic novels, and I'm approaching the age of the main characters of this book. Therefore, it seemed like a natural read for me. I found myself extremely disappointed at how vapid the characters were, even for books of this type. What's more, there isn't a sympathetic character in the book--you will be shouting yourself hoarse every time they make a stupid decision (which is about every other page). For a fluffy book like this to work, there has to be something to like about the protagonists--there just isn't here.I became tired of this book long before it ended. If this sounds like a book you might enjoy, skip it and read ""Confessions of a Shopaholic"" instead. It's in the same genre and features an intensely likeable, if somewhat scatterbrained, heroine."
2,Good writing-ludicrous plot,"Lisa Jewell is a very good writer, but the premise and the execution of this story is just dumb. The background stories of Dig's and Nadine's friendship and Delilah's troubled past are credible. However, the path of their two-week romantic realization of love after ten years of friendship is utterly unbelieveable. Plus, while Dig's character is fleshed out, Nadine's character feels unappealingly spliced together."
1,very tepid,"I have to disagree with most reviews I find here. Don't expect any fantastic writing or surprise ending. The ending was sweet, but predictable from almost the get-go & the writing is just okay. This book can't hold a candle to BRIDGET JONES or even THE GIRLS' GUIDE TO HUNTING AND FISHING. Read it for fun, if you must -- maybe if you're a thirtysomething & single. If not, pass on it for something better."
3,"pretty funny, entertaining...not amazing though","well, i am addicted to all books brit. and this was on my list. and i found bits hilarious...and the mere mention of robbie williams sprinkled throughout gave it another star. the best part of this book was the middle, i could deal without the beginning or the end...in fact the end, kinda stunk. i hate those epilogues...where everything is just so perfectly movie-made. the same thing happened when i read amanda's wedding. the conclusion you thought would happen, happened but as bland as you could get."
3,Slow but cute.....,The book tended to be slow and a little predictable. It was cute with a happy ending but I wasn't that satisfied.
5,A Wonderful Journey !!,Thirty Nothing is one of those books where you know how it is going to end but the journey is so much fun that you can't stop reading. I found this to be an incredibly fun read !!
2,Pretty dumb,"Dig and Nadine are great characters -- people I'd want as friends -- but boy, the plot is silly. I also found it a bit galling that a book this fluffy would use a rape as a plot point. And, as other reviewers have said, you can tell what's going to happen at the end just by reading the cover. If you like contemporary British fiction you're way better off with Nick Hornby."
2,"Boring, Barely Average","I don't get why people love ""Anytime You Need a Friend"". It pales in comparison to ""Hero"" or ""One Sweet Day"". It's boring and way too long."
5,VERY COOL,I don't have the maxi single but I downloaded the Soul Convection Remix of Anytime You Need a Friend and it is very cool! Mariah has amazing vocals and this is one of her best remixes.
2,2 stars,"Okay, there weren't any of those ""problems"" in this one that get solved by a paragraph of explanation (my usual complaint about this author's stories), but there really wasn't a coherent plot either.The actual romance could have been a short story, not even a novella--and Indian boy and a white girl are friends as children; they vow eternal love at ages 14 and 10; then his parents are killed by her stepfather and he runs off. Eleven years later, they're reunited when she's driving a stagecoach disguised as a man.There are other plot threads filling out the novel, like buttons made out of human bones, and an evil white man who kidnaps her, but nothing's really connected.The characters are all 2-dimensional stereotypes, and boring as heck.On the plus side, the chapters are short, and the font is big, and I got through this one in record time."
4,A century later it works.,"The study of price as it relates to volume is IMO the most necessary info to know in trading. Wykoff is the father of such studies and he hasn't been inproved on except in charting technology. However charting has greatly improved in it's ability to pinpoint where volume enters the market. Therefore, RW's pictures of tape readings and exhortations to record time and sales can be passed over in lieu of volume histograms.Great bang for the buck."
2,"Good opening, but has nothing to do with Tape Reading really..","It started off with some good personal growth tips for trading......but it really had less to do with Tape Reading, and a lot more to do with Charts and Levels......no mention of 'hammers', block orders,lock ups, or basic 'footprints' of major players/market makers,etc......also, not good for Kindle."
1,Not sure the title is appropriate anymore,Interesting reading if only for the history of it. Did not manage to pick anything that would be applicable to today's markets unfortunately. I would suggest that people interested in tape reading continue looking.
4,BBQ Time,"I admit I only picked this set because of the beer bottle opener. The tools have been used quite a few times and are sturdy. I did put the corn on the cob holders through the dishwasher and the wood faded a bit... but oh well it is going to fade over time. Case durability doesn't seem that great but it works for me since I just leave the case sit out on my bench during the season. Will hide it in the off season. I wouldn't let this case sit in direct sunlight. I wanted a set to include a brush and the metal kabobs will save money down the road. Very nice, and yes the bottle opener does work!"
2,Bases is good but failure to execute,"The Prince of Shadow begins by drawing you into the story and then drops the ball. It's setting felt like it was trying to get you to see the story in a Genghis Khan time period yet besides the name most of it feels like it was written from a more European medieval era. Allowing for this flaw I moved on and met all the main characters. After finishing the book I still did not feel any connection to the deposed prince Llesho nor his band of companion. Llesho comes off as a heroic brat who constantly breaks down and don't think about his situation. For the other characters they come and go without giving you much about themselves or their character. They are basically just there to move the story along and when they are finished, they are killed.The story would have been better if the author put more effort in developing his characters and actually use Asian them instead of just putting it as a cream over the real European skin."
4,Very good read!,"I just finished this book and have to agree with many of the other reviewers that it is a must read for fantasy fans. The setting has heavy Asian overtones, though there are some European items as well. The characters are good, though I think as a main character Llesho is a little shallow so far, but first books are often the worst of the series. The plot leaves a bit to be desired, with ""luck"" and ""strange benefactor"" prototypes abounding, but last part of the book does a good job of providing (some) answers and laying the basis for the next book. I would definitely recommend you pick it up, as I'm guessing the next book will be even better."
4,"An excellent book, and one that heralds more to come!","At first, this book did not appeal to me very much; the author's descriptions are somewhat amateruish, and the names of his characters over-exotic and difficult to pronounce. However, I suffered through the first few chapters, and before I knew it, I couldn't put the book down! Though the writing itself isn't admirable, the characters and plotline are enough to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the book. We follow Llesho on his journey to attempt to take back his country, so brutally stolen from him and his six older brothers so many years ago. On the way, he meets gods, gathers a coterie of followers, and befriends an emperor. I think we can expect much from Mr. Benjamin, and hope that his writing will develop as much and as well as his storyline has."
5,Violent women,"An exceptionally well written book on a topic that gets too little attention. The author discusses the various manners in which women exhibit violent behaviour, and how society has come to view violent women differently than violent men. Violence is for the most part a learned trait, one that, while in most cases not as destructive as is the case with men, women are equally capable of resorting to. This book is definitely not an anti-woman tract, but is simply a statement of undeniable fact."
4,An Eye Opener,"This is a very good collection of facts to have on hand. It makes for good reading too. Pearson's main point is that crime won't be well understood until the myth of female innocence is depotentiated. Excellent chapters on female criminality including women who give birth and then kill, women who kill their children later, women who kill family members, nurses who kill, predatory women, women who batter their (male or female) mates, female serial killers, and so on. Excellent accounts of how women use their femininity to avoid prosecution, or to become the preferred perpetrator, who gets first shot at copping for a lesser charge.There is a later edition of this book with the subtitle: How women get away with murder, or something close to that. I have no idea how different the two books are."
1,Junk,"I bought this television in 2006. It was an excellent television for the entire warranty period plus exactly 2 weeks. Then ... poof! The screen goes black. I did an internet search and guess what the number one problem is for these televisions? Yep. Apparently it's the ""inverter board"", which (of course) costs about the price of a new set to fix. So I've got a thousand dollar (2006 price) contribution to the local landfill. Anybody need any TV parts? This is the last Sharp product I will ever buy."
3,Qestionable - Maybe its just Me...,"Well engineered, very compact, very light weight, works on presta and shrader valves, rugged, pumps up fast with minimal effort to suitable pressures - Just one thing wrong - Every time I try to disconnect it I loose my air - Yet I have seen others use this same type pump and mine without difficulty - Operator error? - Yes - Maybe I am just getting to old... (if not for my personal inability to use this pump I would award it a high five) - You may want to look at the Lezyne Pressure Drive Hand Pump or another more conventional Crank Brothers pump that threads onto the valve stem..."
2,Incredibly frustrating,"The first problem with this pump is that while it can be used on presta and schraeder valves, they've marked it so it's never clear when the selector at the top is in the correct position for the type of valve. It's as if they didn't contemplate what would be convenient for the user. The second problem, is that it's hard to get a secure attachment to the valve. And the third problem is that the pump doesn't give you any leverage. So this pump can take you 20 minutes to do what another pump can do in 30 seconds. A poorly conceived tool."
5,STILL ENJOYABLE AFTER ALL THESE YEARS!,"This will be short. It helps if you were a Saturday matinee kid (theater or TV) when young, and these sagebrush heroes, their trusty sidekick(s) and guitars when needed, helped form moral values for at least a couple generations. Gawrsh...it's fun to be a 12 year kid again. If you're new to these oaters it helps to remind yourself that in the days before 500 TV channels, CGI and very little morality examples, kids AND adults enjoyed these simple morality tales and because most ""B"" western stars released about 8 films a year one was never too far off from their ""Hero"" fix. So...you either like these films or you don't...but if you're curious, the source material and transfer are SUPER! Those of us who know what we're getting will be delighted. Those new to the form will perhaps be pleasantly surprised. Golly...NO swearing, NO nudity, No sex...just good vs. evil and lots of noble (non-grey) heroes. One thing I can guarantee...THEY LOOK FANTASTIC! 'Nuff said."
5,The cutest coat!,I am so excited for our baby girl to get here to wear this coat. It is warm and soft. I am very impressed with the quality and style!A must have for a winter baby.
5,Great for smaller speakers,"These speakers are great for those who just need to get better stereo sound out of a computer/laptop without external speakers. I use them with my laptop, and they're small enough to be convenient for travel, but powerful enough to not sound tinny. The range of sound they produce is fantastic, though you can't expect to get loud, deep bass out of speakers without a subwoofer. They're ideal for home office or workplace use. Also, I've been using them for 5 months now on a daily basis, and they have not lost any sound quality at all. A great buy!"
3,Average/good for price,"Not very loud, music quality is just okay not great by any means. I'm sure there are better speakers out there but this is okay based on it's price. Good for office desk / privacy kinda music."
5,Flawless so far,"While this dispenser costs several times more than the one it replaces, it is also much more sturdy with what appears to be much higher quality parts. The low profile also looks more appealing than its taller predecessor. The short pump action dispenses less liquid than the taller HD brand and this is a good thing. Also, the capacity of the bottle that sits under the sink is, I believe, 16 oz and several ozs greater than brand HD. Overall, this is a very nice quality product that I expect will hold up significantly better than the $20 dispenser I got at the 'Depot'."
1,Extremely disappointed,I am used to writing stellar reviews about Moen products but this one is a dud. The dispenser is poorly designed and is barely able to dribble soap into my kitchen sink. The dispensing mechanism is wobbly and feels like a cheap knock-off. Having paid a lot for this dispenser it is a big disappointment.
4,Good replacement,This dispenser is a replacement for our's that had broken from a VERY expensive Moen faucet combo. I needed help installing it since one person needed to be under the sink behind the disposal and one person needed to help thread it from above. It's the closest match that Moen offers but does a fairly good job at matching. It functions as expected and I sure hope it lasts longer than its predecessor.
2,Too big for bicylce cables,"This might be my mistake. Thought these would be good for my MTB cables, but they are way too large in diameter. I used one anyway but it's obviously to big and doesn't look right."
5,Just what I needed,"I needed to shorten some cables on my bike and these worked perfectly. I cut the cable housing with wire cutters, belt sanded the ends flat, deburred the inside with an awl and added one of these ferrules to the end before reinstalling.Easy-Peasy, Lemon Squeezy."
4,A good guide for beginning,This book has great illustration and instruction for patio construction. It guides me step by step. I like this book a lot!
4,Bamboo Catfisher Our Cats Love It,"Our two bengal cats love this toy. They can play with it for hours (until we get tired of casting). They will sit next to it and stare at it. Sometimes the fishing wire will get tangled up but we just unscrew the base from the lid and fix it. Simple as that. If you are really in a bind with fixing the wire all the time, simply cut the string to its bare minimum shortest w/out compromising the cast of the line (i.e. don't cut too much off but leave just enough to cast a few yards) and re-attach your cat fisher toy. That should take care of the problem as well."
3,"Fun product, but needs a little tweaking!","This product is a lot of fun. It is true, however, that it breaks easily. The fishing line that is used is too fine and takes on the curl of the reel too easily. This leads to tangling. We were able to fix it when this occurred, but I'm sure it will occur again. We have had it for about a week, have used it 3-4 times, for up to 20 minutes each session and only had the one breakdown. It takes a few practice casts to keep from hitting the ceiling with the mouse (which of course made the kitten fly from the room) but it was pretty easy to get the hang of it. The kitten loves it!"
1,just buy the replacement mice. forget the reel,"I had gotten two of these and shortly after they were both broken. The reel is sitting in my cabinet in hopes that I will fix it, but I found that a child's rod and the replacement mice work the best. In fact, I ordered 4 packs of the replacement mice because my cats really liked playing with even without the rod. The mice are now packaged in packs of 3 instead of 4 even though it says different on the website. I'm disappointed that the company hasn't fixed the defect in the toy, but perhaps it was meant so people would replace a great cat toy. Sorry to say, other than the mice (which can't really break) I won't be buying any of their cat toys."
1,DANGEROUS TOY!!!!,"This is a fun toy except it has one MAJOR problem. My kitty got the fishing wire wrapped around his neck and it scared the heck out of him!!!The poor guy hissed and ran around with the toy dragging behind him which only made it tighter, and it didn't break right away. I had to catch him and break the line myself and he was so scared of it we threw it away immediately.This is a DANGEROUS toy and I do not recommend it!!!"
1,"great idea (cats love it), but does not work well","My cats love this when it is working but, unfortunately, it jams up too easily/frequently. We've spent way too much time (hours and hours) fixing it and now we have thrown it away (after two months). Here is some advice to the distributor if they are reading - fix the design flaw and re-introduce the product. In the meantime, buyer beware: even though your cat will love it, the product will only last a few weeks at best."
1,TWICE BROKEN,"We've tried this toy twice, and BOTH times after 15 minutes of playing with our cats, it has broken. NOT worth the money!!!"
1,too pricey for breaking so easily,"I bought 3 of these things, only to constantly keep fixing them, then tossing them in the trash over the years. I kept hoping it would be made better or improved, but it is always poorly made for the long-haul of reeling in the kitties. The cats definitely love this though, but I'm not buying anymore. It's just too pricey.If you do buy it, be ready with needlenose pliers to take apart the reel and keep fixing it because you'll have to do that. Then there's the black gunk from the grease you'll get all over yourself too. Ugh...I still have one, but can't bring myself to fix it again because of the black gunk I'll get under my nails again."
3,Easy Bluetooth sound(stereo) from any source basically.,"I have had this adapter now for couple of weeks.Excellent device, if you are watching TV at late night and do not want to disturb others who might be at bed already.I am pairing this with Nokia BT-604 headphones, very easy to pair and use. No hazzle.Reach is not long, if there is walls in between, but when there is clear view to adaptor sound is good and reaching long way (like 5-7m. at least).Battery life so far been good. Only recharged it 2 times. At least 8-10 hrs for one re-charge.So, I can recommend this. Reach I would like to be better when there is walls in between."
4,Goood for refurbished tnihg,"Elegantly, light and easy to use, i used with headphones samsung, good, the cable is so thiny , but not a problem, but have to wait a longer use to calified cause is refurbished"
3,Could Have Been Better,Generally a decent read. Suffers from quite a bit of redundancy though. Story idea interesting and the pace is well set. I never fully connected with the characters though.
2,Disappointed,"Generally, I love Christopher Golden's work. But this time, I was sorely disappointed.In general, the other reviews are correct. This story lacks...almost everything. There are a few extremely creepy vignettes that are tacked to a wall, with a thread we could call a story strung between them, but the story is gossamer and weak, and the characters are equally bad. The conflict is intense, but meaningless, and essentially devoid of interest. The setting had personal interest for me, but it was hardly generally viable. Essentially, the book is about a man whose wife goes crazy, and he is trying to save her. Both characters are vapid, uninteresting and act bizarrely.But, there are so many things about the book that never make sense. What does Moloch have to do with anything? Although there are attempts made to answer these questions, they are so superficial that they may as well never have been made.I wouldn't recommend this to...anyone really.Harkius"
2,"Promised a lot, deliver little","Golden starts off his usual manner, creating a mysterious background to his story. But unlike his previous books, this book collapsed dramatically towards the end, and the whole plot becomes to imaginative that it is confusing and lack sparkle.What started from a missing girl unbelievably was linked to ancient curses and the house which stores all the secrets look like houses in fairy tales rather than a horror tale.This was not one of his better one, but with the promised delivered in the beginning, still deserved a 3 star. I will say at least two thirds of the book was still ok, just a bit of anti climax towards the end."
2,too predictable,"I was trying my hardest to be creept out, but like someone said, it read like a pre-teen novel."
3,Hal Borland's back door,"I have really liked some of Hal Borland's books (e.g.""When Legends Die"" & ""A Countryman's Woods""), but this one seems to be missing something for me. It just didn't move me internally in the same way those others did, but ... maybe I expect too much. I know everything about life seems to be in a state of constant flux (AKA ""Nothing ever stays the same"" and ""You can't ever step into the same river twice""), but ... It's still a ""good read."""
1,picture is not what you get ...,so i ordered these and got something else sent to me.AND it's not the company's fault since it was drop shipped from LADYBUG themselves! ... the sellers worked with me and apologized for any error; they are great to work with!! (five stars)the towels are a few inches in width shorter which means it doesn't fit on the ladybug when you fold them in half. ... it's also a bit thinner than the towels that came with the ladybug ... which means that the folding in half would be even more important!be wary of buying these as they are not as usable for your ladybug steamer. ... i'd just go out and buy some bar towels (which i did) at costco for a about $20. you get twice as many ... and i don't feel bad when they get dirty. which they will when you are steaming floors!
3,"This can be for you, as this is NOT for Dummies","Accidental Webmaster is unique at least in two ways. Firstly, it documents the existence of a professional who is probably marginalized in the field of information technology. And secondly, it lays down the path for those who wish to informally improve their skills and manage even a dynamic Website. I would strongly recommend this book to all those who are interested in expanding their Web-based technological initiatives. Some insights in this book are of value even to those who have crossed the accidental stage. Hence, I would recommend this book even for managers and administrators of Web sites."
3,Smaller than it appears,"Somehow the photo makes the earrings appear thicker, wider than they actually are, a disappointment."
3,Good sound and playability. Poor Craftsmanship,"Sounds great even with the low quality strings. I can't comment on the ability of this instruments to stay in tune since the bridge is coming unglued from the body. The bridge was peeling off after about 10 mins of light play! Also the 13thand 14th fret on the high E string are dead! The 15th fret is set higher and the 14th is set lower than the rest. Sighting the neck shows a dip in the fretboard at the dead fret location. If it wasn't for the bridge problem i would keep this guitar. The fret problem could be easily adjusted.I bought this from a Sam Ash store in Sarasota Fl. Look the instrument over very carefully before you purchase. Be sure there are no dead frets and that the joints are glued true! If all is well with the instrument, pick it up and a set of Elixer Strings and you won't be disappointed. For $99 it is a steal!"
3,Thrilling story with a disappointing ending,"The story starts right at the beginning with a murder, Kimmel kills his wife near a bus stop on the highway. There's a second case of death, the one of Clara, Walter's wife, is very similar to the first one, but it isn't Walter who has killed his wife. The whole story around it causes a lot of tension through the whole investigation of the inspector called Corby. His suspicion and his in parts wrong accusations increase the tension more and more.Gradually Walter loses nearly all his friends and the permanent inquiries of Corby make them believe that he has killed his wife.You then hope the clever (but brutal) inspector Corby will find out the truth about Clara's death - but instead of the Kimmel, the second suspect, kills Walter. So the end does not satisfy me."
3,"Nice plot, but a bit long-winded",The idea with the man imaginary imitating the murderer he reads in the newspaper is quite original. Also his struggle with the police officer who thinks he's guilty is nice. But after a while the book gets a bit boring und predictable. The writer seems to get out of ideas. The end is surprising but not very enlightening and does not grade up the story.
4,Great Product,"This is a great addition to my Yakima rack. The cord is a little short. You are only able to lock it around the rear bike, but that should do the trick."
5,Yakima Deadlock Review,Great product custom designed for the Yakima hitch racks. Super easy to use and love the way the bike lock cable hides away into the rack itself. Brilliant.
3,Works well,"This locking set works well with the Yakima Double-Down hitch mounted bike rack. It is definitely needed to secure your entire rack to the hitch as well as the bikes to the rack. There is still an exposed bolt at the hinge of the rack that someone with the right sized wrench could remove - but that still leaves them with only half of a rack and they would still have to cut off the connecting lock. As with most things in life, you are really just keeping honest people honest. If someone really wants to get something, they will find a way no matter what.My only complaint about this lock is that you cannot prevent someone from taking the bike lock out of it's nesting space when not engaged as a lock for your bike. You have to lock it to itself, which renders it's nesting capabilities useless. But it's not a terrible thing. I'd still buy it again - I just think it's slightly poor design when you have a built in nesting space to stow the lock."
3,"good product, but a little bit too short","I purchased this in Amazon marketplace. We used it for our recent camping on Jun/22/2008 from LosAngeles to BigSur (7-hour driving.) The quality is good, and robust. However, with three bikes loaded (I use Yakima KingPin 4,) the cable is too short to connect to the lock. I only cross the cable to the last bike (outmost one,) and need to pull the cable quite hard to connect it to the lock. It is better to add about 3 more inches."
3,Hitch solution,"I see a lot of complaints on the inability to secure the pivot bolt which negates all of the other locks. The easiest solution is to head to your local farm store, or for you city dwellers an RV and trailer centers. They carry locking through pins in various sizes and lengths. Should be a ten minute fix."
3,Affords only partial security,"The dead lock hitch works as advertised. The bike lock cable is not long enough to lock all bikes i you have a 4-bike rack. It is only good for one (maybe 2) bikes.A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. My Yakima rack has a pivot screw that can be easily taken out with any adjustable wrench, allowing the removal of the rack and bikes. There is no available lock for this.A major engineering flaw in my opinion."
4,Pretty good lock system,"It is true that even with the locks you can just remove the pivot bolt and walk away with the bikes and rack. My easy, cheap solution: Use some JB Weld and cover the nut and threads of the bolt. Make sure to wire brush them and clean the surface. After that a wrench won't fit on the end and the bolt is ""welded"" to the nut without any problems with the pivot function. The lock can't get lost, stows in tube and has the same key for both lock parts. A longer cable would make this a near perfect design."
4,Good Beginning Hula DVD,"This DVD does well with teaching the basic foot patterns and hand motions but, it's difficult to learn the dance bcuz the motions aren't mirrored. When the dancer is using her right hand or foot you have to conciously think to do the same instead of mirroring. Overall great DVD with good explanations for the basics."
1,BEAT THE GAME ON YOUR OWN!,"Chrono Trigger is the greatest game ever made, and many will agree with that. It is better than any other RPG out there, even beautiful games such as Final Fantasy 7 & 8. It is going to be rereleased on Playstation by the way, with new anime sequences! But the best part of the game is beating it on your own. LONG LIVE CHRONO TRIGGER!"
4,Scary!,"Always something behind the scenes, This time it's bad. I guess certain people won't be satisfied until there is nothing left of planet earth...."
3,All the HAARP data you could ever want!,"So I have been tossing this whole HAARP conspiracy thing around for a couple years now. It seems that there is a lot of reasons, much like any installation where there is money involved, where some level of secrecy or security is involved. For something like HAARP, having big ominous antennas out in no where Alaska seems to feed the Conspirometer. (my word, patented)Anyway, this website has gathered into one place every published document, including the actual experiments performed, their outcomes, etc...It seems to me like a good place to start. Rather than starting with the fringe, and working backwards. I do find it interesting that how some of the Q & A questions were asked.[...]Check it out! If anyone would be concerned about this place, it would be the tree huggers."
4,Everyone should read this book,"This book is a refreshing change from the usual type of 'conspiracy' investigation -- the author examines all the theories about what HAARP is and what it *might* do -- without bias towards any one explanation. What is clear from the author's comprehensive examination of this bizarre govenrment project is that HAARP really does pose a serious danger, no matter what explanation you believe. Even the ""official"" govenment statements reveal that they plan to use this super-powerful electron array to punch holes through the ozone layer -- just for the sake of some vaugely defined experimental research! HAARP appears to be a classic case of good science gone bad -- and people need to read Mr. Smith's book so they can understand just how dangerous the HAARP project is -- and why they should petition congress to shut it down before serious damage is done to the upper atmosphere."
3,A Shame,"This book raises very valid questions about the HAARP research station, and presents some undoubtedly well researched and convincing evidence, but on occasion this is badly interrpreted. An example of this is concluding that because the same US government agency investigated possible Soviet electromagnetic weapon tests, and runs HAARP, that there is a connection. This is farfetched.The overall style of the book is irritating. The author regularly uses phrases such as ""what is the darned thing!?"" and generally expresses his thoughts badly in writing.In addition, graphics reference coloured regions when they are printed in black and white, and the same grpahics are often repeated at irrelevant points throughout the book. Some pictures appear to be from microsoft word art.This is worth gritting your teeth and reading in some ways, but grit your teeth you must."
5,scared the hell out of me,"This book made me think about the goverment. As the evil step brother. Doing sorts of crimes, to use. Make me think how can I stop it NOW! But the worst part is that people don't care. If it don't hurt them now, they don't give a damn.But what's fun is that Nick B. is now coming around, to all consipries out there. So he took things for Mr. Smith's book. And made a new book with things for the this book."
1,HE knows THEM,"Jerry Smith's documentation of the little known secret weapon of the US is amazing! I was skeptical at first, but his evidence is very convincing. I even did some checking up on my own and found out that yes the installation does exist and the gv'mnt's cover storu is jus as he says. Of course, who knows what they've been doing with it lately... populace in a panic or an enemy in fear...bears some thought especially now with the US backing out of armament treaties.if you're looking for a good techie read with lots of pictures, this is your book!"
5,First rate poetry by good dogs,"Why shouldn't a writer help a dog find his voice? Neither cutesy nor cloying, this collection of poems by writers' dogs is pretty great. Gives new meaning to the old-fashioned command, ""Speak!"" Definitely worth reading."
5,Lick my Heart,"Know anyone who is sad, lonely, disgruntled, angry or beyond any human help? Gauranteed relief is in sight if you send this person a copy of UNLEASHED by Amy Hempel and Jim Shephard.. I keep my copy close by and stash an extra copy for emergencies. . And I'm not easily pleased.It's a book of dog poems, poems by writer's dogs. I'm quite partial to the story/poem told by Rick Bass's dog, Homer. Homer , the Alpha dog, is both embarrased by his sister, Anne, and is worried by her habit of peeing when she gets emotional . To his horror, Anne will even take a dump right out in the open where humans walk.Homer says ""I go into the woods and hunker behind a tree. I am modest. I am loyal. We are twins. Children are the only ones who can tell us apart.""As you read, Homer's' "" The Odyssey"" your heart gets bigger and bigger and bigger until you feel it's dangerous to your health to read any farther. For hero-dom, I place him right up beside John Muir's dog, Stickeen."
3,Dogs Don't Write Poetry,"Poets do. Some of them (Andrew Hudgins, Mark Doty) seem to have used their powers of observation to try to understand their dog's psyches a little bit. Others (Rick Bass, Honor Moore) have no clue; they're too busy writing Poetry.As a collection this one is typically uneven, representing the variety of human reaction rather than the steadfastness of Dog.Now, a book of cat poetry. That would be something, no?Right, empty pages...."
5,Best in Teething Relief,My daughter will only use this product. It doesn't have the taste orajell has and it is stickier so it works where you want it to.
5,Works,"This product works, once you get it on their gums. It takes ten seconds and then you can see the relief."
1,Listed incorrectly at 6.4oz - ships .33oz product,The product is fine and have used for my son since he started with teeth. My issue is with the seller claiming this is for a 6.4oz item when they are shipping a .33oz product!
5,A Great Set Up & Reference Guide,I needed this to get a little more out of Mac Mail and It didn't disappoint! It gives you enough detail to really get the most out of the software. We use it for our business.
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Yorick has finally arrived and is a position to look for Beth. However, he runs into a big problem when a journalist from a less than broadsheet quality newspaper finds out he is still alive, and is a story she definitely does not want to lose. He does eventually find Beth, and he certainly gets a hell of a surprise when he sees her."
4,Fun,the whole series is great brain candy. Fun to read and leaves you looking forward to the next one!
1,captain of the very special forces vaughan...,really the guy is the ultimate poseur. avoid at all costs.
3,"Excellent weight distribution, bottles cheaply made","I love the belt itself - it fits tightly and I barely notice it's on me, even on my longer runs (15-20 miles). The front pouch is small, OK for keys but not more than two packs of gel, which is just enough for me.The problem I have are the bottles themselves. I think in the effort to make them flexible and easy to empty, the area where it connects and seals with the cap are porly made and/or the caps themselves aren't the best. I had one cap crack within a few weeks of use, and one that doesn't seal properly between the cap and bottle, making it leak a little.Because of this I use it for easier runs where I have a second source of hydration (ie, water fountains somewhere on my route), but I wouldn't rely on it for long distance runs where I must reply on them 100%.Overall I think the belt itself is one of my favorite items to use, it's only a bit of a shame that the bottles aren't of better quality."
3,Fuel Belts,"Fuel Belts are a great way to carry water or sport drinks on longer runs. The belts never rub or cause wear on your shirts even on the longest, hottest runs (unlike some other water belts that I have used). They're comfortable and easily adjustable.The bottles however do not seal well and can be very difficult to use while actually running. The lack of gaskets within the caps, combined with the soft bottles, mean that you can easily end up squirting sticky sport drinks on yourself while trying to combine running and drinking. I've found that I really need to stop or remove the cap to effectively use the bottles. Finally, they can be somewhat difficult to clean.A good product, and much better than many of the alternatives, but not perfect."
2,Bottles Leak,"As others have indicated, the bottletops leak . . . which is annoying. BUT Fuel Belt has changed their bottle design. I'm not sure if the new bottles are any better, but I recommend that if you buy this product, you make sure you get the new 8oz. bottle style . . . because it can only be an improvement."
3,fuelbelt,"pros: great idea, no bounce, excellent fitcons: very difficult to put caps on bottles so that there's no leak (honestly i can spend 10 minutes doing this!!), diffult---if not impossible-- to put bottle back with one hand b/c the elastic is quite tight (esp if you are using the 10 oz bottles)"
1,"Not practical, too many small bottles","I would only recommend this product to someone if they don't feel comfortable with a water bottle carrier which is centered on their back.The even-distribution of the four bottles is nice, but the bottles are so small you will spend much more time at water stations, screwing and unscrewing tops and pouring water into the small mouths of the bottles. Also, it takes two hands to fit the bottles back in their tight pouches.However, if you are only going to fill these at home and not have to refill them on the run, these problems might not matter.On the plus side, I like the elastic cords which keep the bottles in place and the nozzles are fine to drink from. But after a couple outing I got a 20oz Ultimate Direction water bottle carrier and I never use my fuelbelt."
5,Great Belt,"After reading a number of reviews I decided to get this belt. I have not been disappointed. Although I feel really dorky while sporting it, it has provided me with plenty of water for runs of all distances. I used it to train for and run a marathon in the fall and it was easy to drink from, refill the bottles mid-run and I have had no problem with loose bottles. The pouch fits my iPhone, two keys and I can usually squish a gel pack or two (or a snickers bar!) inside. The tops can be a little leaky after filling them up, but not to the point where they leak while you run. Overall, I have been very pleased with this belt and recommend it."
2,Could be made with better material,"It's nice to have 4 bottles with different fuels for a long run (water, isotonic, C-vitamin, etc), but the elastic that holds the bottles very quickly looses it's pressure, making the fuel belt practically unuseful."
4,Pretty Good,"I wish the velcro wrapped through, like an arm strap. It would make it stay on better. I also wish the sizes weren't so specific. That means, as I lose weight, this will eventually not fit.It works well, and is really easy to grab water, while running. Best to put really cold water in there, as the bottles being close to the body will warm up quick. That would be the same with one of those bottles that you hold in your hand too, though.All in all, when I go running outside this summer, I will be wearing this. There is room for improvement, but it's not a bad price, and it does the job good. I like not having to carry anything and the front pouch is convenient for carrying keys and a couple of bucks."
2,Not the item in the picture!!,"I wanted the item in the picture with the deep nylon pockets to hold the water bottle. This does make the bottles harder to remove while running, but they will not fall out of the pockets. The one I got has plastic pockets which are not as deep like the original. One of the bottles kept falling out when I was running. I had to hold it to complete the run.The one positive...if the bottles would stay in the holder this would be a better design. The bottles are is a better position and is out of the way while running."
3,None,"Good bottle for short runs; if you are looking to go long distance, this bottles will not carry anough water or fluids to hydrate you. Pretty handy and manageble for 1 to 8 miles run. Other than that it is a grat product."
5,Love it!,Comfortable during any run. Although I use this more during my long runs. I wish I purchased on with more bottles. I recommend this for any runner.
5,Sophie brings out the heat and passion in you!!!!,"This is one of Sophie B Hawkins best songs. I have loved this song since it came out in 1994. To this day, I still blast this song in my car and it has the same effect it did over a decade ago when I bought the CD. If you have never heard any of Sophie B Hawkins' music, then you haven't heard one of the most passionate artists out there. Her voice and the sound of her music will put you in a trance. It's too bad she never got the recognition she deserves because she is absolutely brilliant."
4,Burdi Comes Through...,"This CD is a great piece of work. The songs are well producedand very catchy. It is also a very original disc - haven't heard anything quite like it.I heard George Burdi's album, Cult of the Holy War, from the dayswhen he was in the white power movement and must say that I liked it. This is a radical departure from his previous material (more dance, less goth influence) but it is worth while having.My favorite song is Empty Mourning, which is the darkest tune on the album."
3,Hardly any salt on pretzels.,"I like the pretzels, but there is hardly any salt on the pretzels. I've eaten several boxes with the same result. The salt is 90% in the bottom of the bag. I would rate the product a 5 if the salt was on the pretzels. I don't know if is a quality control problem or if some one is shaking the box a LOT. I hope they can fix the problem. I won't buy them again. Other products are better for the salt. The baked pretzels have a special quality to them, but they need the salt for me. Good Luck!"
1,all broken,"I love to use these pretzels to decorate and give to friends and family during the holidays. I just recently bought 3 CASES (36 boxes) all of which contained at least 50% broken pretzels. Each bag only had 3-6 whole pretzels in them. I'm glad that Amazon was able to ""working with me"" on this dilemma but I am still exremely disappointed with the condition in which these were received."
4,Excellent Self Study Guide of Peter's Epistles,This is the first of Irving L. Jensen's books with which I have worked. I have been using the book for my personal study as preparation for leading an adult study group in I and II Peter. The book contains a good balance between teaching and thought provoking questions. The outlines are done very well and help provide a road map to the epistles. One drawback is that the lessons are much too large for one group meeting or personal study time slot.I will definitely consider Mr. Jensen's work for future in-depth Bible studies as he has many other similar guides available.
3,"Not quite a book, more like notes for a book","That someone decided to publish. Maybe all of the ""Dummies"" books are like this. I sat down and read it from cover to cover a couple of times. It wouldn't have taken all that much more work to make it into a finished book.If you buy this book, buy a red marker, too, so you can mark up the book and submit it back to the publisher for corrections... : ' |Overall, the information is solid, though you have to filter through some fluff to get it. The best chapter was one detailing the author's preferred method for setting up a new aquarium. The color photos looked somewhat cheesy, perhaps illustrations would have been a better way to go.Worthwhile, but it really is more like leafing through somebody's rough draft instead of a finished book. If you're going to buy one book, I'd look for another one other than this title."
1,Very incomplete,"I have a B.S. in marine science, and I decided I wanted to bring my work home with me. Someone bought me this book and I read through most of the sections. I was very disappointed. The author doesn't discuss cleaning of the tank in any detail, such as how often you need to clean the gravel, plants and other decorations; they also missed out on describing common problems such as bacterial or algal blooms and what to do. I found some of the information very helpful, but overall, this is far from a complete reference book for the beginner aquarist."
1,"Condescending, inacurate and redundent,","There is some good information buried in this book but it is too hard to get to and has so many inaccuracies that unles you already know something you will be mis-informed. Using the author's calculations in the book my 30"" x 12"" x 18"" (29 gal) tank holds over 4,000 gallons of water and can support 30 plants!The author talks down to the reader in the worst possible ways, with sentences such as ""Actually, there are a lot of other good reasons to keep live plants, but looking cool in front of your friends and family is the most important one."", and by mindless repetition. I'm sorry I spent my money on this one."
2,My first aquarium,I purchased this b/c I had never had an aquarium before. There were a few pieces of info in it I used but most of it I already knew from researching on the internet. Pictures and info seemed somewhat out of date as well.
2,"For beginners, ONLY","If you are an absolute beginner in search of a book that explains the technical stuff in very simple terms and are not concerned with the depth of the information provided, this book is appropriate, except it lacks in the visuals department. If you are looking for depth, you will find none. I was trying to find a good intermediate-level reference...and I'm still looking."
3,Authors suffer at editor's hand,"It's clear the writers know what they are talking about. However the book looks like it never met an editor's eye. There are factual error and redundancies galore, and the organization is, well, disorganized. I also found the juvenile humour very tiresome- but hey- that's true of all the ""For Dummies"" books. I would give the writers a 4+ and the editors a 0, hence, roughly, a generous 3 overall."
5,A Great Movie for all Ages!!!,"This movie is funny and is a great movie to watch with the whole family. This movie is about two parents that are quarreling until a spell is placed on them and they switch bodies. Then, the two parents start to get along while helping each other through one another's chores. This movie teaches on how to get along through the tough times and always have the courage to continue on with what you've started."
1,One of the worst,"As much as I like the Dells, This was one of the worst DVDs I have seen. They were off key and sounded like the curse words they used."
1,DELLS ANT MIGHTY NO MORE,I LOVE THE DELLS BUT THEY CANT SING ANYMORE IN THE 90S THEY COULD BUT NOT NOW THEY NEED TO RETIREA S A P
1,Too late to appreciate,"I have been an avid fan of the Mighty, Mighty Dells for generations!But this DVD provided too much waay too late. It was sad to watch the men I remember as lively and vivid in concert many years ago, and it is a pity that the soul singers I lovingly remember were not captured in their prime. This attempt does them or their leagcy no real justice; it was a shell of their talent. Too bad they could have not maybe told their story amid original renditions of their many hit songs or archived tapes. The memories of the members in their more vibrant youth will remain in my heart and head as strongly as the wonder of the songs and harmonies."
1,Lost their style,Why did I hate the DVD when I love the Dells? Simply because their language was awful. I'm not a prude but there was really no reason for it. Their performance was lacking in itself as though they had stayed passed their prime. They could not hit notes. Overall I was very disappointed and most likely will not attempt to see them live. We threw the DVD out.
2,if you want power look elsewhere,The speakers make a cute accessory if cuteness is what you're looking for. If you want powerful volume then these speakers are not for you. I had to increase the volume in the player and then turn the speakers on their highest level to achieve a big enough sound to fill one room.
1,Think stainless steel,"I bought this fairy bracelet because my niece loves Tinkerbell. I loved the fact that the fairy has a kind of stone on the wings. So I bought one of each, a fairy with red wings, green, blue, well you get the idea. I regret buying them because the actual bracelet feels and looks like stainless steel instead of having a silver look. It reminds me of something that you can buy at a hardware store. Do yourself a favor and pass this one up. Bottom line- cute concept but poorly made."
2,Not so good,This item started losing the gems after two wearings and the charm broke the third time.
5,LONDON SPECTATOR REVIEW,"""The essays gathered in anti-gay represent the earliest onslaught by the new guerrillas and petroleuses of what might be termed the post-gay era, savaging imported american pc pieties, lambasting the sex-and-shopping body-fascism of gay clubland ....in some niftily subversive snips at the barbed wire along the hetero-homo divide. Their leader is the brilliantly buccaneering Mark Simpson whose opening parodic monologue `Gay Dream Believer' satanically debases the coinage of substance abusing disco-chic.' - Jonathan Keates, The Spectator, 1996"
2,Pandering,"If you don't especially like modern gay culture and want a club to beat it down with, this is your book. I also like gay culture, so I was much less favorably inclined. On the whole, the book is humorless and fairly boring; the authors never really wrap their minds around the full implications of gay culture for modernity. The essays vary in quality, but most of them are competent. Only on occasion are they genuinely thought-provoking. Actually, a few of the ""reviews"" from other reviewers strike me as better critiques than anything in this book. As for the view that we are entering a ""post-gay"" age, that's pretty much whistling in the dark."
2,"Anti-Gay, Anti-Schmay","I was excited about what this book had proposed, a big slap in the face of the moribund state of Gay Culture (coming soon to a circuit party near you!) However, tiresome political essays and bland essays make this book sound more like a rambling bitch fest. They (the various authors spotlight a lot problems with the so-called gay community but don't offer much to put in it's place.For a book that attempts to smack the politically correct around the head and neck, it retains it own precarious sense of political correctness."
4,A book for the 21st Century,"Finally, I book to take on the ""Gay Orthodoxy"" of the 70' and 80' and the nihilism of the 90's.I am not surprised that our self styled ""Gay leaders"" are offended."
1,sound like plastic bags,really - with a name like simmons I thought it would be a good purchase - you sweat alot because its a layer of plastic - sounds like you are sleeping on garbage bags - i got a nicer one at target - plush cover without the NOISE
2,These Matress pads create to much Heat,I order 2 twin size mattress pads and 1 full size pad becuase my children are at the stage of having accidents. When i purchased the products i recieved them within a timely matter but now no longer use them. They create to much heat instead of my children having an accident they would wake up in a pool of sweat. I dont feel there is enough padding on it to prevent the plastic underlay from sticking to the person sleeping in the bed. So I am still in search of finding the right mattress pads.
5,It keeps the mattress dry!,"Time and time again, it keeps working great. With 3 kids 5 and under, and numerous washings, it's still keeping the mattress dry."
2,who is this for?!,"If you're a kettlebell beginner, this is NOT for you. It says as much on the DVD case.If you're experienced with kettlebells, you won't learn anything new - her form on swings isn't great, and even youtube has much more and better kettlebell content than this does. Most of it isn't even a kettlebell workout (!!) - it's just aerobics.I don't know who (what fitness background or goals) would use this. It's just a bunch of exercises thrown together, with minimal use of light kettlebells.""Kettlebell"" in the title is really misadvertising. I'm skeptical of the glowing reviews."
2,Not for me,"I have read the Bento has a lot of fans, but it was not for me. I like hardcore moves that flo. I didn't really feel the energy in her workouts. I am very advanced, runner, triathlete and love Hiit training. I wont be buying anymore Bento DVD's"
2,Disappointed.,"Pretty disappointing. The reviews suggested the work out would be difficult and the DVD is described as advanced, but when you factor in the warm up, stretching, and cool down - you are really only exercising for 12 or 13 minutes. Additionally, Amy uses different kettlebell weights and sometimes 2 for certain workouts. If dont have a library of kettlebells to work with, you have to improvise."
3,fun workout but needs better editing,"I have enjoyed doing these short workouts....I have several other DVD's which I rotate often but this is one of my favorites when I am short on time....However, the editing is not very professional...On 2 of the 3 options, Amy tells you ahead of time what is coming up during the 30 second cool down then abruptly changes to another exercise. There are some repeated exercises on the workouts...I would have liked all 3 options to be completely different."
4,A DMHO Christmas,"I really enjoy Denver and the Mile High Orchestra's Christmas CD. Most of it is very lively and the horn section is reminiscent of the band Chicago from the 70's and 80's. A couple of songs go a little too long, losing some of their effect. Overall, this is a group of amazing musicians and a singer that would have fit in well in the big band era of music history. If seasonal music is not your thing, check out their other music, including their CD for children. Amazing!"
1,Never received the product,"I ordered this book in plenty of time to get it for Christmas (more than 2 weeks). It did not come and I received no updates until AFTER Christmas at which point I was told sorry for the delay it would arrive shortly. A few days later I received a note processing a credit because the book was out of stock. If I would have known it was out of stock when I ordered it, I could have gotten it somewhere else."
1,safe as rain water,"I believe it is safe as rain water. The only problem is that is all the more cleaning power it had. I used it as a prespray for a stem cleaning application and was totally disappointed. The spots I had before were still there, it may have removed about 10% of the the spot and I believe that is being generous. I cleaned other carpets with a product called ""Awesome"" that is for steam cleaning carpets that costs $6.30 a gallon with a lot greater success."
2,UGH,"It was cheap, so I wasn't bothered by how flimsy it is, but I've owned it less than a week and it's already rusty."
1,Dented pan,"Recieved pan with a dent in the side; was going to return same, but postage will cost too much. Sincerely, RGB."
2,MITER PROBLEM,"The miter was off on the postive stop settings. 0 degrees was offabout 3/4 of a degree. There is no way, that I could determine,how to correct this problem. So I had to send it back. Apparentlythis is not an isolated issue. In the owner's manual was an insertthat states if this happens with the digital readout model, thenreset the miter read out. Of course the positive stops still exitswith the incorrect settings so I don't know what you are suppose todo. I guess the positive stops become not usable."
3,Hitachi Parts Support,"I purchased my C10FCH about a year ago from Lowe's. Out of the box it has been great, though I give it pretty light jobs. I overstressed the vise assembly arm (pot metal) and broke it. I don't blame Hitachi for this, but getting any help to purchase a replacement part is impossible. The C10FCH is made for the US/Canadian market. The manual list no parts dealers/phone numbers or e-mail addresses. Calls and e-mails to Hitachi USA found on Google seem to be quickly discarded. So, keep it working the best you can--there will be no back-up from Hitachi to fix something for you. Charles Beattie"
4,Good tool,"Nice saw. Reliable stops, good laser, accurate cuts, solidly built. Instruction manual needs work. Otherwise a pleasure to use."
1,Bevel angle scale fell off,"The very first time I made miter cut with my new Hitachi C10FCH compound saw, the bevel angle scale fell on the floor. When cutting molding, the blade will mare the edge of the cut before cutting the wood.I'm very sorry I purchased the saw. Plan on returning it for a Delta."
2,"Like the birdies sing, cheap, cheap cheap, cheap cheap.","A DIY'er may like this saw to build a dog house or fence, as $149 is not going to get you much more saw than this. For a few dollars more, not even a fist full of dollars, you can get much better.Why do they make a place to keep the wench and hex-key they give you and then tell you to always be sure to remove them from the holder before using the saw? Is it because they may come in contact with the blade?Why is the lazar on the one I HAD so hard to adjust that I never did move it in fear that it would break? Is it because you can still use the saw without the lazar that is going to break someday anyway?The saw I HAD came pre-set to build Toontown. All the angles were off just enough for Goofy and Daffy Duck to do just fine with it.I have Hitachi's hand-held circular saw and it works OK. Their nailers are tops. Perhaps I would be pleased with their 12"" miter saw, but I replaced this one with a DeWALT."
4,GREAT SAW!!!!,"This product lives up to its hype the laser can be distracting at times ,I leave it off , other than that its ease of use for the experienced, is second to none for the DIY'ers please make practice cuts you want cuss as often"
2,AMAZON SENT THIS ITEM DAMAGED,I bought this item as a gift and right out of the box it had a busted handle. After contacting them they told me to contact the manufacturer and order a new part. I BOUGHT IT NEW AND I ALREADY HAVE TO BUY SOMETHING TO FIX IT!!!! AMAZON SHOULD REPLACE THE BROKEN PART!! I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND BUYING AN ITEM OF THIS SIZE AND VALUE FROM A HOME IMPROVEMENT STORE WHERE THEY STAND BY WHAT THEY SELL AND GIVE YOU WHAT YOU PAY FOR. A NON DAMAGED ITEM!!!!!!!!!
5,Better than Print Shop 22,"This works well with XP I know. I do NOT think it will work with Vista. For Vista you will need #18 or so. When I bought a new computer with Vista, I had to scrap this program and purchase 18. THEN I found how HORRIBLE Vista was at NOT being able to use MOST of the older programs ALL MY FILES ARE IN. I finally GAVE AWAY my Vista and purchased a refurbished office computer with XP - Pro. - - and now, all is right with the world.Broderbund needs to take note about COMPATIBILITY. They seem to just want to SELL NEW PRODUCTS."
1,Didn't work!!,"This computer program didn't work. I bought it used, but still... I was very disappointed. I recommend buying a new one. I wasted my money."
4,Emergency,I tend 2 like all things jamiroquai but this 1 started it all and it really deserves a listen. Very ahead of it's time.
3,Dance with dignity,"3 1/2Perhaps a little too sleekly funked up for its own good, this exciting debut of deserving dance music was still an inspired platform for the jazzy popsters to enter the arena."
5,Yes,"This jamiroquai album is probably their best. I own all of their CD's and this one has more funk, jive and groove. Perfect to drive, work, or dance to."
4,Excellent,Jay Kay never lets you down. Yet more funky tunes. It's one more to add to anyone's collection. I still put Travelling Without Moving top of my list here though.
4,A new style is born with this album...,"Jamiroquai's first release with Sony S2 makes an important rebirth of Funk music. It's really difficult to find a band in our days with that exceptionnaly well fusioned Acid Jazz - Funk - Pop style as Jamiroquai. Since Stevie Wonder no music band could ever reach that level of musical quality in what respects funk. The tracklist offers us a great variety of different sounds, coming from When you gonna learn and Too Young to die both famous and revolutionary money making singles to intrumental (latin-jazz style) Music of the mind. Jamiroquai finds the key for 70's rebirth true a bass, a guitar, the drums, a trumpet, some keyboards and a didgeridoo.My favorite tunes: When you gonna learn, Too Young to die, If I like it I do it, Music of the Mind and Revolution 1993."
3,"buy ""travelling without moving"" or ""space cowboy"" instead","Ok, their first album. It's very funky and acid jazzy, less commercial in every way. Good for hardcore Jamiroquai fans, but if you only joined the parade with the most recent albums, I wouldn't recommend it. Much less dancy, much less mainstream, much less sing-along-able."
1,Bland and Dated,"Jamiroquai`s debut was a critically aclaimed record when it came out in the early nineties, yet I fail to understand why. This is hardly innovative and original stuff, just a rehash of some sounds from the seventies with a couple of more contemporany and recent production details. ""Emergency on Planet Earth"" mixes funk, lounge, soul, pop and even a bit of jazz, trying to sound fresh, hip and subtle yet it ends up being unmemorable, slow and tiresome for the most part. The first songs are somewhat promising, but as the record unfolds it only gets boring and drags for way too long, becoming useless elevator music. Ok, so the environmental message ""love mother nature"" is mildly interesting, still that doesn`t make this effort any better.Overall weak."
5,OUTTA SIGHT!,"Jamiroquai beautifully combines so many influences in all their music, and this, their first album, is probably where these influences are most raw. Every song on this CD is AWESOME! If you are a Jamiroquai fan then you MUST buy this album! It will blow your mind!"
5,More greatness.,"More great funk/electonica music by the modern day funk masters. Great beats, rhythms, and marvelous bass lines. Keep the soul alive guys!"
3,Interesting background material; unbelievable heroine,"As with most of the Matteson's I've read so far, this one is well-researched, and presents some interesting background info (I'm convinced Matteson must be the nom de plume of an academic of some kind). Problems remain with our dauntless heroine, Charlotte. Why must she be so perfect? The author takes shots at all of the other characters (especially other women) but her heroine is so perfect (five academy awards--give me a break!!) she's awful. Loosen up Matteson! Silk Road is perhaps her best attempt yet."
5,This book presented a fascinating history of China.,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I learned a lot of interesting facts pertaining to China. The plot kept me guessing all the way through the book, too.I was not able to guess ""who dun it"" at any point. The characters were unusual and memorable. I particularly liked Charlotte. She is a sleuth of first calaber. I highly recommend this book to mystery fans. I will read more by this author"
4,Amusing,"For those of you who are conspiracy theory people, this movie makes credible sense.The way politics and media are today, this certainly puts a spin on things. Although a little slow dare I say boring, Robert DeNiro and Dustin Hoffman do a great job of keeping it interesting and credible. It's fun and amusing."
5,"Fun, smart movie","This is a great movie, with enough intelligence and star power to keep even the most politically apathetic date entertained throughout. Highly recommended."
5,Wag the Dog,I loved it. If you like black comedy this is the film for you. I rate it all the way up there with Dr. Strangelove and The Hospital.
3,Media,"Wag the Dog is an honest portrayal of how the media ""fixes"" situations for the public to see. The cast is believable. What viewers should take away from this movie is the fact you cannot believe anything the media/news provides us. It is what they want us to see and know, not what is the truth. I love that Amazon has a library of the older movies."
2,Characters are unaffected by events.,"Dustin Hoffman is Harry Thomassonesque, & DeNiro is a hybrid of Ed Rollins & Dick Morris in this political media satire ripped (incredibly) from pending headlines. Let's watch how media personnel manipulate events. The characters manipulate each other too, but no one seems adversely or otherwise affected; they go out (in one way or another) as they came in: gregarious, self-aggrandizing, and analgesic. This video lost me when the three main characters survive a jet plane crash & look no worse for wear than if they'd just attended a 3-hour management seminar. I never watched ""Cheers,"" but I'm convinced that Woody Harrelson is becoming one of the premier character actors of our time: his brief but brilliant Sgt. Schumann role stands out from the generally undisturbed dullness. This video did convince me too how genuinely dull but desperate the real manipulators of world events must be. D+"
3,It was a good movie but not the best i've ever seen.,Dustin Hoffman gave a powerful performance as a President who wanted to cover up a horrendous sex scandal by making a war.
4,Lighten Up,"Without being too analizing of every detail of the movie (of which, I had a problem with the plane crash and it had too much chatter, not enough action), I thought this story's overall point is clear. Of course it is going to be off on certain details.. they filmed it in 29 days! But to think that it is completely far-fetched is naive."
3,"Interesting, but not enthralling","As a satire, this movie does very well. Especially if you don't like Clinton or politicians in general. However, I never found myself completely hooked in to the whole idea just because it seemed so absurd. In fact, the movie bored me at times. The acting was slightly above average, but nothing spectacular. It makes a good movie if you are in the mood for political satire or just enjoy the political genre in general."
4,"If you love the war circus, you won't like this movie","There is a lot of people who love live transmissions of bombings and refugees, and they have turned war into a very good business for the media. Of course, they won't like this movie as it treats them like stupids.But if you think war (and politics) became a real circus, you'll enjoy this movie. It's so satiric!By the way, the spanish subtitles do not translate everything."
3,YAWN!,"What was the point? Who cares? Yes yes yes, by now we all know that ""truth is stranger than fiction"" that lots of ""dirty politics exist"". Why bore us with it? Dustin and Robert must have made a lot of money for this one, they certainly didn't do it for the great screenplay. Worth watching if you have nothing better to do. Did I mention: ""WHO CARES""???"
1,"The can be written for a Democrat, or Republican","For that matter it can be written for any party candidate that wants the truth of his/her dirty secrets covered up. I feel that it's the most insulting film to be released. It hides the fact that we as citizens, and our government don't really care about who we stick in office. If the party lines up with what we believe in screw the fact he had to cover something up. I can't fathom why we continue to fall for this all the time, and believe me I don't feel it's right to air it all over the news either. I feel that it comes down to the man, and if he does have the values his/her party believes in then he will do the honorable thing, and own up to his/her mistake. This movie is just another nail to drive into the justification that it's alright to cover things up, and there are no absolutes, or rights or wrongs. Wht happens when we tick off the wrong person who's rich? Do we wait until then to change the moral? That's Pathetic, and so is this movie."
1,Wag the Dog,"This movie has got to be the worst script ever written. If it even had a script. It must have been conceived during a dream of a left-winger. It is a conspiracy fantasy of how the White House must be for those who have no idea of how to cope with real world.In the end, the movie has two great actors, Dustin Hoffman and Roberth DeNiro wasting their breath."
4,Wag the dog,"The director of hte movie""Wag the dog"" is Barry Levinson. Most important two cats are Robert de Niro and Dustin Hoffman. The movie is from 1997 and it is made in USA. It is about the election campaign in the USA. It shows you how and whata President do who has got a sexual affaire with a little school- girl.I think this movie is for all voters in the world but specially for voters in the USA. The reason is that most of politician do not say allways the true.In my opinion the movie isvery realistic. The last elections in the USA prove that alltoughBush makes very bad things he won the elections, like in the film."
5,superb,""" Barry Levinson's comedy... "" comedy? satire maybe. while certainly funny at times,the movie could almost be scary if one were to casually embrace (or discard)the idea that we can be that easily manipulated.a previous reviewer suggested the ending was ""weak"". my first impression. however,the outcome that seemed so predictable,was presented only by the crackling radio voice of the very same media that facilitated all the previous manipulations.superb. also:interesting allusions to john wayne's The Green Berets (not even counting the ""men of the 303"")"
1,I could not buy the premise of this film.,"Everybody seems to like this movie, but for me it seemed such a far-fetched premise that I couldn't buy into it. How is it possible for one Hollywood producer with a short strip of film covering one scene able to fool the entire news media industry? How is it possible that no other news organization would not send a reporter to verify a war? How is it possible that no one would have a pang of conscience about misleading the public to hide molestation? Dustin Hoffman jumped around in this role like he was trying very hard to believe this premise but couldn't really bring himself to do it. I had to shut it off after forty minutes, it seemed so contrived."
2,Totally improbable. Leave your brain on the shelf.,"Ripped from today's headlines! Timely yet timeless! A great story with great performances! Ooops, that's what I WISH I could say about this movie. Yes, there are very good performances from all the stars (although Dustin Hoffman is his usual annoying self). However, the basic premise of the move is SO unbelievable, that I wanted to turn off the VCR (I didn't, because I needed to see how ridiculous it could get), and tune in a grizzly news story about real war atrocities. Do yourself a favor and watch this to see how a bad concept can waste millions of dollars."
5,A Very Wicked And Prophetic Satire,"When this movie came out, Monica Lewinski's 15 minutes of fame (or infamy) had not started ticking, though people thought it was realistic especially with Clinton in the White House. A year later, Clinton was bombing Iraq, which coincidentally coincided with when the impeachment hearings took place (starting the day the hearings were to begin, though they were postponed a day, and ending right after the hearings ended, being termed a success).The makers of the movie for some reason thought this movie needed an R rating and used the ""f"" word more than necessary (though I feel it being used once is much more than necessary). Aside from that, the movie was funny (e.g. a girl running with Doritos), with cynicism concerning the reporting of news. By the way, this movie was not a direct attack on Clinton but rather looking at the way politicians work.Dustin Hoffman earned his best actor nomination. Robert DeNiro deserved one as well."
2,Better on the small screen than the big screen.,"I would have given this film 3 stars if it wasn't for De Niro's chracter. Robert De Niro is a great actor, but his character could have been better. Also, this film was too fast and unrealistic. De Niro's character sounds like a mental retard because he talks so fast (no offense to Robby, as I said, he's great). What makes this film satisfying is Hoffman's character, and the great one-liner ""this is nothing!"". You have to see this film just because of Dustin."
2,"Great Trailer, Average Movie","I was looking forward to seeing this movie that features two of my favorite actors, Dustin Hoffman and Robert Dinero. The theatrical trailer was funny and hooked me into buying the movie without any of my own research. As I watched the film I kept hoping for it to get more interesting or more funny, neither materialized. I would not recommend buying this movie. It would in my opinion be a good rental or HBO film not one to add to your collection, but it does have a great trailer...."
5,Political satire...,"...at its pinnacle. It is sooo funny, and in many ways, so true as well. The performers seem to enjoy themselves immensely, and the soundtrack is also brilliant, lending the perfect touch to a very clever script.If you have been bit by the political bug, and still managed to keep your sense of humor, you will likely enjoy this movie quite a bit."
2,Glad We Didn't See it at the Theatre,"My wife and I never got around to seeing this movie at the theatre, even though we wanted to do so. Good thing. Finally, we rented it and were pretty disappointed. It was a good idea, but the movie seemed like a bunch of clever lines loosely wrapped into a disjointed roll of celluloid. And while I know much of the Washington political scene doesn't make sense, a lot of this movie made no logistical sense; i.e., surviving a plane crash, Woody Harrelson's background going undetected by the nosy media, etc. Perhaps the movie was just a vehicle to put Hoffman and DeNiro (or DeNiro and Hoffman) together. All in all, a letdown."
5,"Good Old Shoe as ""Jessica Lynch""?","Very Intersting Movie.When I heard the news that Jessica Lynch,Rescued POW in the ""Operation Iraqi Freedom"", has Amnesia,the news reminds me of this movie.May be,may be .....her episode was a kind of ""Good old shoe""one(""Good Old Shoe"" is a character in ""Wag the dog"" who is a MIA rescued in Alabania.But his rescue was setup by a Spindoctor hired by White House ).And ,Who is Dustin Hoffman,a Producer and De Niro,a Spindoctor in this iraq war?so, this is a very very inersting movie,even today."
3,Wag the dog,"The name of the film is ""wag the dog"" and it was made in 1997. The director of the film is Barry Levinson.The main casts are Robert De Niro as Conrad Brean, Anna Hechs as Winifred Ames and Dustin Hoffman as Stanley Motss.I think the film is a mix of a comedy and a political satire.The plot is about a election in the USA. It comes out that the president has a affaire with a young student. So now his assistants Miss Ames, Mr Brean and the producer Stanley Motss try with crimal and faked movies to influence and convince the people to vote for the old president.It really shows how influenceable people and also the media are.The movie is at all funny but sometimes also boring.I think the movie is for people wo are interested in politics and like to see how much the media and people are influenceable and how succsesful the lies are."
3,LIGHTEN UP,"Of course, this is a spoof! This is like a 90-minute episode of The Simpsons or South Park. If you doubt it, simply refer to the increasingly absurd developments that take place in the second half of the film. WAG THE DOG lacks the sophistication of the 1964 satire, DR. STRANGELOVE (which, after all, was presented to a more literate, pre-Flower Power, necktie-wearing public, rather than to the post-MTV, DVD generation), but WAG is not bad for a one-time viewing. There is plenty of excellent photography in here; and pretty good editing, too. Good slapstick. There's NO way the film-makers were taking this production too seriously. Get yourself into cartoon-and-snack mode and enjoy this gag. As for the reviewers who believe the secret to how the world really works is exposed in this film I can only say: get a clue. If anything, this is how Hollywood works to create and market a film, and this aspect was at least as interesting as the thin plotline."
1,I wish I could have left,I could not get up and go home. I wanted very much to walk out.I read that the movie was done in a very short period of time. It showed in the quality of the dialogue and overall content. I believe the movie would have been a complete flop without the Clinton/Lewinsky situation. I enjoy satire. I didn't find humor and satire in the dialogue as much as another attempt to exploit the Clinton and Lewinsky situation.
4,Not your dollar t-shirts,"Great quality t-shirts as expected from Champion. as it says implies by the title, they are not cheap in price either. Not much more to say."
3,moderate,This is a fine shirt though not enough for heavy duty so if you jog a lot and sweat a lot that might be an issue...
4,Worked fine,I bought this for a work trip to Costa Rica and it worked fine. I only wish that I could find it.
3,its thin,"Its nice for a workout, but my chest hairs poke through for the world to see. Also it wrinkles pretty easily."
3,so big,"I thought this cd was not bad, there are some great songs to use with your own kids, but I teach a mommy and me class, and I found this a little too repetitive and slow. Nice for really young ones."
4,So fun and my daughter loves it,"My daycare provider turned me onto this cd. The reviews of Hap Palmer are all great and with good reason. My daughter loves this cd and its very easy on the ""parent"" ears. I often find myself humming or singing these songs when I'm away from her. Very catchy and fun."
1,never got it...,"I would love to review this product, it is cute and I wanted it special for my brother-in-law for Christmas (we are all dachsie lovers). But after repeated attempts to get the product delivered, never got it. Customer service is lousy for this company, they lie, and believe me won't ever get my or anybody in my family's business again. And also believe me on this, I am passing the word Computer Brain. Get your act together."
2,Dated and spotty,"Written from a largely European (British) perspective, the book is dated in its discussion of equipment and usage. While its discussion of wave propagation and other technical matters is interesting and well presented, the book lacks a ""meat and potatoes"" approach to actual radio usage. Although etiquette is covered, there is practically no discussion of how to monitor and initiate calls, no presentation of frequency applications nor details of weatherfax and e-mail. The book is simply not a good source for one desiring to know how to operate a marine SSB to one's advantage."
3,If only the phantom would stop reappearing!,"Just thought you'd like to know I've got Ted Berrigan's copy, and he (or somebody!) has ticked two of the poems. Its reputation for unreadability, up there with Browning's Sordello (if you didn't think Dante Gabriel Rossetti had a sense of humour, read his masterful quip!), is probably undeserved - in view of What Came After, it's not as bad as it seems. Sordello, however, is still unreadable"
4,A terrific momento of a magical place.,"This slender but well illustrated book features the magnificant homes built in the early part of the twentieth century by the wealthy residents of Long Island's North Shore. It is an excellent momento if you have been visiting Long Island. For a person, like me, who grew up on Long Island and drove past these estates daily, it is a wonderful chance to see behind the big walls and know more about the families who built them"
4,A good series.,"I would have given it five stars if it hadn't been edited for the US and I am quite angry that the company refuses to tell us that. Also, I would have given it less stars if I was able to find a place that sells Japanese imports of this series."
4,Troubled teen meets sentient mecha..,"A twist on the old 'giant robot' genre, Evangelion's main character, Shinji, is quiet, shy, brooding, and absolutely nothing like the usual spunky heroes that hop in their machines and run off to face certain doom. This series is incredible, and I'm not a huge fan of mecha series. It gets very cerebral at times, and somewhat disturbing at others."
5,"GAINAX rules, and Evangelion proves it again!","I honestly wasn't expecting a lot from Evangelion, because I usually don't like overhyped series, but holy hydraulics! I haven't seen this type of plot and character development since Wings of Oneamis -- you care what happens to these people. Gainax's story and character designs are, as usual, a brilliant font of consistency that have made this title stand out among its peers like no other (at least the subtitled version does - I haven't seen the dub). The combination of sci-fi and philosophy would do authors like Bob Heinlein proud. Gainax is the best anime studio out there, and I'm glad to see they're eager to show us why. Oh, and anyone that thinks Gainax's clean, powerful animation style is ...less than average... is probably one of the clique that watches Akira to see people's heads explode. Bottom line: If you like good anime, and care about what you watch, Neon Genesis Evangelion will not disappoint you."
3,Evangelion was Dissapointing,"I hate being the only bad review, but I found that for all the hype and 'controversy' about this series, I really didn't enjoy the first video. I give it three stars, but I would rate it at 50%, because I found the drawings were extremely good. But, upon thinking it would be more serious, I found out it had a tendency to be Sailor-Moonish (unless the dubbing was just really bad). I'msure the story gets better later on, but this first volume will not entice me to get future ones. If anybody can e-mail me and maybe persuade me that the other volumes aren't as immature or have better story, than I may continue... but, until then, I can only rate what I feel of this series.P.S. What is that ""unfamiliar ceiling"" all about?"
5,AMAZING,"It is simply amazing, I can't even begin to explain.The video is just a few clicks away what are you waiting for!"
1,Most Over-Hyped Piece of Garbage since Blair Witch Project,"The characters are redundant, the mecha designs are trash-compared to Shoji Kawamori's mecha, and the religious references are tossed around as easily as pop culture. The characters are also sado-masochistic, and thrive on making life worse for one another. The story is just the same fight after fight with Angels. The only bit of originality is in the obscure references that would otherwise make this as unoriginal as the next giant robot show. Move on."
5,The best anime series in the world!,"This is the best. The plot is excelent . The charactors are great. And the animation is the best. If you like this series get the N64 import from www.Gamecave.com for about $75 . Get it now. Parental Warnings: Sutible for most kids . Contains : Very mild profanity, some religous themes, extreamly brief nudity, and violence."
5,"In a word, brilliant.","I cannot reccomend this series enough. Brilliantly directed, it is as thought-provoking and awe-inspiring as it is exiting and just plain fun to watch. As the series progresses, its characters become so real that you feel that you know them. The animation is the best I've seen, having the ability to be both stark and spectacular. Lastly, Eva's story bravely chalanges our notions of faith and human nature as it flings you headlong into a malestorm of terror and courage, abject evil and sacrifice. As a whole, the series leaves you breathless."
4,Great first video for a great series,"after watching this all i can say is wow what a masterpiece of anime these first two episodes really help to establish what occurs in later episodes a lot is left unsaid that is clarified in the later episodes, such as why ikari who rei is and whats up with the evangelions eye but this movie is superb definitely a buy if you dig mecha or sci/fi the rest of the series is worth investing in because this first episode lacks only in action shots but when theyre there they rock and the series' plot and depth and action only increses with each in short buy the video"
3,Wonderful artwork but hard explanation,"Evangelion was a wonderful series with beautifuly drawn anime charecters,but they have trouble with one minore detail-EXPLAINING. As you watch the first video your only having fun with the artwork ,comedy, and Sci-fi. You never relise how lost you are until the 6th tape. They take a little to long to explain certain parts and they have also left out things they should've answered. Besides that,I loved the series and if your old enough to understant it,I'd rent it immiediatly!!!!!Rei Ayanami~ Alot of people are saying in thier reviews that they don't like Rei's charecter because she rarely speaks. I got to tell you ahead of time that there is a reason for this and later she does show more emotion and social ability. Keep that in mind.THats all I have to say!"
5,An amazing Sci-Fi Anime,"This volume contains the first two episodes of Neon Genesis Evangelion, one of the most controversial animes around. The animation is great and the dubbing is very well done, staying true to the original Japanese script. The story takes place in the year 2015, in which alien monsters called ""Angels"" are attacking Tokyo-3. The humans enlist a small number of teenagers (hey, it's anime)to pilot large robots to defeat these Angels. That's where our unlikely and reluctant hero, Shinji, comes in, being summoned to Tokyo-3 to become a pilot. A shocking story unfolds through the series filled with action, drama, and stunning science fiction. These first episodes are great; they introduce the characters, who are pretty believable, and the battles yet to come. A must-see for all anime fans!"
2,Good tv bad build quality,This is my second TV that I have got. The first one had creaking sounds coming from inside the moment you start the TV. The second one has the same problem too. The sharp customer service sucks big time.The picture quality is good. The set up is easy too.
4,Very good TV with one annoying fact,"The TV was offered at a great price by Amazon, and was promptly delivered as well. It provides a beautiful picture, especially with anything that can output a high definition signal.The one annoying problem is that it makes a crackling sound as it continues to warm up. I've tried moving it around the TV stand to see if it needs better ventilation, but that does not appear to be the problem.So, one of the internal components makes this crackling noise for the first few minutes as the TV warms up when you turn it on.It is a beautiful black on black TV, and the picture is great. I also own a 26 inch Aquous, but that one does not have this 'popping' sound when you first turn it on."
4,Plastic Panic!,"Jason Melby, in his debut thriller, DRASTIC MEASURES, has written a winner! Fast, furious, fateful & occasionally oddly funny & poignant, with only a few flaws.DRASTIC MEASURES, set in Washington DC, is a gripping tale of money mismanagement, innocence, entitlement & get quick rich schemes, actions & reactions, friends in dark trouble & enemies in all the obvious places, truth & consequences. Hurtles you along like a Hummer without brakes.Could not put it down!"
3,"Don't get the ""Longer Version!""","I have loved this musical since I was a kid, and I was so excited to get it on dvd that I didn't pay much attention to the bottom where it said ""New Longer Version."" Like most of the movies they've released like this way recently, this one was much better in the original cut. I know exactly what scenes were added back, and I have to say that it's obvious why they were cut in the first place. This wouldn't be so bad if it had the option to watch the uncut version, but it doesn't. If you don't think it'll make that much difference, know that I will be buying it again in the original cut. I can't even stand to watch the new dvd - I watch my old vhs despite the lower quality picture. The overall movie is just that much better without those clips.Please, do buy this movie if you like musicals (you'll love it!), but for goodness sake, get the original cut! (144 min. not 172 min.)[...]"
2,Easily an hour too long,"I wanted to enjoy this, as I remember liking the song ""Fortuosity"" on a Disney compilation LP I had as a child. However, seeing the movie itself for the first time as an adult, the movie is fairly tedious, with little of great interest going on. (I didn't even like ""Fortuosity"" as much as I remember.) It could have been trimmed by a full hour without losing much -- in fact, maybe it would have had more punch. As for the acting, I did enjoy Leslie Ann Warren, John Davidson, and Fred MacMurray, but Tommy Steele's mugging was pretty grating after a while.Surprisingly, my sons, ages 6 and 8, seemed to enjoy it more than I did, even though it didn't contain any of the magic of, say, ""Mary Poppins."" So maybe you just need to see it for the first time when you're young..."
5,the lesson: It's ok to be yourself.,"This is a lovely movie, a little silly, especially imagining Leslie Ann Warren, previously an actress who played Cinderella on tv, who is now supposed to be a skilled boxer, but its really a great movie. It teaches you that no matter what people think of you, you must stand up to them, you must ""fight"" for your position. Those in the upper classes often get locked into the idea that they must act high class and refined. The happiest millionaire defies that wonderfully. this movie, the first time I saw it, so excited me I couldn't sleep the whole night. Don't watch it before bedtime!"
4,"A BIT under-rated, but NOT a great movie...","How can Walt Disney top ""Mary Poppins?"" He can't. But that didn't stop him from trying. ""The Happiest Millionaire"" is the first of many tries--and it's easy to understand why it flopped miserably in it's original release. Thankfully with this release, the film can be seen and judged on its own merits. Silly but very likable songs, and great performances all the way around help the TRIFLE of a story work it's way towards a typical Disney ending. Compared with other bloated musicals of the same period (""My Fair Lady,"" Paint Your Wagon,"" and ""Camelot""), it holds up pretty well. And like the other films, it hasn't dated very well, unlike the completely TIMEless ""Mary Poppins."""
4,Fun for the whole family,The kids love this movie and all of the other moves that Disney had Fred McMurray stand in. It's a great family movie.
5,Wonderful Family Film,"This film has been MY favorite since third grade (I'm 27). It is wonderfully fun and uplifting with Great singing and dancing. In a world where cartoons can scare kids, my three-year-old loves this film. It may be long, but with all the songs, it makes for a fast watch. Also the story is simple enough that children can turn it off one day and watch more the next."
3,The Roadshow Edition...not anamorphic widescreen,"This film is not one of Disney's best, but if, like my wife, you were raised on musicals, it will not disappoint.What did disappoint was Disney's failure to enhance the Roadshow Edition for 16 x 9 televisions. I recently bought my first HDTV, and in going through my DVD collection to determine which discs were enhanced, this was one of the few issued since 2000 which was not. A bit odd, but buyer beware."
5,Love it!!!,"I am a very huge fan of the movie. I recently moved from San Diego, California, and I was always able to get all Disney shows there. I have ""The Happiest Millionaire"" on VHS, and I cannot get anough of it. I have been in Washington State now for a little over two months. Maybe it is because I am homesick, but I am craving for this right now. I found ""The One and Only Genuine Original Family Band"" a few days ago, but when I found out I could have both of my two ultimate favorites together, at one time, I had to order. My Dad will get the open copy of my movie, and I will get the unopened (which is how it will stay until I cannot resist anymore)!!! Love John Davis and Lesley Ann Warren together. It is so much the match made in heaven. Anyone like her in ""Clue""?..."
3,my youngest likes it,"It's a sweet movie, and it was entertaining enough the first time, but I'll probably never watch it all the way through again. My youngest daughter liked it quite a bit when she was 4-7, and it became part of the regular rotation of comfort films. The music is good, the values are very family oriented, and it's very wholesome.I got curious about the family on which this movie was based, and I couldn't learn much, but there was such a family, and they are apparently still around and still very rich and connected. One thing I learned is that the person on whom the John Davidson character is based died shortly after marrying the Biddle daughter, although he did leave at least one son. I can't remember much about what I discovered (it's been several years since I looked them up), but I got the distinct feeling that a factual movie about the family would have been quite interesting, and that this might be why they were picked as the subject of this one."
1,Shorter version please! Editors exist for a reason!,"Wow. This longer version of the movie I grew up with pretty much ruins the show for me. YUCK.I'll have to go back and see how to get the old version, which is fun and funny and moves along at a great clip."
3,Good fun,"""The Happiest Millionaire"" was Walt Disney's follow-up to his classic""Mary Poppins"".While the movie is not on that level,it is a lively,entertaining musical comedy that's much better than it's given credit for.And it's certainly more fun than some other late '60smusicals like ""Camelot"",""Star!"",and ""Sweet Charity"".It has a lavishproduction,an amusing A.J.Carothers script,a spirited cast,and a lovely Sherman brothers score.The best songs are the lovely ""It Won't Be Long'Till Christmas"" and ""Are We Dancing?"".Fred MacMurray,Greer Garson,LesleyAnn Warren,and Geraldine Page are very good.John Davidson is OK.But it'sTommy Steele and Gladys Cooper who steal the show.All in all,this is anenjoyable film that provides the audience with an evening of good fun."
3,Very entertaining,"This may not be a work of art, especially by today's standards, but it is funny and cheerful, and the tunes will keep you humming for weeks. That makes up for a lot. It's ENTERTAINING - not thought-provoking, not intellectual, it doesn't strive to be a wonder of modern theater (even for the days it was created). It's an amusing family film and does its job very well."
5,Happiest Millionaire,"One of the only places to see John Davidson in a movie role. Also a good introduction for Lesley Ann Warren. Greer Garson is certainly an elegant lady! Tommy Steele is a ""scene stealer"", his Irish helps move the story along!"
4,Great Clasic Movie,"From the days of ""squeeky clean movies"". In those days, we loved Fred Mc Murray and the then alive Walt Disney. This movie can be used today to examine the people of those days and relate to them. We purchased this movie to send to our grandkids. They are being raised in solid Christian triditions. This movie is a ""growth"" movie for them."
3,Second tier Disney,This is just as goofy as I remembered it from when it was first released. It is from a different era and not to be taken to seriously so it can be enjoyed. Thank goodness for Tommy Steele he helps bring this up to a better film than it should be.
2,Stick to the Exorcist!!!!!!!,"This book is okay. But if you're looking for great horror read the Exorcist, don't waste your time with this book."
2,terrible for young kids,This is read by a voice that has no animation and very monotonous. The read every single word in the acknowledgments before even beginning the book and the pictures are so small you can barely see them.
2,Does not read well on Kindle,The story is great and my kids love it. However the page breaks are awkward and the pictures don't match the text on the pages. Some of the pictures are very small and smashed to the top of the page. I wish I had been able to see how it was laid out on the kindle before I bought it.
2,"Good Story, Poor on Kindle","The story itself is fine, albeit a little ADD in the usual Curious George manner. The main issue is again the Kindle format of this book. It's simply horrible to read to a child as the flow of words/pictures don't appear together on the same page, and make it impossible to read to your child from the Kindle.I was very excited to see children books for the Kindle as it would allow me to bring a few books on the Kindle instead of lugging around physical books. Apparently, I'll still be lugging around the physical books."
3,History- Not Mystery!,"I read Catalina's Riddle because I enjoy historical fiction and historical mysteries in particular. It is the first book of Steven Saylor's that I read and I must say I am not really interested in reading any others. While I enjoyed the depth of character of Gordianus the Finder, I found that Gordianus mostly fretted over the mystery for the entire book, instead of working to find clues, etc. The mystery is revealed at the end with information we would not have gleaned from the story, so this is not for readers who like to figure out the clues for themselves as they go along. And while the history of early Rome is interesting, the book was overly concerned with detailed political information best suited for textbooks rather than a novel. I ususally like to read all of a series once I get started, but this time I am not going to."
3,Gordianus goes gay!,"I'm enjoying this series a lot. They make great airplane books. There were many aspects of CATALINA'S RIDDLE that I really enjoyed, like the details of Roman life and the rather titillating scene wherein our hero is seduced by another man. The characters of Gordianus and his family became much deeper in this volume. However, the parts that dealt with the Cataline conspiracy were dull, dull, dull in comparison to the parts dealing with Gordianus, his family, and his neighbors. There was too much history and not enough mystery. The Cataline background overwhelmed this installment of Saylor's Sub Rosa series. I enjoyed this book's humor and irony, but it was not as consistently entertaining as the previous volumes."
3,My Review of Catilina's Riddle,"This book is not a literary masterpiece. It requires little on the part of the reader. I would recommend it to anyone who needs to read a long book but does not want to think very hard while reading it. I found about 20 pages in the book engaging, which in my opinion is not enough for a 460 page novel. The situation of the main character, Gordianus, is unrealistic. He is not a very complex character, and I did not identify with or admire him. I just was not engaged by the plots. The end is not predictable, which is a plus in a mystery. Overall, Catilina's Riddle simply is not challenging enough to remain interesting."
3,"Mystery disappointing, the mystery was the excuse...",The mystery of Mr. Saylor's book was so disappointing. The solution came at the end out of nowhere in the plot... it seemed just gratuitous to be written as a mystery at all. And it had such potential! The relationship between the protagonist and his sons Eco and Meto was fabulous and engaging. The existence of a mysterious mine and thousands of bones and skulls could have really gone somewhere.... but in the end the last 8th of the book just bored me to tears and I found myself skipping speech after speech about the politics of the time rather than the plot just to find out how the book ends.
4,A Second Glance At Rome,"I once thought of Rome as a city of great power, wealth, and beauty; but the tragic accounts depicted through this novel alter all that is pure and honest. It reveals a side of Rome I have never encountered, uncovering mysteries, lies, and corruption. I found myself in Gordianus' shoes, being drawn in to every plot, searching for the truth, and never knowing who could be trusted. Having such immense twists and turns led the book to being highly enjoyable. With such a compelling mystery, blended in with that of Roman politics, it produced such a gripping thriller that will leave the reader guessing until the end."
5,The best just keeps coming.,Steven Saylor just keeps doing an excellent job. His work is above reproach I want to see more of it.
4,Steven Saylor historical novels,"Steven writes a very interesting historical series of novels about ancient Rome. I love the details of the food they ate, the clothing and housing. I also love the stories about cities around Italy and can relate to them after visiting Italy in 2010."
5,"A well-crafted blend of mystery, history and character.","Steven Saylor continues his fine Roma sub rosa series of mysteries framed by incidents in the turbulent era of late Republican Rome.Drawn reluctantly into a web of political machination and murder, Gordianus the Finder (Saylor's toughminded sleuth) must solve a baffling crime andextricate himself and his family from peril. The delineation of Roman life and society is extraordinary; even better are the characters--Gordianusespecially is fully realized, an intelligent, complex man of his times. Any reader of historical fiction such as ""I, Claudius"" as well as any mystery-loverwill enjoy this book, and will be hunting for the rest of the series as soon as they put it down. Highly recommended!"
3,It's easy to lose the mystery in the politics of this novel.,"Steven Saylor immerses himself too much in the politics of this noveland the book drags. There is not the sense of urgency that is presentin his other novels, nor is there a clear-cut plot to follow. The bookis still worth reading because it does delve into the political tensionof the day. However, Gordinius is tired in this novel -- tired of citylife and tired of political scheming. He seeks to protect his family fromthe schemes of others, but is unable to. If you've read the other Saylor novelsread this one -- if only to find out what happens to his family. If youlove the political aspects of his books, you'll love this novel. However,if you're reading it for the mystery, skip this book and go directly toVenus Throw where Saylor is back in top form."
4,Bucolic Rome,"This is the third novel in the Gordianus series. In it, Gordianus, disgusted at the political corruption in Rome, moves his family to the countryside, where he expects to find peace and harmony. And escape from the politics of Rome. In reading this book I was reminded of what one of my college professors used to say: ""Our problems aren't new: they were all experienced by the Romans."" And just as we can't escape to the countryside and leave politics behind, so Gordianus can't, either. The corruption, like an octopus, has its tentacles everywhere. Gordianus's young daughter, Diana, discovers a headless corpse in their ""idyllic"" country villa, and the murder is tied to the political rivalries in Rome: Cicero versus Catalina. Because Cicero is Gordianus's patron, Gordianus feels he must help Cicero by solving the mystery. An enjoyable read, with situations that, though 2,000 years old, ring true today."
3,Catillina's Riddle Review,"This is the first Steven Saylor novel I have read. Fans of Steven Saylor will recognize the main character Gordianus from previous novels. Gordianus is peacefully settled on an Etruscan farm which he has inheirited from Lucius Claudius. Gordianus has left Rome and retired from his dangerous work. Gordianus reliniquishes his title of Gordianus the Finder to Gordianus the Farmer. His peaceful farm life is soon disrupted as he is drawn into the Catiline conspiracy by Cicero. One of the most interesting elements of the book is how Saylor analyzes the Catiline conspiracy. Catillina is not portrayed as the destroyer of Rome. However Saylor lets the reader draw their own conclusion on the character of Catilina. I found this a very entertaining novel, and it is a must read for any Saylor Fan. 3 stars"
3,NOT SAYLOR'S BEST...,"Although I'm a big fan of Steven Saylor, this book seemed too slow for me. The ""mistery part"" of the plot is weak and predictable.Nonetheless, the scene in which Catilina tries to seduce Gordianus in his sauna, while Meto is hiding nearby is absolutely remarkable. I enjoyed every single word of the dialogue. Gordianus' response will remain in my memories for a long long time..."
3,"had to read it for school, but overall good book","Catilina's Riddle was a decent book. I have read better and have read worse. It offers great insight into the Catilinarian conspiracies which has never been offered by history. The one thing that I disliked about the book was that some parts I felt were too slow. Being a 450+ page book, there are bound to be slow parts, but I felt the author dwelt too much on the Roman Civilization. I enjoyed very much the action parts and the parts which dealt with the mystery of the story, because the author developed those very well. However, I was not very interested in the learning the background of the story as much the author did. The background might be your favorite part of the book, but it was not for me. --- steve brown"
4,Would have been better without the history lesson,"This was my introduction to this series and it was good enough to make me want to read others, but I hope they aren't quite so heavy on the history lessons. Huge sections of the book slow to a crawl while the author innundates us with minutae of Roman politics and history. If I *were* interested in those topics, I'd read a non-fiction book!When the book focuses on the the main characters, it proves to be extremely interesting. I liked Gordianus the ""Finder"" and his family and think Saylor is a particularly fine wordsmith. I am encouraged by several of the reviews to hope that other entries in the series deal more with everyday life in Rome than with the political intriques of the day.As a fan of historical fiction, this ranks higher than most (although for ancient Rome, I prefer the Marcus Didius Falco Mystery series by Lindsey Davis, and Kate Sedley's ""Chapman"" series retains its status as favorite among all historical fiction)."
2,Too Thin,The idea for the book has great potential--and some of the children's letters are very cute--but the book itself is simply too thin to merit the rave reviews that others have given it. I was disappointed that the book had so little material and it would be hard for me to recommend it at the published price.
5,Adorable Innocence!,"Cutest book EVER. I love how the letters range from just hilarious to 'awwww' to sad. The funniest ones were the ""bowling words"" one and the Edison one XD It's just really refreshing to see kids talk about something as serious as God in such an adorable way, and the wacky ways they can interpret religion. I really hope there's another compilation, that'd be epic. I also wonder how they were compiled--were they letters found by postal workers, or did they gather a bunch of kids and tell them to write a letter to God, or what? Amazing read though, everyone should read it :)"
2,Even cheaper than expected,"From the description and price, I knew this would be a cheap product. But, this was even more craptacular than I thought it would be. One of the screw holes is so tight that the screw got jammed. The knobs are just a soft plastic clamped on one end. While trying to get the screw out, the plastic knob partially disconnected and just spins freely now. That screw isn't moving anywhere unless I take a hammer to it now. I need the stand ASAP though, and can't get another one in time. Oh well. You get what you pay for.(I don't blame Amazon... this is a manufacturing issue)"
5,Good product and my tortoise is happy,I have a baby leopard tortoise and he is super happy with my purchase. I was using the lamp with the clamp before and it was still too close and hot. Now I can adjust how close or far I want his lamp and he is in perfect warm (not hot) basking temperature.I am LAUGHING at the person who complained about not having directions for putting this together. It is really easy to do and you really don't need directions. Just look at the picture on the box...it took me under a minute to put it together (if that). *giggles* I can't believe someone wrote a negative review for having no instructions. It's easier than a 10 piece puzzle...LOL
4,"Expensive, but nice to have","I used to just set my turtle lamp directly on top of the tanks lid, but I felt like it might be too close to her and I wanted to make it less so. This is the best way I could think of, but I was hesitant because of the price. I gets the job done and does it well."
2,it's ok.,"The structure is a little wobbly, and it says you can use the double dome light fixture with it, but it only has a place to run one cord, so the other is left dangling and it doesn't look very good."
3,OK for the price,I needed something to hang my Zoo Med combo lamp fixture from. This looked good on the site but in reality it's not as well made as it could be. I'm sure it would be fine for a single lamp but it's hard to keep the lamp balanced. It was very easy to set up although I wish the bottom platform had a way to attach to the tank. It just sets under the tank and I have my tank set up on small feet as I have a heating pad underneath for the winter time as well.
1,worst product I've ever bought on Amazon,"My zoo-med lamp stand came in the mail today and I was very excited about it. I opened the box and started to put it together. Everything was going well until I got to the top part of the stand. The hole for the screw wasn't even punched all the way through and when I tried to put the screw/knob in the hole it wouldn't go all the way and then it got stuck. Maybe it was just bad luck, but I wouldn't trust buying this item from Amazon."
4,Flexibility for Your Pets,I bought this to replace my steamer. Why steamer? Well that is what I was using to keep the heat lamp in my turtle tank at a proper distance and maintain the proper temperature.The stand is solid steel. Has a good weight and very adjustable. You can use it for pretty much any lamp. It has a professional look to it. Hard to beat for the price. My turtles are happy.
4,great product,Product works as described. The construction of it is a little questionable but overall good. I am pleased with it.
4,Works great!,"We bought 2 of these stands, one for our beardie and one for our water turtles. I like how easily adjustable it is since we seem to have to move the bulb distance every one in awhile to keep our beardies cage at the perfect temp. Just wish I would have gone to our local pet store chain first since they were cheaper than online"
4,"Zoo Med Reptile Lamp Stand, Full Size","This is perfect to use for tanks and setups that do not have hoods. The only problem that I had with it is that directions were not included. Once I figured out how it was supposed to go, however, it took like 3-5 minutes tops to set it up."
2,Awful 80's-era TV production,"I give this DVD 5 stars for baseball, but zero for its simply awful 80's-era TV production styles. The main problem with this video is that the majority of at-bats are NOT shown. So you have no way of really following how the games developed. Only key plays are shown, but usually you are just dropped into the situation (runners, outs, etc.). The rest of the time is filled with some truly awful musical sequences of players and fans.For the baseball that is actually shown, this video is a lot better than nothing. You get some great moments with Whitey, Ozzie, Willie, and a the rest of the Cardinals 80's-era greats. But you also have the pain of watching the Cardinals loose two of three World Series.For the record, I'd like to say that Don Denkinger's call at first in game 6 of the '85 series was completely and utterly wrong. This video proves it."
2,T. Martin,"nice to look at, however must be handled with care...glass is very thin and breaks, chips, easily....also be sure to NEVER put in the dishwasher as the decorative features on the glass simply dissolve.....I would not order these again..."
1,paint comes off,I got these as a gift from my in-laws. I was thrilled until I was hand washing them in warm water and all the red paint came off the stem and base. I am so disappointed because I really love these glasses. Don't bother with these unless they are for display only.
1,Even handwashing removes designs,"I bought these to use on my Christmas table and was surprised when I was hand washing them on Christmas Eve (their first washing) that the red paint, on the bottom of the glasses, started to crack and lift off. Very disappointed with this cheaply made product; this used to be a good brand."
1,Very Disappointed!,I recieved a set of 4 for Christmas and thought it would be nice to purchase another set of 4. I hand washed the set I recieved for Christmas in Dawn dishsoap and luke warm water and the paint came off - every single one of these glasses. I would not recommend these at all.
1,Disappointment,I can't believe these are still being sold. All the designs washed off the very first time I washed them by hand.
2,"Pretty to look at, but . . .","I bought these beautiful goblets, the matching water pitcher, and the matching serving bowl. I was surprised at how thin the glass was, but that was nothing compared to my next surprise. I put them in the sink to hand wash them, and walked away for about 5 minutes. When I returned it looked like red cellophane floating in the water. The ""red glass"" stem and base of the glasses was peeling off in strips. I was shocked to then see the holly berries coming off as well. I hoped it was just the glasses-no such luck. The red handle of the pitcher is now clear and the red bases of all of the pieces peeled off. It seriously looked like they were wrapped in cellophane. I returned them the next day and called Pfaltzgraff to complain. I will wait to see how amazon.com handles the return, but I really don't expect any problem. The stoneware is fine, but the glassware is such a disappointment."
4,Beautiful but VERY delicate,"Glasses are absolutely beautiful, exactly as pictured. I guess I didn't read the fine print, glasses are super fragile. Definitely can not put in the dishwasher. I have 3 kids do not think I would have bought if I would have realized how dainty they are. Also on the stem the red coloring is coming off, it is not chipped just wearing and I have only had them for 2 weeks. So I will contact Amazon and see how they handle this."
5,Great gift for someone who has the dinnerware,My cousin has the dinnerware. I got her the goblets as a gift and she loves them.
2,Beautiful but extremely fragile,"These are beautiful glasses, thus they rate 2 stars. If not for their exceptional look, I would give them 0 stars. These glasses are more fragile than any I have ever owned. I knew the glass was very thin and so took great care with the glasses, yet one still broke during its first use. These glasses are almost useless for actual use, might be ok for display only. Even very light use at Christmastime, with great care taken, is likely to result in breakage. To top it off, they can NEVER be put in the dishwasher. I would not recommend these glasses."
1,Faulty glassware,Bought 8 of these glasses to use for Christmas dinner. I already had the wine glasses to match. When I put them in the sink with mild soap and luke warm water to wash them all the red color on the bottom began to come off. Every one of them peeled to the point they were clear. It was to late to return them and get replacements so I gave them away. Never had a problem with the matching wine glasses which I have even washed in the dishwasher and they were fine.
2,Pretty but Decorations wipe off with first hand-wash,"I bought these as a part of the Pfaltzgraff winterberry plate collection, thinking they would be the same sturdy make as the plates and cups are (very nice set by the way). I was wrong. The glass is very thin. I wouldn't risk putting them in the hands of anyone younger than a well-mannered teenager, since they are quite fragile.The painted on decoration was also a problem. It just came off in my bare hands as I hand-washed them. I thought I had cut myself with all the red that flaked off the base, and there were tiny holly berries floating in my sink.They were fairly cheap at something like $20 for a set of 4, but I would recommend looking elsewhere for your holiday drinking cheer. I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because they really are quite pretty to use...even as a one-off use. :)"
2,Botton peels off,"This is my pattern and I have lots of it. However the red on the bottom is only a covering and even with careful handwashing the ""wrap"" will begin to peel off. It's very disappointing for such a reputable company like Pfalzgraff. I purchased the wineglasses (8) at the same time and the same thing is happening to them. I do not recommend this product."
3,glass ware,beautiful but cheaply made. They look beautiful on the table but the glass is cheap and can break and chip VERY easily.
1,Do Not Buy This Product!!!,"The worst product I have purchased in over 60 years. Rinsed the brand new glasses in room temperature water, no soap, and coloring washed out on the glasses. These guys should be arrested for fraud!!!!"
2,Loosely coupled - arrogant attitude,"I am uninterested in the authors opinion on this and that. I do not need to be looked down upon because I made something that the author thinks is inappropriate or possibly ridiculous. What I am looking for in a profesional book is vision, possiblity, technique, option and positive experience.When the author argues that 'just throw in as many as you need to keep your users happy' as he does for aggregates I loose my potential profesional respect for that author and put the book aside as untrustworthy. I know very well that I get an unwanted result because I am missing some possibly good points, but the simple nuiscense I get from reading the book leads me to other souces.A final question: why would I need the proposed aggregates when I have materialized views? If anyone would like to answer my mail id is njessen@sol.dk."
4,Pretty good if you can get past the attitude,"The book offers a number of detailed tuning tips and insights from Mr. Scalzo's real world experience. That being said, the tone of the writing is really annoying. Mr. Scalzo's condescending style is unnecessary and takes away from what could be a very good book. At points, I actually broke out in laughter at his arrogance. However, if you can get past the author's attitude the content of the book seems to be quite helpful."
5,"awesome, pragmatic, authoritative, factual 9i DW book","Bert has written a very good book that's full of real life empirical facts and experiences, mainly from building a vary vary large DW for 7/11. Bert does especially good job describing I/O, partitioning, spindles. His section on high speed / high volume data loader techniques is also very very good.I have been leading / managing / directing / coding Oracle software development projects for 15 years for 3 Fortune 100 companies, and am both technical as well as ""functional"". Highly recommend Bert's book for DBA's, SA's, designers, programmers, technical project managers."
2,Unprofessional style and lack of knowledge,"The author definitely has an arrogant style of writing. The book just talks about one way of doing things without being open about other possible better ways of designing and implementing efficient techniques. Oracle features such as partitioning, materialized views, external tables are not done enough justice.Data warehouse requirements are much more than the two-dimentional approach discussed. There is minimal or no discussion of performance at the system level taking into account infrastruture, architecture, query optimizaion, front-end tools etc.A very narrow outlook on datawarehouse implementations."
2,They don't last,I ordered two of these 150W lamps and neither bulbs lasted more than approximately 1500 hours. Half of what they're supposed to. Expensive. Where does one complain?
1,Don't Bother,This light burned out in less than 3 weeks. Save your money for some other brand. Its a very expensive light for only lasting 3 weeks.
2,Buy 10!,"Maybe I didn't use them as designed. I had them outdoors to heat my chicken coop. I bought 2, and each one lasted about 2 weeks."
1,Blew out on the second day,I have it setup on a dimmer switch and it lasted one night. Not worth the hassle to send it back.
2,went out after 3 weeks,"I used this for only 21 nights before the light burnt out. Maybe it was just a defect, but I won't buy another one."
1,My snake Mark,"The spot lamps I received came in a timely fashion,work well,and werehalf the price I have been paying.My snake Mark is very happy."
4,good value,"This works for the money to keep a reptile tank warm..jopefully it will last, these are known for blowing out quick"
1,"The item was advertised as a lamp, with a picture of a lamp with a bulb, but it only included the bulb","This was advertised in a misleading way - with a picture of a lamp, but it only included the light bulb, not the lamp - so we ended up having to go to a local pet store to get a lamp (which already included the bulb so was a waste of money)."
1,Piece of junk,"It lasted two weeks, and that's only a few hours a day. The bulb seperated, fell and shattered. And that was when I turned it on. JUNK!"
2,Heat Lamps,"I bought 3 of these lights and 1 has already gone bad on me. It didn't last a month. So far the other one I've put in has been working properly. The 1st one may not have been a good bulb, we'll see."
4,inspirational,"Every photo in this book is beautiful and very inspirational. It loses one star for me bc a lot of the pictures show beautiful houses with spiral staircases, huge windows that take up an entire wall, sky lights, and tons of furniture that I couldn't afford any time soon. I live in a rental so I am not able to remodel like these photos. Would have been nice if the book explained what to do when you lack natural sunlight or what to do in tight spaces. But I will for sure use the decorations as ideas to cozy up my home and the chapters on how to toss out the unimportant will definately help my husband the ""pack rat""."
5,Easy reading print - nice combination,"I've long been a fan of the Chicken Soup for the Soul series of books. The New Living Translation of the Bible is easy to understand in more contemporary language, while still being an actual translation vs. a paraphrase. This is a nice balance of meshing stories and commentary with the biblical text without being heavily academic. It would be great if this were offered with other translations and in other covers (i.e. leather). Many have a particular version of the Bible that is the only one they'll use, so they wouldn't give the current product a second look. If the Chicken Soup parts were offered with NIV, KJV or any of the other primary translations it would find a broader readership/customer base."
2,Warehouse damage?,"This is the third time I have returned this item because of the SAME damage (denting on a long edge). It is possible I am getting the same table over and over again, but more likely, I think the damage occurred to a number of tables at a distribution center that these tables are being pulled from. I love Lifetime tables, but whomever is shipping these to us has not read my packaging feedback. The packaging may and may not be the problem, but I would like to have human interaction to help me with this problem so we can get an undamaged table. Harumph!"
3,Suitable for use,Our experience with the 6 foot tables has been better than the 8 foot models. Still note that there are scratches and would hope for something better.
2,poor quality,Table was damaged when shipped and the table top is not very rugged. We keep the table as we are going to cover it.
2,Buy a hard copy.,"Of course this book's content is valuable and well-written. However, I was extremely disappointed with the electronic version. There are no page numbers, which makes the book very difficult to use in classes where some people have a hard copy. The pages turn extremely slowly, which is fine for reading, but horrible when trying to flip around and locate information. In-text citations conveniently link to the bibliography, but if the citation happens to be close to the edge of the page, the page would rather turn than direct you to your citation. Basically, if all you want to do is read the book, the electronic version is fine, but using it for class discussions or writing papers is tough. There are a lot of other things I could say, but the final result for me was that I returned this version to buy a hard copy."
5,Western Four-Pack,"This is a good collection of westerns. They are in there own respected cases (is in a 14mm standard case and not a slim) and with there own scene selection inserts.

3,Western Four-Pack,Excellent Movies. The only complaints is the bad packing of the box set by the company and the dvd was slightly damaged by this. I will think twice before buying from this company again unless they have a better packaging.David Heath
4,Tres Flores Brillantina (Three Flowers Brilliantine),"This product reminds you of another well known PETROLEUM BASED pomade, Tres Flores (Three Flowers). I purchased this product thinking that I was going to get what the label states ""100% PURE AUSTRALIAN BEESWAX"". This product, though, is PETROLEUM BASED (petroleum jelly) and has mixed in it the beeswax, so the label is a bit misleading. The product smells good enough to put in your hair, if that's why you are buying it, but if you really wanted 100% Beeswax then this is not what you want to buy. ""amazon.com"" should list the ingredients to this product so that consumers know exactly what they are buying. I would use this product on my own head, but unfortunately I shave my head and therefore have no real use for it. I gave this product 4 stars for what it is intended for, not because I bought something I don't need."
5,Excellent,Works well and smells great. I would recommend this product.I don't have any other was to compare with but like this item a lot.
5,wax,"I have used this Bees wax to protect the cylinder from multiple firing on my, black powder, Colt 44. It seems excellent"
2,Strong smell,"Not good, strong smell!I ordered two kind of beeswax, this one is not good. It smells strange and makes this feel non-natural even it is. So I have to through it away."
5,Works for my woodworking projects,"I wanted %100 pure beeswax to use in my shop as a lubricant for screws before driving them into cabinets and other hardwood projects I build. By dipping the screw into the Beeswax first, this helps them go in smoothly by lubricating them and helps to seal them into the wood so they don't come loose later! Thank Amazon, very FAST as usual. Keep up the good work!! Completely satisfied!!"
2,4 film romances dvd,"Other than Don Juan Demarco this is a group of childishly written romances. Reminds me of those dime store romance books. So sad to see such good actors in such cliche and predictable love situation comedies. Think ""Hallmark"" channel."
1,Dim Sum: a Pocket Guide,"Expensive for size and information provided. I was very disappointed and do not recommend it.Instead, I suggest purchasing Dim Sum: a survival guide by Liza Chu - it's a little bigger butmore comprehensive."
5,Dim Sum...Yum Yum! (from the book),"This is a great little pocket guide to Dim Sum. It offers beautiful photos of each delicious dumpling as well as the name of the item, a pronunciation guide and Chinese characters in case you don't feel comfortable attempting the language (but you should, it's a lot of fun and educational). This little book also offers a legend of how tea was discovered and the way to subtly ask for more when you dine. It also shows the newbie to eating with chopsticks how to hold them.It's not comprehensive for everything, but it's a great start."
5,A must have,I have owned this for 6 years now ( give or take a year) and it still works perfect..It's a must have for smokers..
5,Industrial,"This thing has such a high quality almost ""industrial"" feeling about it. I could literally knock someone out with this thing. Anyways it does its job very will, in addition to grinding and shredding your herbs of choice it also collects pollen very well with the metal screen and lower compartment."
3,Comprehensive But Shallow,"The positive: The book has entries for just about every native tribe and mythological personage on the American continent, from the Arctic North to the southernmost tip of South America. It is amazingly complete in that sense. There are at least one or two full-color photos per page. The entries are extensively cross-referenced to each other, and overall the book is very well produced.The negative: most entries are fairly short (longer than a dictionary, but shorter than a real encyclopedia) and don't have enough context to make them understandable to the average reader. If you're not an expert, it is very unlikely that this book will make much sense to you; if you are an expert, you will want much more information than you can find here."
2,Boring Meanderings from an Egghead about Charlie Manson,"Most of this is Zaehner trying to draw a connection between Charles Manson and the darkside of eastern religion and philosophy. He does this from the viewpoint of an egghead academic, not, as you might have expected, a right wing Christian. I thought this might be interesting in a mental masterbatory kind of way or that Zaehner might make a few valid and/or interesting points. Its not and he doesn't."
4,"Quality jersey, especially if you like titanium.","I got this jersey and the ""Titanium"" logos would compliment my titanium plate i got in my shoulder after a bike crash. Its a comfy and stylin jersey that has held up to multiple washings with no fading. If you wear it with a messenger bag or back pack expect some ""pilling"" of the fabric where the strap crosses. Also if wearing a bag on your back there's a zipper on the back center zip pocket that will be pressed into your back. I would describe it as a roomy ""club-cut""."
5,It is named perfectly!,"The Ultimate Family Wagon has been perfectly named! This durable, colorful, efficient, and purposeful wagon has the ability to take your child, his toys and needs, your little extras, and/or take along another child for a compact, safe, secure ride. The canopy is an additional feature for protection from the sun for your little ones sensitive skin. Assembly was quick due to the easy to follow directions provided. The wagon was purchased as one of our grandson's First Birthday presents, after his parent's had completed much research on the wagon of their choice. We wheeled in the wagon with Winnie the Pooh in one seat and the remaining gifts scattered about the remainder of the wagon. Our grandson's eyes turned as large as saucers as he watched us approach. Several of the parents attending this party wanted to know where we purchased the wagon, with the intent of procurring the wagon for their child, too! It is the Ultimate Family Wagon."
4,Very good wagon,"For the price, we got what we paid for. The canopy works well on sunny days. Our 15 month old seems to like it. The cup holders come in handy for sippy cups and bottles. They also work for keys and other miscellaneous things. The canopy assembles in about a couple of minutes when we reassemble it from our minivan. It fits in the back of our minivan and still have room for a stroller and an utility box for storage. We have a late model Sienna. I only have one comment about the initial assembly of the wagon. Like most other fathers, I did not read the instruction as closely as I should. I put one of the washers in the wrong order and I had to disassemble the cap that holds the wheel together. It was a b*&^% to remove. Just read the instructions carefully, otherwise it is a great wagon."
4,Radio Flyer Ultimate Family WagonTM,"I bought this toy for my two young daughters as a christmas present. So haven't really gotten much use out of it yet. I love the idea of the versatility in seating, and of course the cup holders for the driver. After using a dual stroller without cupholders I decided to pay the extra money for a model that included the extra cupholders. It was easy to put together and seems like it will be very durable. The shade is a little awkward to put on and store and doesn't seem like it will be very effective coverage for two occupants. But that's not what I bought it for, so hasn't affected my review."
5,Wagons are FUN!,"We bought this wagon for our grandkids, 19 months and almost 3. They have used it for long walks and excursions to the town center, a mile away, with the kids riding. But, wagons are fun! After loading it full of cardboard for a walk to the recycling center, the 3 yo boy decided he wanted to pull it himself. It was great. They love it. I highly recommend it. Anne Gomes"
5,Radio Flyer Ultimate Family Wagon,"We haven't used this on a vacation yet (though we plan to in a couple of weeks), but my kids already love this wagon. At a recent birthday party at my house the kids wanted to take turns getting pulled around the yard in it. We also love the canopy! It will work out great for our upcoming vacation."
4,If there was just one thing I'd like to see different,"Our two kids have the best time chatting and interacting with each other in this. They often fall off to sleep when we go on long walks. It folds easily and the canopy is the jewel in the crown. I wish I had bought it much earlier. Anyways , if you are still reading this and want to know what I would like different here.....its the wheels ! I wish they were the real tires which can be inflated with air. I think it would have made the ride even smooth on dirt roads. I mean if you are on paved surface, its no problem but I find us often taking the wagon to a semi dirt roads when outdoors. We've even taken this to camp on Angel Island. I considered going for the classic but the flat bed does not seem as fun as the folding seats on this one."
5,Great wagon!,"We wanted light weight, durable for camping or parades, big enough for a 3 and a 4 year old. This had it all! The canopy is adorable. The kids love it!"
5,Fantastic addition....,"Radio Flyer is a great tool, espeically for twins. Our twins enjoy it very much. Assembly is easy, but you need to be careful about the washer (which are two different sizes, an inch, and 1 1/2 inch. If you interchange, you need to struggle with wirecutter forever (of course, aftering getting the spares from customer service folks). Just take couple of minutes to review before you hammer it!"
4,"Love This Wagon, but.....","I absolutley love this wagon! The only things I have a problem with is the canopy top - the middle rod I always have a problem with getting to stay up, but once I figured out the ""secret"" to it, it works like a charm. Also that it's too big for my Sedan! Otherwise, I think this is the greatist wagon ever! I get compliments on it wherever I go. I love the storage space and the canopy top!"
4,Grand daughters Radio Flyer Wagon,"My 13 month grand daughters love it. The wheels are a hard plastic, and I am not sure how good they will hold up if wagon is used in the street, which ours will be. The babies got the wagon for Christmas, so it hasn't been used very much yet, so I can't really comment on the wearability of the wagon. I like the idea of having the visor over the top, especially here in Texas. The 2 seats is a big plus."
3,Arrived with broken parts,"Very nice wagon except it arrived with two defective parts relating to the canopy which the manufacturer will need to mail us. The first was the part which locks the canopy post into the wagon was cracked, apparently during assemply, and the other was the canopy stitching was coming apart at the seem.This is the second Radio Flyer product we purchased (the other was a tricycle) which arrived with defective parts needing replaced, which makes me question their quality control. Otherwise we have no complaints, and my daughter loves it."
4,Great wagon!,"We bought this wagon first and foremost to cart our kids around when we go places like the zoo. It replaced another, smaller wagon that wasn't nearly as nice. This thing just flat out rocks my socks off, at least as much as a plastic wagon can.Assembly was very straight forward, took me about 15 minutes, including an interruption or two from the kids. I was very apprehensive about a wagon that uses free-spinning front wheels, not tied into the handle, but now I'm a believer -- this thing handles great.The seats are nice and configurable, allowing you to have the kids face each other, or sit facing the same way, storage that neither kid can reach, and even has the canopy you can optionally attach.The price tag, while a bit steep, isn't unmanageable, and I'd recommend this without reservation."
4,Durable and fun wagon for 2,"The Radio Flyer Ultimate Family Wagon is a great wagon; durable and comfortable for 2 kids. My 2 year old son loves to pull the wagon, and when he gets tired, he climbs in. I like this particular one because it doesn't have a door. It can keep the kids contained. Also, the storage space is nice and can hold little things; however, I would have like to see more storage space."
5,Very nice wagon,"Our son got this from Mimi for his first birthday. It seems very durable, has many cup holders, and the canopy is very nice in the sun. It's seats are convertible, with the options to have two seats, or one seat and a table for snacks or toys. It is a very smooth ride, and perfect for a stroll around the block or yard. :)"
3,Wipes great...packaging terrible,"The box of Germ X wipes was shipped in an envelope much too small for the contents. As a result, the entire box was in pieces (making dispersing the small packages of wipes in the box impossible...no remains of the box!)."
5,Great for the Gym!,"I use one of these wipes at the gym to wipe off the treadmill before and after I use it. My gym has the mystery spray bottle of ""disinfectant"" that I'm not really sure actually sanitizes anything. These are super convenient to keep a few in my gym and make me feel much more comfortable using the equipment! They are a generous size and very cloth-like for disposable wipes. I'm a happy customer!"
3,"Not too impressed, but decent speakers","I bought these hoping to have better power than they exhibit. Some of the reviews were glowing. I believe the sound is about average, and the volume is rather limited due to distortion. They are a great size, and I will take them with me when I move cross country, but I would buy a more powerful model next time."
5,Nice older book!,"I am a long time UFO researcher and I found this book really helpful. It presents the facts from an objective view, and gives you the officially released documents proving that what happened is true. It may be a bit outdated, but for serious UFO researchers it may come in handy!"
3,Probably made in China,"When looking at this product, I assumed it was made in China since it does not say where it was made. With all of the lead paint recalls from Chinese made toys, it is hard to consider something which is designed to be put in a child's mouth that is made in China, Especially with high-temperature water which is highly reactive.So I went to True Value Hardware and found one (Fielder Keepsakes) which is made in the USA."
5,Differentiate Your Instruction,"This is a ""must have book"" for ALL educators. It's a wonderful resource to use and to share with your colleagues. I highly recommend it for both regular classroom teachers and gifted teachers."
1,Rip Off/False Advertising,"Games should state explicitly on the Box ""Online Only"" One of the Worst RPG's ever experienced. Company should be SUED!!!"
1,horrible,Three words: get xbox version!!!!!!It has better graphics and doesnt need fancy software.(yes you want software to make two worlds even look somwhat good). with the xbox version you can just sit down and play instead of installing it for one hour which is really annoying. Xbox or PC... um Xbox duh.Case closed
1,Worthless piece of junk,"Someone took TES III Morrowind and Fable TLC, chopped em up and put em in a blender and out popped two worlds. This game is so awful that I felt literally sick after only 5 minutes of play. Oh lets not forget having to activate it online before I could even use it. This game has been an utter waste of $50 and over 3 hours of my time. Its like lighting a $50 bill on fire and watching it burn but much less entertaining than that would be. Please save your hard earned money and buy something else.Graphics = BadSound = averagestory = unoriginalvoice over = worse than a cheap Chinese filmcontrols = HorribleCharacter creation/modification = sub parAll in all South peak didn't try very hard and it shows, badly."
1,"Searching for the ""taint"" has never been so un-rewarding.","Yes thats right in the game there is an evil force or item called the ""Taint"" (not too sure i quit after an hour of the nonsense) I was willing to look past the poor graphics but then my character began to speak in what was probably the most corny voice ive ever heard. I have never actually encountered a game that i was so dissappointed with that i had to uninstall it and throw it away but this game certainly deserved it. To be blunt, the graphics sucks, the voice acting sucks, the controls suck, the story sucks. All in all it is a massive waste of money and time. Although, there is nothing more hilarious than hearing the characters speak of the ""Taint"" in such a serious manner. So the game is good for a couple cheap laughs and nothing else."
5,pretty plates!,So far I haven't had any problems with these pretty plates. I wash them in the dishwasher and they take abuse from my kids.
3,Divided Dinner Plate,"The plates are really cute - just what I wanted in the plate. However - the darn things don't fit in my microwave at home (!), and I bet they won't fit in the ones at work either. Crap! Buyer beware - if you wanted these to freeze leftovers for work lunches, better measure the microwave first. I'll have to look for smaller ones :("
5,split plate,"love thses, very useful for people that dont like their foods to touch and for little kids, indestructable (to date).... love them and the colorfulness is great."
1,Wrong Part,"The delivered thermostat and housing were/are for the later models, they do not fit on my BMW E39 1997.......The 1997 model uses a separate housing and thermostat, this one comes with a connector etc. and is probably actuated by a sensor"
5,A great reference,"Few books have ever done so much for me. This book has helped me organize so much of my life, it's not even funny.The best part of it, is it's not about making lists and filing papers, it's about what's important to you and really helping you prioritize what really matters in your life.You'll be amazed at how easy it really is to be focused all the time."
4,Great Time-Management Tips to Organize Your Life,"I've read a number of time management books. This was one of the best.This book forces you to think about the *why* behind the things you each day (at home, at work, and for fun). It teaches readers to avoid doing ""what's on top of the pile"" and instead think more in terms of overall life strategy. (e.g. ""For what reason am I doing this?"")Granted, the ""mind mapping"" and endless diagrams can get a little tedious. However, they are necessary for the author to illustrate her points.Much of the listing techniques apply directly to the Franklin Covey Planner organization system. Therefore, if you have the Franklin Covey Planner, this book will be incredibly easy to follow."
3,A little disappointing...,"I was looking forward to seeing Gibson's classic World Series performances, but the editing skipped a ton of details. Not the in depth story I was looking for."
5,charming...remembrance holds me,"This group is amazing - I was with them at the 2007 Magical Mountain Mabon in New Mexico, and took my own part in dancing, drumming, fluting, singing (their songs), merrymaking, and solemn unified promises to the Earth and Heavens with many others there. It was beyond fantastic, and I am sure that these ladies deserve credit for a big part of my sensuous experience there; I know that Oastara is not even upon us yet, as Imbolc (my birthday) just passed, but I feel motivated towards so much more peaceful creative activity, and towards healing others in teaching the Quadrivium and providing shamanic counsel... like two years have gone by!! I think that these months past have supplied me with a great evolution of thought and heart with which to carry on my own gnosis and freely share it. Thanks, Crow Women! I hope to see and hear you soon. I am your friend and local alchemist, close at hand in Durango.Light and Truth,Brendan BombaciDurango, CO"
5,Great Book...not too spicy.,"I agree with the author above but I do believe the recipes are superb and the author is quite a well-respected authority on Greek cooking in particular, as well as the Mediterranean as a whole. Her pepper referneces are not very detailed, it's true. I think professionals still speak to laymen as somewhat simpleminded and in this case, I am a professional. I do think the home cook will find these recipes quite executable and reliable, which is more than I can say for chefs as Batali that always leave a very pertinent ingredient and or step out of the recipe, so your final result will never be as good. This is despicably miserable and stingy. Miss Kremezi does not do that. Like most Greeks, she gives her all. A deserving James Beard Award winner (though not for this book)."
1,Wrong picture,Not a review just a statement. The picture is of a 4 slice toaster not a coffee decanter. It looks like a very nice toaster and I would like to read about IT. Thanks
2,"bad product, now worse","Lacking in flavor, way over-priced, always arrive in a bunch of pieces (This last complaint is a new one. For years Snackwell's cookies, at least, arrived as whole cookies. Now they always look like they've been through some kind of abrading device). Better off buying a high fat cookie and just eating less."
3,CCRevisited singer John Tristao has a new CD,I have played the new disk a few times. There is a rock and country sounds to it depending on the song. You can hear John's nasal twang (reminisient of how he handles the CCR material) on some of the songs but not others. There are probably two or three above average songs on the CD.
3,This movie was decent.,"On the cover it said ""A Clockwork Orange for the nineties"". Not quite! If you enjoy movies about brutality than this is still a pretty good movie! Just because a movie has some ""Ultra Violence"" and a few rape scenes does not mean it can be compared to ""A Clockwork Orange""."
1,rolling scissors,"Cuts very little. I have tried several items and can't cut them. Paper, etc. The scissors are now in my drawer just taking up space. Do not recommend to anyone."
4,"Good show, but definitely for adults!","My husband loves the show, as he is a consultant. He did say that a lot of it is exaggerated, but there are some truths. Don Cheadle is awesome, & Kristin Bell is smart & very funny. Definitely check it out!"
2,Just because it's on Showtime doesn't mean it's good,"House of Lies explores the cutthroat world of management consulting as it follows Marty Kaan (Don Cheadle) and his crew on various assignments across the country. The show moves at a lightning fast pace which severely hinders any sense of drama and character development. By season's end, Cheadle's character is the only one that can be dissected. The subplots are overly simplistic...everyone gets their way by sleeping around. A plethora of sex and nudity is added to each episode because this show has nothing else to offer. Shallow, simple, unchallenging...that's House of Lies. The dvd extras are a major let-down. They are very brief and offer no depth and insight. Interviews with Cheadle and Kristen Bell discussed their first jobs. Why? There is also a photo gallery and cast biographies in text format...2 outdated features that were prominent on dvds during the late 90's"
5,Strange but good,"This is an interesting show. I ordered first episode and will order the first and second season, Don Cheadle never fails to amaze mee as an actor. You should see him in Devil in Blue Dress as Mouse."
3,Los Locos...,"Two gangbangers drive around all night looking for drugs to buy and people to kill. Mostly seated in the car talking, we get endless streams of ""homey"" and other ""street"" dialogue, interrupted occasionally by a strangulation or shooting. Sort of long and repetative, but has a halfway decent ending. Also available on DECREPIT CRYPT OF NIGHTMARES..."
1,poor printing quality,"It looks completely like priting out a scanned electronic version at a low resolution. The text is small, with loads of artefacts. Poor readability."
3,Good tea--but not quite the flavor I wanted,Stash Teas are top notch. I love the packaging and all that...and the quality of Stash Teas.... so when I was looking for lemon tea I decided to try this.As usual this tea looks great with its wonderful lemony color . Very pure looking...and wonderful. Unfortunately--I am not crazy about the taste of this particular blend and I do not LOVE it. I need to LOVE my teas. There is something in this tea --maybe the blossoms. It dosen't taste bad---just not exactly how I would want it to taste.I would still suggest that you try this tea.You may enjoy it more than I...but the next time I'm looking for lemon tea---I will try another brand ! I want a straight lemon taste and thats all. Nothing else !
5,Awesome!,"We went to eat at a restaurant in Indy last Wed. night. Our waiter asked me if I would like some tea for my cold. I said no thank you but he brought it to me anyway. I t was the lemon blossom CAFFEINE FREE and I absolutely loved it. I must admit I liked it better, for me, with a little bit of sugar. This product has revived my taste for tea. Thank you so much for this product."
5,mmmmmmmmmm,"This tea is delicious with no sweetener. Tangy (without being too tangy), refreshing. One of my favorites."
3,Not the best,"I'm not wild about Carlotta's blues hobby -- it seems too forced -- so an entire book centered around it wasn't exactly a page-turner. Karen Kijewski did the ""old friend is a big-time musician with a problem"" better in the Kat Colorado series.I also found the mystery, and the culprit, to be vague. It's a good series, but this definitely wasn't one of the better installments."
2,Omniform Filler,"The software was not what I was looking for, unfortunately, I can't return it. I open it and installed in the computer."
2,Thin,"Very thin. It's just a bunch of (rather voyeuristic) stories, with very little analysis. The idea that competition within one's peer group as an explanation of our consumerist culture is a fascinating one, but it's really not delved into in any depth here."
4,From Green Envey to Red Ink,"If the Jonses matter to you, then this book should matter to you. In it the author will teach you how to finally say: ""It does not matter"" (when you see the Jonses with all their stuff). And maybe she will save you from soul crushing debt. But if you have been living on half your income (like Mr. B Franklin told you to) and you are so focused on doing your own thing that you don't even notice the Jonses Ms. Boss's stories about people living beyond their means, may not mean much to you.I think she is right there is a lot of camouflaged/hidden-wealth here in the Pacific Northwest. But there are, of course, plenty of big spenders who need to read her book, here as well."
2,Would have made a great article,The author has a great title and premise but the book was vague and unfulfilling. I really wanted to like the book but when she made points based on friend of a friend met someone or generalizations it was impossible not to discount her conclusions. The couples profiled gave little information like monthly mortgage payments or future expectations.
2,"2 stars for content, 0 stars for poor writting.","Absolutely terrible. So many good points all jumbled up. It felt like it was written, by a grade 8 English student trying to impress a University crowd. The flow was difficult to grasp and the book lacked that finished up. Maybe she should have spent more time in editing. There were so many grammatical errors.Shira, really you can convey your message without vulgarity. Your book tries to cross the lines of financial insight and a smut paperback. Through a little sex in there and you got a Daniel Steel novel.Really people, there are so many better books out there with the same information in them. Try, Total Money Makeover by Dave Ramsey, or Your Money or Your life by Joe Dominguez. Save your hardback dollars for something a little more professional, and hey Shira please do another revision after you have spent about 6 months cleaning this SH!^ up as you would have put it..."
4,Very Interesting,"This was a very good look at how people view status and financial happiness. It was interesting to see that some of my views were shared by some of the people in the book. I have to say that this book has me looking at my financial situation in a whole new POSITIVE light.This is a book I recommend for everyone, especially those about to start life on their own."
2,It is not just envy,"""Green with Envy"" by Shari Boss is another book that is trying to blame America's debt on one thing. But it's not just one thing that has put us so much debt. It is many things, and Ms. Boss doesn't go into this. As another reviews stated it just like a talk show segment."
4,A must read for solid information!,"From mini-vans to 500-foot yachts, Americans are obsessed with keeping up with the Joneses.Starting with her next-door neighbor and traveling all the way to the nation's capital, author Shira Boss explores why Americans are no longer saving, how credit cards have become the replacement for the ""emergency fund,"" and where we are headed from here.Green with Envy: Why Keeping Up with the Joneses is Keeping Us in Debt is not your typical book on personal finance. Boss's perfect mix of real-life stories and statistical facts offers a shocking, entirely new and life-altering perspective on how and why we are consistently living beyond our means--a book too fascinating to put down.For anyone who has ever wondered how their sister/neighbor/friend could afford that house/car/vacation, this book is a MUST READ.Armchair Interviews says: You'll never look at Paris Hilton the same way again."
3,"I don't own this, but ignore the other reviewer!","This product does NOT claim to hold 120 gallons. It says it is EQUIVALENT PERFORMANCE to a 120 gallon tank (without a precharge). That is a common practice way of referencing a precharge tank to a non-charged tank. What they are saying is that by using a smaller tank (vol x) with precharge, you'll get the same output as a much larger tank (vol x+). Precharged tanks are a good way to reduce footprint, while still getting the drawdown volume you want at a given pressure range."
4,A good product,"It is much smaller than the tank it replaced,but works just as well.Very happy with this purchase.I would give a big thumbs up."
1,This tanks specs are a physical impossibility,The internal volume of this tank is nothing close to 120 gallons.
3,Amazon does not have the correct tracklisting,"This japanese release does not have ""Down in the Hole"" or ""Brothers"" on it. I'm somewhat annoyed by this as I bought this expensive release to get my hands on a studio version of ""Down in the Hole"", which is a Tom Waits cover and the awesome opening theme song to the third season of The Wire. The version of Ave Maria, the bonus track, does not justify the expense of this import versus the domestic release, in my opinion."
2,Don't waste your money,"I purchased this DVD, as I enjoy watching music concerts from home. Sort of like having your own personal concert.The quality of this DVD (music and video) was not what I had hoped. The stage setting was a mere plywood platform, and concert looked like it was held in a high school auditorium. Acoustics were awful. Most of te music featured, I didn't even recognize.Dont' waste your money on this one..."
1,content of dvd,"It would be nice to have a list of songs available for each dvd sold, you do list the songs when you sell music cd's. I would like to know more about a product before I buy it,(what songs are on it,is it live etc.) It is obvious that this dvd is live but not with other dvds .Reviews are nice but they vary from person to person and really don't give you much information."
1,Where have all the parents gone,"Where Have all the Parents GoneBy: M.T. CoffinAll the parents are missing, in the small town in Broxton. All the kids are taking advantage of the adults being gone. Teenagers are exciting the speed limit, and babies crying for their parents. Three friends, Harry, Liz, and Harland find a secret base of aliens. They see that the aliens are taking out the brains of the adults, because the aliens think they have secret information that the alien's parents might find useful. Now three friends try to save the adults. The aliens catch the friends. Will their brains be taken out too?I think this is a very good book and I recommend the book where have all the parents gone to anyone. It has no swearing, inappropriate, or offensive language. It is called a horr book but it really is not.

5,The fourth Ultra Maniac cliff hanger by Wataru Yoshizumi,The Ultra Maniac series by Wataru Yoshizumi is about Nina who just got expelled for the time being from the magic kingdom. After she gets expelled she comes to earth to study abroad and meets a nice girl named Ayu who becomes her best friend. Pick up a volume of Ultra Maniac and LOL as you go along with the crazy stories of Ayu and Nina.
2,Embarrissingly Useless,"Not enough information to be a historical guide for cinematography in the late 1900's (1940-1999), and completely inadequate for modern digital cinema. The tone of the book is just bizarre ... can be paraphrased to ""these darn computers may be useful some day""."
4,Play like Yngwie,"If you like Malmsteen's marching out album, you should get this book. It has the most complete tabs you'll ever find of Malmsteen the only problem with it is that you buy it hopping that you'll end up playing like Yingwie, and of course you don't, unless you practice enough. The only reason I don't give this book 5 stars, is because the frustration one gets, but anyway, if you like Malmsteen, you should get it."
5,"KitchenAid 5-Piece Gadget Set, Blue","I bought the 5-piece set at a JC Penney's when i lived in Florida and paid more than $24.99. This set is great and I'm happy with all the tools. The can opener is the best, no more electric ones for me. The handles are comfortable to hold and you get a good tight grip with out hurting you hands. The ice cream scoop will not bend like so many I have used before. The peeler & whisk are the best i ever used. The scraper is really made for KitchenAid Stand mixer bowls and is quite long so you might want to buy a smaller KitchenAid scraper for regular bowls but this works well. Only tool I did not come with was the grader but they have a bigger set that does."
5,Extraordinary Tell-All Book On How One Widow Overcame Grief,"The author presents an autobiography of how she overcame the loss of her husband when she was just 27-years-old. Hirsch describes in vivid detail the emotions she suffered and how she overcame her debilitating grief through a series of healing processes that resulted in her own spiritual transformation. This tell-all book leaves nothing to the imagination and guides the reader into an unexpected, but welcomed, succession of events that may challenge some religious minds when the author discovers that life does exist after death. A must-have book for the overlooked younger generation of widows or for anyone interested in overcoming grief resulting from the loss of a loved-one."
4,Nice little phone,"I like my phone. Pretty straightforward review! A few more things:* It is possible to have multiple contacts under one listing on the phone book but you have to dig around in the options to make it happen.* Don't buy this phone for the camera, it is a ""fun"" camera only, not a serious one at all* iTunes on the Slvr works fine and I like it! Although it does require an adapter to use your regular headphones that is easy to lose.Strong reception for such a small phone. Beautiful screen. Be sure to lock that keyboard so you don't call france by accident!"
5,"Straighforward, practicle guide to CBT","The book lures you in with a somewhat over-simple promise that appeals to all sorts of disfunctional eaters, that rules can set you free. Actually you have to do some work to apply the ideas, but it's worth it. This book walks you through a cognitive behavioral therapy approach (the standard method eating disorders are attacked by most programs) without too much psycho-babble or psudo-science. It took me a few tried to really want to read it all, because she seems to beat simple points to death, but eventually I realized it was for a reason -- you need to go through the process."
3,Challenging from a good viewpoint,"Very interesting book, that has good challenges and really makes you take a good look at yourself and realize the feeling and thinking behind how you act. And challenges you to change you thought style and viewpoint to make a healthier you."
5,I use it in my classes,Karen Koenig's work is an excellent addition to the Intuitive Eating and Health at Every Size curriculum. I teach a seven-week Intuitive eating course and use lots of her concepts - especially the list of irrational beliefs. A definite read if you are looking to gain a sane perspective on food and your body.
2,Not worth the cash; check it out of your library,"Before I got this book from my library I wondered how anyone could make a full-length manuscript out of an admittedly good idea. Now I know - they can't.""The Rules of 'Normal' Eating"" is an irritatingly unoriginal touchy-feely book for those who've never (and I mean NEVER) had any therapy. If you've had plenty of it you don't need this book, and it won't help you. The only really useful pages with any concrete ideas - the promise of its title - are pages 146-161. Check it out of your library, xerox the pages, and take the book back."
1,save your money for a salad,i think this book is more for undereaters than emotional eaters. it did not tell me how to do with my feelings at all. this book is for people who dread coming to the dinner table which i dont. i love how at the end of the chapter how they want you to explain to your family and friend that you are trying to eat normally if they like it or not but this book does not help you unless you are anorexic.
2,Boring textbook style book,"Reading this book reminded me of being back in high school & being assigned a book I really didn't want to read. It was informative, but the author used no humor, personal stories, or ""real-life"" accounts of people who have problems or still struggle with food/eating. I have read almost all of Geneen Roth's books on eating, & I guess I'm ""spoiled"" now to good reading on this issue. Skip this author & get some of G. Roth's books, especially ""Breaking Free from Emotional/Compulsive Eating""."
5,Food for Thought,"I just received this book and I can't put it down. It has the most reasonable, logical arguments to explain the irrationality of overeating. I find that it contradicts other books I have read;I have followed Weight Watcher's philosophy and Over-eater's Anonymous steps and they treat the person as out-of-control. While this book gives you credit for being rational and sane the whole time, just out of step. I look forward to following the rules and making progress on my goals."
5,Helpful,This book has been a big help. The author Karen Koenig has made it easy to follow.The book has given me inspiration to continue my struggle with my weight issues. I recommend this book too all.
4,Not that big,"After I read the reviews, when I bought this set I was so worried thinking they were too big. But then I received them and was gladly surprised to see that, in fact they are big, but not THAT big, just a standard height. The tools are not very heavy, but of course according to their height and material, they can weigh a little (it depends of the user so much, I would reccommend to more picky customers to go see them in a store before buying them without measuring them). Overall, they are very easy to use and clean. High heat resistance."
2,Not Par for Fourplay,In my humble opinion fewer than half of the tracks offered on this album are worth listening to. It's the last fourplay album I'll buy before listening to it previously.
3,Mimusic,"This was not one of my favorites. Unfortunately, Track 5 ""Let's Make Love"" was my favorite and there was no relevance to the title nor music. It was rather out of place, yet, I am one of their greatest fans and I will remain that. I am in the process of buying the new album...maybe they revamped on this one. I would recommend purchasing ""4"", ""Between the Sheets"" and ""Elixir."" They are fabulous."
4,Marvelous and consistent,"A typically great CD from this magnificent group of virtuosos. Not as funky as I like my jazz, but then Fourplay is not about acid jazz...just great smooth and tasteful pieces. Buy it if you're into Fourplay at all. You won't be disappointed!"
4,It flows and grows on you,"I expect unique supersongs from these guys and I did not get it. But I like it! With the exception of 'Lets Make Love', this CD gets better every time I play it. These guys are the best at what they do. Many, many years ago I sat next to Bob James on an airplane coming back from Jamaica when Reggae was a new sound. He was playing a Reggae cassette tape full volume and pissing off the passengers. He didn't care, he was obsessed with the music! You can feel their obession for new sound!"
1,Not the usual strength of C. Davidson's heroines,"I had a really hard time with this book. Right up front the heroine is depicted as someone who I could have no sympathy with, no respect for, given her affair with Connor's brother. She doesn't even give a really good reason why it happened, and I can't side with a hero who's in love with that shallow of a woman. It makes me question his own likeability.What I usually like about Carolyn Davidson's heroines is that they are plucky, and true to their hearts. They show strength under difficult situations, and this woman here is engaged to one man, and so easily seduced by another. And then she expects her fiance to still want to marry her. Very naive, and immature.I kept waiting for some redeeming quality to surface to at least give me a good reason to like her, but I didn't feel like I found it. I much preferred Davidson's TEXAS LAWMAN; and REDEMPTION novels."
2,fragile,This item is very fragile and it came all twisted and tangled in the box. I wouldnt recommend it. Not worth the money
1,could have been better,"The box itself is really slick - glossy black with nice colourful logo (same kind of package as Stereolab's set and Porcupine Tree's Stars Die set). That's as good as it gets. Opening the box reveals each of the 5 disks in paper sleeves with album cover art - however, the album liner notes are nowhere to be found! Not even compilation notes! So what about the Live cd. Well, I've listened to it once and it really doesn't stand up to the Keys to Ascension material in terms of sound quality and playing performance. Sounds lackluster. Sorry - only reason to buy is if you want these disks in a neat consolidated package."
2,More repackaged stuff,"but if you don't have any of it, sure.. get it & if you do, burn me & everyone else who has the other discs a copy so that we don't have to shell out the $$ for it. I don't think the 4 albums aren't their best work (I thought Magnification was the best of them), but they are accessible. It took me some time & effort to finally get them. Check out CDUNIVERSE--this might be cheaper on their site."
5,really nice,The albums are all remastered and sould great. The live album is killer and I do not think available any other way but in this box set. Really great packaging and presentation.
3,YES music,"It's a set of CD's I already have. I thought it was just a colection of a bunch of different songs & music on CD's. ""I felt mislead."""
3,A Scarlatti of Buddhism,"I read some where that Giuseppe Domenico Scarlatti either wrote 555 sonatas or one sonata 555 times. I sort of feel that way about Alan Wallace's books and articles on Buddhism and science. This book was recommended by a friend with whom I discuss Buddhism and science, but when I read it I didn't find anything new from other Wallace books. This is sort of a left-handed compliment/complaint as his other books which I've read have been pretty good, albeit pretty much the same. Dr. Wallace seems to be one of those academics who early on had success with an idea and just keeps recycling it. Having said all this I'll add that Dr. Wallace is a good popular and technical writer and if you haven't read any of this other books on science and Buddhism, this is as good a way to go as any; but you can also end here."
2,Over-intellectualized analysis,"The important message, that a Buddhist centrist position is that events are just events, and how we interpret them is our choice and our responsibility-----is not even stated clearly at the end of the book, where the author describes the centrist view.There are no practical examples in the book, and it's totally dry."
3,Didn't work for me,"Although I found Babywise and Toddlerwise by the Ezzos very useful, I found this book somewhat difficult to follow. I tried to potty train in a day, but was not successful. I did use the suggestion to reinforce keeping undies dry and clean in addition to rewarding success on the potty. My 2 1/2 year old daughter became so focused on keeping her panties dry that she would hold her urine for hours without going potty. I used a combination of approaches and my daughter was day time potty trained within a few weeks. Overall, I felt most information in the book could be found elsewhere."
3,Change of perspective...,"It was an easy read and not too much different from other potty training advice - except- the concept of praising and focusing on staying dry and clean, which is the goal, not ""going in the toilet."" Helped me change my perspective and focus. Not sure if helped a lot w/ new techniques, although I did like it best out of the few books I read. I do recommend this book to my friends."
4,Good book,I got this book to help me with potty training my daughter and it has a lot of good tips in it I have not got to read all of it yet but so far so good.. I think it will do the trick on helping me helping her to get the hole potty thing..
2,Needs editing,"I felt confused and annoyed when I finished this book. It was poorly written and in need of copy-editing. Transitions from one subject to another were poor or non-existent.The book opened with a couple of stories, obviously designed to impress on the reader what a great method the authors are presents. However, the stories were incomplete, unbelievable, and awkward to read.The main theme in the book is to reward the child for being clean and dry, not for using the potty. That makes sense, and I will try it. However, if I give as many rewards as the book suggests, all she will be doing all day is eating or getting rewards. This is definitely a bribing method.I didn't feel like I could use many of the suggestions that the book gave, and I was frustrated with the reading process.Liz[...]"
2,way too shallow,I had ordered these before from Amazon and loved them but now they have changed and the pan is too shallow unless you are making a 3-4 layer cake. I sure hope they go back to the deeper sides. I'm returning mine for a refund.
1,Kaiser Bakeware cake pan with cutter,These pans are WAY to shallow to hold a regular box of baking material!!We sent our two back for a refund!!
2,Bad for Cakes,"The idea of these pans are great, but the sides are too low to make typical layer cakes."
4,It's a classic!,"You will find a very good book about the misinterpretation of Darwin's texts and ideas. This book is about being a careful reader, too."
2,Don't be looking for the magic...,"I disliked this book even more than I disliked Tamsin, which was,er, a lot. Beagle is a terrific writer insofar as imagination and verve, but this is his second soppy book about cats. Save your money.pat chapin"
4,An Excellent Reference Book,This book contains a tremendous amount of information pertinent to the ocean and things related. It is presented as a number of small chapters with a logical flow and great interest for the reader. This book contains much factual knowledge without getting burdened too much by the technical realm. Everyone who loves the oceans of our world will enjoy this incredible reference book for many years to come.
1,"To ""A Kid's Review""","This book is not even out yet, so there is no way you would know what it is like! Please don't write worthless reviews when you haven't even read the book because it isn't out yet!"
1,Heartland is BORING!,Heartland is sssssssssoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo boring i just couldnt read ANY of it! Thats why i gave it one star thought i should of put none...but oh well
4,Awesome!,"I bought this book when I first saw it in the Borders book store,a few weeks ago. I loved Season of Hope, that was one of my favorties, but they're all really good. I don't think there's one Heartland book that's bad. Anyways A Holiday Memory was one I could read over and over again. Its about when Amy first met Sundance, and about her first join-up. Lou comes back from New York for the Holidays and when Amy finds out shes leaving early she gets really angry with her sister. Amy slacks off a little and isn't exercising Sundance because he was driving her crazy. Something happens to Sundance that will change Amy's whole outlook on her mom's work and where she belongs. This book was great and I recommend it for all of you fans out there who love this series as much as I do!"
4,Cool Dud,Not only was this special man a classic comedian but was also a superb musician. I have several of his albums now and they continue to be favourites for times when I need to just kick back and shed the day to day crud from my head. Dudley is an excellent pianist with a great feel for jazz and contemporary music. Highly recommended for a listen.
1,Piece of Crap!,"I bought this MP3 player for my 4 year old because she absolutely loves anything to do with Bratz. However, we downloaded five or six songs to it and she listened to them twice. After that, the dumb thing would short out and not work. We thought it was just a battery issue, but when we put a new Energizer battery in it, it didn't do any good. Finally, it just stopped working altogether, and it was only two weeks old. Grrrrr! It is going back to the store."
4,Liptunes Rocks,"Okay, I admit that the product documentation was LAME! In this day and age of proprietary file formats for music downloads, I found the best use of this device is to use Windows Media Player to rip songs from CDs and then synch to the Liptunes.An adorable, tiny little thing, it's the perfect way to consolidate tunes for short trips. I bought this for my five year old for a trip, so I hope she shares nicely with me! Love it."
5,Uniquely Gerrold,"I'm a huge fan of the Chtorr series. While this book wasn't as in depth with details, I found it highly enjoyable. The concept is solid and the characters believable. Looking forward to more of the series. David Gerrold is always a great read."
5,Gorgeous colors for green eyed girls,This shadow quad first came out a couple of years ago. no longer in department stores. I am so happy to find it online
4,Enjoyable read,This is a great book for any girls or young women beginning their journey through the complexities of being female. The author discusses generating respect from dressing modestly and protecting one's reputation. Men often translate signals from women much differently than her intentions. This book teaches girls how to remain in control during situations with men by remaining in control of themselves. Carefully thought out reactions work better than knee-jerk reactions.One of my favorite parts of the book was that it emphasizes that single women should be thinking about upgrading themselves for themselves. You should look pretty for yourself and let men reap the benefits of catching a glance. :-)
3,"A ""Fascinating"" Cultural Artifact","This book is invaluable as evidence of a certain mindset that seems quaint in today's world--or at least I would hope so. It begs comparison with ""manhunt manuals"" like ""The Rules"" and John Gray's Mars and Venus series. I received it as a gift from my mother when I was an awkward ""late bloomer"" teen and still find myself remembering some of the invectives. I saw Andelin's book as a dating bible, swallowed her ideas that women needed to appear weaker, less intelligent, and completely submissive to men and as a result my first real relationship (as a freshman in college) turned into a very dysfunctional dynamic that even my mother found appalling.Have times really changed? Hmmm...."
2,Not worth the money,After 3 years the handle was very pitted and the safety lock was just flopping around.Not worth the money.
3,If you like Elvis...,"Than this is good for you. Otherwise, I don't think it's a very practical game. I prefer basic normal monopoly or Shrek monopoly myself."
1,NOTHING BEATS THE ORIGINAL,"Playing an Elvis monopoly game is not as fun as the original. None of the adaptations can really surpass Mediterranean and Baltic Avenue; the power company, and the Go to Jail of the original. This one is obviously geared to Elvis fanatics, but I don't think once it's played two or three times, there's anything fresh about it all. Another merchandise gimmick in the endless Elvis craze.NOT RECOMMENDED."
4,A very pleasant surprise,"Having read a vast number of books on Africa and African hunters, I was looking forward to getting my copy of Jungle Man. I was under the impression that it might be a good story but told in a stilted, ""stiff upper lip"" kind of style. Not so! Pretorious tells his life story in a thoroghly interesting and absorbing way. There is no exaggeration in his writing, yet he manages to convey quite well the experiences of his life time. The photos are pretty ordinary (as per usual for books from that era) and there is no index. But these are minor points. You will fully enjoy reading about his adventures in Old Africa from the age he left home to manage ox wagons to his involvement in some early African films.Well worth reading."
5,Brilliant,"... but barely comprehensible. But this is Druillet, so we let some things slide.Sloane died, and has ben entombed for ten years in a golden sarcophagus. You've already guessed that little stuff like that won't slow him down. His casket is transported, for reasons obscure, and a magical woman appears within his sealed transport. She revives him with a kiss (hint: this isn't a kids' story). He wreaks the usual havoc, and sails off into one setting sun or another.But you weren't reading this for the plot. Druillet's stories are just vehicles for Druillet's are, which is truly fantastic. It lacks some of the frenzied detail of his 70s/80s work, but is incredible nonetheless. His sense of majesty, mysticism, and evil is overwhelming, and pervades every panel. The ""Dark Demon"" is the simplest of the drawings here, technically, but the most evocative.Druillet's work isn't for kids or for tender sensibilities. It is, however, some of the best sequential artwork ever drawn.//wiredweird"
5,Please tell me more Ms. Wu,I loved this story. I hope Emily Wu writes more about her life and what led her to America. This was a beautiful story about how the cultural revolution in China robbed people of there childhoods and destroyed families. I intend to read more from this author.
5,LITTLE RIVER BAND AT IT's BEST,"Great DVD that showcases the talent of LRB. Great selection of songs coupled with outstanding audio and videoThis is a keeper. If you are an LRB fan and want to see them at their peak with original members, this is the one."
2,Good Music...but!,The little River Band is one of my all time favorites. Unfortunately this disc is of low quality sound and even lower quality video. Too bad...great concert content and even my high-end DVD can't overcome the poor quality.
1,Big Disappointment,Some shows are best realized as dinner theater. This one aims that low and then underachieves.
1,This pump is junk,"Save your money and headaches. This pump will cause you nothing but troubles. I bought this pump to replace a failing one and it worked fine for a week. Then that's when the problems began. I couldn't get it to build up enough pressure to shut off so I tried replacing everything but the pump thinking it was fine because it was brand new. After replacing all my suction piping, foot valve, etc. and $1,000 later I called a local plumber to have him bring out a Goulds pump to try. Worked as soon as it was hooked up. Spend the extra money and buy the better pump. It will save you a lot in the long run."
3,"Not a must have knitting book, but worth a look","At first glance this is a terrific book. It features American knitters from all over the country -- very fun to see pictures of some of the designers and learn about them. There are also about 40 designs, some classic and some that are pretty out there. The photography is divine.Unfortunately, this book hasn't stood the test of time well for me. I tend to prefer knitting books that I refer to over and over again. This book lacks the quality of being a good reference for either technique or designing. I doubt that I look at more than once every six months.Bottom line -- if you can find a copy for a good price, a nice second tier addition to a knitting library. But if the budget is tight, there are many equally beautiful and much more useful books on the market."
3,"pretty pictures, not very useful","This book has beautiful pictures. Its emphasis is mainly on knitting artists in America. It tells their stories, and showcases some beautiful work. BUT... it is not a very useful book. I would say that patterns only take up about a quarter of this book. There are some very special patterns, but I would rather take this one out of the library. If you want to pay for inspiration, this is the book for you. If you want to get busy and knit, this is not a necessary purchase."
4,"Great Coffee Table Book, Some nice patterns","This is a nice book--not for beginners, but for those who love to see nice knitting designs, and read about the designers. Excellent bargain right now if you can still get it--full price was a tad steep."
3,beautiful pictures. Very waspy styling.,"From this book you would think that only white Waspy people knit in America. Pictures are absolutely beautiful. There are interesting articles about Meg Swansen, Barbara Walker, but many more important American knitters are left out (like where is Lily Chin?) It is an enjoyable coffee table book, with some worthwhile designs. Wonderful to recieve as a gift, but given a choice between a 2 skeins of Koigu and this book, I'd choose the Koigu."
2,a lame one sided oppinion,"i thought that this book is definately written in the age of ignorance. the idea of a race of people that is so isolated at the time hits home for me. my family is one of the ""MAYLE"" clan, so to speak, and this book was appauling. granted it gave some of the factual events and information but at the same time the author did not give accounts of the people themselves. it was treated as if this was an experiment. he should have gotten ALL of the facts before he wrote. some of the people that the author wrote about are actually native american (cheroke and pittsburg blackfoot). they were neither white or black and never really claimed to be either. as being a mayle myself, this book is a real dishonor to our family and all of our ancestors that delt with the same ignorance."
2,I'm not quite there with this album,"The music is well produced and nice arrangements, but I can't quite see what all the fuss is about. It makes me think of Justin Timberlake doing an adult contemporary singer-songwriter album. The lyrics are a bit trite and the singing reminds me of American Idol style pop with adult contemporary music.Was this guy really a thousand miles from his home when he was writng about being in the arms of a woman? That song's lyrics are to close to being a corny cliche that they almost go into parody of a down and out but sensitive (!) singer-songwriter."
4,Amos Lee by.....................Amos Lee,"Good music, good artist and worth the price...I have to say a set number of words here but other than I would recommend this album to tohers, I'm out of words! Go buy it!"
5,Wow.,"Great record. Amos Lee's acoustic/blues/folk fusion is both refreshing and enjoyable. labelmate Norah Jones shows up to drop some keys on a few tracks, notably in 'colors', which never hurts."
4,you'll wear it out,"The only reason I cannot give this masterpiece 5 full stars is its brevity. The sweetness that is Amos Lee only plays for 35 minutes or so, and trust me, that is not long enough. Most of the tracks provide soulful escapism, and the rest pure enjoyment. If it played a little longer I could retire my other CDs and simply play this one. As it is, buy it and wait for additonal works from Amos. You won't regret it. (Think a bluesier Ray LaMontagne...)"
4,Refreshing and Honest Approach,"Although I have been a customer of Amazon for years now, this is the first CD I purchased strictly based on the reviews of other customers, and to those who gave reviews I just want to say a great big ""Thank You"". This CD became a fast favorite of mine from the very first song. His voice is attractive, and for me it made me want to hear more. This music is uncut...just a musician and his music. Kinda reminds me going to a local club to hear live music and being blown away at the talent. My very favorite song on the CD is ""Arms of a Women"" but I just let the whole CD play...and you will too...pick this one up!!!!"
4,"Soothing, Soulful... 4 stars","This album by Amos Lee is an album that you can just put on to relax to. Lee is a mix of the eclectic nature of folk music and the earthiness of R&B; and classic soul music. Lee fuses these influences well together to release a masterpiece. Using Norah Jones's producers, you can hear the folk instrumentation with acoustic guitars and non-standard percussion.This is a consistent listen...perfect for studying if you're a student stressed out, or if you are in an office at work and need to take a moment just to chill. The production is excellent, just as it was on Norah Jone's COME AWAY WITH ME. My favorite tracks are ""Keep It Loose, Keep It Tight"", ""Seen It All Before', and ""Arms of A Woman"". Great album, 4 stars."
4,Amos Lee,Every time I go on a trip I have to buy a new CD to listen on the plane. I was looking around and I saw this album. I hadn't heard any of his songs before and the only thing I had known about him was that he would be going on tour with Bob Dylan and if Bob Dylan likes you enough to go on tour with him then obviously they have to be great. This CD is truely beautiful. It's so poetic and full of life. I highly recommend this CD to anyone whos a fan of Dylan/Coldplay/Radiohead etc. You'll love it!
5,Amos Lee CD,I ordered this CD after seeing Amos Lee on Austin City Limits. I agree he is the next James Taylor and regret I missed his appearance in Atlanta.
5,sigh...,"I'm in love. There's not much more I can say. The minute I heard Amos Lee's voice on a 30 second Amazon clip, I ordered the CD, and it was the best musical purchase I've made in a LONG time. This CD is ridiculously good. It's James Taylor meets Ben Harper meets the male Norah Jones with a little more soul. Usually when listening to music, people do other things (i.e. check your email, work, read a book, cook dinner, do laundry, sing along, etc.) This CD is NOT background music. It is music that you sit down, tune out everything around you, and just listen to."
3,"A good debut, but not enough cohesion...","I bought this album because I heard ""Arms of a Woman"" on the radio and Lee sounds like Otis Redding, one of my personal faves. The understated quality of this album definitely is refreshing, and Lee has a nice way of changing his voice and the emotions it conveys to match the lyrics of the songs. I especially like ""Arms of a Woman,"" and ""Bottom of a Bottle."" When listened to more than once, the latter holds quite a few entendres and takes on more complexity than the playfulness that the music seems to suggest. Quite artful, in fact. By comparing Lee to so many other artists (Dylan, Redding, etc), reviewers are definitely on track, but it is exactly these comparisons that prevent Lee from finding his own voice. The album is definitely a great debut, but I'm waiting for Lee to find Lee (and he seems to be looking for himself on the cover)."
5,NEW FAVORITE!!!!,"I can not listen to this CD enough, Amos Lee is truly a gifted soul ~ the lyrics, the music make my heart sing. Thank you Amos. Buy this by the baker's dozen, give one to your mom, to your nephew....everyone will cherish it."
2,Mediocre is the new great,"A one note, one groove, idling CD. Even more sonambulant than Snore-a-Jones herself. This is elevator muzak for the Starbucks' crowd. A whispering tranquilizer. For Zimmerman's sake, put on a Dylan album and stay forever young."
4,good for a mellow mood.....,"Ugh! Enough of the Norah Jones comparisons! I feel that the two are similar in that this CD is mostly laid back, mellow songs --like Come Away With Me is. Amos Lee's voice has a soulful, retro feel that makes me think of so many other great male singers all rolled up into one. I can't say that I play this over and over like others say they do---it just isn't one of those CDs for me. It is a fantastic debut. Don't get me wrong. I can't get enough of this guy's voice. But, I just wish that there was maybe 2 more uptempo songs on the CD. I would like to see what he sounds like then. My favorites are Arms of a Woman, Dreamin',Colors,and and Keep It Loose...You should own this. You won't regret it."
4,Beauty In A Wicked World,"This is a beautiful album. Extremely down to earth work that covers the gamut of emotion from sad, to angry, to happy. He's a great songwriter, not to mention an incredible vocalist and guitarist. This album is monumental - I must have if you have never checked out Amos Lee, or you are an amos lee fan already. ENJOY!!"
1,Formulaic easy listening music,"When you hear this for the first time, you'll swear you've heard it before. It's the same sort of stuff that used to play on VH1 or ""adult rock"" stations..Norah Jones, Jack Johnson, etc. If you like that sort of thing, you'll like this, but otherwise if the five-star reviews lead you to believe this is anything innovative or different, you will be disappointed."
5,"Impressive artist, impressive debut","I have not been this excited about a new artist in so long...maybe norah jones, but maybe not....Mr. Lee has released a wonderful debut cd. I read a review of the cd and thought I would give it a try...so glad I did. I cannot stop listening to it. I tried to explain his sound to someone, kind of Bob Dylan, kind of soul, a little country,a little folk, I'm not sure. He is very unique. And what a wonderful songwriter, I don't know his age, he looks young on the cd, which makes this all the more impressive. I expect to hear more great things from him, I look forward to it.Buy this cd, you will not be disappointed."
3,suzuki daughter likes abcs of violin better,"My daughter is studying Suzuki violin, so we got String builder and ABC's of Violin bk 1 to learn to read music. The ABC's is a lot easier because it starts on the 2 top strings like Suzuki does, but the String builder starts on the 2 middle strings--it's confusing for my daughter. It makes more sense to continue with the ABC's of Violin--it's a lot of fun, plus it fits in with Suzuki ideas. We're very happy with our choice.I am a piano teacher myself and realize how important it is to learn to read music. Especially for little violinists who eventually play in school orchestra."
2,"Some great looks, product catalogue feel",Well laid out and some great ideas on how to incorporate color in a minimalist look. Drawback - most of the items are new and there's a helpful list of where to buy them - suggesting this is little more than a catalogue of things for sale. Many of the pictures are STRAIGHT out of the relevant manufacturer's brochure - for example see the Charles sofa by B & B on the classic black floor. You can get all these pictures for free from the relevant companies. Would have been nice to see pieces that looks great but that perhaps aren't available or suggestions of things you can make or adapt yourself to achieve the same look. Overall my feeling was this is a product catalogue sold as a book. I'd suggest looking at it in a bookstore and sending off for the catalogues of the furniture you like.. for free..the text isn't that helpful. Still a beautiful book to look at and it's nice to have everything in one place.
2,Didn't even finish watching,"...which is rare for me. The son who was watching with me (age 13) didn't even complain when I turned it off. Primarily, the movie was just second rate, like a made-for-tv version of Mel Gibson's Lethal Weapon series (which I enjoyed), with a dog added for interest. It was very dated-- made in 1989, it felt almost like 1979 in quality and storyline, which was very predictable. For parents: I didn't think it was entirely appropriate for a middle schooler. (Living arrangements of Jim Belushi's character with girlfriend & a couple of minor bedroom scenes). Mention this only for those conservative/religiously inclined."
4,"Jerry Lee - ""Good"" Dog","I want a Jerry Lee - He's the best pet a girl could have. I can see myself driving a red convertible Mustang with Jerry Lee sitting beside me (no, no, Jimmy, not in the rear)... Even after viewing these movies for many times, they are still delightful. Many thanks to Jim Belushi and Jerry Lee's trainers... Sincerely, Pat"
1,gerry lee,"The service was great, however, the 3rd movie on this disk does not play properly. It keeps stopping and could not be watched."
5,German Shepherds,Any story with shepherds has to be number one. Jim Belushi was a great partner for this dog. Made a great team
5,Excellent,"After some problems the pack finally arrived to me. It is excellent, new and has three movies, the latest one on the back side of the DVD. I have seen the pack and the quality is very good, looks well, sounds great and all options work. I recommend to buy it."
5,K-9 Patrol Pack,The three movies are totally hilarious. To have them packaged together is a big bonus.
5,"New Conditon, arrived in time","New Conditon, arrived in time. Enjoyed watching this old movie. Thought is was one I had not seen before, but it is always good to see it again."
3,Interesting Insight into Aristocractic child rearing,"No, I don't agree with the earlier review. I didn't find this a story about the author as much as a story about what it's like inside the home of an English lord. I see no more straying to personal storytelling than can be found in the books by Stephen Barry about his life as valet to Prince Charles.Is this a rose-colored view of Diana's childhood? Perhaps. I'll allow the author the privilege of her opinion. Afterall, she was closer to the subject than us outsiders and thus may be right. I feel it is worth taking what the author says into consideration."
1,Not worth it,I bought this case a week ago and it's already breaking down on me. The clip on is poorly designed and I can't clip it in anymore. The clear plastic screen opens up freely and not secured. Just a waste of your money.
3,SAD AINT IT MR. HENDERSON,"It is sad when you have to go to such lengths to get your point accross. I guess we are all truly BLESSED to have FREEDOM OF CHOICE. I too agree with many many areas of this book. But I know something greater than you and me is out in this wide wonderful universe. The RELIGION part I totally agree with because every ounce of RELIGION is man MADE. I hope when you read this book that you as I know that ""the higher power"" lives within each of us. And that FREE WILL is an amazing thing!Debbie in Indiana"
5,What do You Really believe?,"God.Com is a refreshing look at religions and where they lead us. It gives the reader a chance to acknowledge the good and perhaps let go of beliefs that are not in the best interest of mankind. Whether one agrees with Dr. Henderson or not, it will evoke thoughtful contemplation. I highly recommend it."
5,What is says and more!,I have had this gun for six months and all i can say is wow!Wow is right!! it is what it says....It s very durable. I have dropped it withou leaving a scratch on it.It is powerful. Very powerful but not the most powerful.It is acurate. This gun is acurate enough to hit a quater from 25feet if you have the precision.If you buy this gun make sure you:dont drop it multiple times on hard surfaces.dont use cheap bbs because it will cause it to jamdont shoot yourself in the foot with it from point blank range (dont ask)The battery is hard to find at first but it is right under the barrel and a metal rod keeps it carrier in place so dont try to force it open. This gun is worth well over what it is listed at I find it to be worth the money. It will last a lifetime.
4,Don't complain about the price,"Anybody that complains about the price should not be looking at this gun solely for the fact that this gun is meant for real airsofters; people who take the sport seriously. If you want a ""toy"" that looks cool and shoots stuff, go look for a CYMA piece of ****. They'll run you $10 to $30. Any decent AEG costs roughly the same amount as this gun so if this is out of your price range, then you are obviously in the wrong market.The CA G36C is a good weapon though."
4,Ventshade 92514 Window Visor for 2004 Mustang,"At first it seemed that it didn't fit, because it extends beyond the door frame. Now that it's applied it seems fine. Since it's summertime, it hasn't been tested by the rain yet, so I'm looking forward to that!"
5,NO se recupera la juventud..PERO SI LA FRESCURA Y LA BELLEZA,"Yo llevo el método de este libro cada trimestre, porque para el puesto de Relaciones Públicas que ocupo, necesito VERME LO MEJOR POSIBLE...Tengo 29 años, pero desde que practico cada tres meses LO QUE ESTE LIBRO INDICA, TODO MUNDO ME CALCULA 21!Y no falta el o la curiosa que me pregunten si me he hecho cirugía plástica ! Pues no:Solamente el método de este libroY el método es sencillos: SON CUIDADOS PROFUNDOS POR SIETE DÍAS.. Y ni siquiera quitan mucho tiempo!No importa qué edad tengas...inténtalo y verás que resultados tan fuera de lo común !"
2,Selena's Revenge,"I did not like the first book in the series, Portia, and this book is even worse. Weak story line, poor plot development and under developed characters. I would not recommend this book."
1,Piece of crap!,"The clip that holds the top of the Treo sits right on top of the SD card slot. When you pull back the clip to release the phone, the SD card springs out!"
4,Snow Falling on Cedars Book Review,"On San Piedro Island a man gets murdered and a Japanese American, Kaubo Miyimoto another fisherman, is accused. During the trial, people remember and remind others of what happen during World War II. How the Japanese got sent off and how it caused so much chaos. A man will get his heart broken because of a love affair that should not have been and two unpaid payment will cost people their land. The will haunt the people who were in it for the rest of their lives.This book is very beautifully written and I would definitely recommend it. The book was very interesting to me because it is written from several different views. Also the characters are fun but yet mysterious. Although this is a great book it can sometimes move very slowly and become a bit boring at times. I thought that David Guterson wrote this book very beautiful and if you are all about literature you would really like this book."
2,Very poorly written,"This novel had no style and very little substance. From its ""It was a dark and stormy night beginning"" to its too-straightforward account of the trial, it did not capture my imagination."
3,Very Interesting Book,I throughly enjoyed reading this book. Makes me sad to think what some families had to go through. Can see both sides of the story though.
4,"slow moving, but VERY good","I read this book for history class and it was really good. It took a long time to get into it, and sometimes to keep interested. It was a litte confusing in that it was built up as a courtroom mystery, but really I didn't care all that much about the murder case. The detailed descriptions were very beautiful, and I felt like I was THERE, but there was a little too much of them, and it made the book too long. I think the best part was the flashbacks to the characters' past, and the love story between Ishmael and Hatsue was sweet. I was dissapointed by the ending because I was much more expecting something to happen between them than in the case. If you have enough patience and attention I would really recommend this book."
2,"Unless you have to read it, leave it on the bookshelf",I was bored out of my mind reading this book. I thought it was slow paced and the vocabulary gave me many difficulties. It didn't like the content of the book. The storyline made me very confused and the flashbacks were also hard to understand. I would not recommend reading this book. To me it is aimed at the adult audience.
4,Work of Literary Merit for College Student,"Snow Falling On Cedars was chosen by my junior college as this semesters work of literary merit. At first I was not encouraged too much because court room scenes don't interest me. But as I got into the book, I realized it was so much more, there is something for everyone in this book. I am excited about the movie coming out, and I truly hope they stick to the original intent of the story. The one theme that appealed to me was the different love stories, and how none of them were typical fairy tale loves. If anyone that has read this book would like to comment to me personally on this subject it would be greatly appreaciated. Of course along with this book being the assigned reading for the english department, an essay is also expected. So like I said, if anyone is willing to share with me their insights about this book, they can email me at malachite32@hotmail.com, thankyou, and for everyone else, go out and buy this book, you will not regret it!!!"
4,"It is a wonderful novel, if it is read to the end.","The book is exceptionally well written. It is a gripping reality of what Americans put the Japanese American people through during, and even after, World War II. At the same time it tells of a forbidden romance between two people of different race, and of a trial that holds a Japanese American man accused of murder. If you are planning on reading this, read it through to the very end. It does have a few uninteresting points, but as soon as you reach about half way through the book it gets really good."
1,Infinite detail like snowfall covering lack of plot,"I agree with the other readers who gave this one star. There is a total lack of cohesion to the story; many trivial things are put in for no reason at all. Great writers thrill their readers by making amazingly complex threads tie together at the end, this book fizzles into nothing. Great writers make you care about or at least understand the characters, these characters are two-dimensional and uninteresting.If you think this sounds like great writing, maybe you'll like the book:""Well, thought Ishmael, bending over his typewriter, his fingertips poised just above the keys: the palpitations of Kabuo Miyamoto's heart were unknowable finally."" Unknowable finally? What? Why is there a colon in the middle of this sentence?"
3,It was a shift from a love triangle and a murder mystery,The book didn't seem to to be theat good untill the middle of the book but after I got to the middle the book seemed to be very compelling and interesting to read. The auther was able to really describe this book to the every last detail and that was great. The pages seemed to just fly bye and not stop untill the end of this book. The action in the court room was very descriptave for all readers to undersand the situation that the characters were going threw at all times. Also the detail of the murder was great with alot of detail that even the investigators missed. It kept me reading.

4,"This book is a eye catcher, a very good novel.","This book is spine tingling novel. This book is mainly about how a Japanese American goes through a serious turnpoint in his life. The Japanese American, Kabuo Miyamoto, is charged for the murder of a local fisherman. While I was reading this book, I got more into it than I thought I would. I couldn't put this book down. When I thought I could put it down there was another piece of a puzzle that I wanted to solve. This book will have you at the edge of your seat. I also like how it turn out to be a love story during the book. If you are looking for a book that you will not be able to put down or you are looking for a good mystery then you should really go and get this book you'll be satsified when you read it."
5,Aweinspiring,Damn you for beinging so good. At one time I felt I might be a good enough wordsmith to pound out something that people would enjoy. Not anymore. You are so good that I am embarrassed at my feeble attempts. (no spell check) I have been payed but now feel should return the money. Not enough stars to qualify for this writer. Don t listen to the nit-pickers. Damn you for being so good.
3,Good Story with Rough Edges,"This is an entertaining book. The narrative vehicle--courtroom scene with flashbacks--is trite, but it works. Guterson is a gifted, yet unpolished writer. The book reads like a lawyer's first novel. Describing a court room attorney as ""prescient"" hardly creates a visual image. In contrast, Guterson buries the reader in heavy-handed snow metaphors. So too the thematic shifts based on place --the town vs. the sea vs. the strawberry fields vs. the woods --- are too often disjointed and contrived. Ironicallly, the book has been struck from some high school reading lists because of the sex scenes. Ironic because a high schooler skimming the novel for soft porn will be disappointed by Guterson's postively unerotic descriptions. This may be one of the few books that is better as a movie."
2,Snow Falling Off a Cliff,"I liked the great amount of detail Guterson went into with this novel. However, it was getting to the point where I wish he would have gotten on with the story. It was just way too long for the point he was trying to get across about this small bigoted town in Washington in the 1950's. I think that he should have gone into more detail regarding the conclusion than everything else in the novel. When I got to the end, I was like, ""this is it?!"" I read 400+ pages for this!!?"
2,Boring,"Although the writing is beautiful and one can picture the landscape perfectly, I thought that Snow Falling on Cedars was pretty boring and quite predictable. I often enjoy courtroom drama, but nothing really happened in this whole story."
3,Read Snow Falling on Cedars,"Snow Falling on Cedars is an excellent book, that takes place some time after ww2. A japanese man is accused of murder. This book deals with many political and racist issues that have always been contreversal and still are today. This is a neat book filled with great description and flowery language."
5,Snow Falling On Cedars taught me a ton about prejudiceness.,"I was recently assigned to read a novel of my choice. When I first recieved the assignment, I thought that it would just eb another boring language arts project. Little did I know that when reading this novel, it taught me a lot about life in general. When Kabou was arrested mostly because of his race, it showed me that people can be so heartless, when someone is to blame."
2,"Slow moving, bad charactor deveopment","The plot had some nice ideas, but to much irelevent information (which I wouldent have minded if it had been intrusting). there was also a compleat failear to devolp the ideas into an intrusting story. The language is good, but a touch pedantic, and that is no reason to read the book. i would not recomend it."
1,"Sexist's, Prejudiced Viewpoint Against Asian Women","I started reading this book, recommended by my acqauintance who thought I would definitely like this book because I am a Japanese-American woman. On the contrary, I could not stand his sexist's, prejudiced viewpoint againt Asian women and could not finish reading this book. Whenever Hatsue appears in the scene, it is about SEX; as if her only role in the book is to provide SEX. This becomes even more insulting when the book's disguice is a serious, historically-based, well-planned detective. I simply hope that this Gusterson's book will not reinforce some shallow men's conviction that Asian women are ""easy."""
4,I could feel the snow,"This story is about strawberry farmers, salmon fishermen and Japanese-Americans in the Northwest during the time of World War II. A salmon fisherman is found dead with his boat and the locals suspect as murderer a Japanese-American who has motive for the killing. As that man is taken to trial, we learn of the deep history between him and the deceased.I liked that the writer was able to paint such vivid pictures in my head as I read this book. Nicely entertaining with a captivating mystery. Good, compelling story that kept my interest until the very end."
1,LIke paint drying,"Mind numbingly boring, thin plot and no apparent beginning or ending. Nice cover art, but other than that....a waste of time. The little mistakes ruined this book. Mulberries grow on trees, not hedges. There was never a ""redirect"" during the questioning in the trial...not even during closing arguments. Finally Lutherans do NOT pray for a deceased person's soul. They beleive the soul goes where it is going at the time of death and one cannot pray TO or FOR a soul. One of the major points made by Martin Luther at the time of the Reformation and this was actually a huge issue in the era that this book took place. Author needed to do alot more research."
4,"Audiobook's voice actor can't pronounce ""Ole""?","I read this book 10 yrs ago and liked it a great deal, and recently listened to the audio version on a trip. I almost couldn't get through it when the voice actor kept mispronouncing the name of of a fairly pivotal character. ""Ole"" is pronounced ""oh-lee"" for anyone close to a scandahoovian background. Each time the actor said ""ol"" instead of ""Ole"", I wanted to smack somebody. Loved the story, compelling, interesting, and very well written. C'mon man....get the actor and editor to check pronunciation of names and places before you finish the audiobook."
2,Snow Falling on Cedars,"Snow Falling on Cedars is a compelling novel about prejudice, heartache, and absession. it deals with a ten year old romance of Ishmael Chambers and Hatsue Miyamoto. While Ishmael is still in love with Hatsue, she is trying to deal with her husband, Kabuo, being on trial for murder. The trial takes place in the 1950's, right after World War 2. There is a lot of prejudice feeling going around about the whole trial. I thought the author did an excellent job describing scenes in the story but couldn't keep me captivated in the begining of the story. i had to wait till the very end of the story to discover why they even thought Kabuo Miyamoto commited the murder. I wouldn't recommended this book unless you wanted to devote a whole lot of thought into it."
4,More than a man's guilt.........,"It all begins on September 16, 1954. A local fisherman, Carl Heine Jr., is found tangled in his fishing net, dead. The suspect? A Japanese fisherman, Kabuo Miyamoto. What is clear is that there is more beneath the surface than one man's guilt. Greed, prejudice and lost love lie deep at the heart of the island, San Piedro.Throughout the book we are twisted and turned through the trial of Kabuo and flashbacks of past loves and old grudges. We are placed in a place of glistening snow and spring time strawberries that cover the mountainside by the words of the books talented writer, David Guterson. This is a wonderfully written book that opens the wounds of the Japanese-American exile and secrets of the heart."
5,One of the best books I have read!,"I loved this book! It was a tad long,but, it was also completely gratifying. The poetry of this story was remarkable! This is one of my three fave books. Here are some books to check out: 1) Girl,Interrupted 2)Ella Enchanted 3) Snow Falling On Cedars This book was a little hard to understand but great. I am soon to be publishing my book. If you would like to know what it is about e-mail me."
3,"Lush imagery, slight plot","David Guterson's ""Snow Falling on Cedars"" is a novel about memory and its ability to stifle the individual. As such, the novel brims with lush images of the American northwest. This is the book's great virtue, but its plot concerning the death of a fisherman is almost inconsequential. I could care less about who killed Carl Heine. Yet, the novel engages because it is a story beautifully told. Ultimately, Guterson's book proves to be an enjoyable read."
3,A giant in the world of popular fiction......,"I decided to read this book because it had generated so much controversy. It was however one of the best pop-fiction I have come across in a very long time. I looked upon it as a love story, not only between Hatsue & Ishmael, but because all the characters reach out to the reader thru various kinds of love. But the beauty of this book lies in the lengthy, well observed, fine-tuned descriptions of nature in this small island. You can sense nature, taste the berries, smell the cedars...it is just spectacular. The story line as banal as it is (distrust, prejudice,bigotry which we encounter every day) is not what makes this work so compelling...what achieves this, comes from the fortitude of most of the characters and their inner beauty."
4,"Wonderful, evocative writing","I'd highly recommend this book. It is more evocative of scene than most others I've read, and the plot kept me engaged throughout."
3,"Okay, but not my favorite","Snow Falling on Cedars is a good book other than having too much description. The war description seemed to be pretty good. When the Japanese had to leave their home before they could make the last few payments for the land was interesting how it got twisted around. I liked the historical events that were mixed into the story without you even noticing. The sex scenes were a little more than I wanted to know. Overall, it was an okay book. But it wasn't one of my favorites."
2,Could it be any more boring?,"At first glance of the cover of Snow Falling on Cedars one would not expect a love story, but this is exactly what the book is, a love story. Although the books' cover claims it to be a mysterious trial of a man named Kabuo, that is just a small part of the story. Instead, the story is really about Ishmael and his love for Kabuo's wife. Snow Falling on Cedars is a very well written book, but tends to be too descriptive. If you are looking for a fast pace book with a lot of twists and mysterious characters, Snow Falling on Cedars is NOT the book for you."
2,Enough hype already!,"This book is better than the hordes of single-girl -in-Mahattan short story collections and boring memoirs clogging the current literary scene; hence the two stars. But standing alone, it barely deserves that. Guterson's writing is hypnotic, but the pace is slow, his descriptions occasionally laughable, and the love story simply bored me to tears. In addition to being boring, it was also more than slightly offensive--the Ishmael character's heavy-breathing fascination with an ""exotic"" Asian woman deserves a critique all its own. The plot also seems to take the easy way out, giving the ending an unsatisfying (and frankly unbelievable) tone. As for being politically correct, this book jumps from issue to issue faster than those old 21 Jump Street episodes. Guterson does do an excellent job of evoking place--but he doesn't do justice to the folks who live there."
1,A disappointing read!,I didn't recognize this book as the same one who received the glowing reviews and literary awards. I felt it was painfully slow moving. I finished it but did not enjoy the experience.
2,Oh dear,"Crumbs, all these people writing reviews about how good this book is. I've obviously missed something. I bought it on specific, unprompted recommendation. I'm not a half-wit and I read it during a long 2-day Canadian train journey, so I wasn't far off, geographically speaking.It's . . . , well, it's just . . . so, so.And it's obviously a 'set book' in colleges. Good for that, I suppose. Quite a high word quotient. Good value for money. Maybe the train was to blame (or even me)."
2,Bleh,"Guterson gets some points for basic competence in words and some sense of order to the plot. He loses points for what he failed to do, which was make me care about Hatsue or Ishmael or whether or not Kabuo killed the guy. He succeeded in reducing male/female relationships to their sexual practices, and over describing that which need no description. The book celebrated the mundane by being mundane itself. Unfortunately it will linger in English class for the next few years for no other reason than it touches on American Concentration camps for the Japaneese, that is until another even more tragic, over-worded tome replaces it."
3,"Good story, not so good story telling.","It was a good story, but it could have been told as well (or better) in half the space. I got really bored reading about every single plant on someone's farm, or the names of every person in a room and what they did for a living... pointless details that didn't really enhance anything. It took me just over a day to read, but it seemed like much longer. It's frustrating to get bored with a book while at the same time being caught up in the story. I wanted to find out what happened, but slogging through the mud to get there was a chore."
3,A So-so read,"This book just moved along so slowly. I had to finish it to find out who ""dunnit"", but I had little sympathy for the main characters and I found the sets of coincidences at the end, so pat and so formulistic, it really was pathetic, even though I suppose the point of it may have been that coincidences do happen and should be investigated. I found the constant use of the word ""cedars"" really annoying. Okay, there were cedar trees there. So what? Wouldn't really bother with it. There's far better literature out there."
3,nothing generic here,"Much of what has been said about the verbosity of the author is true. However, I was pleased with his commentary on human nature and the attention he pays to smells."
1,"blah, blah, blah",I was draw to this book because it is set near where I live. The descriptions were long winded. I found myself skimming through most of them. I only finished it because I wanted to find out who-done-it. The end. END
2,too slow paced,"Tried this one because I like John Grisham, Robert Goddard, etc. This books starts off real well, but is too slow paced overall. I stopped reading it after about 100 pages in a passage with an endless description of the romance between 2 teenagers... Thought this book was better..."
1,don't read this book,"This is a poorly written, unimaginative book. Under no circumstances should you read it."
2,Great Writing But Dirty Story,"This engaging story has some terrific writing and spendid characterization. But it also has several pages of explicit sexual content and several pages of incredibly strong language. This isn't what I expected. If you want a nice, clean romantic story with some suspense thrown in, this isn't it. Be warned. There is some gritty content here."
3,Asian woman as a perrenial sex object?,"""Cedars"" is a lovely book, which reveals the side of American history not yet widely known; e.g., the internment of Japanese Americans during WW II, Alien Land Law and the internment's devastating effects on the Japanese in US at the time. However, as a novel, this book is predicated on the white male protagonist's search for an Asian woman whose racial difference is the prime motive for his sexual obsession. Although it is comforting to see this obsession help to bring forth positive consequence for Asian Americans in this book, the obsession and melancholy the male hero goes through in his fateful relationship with an Asian heroine are problematic sentiments in the eyes of a person from contemporary US society wherein various ethnic and racial differences become reduced to sexual innuendoes (especially in regard to Asian women). This sexualization of race has dangerous implications in a society saturated by hierarchies of race, class, and sex."
4,A modern masterpiece that leaves one's heart shaken,"Kabuo Miyamoto, a hero from the WWII battlefields, is accused of murder in a place where generation of Japanese and whites have lived in tensile harmony until Pearl Harbor when everything fell apart...As the trials begin, a story of courage, of love, and of hatred unfolds as cedars become enshrouded in the pure drape of San Pedro snow.A haunting tale questioning truth and its meaning to the men and women who were made victims by a terrible contagion called war, Guterson touches the human heart chambers through a poignant vibe of love and hate, of vengeance and forgiveness, and of sins and redemption.Despite the hasty ending and a seeminly Hollywood ""White boy saves Asian girl"" formula, Snow Falling on Cedars refocuses on war from a whole new perception and brings us to gape at the unfathomable mirage of hatred that is deeply rooted in every soul."
2,Disappointing,This book was very disappointing. I was looking forward to reading it and finished even though it was very boring; I kept expecting it to get better because it has received such rave reviews and the Pen/Faulkner award. It was just plain boring
3,Surprising,"Anticipating another tedious court-room effort, this novel surprised me. The warmth with which the characters are contructed in the credible community setting sets it apart from the mainstream"
5,I have recommended this book to many people.,"I was not going to bother to write this review until I saw some of the negative comments that had been written. I disagree with every negative review. I found the book to be excellent; well worth reading. The comment about ""knowing that the defendant was innocent"" misses the point of the book. It's not a cheap murder mystery where the only fun is trying to guess who the murderer is"
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed with Guterson's novel, after so many had recommended it. Overwritten (he uses the word ""miasma"" twice in two pages!!) and only mildly interesting, I found that I read it more out of duty than pleasure"
4,Terrific scenic descriptions!,"I totally enjoyed this book. I could really see the snow storm raging outside, and feel the cold. Mr. Guterson really knows how to describe a snowstorm! This is a terrific book, and I am looking forward to seeing the movie when it's released after the first of the year. I think it will be my first movie of the new millennium!"
3,What's All The Hype?,"This book started out excruciatingly slow. But as it went on the relationships of the characters began to intensify making the book go by faster. While the characters and their relationships are interesting, the plot is not. Its your typical murder trial (with absolutely no rules of evidence) with a typical Hollywood outcome. It had its moments but overall not all that impressive."
4,Good book with a few shortcomings,"This was a book assigned for me to read in English class. The cover is not too appealling but the immediate jump into the plot was a bit interesting. The characters are simple and easy to understand. Unlike other authors, Guterson is a little blunt with symbolism. But, that does not matter too much in the scheme of things because the unique storyline is always there for entertainment. The one downside are the graphic sex scenes. I do not really think they are necessary to the novel at all. And in saying this, if you are the reader just skip over them, you are not missing anything. Aside from these superflous details the book is pretty solid and extremely easy reading."
3,a great book - if a bit overrated,"I read 'Snow' because it is so often touted as ""life changing"" and, and appears on numerous lists of ""banned books"". Well, I didn't find anything ""life changing"" about it. And for all that, couldn't find a single scene within for which it might be suggested a book be banned. Was it banned because he told the TRUTH? I do admire him for that. Nobody else had spoke up before Guterson on the shameful treatment of Japanese Americans during the war. Was it banned for a heartwarming little moment of tenderness between two young people inside a tree-trunk? Who knows...Well, I did really enjoy it in spite of the fact that I really don't care much for historical fiction. The author keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way through, and even keeps you guessing about the guilt or innocence of the man accused of murder until the very end. Another book well worth reading, even if it didn't ""change my life."" Cheers! (and happy reading!) ~ Gus"
2,snow falling on cedars,"Unfortunately, this book reads more like a screenplay than a novel. Other than the romantic scenes in the book, the author gives the reader little intimacy with the characters in the book and does more descriptive writing than absorbing character creation. Since the author did have wonderful plot and storyline, it was disappointing that it was written with little reward for the reader. There was a lack of consistency regarding the view of how the plot and underlying prejudice of society was to be portrayed. If the author would have created the story from one character's perspective, it may have been a better read."
3,An okay read,"I read this book after hearing about the movie coming out with the same title. I connected with the characters, and this connection carried me through the several slow moving parts of the story. The descriptive writing was a little too much for my taste, but it served it's purpose well in several scenes, mainly where the characters were actively involved with each other. All in all, I was a little dissapointed, but also entertained."
2,Snow Falling on Cedars,"I was disappointed with this book. The plot is weak, the characters are weak and the ending is disappointing. I believe the first half of the book could have been deleted, or at least summarized, and saved a lot of trees! A true waste of paper. However, I must admit there was one point where it peaked my interest (just past the half-way point) but then let me down again. Let's hope for something better next time!"
3,An interesting examination of the human soul,"Compelling and hard to summarize, this book struck me most for its amazing organization and its beautiful prose. Set on a fictitious Island, this book examines post WWII prejudice against Japanese Americans, covers a murder trial, and examines love and passion. The only fault I had with it is that at some times the descriptions of the things going on in the book struck me as a bit perverse."
4,"Suspense, love, murder....","""Snow Falling on Cedars"" written by David Guterson deals with the murder trial of Kabuo Miyamoto, a Japanese-American who was accused of murdering his childhood friend and fellow fisherman, Carl Heine. Watching the trial intently, was Ishmael Chambers, who owns the local newspaper, as well as Kabuo's wife, Hatsue. Throughout the trial, there were flashed back of family histories and how their lives were interconnected in the small community in San Piedro, Washington.I am not a huge fan of courtroom drama but this one was able to hold my attention. It starts off slowly but once you get into their stories, it is quite interesting. I like that the characters were written very well and at the end of the day, you feel like you really know them personally. In addition, I also enjoy the bit of history that the author provided regarding the Japanese-American internment during World War II. This is definitely a fascinating read!"
4,Wonderful Book - But Predictable,"This book was very enjoyable to read. I found the beginning a bit slow; but by the middle of the book I found it difficult to put down. When approaching the end of the book, one realizes the predictability of the conclusion, which I found rather dissapointing. It just leaves the reader hanging. What a shame that we don't know how the main character's lives go on. The book could have gone on for another chapter to wrap up the ending. Parts of the book could have been more condensed leaving the ending more elaborate and descriptive. This book is long, but definitely worth reading."
2,overrated! save your $$$.,"Though I found Guterson's descriptions of strawberry fields & island life beautiful, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone because some parts of it were very boring. The description of the WWII battlefield sounded forced & out of place. Will definitely not be reading any more of the author's novels."
2,Was he paid by the word???,"After reading so many reviews of this book, I could not believe it was the same book I was reading. I found myself skimming the pages for parts that were important to the plot! This book has more words than a old stale dictionary that had been left in the dusty desk of the school that was to be torn down when the snow is melted and the leaves on the trees have started to bud out like the breast of a teenage girl who tried to read this book!!!!!!!! I really tried to like this book more, being from the area. Maybe the movie will be better."
1,I thought this book was boring,This book could have been much better if there weren't so many unecessary characters. That made it very hard to keep each one of them in line with their part in this book. This book could have been hundreds of pages shorter because there was more information that we DIDN'T need than information that we did. I like more exciting books that grab your attention in the first few pages. This book definitely did not do that.
4,Excellent narrative,"When I picked up this book from the shelf of the British Library, it was actually the review on the back cover that caught my attention. It said that if Harper Lee, Arthur Miller and John Grisham were washed ashore a lonely island, they might together come up with something like this! As it was the author's debut novel, I didn't believe it. I thought it was exaggeration.But after reading it, I must say, I'm not at all disappointed. It was great! I liked the courtroom drama very much. Though the flashbacks were a little long and not so appealing, I was touched by Ishmael's character and also that of the accused. I almost had tears in my eyes at some places. No book after Uncle Tom's cabin brought me so close to tears. I loved it. Excellent narrative."
3,"At least it isn't ""Bridges of Madison County""","This book is an entertaining and quick read. It has a predictable, formal structure that feels comfortable. I can't, however, understand why the book is so critically acclaimed. Guterson's metaphors feel clunky and seem tacked on, and though the characters are endearing, they don't quite come alive. However, I can think of a lot of worse books that have become bestsellers.P.S. The sexually explicit passages, though mild, do seem to throw parts of the book out of balance."
3,Too much detail.,Although the story was interesting it took much reading to find it. There were many pages of descriptions that were very detailed.
3,An interesting book,"What I enjoyed most about this novel was Mr. Guterson's facility with descriptive language. I just loved the snow storm--though I also thought he had his characters moving around in it entirely too much--and I liked his casually elegant way of getting into his characters' heads and hearts to explain their histories.So why only 3 stars? Because I was ultimately unconvinced by the book. By that, I mean that he wasn't as successful as he should have been in intertwining the book's themes of war, family, and racism (especially the latter). By the time the book ended, I didn't much care about the outcome. That's why I wasn't bothered by its truncated, too easy ending. The event that facilitates the ending was extremely contrived, and even drawn out too much.Mr. Guterson has some serious talent, though. This book just didn't awe me as much as I thought (based on other reviews) that it would."
2,I guess I need to see the movie,"Seemed like a fine painting out of focus. Beautiful character development and imagery with no spine. It just wound down to nothing. This is an over rated book, but I am excited to see if the author can get it all working together later."
1,Terrible,This was a terrible book. I read it and It was mediocre. i was expecting a surprise ending but it turned out not to be a mystery at all. the imagerie was the only good thing about the book.
4,Guterson's novel a beautiful insightful look at prejudice,"Guterson's novel, Snow Falling On Cedars, is a beautiful if sometimes harsh look at the prejudice and injustice in both American and personal history. It is a story of one man accused of murder, the crime pinned upon him simply, in his belief and in the beliefs of his relatives, that he is Japanese-American during the post World War II period. It is also the story of a young love between a white boy and a Japanese girl that refuses to lie where it has been buried for so many years. Guterson's novel tells the story of four very different people, two Caucasian, two Japanese, and their struggles to cope with a world they did not create but must live in and be resigned to. Although it contains racist dialogue and a small amount of violence, the book is eye-opening and heartwrenching at times, giving the reader a somewhat different, wiser look at the way America was and the way that it perhaps will be for a long time to come."
4,A very well written book,"David Guterson did a great job composing this book. His writing is descriptive and I enjoyed the book a lot (despite the fact that I had to read it for a high school English class). The plot is captivating and the characters are well developed. This book got me interested in the Japanese-American relocation and internment, about which I have recently done a fair bit of research for some papers. The only reservation I have regarding this book is that there are things included that I would prefer not knowing about (the rather ""intimate"" scenes in the book, for example). For those who, like me, might be bothered by those unnecessary parts I would like to precaution that they are there. Without these parts I would say the book was very good and for those who have no qualms about such things I would recommend it."
2,Distant novel,The books reads like the snow falling on cedars...slow and cold. The plot drifts and seems very detached. Didn't like it very much. I liked the attention to detail and the novel approach to race relations.
3,"I had to read it for class, and my teacher is dumb","I read this book for my class, and I have to say that it was oK. Julie liked it better than me, but she's a nerd-o and reads books more. I read Catcher in the Rye last year, and that's truley an aawesome book, like the way he's a rebel and stuff. Don't read anything by Julian Simon cuz its no good."
2,Strawberry Fields Forever and ever and ever,"This novel skims over the surface of a lyrical world without ever descending into passion or conviction. I cannot recall the last novel I read where the characters are rendered with such glum and humorless earnestness. The novel's sympathy for its characters is admirable but by the end, they're all just cardboard cutouts in Guterson's wordy morality play."
1,The title should give it away,"Snow falling on cedars - how boring is that? And so is the book. Trees trees, trees. I think he has a fetish with trees.It was incredibly painful to get through but I wanted to find out what happens in the end - NOTHING! That has to be the worse ending of anything I have ever read or watched.I now know to see if any of the 5 star reviewers for this book have rated anything else I look at."
3,A lot like the movie,"""Snow Falling on Cedars"" is not a bad book, but it is also not a good book. If you have seen the movie, don't bother reading the book--they are basically the same. Both are slow-moving, predictable, and very visual. The movie was aesthetically appealing, and the book also conveys the foggy, mysterious San Piedro island, but that's about it. Guterson's language is ephemereal, but, frankly, he takes too long to say things. Don't get me wrong--I like long, drawn out novels, but this just gets boring. However, there are high points, as well as low, and I would be lying if I said that I didn't get some enjoyment from reading this book, but it definitely isn't the most compelling book out there. I won't discourage anyone from reading this, but check it out from the library before buying your own copy."
4,You'll have to read it yourself,This book was one of the more interesting books that I have read the whole love problem wath Hatsue and Ishmale was very interesting and confusing but all around a great love side story and the trial and the timing of the trial was just perfict durring WW2 and the evidence against him and the small place it was Just set the mood for the whole book with that love story on the side it was very hard to keep straight but it was good exspecaly at the end. I thought the book at first was bad but it eventually got me and I hate to read so it has to be good.
2,I thought that the book was boring.,"The novel ""Snow Falling on Cedars"" is a boring book that I would not recommend it to anyone. The love story between Ishmael and Hatsue was just about the only thing that interested me. It was the only thing that motivated me to keep on reading. I was curious to what would happen between them. This book only got two stars though because it just had too much boring information in it. It gave so much useless information on each page that I almost fall asleep on every page I read."
4,A great book to read in the winter,"I liked the book, it seemed to draw you into it. I found myself reading it late into the night and not wanting to put it down. I found it very interesting how the writer move the reader from past to present as he did. He seemed to mold your thoughts and emotions as if he predicted how you would feel when you read lines in the book. The weather in the story really controlled my thoughts also, as the lines in the book did, I really think that this book is a book for almost anyone."
2,A let down,"After the glowing reviews I had received from others, I must say that I was a bit let down with this book. Granted, I wasn't expecting an action-adventure novel, but I did expect to become engrossed with the plot. Throughout the whole novel, I was waiting for the plot twist that never came. I found the book to be predictable, both in its story line and its message. Also, I wasn't able to connect with any of the characters, nor did I have any opinion either way on the verdict of the trial. Maybe I rushed through the book or maybe I'm too used to the trash-adventure novel, but I didn't think that this book was all I was led on to believe."
2,What Happened to the Plot?,Darned interesting story line. The problem is that the exciting climax takes only three pages at the very end of the book. The rest of the book is spent setting up the mood with vivid poetic imagery. The author spends hundreds of pages setting up the story and three pages finishing it. It's almost like falling off a cliff when you get to the end of the book.
2,Mockingbird Clone!,"This book, while combining a masterful account of the Northwest in the mid 1950's, Is merely a pitiful attempt to repluck the heart strings that had been strummed by 'To Kill a Mockingbird'. At best, this novel shows while the duplication of great works is possible, recreation is beyond reach."
3,KUDOS GUTTERSON- You have HOPE!,"i want to start off congradulating Gutterson on a well written and intresting story. I give it a 6 because it might not be as polished as other bestsellers but he has prospect. He did have an excess of detail in some scenes. I lot of instanmacy that could cut the book back by 100 pages. An intresting twist but we don't care about the love afair, only the trial."
3,A MOST UNUSUAL SETTING AND PLOT,"""Snow Falling on Cedars"" has an interesting plot about a fisherman, Carl Heine, who is found dead among his fishing nets. The setting is on an island north of Puget Sound in the year 1954. Accused of the murder is a Japanese-American, Kabuo Miyamoto, because of a dispute over farm land. The book has well-developed characters, particularly that of Hatsue, Kabuo's wife, and Ishmael Chambers, the local newspaper reporter. However, where the book does fall short is in the overabundant descriptions of the fishing industry, particularly at the beginning of the book, and the fishing community as a whole. The movie definitely told the story in a more graceful flowing, colourful and descriptive manner than the book. However, what does make the book a worthwhile read is the plot, itself, the intriguing characters, the strong emotions, racial tensions, and the pain from the aftermath of the second World War. Combine those ingredients together and you have an interesting book."
4,"A good, solid rewarding read","Yes, there are some slow parts and some rough spots. But nowadays if the book isn't stupid or deathly boring or just plain silly we're all extremely grateful to the author. Snow Falling On Cedars turns out to be a pretty good read with fresh realistic characters, a pleasant prose style, and a nice blend of message and theme and drama. I plugged away at the slow stuff and took my time around the best stuff. Realistic, surprising, and satisfying--it may not be the best book I've read lately but I'll say this: It was worth the twelve bucks, I'm glad I purchased it rather than going to the library. A keeper."
5,gets to the heart of personal vs. national identity,"The manner in which the author deals with the aftermath of WW2 and the treatment of Japanese-americans was inspiring. Prejudices on either side lead to misunderstandings, and lost innocence. This novel stirs the emotions and causes the reader to get angry at the injustices.The end seems to drop off suddenly; wrapped up neatly in a few final paragraphs, but otherwise an excellent story."
2,A matter of region,"It is interesting to find that most of the negative comments come from New Yorkers. Should that mean that New Yorkers actually have a more acute critical mind? For sure, it seems that they are more of the down-to-earth and skeptical type. Good book or not, Snow Falling on Cedars gave way to a great, unique film. Credits need be given to the author and praise needs be awarded to the film producer."
1,Book Not Published for USA Market,"I would not have purchased this particular edition of Snow Falling on Cedars if I had known it was published for the European market. I gave the book to an American 13 year old who is still learning rules for grammar and punctuation. Although the story is the same, the punctuation reflects the rules of Oxford English therefore, I had to tell her to ignore the punctuation so she would not pick it up and use it in her own American classroom essays. It is a learning experience, of course, but a needless one at this point."
3,Average Book for a Bored Person,"Overall, this book was not as bad as I had heard, but it definiately was not one of the best books I have ever read before. Some scenes are described in great detail which were slightly disturbing andthe beginning was so incredibly slow. The basic plot was average, I have definately read better. If you're a hopeless romantic then it wasn't too bad, but in my opinion, most people would find this boring if it was for pleasure. I had no choice because I had to read this for my English class."
3,Not for the action-seeking escape reader,"In this meandering courtroom drama, a murder case serves as the background for the interwoven fates of the inhabitants of a small island off the Northwestern shore of the U.S. The book is really a collection of stories about the relationships between Americans of European descent (for lack of a better term) and 1st and 2nd generation Japanese immigrants.If you are looking for a fast-paced thriller or an action-packed murder mystery, this is not the book for you. The author places his words slowly but deliberately, gently and indefatigably, like, well, snow falling on cedars.I give this book three instead of four stars because I was disappointed by the ending, which came about a little too easy, and because of the unnecessarily explicit sex scenes."
4,Content enriched.,The ending seemed a little rushed but the content and character descriptions made up for the short comings.
3,Slow in the beginning but worth forging ahead...,This book begins very slowly but is definitely worth reading
3,"Predictable and forced, but it kept me reading","My teacher assigned this book as part of our required summer reading (re: She's crazy). While this book does have its moments, most of it seemed to forced, like the author was trying to impress us with his knowledge of Japanese words and, oftentimes stupid, similies and metaphors. There aren't any good characters in here either. Every single one has some sort of glaring personality defect that just makes you get annoyed with them (re: Hatsue is a b***). Plus, what happened with the ending?! Predictable, cliche, hollywood come to mind. For all the hype my teacher gave this book (granted, she IS crazy) I thought it was mediocre at best."
2,HOLLYWOOD,"Overall the book is OK I guess. Not a complete waste of time. It is suspenseful, but the ending made me sick. It was so predictable that Ishmael would turn over the evidence that I was sure no great writer would ever have that happen. It would have been far more depressing, but far more realistic to have Ishmael just toss the evidence into the water. It was like the writer was in a hurry to finish up this book and send it off to Hollywood to make a film. The 'feel good' ending is sometimes the worst."
1,Disappointing,"From the reviews given in The New York Times and other places, I had rather 'Greater Expectations' of this book than were warranted, as I discovered about halfway through. I finished the book, but was by the end of it deeply disappointed (not to mention crashingly bored and half-asleep from the plot). The author's so-called knack for realistic descriptions I found lacking, as was any real sense of how to write a story.Guterson does, however, excel at repetitive illustration, managing to describe one thing or event in a half-dozen or more ways -- in a single paragraph. While the sounds of his sentences are often entrancing, like so much modern poetry it is a lyricism without meaning -- beautiful words in a beautiful nothing.And if D. Guterson's style is 'terse' and 'brilliantly compact', I shudder to think what adjectives may be applied to Henry James'!"
3,Meh,"Bought as a gift for a friend, average book average read.. so so novel for those that like this sort of story."
3,"Almost palpable tone and mood, but story plods on and on","Although Guterson's much praised novel sets up a tone and a mood like few contemporary novels do, the story often takes tangential diversions and therefore seems all the more underwhelming in the end. Furthermore, the ""whodunit"" aspect loses its steam and the true revelations about the murder of Carl Heine leave much to be desired. ""Snow Falling on Cedars"" is a beautful example of evoking a distinct mood in narrative fiction, yet the often lugubrious and sonorous pace of the novel becomes the novel's primary hindrance."
3,good premise but overrated,"Does anyone else feel that Snow Falling on Cedars is a tad overrated? Although it is award-winning and a bestseller, I sometimes felt that the metaphors and symbolism aspects were too put-together and sometimes cheesy, and the descriptions, character dialogue, and themes were very redundant. I was impressed with what seemed like a vast amount of understanding on Guterson's part and the way he integrated past with present. The story was always interesting and Cedars has all of the elements of a capativating novel: courtroom trial, history, love, etc. I enjoyed this book, but it could have been trimmed down at least one hundred pages just by removing all of the repetitive parts. This book seems to paralell somewhat to Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird, but I reccomend Mockingbird over Cedars for anyone who wants to read a book about racial unjustice in a judicial setting. Overall, this was a good book about an important issues of the US."
3,"expertly written, though a laborious reading","Normally I love to read the book rather than seeing the movie. It is usually more in-depth and more enjoyable, but in this case I would like to make an exception. Go see the movie, you will save yourself a lot of time working through the zig-zag of overlapping flash-back/present scenes. The writer's research was superb and conscientious, and I was looking forward to reading this book, but it felt more like a task keeping track of the tangle of details sometimes...."
4,Rate it on it's owm merit,"The novel is a modern day classic. It is written in uncommon prose for our times. Evaluate it as if no other book existed that is the true test. Long: Sometimes. Predictable: Sometimes as well. Yet, moving and desciptive like you will seldom find among a new release. Narrow in the description of the Japanese during WWII, yes it is but, remember this book is a murder mystery first, Love story second NOT a historical novel. Wait until the movie hype dies down....read it on it's own."
4,Snow Falling On Cedars,"This book is beautifully written. The discription is exceptional. The characters are so well developed through the discription that you feel you know them and are pulled into the novel experancing everything with them. Guterson demonstrates as a practical memorable author. After reading this book I don't think the mystery will ever leave my mind. This book is a scrutiny of racisim, forgivness, and love between people. The symbolism that Guterson uses is incredable. He uses fog to demonstrate mystery and he lets your mind imagine what is going to happen from the beginng of the story."
3,See the movie!,"I agree with the previous reviewer! The book had too much detail, I think, and kept backtracking with the histories of each character's grandparents! Although someof the childhood memories were interesting, the story could have been much shorter. Although this hardly happens, I would recommend seeing the movie!"
3,redundant redundant,"This book was an interesting story and a pretty good courtroom drama. Nothing was as excellent as the hype was for this bestseller, but Guterson showed a respectable knowledge for what he wrote about and an interesting portrayl of the times before, during,and after WWII. Gutterson illustrated each point by paraphrasing it throughout a paragraph, and that became irritating after awhile. The book had a good story but was too repetitive, and I did not feel totally satissfied once I finished."
2,Second half of the book did not stand upo to the first half.,"Guterson's imagery is superb throughout the book but the drama of the court room fell short when the wife failed to tell what she knew and the japanese fisherman refusing to talk. That was lame and in need of some form of ""deus ex machina"" and not the predictable newsman coming up with the solution that somehow evaded the sheriff. But I am on to ""East of Mountains"" to see if a seamless plot is possible for Guterson."
3,Scissors please...,"Guterson's short story collection was outstanding. Evocative and emotional, like listening to an old time storyteller with an eye on the modern. This book's sense of history and character is just as good, but the crime was so far removed from the characters and their lives as to leave me thinking...""so what"" at the climax. Take the characters and their experiences in the 30's and 40's, weave a few short stories around them and I'd have been happy."
4,The book was...,"I think the book was pretty good. It was thought provoking and deep...but it wasn't profounding to the point where I had a cartharsis. I really enjoyed reading it..and the way the characters were slowly developed. I've read through a few of the comments placed here and they said that the characters were not well developed...well I think Ishmael, Carl, and maybe even Hatsue were quite remarkable characters. I'm proud of Ishmael..and his mother playing a great part in his life (even though it was the ending half of the book). However, I do agree that the book was slow...and parts where I fell asleep. But that was what made the book beautiful; the way he described the setting and was descriptive of little parts of nature that never really seems to awaken any of us. And I think there might have been some symbolism in parts of his writing. Nonetheless..I think this book was wonderful to read. I enjoyed it very much!"
4,A Good Read... but too much of a Who Dunnit...,"This novel is a combination of murder mystery, courtroom drama, historical perspective on racism in post World War II america and a love story all at the same time. It is a wonderful non-linear novel in that it takes its reader back and forth in time effortlessly and smoothly. Its drawback is that in pursuing so many different but yet related angles to the same story, it seems to wind up as a ""Who Dunnit"" book which neatly wraps up when the murder is solved."
5,Very Good Book,"This is an excellent book and such a wonderful tragic love story. I think anybody who reads it would end up enjoying it. I do think, however, that it might be a tough read and some individuals might give up on the book too soon. So I suggest that all who is interested in reading the book do so, but do not give up on the book if you feel it is a tough read because the story is wonderful."
3,Snow Falling on Cedars,"In this novel, Gutterson takes us through an intricate story by way of a murder trial along with frequent flashbacks and explanations. The story pieces together, slowly but surely, to reveal an interesting mix of romance, racism, war, and relationships among people. Though Gutterson tends to be tedious and wordy at times, giving the reader in some cases too much detail, he manages to get across a thought-provoking story with much meaning behind it. All in all, I think Gutterson incorporated great ideas and examples of realistic human relationships into his novel. Its only downfall is the extent of its detail."
5,A Powerful Novel David Guterson is our modern day Steinbeck,"I read Snow for a book report in my English class. Read half way thru then saw the movie. It is powerful stuff. The theme of racism and prejudice,fear, love and hate are well developed in characters so full of life they seem to be real people. The love story is especially touching. Ismael and Hatsue and their forbidden love affair. But also Ismael's war experience, the Japanese suffrage and the murder trial that spands through the novel. It's a romance, a mystery and a powerful novel of human trials. I recommend the book. And the snow falling is poetic."
3,"it was ok, it was ok","I read this book about two years ago, and I thought it was interesting but not great. It's been two years and the thing that really stuck with me was that whenever someone spoke they would repeat themselves!! The story was good enough to keep me reading, but that just bugged me all the way through, all the way through! Did anyone else notice that?"
4,"Enjoyed it, but had a concern","I was looking for SOMETHING to read, and saw the movie previews for Snow Falling on Cedars. Thought, what the heck. The previews look good. And actually, I enjoyed the book. We get rich characters and scenery. I felt like heading down to the docks after reading some of the fishing scenes. The main character did something I found annoying (can't reveal it -- that might spoil the book) but the main character doesn't have to be infallible. My one concern was the author's inexplicable preoccupation with the male sex organ, specifically, in mentioning it several times when it was unneccessary. For that reason, and the descriptions of sex, I wouldn't recommend this book for teens."
2,Shallow and Gratuitous,"This novel is bloated, callow and meandering -- without purpose or effect. It certainly doesn't work as a murder mystery! It's shallow melodrama about distinctly unpleasant people. Generous dollops of gratuitous sex and violence. (The sex scenes, actually, are queasily embarrassing to read, because they are so inappropriate and out of place.) When I was done I felt that I'd just read a self-important Danielle Steele novel.I do agree with the other readers who liked the cover. Very pretty."
3,"OK, but somewhat disappointing","I was very excited to read this book because everyone said that it was great, and I was excited that it was being made into a movie. I found the beginning to be very slow; by the middle, I almost couldn't put it down, and I thought it would continue like that through the end. However, I found the end to be very predictable and disappointing. None of the characters were very well developed, and it would have been better if the focus of the book was on the characters and not the descriptions of the snow and fishing boats. The end definitely left me hanging and unsatisfied."
2,Disappointed,"I read this book because everyone else said they loved it. The book was very difficult to get through, the first part moved so slowly. I kept reading on, hoping I would develop an iota of sympathy for this guy, but never really did. Hopefully in the movie version, Ethan Hawke will be able to portray the character with the depth that was lacking in the book."
2,"well-written, thoughtful, horribly sexual","The suspense of the trial was masterfully drawn out. People should read this book beacuse of its good plot and accurate history. Why the need for such explicit scences between people whose love and relationships did not even figure into the plot. Carl ans Susan Marie had quite a very steamy time in this book. If you aren't prepared for detailed sexual images, don't read it. However, if you don't mind this sort of thing, the book is redeemed by its Romeo-and-Juliet romace and an intriguing mystery."
3,It was an ok book,"This book was ok, but it got way to detailed on things that we really didn't need to know to an extent. At one point it had like a whole chapter on japenese ancestery."
3,Promising writing squandered on weak plot,"Kudos to Mr. Guterson for seducing everyone I know with this thin plot. The writing is certainly adequate -- both locations and characters are well fleshed out -- but the plot fizzles down the stretch. Guterson cannot decide if he is writing a serious mystery or social commentary, thereby fulfilling neither of those goals. I was left with the feeling that either path might have created a stellar novel but in splitting the difference he created a merely average one."
3,ok,a good read but not as good as the reviews. does a good job of putting the Japenese internment in perspective. Good job of depicting the legal system in small towns.
4,Just O.K.,"The writing was pretty good, but the plot wasn't superb or anything. I'm giving this an 8 instead of a 6 because he made Puget Sound seem like the most heavenly place on earth."
3,This book is good for people with differnt cases,I think the book was confusing and some of the book was interesting on the murder of Carl Heine. I think a lot of people is going to read this book. You got to write a lot of names in notes so that the story won't be so confusing. There is a lot of times that the book goes back to the past and some goes to the courtroom. The story is at San Peidro Island and judge feilding is the precider over Kabao. The defendants attorney is Nels Gudmunsson. The other lawyer is Art Moran. This takes place around fall and winter. Ismael had a fling with Hatsue but they broke up. Ismael is a reporter for a local paper. I hope the next person be like Ismael.
3,This book was a murder and a love story,I really didn't think this book was all that great.It drag forever. It really didn't start picking up till the end. But my feelings for the book change at the end and thats when I really was getting into it. It was really interesting with the whole love story and how things turned out with that abd the trail situation. The trail was very interesting and well put. Although I thought the book was challenging it was worth reading if you get into those kindof things.
3,A little bit of a letdown...,"I guess my anticipation was too great.....this was a well written book, yes, but a little too difficult for me to plow through. Wonderful descriptions of island life, the war period, farming and fishing but the story itself plodded along. Matter of fact, I had the Fraser on during the final chapter and kept tuning myself to the television. For people who enjoyed this book, I would suggest a book called Captain Corelli's Mandolin by Louis De Berniers. A love story from a Greek island during the war. If you liked Snow Falling on Cedars, you'll love this!!"
2,"Weak in some areas, strong in others.","As a winner of the Pen/Faulkner Award, I expected more. The book's most entertaining aspect was the snow storm. The author did a good job making me see and feel it. Ishmael's mother's kitchen seemed especially cozy in the storm.On the negative side, I wasn't riveted by the plot. There was enough interest to keep me occasionally picking up this book until I finally finished it after several months, but I could never get excited or passionate over what was happening. The author didn't fill the characters with pulsing red blood, not for me anyway.The book was also too wordy in places, especially in the first half."
3,good story but very disappointing,"When I first found out that I was going to read this novel for my college english course, I was excited because I knew that it had won many awards and was sure to be a good book. Boy, was I wrong. It had a good story line and an interesting plot, but it did not need half of what Guterson put in. The novel could have done without the graphic sex scenes and the the back grounds on Carl's wife and many other unimportant characters. I knew from the begining that Kabuo was innocent. Guterson presented too much evidence that could convict him and not an equal amount of evidence that could get him off. Overall, I was very upset about this novel. I did not see anything that great about it"
3,Book is rather tedious but has some shining themes.,"The text of the story is rather slow going for the most part and is cluttered or junked with not so compelling dialogue. The thematic content, i.e., racism and the perversion of American justice is strong and convincing and the reader can be movedby the writing through this channel. Guterson makes a fine attempt here but there is no real feeling evocable for the characters, just for theirplights.Recommended reading for those interested in a fictionalized account of Asian American discrimination during the Second World War and anyonewho wants to read a good crime novel of the trial genre."
2,NBC Movie of the Week,"This is how this book felt to me. The characters were shallow and the narrator was intrusive and sappy. I didn't know what this book was about before I opened it; but, coincidently, I started reading it immediately after finishing ""The Brothers Karamazov"", which has many of the same plot elements. This made it pale in coparison to great literature even further. Living in Japan, as well, made the stereotypes seemed all the more laughable to me."
2,"Don't read ""Snow Falling On Cedars""","Snow Falling On Cedars by David Guterman is arguably a staple of American literature. I disagree. Set on an island to the north of Puget Sound in Washington, Snow Falling On Cedars is a story of a murder trial of a man of Japanese descent. A story of racism, with examples that persist to this day, some would argue. In reality, it is a novel with little to no believability. Guterman's characters are shallow, and aren't developed throughout the book. Ishmael Chambers, a newspaper editor, is one of these. While supposedly driven by love in Snow Falling On Cedars, he is also a war veteran and yet as evidenced in the final chapters the sense of duty the Armed Forces drive into you is nonexistent. Admittedly, Guterman's story of racism in Washington has merits, including showing the awful effects of racism and the flaws of our judicial system, but these merits do not outweigh the sheer perversity and unbelievability of this novel."
1,Yawns falling on Cedars,"This book had some promise in the beginning but then the writing gradually became more awkward, the characters less believable. The courtroom scenes had all the emotional tension of softly chewed gum. Character development -- just didn't happen. For those who loved this book -- congratulations for mastering probably the most challeging piece of literature you have ever read."
2,Trying too hard,"I had high hopes for this book when I picked it up, and although I enjoyed it somewhat, I was in the end disappointed. The author seemed to be trying too hard to convey too many messages (but none effectively). He deals with prejudice, post-war societal wounds, forbidden love, and murder. It seems that all these things must fall into place with some sort of deep meaning, but they never do. If you pick it up, you'll probably finish reading it just to find out what happens in the murder trial, but that's really not enough to save this novel."
2,Overated and disappointing for Puget Sounders,The only convincing parts of this yarn are about fishing.Guterson knows nothing of Japanese growers on the Sound. The letter from the Jpanese mother is as unrealistic as the description of the lack of supervision of Japanese american girls. Too politically correct to be meaningful.
2,Snow Falling on Cedars,"It was an alright book, but the author seemed to go off and talk about things that had nothing to do with the plot line, therefore losing my attention."
4,Good,Good! it was one of the first book of our book club it as an excellent choice because the story is unpredictable
3,"slow moving, yet quality writing and content.","It takes place in a most interesting area, which I have studied and visited. The period time is of interest especially the handling and interaction of the traditional national U S migrants and the more recent t Japanese, even before the war."
4,Great Read!,"This is wonderful story and well written. The writing was a bit slow in some areas, but the overall story held me and captured critical historical facts."
5,Snow Falling on Cedars,I liked the WWII history brought into the storyline. The descriptions and details interest the reader as well as the scenes switching from past to present.
1,Yuck,"Ok I know all of you ""older"" folk are going to be saying, ""those dumb kids wouldn't know a good book if it smacked them in the face!"" Personally I think this book royally bit!! I was forced to read it and make stupid and totally irrelvent comparisons between the book and some corny themes!! I feel this is a 406 page novel about absolutley nothing!! Guterson drags you threw this love sick triangle of obsession, heart break, and sex. Lets just say Guterson has got some serious issues!! I am also extremly disappointed with the ending you make me read all that and then when guterson makes me think things are getting good they start to suck again! I think this is one of those books that when you finish reading it you say ""WHO CARES!!!"""
2,Very slow moving,"Usually, if I don't like a book, I will stop reading after only a few chapters. I read more than half of this book before I had to call it quits. I kept hoping that I would find the suspense and plot twists that I expected which never materialized. I fast forwarded to the ending which was disappointing and glad I hadn't plodded along to the end. Well, on to Grisham's latest!"
4,Love with in a Trial,"Snow Falling on Cedars is one of the best novels I've ever read: romance, mystery, forgiveness, betrayal, and fighting. Guterson is a very talented writer. You can imagine everything so perfectly. I especially loved how he writes the ending. He gives the story a little twist. He puts the fate of the defendant's life on his wife's first love. This is definitely a book, that every page you turn you're in for a new surprise. I recommend this to readers who love to be challenged. You have to follow this book closely to see how every little detail ties in together. I enjoyed being challenged when reading this book, and i hope you will, too."
4,My Heart Hurts,"I had not heard ANYTHING about this book. I thjink, from reading the reviews ot\f the dissappointed readers, that ignorance is the key to an enjoyable experience here. Sad, poignant slice of history. Actually, it is the faces, minds and hearts behind the bland , impersonal sentences that chronicle history. I read it on vacation abroad and was reminded of so many of the reasons I love, loathe and ultimately embrace my beloved America. Don't be deterred by the dissappointed readers, nor worked into a frenzy of high expectation by the hype. Read it because this is a very good story with very human characters who move inexorably toward the conclusion that. despite its grand sadnesses and failings, Life is for the living, and there is nothing to do but persevere."
2,P.C. hype leaves everything to be desired...,"I had ""heard"" that the book was an excellent must read. I was disappointed not only by the slowness of the story itself, but by the redundancy of the text. He has many descriptions which I felt were goobledegook attempting to hide a weak story. The book could easily have been 100 pages with nothing lost. Guterson seemed detached from his characters, a writer merely describing thoughts, feeling, emotions etc. which made me feel detached from the characters, as well as the story. It's interesting to see how one good review can often times illicit an emperor's new clothes mentality. There are so many excellent books out there, this is not one I would have spent valuable time reading had I read an accurate review. I finished it because I had high hopes it would improve based on inaccurate word of mouth and reviews."
3,A+ for the descriptions of nature; C for plot development,"The author's descriptions of nature are beautiful and some of the best I've ever read. His character development of Hatsue is also excellent. The plot, and development of Ishmael are another story. I found myself very short on sympathy for the main character by the end of the book, and I didn't find the solving of the mystery very realistic, either. I don't think a sheriff could miss so many details or loose ends as this one did, even back in the 1950's. Overall, I guess I was a bit disappointed with this book. The cover and title held great promise, but the author didn't quite deliver."
2,good writing from a mediocre writer,"Difficult to get into. Clear, fully formed characters. Well constructed plot. However, somehow it all falls flat. It left me longing for three books that easily surpass this one on three levels: The Perfect Storm: on the topic of life and death at sea; Serpentine: fulfilling the page-turning murder mystery catagory, and A Prayer for Owen Meany: for SUPERIOR construction of historical plot and character strength."
3,disapointing..,"i was aware of the hype surrounding this book, and prepared myself for a novel that would linger in my mind afterward. I was confronted with a few extremely dull chapters, which eventually warmed to a poetic love/mystery story. I did however find that the first chapters had taken away the sensationlism of the rest. I also felt that the ending was not developed enough. We learnt of the trial throughout the novel, yet in a chapter and a half it was over, and the convicted was found innocent. It was much too fairytale style, and not at all sensitive like the remainder of the book. A slight disapointment for such a built up novel."
4,"Slow at first, but becomes quite engrossing","Had to read the book for school was very slow in developing, but after a number of chapters, passions in the novel become evident and the novel finishes quickly. I thought on it for a long time afterwards"
3,Memorable - Evokes the period and the people beautifully,"I found this book to be a rich evocation of the period and people of the area where it takes place and would recommend it to anyone with an interest in a compelling drama that has a positive ending. The experience of the Japanese immigrants and their families was particularly poignant, as was the description of the work of the local fishermen.I would not characterize the book as one of the best ever written, however, primarily because of the way it ended. The racism of the case was described well throughout the book but I couldn't quite believe the way that racism was used to resolve the story, particularly the actions/inactions of the defendant. The sort of ""feel good"" ending that resulted was not nearly as delicately done as the rest of the story, which is why I give it 3 stars."
2,To be continued?,"I have just finished reading this interesting novel, due in part to the fact that it is going to be made into a movie that looks stunning. The book Mr. Guterson has written is brilliant in its ability to recreate the Pacific Northwest in the mind of the reader. The story moves along and tries to show the aspects of the human heart. The flaw lies at the novel's end. It just stops. I was truly disappointed when I was left there with Ishmael. You wonder what is going to happen with him and Hatsue. How does the town react? What about Kabauo's dream? Does it come true? Though long, the ending is truly a disappointment and the novel could easily go on for another fifty pages."
1,Don't believe the hype.,"I picked up this book because I heard all the hoopla. But it was terrible -- and alarming that the breed of American novelists that confuse ""subtle"" with ""saying nothing"" is growing. I'd rather be thrown into that goddamn strawberry patch and die a agonizing death than have to pick up that book again!"
2,A very dull book,"Quite why this book has been talked about so much is beyond me.It has to rate amongst the most dull books I've read this year. If a book is going to be this tedious I expect to get some payoff in terms of learning something about humanity but sadly this is not the case.The formula seems to consist of an basic, unintriging detective story which could be told in about 10 pages broken up with page after page of dreary character description. This would be OK if you could care less about any of the characters but you can't. They all seem so mundane. Why do I need to know about the in's and out's and then some of the police deputies reaction to a seeing a corpse. It's not like the author has any real insight into it anyway.I came away with the feeling that the author was trying so hard to be thought of as serious that he just comes up as pretentious. Yes he can write but I question the importance (and definately the interest) of what he has to say."
1,A Terrible Book,"It might be my fault, but this is one of two books in my lifetime that I failed to finish. I found the first 100 pages or so very tedious and the characters such caricatures that I could not force myself to go on."
5,A quiet book with propelling force.,"Snow Falling on Cedars was a gentle book written with astrong hand, a hand that could control each word so thatthe grim seem unthinkable. My 'favorite' scene was thecamp. Guterson bluntly showed the living conditions,the reader feeling the humiliation of the characters."
5,A well written thriller is both riveting and literature,"Snow falling on Cedars will appeal both to the Grisham reader, looking for a courtroom thriler andto the more ""refined"" reader, concerned with good prose, character construction and story evolution.A special treat for anyone that has lived in the pacific northwest, it presents a deep thread oflove, prejudice and friendship that reveals a great deal about human nature at its best."
3,A nice weekend novel,"I wouldn't go so far as to say that this was a great novel, although it wasn't bad. I will say that if you are looking for high action and suspense, this might not be what you're looking for. On the other hand, it's the thing if you're looking for a little relaxation. The prose is beautiful and *very* detailed - the author seems very interested in making sure the reader sees what he is seeing. The atmosphere becomes as important as the story. It's a nice weekend read, but doesn't have enough depth to make it ""great""."
4,Read it more than once to pick up nuances,"The first time through, I enjoyed the style of writing. The second time through, I concentrated on the love story, the racism of the times, the detective scenario. Guterson did a fine job of keeping the reader in suspense, but unfortunately toward the end, he turned quite predictable. The secondary characters all contributed tremendously to the story"
3,Some Beautiful Passages,"This book is worth reading--the imagery is wonderful and the story compelling. However, there is a lot to read through that doesn't seem to have much to do with the plot.The reader is taken on many side trips that detract from the strong story line. There are many characters to keep track of, and this, with the superfluous information can make it feel as if the reader is ""wading"" through the book (too many times, I asked myself ""when is this chapter going to end,"" and ""what does this have to do with the story""?).Still, there is much to be admired in Guterson's writing and the book is worth your time to read and enjoy."
3,desappointing...,"well, i just would like to say that,as a foreign student,this book was understandable,that's why,actually,i added one star... the ending is very desappointing,and for me,the main idea is very good,but as a result i just read a love story that takes place under cedars or with snow through the windows... though,the movie was not that bad,but the novel was still better. as a conclusion,i would advice to the ones who are interested in this story to read it instead of going see the movie...doing both is o.k.,but don't go see the movie without having read the book.by the way,i found the name ""kabuo"" ok,...i didn't get why it had to be ""kazuo"" in the movie..."
2,Snow falling on Cedars - Predictable,"A mystery I think not! Well written, but the story was too predictable. I knew what was going to happen after the first seventy-five pages. Guterson wrote as if he were a poet, great adjectives and verbs, but he forgot to add mystery to the tale. The book read slow because of this, it took me a lot longer than it should have to read four hundred some pages. The only mystery was; what happened to the mystery in the novel? In first chapters, Guterson pulls you in with exquisite vocabulary, then you are dropped like a bad habit by lack of story. Disappointing to read such a great and yet not so great book in one. I did not suggest this book any of my friends, as I will not suggest it to you. Find a better book."
3,Guterson lost his way...,"After a wonderful start and an even better middle, the author seemed either in a rush to finish (which I doubt, given this is a first novel) or he just lost sight of the nature of the book. He finishes as if it were a courtroom drama and nothing more - as if a resolution to the trial is the primary interest. This is a surprising miscalculation, especially given the strong depiction of the various and complex relationships on the island. I finished the book wanting much more on the lives of the characters in the aftermath of the trial and could really have cared less about the outcome of the trial itself (the verdict was obvious way in advance.) Guterson has a real gift for storytelling, but Cedars was ultimately a squandered opportunity."
1,what an awful book-please stop praising it,"I'm all in favor of giving zero stars. Amazon, please could you make this an option. I am not a japanese-american, but i cannot imagine that this book could be thought of as a good recommendation for a history class! None of the characters are developed to any significant degree and i could not interest myself in it enough to even think of reading it again. I'm surprised that i even made it to the end of the book-it was difficult, i assure you."
3,"Fair, at best","Considering all the hype this book generated, I found it disappointing. The narrative holds together well, though the physical descriptions of the island are repetitive. Furthermore, the plot is ultimately unconvincing. Was there no other lot of 7 acres on the whole island for Kabue to farm? Sheesh. The characters even pointed out early on that the land was not that good for farming. Guterson is much less bad a prose stylist than many pop fiction authors - but this book left me saying ""OK. Next?"""
5,A life-altering book,"I was so moved by this book. I had always known what was done to the people of Japanese ancestry during WWII, but this really book really brought home to me what it must have been like for ordinary people. The book also works very well as a murder mystery, with suspense up until the very end. I loved the characters, who seemed like real people with the descriptions of their histories and daily lives. This was the best book I had read since Stones From the River."
5,"Despite the hype and expectations, it deserves the attention","I thought this book was excellent. I consumed it all in two very shortly felt sittings. I also grew up in a small fishing town and I thought that every character and every scene was a masterpiece in authorship. The writer is completely objective, free from ego, and yet every emotion of the characters is wrenchingly felt. I especially liked how he handled the Japanese American characters and their perspectives. There is simply no book out there like it. And in the light of its accolades, it is clear that we are in a time when we can all appreciate this beautifully constructed story."
2,Typical racial law novel,"The book had a common theme. A trial over the murder of a well liked man in a small town with racial prejudices and historical accuracy. Yes. It did teach something, but not something new and thought provoking. I was required to read this book for english, and I have to ask, for what?"
4,I liked the symbolic significance of the book's title.,"I was particularly intrigued by the book's title and significance of its last line: ""...that accident ruled every corner of the universe except the chambers of the human heart."" The ""snow falling on the cedars"" represnts the concept of ""chance"" in the world- relationships, war, accidents etc.. I think this is the view of the world that Guterson is trying to take. It is by chance that the Imadas had to suffer their internment; it is by chance that Carl Heine died and his childhood friend was wrongly accused; it is by chance that the snow storm hit the island and allowed Chambers to find the real cause of the fisherman's death. We see the significance of Ishmael's last name when we see the book in these terms. It is a somewhat pessimistic, unChristian approach, but at the centre is the power and poignancy of human affection.Only the emotion of love is immune from chance; the playing out of love in the world, of course, is not."
4,A strong emotional grip,"I thought this book was just great. I cant describe how tied into this book i was. Guterson has beautiful narrative techniques in this book and has a wonderful way of bringing in the realities of the of the racism, japenese internment camps, WWII and brings in the feelings of all these characters. It really made me feel for the characters and has an emotional grip on anyone that reads it. I think the fact that a high school student like me, enjoyed this book and its literary importance is definatly proof that its a great book. It has a mixture of a mystery, love and graphic images. I suggest this book to anyone and everyone!"
4,Be determined to get into the story and it will reward you.,"I also bought this book because of all the great reviews it's received. It turned out to be very difficult to sink my teeth into -- oftentimes the descriptions go on for pages (something that puts me off, personally). However, the storyline and characters are so engaging that I found myself, by the end, totally engrossed and made myself stay up late into the night to finish it. So if you can put up with some wordy descriptions long enough to care about the people in the story, you will *love* this book! And if you can't, I definitely recommend trying because it really is worth it."
2,Snow Falling on Cedars,"I listened to the audio book. This story somewhat confusing and the narrator's voice was loud, then soft, then loud, then soft. I had a hard time getting into it and I found the end to be dissappointing. Nothing was really solved or summed up. I would not reccommend this tape to a friend."
2,"Tiresome, overrated","After a while I just got bored with the endless and pointless biographies of every character that do nothing but interrupt the flow of the book. The love story was obvious, and after a while I just didn't care about the murder mystery."
3,Interesting Story but a little slow,"This book does draw the reader into the suspect's mindset and lets you view the world through his eyes. It was just too slow--it dragged until about midway through the book where it seemed to pick up and we were finally exploring the mystery behind the ""murder"". I loved the story though--the author really gives you an idea of the social injustice that this culture inflicted on fellow citizens. Also if you are from this area it really gives a good history of this area. ;)"
3,good for starters,"If you're new to knife painting, this might be a good start. Mrs. K gives exact color mixes and lots of diagrams to help make your first attempts at a knife painting positive experiences. The ""Instant"" is perhaps a bit misleading since you will need to take time to arrive at good color mixes, but pretty much everything is spelled out for you here. There is even a section that gives you hints about how to go off on your own and create your own original designs."
2,NOT MADE FOR CHUBBY BABIES!!!!,"I purchased this baby carrier for my 4 month old, 20 pound baby. It was too stuffy and not enought rooM for my baby's belly."
2,My hips suffered ...,"This carrier is very bulky, cumbersome to put on, and uncomfortable for me (5'2"") to wear. I used it as hip carrier to carry my 24 lb son around the block. By the time we got home, I was barely able to walk. My hips were numb and sore. When used as front carrier, it was okay, but it still can't beat Baby Bjorn for comfort. I haven't used it as back carrier, but I'm sure I will have to have other person to help load my son in it, which is not an option for running error to the store. Come to think of it, I think I will return this carrier and get regular hip carrier."
3,Confusing carrier,"Works well once you figure it out, but there are so many other ones out there that aren't as complicated."
3,Blackout,"Published in 1969, this is Aquin's second novel; it was awarded the Governor General's Award in 1969, but Aquin refused this on political grounds. The novel's plot revolves around the murder by a French-Canadian pharmacist of his English-Canadian lover; the story is as a whole generally an analogy of English-French relations at the time."
3,A Good Beginning,Unfortunately there are few poems in this book that deal with her religious beliefs. Those that do are thought- provoking and wonderful. I hope she includes more of them in her next volume.
3,love Mary Karr but not crazy about this book,It was too religious for me - but I will buy and read anything Mary Karr decides to write - she's amazing. If you haven't read the Liar's Club you need to read it immediately!
5,Cutest kid vid ever!,"As a parent, you watch a LOT of crummy kid vid. This one, however, was actually entertaining for the adults as well as the kids. It's science, which is great, and appropriate for ages 5-12 I suppose. My daughter is still singing one of the songs, and my 4 year old wants to play it over and over again, even though it's a bit above his head, so thank goodness it's cute and the music is (believe it or not) really good. Really great."
3,Good draft of a novel,"Characters, story flow, ideas...all make this a fun read. But the repeated, glaring editing problems stick out and taint the experience. It's as if nobody actually read the last proof - there are no less than 50 typos and some other simple errors that you would not expect to see in a major hardcover release. Dietz is a very gifted writer, he just needs someone to proofread before publishing."
4,Excellent Addition to the Series,"I have enjoyed all of the Legion Series so far and this is my favorite of the series. The basis of this novel is the Boxer Rebellion of 1900, which has always been a fascinating subject.The politics of the Confederation and the continuation of the Ramanthian threat was excellent. Continuing with the theme of including Hudathan's in the Legion was very well handled in this story. My favorite character in the book was Captain Seeba-Ka.My only complaint about the book was some of the back stories, the Ramanthian plot was a good addition but the sections on the Syndicate seemed like filler to me.With that said I would recommend this book to anyone who has read the other books in the series."
2,Not so good.,"I was really excited about his collar. I loved the idea of a retractable handle, which would make it easier for me to control my dog when going out for a quick bathroom run. Although the collar appears well-constructed, it started to fray almost immediately. I am constantly trimming away loose threads. Not only is this annoying, it's shoddy workmanship. Very disappointing."
4,"Definitely a collar, not so much a leash.","I bought this for my St Bernard, who was always called ""Beethoven"" from passerby despite being a girl, so we obviously needed a pink collar to help with gender identification.This collar works great as a collar, but the built-in leash is a joke, It doesn't act like a leash, it just stretches a bit when you pull on it, and if you're trying to hold your dog back, its the same as grabbing the collar itself."
2,"Cool idea, but ineffective","I've tried this brand in addition to a few others with the same end result: they quickly wore out and broke.This one last about 3 months before the elastic finally gave out, and it was the most solidly built one that I tried. I really wanted to use this to be able to cart my big dog from the house to his tie out cable without needing to leash him. This was great while it lasted, but it's short lifespan requires a low star rating."
2,Great Idea,"This is a great idea for a collar. I loved it when I first received it. The next day I noticed the collar was starting to fray quite a bit, which continued to get worse. I finally had to throw it out after about a week. I'm not sure if this was a fluke or not. I have an English Mastiff, who is a large lazy dog."
2,"Good idea, but not very robust","My 7 month old dog plays with the neighbor's 75 lb Malmute / wolf puppy and somehow they managed to chew this collar off! This didn't happen with my dog's previous collar, which was a cheap 1 inch collar purchased at Ross's dress for less. It's a good design idea, really helps to control your pet with gentle guiding when a leash isn't handy."
3,"A mess, but often an entertaining one","How often have you seen a film as silly and preposterous as it is entertaining. Here's one. Lithgow plays a mad doctor who involves his sons in a plan to get him kids for his scientific experiments. Though by no means does it go up with the great Hitchcock films, for a film of its kind, this occassionally engrossing and fun mess has enough laughs and to keep you guessing. Lithgow is great as always."
3,Modern version of Psycho,"This is an interesting film brought to us by Brian DePalma. It's obvious that this is his worst film compared to his other masterpieces. I thought that some things in this were ripped off of the movie Psycho - The car in the swamp, man dressed as a woman & the music. It was also put together in a very strange way. There are too many dream sequences that may confuse some. If you want to see a true DePalma film, see Carrie, Blow Out or Carlito's Way."
4,THE MANY FACES OF MR. LITHGOW,"While RAISING CAIN is one of director Brian dePalma's less visual films, it still is a pretty nifty shocker, with an over the top but excellent performance by John Lithgow, who gets to show off his chops by playing multiple roles. Lithgow's father spent his career using children as case studies for multiple personalities and now it seems like he might be back doing the same thing again. Lithgow is perfect husband Carter Nix, who has a loving wife (well done by Lolita Davidovich) and a precious little girl. Steven Bauer (Thief of Hearts) plays Lolita's former love, Jack, whose wife died while witnessing a stolen kiss on her deathbed. Durable Frances Sternhagen shows up as a psychologist who worked with Nix's father and is called in to examine Carter. Despite much of the movie's predictability, DePalma does pull a pretty sharp twist in the climax and another one of his CARRIE shock endings. Not one of DePalma's best, but a sturdy thriller just the same."
2,Didn't Raise Any Cain For Me,John Lithgow is a decent actor who has made good acting roles before but this is a bit of a strech for a man of his talent. In this over the top and viloent film about a pair of twin brothers who will stop at nothing to procure children for their father's scientific experements. Lithgow has all the attentin in a moronic script that is somewhat similar to Hitchcock or even Welles. Laced with blood and Chills this film doesn't add up to much. Best scene was when Lithgow keeps changing his mutiple personalties to hide his guilt.
2,i give this movie 2 stars for the acting of john lithgow but the whole movie is a ZERO,mr. de palama is once again raiding the grave of hitchcock to make yet another slick(or sick if you like) thriller where if you think about the idea for long you can see the whole movie come apart.this is bottom of the barrel film making.
2,Poor Directing...Can not be compared to Hitchcock!,"I don't understand all of these great reviews. This movie was awful. Lithgow doesn't at all seem derranged or scary. There was only one scary part to the whole movie....Terrible, don't waste your time!"
5,A brilliant and overlooked thriller.,"I saw this movie back when it came out.Kind of like a cross between The Crying Game and Psycho.Brilliant acting, a fast paced and interesting script.Good directing.The ending was...........um, creepy.I think the leading guy used to be on Third Rock From the Sun.LOLI get a big kick out of seeing the kind of work he used to do.Why did he ever go into tv?He's way too talented for regular old tv.All in all I think Raising Cain was one of the better psycho thrillers, but most people seem not to have seen it.Pity, I highly recommend this overlooked gem."
3,not really a Bible study book,"I hope I'm not splitting hairs here, but I am used to Kay Arthur's wonderful Bible study books, and this is more like a book that has questions in the back. To me, that needs to be clarified. It is definitely not a workbook."
2,Disappointed: Lacks practical application,"This was my first Kay Arthur book. I am comparing it to the impact Philip Yancey's and Max Lucado's books had on me. I even listened 2-3 times through to make sure I wasn't missing something. I gained no deeper perspective of covenant with God, nor was I able to glean anything from the tapes to make 'practical application' in my life. Most disturbing was her reference to Jesus Christ going to hell after the crucifixion. This is just not true. Christ did not 'descend to Hell' to pay any 'debt' we owed. It was all finished on the cross, thusly He proclaimed, ""Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit!"". Also, the gospel of John records Jesus as saying, ""It is finished"". I cannot recommend this book."
1,Low quality.,Did not last long at all and I did not use it 24/7. I alternate between the day and night bulbs. I do not recommed purchasing this product. The Zoo Med night bulb is excellent and lasts a long time and use it on my box turtle.
1,Must be the worst bulb I have ever purchased.,First I would like to say that I am normally very impressed with my amazon purchases. In this instance I was not. This has to be the lowest quality bulb I have ever purchased. I bought it because the price seemed very attractive and now I know why. I don't know if it was an old dated bulb or simply a poor quality bulb but it was a waste of my money. It worked just long enough not to be able to return it...too bad.
1,Is this a joke?,"This is a joke, right? I received the bulb, and within a few hours after installation, it was broken. The glass bulb had broken off of the metal fixture. I emailed the company 2 times (once via amazon and once directly to the company) to complain and ask for a refund, and I have received two email replies from the Mail Delivery Subsystem saying that my email was being ignored. I literally had to use a potato to remove the remains of the bulb from the socket. I would not recommend purchasing anything from this seller."
1,Worst Lightbulb EVER!,I bought this for my pet turtle and it lasted 5 days. I kept it on for about 12-15 hours a day. So if you do the math it lasted for about 75 hours. I would not recommend buying these bulbs. If you read the product details it says it is guaranteed 1000 hours.
1,Do not buy!,"I ordered these bulbs for my bearded dragon and the bulbs did not last long at all, two only lasted a few nights! I pay more at the store but they last much longer."
3,They burn out after a few weeks,I have gone through three of these because they do not last long. A few weeks or four tops. They do keep my lizard warm though.
1,Worst light bulb ever!,It burned out in an hour. I was using it in a brand new hood on my turtle aquarium. I replaced it with a plain white incandescent and it's fine. So it's not the hood. Don't waste your money on this bulb.
1,These bulbs are not very good.,"These bulbs simply don't last. My first purchase lasted less than 30 days. I contacted Zoo Med directly by phone, and they did state that the bulbs are warranted for 90 days. After I emailed them a copy of my receipt, they did send me a new one, and I figured what are the odds that a 2nd one will go bad THAT quickly.Well, apparently the odds are pretty good, because slightly over a month after Zoo Med sent the replacement, it has burned out also.The actual glowing filaments on them don't burn out, but the stiff wire in the glass tube at the base of the bulb melted apart on each bulb. Odd for the bigger wire to burn, while leaving the filament intact.Even though the company did back up the bulb with a free replacement, I won't be buying any of these again. It isn't worth the hassle to have to call for a replacement every 1 or 2 months, particularly for a bulb that cost as much as these. They should simply make them correctly from the outset."
3,Not his first book,"I have no review for the book, as I haven't read it yet, but I went to high school with David, and this is not his first book. He previously wrote A year of Lesser. Just wanted to let you know."
1,A Rearguard Study of an Avant-Gardist,"Grace Schulman is a poet who pretends to write a critical study of Moore's work; her appeal to critical sources is amateur. The book is most useful where Schulman relies on her own readings, which nonetheless utilize such stodgy methods as counting syllables and stresses almost exclusively. Schulman has been meticulous and has uncovered a few things that could be helpful to readers, but her own logic is watery. This book serves as a good example of mainstream poetics trying to claim that Moore was a poet of the so-called ""conversational"" vein rather than an innovator who played--successfully--with the big boys."
3,One star for every good gadget,"Had this set for three years now. Spatula, peeler, whisk are great. Scoop is average. Grater doesn't get used because the Microplane ones are so much more effective. Can opener is the worst I've had - keeps slipping off the can. The $2 no name model is 10 times better. All hold up real well, which is good for the first four and not for the last two ;) I'd buy the good ones separately if you can get them on sale."
3,Gift purchase,"Purchased this as a Christmas gift. As far as I know, the utensils worked well, I haven't heard anything negative at least!!"
3,The Sea Priestess,"I did not enjoy this book as much as I wanted to, and thought I would. The prose used by the author simply did not make any sense to me for the period for which this book alluded to. Although Ms. Fortune goes into elaborative details about the characters and situations, it simply did not draw me into the characters' world. I would've liked the author to have dwelt into Ms. Le Fay's psyche more profoundly."
3,"Good book, but a slow read",This book is an occult classic. But I will tell you it is not the easiest read and can drag at times. So be patient.
5,Ancient magic mysteries revived,"When estate agent Wilfred Maxwell is recovering from severe asthma his mind opens up to new psychic currents .Then he meets the ageless Vivien Le Fay Morgan and helps her turn an old fort by the sea into a temple.Vivien is a Priestess of Isis from an ancient Moon cult.She initiates Wilfred on the inner planes in her magical rituals.She teaches him the esoteric significance of the magnetic ebb and flow of the moontides.After Vivien mysteriously disappears Wilfred marries the homely Molly.Because ""All women are Isis"", Molly is able to learn the rituals and perform them with Wilfred.The mystic power of the sea is evoked in this novel and pervades the whole story. Some regard this as not only Dion Fortune's best novel, but the best occult novel ever written."
4,"rich in details of the Indian culture, class, cuisine","This book was lush in detail about all aspects of Indian life, class system, and culture. The details of the foods (in all classes of society) were especially valuable in contributing to the feel of the story. The details seemed to wrap themselves in and out of the plot line which was simple in itself. The vastness of culture and class distinction, in relation to the British presence in particular, was really the story being told. My only disappointment was that, as with other Prawer Jhabvala novels, it just seems to end, rather than sum up the conflicts nicely. Probably the whole point - it just keeps going on that way, in both the novel and real life. The characters are very sharply presented and reading this book was a warm, fluid experience - very rich indeed"
1,stupid movie,the story was bad the actors can't act . I couldn't make heads or tails of any of the sry
2,Fslse Advertising,"I got this in a set of four DVDs for one low price, which I couldn't find listed here. This was easily the worst of the four. Containing a flag for ""nudity"" on the back of the DVD case, there was nome to be foud, and is a pretty lame vampire flick. I would not recomend it."
1,The Vampire Conspiracy,"This was the worst movie I have ever seen in my life!!!!!! Dont even go if its a free showing, you will walk out!!!"
2,ok,"The plot was good and the head vamp was pretty cool, but it is a brain damage film and it's cheesy. With a more high budget producer it could be really good. Don't waste money on it, but if you want to see it rent it or borrow it."
5,Great product,Great product. My oldest daughter is now 3 and has had this bear since she was born. She has been sleeping with it ever since. It has been washed several times and the only noticable wear is the nose which my daughter chewed off. I recently had another daughter and decided she should have one too. Product arrived quickly and in great condition.
5,What a great little bear!!!,"I was so pleased with this little bear. When I opened the package, it immediately brought a smile to my face. It was a purchase for my niece that turned one. I found it to be a very safe toy for her. Being a teddybear collector, I actually didn't want to give it up."
4,Booklet Stapler,"I am sure this will work just fine, I used one at the Board of Education Department. It truly helped with making folded booklets."
4,bostitch stapeler,"The book stapler in the beginning was excellent. I was using it to staple 2 page books together for a kindergarten project. After using about 1000 staples, the staples began to stick and I had to keep removing them. It was very frustrating. Maybe a different kind of staple would work better,but the stapler itself was very easy to operate and really great for making the booklets."
4,Booklet stapler from Bostitch,"Have used this stapler for about 4 weeks to staple church bulletins that are 2-3 sheets each. It works very well. Occasionally have a staple that doesn't fold down exactly right, but I think it is because I haven't used quite enough force. Have to pay attention to lining it up on the fold or the staples are a little forward or backward on the sheets, so when I'm in a hurry, they can be a little sloppy. But all in all, I am very pleased with the stapler and think it works as I would have expected. I made sure to get the chisel point staples another review recommended and 99% of the time, they work great."
3,Fantastic service,"I ordered a stapler from Cronky, through Amazon. The product arrived quickly, however it didn't work after the first staple. Through some delays on my part (ordering the right brand of staples, being on vacation, etc.), the final outcome was to return the stapler. Cronky was fantastic to work with via email. Responses were prompt and courteous. A full refund was initiated by Cronky to Amazon. Amazon was prompt to follow-up as well. Even though we will need to purchase a different stapler, I would highly recommend working with Cronky again."
3,"New Staple Tool from Prylex (tm),","This handheld office stapler is not really made strong enough for day to day wear and tear. Although compact and light, it doesn't hold enough staplers and one will eventually lose production time on changing them so often. Can staple only about 20 pages and other than that, the staples bend. Best use for at home projects like divorce papers and DUI reports."
5,Worthwhile addition,"Wavered between the stick-on vents (for an 03 Pontiac Montana) and in-the-channel type. Finally bought the in-channels then noticed the power window motor was struggling on the ""up"" mode. Rather than go thru an inevitable motor replacement, I switched to the stick-ons. They work fine and the window motor seems less stressed. Window vent shades of these types are valuable in the FL rainy season."
4,Great Shade,"i just picked up a new van, I'm a smoker and this shade allows me to smoke with a minimum of smoke in the compartment. Good product, good price......."
3,It is a good book,I was hoping for more in depth operational and philisophical description of how these brokers became successful. I would recommend this book for people who have not developed their business that thoroughly yet.
5,Bought this for my gf to try it out,"So far my gf is really loving it, she used to get treatments like chemical peels, microderms, and facials pretty regularly and to be honest, it was really eating up my wallet. So I got her a home version to try out, and she has really not asked me to buy her any spa treatments anymore, she've totally into doing it at home."
3,Works fine,I use these regularly and saved a lot of money. Only had one that I had to take out and clean with a q-tip once in a while before it was used up.
1,Beware of Inkgrabber.com,"Inkgrabber.com is listing refurbished and they send you compatible. BEWARE they do not sell what they advertise. They had no feedback when I made my purchase, so here is some accurate feedback."
2,"It's HP, but over 2 years expired","I thought I was getting a ""Brand New"" ink cartridge, and I did, BUT it expired on November 2008. This was never mentioned when I ordered, but was all over everything I received when the Cartridge came. Needless to say, I will not be getting 100% of the usuage out of this, if it works at all. I haven't installed it yet and don't know if I will. Just don't want to gum up my printer by savings a few bucks. The original box with this HP 57 catrridge also looks like it was smashed before or during shipping. This is not what I thought I was ordering. My Bad! Word to the wise... Make sure the cartridge you are ordering is ""New & Fresh"". Don't trust them to let you know."
3,Blood in blood out poster,Its a nice big poster of one of my favorite movies; however i was very disappointed in the discoloring for the price that i paid for it. It looks like a buffed out scanned picture and you can see lines and the color is very greyish looking. Other than that its a decent poster.
3,Not to be confused with...,"This is an interesting CD. Apparently, there is more than one act named ""Gnome"". One is a new-age group, another is a one-man gothic-deathmetal project from Japan, and then we have these guys. I don't know too much about them, except they hail from Seattle, and sound a lot like Nirvana. I would recommend this to anyone who likes grunge, especially Nirvana, since many of the songs have that character to them. There is the occasional lapse of production values, and a few dubious song choices, but there are a few gems here as well. Worth getting if you are a fan of the genre, or if you followed the band during their career, but not a must-have.Copies are available at very low prices, so there is very little risk here. It's worth checking out."
5,As advertised,The product is sturdy and was easily assembled. We are delighted to recommend it to every one that might see or ask about it.
5,Heavy duty!,Excellent structure. Winter coats now have someplace to be hung. Very sturdy! Couldn't believe the price on this!! Great value - wished that I has purchased it sooner!
5,A+ for Z Garment Rack,"Over the years, I have used the aluminum clothes racks and they proved to be AWFUL. I opted to buy a better rack and boy was I right. The Z Garment Rack will probably outlive me. It is strong, stable and just perfect for hanging wet and dry clothing. The ""Z"" shape is sort of odd, but having it on wheels makes up for that. I use the rack, roll it out of my way and go on about my business. No regrets here."
4,garment rack,Its a little tall for my needs but other then that its strong and sturdy.It also shipped earlier then expected.0verall I give it very good product and service. Thank you.
1,Terrible customer service!!,These are great racks but this is the worst seller I have ever dealt with. There was no tracking given. I tried repeated contact to reach this seller with no return email or phone call. These racks are great but buy them through another seller. My racks never arrived.
4,Worth the money,This rack is easy to assemble and strong. They even provide the tools necessary to put it together. The wheels make it easy to move around but lock when you want it to stay put. I feel it is worth the money.
3,quality control problems,"Good racks at a great price, but of the three purchased, one had a wheel with stripped threads and no nut and washer to install the wheel. This would have been an outstanding transaction except for the lack of quality control."
4,loving my z bac garment rack from Amazon.com,"I love the rack. I just wish it would have been adjustable in hieght. I also wish the price would have included the shelf that's sold seperatly for the bottom of the rack. If shipping and handling was not so expensive maybe I could have afforded the bottom rack. Never the less, my garment rack is of exceptional quality!"
