3,Nice Holiday Music but Arrangements Not Up to the Competition,"I bought this CD because I have been a longtime Nicholas Gunn fan. I own just about all of his music and always enjoy the uplifting sound of his flute and compositions. However, this contemporay instrumental holiday song package is not as good as other artists' collections; specifically, Ottmar Liebert (Poets and Angels and Christmas Santa Fe), Tingstad and Rumbel (Star of Wonder), Narada Christmas Collections, and Manheim Steamroller (4 different collections). While Gunn's flute sounds as good as ever, the arrangements and background instruments do not offer the same level of imagination as the others. Also, this CD is only 38 minutes -- should contain least 50-60 minutes of material. In summary, I can only recommend this release to Gunn's die hard fans because there are better compilations available."
4,For people who know the loyalty of dogs,"Delightful film done in a beautiful Scottish setting circa 1858. If you've ever had a really loyal dog, then this film is for you. Great message, family friendly.Based on a true story, this one will tug at your heart. It shows human nature at it's best and it's worst.As a westie owner, the dog actor really showed the attributes they are known for, hunting, loyalty, persistence and rugged stubborness."
1,Don't bother with this version; get the original Disney movie version,"The original Greyfriar's Bobby movie from Disney is one of my favorite movies... and my wife's absolute favorite. I was excited to see a new movie with a Westie in the title role. This latest version is a travesty! It strays from the original true story to put in a predictable and 100% fictitious story line involving a wicked mill owner (dirty capitalist!) who is bound to murder Bobby so his oppressed workers might not be distracted by the dog. What tripe! The original Greyfriar's Bobby story is true and the 1961 Disney sticks basically to the actual story. The actual story is truly remarkable! Why the makers of this latest version felt the need to ""spice it up"" I will never know. Their additions, including Bobby being a psychic and a dramatic performer of pantomime, are laughable for the wrong reasons and detract from the actual true story. Do your family a favor and buy the 1961 version instead."
4,dog lover,heart-warming story based on the life of a real dog who lived in Scotland. There is a statue in memory of his loyalty to his master.
3,A good kids story,"This is a heart warming story. When touring England, I actually saw a statue of Bobby and was told the story by our tour guide."
4,Touching movie based on true story,"Wee Bobby is an adorable little critter! I doubt if the real one was quite as smart as they made him out to be, but it's a fun movie for the family."
2,What??,the book is almost complete garbage... and underlined in racism. i got the best use from the Glossary and i wish it had more words.
3,Needs to swing a bit more.,"I will admit to beiong a bit dissappointed by this release. The band is good too, but it seems they try too hard to add Zappa's ""quirkiness"" to the tunes, instead of giving them their own stamp. The music didn't flow enough for me. Try Ed Palermo for really swinging jazz treatments of Zappa tunes. Palermo nails it. Still, it's good to hear Zappa's tunes being done by other bands. Hopefully people not familiar with Franks works will pick up on these releases and get turned on the the world of Zappa."
2,Less than expected,"I heard a quick review of this on NPR. From that, I expected more but received what I should have expected. I'm not a Frank Zappa fan. Most of his music sounds remedial and predictable, to me. Most of the CD's arrangements are more chaotic than melodic and pay tribute to Zappa's silly, Spike Jones side. That's cool if you like a rework of Spike Jones, but I'd hoped for something more interesting."
3,There was no evidence!,"Setups are everything! This one was not good. How does a tribunal of vigilantes go about the galaxy and capture alleged (by them)criminals without regard to the rule of law including Superman? Fortunately, there is plenty of galaxy-spanning action with excellent artwork on slick pages. Still, the setup needed to be better."
4,"Good Writing, Average Art","I thought that the book was well written but the art by some of the many illustrators was weak. I really liked Tom Grummet's, and Stuart Immonen's work though."
2,Uncompelling synthesis,"2 1/2The kind of alt-rock which only sounds mildly appealing, masking songwriting shallowness with faux-edgy production and pointed sprinklings of potency."
5,one of my favorite albums i own,My title says it all. The music is CREATIVE. One thing many bands lack these days. It sounds like 70's rock mixed with newer alternative. If I had to give them a nickname it would be woobie. Because I like my woobie and its cuddly. GET THE ALBUM. GET ALL OF THEIR ALBUMS.
5,the underground music scene's best kept secret,"hands down one of the most mind-altering albums I've ever heard. for those that are intrigued by mesmerizing headtrips that you can temporarily lose yourself in, it's a one-way ticket to otherworldliness, no drugs necessary. I second the opinion that this band, solely for its music, deserves more recognition. These guys need to get a better PR manager. also one of the best live performances i've ever experienced - for people who prefer the red pill."
3,Awesome Live Show,"I hadn't heard of Lake Trout until last night at about 10pm, when they took the stage at The Social here in Orlando. They were the second band to play that night, as openers for Pinback. After the show was over, I had decided I like Lake Trout's performance more than Pinback's, the band I went to see in the first place.I bought their most recent album, Another One Lost, at the show, and though I was kinda dissapointed I didn't hear the rawness and excellence I heard on stage that night, Lake Trout is still an awesome band. I recommend seeing them live any chance you get, you'll be surely entertained.By the way, their guitarist (Ed Harris if I've deduced the names correctly) is just great...the way he moves is kinda mesmerizing. I have no idea how he keeps the beat moving like a worm like that. But I digress, GO SEE TROUT LAKE LIVE!"
2,"A fair start, but I probably won't use it to teach my son.","I too found the constant references to the Gulf War tiresome. I also found some factual errors (koalas are not bears) and a few words that were spelled wrong. I will use the book as a reference, but will find other books to use, also."
1,Get another book...,"The information is outdated. The book seems to be based on the writers' opinions rather than research. Content organization and layout is confusing, along with a VERY poor index. I do not support the usage of controlled substances but this book simply tries to brainwash the reader that cocaine is the worst thing to happen to earth and that cocaine users are evil. I would go with another book that helps you make the right decision by showing you facts."
5,"If you only take one travel resource, THIS IS IT!","Even after several trips to the area we still rely on our Can Do map. This is the best resource for the area from Cancun to Tulum that we have seen. It lists just about every hotel, condo, villa, restaurant, market, shop, bank and service available. Laura and Perry also give lots of good advise on places to visit and they include information about the various attractions such as hours of operation, admission prices, etc. Don't leave home without it!"
5,Everything you need in one map,I ordered the Riviera Maya guide/map for our first trip in July. It answered all our questions we had as to where certain destanations were from where we are staying and so forth. It showed how far south of Cancun we will be staying. All kinds of restaurants to try and shops to visit. I was certainly interested in the ruins but always heard it was quite a trip from Cancun. We will be staying in Playa Del Carmen and that seemed a little more centrally located on the map.This will be the first thing I pack for the trip! Thanks to Laura and Perry for such a great map.
5,Super Fantastic Travel Book in the Form of a Map!!Kewl,"I have been to the Cancun~Tulum Corridor now refered to as Riviera Maya on 5 different occasions since 1995 and find this Travel Book Map to show me places that I have driven by for the last 4 years. I would say that the detail of Hotels, Restaurants, Condominiums, Bungalows, Cabanas, Grocery Stores, Tourist Playgrounds, Mayan Ruins and other facts are just not available in any other source. I would not leave for the Riviera Maya without it! I would recommend this Travel Book Map to anyone without hesitation. The cost of the Map will be returned to the user over and over again on just one trip to the Riviera Maya. Thanks to Laura and Perry McFarlin. Bill in Tulsa."
5,Can-Do Riveria Maya Map,"We purchased this map for our honeymoon trip to the Mayan Rivera. It was an excellent investment. It tells you the approximate price of various cab fares to different locations. It even provides you with a list of alternative transportation services. All activities of the area are listed and even most all resturants. The best part is they offer their own reviews of the resturants and give good adivce on where to go. I highly reccommend this map if you are planning a trip. Even if you set everything up through a travel agent, this has tons of listings for things you may not hear about and may enjoy doing."
2,Comes apart at swivel,"My wife had one of these for two years and it came apart at one of the swivel joints in the handle. I purchased a replacement ... which came apart at a swivel joint after only one day. The vendor kindly sent another, which also has a swivel joint that looks pretty suspicious ... time will tell."
1,big mistake,"The picture is of Musical Scarves and Activities which I ordered, but I got some kind of math chart. Totally ridiculous waste of my time. Somebody needs to fix this mistake."
1,fugedaboudit,Save your money unless you want to watch a bored Entwhistle go through the motions demonstrating his eccentric style.
4,I Don't Even Play Bass....,"and I found this DVD interesting. There are insights about how he played that I, as a fan of his playing, which you must be if you're bothering to read this, found enlightnening, especially regarding his ""country western"" influence. (HA! HA! Now you're curiosity is piqued and you HAVE to buy it. Hey Amazon, do I get a commission?).I can only imagine how this DVD would benefit someone who does play bass guitar.Also recommended: AN OX'S TALE & THUNDERFINGERSJack"
4,Nelly's 'N The Mix,"Band Member, Justin Timberlake had a hand or two into getting this track together. Originally there is no Nelly in this mix. The studio CD version is all *NSYNC,and so comes the same for the video released New Years Eve 2003.A few months later it had been announced of a remixed version of both song, and video. In it Nelly raps his verses, and Justin flows all too easily beside him.This disc includes the audio and video remixes, plus fans can view the photo gallery!"
5,Great Colaboration!,Two great artists come together to make a remix of an already popular song...what could go wrong. It is very good!
1,Thank you crankyreviewer,"Thank you cranky_reviewer for your intellectual e-mail. For that I decided to give ""Girlfriend"" another 1 star review for NSTINK. Maybe you'll realize how much they stink?"
3,a cure for insomnia,this proves how much nelly went mainstream this is for trl fans caught in the placebo syndrome.
1,PLEASE wait for the Decca Broadway remaster!!,"I want to strongly advise against anybody purchasing this shoddily mastered Box Office Recordings CD of ""Song of Norway"". The score is beautiful, but this CD makes all of the singing voices sound like mush! Decca Broadway (the REAL owners of the masters of the original recording) will be making a remastered CD of ""Song of Norway"" which is scheduled to be released in the fall of 2003. Please be patient and wait for the remaster. Don't even THINK about getting THIS CD!"
2,Horrible remastering of dated operetta,"This is as clear as mud - the songs are lovely and the singing is fine but the transfer from original discs is substandard. Also to note the libretto and dialogue (even for 1946) are the poorest ever recorded. Embarrassingly awful writing with putrid attempts to act - it was not a loss at all to have a lot of the recorded dialogue cut for the LP transfer.For the record:The LP eliminated:3. Opening dialogue of FREDDY AND HIS FIDDLE5. Opening dialogue and musical intro to STRANGE MUSIC7. Entire cut except for final few words9. Three minutes of opening dialogue10. Two minutes of musical introCuts 6 and 7, cuts 10 and 11 and cuts 13 and 14 were double bands recorded onto single sides of the 12 inch 78-rpms. Maximum time for a side of this size was 4 and one half minutes.The score needs a modern studio reproduction sans dialogue. This CD is a very very poor incarnation of the original recording."
3,"Historical, but so dated beautiful music","I would like to give this Musical five stars, for purpose and effort; but for that alone. In 1945 the concept was aesthetically and politically relevant;the music of Grieg wondrous and the lyrics, well, pretrty campy. The cast,excellent. This CD is worth having for its historical position in American Musical Theatre. But, it is so dated.Kitty Carlisle is a gem, and lucky to hear in prime voice but sadly, she is not Ira Petina. This is a a beautful, naive, ""nation-at- war"" amd ""lets remember Norway"" musical"
1,Poor Audio,Had I known that this reproduction of the original cast was not re-mastered I would not have considered it. I had no idea that what I enjoyed in 1944 on an LP was going to be so terrible.
2,Get the 1990 2-disc recording instead,"There is a beautifully recorded studio cast, recorded in the UK, available for those who want the complete score. Amazon carries it; just search for: Song Of Norway 1990 London Studio Cast"
2,Horrible CDs,"The CDs that come with the book are horrible. Each lesson starts with up to 40 seconds of guitar music. Each time you want to review the lesson (which is the whole point of having the CDs), you have to listen to the stupid guitar music. Again and again and again.Next, each track starts with an annoying woman commanding you to ""Listen!"" That gets real old real fast. What else would you do BUT listen? Between the idiot music and the annoying woman, you want to toss the CDs into the trash. And yet without the CDs the book is almost worthless.The only way to fix this problem is to spend yet another $30 on audio editing software, and remove the useless and annoying junk from every track, and burn new actually useful CDs.Why the author thought that we are all MTV-generation morons, who needed to be ""entertained,"" instead of educated, is a mystery. Thus, instead of a $45 book, you really have to pay $75, if you want a useful product."
3,Not exactly what I was expecting,"I haven't made it very far into the book, probably just a few first chapters and I have to say I am already very resistant to a lot of the suggestions: wearing control top granny panties, wearing other types of 'slimming' body wear underneath your regular clothes...I decided that was too restraining a long time ago and I don't think it helps any with regard to comfort. However, she does have some great advice for finding jeans that look good and mentions taking into account that the width of the lower leg of a jean or pant for heavier women should be equal or greater than the width of the woman's thigh, that way visually you look slimmer on your thighs. With tips like this even a non restraining-underwear wearing lady can find ways to look better. I recommend it but advise women to decide for themselves what works for them in terms of comfort."
2,some novel ideas here,"Unfortunately the novel ideas are farfetched, odd or ineffective. If you already have a book of this genre, you don't need this one. Mediocre."
1,Not a help,"This book did not help me one bit. The book pretty much said to go out and buy a new wardrobe and not wear granny [...]... What are the people with a low-budget income supposed to do? They won't have enough money to go buy new clothes. It was a waste of my money, and I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody."
3,Need tips on posing for the papparazzi? Me neither.,"Bottom Line: no astounding new fashion revelations, reads like an advice column geared towards the 20-something crowd.This book addresses the very basics of the principles of dressing in the most general way, with advice thrown in on drinking, not exercising, and posing for pictures. The catty, somewhat cliche tone Danica Lo uses makes this book feel more like you're reading a gossip blog than a fashion how-to (read: more gossipy than helpful). Overall, this book is pretty run-of-the-mill.There are parts of this book I found useful - the 3 page chapter on scientific scent, for example.Anyway, beyond the occasional smirk-inducing line, there is not much here. Hope this helps!"
5,Excellent guide!,This is a great book. I was making notes as I read it. It's especially great when you pair it with the advice in Science of Sexy by Bradley Bayou.
3,I was disappointed,"Based on a newspaper article, I expected more on how to dress to minimize the appearance of ""fat"", so I was disappointed that a lot of the book was how to stand (pigeon-toe'd?!)and what angle to stand or sit. These may be of benefit for photos, but I cannot see myself deliberately positioning every moment of my day. How would anything get done?"
5,Brilliant and Insightful,"This book is chock full of clever tips and ideas for anyone who has wanted to look and feel better about themselves. I felt like the thin person screaming inside me was ready to come out. The author, Danica Lo uniquely approached and tackled a sensitive issue with all women. I encourage you to buy this for someone you love. Who couldn't use more confidence?"
3,Great case - weak clock works,"The case, lens and controls are well made and of excellent quality; a very attractive clock. However, the clock mechanism does not match this quality. The control knobs are connected to very fragile shafts in the clock works and break off very easily rendering the clock of little use. I was very disappointed in this easy failure and did not consider it worth replacing.."
1,The so called stone was a piece of plastic!,"This stone in this ring was just a peice of paper glued too the ring to look like a stone. I just wonder can you also buy differant Peices of paper to get a ""differant"" ring?"
3,"Great Writing, Poor Text","This is written for the Hardinge Simpole 2002 softcover. The narrative in this book is excellent. Eales writes a history readable for the layman. It is a complete history, from the origins in Islam through to the 1980s. This is, after all, a digital reprint of the 1985 publishing. Which brings me to why I rated this only 3 stars: the print is blurry. Simply put, it looks like poor quality photocopying. With the small font (definitely smaller than 12pt) the fuzzy quality is quite the eye strain."
2,For what it is: **,"My folks wouldn't let me go to see this when it first came out, so I finally got my chance. I can't say that I liked it and I certainly can't say that I enjoyed it. The acting is atrocious. The production values put it on the same level as a filmed-in-a-basement-apartment '70s porn film. (Not that I've ever seen one!) It alternates between being deathly dull and repulsively violent. A curiosity at best."
1,I don't think so!,"I wanted this movie a long while, before actually purchasing it. And I purchased it not knowing anything, except what the cover depicted. When I put it in, I realized it was a little older (30 years), but gave it a chance anyway. At the end of the movie my son (after having kept his ears and eyes covered for a good portion of the movie) asked why it said it was scary on the cover. After taking it out of the DVD player, I actually looked at the disk to make sure this was what I had paid for and had received such rave reviews. I'm afraid the only people that could give this movie more than two stars would be deranged."
2,Exploitation ...,"...This is not aHorror"" movie but rather a cheply made exploitation film ...The acting is bad, the script is bad and this film is horrible except for the rather campy ending of revenge with the father who weilds a chainsaw and buzzes the maniac who raped his daughter. The extras on the dvd were better than the movie..."
1,DO NOT LISTEN TO THE HYPE,"I wish there was an option to give negative stars, but oh well. This movie is a classic example of the 70s movie made for about 50 bucks, the actors, I use that term loosely, were terrible, wes craven should have apologized to the rest of the world for this one. Some one told me this was one of the most ""disturbing "" movies ever made, i sure was disturbed that I paid 12 bucks for this pile. My advice, if you really want this movie, take 12 dollars from your wallet and set it on fire, thats pretty much the feeling you'll get from ""last dump on the left"""
1,Last House on the Left,The movie was recommended to us and was a huge disappointment. It was definitely a B rated movie. The music DID not fit with the plot or the scenes. We ended up selling it to the person who recommended it.
1,"Very disturbing, sick & sadistic torture movie","This ranks right up there with I Spit On Your Grave. I can't conceive how some fans of cult/horror films would possibly find something like this entertaining & want to put it in their collections.It is NOT entertaining or enjoyable in the least. Almost an hour & a half of two young women being raped & tortured by pathetic scumbags is not my idea of a good movie. It is unnerving, unsettling & very sad. I would have given it zero stars if I could, but that wasn't an option, I guess. I strongly recommend not buying this film, it is well beyond redemption. In any case, don't say you weren't warned."
3,"3 1/2 stars ""disturbing""","this film is very disturbing and bloody for the 1970'sand still is a bit disturbing for today.the film is about 2 girls who get kidnaped,beat,raped,and much more.yes this film is abit disturbing but wes really wanted the people to see how killers cross the line and show no feelings in there doings.dont watch this film if sex crimes really get to you. this film has nudity,graphic violence,rape,sexualy content."
2,"Scary, but not as good as I thought it'd be.","So this movie was awkward and creepy, but it was also rather dumb. Wes Craven did a good job giving an unusual ""scary"" feel to it, but the movie itself was rather ""idiotically-cheesy""! The content was rather off for the 70's (when it came out), and viewing the movie can make you rather nautious. It really wasn't that bad, but I'm kind of wishing I wouldn't have spent the money for it."
1,[junk],"This movie and the other 'I spit on your grave' are [junk.] very exploitive to women. Movies like these make rape look like a male sport pastime and alot of these reviewers, men especially, seem to enjoy it. This movie is sick and degrading, not to mention the horrible acting and stupid characters. Does anyone notice that the girl who is killed by the lake continues to move and breathe after she is supposedly dead????? Talk about low budget filth."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"I am old enough to remember when this was playing at the drive-in theatre. Someone has edited this (once cult classic) to the extent it is just a ""STUPID"" old movie! It is for certain a ""SICK"" movie, it was supposed to be. Now however the PG13 version is just ""STUPID"" and a waste of time. I was forced to give 1 star but not by choice...I give this version a big zero!"
1,-100 billion stars,"This movie is a painfull experience. I'm really not that pickey when it comes to movies but I can honestly say this is the worst movie I have ever seen in every sense of the word. This movie has no redeaming qualities other than the fact that it eventually ends. When you start this movie you will wish you never started it. I'm a Wes Craven fan but even he is probably ashamed of this. I'll say it one more time, this is the worst movie I have ever seen and in no way is this frightening. It may be a little disturbing, but even the diturbing parts are not entertaining, they are just terrible. The plot? Honestly, if you have find any plot email me cause I am curious as to what this painful experience is all about. Slit your wrist or take a lot of mind expanding drugs before even considering this."
1,Dont see this moive!,please do not waste your time watching this moive. It is just a bad 70's b Flick. Really bad.
1,At least he would get better....,"Wes Craven's first movie and also his worst. I saw this movie really wanting to enjoy it, however in the end it is just a bad, bad movie. As a matter of fact it is #9 on my worst movie list. The story is about three escaped con's who capture,rape and kill a girl in the woods next to her house. The girls parents find out about the killing and take there revenge.This could have been a good revenge movie, even a drama if Craven just put a little effort into it. As we saw this year with In The Bedroom, a fantastic film also along the same premise (they both deal with the loss of a child, and a parents revenge) a movie like this can be a good, serious drama.This movie is not only slow but it also has mabey the worst score I have ever heard. It is so distracting at time's that it take's away from the movie."
3,Not enough sexual tension to be worth it.....,"I was disappointed with this '70's era explotation film. While it has some grusome scenes of disembowelments etc., it fell far short of the sexual tension necessary to rate 5 stars from me. I only gave it 3 stars (as opposed to 1) because it did have some minor sexual situations that would not be found in films made today. I think if its bloody violent scenes you are looking for, purchase ""Ilsa, The She Wolf of the SS"". It has lots of bloody torture scenes, but also lacks in the sexual arena as well. All in all, I wish I could get my money back on this film."
1,I'll Never Forget this Movie,"I saw ""Last House on the Left"" on September 22, 1972 with 2 of my friends. I was 16 years old. We only made it through about 1/2 the movie. We left when the huge knife flung up. This movie was gruesome, and I can hardley recommend it. I was so shaken up about this movie I could not sleep for weeks. Even now I feel upset writing this. I have since rented the movie to compare how I felt then to how I feel now. It still has an impact, but not as much as it did back then. I believe that is because movie content has changed over the years and there are far more disturbing movies out today. I had no idea what was going to happen in the movie and was shocked to see what happened to the 2 girls that hitch hiked into New York City to see a concert. If you like gore and watching psychos in action, rent this movie. I guarantee you will feel sick after you see it."
1,Garbage on the left side of the last shelf,"Why make movies like this? It serves no purpose whatsoever. While other horror flicks have some wisdom to impart, if only the partial wisdom that there is real evil in this world, this one has absolutely no merit whatsoever. If one was to infer anything from it, it is that the producers are vile. It seems that audiences enjoy horrible themes because they don't have horror in their own lives: obviously, the distance from the horrible fate of others is a sense of consolation that is mistaken by the viewer as entertainment. Others seem to concede it and embrace it with some dark pleasure. It is only wise counsel that notes all life is destined to death and the second side of the coin: what are people going to do about it? I thank God for Jesus Christ who will resurrect the faithful to new life with incorruptible bodies and the termination of any power of death over such lives. I know of no hospital that can make those guarantees."
4,Four Stars for the commentary and extras,"Wes Craven and Sean S. Cunningham (as well as Steve Miner who had a small part in making the film) essentially started their careers with this bit of 70's trash. I'll be honest the film itself, viewed in modern times, without the filmmakers' commentary to explain the films many flaws, is nearly unwatchable. Its cruelly violent. Its disturbing in a bad way. And most of all its just not an interesting story... But... If you do watch the commentary and you do watch the making of featurette, you are in for a major treat. Budding filmmakers like myself will be extatic to hear stories of how two ledgendary directors (Craven of Nightmare on Elm Street fame, and Cunningham of the original Friday the 13th) got their start in the industry. Its just a lot of fun hearing the horror stories behind this terrible movie and how they made it work. They must have done something right because thirty years later people are still watching it for the first time."
3,Good,Many people often only hear that this movie was about rape but it was more then that you could feel for the parents and agree with what they did. To me it seemed like a documentry that would be on A and E
1,"SUCKED, SUCKED, SUCKED, SUCKED!","I was watching something on tv one night & they were talking about this movie saying it was the best scary movie ever. What a JOKE that turned out to be! This movie sucked! The special effects were terrible,& the acting was at best,awful! You shouldn't even waste your money spending 2 bucks to rent it!"
1,If you want a good laugh...,"Rent or purchase the DVD version of this piece of ... and watch the film makers speak ""seriously"" about their ""creation."" If you think the film is a cheesy, ... attempt to cash in on a teenage audience in need of ... shocks, you'll really get a kick out of Wes Craven waxing serious, and describing his ""academic"" considerations. What a self-inflated .... The film makers routinely describe this mess as ""disturbing."" The really disturbing aspect of Last House On The Left is that it launched a successful, commercial career."
1,This is SO dumb!,"This isn't horror, this is ....! Wes Craven's film debut is a primitive little production that rises above its cut-rate production values and hazy, grainy patina via its grimly affecting portrait of human evil infiltrating a middle-class household. This film failed miserably to accomplish what it wanted to do. This isn't scary, disturbing, or disguisting (except the ""biting"" scene). Don't waste your time or money on this piece of crud!!!"
1,No One Should Waste Their Money......,"This was the worst movie I have ever seen in my life...I could barely sit through it...and I watch alot of horror movies and I love Wes Craven....what happened to Wes with this movie? I'm surprised they let him make another movie after this one!It is NOT scarey at all...The dialogue is horrible, the acting is the worst, and the music!! It reminds me of the music they would play in a comedy/hillbilly type movie...Where is the house on the DVD cover? Not to be found...And it happens at night in the dark? Not really...most of the movie happens in daylight....I would not take this money if they gave it to me for free...The worst movie of all time!"
3,not for the faint of heart,"This movie is fantasitic, but i honestly couldnt tell you that i enjoyed watching it. From the master of horror, his debut film is his most shocking. This will sreioulsy mess with you.But still, a must see."
1,Didn't do much for me.,"After reading all the hype, I felt incredibly let down. Perhaps living in the early 21st century with terrorists who kill thousands with their cowardly attacks on civilians buildings has blunted my sensitivities and hundred of hours of watching various zombies, euro-demons and power tool wielding revenants has dulled my sense, but I found this movie to be somewhat tame. Sure, the vile murders in this film were the kind of evil that deserves to be eradicated and we occassionally wandered into cruelty and depravity, the whole undertone of the film kept being neutered by a comic relief sheriff duo.I'm sure that this was really disturbing back in the 70's, but I felt the movie hasn't aged well. It is definitely worth watching as historical reference, but I can't say that it was really even disturbing. If this caused folk to flee the theaters throwing-up, I wonder what Hellrazor or Evil Dead would have done if we could have shown it to those audiences."
3,"first half good, second half terrible",I saw this movie when it first came out and as a mother of two teenage girls it really scared me. it was good up to the point where the parents figured out who these people were & then it just got stupid. But I never forgot about it.
4,Horrifying BECAUSE it is so possible,"I saw this movie initially at a drive in when it was initially released. I have rarely been so profoundly disturbed by a film as by this one. The bottom line is that the ""bad guys"" are utterly pedestrian. The setting is as mundane as setings get. The crime is set-up by the film and carried out in such a way that it is very clearly possible. There are no heroes in the end. The girls don't get away, and the end is hopeless as ends so often are. The least believeable part of the film is the retribution exacted by the parents.See the film, but expect to be bothered by it."
3,disturbing or one of a kind?,"This movie is a disturbing movie right from the beginning, even if it a very disturbing movie its concept is very one of a kind. If u have a weak stomach I suggest you dont watch this movie. It starts off with two girls that are going to a concert but run into an escape confict and wish to buy drugs. This leads to their kidnap, rape, and murder by the convict and his dad, grandfather and the dad's girlfriend. The murderers end up staying at one of the girls house and her parents realize that they had killed their daughter. They take matters into their own hands which is unbelivable they way they handle it."
4,Well-crafted and disturbing movie...,"The Last House on the Left was not quite what I would classify as a horror movie, but it is quite interesting, nonetheless. There are a few graphically violent scenes, but they were comically balanced out by a pair of inept policemen tracking the attackers.The dialogue is fairly realistic, and Sandra Cassel and Lucy Grantham play a pair of engaging best friends on their way to a concert by their favorite band, Bloodlust. When they try to buy some marijuana from a guy on the street, they end up in a nightmare that ultimately leads back to the house of one of the girls.The scariest part of the movie is the simple fact that what goes on in this movie (the girls being attacked moreso than the revenge) could so easily happen in real life. This movie is not for anyone bothered by torture or brutality."
1,"Not even 1 star...deserves a ""0 star"" rating if that were possible...","I'd heard great things about this movie, that it's ""very disturbing"" and that it's a ""classic."" My husband is not a fan of older movies and he needed a little convincing before I was able to get him to watch it with me. I regretted it not long after the movie began. This is THE most awful movie I have ever seen. My husband kept telling me to turn it off, but I kept telling him to wait a bit longer, that the movie will become more interesting. When the credits rolled, we actually had a fight!"
2,Not What I Had Envisioned.......,"Those that were around when this first came out should remember that there was somewhat of a stir about this movie in some cicles. Basically it's reputation preceded it and many of us were horrified at the thought of the movie without actually ever seeing it. The trouble is, is that once you did see it, it was a major let down, mainly because it is really poorly shot and most of the script is totally unbelievable(the parents revenge portion anyway). The flipside is that we did'nt come to watch a movie with a good scipt and top notch acting--we came as depraved curiosity seekers and some of what we saw was truly disturbing. Was it as disturbing as we had envisioned---no. Did it live up to it's reputation--no. It's really a toss up I would guess. I think it served a purpose in 72' but now it seems like a student film and I guess to some degree it was."
3,Disturbing and flawed...but still worth seeing.,"Before watching this film, I read many reviews. I prepared myself for a scary trip. It was not scary. It was tense and uncomfortable, at best. Once I realized I was not going to be freaked out or psycologically damaged, I began to watch the film for the piece of history that it is. It WAS ground breaking for it's time, and it does have some great moments: 1. After Mari's rape, the recognition by the gang members that they have crossed a terrible line and that they were now changed forever, 2. The chicken-truck lady, and 3: the doctor & nurse scene, to name a few. Watch this movie with a spirit of nostalgia and analysis, and you won't be disapointed. If you are looking for a terrifying ride, move on."
1,"In this case, less is not more.","Oh wow, don't bother. I have been told time and time again that this is one of the most disturbing movies ever made. If disturbing means ridiculously cartoonish, bland, poorly edited, complete with amateurish acting - then disturbing it is. I may have half-cringed at a few of the scenes, and maybe it had some cinematic value for 1972 - the year it was released. And sure, it may be strong coffee for the squeamish. But I can't help but remember The Wizard of Oz having more moments of spooky dramatic tension than this. If you want a genuinely disturbing Wes Craven film, watch The Serpent and the Rainbow. I look back now and laugh at how hesitant I was to watch this crap burger of a film out of fear of how frightening it would be. Another 90 minutes of my life, and not to mention $4.99, pissed away."
1,Last house on the ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"let's get strait to the point, this movie [stinks]! There is nothing scary about this movie, not disturbing, not even cool, it reeks with stupidity and Wes trying to cause controversy. The only ""painful"" scene is were a guy gets his special friend bit off. That's it! This film diserves to be burnt, and it owes me a star!"
1,Complete crap,"This ranks among the stupidest movies I've ever seen. I gave it one star only because there's no option for zero stars. The quality sucks, the acting sucks, the music sucks, the story sucks. And some people actually gave it 5 stars? Hope I never meet 'em."
2,The Last House on the Left,"The movie was a huge disappointment. I thought it was going to be a update from the 1974 version. HA The joke was on me. It says 2009 but still the same old version. If I had known that I would never have bought it. What a joke. Any one who buys this movie will be greatly disappointed.MaryColumbus,MS"
3,eh its differnt,"this movie isnt really supposed to be something u treasure like many horror movies, this is supposed to be real, sick,demented and F***ed up"
3,unique or disturbing?,"the way wes craven made this movie maybe think... was this a unique or disturbing movie? the ideas and script of this movie is something ive never seen before. its unique because the concept of this movie is original but its disturbing the way the movie goes. two girls are on their way to a concert when they run into a escape convict and his dad and grandfather and the girlfriend. they get kidnapped and get taken into the woods where the humiliate, torture, rape and kill the two girls. the murderers end up staying in one of the girls parents house where the parents find out they murdered their daughter by a necklace they see on one of the guys. they take matter into their own hands when they find the body of their dead daughter. they kill the murderers an a most brutal murder. i would recomend this movie to anyone who likes unusual and disturbing killing movies but not to anyone with a weak stomach."
1,Man oh man....,"You talk about disappointed, this is the icing on the cake. All I hear about is how scary and cutting edge this was. Not even close. Whatever big shot film critics say that are truly wrong. I love older movies too and am open minded to the change in times and such. There are actually some scary or at least entertaining horror flicks during the 70's, but this is not one of them. Seriously, don't buy this. I don't know why it is so highly regarded. The acting, story, and especially the music is terrible. It's like porn quality acting, a story written in about 25 minutes and music from a Disney movie. It could have been a good movie if they would have taken out the attempt at comedy, threw in some disturbing music, and made the bad guys, well, more bad. It could be remade (which I'm usually against)."
1,Now it all makes sense why society is what it is,"I remember seeing young people lined up to see this movie when it was released. I just dismissed it as another horror movie. Well, I came across this on HBO one night in a hotel. I watched about a total of 20 minutes of it.What were those younger people doing going to see this piece of violent, sickening crap? It now makes sense why our country, especially the youth, is going down the toilet. I question whether some of them were even old enough to see it (but they got in the theater nevertheless). Wes Craven was much better off doing the Nightmare series. At least those could be dismissed as science fiction.This movie is just bad acting, disturbing violence beyond belief and mutilation. If you enjoy this type of movie, I question your soul. How could one enjoy seeing a girl brutally raped? If that gets you off, lock yourself away before you carry it out yourself (and hopefully get shot for doing so)."
1,wasted effort,"All these grand reviews, are you kidding?, this is junk!, stupid premise, really stupid dialog, and the characters are paper thin, the cops, there are no cops this stupid anywhere, run out of gas?, none in the trunk?, did they leave the police radio on the checker board? please! I couldn't figure if this was a comedy or, choke, serious?, we really got a lot of laughs from it! It was plain to see it was shoot on a shoestring and his efforts did get better in later films, but, this was awful!"
1,"Horrible, Horrible Movie","For many, many years I heard nothing but great reviews about this movie. I heard it was one of the scariest movies of all times. This excited me because I am a huge fan of older horror films so I bought the tape. What a disappointment. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. Absolutly terrible. I found it to be more of a comedy than anything else. It's just plain stupid and quite boring. Do yourself a favor, stay away from this movie."
1,Terrible Movie,"I absolutely hated this movie. They spent way too much time on the rape scene almost as if they were glorifying it. The only reason it gets 1 star is because of the ending, the only part I liked."
5,The Original Masterpiece.,"The Original last house on the left does not disappoint. It differs in small ways from the modern day remake of the same name. But, take heart these little differences are what make this movie stand apart from it's remake counter part. Though the plot is virtually the same, The deaths are different. Lets face it good deaths and plot twists are what people go to see movies like this for. View this movie if you wish to know how Wes Craven, and Sean S. Cunningham became the horror icons they are today. You will be pleased with what you find if horror and gore are what you seek. Oh and be for warned it's not for the casual horror fan, or anybody that has a weak stomach. With that being said happy viewing horror fans."
2,The film that gave birth to the Slasher genre!,"A very offbeat movie that showcases the darker side of human nature. I am sure when movie goers first saw this film back in the sixties they were repulsed by the graphic imagery since nothing like it had existed before. To be sure, it IS a classic. But I am not certain that many people will get the same thrill out of it, since most slasher films are much more shockingly violent nowadays."
3,gory,take this movie for what it is. a slasher flick that gives you a lot of gore and very little plot. it can't be called a classic but it is not that bad.
3,last house on the left,Some people hyped this item for the so-called gore and also forthe artistry. I didn't think either one were that extreme.
2,Not the Best,I thought that this movies was a slight mockery to the true crime that happened. From the cheesey music to the two idiot Police officers the movies seemed like it was suppose to be some kind of comedy. I don't think it really depicted the true crime.
1,Last House on the Left,"I has seen this movie when it came out in 1972, this was suppose to show ""never before seen scenes"" ! Well it didn't !!!! There were scenes left out ! This was the worst purchase I ever made,,,I was real dissappointed."
1,What a joke,"Wes Wes Wes!!!! I know there were a lot of hallucinagens in the 70s but what the hell kind of trips were you on when you made this movie?! Lets just get straight to the point.. the point being that this movie sucks, in fact it sucks so bad that Im afraid to say that it sucks because I feel like Im picking on a handycapped child. The story...(yawn sip of coffee) slow and boring. Not scary a little psychoish. The soundtrack...well folks its like mixing the theme from the partridge family with Michael Myers in Halloween. It doesnt work. No suspense no buildup in the movie no scares. Save your money dont rent it either if someone offers to give you this movie for free just laugh in their face for owning it take it home throw it in your dvd player for 10 minutes try not to fall asleep press eject when youve had enough take the disc out and use it as a clay pidgen for your shotgun. I forgive you Wes."
3,No need to go on and on and on.....,"Last House isn't a masterpiece, nor is it junk. If I were basing the review on acting alone, it would be 1 star. Ditto a lot of the camerawork. But what you need to remember is that it was the film that ushered in a whole generation of ultra-violent, and, more importantly, psychologically disturbing films. If you see it as boring or lame, you obviously weren't around when it was first released. That's the mind-set you have to put yourself in before viewing, or just don't bother. For its time, it was VERY violent and EXTREMELY disturbing. Remember, this is even pre- Texas Chainsaw... There were no other films like it at the time -- none. Considering the budget he had, Craven managed to create something that, even today with so much more having been done, still manages to stay with you a while after you've seen it. The extras? NO great shakes, honestly. But the film alone is, like it or not, history."
3,A documentary on rape & murder.,"Last house on the Left is a truly sickening movie, not because of gore or splatter effect, but simply because what it shows & what it is about. If you're looking for a shocking & contraversial movie to add to your collection it's a must, but if you're looking for a movie to enjoy, try one of Wes' later movies instead. This one is too revolting to be enjoyable.The story revolves about a couple of psycho's who for no real reason at all decide to abduct, humiliate, rape & then kill 2 young girls. Made in the very dry style of Texas Chainsaw Massacre it is a movie that leaves a definate bitter taste in your mouth. Admittedly the dick chewing scene is rather well done. Not a movie to recommend for anyone but Craven completists, & people looking to own every contraversial movie made. A true Video ( DVD ) Nasty."
4,Crikey O'Reilly!,"I watch a lot of horror movies. I seek out the most disturbing movies I can find. I was so eager to get this one, which I'd read about for many years, that I actually pre-ordered it. When I got it, I couldn't wait.I actually fainted while watching it.I don't think it's a particularly good movie; many parts of it are dreadful. But I have to say, the trailer was right. To avoid fainting, I SHOULD have kept repeating..."
1,Goodness Gracious............,"Thank goodness for free rentals at my local video store!!!!!!! I choose to rent this movie as my ""free"" rental because I'm such the horror fan and I've heard alot about this movie. This movie should be free to Anyone who rents it! I know this is an old movie and one of Wes Craven's first projects........ thank goodness he's come a long way since then!! Evidentally he had a very low budget to work on with this film. The shooting and acting were terrible. I think my 3 cats could have done better with a hand held cam corder. Anyway, the only good thing about this movie, if you can call it good, is the bloody scenes. I'm quite the gore fan. Other than that, it took everything in me to watch this movie until the end..... but out of curiousity I did. Please don't waste your money on renting this movie.... unless you get it as a free rental and want to kill an hour and a half of your time if you are truly bored to death!"
2,2 1/2 stars - I'm sure it was more exciting in the early 70's,"I guess I missed the point. I can see how this film could be considered a horror ""classic"". I'm sure the violence was ground breaking in 1972... in fact, one of the comments in the ""making of"" on this dvd was that teenagers were actually throwing up in the theatres. I don't think it's a well done film overall... it's lacking in story, music, direction, and suspense. The acting is not too bad, but could have been more intense and believable in some scenes. If I was craving some good 1970's horror, I'd rather watch ""I Spit on Your Grave"" or ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre""."
5,This is a HARD ONE to watch!!,"This is the type of film that can only be viewed once in a great while for me cause of the true and disturbing nature of the plot. The story involves two blossoming beauties, one from the country and one from the city, who go into the city to check out a concert. What awaits them is relentless terror brought on by a group of sickos who have no regard for human life whatsoever. Actually based on Ingmar Bergman's Jungfrukällan (The Virgin Spring). So many other films have tried to use the same concept, but NONE come close to this. The DVD is a must own for the awesome extras, though the image and sound are dated."
2,Primal Instincts,"Horror is so broad now as to have an unpredictable turn of events that have the potential to rape your mind and soul while you are passively entertained. Yea, we all wanted revenge, the rape scene as long and vivid as it was did not add to the hard justice delivered in the end and only demonstrates the level of depraved morality we are expected to believe."
1,Truly Garbage!!!!!,"hi, guys, give me a break! What are all these hypes for? This is one of the stupidest movie I have ever seen! The plot is too stupid to be believed. I will give it 0 star if I could. If you want to see anything disturbing, creepy, skip this movie!"
1,Gore porn nothing more.,"I should study a film more before I go out and buy it. Hey, it was only $10 at the store so I figured what the hey. This is just a dumb movie with no intellectual writing behind it, poor quality and poor acting, a soft core porn no doubt. I don't see how this film can be innovative at all. First of it's kind? Inspiration for many movies ahead of it? I think not. Many people who are in favor of this film point out the sociological perspective of the plot and how it represents a breakdown between cultures, but anyone who really understands the film will agree that it was made to be perverse and exploit, not to teach or innovative."
1,"""The Last House in the Toilet""","Oh come on, Pee Wee's Great Adventure was scarier than this! Pure garbage!!!It was pure cornball from beginning to end!"
3,:0(,It was ok-ish but i could have done (SPOILER) without the rape seen. nothing much to say about an ok-ish remake of a movie.
3,Mari 17 is dying....,"Remember the tag line for thisfilm Mari 17 is dying only for her the worst is yet to come... She lived in the ""Last House On The Left"". Keep repeating , ""Its only a movie"" I think the distributor also promised a registered nurse on duty in the lobby and vomit bags! FRESH!"
4,HORRIBLE AND SADISTIC!!!!! COOOOOL!!!!!!,"MAN! I loved this movie!I think that sexual horror films and horror documentaies are the most HORRENDOUS HORROR ever created by mankind!The movies these days no longer scare me or shock me! BECAUSE I ALREADY SEEN HELL ON THIS KIND OF MOVIES!! This film has RAPE, BLOOD, chainsaw kill, ripping body organs, REVENGE, gross stufs and MORE!! HAHAHA!!!The only thing that I didn't like about this film is the picture quality wich was very smudgy, but is clear enough to enjoy this DISTURBING HORROR!!! HAHAHA!!!P.S: Try also ""I Spit on your Grave"" wich is another masterpiece like this. You may think that Im sick but you forget that this is only a movie and horror is also a kind of art."
2,It's ONLY a Movie,"Back in 1972, the advertisment for this movie created a long line at our local drive in. The ad claimed to be so scary that to avoid fainting you had to keep repeating it's only a movie, it's only a movie. After it was over, we all felt cheated because the movie was not scary and did not make sense. Apparently, we saw an edited version back in '72. The new DVD has the restored version and lived up to it's orginal advertisement. I'm a fan of horror movies and not easily shocked but I had a hard time watching ""Last House on the Left"". The first part of the movie concerns the kidnapping, humiliation, tortue and brutal death of two teenage girls. The second part concerns the revenge exacted on the thugs who killed the girls. The brutality seems so real that it's difficult (for even jaded me) to be entertained. I'm giving it two stars because I can recognize it is well made but it's extremely difficult to watch; and being a gore hound/horror movie buff, that's saying alot."
1,not the last i'm afraid!!!,not just a sick movie but one that tries to pass it's self off as a tale of some greater meaning when mindless death and gore(i love gore movies as much as some other people do but this one is just sick) and really not worth anymore of mine(or yours) time!!!
1,Last movie on the shelf,"If you enjoy the torture, rape, humiliation, and slaying of two teenage girls by some escaped convicts, this movie is for you. This movie indeed crossed the boundaries, but I wouldn't exactly call it a horror movie. It felt more like a piece from the 6 O'clock evening news. The antagonists were just four regular people who were very extremely psychologically disturbed. If anyone out there has had a daughter who was ever abducted, raped, and killed, this is probably what it would have been like for her. The movie was in real poor taste. Sicko"
4,The Last House on the Left,"Amazon has the best selection of obscure movies, and this one tops the list. I believe it's Wes Craven's first movie, and definatly delivers on the gore. My parents watched it on their FIRST date, and I got them this for their anniversary, 30 years later........My dad still squirmed in his seat."
1,Kill me now!!!!!,"This had to be THE WORST horror or scary movie of all time. I have seen some bad movies in my time, but this one took the cake. I lost 2 hours of my life that I will never get back. I wouldn't give this movie a 1/2 star, but 1 star is the minimum. The cover looked pretty good and the online reviews were positive. One jackass even said it was the scariest movie they have ever seen. They were probably from Mayberry. The plot was horrible. The acting was worse. I really believe the person who ok'd the project was fired!! DO NOT SPEND MONEY on this movie. I made the mistake of buying the movie based on reviews.(ha,ha the joke was on me)"
2,No worse than...,"What is the deal with everyone saying disturbing? This was no worse than every other 70s/80s horror films. I was actually quite bored throughout this film. The most sickenly amusing scenes are in the beginning before they go in the woods. I kept expecting something utterly gruesome and terrible to happen. It never did, unless you consider rape (which really wasn't that graphic; never shows anything). I frankly hae seen worse by about twenty times. I'm not quite sure wh the controversy. Typical 70s film noire. Nothing more, nothin less."
3,Last House On The Left DVD review!,"Again with the case of any DVD review, I make it my point to review the DVD content, not the movie.If you are a collector looking for this long-lost classic, it is a great addition. You get the ""unrated"" version of the film along with director's commentary from Wes Craven himself and a few bonus featurettes. The movie itself is more intense than scary but it's still worth seeing if only for the fact that it was Craven's first film."
1,The Last House on the Left.(1972 Original),"Boring and amateurish and when it gets to the scenes it is sadistic,It seems it was made to ""Shock"",just plain garbage. the only good part is the END! Where finally there is some good of this dull yet sick movie."
2,Drama not Horror,"This movie has HORRIBLE acts in it, but it does not belong in the horror genre. It's more of a Drama I give it 3 stars for drama. You know what it is about already based on the hundreds of other reviews. I'm just going to say that it wasn't scary it was kind of just a thriller/drama. Sad kinda really. The music was odd to say the least. I think the movie had a lot of hidden meanings in it, poetic kind of. Don't buy this if you're looking for horror, it's just not in this movie. Yeah there are killings but...that doesn't make it a horror movie by default. This is a dramatic piece of...work."
1,Disappointing and disturbing...,"OK - now that I have ""disturbing"" in the title, you might think that obligated me to affirm that there is something substantial enough in this movie to warrant some kind of off-handed praise. But, no. Why this movie is in the horror category at all is beyond me. It was really just a long, drawn-out, and sad look at the rape and kidnapping of two girls. Not my idea of a good premise for a movie. And yes, I did read the reviews here - and some fans who argue that it symbolizes some kind of middle American nightmare of loss of innocence in the 1970s or whatever - those kinds of films aren't lost on me. This one was just completely un-scary, non-interesting, and devoid of any kind of film viewing pleasure at all.Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases. So, you'll want to look for other reviews and reviewers if that is what you are looking for..."
1,One of the worst movies of all time,"This 1972 attempt at a horror movie is painfully bad, a cinematic disaster on all levels. It is utterly boring, completely amateurish, and more likely to inspire annoyance than terror. It fails in every way. Even the music is totally inappropriate for a horror movie. It is far beneath any episode of ""Gilligan's Island""; yes, it's that bad! Anything currently available on your TV is better--including static."
1,Pretty Stupid,"Don't waste your time with this, be warned. It's so unrealistic that you'll find yourself muttering 'give me a break' every 10 minutes. The whole thing is very poorly written right up to the absurd ending. <spoiler> I couldn't take any more when towards the end the father winds up fighting the girl, that's the girl, and somehow not only gets overpowered but folds over like a potato chip until mommy bursts in to the save the day! One has to wonder if there's something in the water that's causing brain death in Hollywood writers, producers and directors."
2,This doesn't seem like a Craven film,"After hearing so much about this film, I came across it in a Blockbuster and rented it. I was somewhat disappointed with the film. The idea behind it is good, but it just didn't live up to the standards that people make it seem to have. The music is just, how do I put it, wrong. It simply doesn't fit. A hapy-pitched disco song during a chase through the woods? Come on, they could've done better than that. Overall, it's worth seeing once, and only worth renting, not buying."
4,Nice - gentle but thorough,"Half an hour, unusual combination of flowing moves and yoga. Good for a tired day, but you still work, and the posture side effects are great.Just don't get the other one - seven challenges to change your life. It's the same tape with bits cut out to make space for little films of Ms Goss dancing, Chinese calligraphy titles, and it's also jerky. (and no hint that it's the same tape...)"
3,Not Really a Direct Fit,This item is noted as a OEM direct fit. This is somewhat true but to make it work you need to purchase a tail pipe spout. The total when all is said and done exceeds the price of the muffler with the spout from your local retailer.
1,Not for Experienced Power Builder Programmer,This is book is not for Experienced Power Builder Programmer. I bought it and return the same day. And in this book nothing much about PB8 or Internet programming. This book is for person who wants to learn Power Builder not for Experienced Power Builder Programmer.
3,Ain't really necessary,"The game isn't too hard and is quite short, so the price tag is kind of high. The game is epic, but I don't know if the length justifies $70, that's all."
3,Eddie's Review,I'm new at this so I've got to get pass the learning curve to be give an inteligent review.
2,Definitely not a DASHMAT,"Does not fit around vents properly, does not lay flat. Have previously used DashMat with no problems. Also Charcoal is not Charcoal, it it Light Gray."
3,A decent compendium,"I picked this up at the library (it's non-circulating for some reason) to see whether I'd like to own it. After five minutes of scanning, I decided that I already knew most of the material. Some of the text seems as if it has been lifted directly from Mark Baker's ""Cops"" and Connie Fletcher's ""What Cops Know."" In fact, there are references to these books, both of which I highly recommend. There was, to be fair, a very detailed list of street names for crack, in case that's useful to you.""Cop Speak"" is a decent compilation of information from diverse sources, but there is very little in the book that you wouldn't learn from reading a few Elmore Leonard novels. Check it out before you buy it."
3,Useful,"I thought this was a timely gift for my girl-friends brother Derek as he descends further down his chosen life path. The book not only throw some light on the confusing code that is police `jive' but also provides an interesting look at the psyche of the law enforcement officer. The book is entertaining whilst still putting across vital information for those in frequent contact with cops. I'm sure Derek will find it helpful knowing such phrases as `giving a Rodney', which means its time for you to adopt the foetal position and pray."
1,Get real,"Oh puleaseee! Give me a break. Save your money. I was a police dispatcher, and this book is not some greatly awaited inside look into police vocabulary.Most of what cops really say cannot be put in print, and they sure as heck wouldn't put it there for liability purposes. Most agencies use code speak, and that varies from agency to agency. If you want to learn signal and ten code be prepared to memorize about 200 of 'em. 10-54 on this 10-26?"
3,Good reference book but not enough to pass the exam,"This book deals with old codes and neet to be updated to the current codes. I just took the PE exam and found that this book is missing many important information and the examples offered in the book are so simple. The book can eliminate several sections that most unlikely will see in the exam and at the same time add more important topics. The examples within each section need to be revised and become more difficult. Definetly, you will need another reference book with this one in order to pass the exam. I believe that this reference book in addition to ""Principles and Practice of Civil Engineering by Potter"" are good enough to pass the exam"
3,Ok minimal start on the subject,"This is a very light book on designing repeat patterns. There is a four-page description of repeat pattern types and figures to show you what they look like. The best part of the book doesn't come until page 33, where the author really gets into how to create your own repeat pattern. Between these two sections of the book are eight pages of flower and butterfly motifs you can cut out and practice with. The one chapter is good but I wanted more! and some discussion of creating designs in multi-colors.Don't pay any more than the $3.95 Amazon price for this one."
2,"I dig the charity, but no...","I happened to skim this book at my local bookstore, and I have to say I am unimpressed. The whole ""guess who"" thing is cliché, and the photographic talent (either technical or conceptual) for an art book just does not seem to be there. I know that the Sirota ""slice-of-life"" ads in the 80's were all the rage, but in a coffee table book like this, the work just falls flat. Perhaps Ms. Sirota is a bit long in the tooth for this kind of work, and should stick to ads for mayonnaise, soap, or whatever. I did like the creamy paper, but I have to wonder how much money that paper and binding choice took away from the AIDS project... Does Ms. Sirota have a brother or something? The previous review seems to be written by a professional cheerleader, and can't be for real."
3,IT was a pretty good book.,"This book was pretty good, but it did not keep you hanging off the edge of your seat. I think it helped you catch up on the characters and help you get to know yhem better. It also gave a little more detaile about what is happening in the world around them."
4,This is a kewl book!,"This is a really kewl book. I liked it alot. It is really easy to understand. The only thing i didn't like is that i think the authors should give you more of the bible verses that were used in this book because i would like to read the verses. Also, i think that the book is good for any age, not just 9-12. I really don't know any 9-year-olds who could understand the book. I'm 14, and i like the kids books a lot more than the adult books, because they're a lot easier to understand, less characters. So, if you haven't read Nicolae high, you need to. These books have changed a lot of people's lives and made them get saved."
2,Worst of them all!,I am a big fan of the left behind series. But this book was a major disappointment. I think you should skip this book and read the rest.It just drags on and on and on.
5,A collaboration of easy to make and great tasting meals.,What makes this cookbook stand out among the rest is the combination/selection of full menus provided (including wine and calorie count for each meal). The recipes are easy to follow and the ingredients can easily be found at your local grocer. (No hunting required for exotics). I highly recommend this book for the novice and experienced chef. All will enjoy a great culinary experience .
3,"I wanted a cookbook, not a diet book!","I like the recipes in this book, but I got really irritated with the constant calorie counting, low-fat, 'a TINY bit of meat as a SPECIAL treat' tone. I bought this book because Pepin's a great cook, not a great dietician. And let's be honest, after years of low-fat this and that, America's not getting any thinner. I suppose that's what it takes to keep people watching your TV show, but I'd have preferred him to say 'this is what I like to eat, and use common sense as to how much and how often you eat any particular dish' - as the lady who wrote 'The Cook and the Gardener' did in her introduction. America treats food like a chemistry lesson - I'm sad to see Pepin going along. That said, his recipes are good basic ideas, but I'll tinker with them a bit before using them."
3,Good...But...,"Okay, so far, I'm the only one who's given less than 5 stars on this book and I feel fairly alone as a dissenting voice. However, I've got a sizeable collection of cookbooks (30+) and this is one of the least opened. Why? Certainly not because of the recipes. They taste just fine. It just doesn't have the same zip as some of the newer cookbooks which have equal content but their presentation is much better, IMHO.I really wish I could give this book more stars, but maybe Mr. Pepin needs to do some updating of his material in this particular work. It's not that there's something wrong with it, it's just that it could be better."
3,"Good overview of the basics, but is missing some topics","This book is great for getting started or for basic review of information that you may have learned at one time and have since forgotten. However, it falls short in the level of coverage. For example, it doesn't cover power series (solutions about ordinary points and solutions about singular points), and the degree of difficulty of the problems is very low (at least by comparison to those in my differential equation class for which I was using this book as a suppliment)."
4,Perfect supplement for any diff intro course,"I bought this book at the beginning of my first semester of differential equations, and found it very useful. It was a very good resource to back up my text, and explained things a little bit different so you end up getting a better perspective on the different methods and stradagies. In fact, my classmates, after continuously wanting to lood at my book, finally went out and bought there own!"
4,"Practice, Practice , Practice Problems","If you need a helpful outline with lots of solved practice problems to learn Differential Equations, this is your book!"
3,It's okay,It soo fan I think that how is mike this is to smart it's amizeng thak you so mutch my blager to have this but the baebor is not very good I think
4,Good Book,The book gave enough hints to solve a lot of complex problems. It's a good guide for it shows the student where to start.
4,Really Nice,"This book is quite useful at times. I am taking a Differential Equations course and so far it as helped me out in this sometimes tricky subject. Although it has left out a few things that are in my textbook, I would recommend it for anyone that needs a little help with the process of solving problems."
1,Too Many Missing Steps,"I am working on Chapter 16, there is no title for the chapter and there are no steps to show you how to do the problems. So, I have spent 3 hours on example 1, and still no idea how to do it. I am getting an A in my differentials class (99% on the first test, 92% on the second), but there are no steps at all on any of the problems so I am stuck, and I can't find any help online because there is no title to the chapter and no wording put in Google, so nothing - worst book, many of the chapters are missing steps. I only have a few hours to figure this out before getting to class, so I'll get back to my guessing at the steps."
4,great graphic,"graphic is very bright and stands out, fabric wicks away moisture well. sizes run small, may want to buy one size larger then you normally buy."
1,Does not fit! Too small,I have a standard 48 x 72 goal and this won't fit. I bought this as a Christmass present for my son and he is very dissapointed. Hopefully I can send it back. Do not buy this unless you have an undersized goal.
2,too small,"Looks like it would last awhile, since it is pretty thick. The velcro straps look substantial enough to take some abuse. But, if you have an official size goal 4' x 6'...it won't fit. Although it said on the package that it ""fits most 4'x6' goals"". My goal is a pretty common 4'x6' goal and the target is good 6"" too narrow. I guess it must be made overseas and someone there didn't convert their metric system to inches correctly."
4,South of Heaven,"This book was about high school at the end of the twentieth century. A Largo High there's a program called GOALS, where teachers reach out to the students that try to escape school. It describes several students that attend Largo High and what they do outside of school. This book is great when it came to details.My favorite character in this book was Christine Younskevicius, everybody calls her YY. She had three close friends that she was always hanging out with. YY was very involved in school, and everybody knew her at Largo High.I enjoyed reading this book. It was long but worth it. When I was reading it, it felt like I was there watching or listening to what was happening. Those are the kind of books that I personally enjoy reading. This book caught my attention from the very beginning."
2,2 SLOW!!!,This book moves EXTREMELY slow. bY the 4th chapter I threw the book at the wall and went to sleep.
1,Guyia Winfrey...,"well then thats just YOU,miss guyia. i buy my own books,so if i buy them, i read them and then give them to someone else. Comprende?"
4,Who is the Prince Child?,"The lyrical desriptions of the animals and their presents and the beautiful illustrations, bringing each of them into focus, make one almost tremble in anticipation as to what the grand prince will be like. Children will love to analyze each character and their gift for the prince. The surprising ending gives a nice twist to the story."
1,DOES NOT WORK AT ALL....LOSS OF MONEY,I bought this product and I must say that when I spray my bed at night it may keep the bedbugs away but not for long. This is a totally waste of money. You are going to have to spend money on an exterminator. I didn't want to do it either but you are better off trust me.
3,works a bit.,"not as good as i had hoped but still worked somewhat. maybe my expectations were a bit to high? i dunno. but this helped with a lice infestation so, it's all good."
2,"organic is great, but did not perform","I am really excited by and committed to using organic products. However, this product did not work as an insect eliminator as it claimed."
5,Fleas no more.,"Despite it being pricey, this product delivers. In addition to taking some other recommended precautions to avoid flea exposure and population, we have used this product through 2 summers and no fleas. We no longer use toxic flea collars and medications any more for our 2 cats and one dog. It is a great overall house cleaner and a necessity if you are going to implement the total flee eradication process which includes the use of this product on floors and bedding and nematodes in the yard."
4,allergy free,This product helps you control the insects that you can not see that some of us are very allergic too. Thank you for creating a product that controls these and that can be used on the human body without causing a bigger irratitation.
2,naturally worth a try,"I was interested in this product because we have bed bugs to get rid of and the product is made from natural ingredients, no chemicals. I could tell right away that it had vinegar in it. I think vinegar acts as a repellant to bed bugs but does not kill them. I sprayed the carpet and our bedding and floor boards. I regret to say we still have bed bugs so we must move on to other methods."
1,Very poor quality,I pour the liquid on the bed bugs and then 2 mins later they r walking and running . It's like giving them an energy drink or something. I sprayed so many times but didn't kill single bed bug.my best suggetion put everything outside in sun let it sit for 3 to 4 hrs and use bed bug sand for the floor.
2,No obvious effect for scabies control,"After months battling but could not clean out the scabies, I purchased it and used it in tub, spray. Also applied the concentrated solution to the skin where is infected. It does not seem help. At the same time, we had adopted many other medicines for killing the mites but could not clean it out after weeks.It is quite expensive. Also, let it dry on infected skin is very uncomfortable."
1,The picture is missleading,I bought this product under the assumpliton that I would receive 3 bottles. The picture is missleading.
1,tiny little hole in the bottle.,It arrived half bottle empty with small tiny hole in the bottle. What a waste of money.....I want my money back!!!!!!!!
2,Must be used appropiately....,"If you have biting mites, as I had, as a result of all the feral cats in my area...this stuff is great when applied directly to the scalp, or anywhere else on the skin.... but if you want to get RID of dust mites, biting mites, or bedbugs, then use diatomaceous earth, and pronto....they work!..."
4,Safe bug killer,No more bed bugs. It took a week before I notice a reduction. I also used this on roaches. It doesn't kill on contact. The smaller bugs die within 20 seconds. The larger ones have time to run away and hide. Which is good. They can carry it back to their nest. It has a mild organic smell. It will leave a sticky film if you don't wipe after spraying. I bought 2 more bottles for the rest of the house.
1,Do not waste your money...,"I ordered a gallon of this stuff - what a waste. It smells VERY strongly of vinegar - I mean really bad. The price is outrageous - you can buy much better smelling ""enzymes"" at the pet store for 1/3 the price - and they are just as effective. I used Pet Force - it actually smells nice and was $24 per gallon. They are used for removing pet odors but work as well, smell much better and are cheaper. This product is a rip-off..."
5,CLEANS EVERYTHING! EXCELLENT!,"This product was purchased to prevent bed bugs, when I heard that neighbors had the problem. I found that it is an EXCELLENT CLEANER -- everything from soap scum/mold on shower curtains & ""grout"" -- to stains on clothes, carpet, show curtains (anything!) -- it lifts it off with minimal scrubbing. Excellent product! It was delivered promptly -- use it diluted or full-strength -- no harsh odors, and no skin reactions. I will KEEP THIS IN STOCK IN MY HOUSE."
2,"Yucky, and doesn't work.",Just doesn't do what it promises and has a vinegar smell (which I wouldn't care about at all if product worked). Doesn't even work well as a cleaner.
3,It kills them doesn't prevent them,"While this product did in fact kill the bed bugs, it did not prevent them from returning. I used this along with JT Eaton 203 and they didn't get the job done. My children and I are getting ready to move and will not be bringing any of our mattresses or bedding with us and will be sure to thoroughly clean EVERY thing before moving into a new place. It's a shame to spend money on so many different products to have to purchase 3 new mattresses...plus the bedding."
4,Works well if you make your own mix,"The products work well but the problem is you can't dilute it like the directions say. I used it and i loved it. It doesn't burn, it doesn't smell, i have three kittens and I felt safe having them around while I cleaned. With other products it was hassle getting them in another room.This is a great product if you are wanting to be green-friendly and it lasts forever."
1,This is NOT a pesticide...IT IS a very expensive Lysol...,"I bought this for $50 (with shipping) from Amazon to help with bed bug problems. The description in Amazon is VERY misleading. The label on the bottle says nothing about killing pests!!! It even says it is ""not a pesticide"". It is a cleaning product. What a rip-off...this is false advertising. After spraying, I saw a bed bug pass through it like it was nothing. BUYERS BE WARNED!!!"
1,Total scam...,"It appears to be nothing more than dish soap and vinegar. It does clean well, but does not do what the heading states. Also did not come with any directions."
4,its worth a spin...,get this last...start with danzig 2 then get 1 and 3...buy this last if you like the others. i like this one the least buts its still ok. 4 stars is a compliment really. with tracks 13-65 being nothing but dead air time seems kind of pointless just so the final read on your cd plaer will read like this 66 (for track 66) and the time is 61 minutes and 38 seconds. so ur cd player sais this 66 61:38. 666 mark of the beast? and 138 his misfits song? coincidence? i dont see how it could be.
2,"ok album, but needs more original-type stuff on it","If u are first starting to like danzig, buy the first 3 albums first because they are way better. Danzig 4 is probbably one of the worse albums of danzig."
2,Ok but not really that fascinating,it was ok nothing more than that though. I would not recommend it to other naturalist friends of mine. Just okay!
1,Outdated! Intermediate Level Skills Required. Poor.,"I needed a up-to-date, simple to follow DVD to show me how to install a WordPress Blog in December of 2010 - what I got was a DVD produced in someone's basement in 2008. The guys speaks at an intermediate level. They aren't even using a licensed version of the screencast software to produce the video. There is a watermark over the entire video that says, ""to remove this nagging message, buy a licensed version."" Very disappointed!Lesson learned . . . don't by a DVD that has zero ratings.Now you know, save your cash for some other program that actually has ratings. I'm waiting on another one I found on Amazon with pretty good user comments.Good luck in all your web endeavors."
2,Hannibal,"Victor Mature's Hannibal was the first drive-in movie I ever saw, about 1960. My recollections of the original was that the film was bigger than life. This digitalized version was nowhere near as panoramic."
3,A relic from the past,"I saw this movie at a drive-in as a 10 year old child and was excited to see it released on DVD. All I remembered was the elephants crossing the Alps in the snow. Seeing it for the first time that is probably all you will remember as well. Yet it is enjoyable enough, even if not the most spectacular of spectacles. The print is uneven-clear and sharp colors at times, at others, washed out and grainy. The acting is definitely B movie as is the dialog. But it still is nice to see that someone thought enough of this movie to bring it out on DVD for another generation to see and say ""They don't make 'em like this anymore"". Good or bad, they don't make movies like this anymore but it's nice to watch it and remember a time when they did."
2,Hannibal,Watch it and make you own option. I think this would have been a great movie for the drive-in back in the day.
2,not quiet at all,"Don't buy this fan if you are looking for a quiet one for bedroom. Maybe I'm just in bad luck, but mine is really noisy."
1,Horrible company,"Product which was probably already returned to the company was shipped without hardware. One error after another. The customer rep, Rita Moss, was rude and obnoxious to me, actually yelled at me. What a nusiance. Totally not worth it. Buy from another company or deal with the headache that follows."
2,Not worth the price,"This product does nor circulate enough air to cover even a small room, and in addition, the base is not sturdy enough. I tried it for about 10 minutes and decided this product was not for me. It is not worth the price."
2,Not what I expected.,I went by the good reviews of this product and decided to order it. It did not make a dent in the heat. I had to go out and by another old fashion oscillating fan to get some cool air flowing.
1,Designed by idiots,"I should have read the negative reviews more closely. To save a few pennies they designed this to fit in a smaller box, therefore requiring frustating assembly by the user. The screws do not fit! That is if you are lucky enough to find the three tiny screws in a tiny bag in the box. I bought two, the first one was impossible to assemble, not only were the screws inadequate, but the power cord did not fit within the base. After an hour I gave up and packed it for return, very difficult becase there is way too much packaging (very unfriendly to user and our planet).Instuctions are inadequate for assembly. Perhaps if they used bigger illustrations and somebody who speaks English to write them, it might be better.The second assembled as designed, but is still wobbly on its stand because the base assembly is too flimsy for the height and weight of the unit.Do not buy this, the second one is going back as soon as our heat spell is over.."
1,delivered broken,"Not sure how this product would have worked because it arrived broken. It seemed cheaply made, but what do you expect for $20."
2,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR:,"YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR; After writing a review of this ""fan""that stated this is only a fan, one that at best may provide some cooling for a bathroom sized room. It is merely a fan, not a cooler. Since writing that review I am receiving phone calls, late at night, early morning, FROM THE COMPANY THAT SHIPPED THE FAN, AND NOT AT MY REQUEST. THIS MUST STOP. THEY INSIST I REQUESTED THESE CALLS. THIS IS HARASSMENT. IT MUST STOP. THIS IS ONLY A FAN ON TOP OF A PLASTIC TOWER, NOT ANYTHING AS INDICATED BY THOSE WHO WROTE GLOWING REVIEWS, UNLESS THEY WERE REFERRING TO THEIR TOOL SHEDS. P.J.Today"
3,meets my needs = 3 stars,"PROS: easy to assemble, moves air well, and requires a small footprint.CONS: Too noisy for the bedroom. Wobbles a little when it oscillates, especially at the highest speed.NOTE: I have 2 dogs, and neither has become tangled in the oscillator base. So, for others who read the review that reported it, I don't understand how that could happen. My dogs are about 50# each, one with long hair."
4,Tower Fan,Fan has three speeds and works well to circulate the air around the room. A good buy for the money.
4,fan,"Great for the price. Gives good amount of air circulation. Would have given it a 5, except the tower is a bit wobably, however, it does not effect its functionality."
2,Not quite what I expected,While this fan was as small as I imagined I thought it would move more air.
2,noisy after several days of using,"low price but not very high quality. becomes very noisy when used for a few days -- noise coming from the inside axis, not the dock.not recommend this product."
4,Does the job for me.I,I bought the fan for on top of a speaker in my living room. The room is not that big and is connected to the dining room so it does a good job for me. I always run it on low the higher speeds are too noisy. I'm very sensitive to sound.
1,WARNING!! IF YOU HAVE PETS!!!,"I have had several tower fans and I have to say that this is the WORST fan I have ever owned. It hardly puts out the air and most important~~My pets like to lay close to the fans in the summertime and I know that you should not allow them to lay close to a fan, but with all my other tower fans, there was no problem because they have a small stand on them. This one does not. I learned after my dog almost choked to death, that it seems to twist and trap the pets fur on the bottom and they cannot get out. We had to cut all of his fur to get him out of the fan.If you have pets DO NOT DO NOT purchase this fan. If you leave them unattended, you might come home to a horrible nightmare!Just warning people!!! Small children even might get caught in this thing."
3,Nice tower fan if you can take the surging,"I sent the first fan I received back because it would surge when running. I thought there was a problem with it, but I guess this is normal? The second fan I received did the same thing. This annoys my husband to no end, but some how I find it soothing and I fall right to sleep to it(I only use it at night for the backround noise). I like that it is a great space saver, not big and bulky like the typical fan."
5,Smooth and Quiet,"Another super affordable fan. It's durable (our toddler likes to knock it over), it's quiet, and it's a perfect amount of air moving for a bedroom or living room."
1,Dead after 3 Months,"While this fan provided some cooling my bedroom for the first few months, it eventually died. The rotation still works but the fan is presumed dead. Be aware it may fail."
4,Quiet and effective,This fan has helped to keep my family cool during a recent heatwave with no AC. It is the quietest fan I have owned--far quieter than the circular desktop fans that we use. At night we actually had to turn it down to low in our bedroom because it got too chilly with the strong airflow. It's well worth the money. I'm about to order another one.
5,"So quiet, and doesn't wobble at all.","easy to put together. follow the directions and then insert the 3 screws. not sure who can be confused by this process. this fan doesn't wobble in the least. pushes a lot of air and is very stylish. noise is nonexistent. like it more than my previous fan which was the Honeywell Fresh Breeze Tower Fan with Remote Control. a lot of people couldn't figure out how to work the thermostat on that one. this fan is simple, stylish, and keeps a small room cool."
3,WELL DID NOT REALIZE,"WELL I FAILED TO REALIZE THIS IS A SUPER DUPER SHORT FAN . NO REMOTE .U'D HAVEE TO PUT IT ON TOP OF A CHAIR FOR IT TO DO ANYGOOD AT ALL, ITS SO SHORT. I HAVE NOT USED IT YET. I SHOULD HAVE LOOKED MORE INTO THE HEIGHTH OF IT AND IT HAS NO REMOTE, LIKE THE OTHER FIVE TOWER FANS I HAVE. OH WEL."
3,"good for a bedroom, not for a living room","It's easy to assemble & runs very quietly. The air current is strong enough to keep a bedroom cool, but I didn't feel any air movement at all when I tried it in the living room. For smaller rooms it's okay, but I wouldn't buy it if you were trying to cool a larger area."
1,Noisy and a Bad purchase,"I bought this fan after reading the reviews and comments. It was given a 4 star. But it is not even 15 days that I bought and it has started making noise. Since I had thrown the box and the bill, I am unable to return it. I wouldnt recommend this to anyone."
5,nice for a room and quiet,"love it, just enough air for a single bedroom, and its not a jet engine sound.I have bought 3 so far, and buying one more."
3,Good product but the screws were missing,"This is a really good fan for the price one's paying. It works well, isn't very noisy and good for cooling small rooms. The only issue I had with this fan was that the screws used to attach the fan to its stand were missing. Upon contacting the customer care they offered to reimburse or exchange it. I found it too cumbersome to send the whole package (btw the packaging is huge) back and wait for a new one. So I bought the screws in a hardware shop for about a dollar. If it wasn't for the missing screws I probably would have given it 5 stars."
4,Great Product,"This product works great. I have it in my kids room, and they have knocked it over several times, and it is still working great. I would buy this product again."
2,oscillating fan,"I had the fan for about a week, and it started to make a ""knocking noise""...although it continued to cool. I checked the base and it was installed correctly. Finally called the company, and I would have to send it back. They would then send a replacement. But I no longer had the boxes that it came in, and the cost of sending it back would have been almost 1/2 the cost of the fan. So, I kept it..and it continues to make the knocking noise.This is the first item that I have purchased thru Amazon, with which I have been unhappy."
5,Magnificent Thinking,"Thanks for the wonderful preview of the this book. It is clear and to the point. I am so excited about reading the entire book and can't wait to get it. I'm glad to know these men were great givers as well as receivers. I know now to ask myself the question, ""What am I willing to give up, in return for receiving my desires?"" You should not violate the rights of others to accomplish your desires. I'm glad to know that faith in a Supreme Being (mine is God) is included as a part of one of the daily habits under the Definiteness of Purpose ten-point personal traits. And to my family......working with others in a ""spirit of harmony"" is so very vital in order to achieve success!"
5,Works great.,I have been looking for a low-profile card for a while now. This fit the bill just fine.
2,"Lamson Sharp 8"" x 3"" Jumbo Fish Turner",I was very disappointed at the flimsy construction of this spatula. I do not feel it would last very long with regular use. I cook a lot of salmon and this spatula needs to be heavier the handle will probably bend with very much weight.
5,Works great!,This light kills the algae in our pond. It makes the water crystal clear so I can enjoy my fish. The price was very reasonable.
4,"Better recording than ""Letter to Evan"" - but still not very good","This live recording at Ronnie Scott's in London was made 12 days after ""Letter to Evan"" in 1980, yet the piano still has a few keys out of tune - at least high G-sharp (heard clearly on track 4 1:45), high G (heard clearly on track 6 5:22)and high C (heard clearly on track 7 :32). You would think someone would have noticed. It is very grating on tracks 5 and 7.At least the drums seem to be less distorted when he plays with sticks. The performance is very good."
5,Worth the wait,"I've wanted to get my hands on this session for years. Not only rumored to be some of Ponty's best work (before Zappa, synthesizers, and the mechanization of the artist) but one of the most spirited, innovative, unique B-3 sessions on record (Eddy Louiss). The recording exceeds expectations--in both musical and audio quality. How Louiss' ever got his ax into this small Paris cave defies comprehension, but the sound it produces is some of the most stirring Hammond on record--constant dynamic contrasts in the use of stops and voices, on and off Leslie effects throughout, and bass lines strong enough to make most bass players ponder. Makes me wish I could trade in the parlor piano for a B-3.As for Ponty, he finally shows why he was once called the ""Bird of the fiddle."""
5,"Packed with useful info, read it more than once!","Every single page of this book has tons of useful information. No complaints about this book at all, every photographer going into business should read this book. Great info for any kind of photographer, not just photographers with a physical studio. He goes through everything business related: equipment, pricing, portrait/wedding/commercial, financial planning, and even posing guides!"
5,dog-eared from rereading it!,"This is a really good book if you're trying to start or enhance a portrait and/or wedding photography career. It is aimed primarily at those trying to start a portrait studio, and there migh be better wedding-oriented books. But since that's my core business, it hit the nail on the head. Lots of good insights and tips, and I have quite a few page corners turned down for later reference. I recommend placing the book in the bathroom, so you can hone your photography business and marketing skills on a regular basis!"
5,More than 5 starts for sure,"Get this book if you're thinking of starting a photography business. It has been an invaluable resource and an excellent jump start. We wouldn't be near as successful had I not read this book and put into practice most of what I learned. Although some of it is just smart business practices, most of it is sound advice from someone who's been there. Excellent, excellent book."
4,Good book to learn the business of photography,"This book takes a hands on approach and is very informative. Most of the book details various scenarios of setting up and running a photo business, using the authors past businesses as a model. I found most of the information quite helpful, but wished that there was more detail on the actual set up of the studio (ie equipment, rent/lease etc). But all in all I would recommend this book to anyone interested in starting (or improving) a photo studio. I really liked the personal point of view of the writing and the author doesn't pull any punches, he tells it like it is. It's a tough business, but it can be done."
3,was hoping for more,"I was dissapointed that the author mainly discussed wedding photography. I understand this is the bread & butter of the business, but the book should have therefore been titled: ""How to Start & Run a Wedding Photography Business."" If you are looking for info on starting other types of photography studios, you may be better suited to look elsewhere."
5,Great Resource.,Easily the best recommendation for starting a photography service. Contains great advice and samples of documents needed to run a studio. Read it twice and then keep it on the handiest shelf.
5,Engrossing and Lovely,"Pamela's inspirational romance ""with an edge"" is a lovely, fast-paced read that satisfies on many levels. Two talented, headstrong people, repeatedly clash and resist the growing attraction between them. Worldly, rancher Craig and innocent, resident vet, Tamara can't resist the explosive chemistry between them for long. When Tamara is critically injured, Craig's protective nature and deep love for Tamara surface. But she has been emotionally damaged in the past and Craig's intense assault of her senses with one passionate kiss has Tamara fleeing the ranch to return home and face the past on her own. This is a deeply moving story of loss, reconciliation, healing and the immense God-given gift of love. Pamela writes sensual romance that is at the same time, sweet and tasteful. I highly recommend this novel to general romance readers and inspirational romance readers alike. Beautifully written."
2,BEWARE - These new pumps are made in China - Noisy under back pressure,"Let me start by saying I love maxijet pumps. However these newer ones are now made in China. This may or may not make a difference to some people but here is the issue I came across. I use this pump to feed a reactor for my fishtank. Normally I use a ball valve to throttle down the flow to keep my carbon from grinding itself down to powder. With the old style pump this was no problem, I could dial it back and it would work as quietly as it did unrestricted. With the new style pump made in China the machining process must be a little more laxed or something as ANY back pressure at all makes these pumps rattle horribly!Be aware of this issue if you plan on using this pump to feed a reactor, or skimmer or anything else that might cause some back pressure. The noise will drive you crazy!"
1,"Homza's work is choppy, incomplete, inaccurate.","I am very familiar with the material discussed in this work, and Homza's interpretations of history are not at all accurate. She completely underemphasizes the brutality of the Spanish Inquisition and, instead, portrays the process as ""enlightened upholding of social norms."" Furthermore, her writing style is choppy and has no flow. It reads something like an old telegram [stop] I was greatly anticipating this work, as it deals with a pet subject of mine, but Homza really failed to live up to my expectations. I hope she is better at teaching than she is at writing."
5,Keef is hilarious!,"I really love the K Chronicles, and this and Fear of A Black Marker are terrific - funny, insightful, brilliant, pretty much everything you want in a comic book!"
1,"Sorry, I can't do any better than 1 star","Somehow this book showed up on my daughters bookshelf. I have no idea how it got there. The book is so poorly written it's not even laughable. It's actually quite sad. The fact that it rhymes but doesn't flow rhythmically makes it an incredibly awkward read. Then, just as you start to this that this HAD TO BE written by an 8 year old, he rhymes ""way"" with ""anyway"" and then you just roll your eyes.The thoughts are totally random, there is no flow, and the structure is just plain bad.Sorry Billy. Don't quit your day job."
2,Gorgeous illustrations; mediocre writing,"The pictures and the idea of this book are great, but it totally falls short in the writing. Mr. Crystal needs to head back to high school for a course in rhyme scheme and rhythm. A lot of the lines are forced and awkward to read - mediocre, at best. Case in point:""I have the feeling that you understand everything I say,like granpa boo boo lee doo, la la la la la lay.""Uhm, yeah. Lines like that make me wonder if Mr. Crystal just scribbled out some half thought-out lines just to see if his book would sell based on his name alone.The only redeeming quality that this book has is the beautiful collection of illustrations by Guy Porfirio. I make up my own words and just show the pictures to my little one."
4,Perfect first birthday gift!,"AS a first-time grandfather to a granddaughter, when I saw this book three months after my granddaughter was born, I knew I had to have it come her first birthday. Luckily, Amazon had it, while local booksellers didn't. I don't care how well it's written. I don't teach English. What I love is that it captures much of our first year together, it's from me (unlike Grandma usually buying stuff for her), the pictures are great, and she can snuggle up on my lap while I read it to her, changing the words to personalize it even more to fit just the two of us. Billy Crystal did a great job capturing in words and pictures what I can't. I hope this special gift for my beautiful granddaughter will help her know in the years to come just how special she is to her grandpa! I'm betting she'll focus on that and not if the rhyme is forced (per another reviewer). Grandpa DR"
2,"A lot of information, but not very well presented..","James Achord certainly gives out a lot of information in his 132 or so page book on Hepatitis, but he certainly could have presented the information a bit better. There is a lot of medical jargon in this book, and it is sometimes hard to follow. He also doesn't diagram well, but it does have the essentials of understanding all forms of the disease."
5,EXCELLENT TEXT,I used this book as a supplement to my main text for a graduate level course in colloids and surface physical chemistry. It was by far one of the best texts to use for this area. It makes things easier to understand without all the math in some other texts. Excellent.
4,"Losses, family, relationships","Surprisingly well-done movie. The trailer give a very brief overview of the plot line but, fortunately it did not spoil the significant details which made the movie-watching much more satisfying. The movie, as I see it, does not have a significant climax and resolution. It felt more like we, as audience, had a good peek into Tyler(Robert P)'s life at a very dark time of his life. The plot line is fairly predictable yet the movie kept me watching. Robert P's performance was not bad at all. Based on his performance in the movie, he proves that he will not remain to be just another handsome actor who plays the romancer of the leading ladies."
4,Remember Me,"First of all I will be honest and admit my only reason for watching this film was because it stars Robert Pattinson (Edward from Twilight.) But now I know that even if it didn't, it would still be a worthwhile film to see. It deals with serious issues, and tells the story of Tyler whose parents are divorced, and whose dad has provided everything materially, but has never been there emotionally for him or his younger sister. Tyler is somewhat reckless, who lets his temper get the best of him at times, which ultimately gets him into trouble. It deals with family tragedy, the bullying of his little sister at school, his falling in love, and just basically his relationships with everyone he knows. It makes you think, and realize to value the time you have with those you love. I recommend seeing it."
4,I'm STILL crying,"I just saw this movie last night, and this morning, I suddenly burst into tears just remembering it. The characters are all so relate-able, they draw you in and i think everyone can identify with one or more of them. The ending totally shocked me since i had not read ANY type of review, I figured *something* would happen to *someone* but I couldn't imagine the magnitude they used.Ruby Jerins is brilliant as Caroline, the slightly shy and awkward but incredibly talented 11 year old artist. She was the main link to humanity for Tyler in my opinion.See it."
4,Remember Me,This movie is saddening and uplifting at the same time. Pierce Brosnan truly stood out in this movie. This movie will get your attention the very first ten minutes. Pattinson proved he can beat out his twlight role. This movie is very emotional and will affect everyone differently. Very watchable.
3,Sweet Movie,I was encouraged to watch this movie based on the reviews. While I wouldn't say it was one of the best movies I've ever seen. I will say it was moving in a quiet and unexpected way.
3,Shocking Ending,"I did not see this coming. The ending was really surprising to me because I had not really heard anything about this movie. I'm a kind of ""happy ever after"" gal so I was a little disappointed - but there was also a wonderful element at the ending. (Trying not to give the ending away.) It was a very good movie and now that I know the ending can watch it again and further appreciate and understand the lives of many of the characters. Well-done! It was really more of a 3.5 to 3.75 for me."
4,Acted Well - Poor story line,RP did a credible job with what he had to work with.This is not the type movie I enjoy.Bought the movie specifically to see RP act as somethingother than a vampire------I am a fan of the Twilight Series.
5,Great role for Rob Pattinson,"Rob Pattinson was wonderful and very believable in this movie. I went to New York in 2002, when there was still a lot of pain everywhere, and I thought the events of 9/11 were handled very thoughtfully. Critics seem to have a hard time giving the Twilight cast a break. That being said, I've read many complimentary articles about Rob's portrayal of Tyler and I agree with them all. If you haven't seen this movie you're missing something."
5,This movie will hit your Heart!,"If you love Robert, and you like surprise endings....This movie is for you! I will not spoil it.I saw this in the theater when it came out in March, and I was crying so much at the end, I waited for the theater to clear before I left. Don't mistake this for me not liking the movie, It was great! Highly recommended."
2,Won't Remember This Movie,"Some decent acting, but I found myself not involved witht the characters. Their actions seem plot driven rather than coming from consistant internal forces. The ending seemed contrived. I must say, I enjoyed the movie more when non-whining adults were present in the scene."
2,Love Robert but the movis is just bad,"Thin ,unbelievable story. Robert Pattinson is a fantastic actor , he needs to get movies like Twilight . Movies that show his romantic side that is what we love from him"
3,Remember Me Disappointing,"I watched this as I am a fan of The Twilight Series and i am not a kid...in my 50's..It irks me that everyone says Twilight is for kids...as lots of older people like it too...anyway...The ending of this ruined the whole movie...it is confusing..and one wonders ""what happened?"" untill finally figured out what must have happened to him..They could have used actual footage of that event and made a clearer and better impact on the film...The story line was not well developed also...I like Pierce Bronson but in this i did not like him at all...Robert comes across as a spoilt kid who doesn't like having a wealthy Dad..but I did like the parts he defended his little sister...it could have been better though.."
5,AWESOME,This movie is awesome. Didn't expect the ending. Everyone should watch this movie. One of my favorites. Robert is great!
4,"Compelling drama, forced dialogue","Overall, the acting in this movie is pretty compelling. It really tugs a lot of emotional strings. The plot goes from one tragedy to the next, until the surprising finale. Robert Pattinson is the only exception - he seemed like he was trying too hard. The dialogue often sounded too forced, particularly during the confrontational scenes. I kept thinking, who really talks like that? Nonetheless, it's an entertaining movie if you like dramas and pretty well done."
3,Good to see him in a human role,"It was predictable, but still funto watch and my Granddaughter did really enoy the story and the people. It's good."
5,The film touched me in more ways than one,"I'm glad I didn't read the critical reviews before I saw this film or else it would've spoiled the end for me. While the preview plot is nothing surprising (boy makes a bet to make a girl fall for him, trying to outsmart overzealous cop), the relationship between Robert Pattinson's character and his little sister was what I found fascinating. I liked the dynamics between those two and the struggled love between the two siblings and their father, Pierce Brosnan's character. While I was certainly surprised by the turn of events and my heart cracked a little after a slumber party incident, I cheered about the fire extinguisher spot. As far as the end, I didn't see that one coming. This movie was nothing like I expected it to be, and I enjoyed it for that reason. While Robert Pattinson has the same sex appeal in this movie as he does in the ""Twilight"" series, my eyes kept resting on Pierce. I'd seen him in other films, but in this one, he was extremely handsome."
4,wonderful movie,I usually figure out the ending midway through a movie but this movie ending totally surprised me. My daughter and I sat in shock wondering how we did not figure it out so we watched a second time - the clues were there but so subtle we missed them. We really enjoyed this movie - drama with humor.
4,Remember Me - Enjoyable,After seeing Twilight which I enjoyed I wanted to see Robert Pattinson in a different movie. This is also a love story but has some funny moments.There is also a few issues with in their families. Some very sad moments. The other actors in this movie are well known.They come together very well to make this a good movie.I have shown this to a number of my friends and they are in agreement it is a must have movie.Hopeless romantic
5,Remember Me....how can you not?!!!,"I reluctantly watched this movie. I didn't hear about the ending. I thought it would be dark drama so I was hesitant about even watching it. I'm SO glad I did. As the movie went on, you kept watching because all of the characters were interesting and stuck to you. You wanted to see how it ended. The ending...I won't spoil it for everyone but the last 5 minutes makes the whole movie worth it. I never ""see"" the credits usually, but I was so shocked at the ending that the credits rolled all the way through before I shut the DVD off. WOW!!!! Worth a watch or several watches!!!"
4,Very good - unexpected!,"It was a refreshing change to see Robert Pattinson in a role other than a pale-faced Cullen. I did not even know that Pierce Brosnan was in it, so that was a bonus too. It was a nice story of how people from different walks of life come together who may never cross paths under ""normal circumstances"". A friend mentioned that it was a good movie with a very unexpected twist at the end. A twist indeed! This ending comes completely out of nowhere and you won't know it is happening until it is right on top of you! What a great spin to finish it off - I really think it ""made the movie"".The ending gave me goosebumps and even drew out some tears - you'll have to watch to find out!"
4,A gift,"I gave this as a gift so I can't really give it a fair review. Sorry, but I wanted to get if off my list."
1,THIS MOVIE IS AWFUL!,"Bad acting, slow, confusing, and non consistent plot-line. Skip this, it's awful. Robert Pattinson is attractive, sure, but this character seems like kind of a jerk and there is no real connection with him and the girl. She is boring, bad actress. Has nothing interesting to say, no chemistry. Save your money."
1,Remember Me *SPOILERS*,"Although the acting was fairly good by all in this film, I found the ending extremely inappropriate. It was not the fact that tragedy struck the characters involved, but it was the manner in which it struck. To have two young lovers cope with loss and confusion through a series of dates, fights, sex scenes and make-ups, to have the family reach some levels of reconciliation and renewed trust, only to have it end with Pattinson dying in the Twin Towers on 9/11 seemed too melodramatic, and unnecessarily so. Much like Titanic and Pearl Harbor (again, decent acting--not criticizing the actors), the film takes a horrifying, devastating tragedy in which thousands actually died and uses it to further a love story/drama. I can't get past that. I'm sure for many it made the film memorable and/or deepened the emotional value of the story, but to me, I think it's taking advantage of a real-life tragedy in order to make entertainment. Again, in my opinion, inappropriate."
2,Waste of film reel,"I found this movie to be quite dull and boring. I loved the two lead actors and they had great chemistry. Other than that, the storyline lacked a solid direction. The plot was weak and it was just a bunch of good acting in a storyless movie. I don't get what the ""point"" of it all was. Leaves the viewer asking ""why?"" and ""what for?"""
1,Not 4 stars for me,"Couldn't get past 25 minutes of the movie, I didn't like it, it was not interesting (although the story line to me was intriguing). Very slow moving, acting wasn't believable (in my opinion) and honestly I quit watching. I don't recommend at all..."
2,Acting was excellent.....the plot :?,"I'm not a tween or a fan of Robert pattinson; although I do enjoy Pierce Bronson acting. The movie had excellent acting from all involved. I was quite surprise considering I wasn't expecting much. RP is good with angst and I suspect most of his movies will be similiar going foward. I rated the movie two stars because of the plot, it was so poorly put together; it really didn't make much sense. I also think it was a poorly used ending of 9/11 event; considering the theme of the movie."
2,Horrible Plot,"This movie starts out pretty well, but fails to deliver anything. There is essentially no plot. It's basically a character study. You find yourself wondering what is going on through most of it because it jumps around all over the place and there seemed to be things that were cut out. Also, the things the characters do don't really make sense and just seemed contrived for drama. It's a character study with a very thin plot and a romance that lacks passion. Even the break up and the reconciliation is not passionate at all and you're left wondering why the characters did what they did. The acting is good, and I love Robert Pattinson, but it's just not a good movie."
4,s*** happens in life,"Unlike other reviewers that reacted negatively to the ending, as exploiting a tragic traumatic event, I thought it was used in good taste. The story is essentially about people just trying to live their lives as best they can, like we all do, unsuspecting, like a lot us are, and not realizing or expecting how cruel life can be sometimes. For most of us, the history-changing event happened on a day that started out like any other day, but it happened for real in real life and may happen again we never can be sure. One point that can be made of the movie is that, rich or poor, no one really is above it all - s*** can happen in life to anyone of us unexpectedly so appreciate what we have while we have it for they can be gone just like that."
2,Remember Me,"Actually my daughter wanted to see it because her daughter said it was so good. She said she liked it, but I did not hear anything that would sell me on the movie. So I watched it...no, I tried to watch it and about 30 minutes into it, I had no idea what I was watching, so I gave up. If a movie or a book is going to interest me, it should give me more to go on early on.Sorry but I really did not like what of it I saw, but I can only grade onthe first half hour."
5,very good,"I thought this movie was very good in that the characters were interesting and likable and the acting was top shelf. Robert Pattinson's good looks receive much more attention than his acting talents which are evident in this movie. He can do much more than Edward Cullen. He is very good and works well along side the others in this film. I especially liked Chris Cooper. The story is touching with a sad twist at the end which makes it not your ordinary ""happy ending"" love story. This doesn't spoil it, but leaves a strong impression."
5,Great Buy,A wonderful movie (expecially for those Robert Pattinson fans out there :P) and I got it in perfect condition. Definitly worth the money.
4,WOW,"Unlike some reviewers, I was not offended by the ending. I will also admit that I had read the reviews and was prepared for the ending. I think when you focus on the ending you miss the point of the movie. If you can get passed the slow and awkward start. It is a very good movie with great acting all around. Robert Pattinson showed again the depth of his acting (and I'm not referring to Twilight). This movie will make you appreciate the moments spent with love ones. I wish I had supported this movie while it was in the movie theatre."
5,A Must See,"I am a Robert Pattinson fan and wanted to see how he acted in other films besides Twilight. I was not disappointed. Rob and the other actors come together seamlessly to create a believeable real life story. There is real depth to all of the characters.I had not seen any teasers before seeing this film so I had no idea of the very emotional ending. I thought the life changing event at the end was very well handled, with a great deal of sensitivity. This movie reminds us to live life to its fullest and not to take anything for granted.I really enjoyed this movie and would highly recommend it. It is an engaging movie filled with a wide range of emotions. You really get to know all the characters which makes the ending all that more potent."
5,A MOVIE TO REMEMBER,"Well I must say I am in love with Rob Pattinson all over again. I loved him in Twilight, and I loved him in REMEMBER ME. Wow, what an amazing movie. Great story! Great acting. For whatever reason I had not remembered what the ending was about. That came as a total shock. Here I was going along loving this story, totally engrossed in it, and yet had no idea where it was heading. The idea was never a thought or a possibility. It was as if I was given two stories in one. It made me want to go back and watch it again with new eyes. But then again, I don't know if I could handle it, knowing what happened in the end.Very powerful and moving.Definitely a movie to REMEMBER."
4,Remember Me,"I loved this movie! I was so glad the family problems were diminished by the time the shocking end came. Well acted by all. Pierce, Robert, Emilie and Ruby all played excellent parts!"
5,don't read reviews they ma spoil th emovie...you've been warned :),This was a great movie and I had a hard time thinking about anything else for a few days after watching it. I kept thinking about all the people that Tyler could have represented on that day and other days when tragedies happen and it still makes me want to cry.
5,Robert Pattinson is more than just Edward Cullen,I've watched this movie many times & I can't get enough! Fantastic movie. I give it a much deserved 5 stars! Definitely a must see!
4,Remember me,"This film was very good. Loved the believable acting in it. Would watch this film over, and over again. Loved the way the subject matter was done with good judgement."
1,No Spoilers but the ending is an undeserving slap in the face!,"Length:: 5:55 MinsGina from Haunted Flower reviews ""Remember Me"" starring Robert Pattinson, Emilie de Ravin, Pierce Brosnan and Chris Cooper.[...]"
4,Great cast but watch out for the ending!,"I'm a big Robert Pattinson fan (even if I'm not a teen) and wanted to see another of his works. While it certainly doesn't having an upbeat tempo, he does a terrific job portraying such a brooding, damaged 21 year old student. The cast is amazing, especially the actress playing his younger sister, bringing a poignancy to a character in a difficult family situation.The ending, though, punched me in the gut. No big spoilers here but if your are sensitive to the coverage of 9/11, you might want to skip this movie."
3,It got better as it went along,When it was finished I felt sad and had an aha moment. I would recommend it and suggest it to a friend
2,could have been better,It was ok. Just a little slow but I liked the actors but i didn't like the ending very well .
3,remember me,This movie wasn't as good as we expected it. But it's nice to see Robert P. In something other than the twilight sagas. Its worth watching once but I wouldn't buy it for my collection.
4,DRAMA,one of the most DRAMATIC movies i've ever watched. WOW!! and a twist at the end you never see coming. 8-)
5,Great Movie,"Very real acting, two very broken people find their way to some happiness. Very sad ending. Probably won't watch the last five minutes ever again. So sad"
1,Extremely disappointing!,"The movie was a complete waste of time! It's the kind of movie that leaves a bitter taste after you watched it. It's all doom and gloom. I really tried to watch it with an open mind, hoping that it will turn better, but there was nothing positive about it. Human misery at it's finest!"
3,Cop out ending.,"Well, first I should say that I wasn't expecting much from this movie, however, I was slowly won over by both Robert Pattinson and Emilie de Ravin. The story was interesting, and the characters compelling, and I really thought it was going to go somewhere interesting..... then Wham! all of a sudden they make it about 911? I'm sorry, I consider myself patriotic, and I understand that many lives were affected by 911... but Really?? just when the story was getting good... I just thought it cheapened the value of rest of the story and exploited a terrorist attack."
2,Depressing,I love Robert Pattinson and his work in this movie was outstanding and very dramatic. I thought the movie was very good until the very end. It was very depressing! I do not reccomend this movie. It's not a feel good movie at all.
1,Rehashed,"I'm a fan of Mitch... but this is nowhere near as good as his previous releases. Much is rehashed from his other routines, and the new stuff isnt that funny. Highly disappointed."
3,Quite Okie-ay,"Very relaxing music, especially driving home from work. Not as good asThe Very Best Of J.J. Cale, (a,k.a. The Definitive Colleciton)."
3,"J.J. Cale's ""Okie"" is Okey Dokey","It has the cool sound of J.J. first effort. There are somegreat tunes too. I don't think it's exceptional Cale, butworth owning and checking out."
5,Awesome Belly Dancing DVD,"For anyone who is a belly dancer or or those who just like to watch this is a wonderful dvd. The dances and the music are beautiful. The fact that there is choreography to learn these dances is cool in itself. My troupe and I are going to try and learn these dances. I likes it so much, I ordered the other two in the series.Patra with Gems of Cairo"
4,Magic: Fantasy Bellydance,"I enjoyed this DVD. My only disappointment was that the dances seemed kind of short to me, other than that I liked them all. There are three dances and each dance is danced by a different person. Each of those dancers has an instructional part on the DVD that gives step by step instructions for each dance. The dancers are Autumn Ward, Isidora Bushkovski and Ariellah and the DVD comes from World Dance New York studios. There are two other DVD's in the series, but I haven't seen them yet. They are FANTASY BELLYDANCE:MYSTERY and FANTASY BELLYDANCE: DESIRE. You can find their website at [...]"
4,Very nice,I bought this DVD because a friend let me borrow it. I love the first dance Enchantress. Ms. Ward releases the inner Goddess. I enjoyed the others but not as much as the first dance. I hope to see more come this DVD collection.
4,Beautiful!,I find it very beautifully captured. Its good for performer looking for some ideas to add up to their routine and also a good inspiration as well. A good buy indeed!
4,Pretty good product,"This mesh top is pretty good, but the snaps that hold it in place can come undone fairly easily if your pet is a jumper. After several minutes of jumping at it my little 4 pound puppy moved it aside enough to jump out of the x-pen. Overall a good product if your puppy isn't too persistant at getting out!"
2,A title for your review,"Previously available as a double-CD package, and now as a single CD (but not here), this two-volume set of Jean Michel Jarre's live concerts in China is interesting from a historical point of view, but musically less so. All credit to Jarre for reproducing his music live, but the end result is thinner, less lush, and, with booming 80s drums, much more dated than the albums from which the tunes originate. The handful of original tunes are effective ('Arpeggiator' is particularly good), but it's a shame that they were never released in studio form. Essentially, Jarre's decision to include a light show *and* live music was brave, but let down by contemporary technology."
4,Great songs from a great young band,"This is definetly a band to watch, this record shows limitless promise and really steps outside the normal indie rock bounds to create something different, think R.E.M. meets the Foo Fighters, complimented by beautiful bass lines of almost unimaginable subtlity and grace, definetly worth my 10 bucks."
3,Dont read reviews by Justin Paxton,"I couldnt hold my tongue any longer...any reviewer who thinks Metallicas Master of Puppets sucks and gives The Geto Boys a rave review has no frigging business anywhere near metal. This bonehead hates Bob Dylan, I guess he never took the time to read any of the lyrics to some of the old gems. Im sorry but dude just stick to reviewing rap albums and save us the negative bull****!"
4,pretty good danzig album,"I like this album a lot, but i like lucifuge and the self-titled on a little better, but i wrote a review on lucifuge and i said ''buy this one along with the first and third.'' I really like this album and i reccomend this one with 1&2, i have the first 4, and planning on buying 7, but i still think this one stands out. BUY IT!!!!!"
4,Corny but likible!,"Hard to believe that the same people who gave us ""Little Willy"", ""ballroom blitz"" and ""fox on the run"" started out with 45s that are (unintentionally) more ""funny funny"" than Spinal Tap's ""gimmie some money""! But it's hard not to smile at the safe-as-milk teenage love of ""lollypop man"" or the neo 20s ragtime of ""slow motion"". Too bad these singles were unsuccessful at the time of their release. Even today they're still ignored. None of the countless Sweet best-ofs include any of their 68-70 singles (although the B side ""lonely out there"" did appear on a 1973 K-Tel comp!). Sweet fans should buy this since the corn ball A sides do set the stage for ""funny funny"", ""Papa Joe"", ""co-co"" and their tribute to ""Alexander Grham Bell"". The heavier metal B sides (""time"", ""jucier"") also predict """"Willy"", ""blitz"" & ""fox"". BUYER WARNING: the last four songs included, while pretty good, are NOT Sweet. They're from an unnamed studio band that Connely sang for during those sessions (c.1968)."
3,"Great product, lousy bottle.","This sweet almond oil makes a pretty awesome leave-in conditioner for my hair. And blended with some shea butter, it makes the best moisturizer for my feet! However, it's really hard with this bottle to get just a few drops out. You have to apply a lot of pressure and then you get a big squirt. If there was some way to control the amount of product you squeeze out, I would give this five stars."
3,"Good product, hard to dispense","I do like this oil, no odor and goes on like silk. However the bottle has a sort of valve that keeps the oil from coming out too quickly and it means that the bottle has to be squeezed - really hard, and it's not a soft bottle. I have arthritis and it's literally a pain, so I can't use it."
3,"Ok Almond oil, but where's the ""sweet"" part?","I've used sweet almond oils before that smelled that had a distinct rich almond smell, but this product had no smell. It moisturizes nicely, but I don't think all almond oils are equal because I tried some at Whole Foods (I WISH I could remember the brand) and it absorbed sooo nicely! This product is ok, but I won't be repurchasing sadly because the price is nice."
3,Beyond Skin Care,"This is a really light oil, but I don't use this on my skin. The Sweet Almond oil is a part of a mixture of organic essential oils for my hair. This concoction of shea butter, coconut oil and other oils has really revived my natural coils."
1,Does not smell like almonds -- how disappointing!,"I bought this to mix with unscented lotion so I could make my own luxurious almond-smelling lotion for cheaper than buying the Jafra royal almond stuff which smells woooooooonderful but is so pricy. When you order sweet almond oil, you assume it will smell like almonds but this smells like cooking oil. Lo and behold, on the bottle it says it has been put through a deodorizing process. How stupid! Who would deodorize something that smells so good, then not tell their customers, um, by the way, this has no smell in case you were expecting, um, a sweet almond oil to have an almond smell!Waste of $$$ but not worth returning."
3,Good Performance - bad recording!,I was shocked at the poor recording quality on this CD (it sounds like a few I have made with my minidisc recorder in clubs). The piano has a few keys that are annoyingly out of tune and the drum solo on track 2 is very distorted. It's ok when the drums aren't overblasting the mic and Bill avoids the bad keys (I can't believe he would use this piano!).
4,Big Smith Will Make Your Day,"This band has a sound that stands out in the music world. Take a little bit of hillbilly, mix in some Johnny Cash and Wille Nelson, then add great instrumentation and lyrics and you've got Big Smith. ""No, Sir"", ""Preacher"", ""Big Rock"" and ""Backwater"" are just some of the well-written songs on this album. If you're a little bit country, and a little bit rock-n-roll, you're gonna love this band."
2,Neither cat would eat this flavor,"Unfortunately, my cats didn't like this flavor. When I feed it, they never finish their food and I have to throw a significant portion of it away (or give it to my dog, as he'll eat anything)"
1,damaged goods,"I ordered a case of Merrick wet cat food, actually I ordered two different flavors, and the case of Surf and Turf was badly damaged before it was sent.Almost every can was dented, one was missing from the case , one was so dented it had spilled the contents. The cans would not have been for sale on the shelf. The other case was fine and this was not the fault of Amazons's packaging, the case was full of damaged cans to begin with. Whoever put this order together should have caught this. Smelly, too! I am afraid to give my pets most the cans as they are so dented as to be almost broken open.Expensive and disappointing as I live a long way from any pet store that carrys Merrick."
1,Much smaller than anticipated,"The glasses were much smaller than I anticipated, so I was going to return them, but was told there would be a 15% restocking fee and I'd have to ship them back with a tracking number. After I did the math I figured it would cost me more to send them back than to just keep them, even though I won't use them :-/"
3,Disappointing,"Should have listened to the last reviewer. I also had read Coughlin's Merely Married and thoroughly enjoyed it. This book--admittedly, her first effort--was not nearly as polished and frankly, I found the characters rather boring and found myself yawning throughout. I do look forward to seeing what Coughlin does with her next book--if she continues in the same vein as her last book, it's sure to be a keeper."
3,"Not so savage after all, but still fun","I must agree with the previous reviewers. The fact that Lord Savage is not really a savage is obvious from Chapter 2, and the ""taming"" process takes rather too long taking this into account. Despite that and a certain lack of writing experience that shows up in the plot, the book is still fun and makes a good vacation read. If you prefer serious Historical Romance try Julie Garwood Highland series or Georgette Heyer books."
4,I will look for more books by this author.,This was the first time to read a book by Patricia Coughlin. Lord Savage included delightful characters and a storyline that did not grow stale. I love authors with a sense of humor and will definitely look for more books by Ms. Coughlin.
3,A lesson how to become an english aristocrat,"I had read ""Merely married"" and enjoyed it so I was looking forward to another good book by the same author. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed. Both Lord Savage himself and his teacher Ariel are quite boring characters. The story is about a teacher in manners who tries to teach a man, who she thinks is not familiar with civilisation, to become a worthy heir to a title. It is very obvious for everyone that this man already knows what the game is about. It takes a while for the other characters to realise this fact and this process is sometimes quite entertaining but mostly boring."
1,Yawn....,"I think in the future I will pay more attention to negative reviews than those usually over done 5* reviews. Poor Leon, Lord Savage, comes to Enland and everyone thinks he must be a savage for real as he has lived his life on some Pacific island. That is just period ignorance and I could accept it. I was glad that Leon was actually as well mannered as the next man but did it really need so many chapters for Ariel, the woman hired to ""tame"" him, to be acknowledged? That was exceedingly boring. Also, the romance between them just did not happen. I am also finding it more than irksome that so many romance writers insist that the female heroine, who loves our hero, won't marry him because she loves him but is not sure if he loves her. Oh, but she will certainly marry someone else who she can't stand??? That is just stupid. Any girl in her right mind would marry the man she loved - since Leon does ask - and make her life with him. To think otherwise it dumb."
4,really a good bargain...,"I bought this item from amazon for my dad, who has BP problems and its really coming handy for him...apart from some erroneous reading at times (mostly due to body and wrist position), its an excellent thing to have at home...no need to go to the doctor to have ur BP checked....and above all, very user-friedly and easy to use...I would certainly recommend it..."
3,Wrist monitor review,"I just purchased the EW3002 but I should have purchased the EW3032S, which is the same unit with step up features. If you notice both have the same price - so why not buy the EW3032S."
5,Accurate Wrist BP Monitor,"I agree with Mr White about the accuracy of this model. It is very easy to use if you hold the hand agaist the chest with fingers touching the collar bone. This ensures the monitor level with the heart. This technique eliminates the need for elbow support. Thus, readings can be taken anywhere.It is also comfortable and compact. Good for those who want to carry it while travelling."
1,Not Good,I have my BP a little on the higher side.This meter keeps showing me as normal.I have verified this with the doctors office and i was shocked to see the difference.I would suggest just dont depend on this meter as a source .
4,Panasonic blood pressure monitor,"Hi,I purchased this product last month.The feel is good and it gives results quite fast but the results are varying even though the equipment is tied at the same position and tested multiple times."
2,Not reliably accurate,"I bought this based on the review of a doctor who tested it out in his OR. I got it and it seemed great at first, and then my readings seemed more erratic. I read and followed the instructions but got way different results from my doctor at the last visit. I believe this unit may be like cheap tire pressure guages. They are calibrated and work well at first, but then start to fail."
4,Good Product for the Value,"1. Shipping was on time and arrived well ahead of schedule.2. Product is easy to use, digits on screen are big and readable.3. Only drawback I found was this product requires sitting in specific position and arm should be angled in a particular way for the results to be accurate.4. It has been used for about once/twice a day since last one month and the batteries are still going strong."
1,BAD,"With an equipment like a BP monitor, it is either GOOD or BAD. This one is BAD ! I know that I have been border line with my blood pressure for the last 3 years. When I tested the equipment, it kept showing my readings as being SUPER normal while it was not the case [verified at the doctor's office]. This is dangerous considering how easy it is for one to keep thinking that they are maintaining normal readings."
4,Charlie Chan in Paris,I have always liked old mysteries. They allow you to use your Gray Cells(smile).
5,I Would Encourage You to Buy This Book,"It has helped me accomplish the hardest levels that I tried to defeat. It tells me what is in other episodes, and it gives me good facts about the characters. It has helped me along the journey from Episode I to Episode III."
5,"Fast, complete, satisfied","I was well pleased with my order, I needed it fast and it arrived much sooner than anticipated. Wonderful!"
4,family treasure,"Our children's grandfather brought this treasure home as a gift when he visited Australia almost 20 years ago. Our four kids are grown, but when we are all home for an occasion, we still can sit and read out-loud from this delightful book. We have been known to laugh until we truly cry at the antics of these very human and endearing characters. I rate it with Winnie-the-Pooh as the best ever, for children AND adults."
3,beautiful background!,"I ""grew up"" with the mafia in our lives! As a little girl never confirmed but heard stories when adults didn't know I was listening! I see a young girl adding her perspective whimsical as it may be and forgotten to protect her spirit! I agree with a reviewer the subtitles need help!!!! I am a self taught Italian speaker and they took words out and added word to make the scene more ""intense""! I am a serious movie buff of all kinds! The acting was laughable! Rita come on the director must have told her to look intense! But if u look at her all u see is a painfully(trying) whining looking 30 year old! sometimes if you look real closely she brings her eyebrows down to pout to keep from laughing! towards the end I couldn't look at her without cracking up of her performance and age!She may have been young but she looks well into her late20's!The story was a tragic yet tribute to a young girl who never had a life! But she died saving countless others!"
2,Not a story that needed to be made into a movie.,"Another ""mafioso"" drama, which, unfortunately, on this occasion is a true story. This makes the misery of a young girl being subjected to archaic criminal tradition even more poignant with a tragic outcome. No real story, but it caught the ""darkness"" of that life."
5,"Insightful, Brilliant, Simply Correct","Karen Horney is one of the greatest of the Post-Freudian psychoanalysts. Horney's concepts of the root causes of neurosis, a basic anxiety, a sense of lurking hypocrisy , an idealized self image, conflicting impulses, are ingeniously insightful and, I have found, correct. Her paradigm is very useful for understanding human behavior; not only the behavior of those who would be diagnosed with a formal disorder but also of those whose personalities contain elements of neurosis not extensive enough for formal diagnosis. Understanding her concepts can also be valuable for those of us who would like to understand our own neuroses better. If you want to understand psychoanalysis, read Freud, read Jung, but read Horney as well. Without her ideas, your understanding will be sorely incomplete. Remember, Jung and Frued can be integrated with Horney, synthesis brings greater understanding. Read, learn, and enjoy the benefits."
1,Sux,I don't like this CD. Ever since she left A.B. her music is not all that great. She is only famous because of the DEATH of SELENA. If Selena were here she wouldn't be where she is. I LOVE some of her songs but not many. The only reason she has so much going for her is because she does not have much competition in her category. That's what I think. Her best CD was the one before this one. That one rocked.
5,Well Done,Its hard with so many new cd's coming out deciding what to buy. This is certainly a CD worth purchasing.
3,I DONT HAVE THE CD SO I CANT RATE IT,I JUST WANNA SAY THE FIRST TIME I HEARD YOU IS WHEN YOU DID THE VOICE OF YOUNG SELENA IN THE MOVIE AND I THOUGHT IT WAS THE REAL SELENA SINGING WHEN SHE WAS A LITTLE GIRL SO YOU HAD A GREAT VOICE WHEN YOU WERE SINGING IN ENGLISH AND I THINK YOU WOULD HAVE A GOOD ENGLISH CROSSOVER CD SO KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK
3,Jennifer is fine,if your a big jennifer fan and this is the only cd you have check out jennifer y los jetz that was her band on emi latin i seen that jennifer only had one cd as a singer but she has many other cd's ..she is ok but not my style her music is always extermly happy like a freaking kids show theme music and sometimes it sounds ok but that is just me i still ove the girl .. i got all her cd's
4,She's hot and catchy,"Jennifer Peña's new CD Libre is all you could look for in variety. From tejano, cumbia, pop y baladas this has everything you could need to start a latin collection. Look out for her previous release, Abrazame y Besame as well. Also that great video that comes included on the CD is great to watch if you've got quicktime."
4,"Yep, an OK album","I am a big Jennifer fan. This particular CD is a great CD, but it takes several listenings to really fall in love with it - unlike 'Abrazame y Besame', which I fell in love with on the first listening. Personally, I like the Cumbia songs on this cd best, especially 'Corazón Bandido' and 'Fuego Lento [Version Cumbia]'. The catchy 'Que Me Ame Más' is also a big winner."
1,"Well, well, well","Funny thing about the 5 star review by Gary Popkin - I just watched this whole thing on YouTube and what should I read at the end? ""Produced and directed by Gary Popkin"". I suppose it's good to believe in one's own work....It would still be ridiculous to charge $20 for this even if it wasn't available for free. The production values are very basic and the moderator doesn't manage to control the discussion tightly enough (though admittedly he tries) to get the Loose Change guys to answer the evidence they are presented with.If the subject interest you, though, it's worth watching on YouTube: Mark Roberts continually tries to ground the discussion in actual facts and it is fascinating to see how little Dylan Avery and Jason Bermas (LC creators) are willing or able to engage with those facts."
5,What's the truth about 9/11?,"Were explosives used to bring down the World Trade towers and building number 7 on September 11, 2001? Did a plane crash in Pennsylvania? Did a missle hit the Pentagon? Was 9/11 a ""false-flag"" operation, an inside job? Hear all sides of the argument in these two editions of the weekly political TV talk show Hardfire, as two of the creators of Loose Change, Jason Dermas and Dylan Avery, debate Mark Roberts, a leading 9/11 debunker. Ronald Wieck, a well-informed 9/11 debunker himself, hosts."
4,Great Gadget,"First I have to say, it's sharp. And when I say ""sharp"" I mean that it cuts your fingers just by looking at it. So, when you read the instruction pamphlet and come to the part where it says ""Watch your fingers"", take it serious. Now that we have that out of the way, I can honestly say that it is a great gadget to have. I cut pretty much any vegetable with it and ALWAYS use the safe guard, after a few painful encounters.It comes with 3 different parts which can make your veggies from shredded to super fine shredded or you just use the slicer which you can also adjust from big to paperthin slices. Because of the super-sharp blades it cuts even cabbage like butter. It's easy to clean and doesn't need much space on your kitchen counter.The only down thing is that it's not really useful to cut small amounts such as garlic or pieces of ginger. For that you have to use the good old kitchen knife."
2,Not living up to the hype,"I got this as a gift, because it was added to my wishlist after a reading a bunch of reviews that praised it for its great performance for the price. I'm certainly not experiencing that. The ""super sharp"" blade is apparently extremely dull as it takes a large amount of force to cut anything I've tried, onions, potatoes, apples on any thickness setting. perhaps I've gotten a defective unit, but this is way more dangerous than if it were extremely sharp, and less useful than a knife. And the finger guard doesn't hold anything either. Really, a terrible experience overall."
4,super slicer,good value and efficient but not as substantial as others costing a lot more. It does the job but you have to be careful as its quite small and fingers can slip off the fiddly slider.
5,"I love it, all the songs there just so great to listen to!","I'm 15 and when we moved in with my step Dad I found it in his CDs, and now I like it more then he does, I also have Zoo Look and I really like that one too, I hope to buy them all some day. I give it 5 stars. hope you like it too."
4,Ummm,"Yes, it's JMJ... Solid programming, inventive, interesting, but for a guy so tied to my Ogygene album this is just not quite there"
5,wow,Electronic tunes at their best. Listen to this and chill. I still chill with this after all these years.
2,Better than Zoolook but...,"As you might think, I am not a die hard fan of JMJ, I think that when only die hard fans rates an album, it makes you think that with such a high rating, everybody should love this album and this is not the thruth.Not everybody like this king of musical experimentation, some do but some don't...I like Oxygene and Equinoxe, and even after all those years, they are still good to listen too. Rendez vous offers some really good moments, but we are far from the perfection as Oxygene or Equinoxe. Rendez-vous is easier to get use to that Zoolook is, but we are far from a near perfect album. That's all !"
2,Misses the mark,"In my opinion, ""Rendezvous"" is the weakest JMJ album to date, lacking the fluid focus of most of his other works. It's also, with the possible exception of ""Oxegene"", his least ""fun"". ""First"" and ""Last"" Rendezvous are haunting , but ""Second"" and ""Fifth"", while initially stirring and robust, go on too long with precious little variation and left me little in terms of imagery and/or emotion. The peppy "" Fourth"" is a toe-tapper but feels out-of-place. ( Put in for Club Mixes I'm sure ) Save your money."
4,A wonderful gift book!,"There Are No Mistakes is a beautiful reminder that in the ebb and flow of life, we are enough. Eleanor Wiley's humor and insights lead the reader to contemplate how to be accepting and compassionate with themselves.When I started reading this book it felt very slow and plodding, until I realized that I was trying to keep up with whirling thoughts and I was not ""present"" to comprehend the spiritual truths Eleanor reveals. I was reminded, that even though I may make a wrong choice, all is not lost. Instead, I can refocus the negative energy toward reflecting on the gift the decision unveils.Even though we have not met, Eleanor is a very wise woman whom I would call a trusted friend.Armchair Interviews says: A wonderful gift book--if only for yourself."
2,Fannie vs. Irma,"I was given Fannie a decade ago by a girlfriend. I loved it. It was my first substantial cookbook and I cherished it (Esp. her handwritten version of chocolate chip cookies on the inside cover...)I used ol' FF for several years, granted perhaps only tried a few dozen recipes) but then I discovered Joy of Cooking. Since I found Joy 4 years ago, I haven't touched Irma (except for an occasional cookie hankering)My two cents - If you want only one ""American Classic Cookbook"" then go for Joy of Cooking. It gives not only comparable recipes, but much more instruction in prep."
5,Fannie Farmer Cookbook - A good foundation for all cooks,I lost my Fannie Farmer cookbook in the Angora fire a few years ago and this is the replacement copy. The updated recipes and information are a must in any kitchen. There are basic and extensive recipes that cover a wide range (regional and ethnicity) with information and tips that can't be found elsewhere. This cookbook is invaluable as a broad-base reference guide. It also makes a great gift.
5,Great Basics Cookbook,This is a great basic cookbook/reference guide. I damaged the first one I had and immediately went out and bought a second copy. Great for new cooks!!!
5,"The Indispensable Kitchen ""bible"" for all cooks","This cookbook is for the novice as well as the experienced cook. I am an advanced cook and use it almost every day, while my 14-year old who is just learning to cook, also finds it easy to use.This would be a great gift for the new bride, or young adult just starting out ."
2,I need the old edition,"I recently moved and inadvertently forgot to bring my old, stained, and tattered Fannie Farmer cookbook with me, so I ordered this one. While it's still passable as a ""comfort food"" cookbook, I think it's been updated to compete with The Joy of Cooking, not exactly a high standard to aim for. New potatoes in beef stew? Give me a break."
5,Great book,"I love this cookbook! It covers everything you always wanted to know about cooking, cooking preparation, measurment conversion, etc..."
1,The Fannie Farmer revision broke my heart,"On the shelf in my mother's kitchen there is an old, brittle gold-covered book. It's held together with clear tape, and certain pages are well splattered with stains. But I love that book. In that book are some of my favorite and yummiest memories. It's the Fannie Farmer Cookbook.So when I got my own copy for my birthday I was ecstatic. Sure, the cover was different, but inside I'd have my own chewy brownies and buttery sugar cookies. Only...they changed the recipes! The brownies that were universally praised by my class when I took them to school as a kid -- they were all different!How am I going to make Fannie Farmer classics if they aren't classic? Now I have a useless book, and my mother's copy is falling apart. I beg of the publishers - reissue the original, without any changes, full of all that high cholesterol goodness. Otherwise, I will never be able to move out of my mother's house, and she's starting to get mad at me."
3,Not as good as previous editions,"I was rather disappointed with this edition of Fannie Farmer. It is poorly organized. I think it is trying to cover too much territory and ends up not giving enough basics, e.g. there isn't much about turkey except how to roast it. I also dislike the type font.I formerly had a a second edition and one from about 1980 which I preferred. I'll use this new version until I replace my earlier edition."
5,A classic for your kitchen,"I am introducing my 16 year old granddaughter to cooking from scratch and needed a simple to understand book. I saw this at a friend's home and loved the basic measurements tables as well as the recipes. I ordered 3 of these: one for my granddaughter, one for my son's girlfriend, and one for me. This one is already marked for future cooking experiments."
2,Disappointed,"This book doesn't contain nearly as many recipes as the older versions - it's very disappointing. In the older version, each recipe has a list of suggested variations following. But this one doesn't make any suggestions. Ah well, it's a gift for a beginning chef from another country who hasn't made American food much, so it should be fine for that purpose. I just don't see why they can't re-do the older version in a way that is true to the older version!"
4,The Fannie Farmer Cookbook: Anniversary,I bought this to replace the paperback one that was so old and used that it fell apart. This one is bigger print for my old eyes and still has all the info that has been used for years. Good starter cookbook!
5,The Fannie Farmer Cookbook: Anniversary,"Of all North American cookbooks this stands supreme. It is comprehensive, precise and clear and above all, relevant to the 21st Century. Fannie Farmer still rules, OK?"
5,A Celebration of Down Home Cooking,"I first received the paperback edition of the Fannie Farmer Cookbook for Christmas, and found it to be extraordinary in the realm of cookbooks. The recipes are simple, with excellent explanations and plenty of additional resources. I have always been able to count on finding a recipe I can make without running to the store for extra ingredients, and they've always come out excellently.I wasn't sad when my paperback copy fell apart as I had reason to purchase the larger hardback edition. Not only is it easier to read and stays open more easily than the paperback, but the already good organization and layout is enhanced by the additional space on the pages, as well as the additional colors used for pictures and emphasis. Could something as good as the Fannie Farmer Cookbook get even better? It certainly has in this hardcover edition!"
3,Be Careful,"The banana bread in this book is hard and chewy. I can't get a single cake to come out right. The frostings are too complicated or simply don't taste good, (I went back to using Wilton's recipes.) The swedish meatballs are dry and have no sauce. There are only three recipes I use from this book regularly Spaghetti and meatballs, baking powder biscuits, and griddle cakes. Even the cornbread was dry. (The book said cornbread was ""supposed"" to be dry. I don't think so! Luckily I could call my mom and get a good recipe.) There are some good recipes in this book and some can be modified if you know enough about cooking. Mine is covered with scribbled ingredient adjustments. I would much rather have something that tasted good the first time.I gave it three stars because it does have a lot of interesting information like how to make your own pasta and fondant."
1,Lard and Bacon Fat Recipes Included in This Book,A lot of lard and bacon fat in these recipes: A pig will eat anything including human feces. I stay away from swine recipes.
2,Fannie Farmer Cookbook,I had ordered a new edition of the cookbook and received a used one. I had given it to my daughter in Maine and she kept it because I had ordered it from CT..
5,great all purpose cookbook,this is a great all purpose cookbook. i gave it to my daughter as a shower present. i have had mine for 30 years. cas
5,The best all-around cookbook,"This is the cookbook I pull from my crowded shelves the most often. With great how-to sections, great tasting recipes, and clear directions it's a hands-down winner. Highly recommended whether you're just starting out or are wanting to learn more."
5,Best of the best,"The Fanny Farmer cookbook is the cookbook I turn to first. So many of my favorites are in there. Buttermilk biscuits. Hollandaise sauce. Banana cake. I already had this edition but when my daughter moved out on her own I bought her the latest. She was disappointed when she discovered many of our favorites were not in the new edition. So when my old FF started falling apart, I was happy to find this gently used 12th edition on amazon."
5,Fannie Farmer Fave,"I've been married to my husband for 8 years now and before that I hadn't heard of Fannie Farmer, I had always just used Betty Crocker. He had an old paper back version, which had pretty much fallen apart on us and we went in search for a hardback version, which this one is. To my delight, the Fannie Farmer cookbook is full of useful info and practical tips, more so than most cookbooks. If I were getting a cookbook for someone new to cooking, I'd make it a Fannie Farmer. Too, the info in this handy little cookbook is a good reminder to an experienced cook."
4,Chants Magnetiques,"Chants Magnetiques~ Jean-Michel Jarre is a good album but it is not anywhere close to his first two albums. Oxygene and Equinox are much more consistent. Magnetic Fields has some nice tracks but the keyboard sounds are terrible compared to the first two albums. I know that this was one of the first albums to use digital keyboards and for the most part it sounds like using protoype keyboards and that is not a good thing. Jarre is here steering a bit too much in the realm of art for arts sake and it does sound a bit too avantgarde at times, but still nowhere close to the zoolook disaster that he releases some years later. On the whole a pretty decent album that lacks consistency and could have been so much better but it is alright and gets 4 stars."
2,Not up to par,"Of the eight JMJ albums I have, this is my least favorite. The melodies are not that compelling and the sound textures are a bit odd (the digital sound effects don't seem all that interesting). I bought this after listening to Les Concerts En Chine (The Concerts in China), in which JMJ performs all of these pieces live. I much prefer the live performances, which are not dramatically different but seem to have more punch than the studio versions.Oxygene is still his best, with Oxygene 7-13 an admirable follow-up. Chronologie, Equinoxe and Rendez-Vous are consistently rewarding, and I also like some of the tracks on the 2000 disc, Metamorphoses, a somewhat radical change of pace. But this disc just doesn't ring my chimes.Trivial pursuit: I'm curious as to why Les Chants Magnetiques is translated as Magnetic Fields. Chants is songs or tunes; champs is fields. Both words are pronounced exactly the same, but it's hard to imagine that JMJ would get confused, as French is his native language."
3,Not my favorite,This one was not my favorite. I had heard one of the tracks on a compilation but that seemed to be the best. So I can not recommend this album
3,Mediocracy at its best...,"I'm a proud owner of all of Jarre's productions to date. I listen to his music on a daily basis and enjoy it all over again. The only member of the 18 CD set that isn't being played on a daily basis is this CD... I find it dull and lacking in the sense of the usual Jarre melodic gardens. You can hear it's Jarre behind the notes, but a somewhat regular and a much less innovative that what I've come to expect of such great musician."
3,Where's the rest of the book?!,"This was my first reaction upon opening the parcel containing this book. Truly, it is a wonderful book; chock full of colourful illustrations and lively text. As such, it is a keeper.Alas, it simply isn't enough! At 96 pages it is barely longer than a two part magazine article.Where, for example, are the futuristic designs for the 1939 World's Fair? Or the 1962 World's Fair? Or the 1964 World's Fair?Where are the designs for seminal 50's sci-fi movies like 'Forbidden Planet'?Where are the concept drawings for Disneyland's Tomorrowland and Epcot Center?Where are the space age clothing designs of Rudi Gernreich? Where are'The Jetsons'for crying out loud?Wherever they are, they are not to be found in the pages of this book. Never has a book created within me such a mixture of delight and colossal disappointment."
4,Welcome to the FUTURE!,"This ia a great book, for science fiction fans or just people interested in future forecasting of the 20th century. The book deals with the ideas, serious or not, of what past artists, scientists and writers thought the future would look like. Cities, cars, airships, rockets, monorails fill the pages of this book, with text which guides you on your tour of the 'future'. Some designs like the floating airports, the car/boat and the monorail HAVE changed reality (for some of us),while other ideas, like the six mile high tower, are not yet available.My problem, my ONLY problem, with the book is how small it is. At 96 pages it barely covers anything. The chapter on robots is only TWO pages long and only has TWO illustrations. I noticed only ONE underwater city and some drawings, like a few pages on the 'Future City' have no text at all.Still, it is a great gift for sci-fi fans, future engineers or fans of the cartoon series ""Futurama""."
3,Revolutions,"Revolutions~ Jean-Michel Jarre is a very uneven cd. The first 4 tracks are stupendous and are built up in an ouverture, part I, part II and ending with part III. This is a stroke of pure genius. Revolutions is an alright track however it does sound dated and that is not a good thing barely 20 years after it initial release. London Kid is one of my least favorite Jarre tracks and it truly sounds like cheap elevator music at best. Tokyo Kid and Computer Weekend are alright. September is a tribute to a person so remote that I have no idea whom it is. The track is sugar sweet and that is not good when it comes to this kind of music. The Emigrant ends on a down note. If the album instead had stuck with the industrial them the entire album and had part 4, part 5, part 6 and a finale then we could have talked about probably his best album since oxygene. However, it ends up being just average and that is such a shame when Jarre can do so much more then this."
2,One of his weaker releases,"I am reviewing the entire album of this name....This disc seems very patched together; not a cohesive piece or album like Zoolook, Rendevous, or Chronologie. If you are new to JMJ, I suggest one of those first, or his earlier Oxegene.A lot of Revolutions sounds cheesy and forced. When I listen to this disc, which is rare, I pick out a few of the better tracks and skip the rest."
4,Revolutions history,"It's better every time I listen. It realy covers, IMO, the world revolutions.Listening to this album is learning history, musicaly.I recomend it to any jarre fan, I think it will not be disapointed."
2,POOR OLD BELA,"Horror icon Bela Lugosi kills virgin brides to extract gland fluids to keep his ancient wife alive. Sounds spooky! It's not. Lugosi plays a mad scientist who heads a burly gang that includes an ugly old hag, a malicious dwarf, and two goons. They shuffle around in this 1942 boring travesty. Midget actor Angelo Rossitto(a favorite in many John Barrymore classics) follows Lugosi around. To appreciate the ""Great One"", see 1932's ""White Zombie(excellent DVD) or ""The Black Cat"". This minor cheapie will put you fast asleep...."
2,Fair,"In comparison to most of the other films Lugosi made for Sam Katzman, this one isn't all that bad. Katzman, of course, was a master at rehashing the same old story again and again, and this one is no exception. The real villain in this film is the tired, stale plot which, like many others, injects a brassy, annoying newspaper reporter into the story, along with a dim-witted photographer; as always, the reporter eventually solves the mystery. Lugosi does his best with the script, which would have been better had it been approached with a bit of originality. Of course, if it had involved a fresh approach, it wouldn't have been a Sam Katzman film. Still, it is a mildly entertaining film at times, and should be enjoyed as such. Just don't expect to see a classic."
4,GREAT CANADIAN PRODUCTION,"THIS CD WAS DISTRIBUTED PRIVATELY BY A LABEL - IMAGINE RECORDS FROM SAINT SAUVEUR QUEBEC , CANADA . THIS EAST GERMAN SINGER - SONG WRITER IS LIVING IN NORTH AMERICA AND WROTE + SANG HER SONGS IN ENGLISH + ONE IN FRENCH . 9 GREAT TRACKS TITLED SECRETS HAS A PRETTY SOUND AND BELIEVE WAS PRODUCED AND RECORDED IN QUEBEC . DISCOVER A NEW YOUNG TALENT ."
2,Not impressed,"I am very sad to say, despite all the positive reviews, I was very disappointed in this movie. I guess it is like when you have this idea in your head of what you think it will be like, and it isn't at all what you think? Well I left this movie feeling like there should have been something more. I felt like the plot wasn't fully finished. There were some loose edges that could have been filled in.Just not my type of film, gave it two stars for the excellent acting though."
3,Sunday Entertainment,"I hate this time in OUR world history, but this is a good story. I only gave it 3 stars because its a familiar theme but the actors did a good job and film quality is top notch. If one considers the price I suppose you could add another star for ""less expensive"" entertainment."
4,With A Few Qualifications A Good Book,"This book covers all the fundamentals of Greek grammar: nouns, adjectives, personal pronouns, verbs, etc. It does break down these areas in a logical fashion in just under eighty pages plus a glossary on grammatical terms. Knowing the information in the book will definitely help you decipher the language. The Greek lettering is tiny so read in a good light. Also, there are many sections that exist as a series of rules (rule applies in cases when preceded or followed by these eight or ten letters). That kind of information is difficult to read and even more difficult to remember but perhaps that aspect of Greek can not be simplified or made more palatable. All in all I am very glad I bought this book, and I feel my knowledge of the language was significantly enhanced."
1,What is The Point????,It is surely the most pointless exercise ever to put a book on the website which has no price and is unavailable to buy!! What is Amazon thinking??????????
4,Against all odds,"I'm a Jack Higgins fan, so I'm inclined to be supportive, BUT, this character strains belief to the limit....with actions bordering on superhuman and a villainous depiction of ""friends"" and lovers, you end up saying ""unbelievable""."
2,Disappointing,"This is an early Jack Higgins book (1971). I have enjoyed many of his early books but this one was quite disappointing. The story was ridiculously hard to believe and at times the story read like a ""B"" movie action script. Nevertheless the story moved at a quick rate and had plenty of action."
3,Dis - jointed story!,"Overall, the book was OK......not the usual style of Jack Higgins. The story was dis - jointed, it took things for granted.The story jumped around making it difficult to follow. Read the book if you have nothing else to read."
3,Heavy reading,"Jack Higgins always writes good action mysteries, but sometimes it gets too complicated to keep up with the plot and keep all the characters straight."
2,Disappointed,"After reading Jack Higgins for many years, I have expected a certain level of action, mystery, and insight. There certainly was a good degree of action, but the mystery was so convoluted in what was real or imagined that it gave way to a psychological questionmark at every corner. While I was satisfied that the ""hero"" was saved, I was dissappointed that his ""mentor"" was a traitor and the love interest in the daughter went no-where. So there was nothing satisfying that the ""hero"" accomplished other that staying alive. As I said, not what I have come to expect in a Higgins Novel."
2,Ok Study Guide,"This book is long on vocabulary and short on convenient daily application. It would make a nice reference book or supplement, but is not a practical book to keep on your desk for daily conversations."
1,A Game of Chance Anyone?,"If you like games of chance you'll love this device. Will it work? Won't it work? How long before it freezes my Ipod? 20 seconds or 30? Will I be able to actually hear the recording over the hard disc noise? So many interesting variables.Sometimes, when the planets are aligned and the barometric pressure is just right, you can get a passable low-fi recording from close range (0-5 feet). If you are looking for anything other than that, you probably won't be satisfied with this product. And if you're looking for reliability -- well, just read the rest of the reviews. You'll get the picture."
5,"Getting me an ""A"" in my history classes","This is a great product for college students to use during lecture classes. I have found it very helpful in my history courses in which I am expected to understand what is important to take notes on during an hour lecture when the tests are not for weeks or sometimes a month later. This item requires no skill to operate; you simply plug and record. The only downside is that it picks up every sound, even the hard drive spinning up. This is not a good device for quality sound recording, rather it is good to get a basic recording. That it why I recommend this product for college students. It will improve your grades if you actually listen to the lectures after you record them."
1,Does not work on 5G,"I have a new 5G. The 5G has two places to plug things in. One is a usb port at the base, which is where I plug in a usb cable to connect to my computer. The other is the headphone jack. The Belkin will fit neither."
1,NOT compatible with Nano 2G,"Contrary to the product information on this item's listing on Amazon, it is NOT compatible with the Nano 2G. It has male connector hardware for which there is no corresponding female receptacle on the Nano. Also the product packaging does not indicate that this device can be used with the NANO.I am not the first here to notice this. My bad for not reading the reviews before buying. Shame on Amazon for not correcting this misleading listing and shame on Belkin for providing Amazon with misleading specifications."
1,be careful,"Got it and plugged it into my IPod and there was a major incompatibility. The screen showed up that their was a voice recorder in the IPod but when I went to record I received an error message that the IPod could not locate a microphone. Perhaps an IPod problem? The Ipod is a 4th Generation 40 gig that is fully updated. I think Belkin needs to engineer the recorders to work with all the new IPods, with the exception of the minis. Have not been able to resolve the issue. I am sure IPod will state that it is a Belkin problem and that Belkin will throw the ball back to IPod?????"
2,The recorder is WAY too sensitive,"I'm an opera singer and bought the Belkin Voice Recorder to record my performances, practices, etc... however, it turns out to be completely useless for my needs. ANYTHING LOUDER THAN A VOICED-WHISPER WILL BE WILDLY DISTORTED, AND COME OUT AS WHITE NOISE. It's too bad there are no other microphones for the iPod, and that this product has absolutely no versatility, but now that I know Apple, it's not at all surprising...."
4,School is cool with this cool new tool,"If you like iPods, and your friends hate going to lectures, you can now record it for them and make them pay to hear it. You could recompress the mono WAV format into aac or mp3 and email it to them or put it on the local network for people to share, making you popular and a tool for the people who, darn it, just need to sleep in."
2,"so and so product, needs improvement","Upside: I can record with my ipod for the lectures that I go to, and download it to iTunes and share them with my friends who need to listen to the lectures on CD or WAV files.Downside:1) the quality of recording is average2) it records the hard drive noise that comes up within the ipod every 2 mins. I can still listen to the foreground, but I have to put up with that noise! It is a pain.All Belkin needs to do is to have a mic input so that people can plug in whatever mic they have, and change the software to adjust the mic sensibility"
2,A Word of Warning!,"This gizmo does NOT fit the newer iPods. I bought it thinking it could be used on my 60G video iPod but it cannot be attached to it. Just a word of warning for you ""newer iPod"" owners. There may be an adapter of some kind... I am looking into that. :-("
4,Not Bad.,"This device is great for recording voice. I tried recording voice from the back of a room, and it was very hard to understand it. I needed to be closer to get better quality. I wouldn't use this to record live music events, it will not work. If you want to record memos, or voice in a room, this is a great device. The files are saved in WAV format, and are pretty small. I didn't have any battery issues with this device, but I only recorded for about one hour..."
1,compatibility information is not correct,The above product details specifying that this product is compatible with a Nano are not correct. The packaging clearly does not list the nano as what it is for (iPod only). I now have purchased a product that is not appropriate for my device. If Amazon posted high-resolution images of product packaging this would have been easy to determine.
5,Essential for old-school iPods,"I use my circa-2005 iPod -- yes, it's still alive and kicking -- as a voice recorder for the many interviews I conduct as part of my job. The Belkin attachment is handy and invaluable. They're so small that they're easy to lose, however. I misplaced my original, and I should have ordered two more instead of one!"
1,This item does not work for 2 GB Ipods,I spent quite a lot of time trying to figure out if this worked for a 2 GB Ipod as it was not very clear. At the end i had the feeling it did but it does not. I am now stuck with something I cannot use because it was not clearly indicated. I am not the first one apparently so I wonder why Amazon keeps not informating clearly its customers and I am quite unpleased with Amazon and Belkin :(as they don't seem inclined to do anything to compensate my loss and their lack of useful information.PS: the rate this item system should include a not recommended at all
1,Not worth the money,Drains battery life too quickly. Jams up the iPod too easily. When recording live music you end up with nothing but white noise. Worthless to me. I'm waiting to see how the Griffin voice recorder does when it comes out in April 04.
4,made in China,on the Case or the drill bits it does not say Bosch only on the packing material.Also the case is made in the USA but the bits are made in China and i was kinda disapointed in that fact...the bits are straight came in the right sizes and look nice.till now they are holding up. seems to be a good starter kitfor under $20 i recommend them
5,The Best Book About The Beatles' Music,"I read ""Tell Me Why"" years ago, and I still pick it up from time to time because it is an insightful, but not pedantic review of The Beatles' music, not their cultural or sociological significance, not their dirty laundry, not their relationship with each other and with the social discontent of the 1960s, etc. So much has been written about The Beatles, as phenomena, as cultural icons and almost everything imaginable, except there is a surprising scarcity of good criticism of their music, which after all of these years, has withstood the test of time. There is Wilfred Mellers' book ""Twilight of the Gods,"" but that is written from the perspective of a professor of classical music, and the results are amusing if not unintelligible. Riley is spot on with his insights into their music, and that is the only aspect of The Beatles that is meaningful to me."
5,It's About The Music,"Riley has given us a great gift - a way to listen to these familiar recordings with fresh ears. He sticks to the music itself (a real blessing) and opens up new points of insight and discussion about the Beatles as musicians (not pop icons or celebrities). As an example he convincingly makes the case that the often over-looked Ringo Starr is in fact one of the most musical drummers of the rock era. The technical side of the discussions are minimized although welcome to those with a little musical knowledge. You will not find a more thoughtful, intelligent and entertaining work about the Beatles' music."
1,"This book is terrible, let me Tell You Why","This book looks so deeply at the songs The Beatles wrote that it actually takes away from the magic of the music. The author grants such genius for the way someone claps on a backing track or offers a dull explanation of the teenage longing felt in the lyrics of some of their earlier songs. If The Beatles themselves had given this much thought to the music they were making then the magic would have surely been lost during the recording process. Even John Lennon thought the critical press overanalyzed their music on many occassions. He would probably turn over in his grave laughing at the amount of thought Tim Riley put into his song descriptions. Make no mistake, I am a huge Beatles fan and wanted to like this book. But I could not get through the boring overanalysis of each track by the author. He did something that I thought was impossible. Take the fun out of The Beatles music."
3,Pretty flimsey,"The rods were bent when I opened them. I was able to straighten them out but they are far too easy to bend. Also, the balls on the ends are made of cheap grey plastic."
4,Shipping,The product was easy to install & looked good. My problem was the shipping! I ordered four rods & they each came in a seperate box even though they could have been shipped in one box. The cost of the shipping was $26.26. The rods did not weigh heavy. I know I should have checked the shipping cost but coming from Amazon I guess I expected a fair price for the shipping.
2,Not What I Expected,"The balls look much cheaper in real life than they do online. If I had seen this in a store, I wouldn't have even considered it."
2,Bent and cheap,Arrived bent in packaging.. proceed to hang my drapes and it cant even hold them up. Only get for sheer or light drapes for a small window.
5,Addictive,Pokemon is An Addictive Game. There is only one way to make it stop nagging you and let your troubled mind be at peace. Beat the Game. This Book Will Help You it's worth the $15
4,Pretty good,"It has great info, but sometimes it is pretty vague, If you are under the age of 8 or 9, u might not understand it. I think it is pretty good and it also helped me out a lot."
1,bad,That book isnt even liscenced or official. I mean look at the horrible cover. What the heck is that? A deformed Charizard and Paras? Plus all of the information in it you can find at really good pokémon websites today.
4,"Everything you need, and an alphabetized Pokemon list.","It can be a pain to find certain pokemon in other guides because they sort them by their ID #, and not alphabetically. If you want a pokemon index that you can easily search through alphabetically, this book is for you."
4,This book is good but has quite a few mistakes !,well after reading this book i can tell you that it has very helpful maps and many mistakes.. other than that it is great and i deeply would recommend this book to anyone
1,lame,There is no information in this book. It merely spews out the stats for all the pokemon. How many places is this information available for free?
1,Misty is soooo FINE!!!!(in the cartoon),Nintendo's guide is WAAAAAAAYYY better!! HA HA! (Blastoise is the GREATEST!)
1,I do not like this book,"Hello people, I did not like this book becuase I found it very very boring, bought one in the U.S, (I live in Hong Kong.) I found it quite intresting at first but then my friend gave me the same thing! So I tried to sell it but in the end I had to stay with it and now I hardly even read it!"
3,Pokemon are the BEST!,"This is a good book, but it's bio section is messed up. On alot of the bios, the picture doesn't match the words or the words don't match the pokemon, but this book has lots of good information."
5,The Best pokemon book on the planet!!!!!!!!!!!,It has all the places to go and all the strategies.It also has a monster index of every pokemon.{even rare pokemon Mew}It tells you what pokemon are where and how much of a chance you have to catch it.I reccomend this book 100%.
3,Ive seen beter,The maps are helpfull but you will find mistakes like on Sabrinas pokemon it says betobeton.Also if you look at Nidoran (f) you find it eveolves into Nidoking.you will find many mystakes.
1,who the heck drew the cover?,Who the heck drew the cover? That doesn't look like a pokemon trainer or that a pokemon! That is sooo weird! Anyways this book isnt good. I bought another book and it was perfect! It told me EVERYTHING! But on this one it doesnt give you correct info.
4,"The first review of ""The Stranglers""","I lose interest in books quickly, so if they start out slowly, I don't finish 'em. The Stranglers, however caused me to lose some sleep. It got me hooked early and kept my interest til I finished it off. I enjoyed the authors use of western jargon and the little bit of history that he injected into the story. The story takes place in Montana circa 1880s where US Deputy/bounty hunter Page Murdock is after a small band of desperados who are torturing and killing the lawmen sent out to capture them. Murdock also runs into corruption and heroism as he attempts to subdue the villains. The story line is alittle predictable, but the characters Estleman introduces are likable, interesting or despicable enough to keep my interest. There is no romance in the book and some of the scenes are pretty graphic. The thing I appreciated most about the book was the way it moved along. It went from here to there quickly and characters died off at an alarming rate."
5,Food for the Pharohs,I received the book in a timely fashion. It was in excellent condition. I bought it as a gift. I looked through it briefly. I'm sure the recipient will enjoy it very much. I would definitely consider buying from this seller again.
2,A little better than her other book,"I bought this book and the author's previous book on the strength of reader reviews promising a funny and interesting book. What a disappointment! I found no true or original humor in it. I also noticed that the author hadn't kept track of details in the previous book - Kit's eyes changed from green to blue, and Jack Rhys' entire personality underwent a metamorphosis. This is not a polished product at all. I will not buy her books again."
5,A great read,"I stayed up half the night to finish this book, and boy am I glad I did even though I'm so tired today that I can barely stay awake! There wasn't a slow spot in the actionn at all. I am in love with Morgan and with this writer! Ms. MacGregor has a new fan who intends to buy everything she writes!"
1,Avoid this one!,"Terrible! Silly dialogue and an unbelievable story. The large typeface used in the printing makes you feel you are reading a grade school level book and the unrealistic plot furthers this feeling. I love historical romance novels - but definitely not this one! Better to spend your money on something by Lisa Kleypas, Julie Garwood or Julia Quinn."
2,Insane,"This book drove me absolutely insane. I only finished the book because I loved the hero Morgan Drake. Serenity made me want to rip this book apart, only it wasn't my book to destroy. The woman was infuriating, look I totally enjoy reading books where the women are independent but this was beyond sanity. Also as previous reviewers stated the ending was so RUSHED it didn't make any sense what-so-ever. The book I recommend is Master of Seduction Jakes story aka Jacob Dudley. Know that was a good book."
2,Made Me Gnash My Teeth,"Having read the positive reviews, I was thrilled to see a copy of this book at the used book store and snapped it right up. It's fair to say that the first two-thirds of this book were entertaining and enjoyable, but whoa...the last third was a major struggle. The hero, who'd spent years efficiently and ruthlessly freeing impressed Americans from the British Navy, became a wishy-washy (and drunken) wuss, the heroine became an unreasonable,unreasoning, unlikeable martyr, the secondary characters devolved into a bunch of comic buffoons and, most unforgiveably, the ending was flat AND pat. Even at half-price, it was a waste of money."
3,Hmmm...,"Not the best I've read. It does have a rather original and interesting plot, but it leaves somewhat to be lacking in the characters. If you can't find anything else to read, you might enjoy this."
3,Brillaint start-weakens thereafter,"""Ethnicolor"", ""ZOOLOOK'S"" opener, is an utter masterpiece and must've been one of the first all-sampled voice compositons, beating DEEP FORREST and DELERIUM'S music by almost a decade. The album is worth having for this piece alone, but unfortunately it's a steady decline from there. ""Diva"" is sassy, cute and goofy. Then there's the typical Jarre dance stuff (Zoolougie and Zoolook). ""Cafe Blah-Blah"" is a humorous bit, obviously inspired by the cantena scene in STAR WARS and could easily have been background music for that scene. Finally, we piddle out with ""Ethnicolor 2"" which seems tacked on for filler. The rest of the album isn't awful, it's just ""Ethnicolor"" is a such hard act to follow nothing else CAN match."
3,An Eclectic Jarre Production,"""Eclectic"" is the best word to describe this CD. ""Ethnicolor"" is an excellent job of mixing and dubbing and has that odd tempo that characterizes Jarre's work. Then there's ""Diva"", which is a real dog. He bounces back with ""Zookologie"" and ""Blah Blah Cafe"", but the consistency and flow that ties works like ""Oxygene"" and ""Equinoxe"" and ""Chronologie"" together is missing here. Still, an interesting CD and worthy of adding to your collection if you are an eclectic person."
5,Fantastic album,"This is Jarre's most innovative album. Although Oxygene and Equinoxe represent his true style Zoolook actually has real acoustic drums and a real bass guitar!! It's very funky, avant garde and brilliant. The sound recording is as always top!"
2,Zoolook,"Zoolook~ Jean-Michel Jarre is a case where the artist is way to avant-garde for his own best. After having made amazing albums such as Oxygene, Equinox and Magnetic Fields he unfortunately creates this mess of an album. I find it a bit too much like modern art, i.e., confusing, confounding and impossible to grasp. It also seems like Jarre was a bit over confident when he recorded this album. He had recorded some of the best synth albums of all time and decided to create a total arts album and it just does not work. This is an album that should have stayed unrealesed since it is just to avant-garde and sounds more like an experimental sound session rather then as a well produced album. Very disapointing indeed!"
5,Beatrix Potter,"Loved the book, it was just like the one I used to read to my daughter who is now expecting her first."
3,Doc 6 pocket expanding file,"product was ok. hard to get papers in and out as a) it's just a bit tight on either side, and b) the dividers within are fairly flimsy and don't provide enough support as i try to add and remove papers."
5,"Yes, this is the best Jarre album.","Not only is it one of the coolest, slickest pieces of music I own, it has a fantastic cover. The image is stereoscopic! Relax your eyes like you do for those Magic Eye images and the crowd on the cover has depth, getting further away towards the top. Absolute sonic perfection, I could not even think of one note to add, subtract or change to make this album better."
4,Strong Echo from the 70s,"Out of a junk pile of quadrophonic vinyl and 8-track tapes comes a Signal Triumph - Jarre's Equinox - which preserves the best of the 70s as a timeless Mighty Werlitzer from Outer-Inner Space. Buy this disk, slip on your headphones, and make this your own personal soundtrack."
5,One of Jarre's best albums.,"Equinoxe offers an escape from reality unlike any of his other albums. As all of Jarre's music is excellent, this is one of his best albums."
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"Through some manufacturing error, the CD I received was a 17 track""greatest hits"" collection (including some of his less desirable newer pieces).The CD box was labelled Equinoxe, the compact disc had an Equinoxe label, but that was not what was burned onto the CD."
1,Huh?,Seeing so many 5 star reviews for this CD is flat out laughable. I was disappointed that I couldn't give it zero stars. I am a long time electronic music fan but this CD is like one really long extended mix of some horribly cheesy TV show theme. Don't waste your money.
5,Not Just for Tree Huggers,"I was deeply inspired and moved by Ana Maria Spagna's essays set in or around Stehekin and the North Cascades National Park in Washington State. I've had a cabin in this area for over 30 years, but even if that weren't so, I'd still love this book! It is honest, witty, succint, insightful and of course, well written. Think Pam Houston (Cowboys are My Weakness, or, in this case, cowgirls) meets Anne Lamott (Travelling Mercies: Some Thoughts on Faith) with a little Whitman, Thoreau, and Emerson thrown in. Each essay kept me moving on to the next one, there are 17 in all. Some are really personal, others lighthearted. It is also great reading for anyone who loves the outdoors and nature. The references to Walden are to many to mention."
5,"As you read, you recognize yourself.","I couldn't stop reading--engaging, direct and heartfelt. If you have ever planned a wedding (or bar mitzvah...or commitment ceremony...or any public ritual), this is the book for you. We can all relate to the struggles and triumphs that come as you try to make a public celebration into a day that reflects who you are. The author draws you in with spirit, humour and wit.Amazing and strong."
4,Taste of wedding cake,"I went home and devoured the book - went to a concert at my church in between chapters and had the taste of wedding cake in my mouth. The personal nature of the ""journal entry"" chapters give an insight into love, exclusion, confusion, certainty, planning, joy. I found for me it highlights what being single has meant in the midst of a coupled/married Other."
3,In the house,"DJ Kool is the kind of DJ that scratches records in clubs, not the kind of DJ who plays records on the radio. This album features cuts recorded live at various night clubs around the country. It's not bad, but the songs have a sameness about them. Once you've heard one, you've pretty much heard them all. I should mention that the second version of ""Let Me Clear My Throat"" here features Doug E. Fresh and Biz Markie. Recommended for club kids only."
1,Awesomely bad,This has gotta be one of the most awesomely bad albums ever. all this guy does is fake cough & clear his throat. The monotony of the record and the fact that this DJ cannot be more inventive with his lyric with the exception of the AH AH AH AH AH. This rapper gets only one star and will soon appear on one of VH1's awesomely bad countdowns. stay tuned.
1,Please don't,"If you've looking for the best of British comedy, be assured that this is not it. This is crass, sexist and stupid. If you like that kind of thing, help yourself."
1,In Love and War by Stockdale,"I have to say that I am appalled by what I received. The book I see in the picture is NOT what I got. The book I ordered was said to be in ""Excellent condition"" and I paid $56.30, including shipping costs for a VERY OLD library book that the binding is broken in places and some of the pages have been glued in. One page is glued about 1/2 in up the page making it impossible to read the page. I feel that I have wasted $56.30. I wouldn't mind that the book is from 1989 if it was in good condition. If you wish I will take pictures and forward them to you so that you can see what I received. I still have the paperwork that came with the book. if any one wishes to see it."
2,CAUTION,THESE SMOKERS DO NOT FIT ALL WEBER GAS GRILLS!LIKE NUMEROUS OTHER ITEMS THE SPECS AND OR WHAT MODELS THEY FIT ARE NOT LISTED.
4,Liked it,"I really liked the main characters. The hero was very masculine and autocratic, but with a soft side. The heroine walked that fine line of strength and sensitivity. Well done but thought she could have benefited from being a little stronger, where he was concerned."
4,Nice colors not entirely functional,"The colors serve the intended purpose. I was very frustrated because the metal hooks slide out easily, making filing clumsy. Glue fixed this, but I shouldn't have to use glue to make them functional. After gluing, they are functional, and I appreciate the different colors."
5,Excellent Buy,"The book was in excellent condition. It was used but might as well have been brand new. Unbeatable price. Fast shipping, even at the basic level. Great plays."
1,basic,Only for the novice. A boring watch. Slow slow slooow. Poorly presented. What were you thinking Phil>?! Do not recommend.
3,"Good, but not great","I was disappointed in this book. I thought that it would be more of historical analysis of each fraternity/sorority, but yet it was nothing more of a dry recitation of facts The information that was presented is available on each sites website. I was looking for a more comprehensive view of each organization. There was also a number of errors throughout the book, that have been reported by other reviewers. I give the author props for tackling such a tough subject, but it just fell short of what I expected."
2,It left me asking even more questions....,I read the Divine Nine seeking detailed information about how all nine sororities and fraternities were started and about the founder's visions. But this source of information lacked in areas and left me asking more questions!!! I think if you truly wanted to know about a fraternity or a sorority you have to find the research yourself. This book was not a A+ but rather a C-!!
3,I was disappointed,"I felt that this book lacked a lot of information for some organizations, when it had enough for others. For example, i did not see information on the founders of Delta and Zeta, when there was information for AKA and SGRho. Also, in the end of the book when it gave the general info about each organization, there were some organizations that he didn't even fill out half a page for when others had 1+ pages. I felt cheated. I expected more from this book, and received less."
3,Lacks Analysis,"This book presents the histories of black sororities and fraternies, but does not include any analysis of the groups. What about class and colorism? Do Greek organizations benefit blacks or encourage divisions? The work does include an amazing amount of information and will be of particular interest to members of these groups. But Paula Gidding's history of Delta Sigma Theta is a better examination of the contributions of sorors."
3,"Good idea, but some errors","This book is a good brief review of BGLO, but I found several errors. Dr. David Satcher, who was President of Meharry and currently the U.S. Surgeon General was placed on the prominent members of Kappa Alpha Psi list. Dr. Satcher was not a Kappa, he pledged Omega Psi Phi Fratewrnity, Inc. at Morehouse College, Psi Chapter."
2,Distorted and Missing Facts,"While this book provides an account of information to potential pledges, before joining one of the Divine Nine...it is full of bad/false information. I don't understand how you got published without fact checking of such high standing organizations. I'm equally appalled as to how you depicted the history my beloved Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority. I understand your had a bias because of personal life, but you are an Alpha man and I really expected FACTS an integrity.Clean it up, publish a second edition."
4,Nice...,I was pleasantly surprised to see that this book was written without bias and did an adequate job of providing information on the 'divine nine'. I think it's wonderful that a person can pick this book up as a resource of the historical backgrounds of our cherished greek organizations.
4,Someone interested in greek life,I have just read Mr. Lawrence Ross book. There was a lot of information that I didn't know. I am seriously interested in a sorority not to be named. What disturbed me about the book was that only A Phi A and AKA were on the cover of the book and also that more information was given about the two organizations than any other. No disrespect intented but there are nine fraternities and sororities. I did enjoy reading this book and it reaffirmed why I want to become a member of a certain sorority. Thank you very much Mr. Ross for providing this information.
3,"First of it's kind, but a few errors","This book is a good brief summary of the nine major African American fraternities and sororities. I found several errors.Dr. David Satcher, who was president of Meharry Medical College and is now the United States Surgeon General was listed on the prominent members of Kappa Alpha Psi list. He was not a Kappa, he was a member of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity. Dr. Satcher was initiated at Morehouse College's Psi Chapter."
3,Good but could be better,"This book overall is great for someone interested in anj African-American Fraternity/Sorority. There are only a few downsides which include the distracting pieces of information about famous members on various pages. The profiles of these people should've had its own chapter. I also believe that the author has biased views since he is an Alpha and his wife is a Delta. I couldn't get over what he said about him thinking of Deltas when he thinks of the future and other similar staements (I probably misquoted but if you read the book you know what I mean). I understand he is entitled to his own opinion, but this book is suppose to be about history and facts. Leave the opinions out of it especially if you are obviously favoring one sorority/fraternity over the other. But overall it gave a good amount of history. I learned a lot by reading it."
4,Divine Nine- An Insightful book,"The Divine Nine gives an insightful outlook as to the historyof the Divine Nine organizations. I recommend this book to anyone who is a prospective member, or a Greek member of such institutions."
3,Too many errors,"This book is a good idea, but the author needs to revise it and print a second edition. Here are some of the many errors:1. Dr. David Satcher who was the president of Meharry Medical and currently the U.S. Surgeon General is not a Kappa, but an Omega man, who was initiated at Morehouse College's Psi Chapter of Omega Psi Phi.2. DeHart Hubbard was not the first African American to represent the U.S. in the olympics, George Poage was the first and John Taylor was the first to win a gold medal. It should of said ""DeHart Hubbard - The first African American to receive an individual Olympic gold medal, 1924.""3. George L.-P. Weaver was not a U.S. Secretary of Labor, he was ""U.S. Assistant Secretary of Labor for International Affairs, 1961-1969.""4. The AKA hymn was also misquoted.5. Herman Dreer's book is not from 1911-1961, but from 1911-1939."
4,No complaints,"My son read the book. He did not have any complaints, so I guess the book was good. Thank you."
5,sonoran desert picker,This album is straight from the sixties. It will bring back good memories of the 60's and 70's. or maybe not.
4,"Pretty cool, huh?",This is the best of the garage bands of the 60's who made it across the lines of insanity. You gotta hear it to believe it!!
1,Vague and Tangental,"This is a text book for my current anatomy class and I don't like it. Several reasons - 1)It's vague. It will begin to describe on thing and then just drop it like a hot potato and go to a new subject. 2) The author tends to get so off-subject that mid-chapter I will have to flip back and remind myself what the focus of the chapter is supposed to be. 3) I hate it when books say ""But we will discuss this in more detail in Chapter Whatever"" or ""We will return to this subject in more detail later"" and this author is guilty of doing this often."
5,A must have and read by any Christian who desires to grow in God,"I have read many of Dr Varner's books and listened to many of his messages. This book, PREVAIL, is a great book. All you need to know as biblical foundational truth to ground and establish you in Christ is here presented by Dr Varner. Living as overcomer has being mis-interpreted by many christians. Many people have their own idea or apologetics on what it is to be an overcomer. Here Dr Varner presented, in a language that is easy to understand, the biblical truth regarding how every christain can see who he/she is in Christ Jesus and how growth and development to maturity in the Kingdom of King Jesus (to become like Jesus) is catalized or intiated by the daily pressures (tribulations) that we go through.The book is trully a handbook for the Overcomer. You need to get it, read/study it and catch the spirit of it not just the letter."
4,Narnia...,"As a longtime fan of the books, I was excited to see the film version of ""The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe"". The film is practically a blueprint of the book, with minor changes, but nothing too altering. The idea of finding a magical land, and being a child again, and good beating out evil...it's all there.I would like to mention though that the widspread problem of the missing booklet was QUITE a hassle....If anyone else had this problem, call the Disney phone number that's listed in the link to the photo of the booklet in product details, or else you'll have the problem I did: A Christmas present missing a piece, many emails back and forth to Amazon customer service, a replacement DVD sent STILL missing the booklet, returns, and eventually finding out I could get the booklet sent to me for free anyway. Better late than never, I suppose."
4,"Mandarin Chinese edition ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe""",The voice over actors/actresses definitely have mainland accents. I just wish the Chinese subtitles matched the Mandarin audio. The missing star is for the mismatch on the subtitles.
3,poor packaging,"My dvd arrived promptly, but the packaging was badly damaged. I shook it and thought the dvd was broken because it was not fixed firmly in place. When opened, the dvd seemed scratched, but upon playing it, I found it was okay. I rated this purchase okay, because I feel it should have been packaged more securely."
4,Very good,"I never thought this movie would be good. I thought it was going to be boring as all getout, but I was wrong. This movie was really really good. It grabbed my attention from the start. I loved the storyline and the message behind it. This is a must see movie."
2,Not for fans of the books!,"Unfortunately in what I see as a short sighted money grab by Disney they have ruined perhaps the only remake we are likely to see for the next ten years, of this classic story. The original story has been secularised to remove the underlying Christian theme of the book, which has resulted in a poor version of an otherwise deeply rich classic. Such a shame they didn't find someone like Peter Jackson to make this! Unfortunately this is the best out of the three Disney remakes, the others being progressively worse. Bright and Disneyfied, the impression becomes one of a made for tv movie, especially in the later movies. How sad:( the worst thing is it is unlikely to be remade for a very long time, and people think they know the story now through these films but really won't. As for those who say its very close to the book, maybe a reread will be helpful."
1,Amazon failures,Most dissapointed customer for receiving blank CDs. I have returned and demanding replacement. I hope they will owner the customer service policy to correctly meet customer needs as ordered.
2,The Chronicles of Yawnia,"Let me begin by saying that I have never read the books this theatrical release is based on and that I am not enticed to do so now. I found this movie to be a serious disappointment. The plot was meandering and the characters were unappealing. The special effects were marginal and the movie was too long for small children and too juvenile for adults. Honestly, I heard the children sitting behind me ask their mother to leave before the film was over at least a dozen times. I also had problems with the philosophical message of the story. It basically endorses ""the divine right of kings"" and the existence of a ruling elite who hold their place by destiny, rather then achievement. I know it is just a film and that it is meant to be fun, but it felt like a propaganda piece to me.Admittedly, I did like some of the white queens dresses."
2,Might please 5 year olds,"I never read the books, nor did I have any idea that the movie and/or books were supposed to be a christian allegory. Therefore I did not have any preconceived ideas or expectations and merely looked at it as a new and highly touted fantasy movie. I was bored to tears. This movie including the fantasy creatures and ""battle"" scenes are a bad rip-off of the excellent ring trilogy. The acting is horrible, wooden and emotionless. The kids seem to be reading their lines of cards while staring in the camera. Not one of them had any appealing quality. Background looks fake, especially watching on a large TV. And why are certain animals good and others bad??? Who came up with this crazy idea? Maybe 5-8 year old might like it if they can manage to stay awake during the first 45 minutes."
1,I don't know how faithful Disney's version of the modern day classic novel by C.S Lewis but I found this movie dreadfully boring,"The only reason I watched it is because my sons, especially my youngest, loved the book when he was a teenager. It was a hour before it started getting interesting. At least after that it was good eye candy. I found the boy Edmund a brat who would never deserve to be named king of anything except nothing. I admit, I couldn't wait for it to be over."
3,"Good acting, great special effects, but too truncated","This film version has the outer trappings of the great story, but it is so shortened that it loses a large part of its soul. In the book, the characters are important and have intricate relationships, which are successfully portrayed in the BBC version. However, the Disney version cuts most of it out, except for the extremely obvious. So what is left is an adventure, with baddies warring against the goodies. The last quarter of the film is the battle itself, which is graphically violent and excessively detailed. The digital effects are quite spectacular, but again, this masks a rather hollow core. What you end up with is a visual spectacle that disappoints if you want the deeper themes that are in the books.Recommended tepidly, as a pass time but not a literary experience. As the recent Lord of the Rings Trilogy shows, a film version can succeed as a literary experience."
3,If you've read and loved the Narnia Chronicles...give this version a miss.,"This may actually be a good movie, as movies go.But as an adaptation it suffers from an attempt to turn Narnia into another Harry Potter/Lord of the Rings epic series. The intimacy and immediacy of the original - the perspective - were lost, with little to show for it.Some of the CGI is also painful to watch.And ""no,"" I never saw the BBC adaptations - I didn't know they existed until now."
4,A Marvelous Metaphorical Cinematic Creation for All,"The Computer Generated Effects are astonishing. I enjoyed the World War II sequence in London and as was the practice, if possible, to move children (the central protagonists) to the countryside which was not the usual target of the Nazis. I loved the slow and methodical buildup as the four Pevensie children eventually discover a secret passage into NARNIA an extra-dimensional Kingdom where good and evil struggle. If you are unfamiliar with the story it is unfair to say more. The landscapes, colors, music and the overall atmosphere are all very beautiful. I was very moved."
5,Great Film!,"I was a fan of the books as a child and was very pleased with how the movie was handled! The acting of the children was wonderful! Lucy particularly stole the show!I also enjoyed the special effects of the movie. I love how the graphics really just added to it, rather then the movie being all about the special effects. For example, when we meet Tumnus his legs seem so natural that we can focus on him as a character. And little details like him stomping his feet when he comes inside from the snow are priceless!Aslan, and the whole battle sequences looked fantastic! The Gryphon was breathtaking. Unfortunately I felt the fox, and in some parts the wolves did not hold up to the same standards. (not to say they were bad, just not as good)The battle went by quickly, leaving you wanting to see more. (in some ways this is good, it didn't drag) For sure something that will be fun to pause and inspect in more detail on DVD!Very fun, worth every penny!"
4,Mostly Satisfying,"I'm a Narnia fan, so perhaps I'm biased, but I think the extended edition is wonderful. The additions are subtle, mostly consisting of more landscape shots, but there is one sweet moment on the train in the beginning that you should watch for. The extra cinematography is fantastic; it really highlights the beauty of the Narnia they created. The only disappointments to me are that they did not add the coronation ball from which there are outtakes, and they did not use the extended version of the reunion scene between Lucy and Tumnus, which has been on the internet, but not placed in its context within the movie.I can't say much about the extras because I haven't watched them ALL yet, but I watched part of the movie-with-explanation, and it seemed like it is going to be very interesting to watch.And of course, room has been made on my bookshelf for the bookends..."
4,"Great Bonus Features, Movie Not Much Different","The idea of advertising this as having ""extra scenes"" is a bit ludicrous as the extra film footage mostly consisted of extended battle scenes and extensions on a few other scenes. These extensions disrupted the smooth flow of the movie a small bit but not enough that your average movie-goer would notice. The behind-the-scenes footage was fascinating although, it did tend to repeat bits from one segment to another. In general I would say, if you only want one copy of the movie buy this one but unless you are a buff seeking to fill out your production knowledge of this film, the special edition is not worth hunting down. (That said, I will probably be holding out for the special edition on the sequels.)"
3,"nice effects, but no substance","book was great, movie not so much so. major let down... very slow start, then no details during the movie."
4,An epic,The chronicals of Narnia is an epic adventure. The battle scenes are big and the special effects are great. Some points of the movie is too slow and some scenes could easily scare young children.
3,Christian entertainment,"As a biblical allegory, the movie works quite well, making it's points more entertainingly and artistically than a straightforward bible story would. If, however, one wants to know how it works as stand-alone entertainment for a non-Christian child, you would be well advised to look elsewhere.The Christian references are too obvious to be anything else, and the characters are created to be representative of a religious lesson instead of just a children's story, and it shows. The children are in many ways unlikeable and two-dimensional and the dialogue self-righteous. Tilda Swinton is riveting as a witch creepy and vicious enough to scare adults, let alone children. An older child will find both humor and adventure lacking, while a younger child will probably find all the violence frightening."
2,What were they thinking?,"This movie was not anywhere near as good as it could have been.There are so many problems with this movie. The kids don't even act amazed when they enter Narnia. They act like they see fauns and talking beavers every day. The beavers look like giant rats. You can easily tell what was CG and what was not. I have no idea why they got Andrew Adamson to make this movie. He made Shrek and Shrek 2. Why not get a qualified director. Narnia also seems to be an island where you can get everywhere in a day or two. The kids go all over Narnia in a day or two. And why does the professor look like the KFC guy?There are some good things in this movie though. Aslan looks great and Liam Neeson was the right voice. Parts of the battle also looked good but, this was a failure. This could have been great but it isn't. What were they thinking?"
5,The best movie ever,"To begin whith the movie was great. I loved all the characters that you had.Lucy is a great actress also Susan Edmund and Peter they all acted out their parts perfect.When their were sad they looked like their were sad and when their happy they looked like their happy.Also the scenery.It was so very butifull,exspecialy when it had a colorful sky at dawn.Finally the best part I like about it was the story line .It was good,and the least thing i liked about it was there was a lot of things that were diferent from the book to the movie.But it was still a great movie, I loved it."
4,the lion the witch and the wardrobe,"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe is a really great movie.It was extremly funny at points and then there was a few parts were it was horribly boring but in the end it turned out to be a great movie.I remember when my friend and I were watching it and the little dwarf dude came on when Edmund came to the witches house and asked for more turkish delight and the little dwark guy came out and said ""this way to your num numz"" It was so hilarious any time that guy is on the screen you hsve to laugh.the lion the withc and the wardrobe was prabally one of the best fantsy movies i have ever seen and that is a good thing because i do not really like to watch fantasy moveis ."
5,Best One of the Three they have made yet!,"I thought that this movie was very well acted and very well done. It's very neat and it looks real, unlike the old English version. We have had the disc for 6 years, and it still is in good condition. The entire family loved it. ( even are 3-year-old got a little exited!)"
5,Classic Tale,This movie faithfully portrays the story from the book. There is enough violence that you should consider the age of the viewers.
5,A great movie!,I have enjoyed this movie whenever I could find it on TV... Now I own it and can watch it any time. This is such a wonderful movie and is good for the whole family.
5,Great Movie,"I'm 4th grade. I like the movie. I figured out the message. Aslan is Jesus, Lucy and Susan are the 2 apostles that saw Him die and rise, the mice were the angels, the White Witch is the Devil's Wife, Edmund was the people who turned against Jesus, and the dwarf who drove her sleigh was the Devil.The pictures were good. I'd recommend it for all ages."
4,Great Movie,This was a great movie that my whole family enjoyed. I think its suitable for a mature 8 year old and up.
4,Great Movie,"I have been a fan of the series ever since the animated version of the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe was made. Since then I kept up with the BBC productions and have read all the books. The movie was outstanding, and can easily compare with a wide variety of other fantasy movies. My only concern with this movie is that it should have had a sort of prologue or recap on Jadis' and Narnia's origins (from the book The Magician's Nephew). Even though a recap was not included in the actual book (none was needed because it was well understood when we read the entire series) it would have helped explain some of the questions people who are new to the story might have had. All in all, great movie."
5,Completely Satisfied,I've been looking forward to seeing this film for months. I read the books and watched study versions of the educational films as a child. It's been years but the stories have always held a special place in my heart. The children were wonderful actors; the sets were beautiful; the special effects were excellent. Everything fit together perfectly. I was completely inthralled. I'll be rushing to buy this on dvd when it is released so I can watch it again and again. It's inspired me to dig out my book so I can read the complete works.
3,Good Movie but you may get lost in C.S. Lewis's Metaphors,"'The Chronicles of Narnia' is film written and based upon the christian fictional literature and writings of C. S. Lewis. For those who are fans of works such as 'The Screwtape Letters' in which a demon and a demon in training is explaining how to overcome humanity with the temptations of evil, basicallyteaching christians vividly the assaults of the Devil against the people of God might see this movie as a watered-down version like the Stars Trilogy dealing with the controversy between Christ and Satan.But most might get lost in the metaphors of C. S. Lewis and might see this film as a feeble attempt to do a 'Harry Potter' for those born-again. It is all a matter of perspective and also your knowledge of the Bible in understanding the symbolisms."
2,Well Made But Uninteresting Movie.,"This is one of those movies in which I have made many attempts to watch. I actually saw it in the theater and fell asleep several times. Well, I bought the 4 disc DVD set and I have to admit, after several tries, I just cant' get into it.It's not as if it's a poorly made movie. Narnia looks great! Unfortunately nothing happens there that is worth remembering. The acting isn't bad either. Just unfortunately I did not finding myself caring about any of the kids or anything that happened to them. And unlike many villains both literary and cinematic, I did not find myself dreading Jadis, the ice queen. Likewise, I could not find myself able to cheer for Aslan and his triumph over the white witch. I really wanted to. I just didn't care one way or another.I found the bonus material much more satisfying to watch than the movie itself. I understand a sequel to this movie currently in production. I do hope they make a more compelling movie next time."
1,No Spanish or subtitles available for this DVD,"Please be advised that even though product description indicates it has Spanish audio and subtitles, this is not correct. The one I ordered shows a lion on the front, but the one I received shows a queen and the British BBC logo. It's fine for me, but my family won't be able to enjoy it in Spanish."
3,A Kid's review,"It was good visually otherwise it was super boring. Because the action was too slow, like every 5 minutes...it was also disturbing with all those disgusting creatures...only the lion and the witch looked normal.....made no sense...the lion had a kingdom of weird creatures whom the humans became kings over....weird...and confusing....no storyline...I'll get back to the new Clash of the titans...."
5,very happy,I was very happy with the movie and the speedy service. The movie came quickly and I enjoyed watching it.
5,Magical and Whimsical,"While not 100% accurate to the story, it keeps what is important and it does what is important: it keeps the spirit of the story. While every detail is not paid attention to and some things are added while others omitted, the awe and wonder of Narnia is there."
4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"I love when they take a favorite childhood story of mine and adapt it to the big screen. I am always a little weary when it's Disney thou. You never know what Disney is going to do with it, however in the case of The Lion, The Witch, & The Wardrobe, is a homerun. They didn't shorten this film into some hour and a half movie about love. They took their time and told the story as it was meant to be told. All the kids were new to the big screen and were terrific. It's a classic tale that is over 60 years old and it's as fresh and relevant today as it was then. Two big thumbs up for the first of the Narnia tales, personally I hope they make all seven of them into feature films!"
5,Narnia,This is a perfect film. With a perfect cast and a wonderful understanding of the original 'magic' of Narnia. C.S. Lewis would be proud and Walden Media did a great job.
4,Really Really Good show,Really Really Good show ......We enjoyed it a good family film with values added!We've seen it before years ago & it was like seeing it for the first time again.
2,Extended scene!?!,"The extended version is only aprox. 15 min. longer than the theatrical version. I noticed that the time for the longer one is omited from the Amazon specs. The only way to tell is by going to the store and look at the small print on each of them. Man the Fellowship of the Ring is enhanced by 30 min. this ""new and improved movie"" just looks like tripple dipping by the studio!! What a bunch of felgercarb.This is such a great movie but the studio blew it with this version."
5,Excellent extras make this a must-have for the film's fans,"The ""extended version"" isn't as long as the Lord of the Rings stuff but it has a couple nice bits here and there (more of the battle, bit more of Edmund and the Witch). The second disc has lots of nice documentaries and behind the scenes stuff. The third disc provides an excellent look at CS Lewis' life and how he created the entire Narnia saga. The fourth disc is the best as it takes the ""audio commentary"" a step further by showing the theatrical cut of the film alongside clips of the shooting of the film, effects work, wardrobe, comments and more. It's an amazing experience that enhances the movie wonderfully. Even if you have the 2-disc version, the fourth disc on this set makes it a must-have."
5,"Great film, pretty faithful to the book.","I gotta say, there have definitely been a lack of decent movies lately. It seems to be all immature teenage comedies, lousy remakes of old classics, or stupid horror films. For me, Narnia was an amazingly fresh and enjoyable movie. You probably know the plot by now, and the film stays pretty true to the book. However, the kids wanting to go back home and Aslan's attitude toward the Witch ticked me off. The cinematography, acting, costumes, and effects all come together to portray a true world. That's the highest praise I can give a film. Can't wait for the next one, and I hope Hollywood acutally starts making some more good movies someday soon. Cheers."
4,4-Disc Extended vs. 2-Disc Theatrical,"I just wanted to clarify to potential buyers that the 4-disc version includes ALL of the special features that are included in the 2-disc version as well as several additional features and the slightly longer cut of the film. So if you are a die-hard fan, there is no reason to purchase the 2-disc version if you own the 4-disc version. I personally rate the quality of the film 3 1/2 stars."
5,"The Chronical of Narnia - The Lion, the witch and the waredrobe",I have seen this movie several time. I liked so much that I gave if as a Christmas present to the sister of my God daughter.
5,Chronicles of Narnia,We hadn't watched any of the Chronicles movies as our kids were too young. We bought these two movies and watched them right away and our kids loved them. The price was good too.
5,"for ""Passion of the Kitty Cat.""","This movie was excellent, although I would recommend that the viewers read the books as well. As several of the reviewers pointed out, there were artistic changes in the plot that detracted from the fullness of the characters. In addition, for the reviewer mentioned in the subject line, please read The Magician's Nephew, which is actually the prequel to The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe. Then you will know whence came the wardrobe. For some reason, this book isn't as well known as the sequels."
4,Slightly Above Average,"This movie was excellent but in my opinion was missing key elements of the book, especially during battle scenes and other scenes with Lucy and Edmund. Overall, very well done. Wonderful special effects."
1,Unoriginal and preachy.,"This story is one of the worst ""fantasy"" stories ever. It is completely unoriginal and is a hodge podge of borrowed fantasy and mythological creatures set in a preachy judeo-christian story line. Don't waste your time with the books or the movies and look to Lord of The Rings or Harry Potter for original (not to mention secular) fantasy and escape."
3,"Lord of Rings no, Harry Potter Yes","whether or not this is a good film,, ahhh. I saw it with no pre disposition. I thought it was great kid fare but it ends there,, if the religious right loves this then they should have no problem with Harry Potter and sorcery in general. This is not a Lord of the rings movie which LOTR is an adult film with real death and fighting, this is bloodless and censored. I thought the best in the film was the youngest girl in the family, her performance stood out for me"
3,I grew up with this story,"And I love it just as much now as I did while still a kid. The special effects are the main draw here. The movie isn't bad but I feel as though the filming had to be a bit rushed. My main and biggest example of this comes just after aslan is sacrificed. One minute the stone table is surrounded by an army of the white witch's monsters but 2 seconds later, they're all gone. That little detail REALLY broke up the flow for me. At least in the old british version there was the transitional scene where you saw a few monsters running away before you see the stone table and aslan again.Overall, I'd say this movie could have been better, but it's still worth a look as it is..."
2,Disappointing movie,"I haven't read the book, so I don't know how faithful it is to it. But I was very disappointed in the movie.I had heard of it as a Christian allegory. It includes what is essentially a crucifixion and resurrection scene (the lion Aslan agrees to be killed to save the life of Edmund, a boy portrayed as a traitor), but this seems awkwardly placed in an otherwise secular action movie. It just doesn't fit. This was the major source of my disappointment in the movie. On the whole the movie did not seem to me to represent Christian values, and the crucifixion and resurrection bit semed quite discordant with the rest of the movie.The acting was generally good, with the two young actresses playing the two girls offering particularly outstanding performances. But it was basically a fairly run-of-the-mill action movie with the discordant Christian reference just plopped into it."
3,boring,"The humans were not lovable or respectable, nor did I see any reason why they should be honored. Yet the were crowned, and then weakly led a rebellion. The movie was weak."
2,It Looks like Lord of the Rings meets the Wizard of Oz- But It doesn't Top them,"Walt Disney Pictures released a blockbuster movie of C.S. Lewis' classic novel from the Chronicles of Narnia series ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Alot of people loved it, but I thought it was an all right movie, the best film of 2005 and that I have ever seen is ""KING KONG"" the battle sequences are cool, it's Lord of the Rings like, but overall it's all right."
5,WONDERFUL!!!,"At a time in which Hollywood considers it ""progressive"" to applaud and reward raunchier and raunchier movies, what a WONDERFUL treat it was to see a movie full of good values, good morals, good language...all in all, a movie for the entire family to enjoy! The story is superb, the graphics are superb, the acting is superb...and I can't wait for the next installment.You do not have to be a Christian to enjoy this movie. If you are a Christian, you will see parallels to stories from the Bible. If you are not a Christian, or cannot find the parallels, this takes nothing away from the movie itself.An all-around GREAT family movie!!"
4,Chronicles of Narnia,"This movie has gorgeous scenery and music,and the actors and actresses ewere very talented. The scenes and effects of World War II were detailed, and though the beavers did not look realistic,their simple animation seemed to fit their comical role. However, though the graphics for the White Witch's army were very advanced, this made the monsters look very graphic. Also, though the pace was fast, it seemed rather abrupt.Overall, this is a creative movie that would appeal to a wide variety of audiences, as it has both ''family scenes'' and action."
2,Soylent Dick Says: Another Great Story Ruined by Disney,"Disney should never be allowed got their hands on these kinds of stories!Amongst a heap of other abuses: The dungeon scene (where Edmond meet Tumnus & we see the witch turn Tumnus into stone) doesn't exist in the book.None of the four kids can act for toffee.Too much time was spent on the journey to meet Aslan (creating absurd scenes which don't exist in the book)Tilda Swinton didn't look the part of the witch. She smiled too much. Apart from her hair being the wrong colour, the witch needs to be tall and thin. The main characteristics of her personality are cold authority and economy. Although she conveys hatred, she never speaks unless necessary.Apart from that, the final battle scene looked to me more like a stupid fight scene from a Lord of the Rings movie."
2,Why is everyone in this movie so darn ugly?,"I guess good looking Britain's don't become actors. This is just another movie that gets tons of ""hype"" put out about it and then it just becomes another kiddy fantasy with talking animals and hairy half-humans.Even the ""white queen"", the adult actor of this film is so butt ugly! Isn't she the same ugly wench that played the angel in ""Constantine?"" If they have gotten Elizabeth Hurley to play the role, that might have enhanced the appeal of this movie a tad.Disney seems to like to get British children for their films. It's really beginning to get old. Or maybe I'm just getting too old, and I'm just getting tired of the same old predictable casting happenstance."
2,Just not very good,"I hate to say it, but this cinematic spin on C.S. Lewis' masterpiece is simply overrated. While the film version will entertain a younger audience and simultaneously teach positive values, isn't it better for the children to be reading the book anyway? From an execution standpoint the film was flimsy and transparent. The kids acted their hearts out, but sometimes heart doesn't make up for lack of refinery. The visual effects were stunning, yet typical. The filmmakers were obviously trying to ride in on the winds of the Lord of the Rings blockbuster, and were able to post good numbers at the box office by doing so, but the Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe will not perevere through time. All in all, you probably should see it if you need to keep up with the other soccer moms in gossip hour, or if your child won't behave until you do (and they've read the book!!)."
2,A very boring Fantasy film,"There are no spoilers here in this review except for the fact that I found this film extremly dissapointing. The story has many plot holes and is not engaging. The characters are generic and lack motivation. The visual effects were less than standard. Most of the animals (For the exception of the Lion)looked really fake and it was really easy to spot ""green screen"" shots. Most actors did a fine job with the huge exeption of the kids who never seem to realize what a big deal it was to be in a fantasy world or to fight a war. But the biggest problem was the story which was genric, boring and without a purpose. For people who are not fans of the book save yourselves the time and skip this one and wait until it airs on the Disney channel."
1,This Is Why I Should NOT Buy New DVDs Too Early,"This 4-disc edition is the reason why I should NOT buy new DVDs too early. I really love this movie and I pre-ordered the 2-disc edition as soon as it became available. Boy, I was WRONG!!! I should NOT have done that. I hate the movie studios that do this kind of thing; releasing a 2-disc edition and a few months later releasing a 4-DISC EDITION! Bummer!!!"
4,great product great service,loved the moviegreat color and soundreceived it super-fast!!!thank you!!this vendor is greatd
1,Disgust,Since I seem to be deviating from the popular opinion of this forum- I'll stay to the point. The book is excellent. I'm still waiting for Disney to send me a refund for the 2+ hours of my life that I wasted on this transparent/uninspiring garbage that someone has called a movie.
3,Narnia is Just an Appetizer Before the Main Dish...KING KONG,"I enjoyed this film having never read the books because I love fantasy films, but it was a little on the childish side. It was more like Harry Potter than Lord of the Rings, so I guess I was expecting too much going in. It is worth seeing with younger kids, but I personally can't wait for King Kong."
3,"good film and well adapted but lacking some thing, and i dont apreciate the chrstian under tone","Why is that all these fantasy films try to include everything from the book. This is a wellmade extremly faithful adaption of the book. Bu ti have ben here before, with The Lord Of The Rings, with the superb King Kong remake. The absolute need to put every element of the story dragged it down slowed th pace and god help me i feel asleep. The casting was spot on. The four pensive children were perfect. Tilda Swinton as The White witch topnotch. But also the movie has an overt chritin tiklt to it and i dontlik being preached too. Seperation of church and state folks."
3,Rather bland...,"I am surprised that many rated this 5 stars. Though the story line is great but many scenes are choppy and unless you've read the book, some scenes don't make sense. For example, the sudden appearance of 'Santa Claus'? Aside from Lucy the little girl and Tumnus the fawn, the actors and actress of the movie seem woody and inexperienced, its like watching a school play."
1,LOL this is a fantasy epic?,I fell in love with the chronicals of narnia when I was a young child. This movie does the book no justice at all. The computer animations are horrible and nothing near as good as the creatures on Peter Jackson's The Lord of the rings. The actors are terrible and given a terrible script to learn. There is no warmth or love between the children making this movie very boring and annoying to watch. Aslan the lion is portrayed as a real wimp in this movie. The costumes especially the white witch's costume look horrible. I'd say as bad as something from a cheap community play. I do not suggest you waste your money on this atrocious movie unless you are such a huge fan of the C.S. Lewis series and your children don't know any better. Maybe little kids would love this. Who knows for sure. I didn't like this boring and dull movie.
1,Lousy,"This is a lousy movie and does not follow the book. As an adaption and an individual movie, it doesn't capture the world of C. S. Lewis. The acting is terrible, (especially the casting of the white witch..... I thought she was supposed to be scary) and many of the shooting styles were stolen from lord of the rings. I can only hope that ""Prince Caspian (coming out in a few years) will be an improvement. However if Andrew Adamson is still directing it probably will be just as bad."
1,Incredibly Overrated,"What happened? They really screwed this up big time. I was bored to tears! And Santa? Why in the world would they put Santa in there? They tried WAY too hard. Go for ""King Kong"" as the winter film of 2005."
1,disppointing,"With Harry Potter as a scale, this movie doesn't come close and isn't worth the purchase. The only thing that makes the movie tolerable is the special effects, but the main boy character is weak, the usual villain is a boy, and the girls are innocent, strong, and smart while boys are portrayed weak, liars, and unsure. Not good role models for boys or girls.The performance of the Wicked Witch was great.The predictable Disney happy ending agaisnt monsterous odds has gotten old."
2,Hardly Extended,"I am writing this review simply based on the ""Extended"" movie as I have not gotten to the extras. After all, people ultimately buy DVDs for the movie and not entirely for the extras.I am quite confused as to how this new edition differs from the original theatrical release. I saw a few extra scenes in the beginning of the children walking around, but there is nothing substantial added. The battle at the end is a bit longer, but the changes overall were so small that you really have to know the original very well to spot all the minor additions. I am not even sure if there was any new dialog.Perhaps the extras will redeem the set, but if you already own the movie (particularly the other special edition), I do not see a need to buy this one."
4,"a nice transfer, good blu-ray and an ok movie","I didn't enjoy this movie as much as I did the first time I saw it. However the Blu-ray is a very nice transfer and if you're a fan of the film, it won't disappoint. It's a very nice upgrade from the dvd."
4,A Magical Movie!,"The Narnia movies are well made and enjoyable for anyone who enjoys stories about things from the realm of imagination! The directing, photography, casting, and everthing is well done. I didn't give it a 5 star only because the story itself is not one of my all time favorites, but the movies is fun to watch."
5,chronicles of narnia,The movie in interesting with a Christian sense about it.# siblings are sent to a safe area during a war.They find a wardrobe in the house while playing.The other side of the wardrobe leads to a magical adventure.this is a good family movie.
5,Awesome movie!,"My son and I read the books The Magicians Nephew and The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe over the summer in anticipation of the movie. And as expected, we thought the movie was great! The computer effects are good, some parts could be better but this movie really was great, in spite of that. I am hopeful that other CS Lewis stories can be brought to screen. Aslan is very much a Christ-like character that sacrifices himself for others. And the white witch is a temptress much like Satan. The actress who plays the white witch does an excellent job of capturing the subtle evilness of the character! We will definitely be seeing this again. This movie might be appropriate for children that is around 8 years and above. Young children might be frightened from the sound and scenes. This movie is a great follow-up to reading the Narnia books and the book ""Mere Christianity"" by CS Lewis."
4,Narnia,"The only reason I bought this particular Narnia DVD was b/c I saw on tv that Disney was going to put it in the vault, so I had to get it before it disappeared and it was a good price for all the special features and everything. I like the box design, it's very cool. I love the movie. Special features are pretty cool if you're that much of a fan, if not, just get the simple DVD."
1,Disaster,"This was not a good movie. Why Andrew Adamson?There are so many better directors out there.This was a disaster. Watch this and then watchThe Lord of the Rings, King Kong, or Star WarsEpisode 3. All of which were better than this.I liked the books but this was not good. HopefullyPrince Caspian is better when it comes out in 2007.But Adamson is still directing. Well maybe they'llget The Dawn Treader right."
1,Walt Disney Dropped The Ball on This One...,"Walt Disney did I wonderful job of the Pirates of the Carribean series when it was brought to Blu-Ray. They were released as a 2-Disc Special Edition with pretty worth-wild pakaging and features. However, with the The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe on Blu-Ray, it just didn't happen. Why would you shell out good money for something like this when the 4-Disc extended edition on DVD has so much more to offer. Granted you have the superior image and sound quality, but I would expect at least a 2-Disc edition with features of the 4-Disc DVD.It releases like this that make me question if the Blu-Ray version has anything to offer for the money. Shame on you Walt Disney!"
1,"Poor Acting, Boring Movie, Pretentious, Poor Adaptation","My headline says it all. This movie has none of the mystery and darkness of the book. It's all pretentious American kids pretending they are British, acting in a Disney story which resembles C.S. Lewis' story only in the literal sense. It has no spirit. No soul.It's just a bland Disney movie where everything is too perfect. The acting is just awful!! This is a poor substitute for Harry Potter let alone Lord of the Rings.The earlier 1988 BBC made-for-TV version of this movie has the coldness and menace that this story deserves. This 2005 ""film"" on the other hand, is so sappy that I just wanted to barf. Even a 10-year old is too mature for this ""simplified"" Disney version of the classic story. Get the BBC version at any cost!! This movie needs a soul. The BBC version (with real British people, no less) is the one to get. Unfortunately, it is not released on DVD and is quite hard to find."
5,Great kids movie!!!,My daughter is 4 years old and absolutely loved this movie!! She still watches it over and over again. The effects and the action really keep her interested.
1,The pirate version is called Narrrrrnia,"Wow - what a load of carp. This movie is laughable. I mean, maybe it's cool if you're a little kid, but as an adult it's pretty hard to take a talking beaver seriously. Of course it's a fantasy film so you're supposed to put those things behind you, but when the CGI effects are this awful you can't keep from groaning every time some ridiculous looking animal starts speaking with a British accent. The film is also plagued by horrible acting all around - it's really just a terrible film in every way. Long, slow and boring with a bad Braveheart battlescene rip-off ending. If you want to see talking animals, take mushrooms and go to the zoo."
1,Terrible Disney stuff,"This stuff was meant for children. Please do not watch this if you like the phantasy genre as this is like watching Lord of the Rings with only Hobit action. The four children from the cast do give things a try, but the lines that they are to pronounce are deeply annoying and very likely from another century. Especially the youngest girl truly got on my nerves! This is probably the clearest resemblence with Lord of the Rings as Frodo and Sam had lots of these tear jerking lines as well. The only violence you will get to watch in Narnia received a Disney treatment and the creatures Disney's studio came up with here are no fun at all. After half an hour I could not resist to use fast forward anymore. (SARR)"
3,Icy winter.,"The special effects were quite good in this film but the children were not especially appealing. The huge squishy lips the children had were distasteful. I wonder if they were computer enhanced and why? If they were any puffier, the children wouldnt have been able to talk. The faun was especially charming until he was turned into vinyl. The story didnt make much sense. I suppose it does to people who know the book. Of course the war scenes are ...as per usual... nasty. The ugly deformed animals are on the bad side which is the queen's side which is associated with winter. Oh my, why does the queen always have to be the bad guy and the king the good guy???? And why is the lion king called Asian? Is he a Chinese lion? His army has the more attractive animals. Someone said the lion is supposed to be Jesus Christ. I hope not. Lots of killing goes on which we are supposed to applaud."
1,Lame,"I am a huge fan of the books and had been very excited to see this film when it came out. Unfortunately, I was horribly disappointed.The acting was terrible, elements of the story were changed (I know, it can't be 100% true to the book, but this was a massacre), and the characters were ruined (c'mon, they made the movie version Mr. Tumnus seem just a tad bit...um...creepy). They turned Aslan into nothing more than a poorly animated talking lion.Seriously, go read the books and don't waste your time on this film."
1,Piracy,"When I received this DVD, I played it on my iMac. When doing this, I discovered that there were Chinese characters showing at the top of the screen. The quality of the DVD images were dark and grainy. I reported to Amazon that they had unknowlngly sold me a pirated DVD, and I was saddened to not have a response from Amazon other than refunding my costs. Copyright is not only a law to protect publishers; it also protects consumers from getting poor quality products. I feel that I can no longer depend on Amazon to provide my DVD orders."
5,An Ultra-Mega Classic!,"I absolutely LOVE this DVD! I'm not a huge fan of the book itself (it's satisfactory), but the movie itself is AWESOME!I just love Aslan and Tumnus (he's my all-time favorite character) and the Pevensie children (especially Lucy, I think I can relate to her the most). This movie is heartwarming, thrilling, chilling (no White Witch pun intended!), and, if you're sentimental, tear-jerking.If you haven't seen this movie yet, then you don't know what you're missing! Go out and buy it!Oh yeah, and just a suggestion: you might want to get the 2-disc edition, because that provides more extras than the original 1-disc edition."
3,"If you're looking for cool extras, you'll be disappointed!","The movie is good, but the ""special extras"" that are touted in this DVD version are seriously disappointing! If you're paying the big bucks, thinking it's going to be like the extras on the HARRY POTTER flicks or LORD OF THE RINGS, forget it!The kids' commentary is fun, but other than that, it's all cursory; an overview and nothing extensive about the computer graphics or makeup.A total bummer! A Disney rip-off! Shame on them!"
3,Americanized version,"This dramatization is different than the British Wonderworks version of 15 or so years ago.It is highly Americanized. There is quite a lot of classical US lower class behavior such as confrontive behavior, raised voices and sarcasm.It is more visual and less intellectual. There are fewer scenes that are drawn out in time. This requires them to eliminate much of the plot and character development."
3,Good but somewhat lacking,"I watched this movie with my family and we all enjoyed it. My wife had read the book and knew what it was about. I didn't really know anything about it previously. It was a good movie and I'm sure as a kid I would have loved it. I just think it was lacking in a few areas. I don't know if that's due to the movie or if it was from the book. It starts out way to slow. When they get to Narnia, it's been winter for 100 years and then it starts thawing for no apparent real reason. The Lion character was disappointing and didn't seem very special to me. These young boys suddenly become daring knights seemed hoky to me. The witch acted more like just a mean woman than a witch. The movie is worth watching and if you have kids it may be worth owning. But don't expect to much."
2,booring,"I first read the book when I was 7 and I thought it was so cool. But the movie was pretty mediocre. There's nothing original and the special effects were similar to lord of the ring. The storyline is essentially created to fool people to believe that great achievements come easy. As a matter of fact, the titles of kings and queens were just handed over to the kids for doing nothing. The newspaper said this movie had christian moral values embedded in it. I guess that value is women are the greatest evil (white witch) and the non-christians (note how the good guys wear christian armors and bad guys non-christians) are next."
5,Absolutely 100% wonderful,"I went in not expecting much, and was amazed with how good this movie is. The actors that played Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy were perfectly cast. The visuals were wonderful, and the animals and CGI and everything was great. You feel that Narnia is real and you're there as you watch. I am telling you, this is a wonderful movie, see it soon."
3,"i disliked, wife liked","i rated this a 3.my wife would have rated a 5, i would have rated a 1.she grew up reading these books and already had this premise in her mind of how it was supposed to look, feel, and unfold.i just thought the story was horrible, acting not so great, special effects putrid..BUT i am the kind of guy that loved Lord of the Rings.. so i can appreciate fantasy movies."
4,Sometimes you just need to watch a good Childrens movie,This of course was well written; C. S. Lewis is a gifted author. See his book in movie format was wonderful. Very Good ACTING
4,Good movie,"This is a good movie, a good adaption of the book for the most part. Of course, a couple things were changed, but really not too much. I actually kinda liked this better than the book! -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
1,A,"Slow! This is a great movie, unfortunately Amazon isn't a good way to access. Run Away! Buy it somewhere else."
3,"Good movie, but does not follow the book very well","My son has been wanting to see this movie for awhile, but told him he must read the book first. I have has the set since the early-80's and love it. While many of the characters, events, and places are the depicted as in the book, there are some glaring errors. For example, the White Witches house was not made of ice and Edmund never saw Tumnus. Also, there was no romp by Aslan at the Stone Table.The casting was great, but the adaptation not so great, so only 3 stars."
5,Beautiful.,"I loved this film, i was read Narnia as a child and i'm a 20 years old now. But i was back. I was back with old friends and i felt literally like a child again in that world of young fantasy were the real world literally rips away and your left in a place were anything is possible. This is just how i felt watching it. It was filmed so perfectly and acted and scripted just right that i lost myself in it and was no longer aware that i was in a cinema. My younger brother would tap my shoulder and ask me to pass the popcorn and i would turn back to the screen and get sucked back into the world. With no waiting time to get back into it.I didn't expect it to be this good. Or the director to do this well. But i was well wrong. And all the happier for it.Children will be amazed, adults will enjoy it and if you're a reader...WOW."
5,Great Movie,"I seen it. I will see it again. I'm buying the DVD when it becomes available.To the casual browser of these reviews: Beware of those with halfbaked chips on their shoulders who are going to go all out here nder a variety of ""identities"" in order to post negative 1-star ""reviews."" These people most likely have not even seen this movie. They just want to trash anything remotely Christian or God-centered that gets media attention."
5,what I think,"I thought this film was great. It had a few differences from the actual book but it was awesome all the same. I would recommend this film to children, teenagers, and adults!"
4,"""The True Meaning of Sacrifice.""","This is very much a child's film that parents should never have any fear of taking home to their family. It's not as grave, or complex, as The Lord of the Rings, and will appeal to both younger children as well as adolescents. At some level, they will all get something out of seeing it. The interplay between good and evil is timeless and as easy to comprehend as anything they might see on a Christmas special. Narnia is a most rewarding tale whose values children may hopefully internalize. Traits like duty, honor, loyalty, and sacrifice are ones of which our society is in great need, and C.S. Lewis identifies and expounds on them here in noble fashion. Perhaps, viewers will be stimulated by the beauty of the story and take a look at his excellent written works like Mere Christianity."
4,Narnia - the movie,"I found the movie version to be spectacular, wonderfully filmed, and the characters of Lucy and Edmund vey well played. Nothing can fault it technically as a film but I found that it didn't capture the essence of the book as C.S. Lewis wrote it. Back in the 1980's the BBC produced a television version of The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe, which does capture the book perfectly and is still available on DVD. My suggestion is that you first read the book then watch both productions on DVD and see if you agree with me."
4,NIV WOMEN'S DEVOTIONAL BIBLE,"Wrote my review of this above. Same problem. Not the cover I ordered, or thought I ordered. Don't like this cover as much as the original...LaVonne"
5,NIV,This is my favorite Bible - It is very easy to understand and I really like it. I read it all the time . Thank You!
5,Wonderful Addition to Women,"This Bible is wonderful. Not only does it have all the scriptures, but it has little devotionals for women to help us through some difficult times and times in general. It brings us closer to God and His words that we can take comfort in. I would highly recommend this Bible for Christian women out there."
2,NIV Womens Devotional Bible,I bought this bible due to the picture on the Amazon web site. My daughter asked for a pink bible. The bible which was sent had a different cover. The adverstising. The bible had a green/pink cover.
4,"I like it, but...","I received my new bible yesterday, and its in great shape except for some strange red tape across some of the pages. Did anyone else have this?"
5,MY BIBLE,IT MADE ME VERY HAPPY TO KNOW YOU CAN GET A USED BIBLE AND IT BE AS GOOD AS NEW I WILL USE THAM FOR ALL MY BOOKS I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE BIBLE AND HAVE TOLD ALL OF MY FAMILY AND FRAINDS TWO THANK YOU SO MUCH AND GOD BLESS
4,Very user friendly,Enjoy reading this Kindle version. Easy to read and use. Nice to always have my devotional with me in addition to other books I am reading.
4,NIV Women's Devotional Bible,I like the NIV Bible. It is easy to read and understand. The devotional readings add additional understanding to the passages and the reflection questions are very thought provoking.
2,kindle version difficult to navigate,"I am looking for a daily Bible for my kindle and this sounded perfect. I downloaded the sample to see if I liked the devotions. However when I opened the sample I had a hard time just finding the first day. If you go into the menu and hit beginning it does take you to the title page, after that is a table of contents, which has one or more pages for each chapter of the bible. Eventually I just picked Genesis and bungled into the daily readings. I like that it has the entire Bible in order, so I could just read through the Bible, if I want to. However, it is just too hard for me to move from place to place. The print version may be great, but the kindle version did not work for me."
5,Need Audio,"My mother loves this book, the ease in reading and understanding. She is a diabetic and can no longer see the fine print. Will there be in the future a large print or audio cassette of this book? I would love to surprise her with this as a gift."
2,DESIRE FANTASYBELLYDANCE,"i GAVE IT A 1 STAR, BECAUSE THE DVD WAS GLICHY, IT FROZE, IMPOSIBLE TO PLAY! PROBABLY THE INSTRUCTORS DESERVE A LOT BETTER RATTING. SORRY ABOUT THAT, BUT I COULD'T WATCH EVEN 20 MINUTES. I ONLY SAW BROKEN IMAGES. BAD QUALITY PRODUCED DVD."
5,"Helpful, Complimentary Guide","Our family used this guide with the DVD. We read the Bible verses suggested in the guide, then watched the DVD lesson, and then went through the questions in the guide. It was a very helpful addition to the DVD lesson, and brought even greater meaning to this wonderful DVD Bible study series."
2,Not exactly,This item was advertized as not new but had mroe writing in it that rendered it not usable for the purpose for which I had purchased it. The material presented in it is great and useful but this book could not be used by a student as intended.
2,"Get the ""Best Of"" album and forget this one.","This album was very disappointing. It consists of 3 cuts of about 6 minutes -- 2 of which are on the ""best of"" album -- followed by 46 minutes (count 'em! Forty six minutes!) of contemplative piano plunking."
1,A waste of time.,"The only good bits of this album are on 'Images', so get that instead. This album has far too few tracks. Who is going to want to listen to a track nearly 50 minutes long which is just noise?"
2,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,Absolutely no comparison to Eno. The 45 minute ambient piece is simply boring.
5,Must have CD for any Jarre fan,"Jean Michel Jarre's efforts are once again incredible on this album. For reviewers who do not understand the point of this album, please read on. This album is dedicated to Jacques Cousteau. Calypsos 1, 2, and 3 are named after his seacrafts. And since he spent a lot of time deep under the ocean, Waiting for Cousteau is 46:53 long. That's why the track is so long genius! And no, the three Calypsos are not cheesy. They are three of the finest pieces of music Jarre has composed in the 1990s. Just because he uses calypso-type rhythms does not make the music cheesy. Listen to the music and judge for yourself."
5,As far as I can see,"I bought Ready for Algebra because we're homeschooling and I have trouble with math. I'm an older-than-usual mom and it's been 40 years since I had algebra, so I need help. Frankly, I got this book for myself. The cartoons, the simple explanations, and the blessings of an index and glossary are helping pave the way for me as I work alongside my daughter in math. Now I'll understand what she's asking and not have to call our mentor math mom all the time. :)"
1,Dr. Math's Gets you Ready for Algebra,"I was really looking forward to getting what seemed and read like a really good Pre-Algebra book made easy; however, what this book lacks most is actual math problems, work and/or exercises. Its filled with mostly words and what looks like good instructions, but when I was prepared to give and assign exercises for my girl, I couldn't find any! Don't get it, unless you want to waste your money. Hope this helps."
2,Lacks detail,"I thought the examples throughout the chapters and follow-up exercises were good. However, the author's explanations leave much to be desired. I'm very experienced at object oriented programming languages, yet there are passages within this book that make little sense to me. Basically, I felt as if the author sacrificed completeness for brevity. This is pretty much what other reviewers have said. I wish I would have heeded their warnings prior to buying this book. My advice is to pass on this book for something better."
3,OK...,"While this book is very detailed and has a lot of information in it about Cocoa programming, it starts off too quickly. You might be discouraged by the assumptions the author makes about how much C (and programming in general) you know. If you are experienced in computer programming, then you will find this book to be a blast and will learn objective -C in no time at all. However, if you aren't too good with programming, start off with some online tutorials or other books, as you will get lost after reading the first two chapters or so."
4,A significant improvement!,"After reading the first edition, I wasn't at all interested in buying the second edition until I read a review that indicated that the second edition wasn't just an updated rehash of the first. Indeed, this book is completely different. Where the first book was little more than Apple's online examples in print, this book incorporates step-by-step examples of simple applications that are used to demonstrate numerous Cocoa programming topics. I got almost nothing out of the first book. I am actually feeling somewhat confident and I am making progress on a couple of projects with the knowledge I have gained from this edition."
3,"A good book, but not the best book","A very popular book, and greatly improved in its second edition. Very example and tutorial oriented; somewhat out of date at this point, however. Helps the user learn Interface Builder, ProjectBuilder and Objective-C, too. Possibly a bit shallow to get the reader writing their own Cocoa programs from scratch, but a good introduction. Ultimately, probably not as recommended for a first purchase as Cocoa Programming by Scott Anguish or Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X by Aaron Hillegass."
3,"Good try, but needs a bit more work","This book needed one more pass by the proofreaders. There are an annoyingly large number of typographical errors and other mistakes. What surprised me is that after introducing a number of features of Interface Builder, the author tends to manually write code (e.g., outlet declarations) then load the results into Interface Builder to make the various object connections. It would have been better in my view to simply use Interface Builder to perform these tasks (certainly less error prone).Overall, the book is helpful in explaining a lot of issues, but I would have like the book to touch more in internationalization issues, such as how to handle input method editors and product localization. In real world programing, I'll need internationalization and input method editor handling before I need to worry about speech synthesis."
2,One of McCartneys worst albums,"Paul McCartney has released more than a few lacklustre albums in his long career and this has to be one of the worst. There's one great track (""Only Love Remains"") and a couple of catchy numbers (""Press"" and ""Angry"") but most of the songs here are instantly forgettable. It's obvious that Paul was experimenting with a few of the tracks but they mostly come off sounding embarrassing. ""However Absurd"" seems to be Paul trying for a Lennon stream-of-consciousness ""I Am The Walrus"" vibe, but it just makes me cringe. The majority of tracks here are boring, barely tuneful filler.Avoid this effort and spend your money on CDs like ""Flowers In The Dirt"" and ""Flaming Pie"". Sure, they also have some pretty average filler between the better tracks, but are far more enjoyable and satisfying than this weak effort."
4,I always loved this album,"I have read mixed reviews on this album for many years. It's unusual that i would like this album so much among so many other beatles fans that seem to feel Paul was luke warm on this effort. When i first bought the cassette tape in 1986 it did not have the extra tracks on it. And I still loved it. For those that are unsure of whether or not to purchase this CD, i think the bonus tracks should seal the deal for these individuals. Especially ""Once upon a Long ago."" What a beautiful song.Now this CD is no ""Band on the Run."" But i think i like it alittle better than ""Flowers in the Dirt"" and ""Tug of War."" Great songs are ""Stranglehold,"" ""Good times coming/Feel the sun,"" ""Angry,"" ""Footprints."" I don't care for ""Pretty Little Head,"" or ""move over Busker."" ,I have been a Beatles and Mccartney fan since 1983 or so. And I think this album deserves a listen from any fan."
2,Could have been worse I suppose.,"When this album came out, and I remember that Rolling Stone gave it some crazy number of stars and said Paul was back. finally. I was so happy, I guess it had seemed all along like there were just enough signs of life -- a bass line here, a charming song there, that famous and little-changing voice -- that Paul really had the potential to pull himself together and do something good. And I rushed out and bought it.Unfortunately, Paul was not back. This is yet another disappointing Paul album. He is making an effort not to be quite as treacly as elsewhere (there's even a song called ""I'm angry"" that attempts to show some edge.) But it has that ineffable pall of laziness and insincerity that keeps it from being actually good, listenable music. Anyway, I keep pulling it out every few years, hoping that somehow it will have aquired a pleasant patina. But no. I always return it to the shelf, freshly disheartened."
3,A Lost Gem!!!!!,"Actually this is not a Bad album for McCartney not his best but this is what you get when Paul writes song with Eric Stewart former member of the Mindbenders and 10cc very strange Karma!!!! My favorite songs are the first track StrangleholdPress to Play , Only Love Remains which is a great Ballad and Pretty Little Head ( The Video is Awesome) plus Bonus tracks Spies Like Us & Once Upon A Long Ago !!! Overall a good album that gets overlooked!!!"
3,Press To Play,"This cd released in 1986 brought Mccartney out of the gutter he'd been in since 1983. Give My Regards To Broadstreet being is lowest point to date. A cd with some good tracks, a couple outstanding like, (Good Times), and (Stranglehold), and the usual Macca b-sides that should've been left off! Great Album package, should be enjoyed by most Macca fans. Keith Downey"
1,"""I wonder how that goes""","This is one of Paul's worst efforts. Having all of his work, I read the tracklist and can't remember what's the tune for each one (except maybe the chorus of ""Talk more talk""). I write this review in order to ""promote"" the fact that Paul said he has the same impression with this cd, claiming he didn't know what he was on and wondering ""how this goes"" as he reads the tracklists. For fans only, and what a pity, considering this album took about two years to make -one of Paul's greatest efforts-, and Linda McCartney is in the cover. For Paul's best 80s music -'Press to play' is from 1986-, check his 'Flowers in the dirt' (with the extra tracks) and 'Tug of war'. The 1980 album 'McCartney II' is mostly made of demos Paul wasn't even aiming to release in the first place, so it's a take-it-or-leave-it offering."
2,Press To Play (1986),"This is by far the worst album of Pauls solo career. BY FAR. This would even dis- appoint die- hard, hardcore fans. This is just a bunch of poorly written, un- inspired songs and it shows very badly when listening. There are two good songs and thats just good, on this album. Those are ""Press"", ""Only Love Remains"" and ""Tough on a Tightrope"". On these songs you just want them to end when your listening to them because there so long and boring. This never should have been released. I hate to say it but its that bad. You really dont know how bad it is until you listen to the whole thing. Maybe someone likes it, I dont know. But I sure dont. Iam a huge fan of his and this just doesnt cut it from such a brilliant musician. If you want good Paul albums from the 1980's get ""McCartney II"" (1980), ""Tug Of War"" (1982)or maybe ""Flowers in the Dirt"" (1989)."
3,However absurd!,"This album isn't as bad as some people claim. The reason they slag it off is down to its 1980s sound and flavour - but you can't expect Paul to carry on making 70s style music in the 80s can you? You've got to at least try and keep up with the times and Paul has always had the courage to tread new ground.There are a few clangers on the record though - especially ""Talk more talk"", ""Pretty little head"" and ""Write away"". Even ""Good times coming"" is dodgy - although the ""Feel the sun"" section is better. The good songs are ""Stranglehold"", ""Footprints"", ""Only love remains"", ""Press"" (VERY catchy), ""Move over busker"" (a good mccartney rocker) and ""Spies like us"" (bonus track). Those songs alone make this a 3 star effort. Don't expect too much - but I enjoy listening to it."
3,only for a die hard macca fan,"In my house when any Beatle releases a album it's a holiday...So! This was during the eighties when McCartney was exploring new musical venues and just got caught up in the techno computer drummed repetitive noise. Critics hated it, the public did not fare much better. Me? Like any Macca albums there are moments and then again the entire album drifts down to feeling empty in the end. Lyrics like ""Breaking eggs in a dish"" on However Absurd to ""Outside was a space ship, it flew away"" on Talk more talk. Then there is the horrible ""Angry"" that has a bunch of musicians including Pete Townsend where I was ready for a really good rocker and it was just noise. BUT! ""Press"", ""only love remains"" hold up well and the bonus track ""Once upon a long ago"" is excellent. If I ever meet McCartney in person (and I'd love to!!!!) I will ask him for my money back on this one."
2,Lackluster album,"Press To Play is the low point of Paul McCartney's career. Alot of the criticism lobbied at Mr. McCartney is that he doesn't make music like he made with the Beatles. That is unfair as no one could match those songs and alot of his solo work is high level stuff. The problem with Press To Play is that it's not good by anyone's standards. The songs like Footprints"", ""Pretty Little Head"", ""angry"" and ""Tough On A Tightrope"" are mostly throwaways. The album doesn't offer much expect the songs ""Stranglehold"" and ""Press"" which are very good songs. ""Spies Like Us"" is a bonus track and was the theme to the Chevy Chase-Dan Ackroyd film of the same name. It's a fun song and went to number 7 in 1985. Shockingly that is, to date, his last top ten song."
2,"""Press to Eject""","One of Paul McCartney's worst albums, ""Press to Play"" (1986) does not contain a noteworthy track. The uninspired singles ""Press"" and ""Stranglehold"" fizzle - along with everything else. An utterly dispensable effort from Sir Paul. The 1993 reissue gains a star for the welcome inclusion of ""Spies Like Us"" (1985) and the extended ""Once Upon a Long Ago"" (1987)."

3,"Worth it for ""Spies Like Us""","I don't own this album and haven't heard it since college when my freshman roommate (a huge McCartney fan) brought it back to the dorms. Think I listened to it once and was only marginally interested in the songs ""Press"" and ""Stranglehold"" (my roommate was even less im-""pressed""). The rest was typical 80's synth pop that Paul was so hit and miss with throughout the decade. Still, if you're a fan of the song ""Spies Like Us"" (a fun throwaway song and Macca's last US Top Ten hit), it is included here as a bonus track. It is thus far the only place you can find the song on CD."
5,This CD,I was very happy with the quickness and quality in which this was received. Thank you again.
1,MUCH BETTER THAN I FIRST THOUGHT,"i must admit that i slightly misjudged that album, it's actualy quite good, although a bit of annoying 80's beatbox but that's half the charm of it in fact. ""good times comin'/feel the sun"" is an excellent song, ""only love remains"" can probably take a tear from my eyes, ""press"" is a good poppy song and ""once upon a long ago"" has always been one of my favorites.plus i love the cover and the bonus tracks are fine."
2,merely mediocre,"As McCartney records go, this isn't too bad, merely mediocre. I mean, if you want AWFUL, listen to ""Band on the Run"" or ""Venus and Mars"" or pretty much any Wings recording."
3,Press To Play,"One of the unfortunately forgotten McCartney albums. Some clinkers on it, but also several gems like ""Press To Play"" , ""However Absurd"", and the highly underated ""Only Love Remains"". ""Move Over Busker"" is a rouser. ""Once Upon A Long Ago"" is another forgotten, underated masterpiece. Not his best, but his average albums are better than most albums out there. This album is worth the money if you can get it below retail."
3,hhhmmmm...,"This is a definite mixed bag of an album and one of Macca's most obscure I guess. A lot of the songs here were written with Eric Stewart of 10cc, not one of the most inspired partnerships.There are good songs here : 'Only Love Remains' is a typically soaring ballad which would've suited an ""earthier"" production. 'Footprints' is a nice little song I think. Some pleasant rockers like 'Stranglehold' and 'Move Over Busker' and the title track make this one worth a listen. The production sounds very dated here with the synths and effects swamping some of the tracks...but you never know this kind of thing may come back into vogue and people will perhaps look at this album with a new perspective. Not a bad album by any means but I was glad when Elvis Costello came on the scene after this one and made the next album a far better effort. Beautiful shot of Paul and Linda on the cover of this CD by the way!"
3,"Worth it for ""Spies Like Us""...","I don't own this album and haven't heard it since college when my freshman roommate (a huge McCartney fan) brought it back to the dorms. Think I listened to it once and was only marginally interested in the songs ""Press"" and ""Stranglehold"" (my roommate was even less im-""pressed""). The rest was typical 80's synth pop that Paul was so hit and miss with throughout the decade. Still, if you're a fan of the song ""Spies Like Us"" (a fun throwaway song and Macca's last US Top Ten hit), it is included here as a bonus track. It is thus far the only place you can find the song on CD."
5,Acoustic equivalent of gentle waves on a beach on a moonlit night,"""Oxygene"" (1977) is one of the most ethereal and relaxing albums ever. Whenever I hear it I imagine I am an air bubble floating gently from the deep ocean to the surface."
5,"Oxygene, the origin of electronic music.","I received my first copy of Oxygene on a cassette tape in 1981 at the age of 11. It was like nothing else out there, and I loved it. It influenced my choice of music from that moment on. Today I still listen to electronic music, Dance, House and Trance our my favorites. I bought this copy, not only because it was on CD, but because I heard one of the top DJ's in the world use one of the tracks during a recent set................It never gets old. Get it, Enjoy it."
4,"Best from Jarre, but not the best recording...","If I am limited to buying only one CD from Jean Michel Jarre, this CD would be it. The music is very complex and yet easy to listen to. It was one of the best analog recording around at the time. On a digital medium, i.e. CD, its sound quality suffers when compared to newer recordings.This CD is a must for New Age fan."
3,A TRUE GENIUS,I had this 4 years ago and bought it for the 2nd track basically. A few of the others impressed me but do listen to it now and again. Images is one of my favourites but in my view this album is worth buying just for Oxygene 2
4,Views of a composer,"Ok guys , for you who don't know much about electronic music ,JM Jarre's first success was the theme music he wrote for the 1974 World Cup .It was nothing very unusual because in 1972 a British electronic music band named Popcorn wrote the theme song for the 1972 Munich Olympics.Again in the same time period Pink Floyd made their album Dark side of the moon , which used mooog synthesizers heavily and for the German dudes such as Kraftwerk and Tangerine dreams , man they don't have no melodies!..I have some Cd's from a band called Aphrodite's child in which Vangelis was a keybord player and in their late 60's recordings they were using sythesizers ..."
5,Oxygene,One of the most animated of the genre. Jean-Michel Jarre is really a genius. Not to be missed.
5,as it always should have been,"Nothing much to say. This is the sound We have been waiting for, for the best electronic music album ever."
5,Outstanding,Penny Clark Babson is a hot up and comming writter and you must purchase this must read book. I caint wait to read her next novel as this one was just that good!
4,Danzig sounds amazing live!,"The audio songs are good on this cd but its the live tracks that really make it excellant! All four live tracks are incredible and make u feel like you're there! ""Sistinas"" is the best track on this cd in my eyes."
4,Solid Enough EP From Danzig,"For an EP with random studio tracks and a few live songs, it's pretty good. Danzig's voice, naturally, is the highlight. In '93, when this came out, it was at its strongest. The original studio tracks, ""It's Coming Down"" and ""The Violet Fire,"" are fine Danzig songs that would have sounded good on the second or third album. The Elvis cover, ""Trouble,"" is a fun few minutes, and Danzig has always been dogged by the ""Evil Elvis"" moniker. Good to see he doesn't shy away from it.On the live tracks Glenn's vocals sound like Danzig III. They're more harsh than on I and II, not as much of a clean, cool delivery. The band sounds like they do on the albums, except maybe a little louder, as Glenn's vocals on the early albums were way up front in the mix. While I do have better EP's, this is worth having for Danzig fans. And, as I paid a quarter for it (as in 25 cents, plus shipping), I feel like I got my money's worth."
4,The Live Tracks are This Album,"Thrall, the studio tracks section, is nothing special- the songs get worse with each track. I'm Coming Down is very good, Violet Fire is pretty good but could be better, and Trouble is mediocre. But then there's Demonsweatlive- a collection of prime cuts from previous albums in live glory. This is very good overall because of the live tracks, but they should've just done a whole live album. Oh, and nice EP that's priced the same as all his other full-lengths except the debut."
2,Mother 93',"dumb front imagery, good music, 3 new songs, and sistinas live along with Mother(Mother 93')"
4,Solid EP from the godfather of ghoul rock,"This EP, featuring three studio cuts (two originals and one cover), and four live cuts recorded on Halloween night. ""It's Coming Down is a plain 'ol awesome track in the classic Danzig fashion, while ""Violent Fire"" and ""Trouble"" are solid cuts as well. The live versions of ""Snakes of Christ"", ""Am I Demon?"", ""Sistinas"", and, of course, ""Mother"", show Glenn and crew at their best, and the sound quality is great; something that the later released ""Live on the Black Hand Side"" severely lacked. All in all, Danzig loyalists probably already own this, and with the cheap price ""Thrall"" is worth every penny."
4,"Good cookies, but see my review","These are good cookies, and worth the four stars, IF one rates the cookies one can get from the mall and/or order directly from Mrs. Field's website directly to be 5 stars. These are soft as an aside. I would disagree though and not rate them ""YUCK"" as one reviewer has done here. I can tell that the grade of white chocolate isn't quite the same as the cookies sold from their website for instance. So, much better then ""YUCK"", I'm not disappointed at all but next time I want a box of their cookies I'll probably order from Mrs. Field's direct."
3,A nice children's story,"This is a short picture about an elderly couple who find a fountain of youth. It is accompanied by sign language illustrations of the story. These are in pidgin signed English (American Sign Language signs in English word order). It is a fun way for children to learn some ASL vocabulary, but it is not ""Sign Language Literature"" i.e., it does not represent any kind of traditional story from the Deaf community or even an ASL translation of the Korean folk story."
4,"Beautiful book, but has a catalog feel.","This book is a good source for orchid lovers. The photos are beautiful, but I couldn't help feel as if I were previewing a fancy catalog. Why were these orchids picked to be in this book? I was disappointed that the plants listed were not of the more readily available variety. I had the book with me when I went into Smith and Hawken and the odd thing was some of the plants they had for sale were not listed in the book. So I guess it's not a catalog after all. A great thing about the book is that it offers information on the plant shown so the reader would have an idea what plant would bloom in what size pot. It also gives you good info on how to care for a specific plant so you don't make the mistake of buying one that would be too difficult to care for."
4,Great Photography!!,"I have found this book to be helpful in finding information regarding a specific orchid. I'm the Orchids host at BellaOnline.com and need to be able to research and become familiar with a variety of orchids. This book devotes 2 pages to each of the 100 orchids featured--one page to the growing requirements and the other to a full page color photo of the plant in bloom.You may not be able to find the exact plant pictured, but the information included will give you a good start on finding an orchid with similar needs. If you are looking for a profile of Oncidium ""Sharry Baby"", you can find one here--with a nice photograph.The first section of the book contains general information on culture, buying orchids and various locations to house your collection."
2,"not really ""dominoes""","The description says ""extra thick dominoes""... yeah, extra thick CARDBOARD. I was very disappointed. Basically, they are printed on cardboard and you pop them out of a sheet. Brilliant. Don't buy these if your kid still has sticky fingers or tends to taste things. My three year old niece liked the pictures but, having played with real dominoes, knew that these were nothing special. I intended this to be a special gift and it is really more of a stocking stuffer. Very sneaky the way they don't tell you the material, beware!!!"
3,Disney Princess dominoes,"As a speech pathologist , parent , grandparent, caregiver or babysitter this toys is a great toy for improving speech, language or as a conversation starter. It might also come in handy at a sleepover for younger girls or as a party game . Its fun, easy and durable."
1,"Bass distorts every song, just started.","I really do love the sound bag. What a great idea, and I use it alot, that is until about a week ago. It started distorting all the songs. Even when I had the volumne of my MP3 on 1, it still distorted the song. I did email Cluthfield, but never heard anything back. What can I do to remedy this? I feel that it should have lasted longer for the money. And, no, it was never dropped. I keep it clipped to the side of my purse.Please, advise me what to do. I do want the bag, but I think I should receive a new one.Thank you, Debbie Kelly750 Washington AvenueNiles, Ohio 44446Let me know how to return this for another.Thank you."
3,Clear Instructions for Beginner/Intermediate Projects,"This book gives clear instructions on how to make Beginner to Intermediate projects. There are plenty of good photos showing each stage of making a project. The reason I didn't give a high rating for the book is that the projects are not meticulously finished (you can see tool marks on some finished projects, for example). There are some really cute ideas. I recommend the book for Beginners or people looking for some inspiration."
2,think twice before buying,Even with my several years of experience wrapping wire I found the instructions incomplete and confusing. Definitely not a book for a novice but possibly a good reference book. Beautifully illustrated though. I got some great ideas for displaying my jewelry.
3,sale is a scam,"When you put something ""on sale"" then charge enough shipping so that the sale item is actually more than the other colors which are offered with free shipping it makes me seriously question the integrity of your company. The heather gray is listed as on sale for 4.19 with 5.92 shipping while the large navy is 7.91 with free shipping."
2,Not the greatest...,"I got a white, straight cotton version of this tank (no polyblend). The shirt didn't have loads of reviews, but I took a shot at getting one. The cotton is cheap and nasty feeling. Abrasive like paper towel or something, washing didn't make it any better. I will be tossing it aside for extra. I tried wearing it as an undershirt, by the time the day was over I was itching (literally) to get it off ASAP. For $8 per I feel it should have been a little better quality, I will keep shopping around."
2,Try Champion instead,"Pros- Very cheap - as in affordableCons- Shrinks much more than the equivalent product by Champion.- Bottom of shirt curls upwards, very annoying.- Does not last long- holes start forming in about a year.- Cotton is also courser than Champion."
4,nice,"I bought this tank top by mistake almost 2 years ago, and it was a tottally great mistake i like this one a lotits good material, it aint loosing no color, or getting bigger at allgreat buy by mistake"
3,Standard under shirt,"I see nothing spectacular about this shirt. Just a regular old under shirt. Certainly doesn't meet expectations of other reviewers. It's a good shirt, but not sure it's worth the price."
2,Never Really Works,"Subtitled ""A Novel of Magical Noir Suspense,"" the book has stylish aspirations beyond its ability to produce. The plot all revolves around a magical Japanese talisman, and the powers that can be channeled through it. A drifter with the heavy-handed nickname ""Mage"" unwittingly stumbles into its possession, and from there its a pretty typical story of his trying to find out why the woman who gave it to him was killed, and why he is being chased around. The supernatural element comes from various creepy disembodied undead and monsters from Japanese mythology who are employed by the villains. Fortunately, Mage picks up an ethnic Tontoesque sidekick to defend him and help him understand all these mysterious happenings. There are some good fight scenes, but the whole thing is a rather forced, and the portrayal of the Japanese boss behind it all is very cliché."
2,"Nice concept, but shallow","I very much liked the concept, but it was a light -- as in lightweight -- read. It's not really noir: The good guys are nearly spotless, the bad guys black as pitch, and the villian much too easily out-smarted and defeated -- like a bad Bond flick. I could have done without the snide jabs at Reagan. Big turn-off. Also, both the author and the editor missed this fact of human physilogy: pupils contract, not dialate, when lights are shined in them (pg. 262.) Luckily for him, the woman Mage shot was, in fact, a monster. Wait for the true paperback -- the trade paperback wasn't worth the price."
4,"A great book, I'd buy fifty more just like it!","My taste is clearly not the same as your average Amazon.com reviewer's, because I loved this book. What did I like about it? For me, the big selling point was the characters. These are cool people. Magistrale and Takumo are people I enjoyed hanging out with in my head. Plus, I think that Dedman really has a light (and I mean light, not ""shallow,"") touch with dialogue, which made this novel a blast to read.Maybe I'm just a sucker for a rip-roaring tale of adventure and magic. If you are, too, you'll love this book."
5,"Gritty, first rate work from an author who is new to me","Never heard of Dedman before but I fancied his title and the book turned out to be really well done. Very gritty urban fantasy, like maybe Charles de Lint might write if he was really angry. Well done. I will buy more of Dedman as it appears."
4,Australian SF Reader,"If you want a slightly more recent referent to this character, perhaps consider him a cross between Harry Dresden and John Ross, the Knight of the World.When a girl that is more broke than he is asks Mage for help, he gets involved with the yakuza, Japanese monsters and wizards, and becomes a magic man."
3,an enjoyable read for fans of the genre,"If you like urban fantasy, you'll enjoy this fun book. However,I wouldn't put it in the same class as my favorite Tim Power's books.I didn't find it particularly angry. I enjoyed the japanese mythology and will keep an eye out for future efforts by Dedman, but only 3 stars from me."
3,Good book for WAP introduction,"I consider this book to be the best for giving introduction about all the aspects of WAP. I guess the title ""Professional"" misled the people. This book is very nicely laid out and contents are good. (The)... examples are not all that great in some of the chapters. For instance examples in Java, ASP, JSP areas are great but in the push/pull technology chapters, there are no examples at all.Still this gave me very good insight of WAP and helped me to finish my first project on WAP.I would definitely recommend this to any beginner to WAP. For others, this is not the book."
5,great book...,this was one of the first complete WAP books. The book covers all the begining and advanced topics. I recommend this book to someone with good previous knowledge of web development.
5,An excellent read!,"This book is excellent. It starts out with the people involved and leads up to the creation and demise of the greatest house I've ever seen. Yes, I was fortunate enough to grow up in the area of this exquisite palace. Unfortunately, I did not walk the halls of Whitemarsh in its heyday, but even in its dilapidated state, it was an awesome sight to see, beyond that which words can describe. The book is a good read and well worth the selling price. What happened to this house is nothing short of a crime."
4,Whitemarsh Hall,"This is an excellent, albeit brief, account of the life and times of Ned and Eva Stotesbury and the magnificent gilded-age estate they built near Philadelphia in the early twentieth century. The book includes contemporary photos and first hand accounts of the construction and use of the property. The estate's design and execution decision logic with architect Horace Trumbauer was explored in depth. Also included is the post-Stotesbury use and the regrettable loss of this significant property."
1,WOW! This is bad.....,"This is the worst movie I have seen in a while. Dolph Lundgreen is old but it doesnt't really look that bad. He is moving and speaking in slow motion but manages to kill everybody. The script is really bad and the acting unconvincing. If you must see it, do yourself a favor and rent it. It is not worth the disc is recorded on.What is it with old ""stars"" and young girls in these movies anyway ? I find it lame and disgraceful.... The girl could definetely be his daughter.The bluray transfer however, is not bad..."
5,Even better than the DVD,I didn't think the DVD could get any better until I saw the Blu-ray. The action feels like it's in your living room. Hi-def Dolph. Done and done.
5,IS GREAT!!!,"Despite what the other reviews say below, I love the movie and the actress Gina May is cute too! People, this is an action movie 80s style, I guess some people didnt get the concept. Tell you what, Im glad Dolph is still acting. I had no idea what happened to him until I saw this movie on cable!!!!If you like 80s style action movies youll love this!!!RAY GAYO 007"
5,A Perfect Antidote,"This book is the perfect antidote for a mind that is caught up in its own world, ignorant of the possibilities that lie beyond its confines. The delightful stories bring to light those antics of the mind that distort vision. Once these inadequate mentations are exposed, the process of thinking becomes clearer and less muddled with speculation and confusion. I think any one who is interested in discovering within oneself the method for sifting fact from fiction will find these stories invaluable. In addition, the reader, freed from the strictures that bind ordinary thought, gets a glimpse of a greater world with greater freedom and greater potential."
4,The wisecracking Sufi makes for fun thought provoking reading.,"I very much enjoyed this book and its illustrations. I could have done without some of the modern input. The Mullah Nasrudin lived many centuries ago and is credited with a collection of humorous stories about the mundane aspects of life. These stories could be compared somewhat to the Zen koans, only I found them more enjoyable. My favorite Nasrudin stories, however, are those that were told to me. This book is also available in Spanish as Las ocurrencias del incredible mula Nasrudin."
5,A blast of a read!,"The trend during the last few years towards stories about stupid people brought us such non-classics (but entertaining reads) as ""The 776 Stupidest Things Ever Said"", ""The Darwin Awards"", and others. But what few people know is that such stories were circulating 1000 years ago in the Sufi storytelling tradition.These stories are the equivalent of our ""Urban Legends"". Oddly enough, as I read this, I wish that I could view the world in such simple ways as the Mulla Nasrudin, who is the character in all these stories. His views, often twisted, very often completely at odds with his surroundings, are also very pragmatic, and make perfect sense in his mind.These stories are tremendous fun, and rather thought-provoking.Enjoy!"
2,Poor translation.,"This book suffers from a very poor translation to English. I think it has a lot to do with the choices of words. Many times I found that if the author rephrased certain sentences then a joke and a moral would make much more sense. Also, some of the short stories contain illogically connected sentences thus really doing a trick on the meaning of a joke that author was trying to translate. All these is very sad because the stories of Nasrudin can be a real delight. I guess I will have to find a better book."
2,Not exactly Mulla Nasrudin,"This book is a compilation of funny anecdotes and jokes compiled through the ages. The choice of words and sentence structures clearly shows the difficulty in translating such text. In these regards the book is fine.This book fails mightily when talking about Mulla Nasuraddin. I understand that Mulla at this stage is mostly considered somewhat fictitious figures and stories about him probably have different origins which are attributed over the times to a single person. At the same time, the author has completely take a leap of faith and almost any anecdote even modern ones about trains and machines had been assigned to Mulla. I was really looking for the charm of those old time stories not a general anecdote. In that sense, this books disappointed me."
5,We Love Olivia,"My daughter loves her Olivia books, so she was very happy to get an Olivia doll for her birthday. She has tons of Gund stuffed animals, and they are all so cute, and so soft. This is a great toy for any little girl."
1,"$100 for a 10"" plush... seriously?","My daughter loves Olivia and I'm looking for some Olivia toys ... I see this 10"" plush for $99.99... seriously? No thank you - 1 star for horrible pricing."
3,Overpriced,"I ordered this toy and was disappointed when it arrived stained and in no plastic wrap. I believed I was buying a new toy, but it had obviously been used before. Fortunately, the company was very cooperative about refunding my money and did so immediately and also sent me a pre-paid return label. I felt the toy was overpriced given that other Olivia dolls were available at 1/5 of the price, and were just as cuddly."
1,Olivia,"Ordered Olivia and did not know for about a week that she was not in stock. Finally got a response to an e-mail from the company saying they had contacted my e-mail and refunded the money. Unfortunately I did not receive the e-mail until several days later but that is due to problems on my end. I checked with the bank and my check had gone thru so figured Olivia was enroute. After getting a reply from the co. I contacted the bank again and told them the situation. They said sometimes it takes up to a month to get the refund. I was most upset as it was a special present for one of my Grandchildren and I could have tried other places if I had only known she was not available. By the time I got around to that, she was unavailable everywhere. This was not a pleasant experience."
5,"Beautiful, complex, romantic and relaxing",Since I bought this a few months ago it has become one of my favorite CDs. The smoothness and sensuality are pure heaven. It will melt you.
1,Deception,"When I read about this amplifier and it's 2000w power I was expecting something powerful. When I did a standard stereo connection, I set the volume all the way up and It was just slightly louder than my 150w home stereo. Not at all what I was hoping for. Of course, if you do a bridge mono connection, with 2 cabinet speakers connected in series, It does get louder, but it still sounds more like 400w than 2000w. I think that the ""2000w"" claim is misleading, when you can only get about 200w in a regular stereo connection. More or less what you get with a consumer home stereo."
4,Quiet Storm balladry does not get smoother than this.,"Jean Carne recorded some truly mind-blowing, ever-beautiful Quiet Storm-flavored gems on this CD. ""No One Does It Better"", ""Make Love"", ""Falling For You"" and her remake of the standard ""Someone To Watch Over Me"" are all excellent reasons for buying this CD which (incredibly) got almost no radio airplay."
5,EXTRAORDINARY!!,THIS CD IS JUST ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE UNBELIEVABLE TALENT OF MS. JEAN CARNE .SHE IS SO UNDERESTIMATED AND DESERVES TO BE THE SUPERSTAR THAT SHE TRUELY IS!!!!!!!!!!
4,A Wonderful Album,"Any chance to hear Jean Carne sing is a wonderful oppertunity to listen to one of the music industry's most underated and under appreciated vocalists.I've been a fan of hers for more than 20 years and was not at all disappointed in this album.She sounds great, looks more beautiful than ever and chose some good songs.My only criticism would be that, although the last 3 songs are good, they seem a little out of place in respect to the rest of the album.This album was recorded in 1995.I only hope we'll have a new Jean Carne album soon."
4,Great stereo but not for a convertible,"I've had this stereo for almost a year now and I like everything about it except that I have it in a convertible and the display is totally unreadable when I put the top down. With the top up, it's fine no matter how bright it is outside."
4,Great Presentation,"My husband used this presentation cover for a resume package (12 sheets) presented before a hiring team at a job interview. The presentation cover is professional and is as described. The flip n clip secures readily and neatly, no matter how many times you open it to secure more sheets. The hiring team's comments were positive on the presentation. The resume stood out as professional. He did get the job.This product is packaged in a set of 6."
5,Great bag!,I love this bag. I presently use it for my netbook and plan to get a bigger one for everyday use. It is stylish and well made.
3,Too Much Valcro,"The bag is a bit boxy and has too much valcro, making it difficult to get in and out of it. The laptop portion is well padded. The mesh pocket is up-side-down so items place in it fall to the top of the bag instead of the bottom."
4,"Good book, but you can use less baking powder in the recipes","I enjoy the creative waffles that are in this book, especially the Apple-Gruyere waffles and the Polenta waffles.However, I have a hint for you: you can use no baking powder and just double the baking soda and that works fine for lift. I read in ""The Best Recipe"" that double-acting baking powder doesn't really work in waffles, because there isn't enough time in the short baking cycle for it to really get bubbling, and thus they use only baking soda in their recipes.I thought that Greenspan seemed to use an awful lot of baking powder in her recipes (one tablespoon? I don't even use that in regular baking!), so I modified it to use just a bit more baking soda and no baking powder in the Apple-Gruyere waffles, and it worked fine!"
4,Clever uses for a waffle iron,The author has gone to great lengths to make up waffle-able recipies. I really enjoy the carrot-raisin and the oatmeal banana waffles. They freeze wonderfully! Give a copy of this book with a waffle iron to newlyweds!
4,Relentless Sonic Attack,"The Hives are the best musical export out of Sweden since ABBA (sorry, Roxette). This mini-""best of"" album is a hotch-potch of 4 tracks from 2000's ""Veni Vidi Vicious"" album (which only this year gained acceptance in the US), with album tracks of 1997's ""Barely Legal"" CD and a variety of singles and B-sides.Clocking in at 28 min., ""Your Favorite New Band"" sums up very nicely where the Hives are at this point: take-no-prisoners, all out sonic assault, short songs that make rock so great, check out ""Hate To Say I Told You So"", ""a.k.a. IDIOT"", and ""Outsmarted"". The best song, though, is the delicious B-side ""The Hives Are Law You Are Crime"" (an instrumental no less) which puts us all in place!Please don't confuse the Hives with the Vines! The Hives are what rock is about (not that the Vines arent), and this compilation is a great introdution. Now when will they come out with a bona-fide follow-up to ""Veni Vidi Vicious""?"
4,Surprisingly Impressive,I received this mechanical pencil as gift. So far I've been very impressed with how comfortable it is and how well it writes. Best eraser I've used on a mechanical pencil as well.
1,Sent wrong DVD set twice,"I ordered this particular set of movies for my husband for Christmas. We had seen two of these movies and thought they are hilarious. The first order I received was the wrong 3 movies. I really wanted the older movies that are clearly specified on the order. I contacted Amazon and I returned the incorrect set. A few days later, I received another set and it was still the wrong 3 movies. I decided that they weren't going to get this right, so I just asked for a refund. I was very disappointed. You shouldn't offer a DVD set with specific movies and then send something entirely different."
2,poor drill work,This product was China made and the locking holes were not even close to center of shaft. Unable to install on trailer stand.
3,issues w/ design,"good solid item for my popup trailer, but the design has an issue. This is bolted onto the cross member of the trailer and you cant get it tight enough to begin rolling outward when used. the whole thing begins to turn when being cranked. I ""think"" a hole drilled in the side of it would make it not do that."
3,Dear Dear,"Decent CD, but poorly produced. Radio hits ""Nice to Luv You"" and ""She La"" are good/catchy (good music videos too) and I really dig Neil Osborne's voice. Their follow up (Smilin' Buddha Cabaret) is far superior, however."
5,All around great,"These bars taste great, they're filling and the portability is a plus! I will usually eat half a bar before a workout to keep me energized, and the other half after for recovery.Personally, I think the Chocolate bar has an off taste, while the Peanut Butter and Chocolate Mint ones are my favorites!"
1,"Great in theory, but inconsistent","The first package I received was great. Unfortunately, this last was not; the chocolate flakes all over the place as if it is old and/or melted and not kept in good conditions. I am certain that this could be fixed by Amazon, I just have not had the chance to make them aware of the problem yet.. And I'd rather not have had to."
1,Ridiculous,"It's absolutely ridiculous that they would sell this crap to people trying to get in shape.If you look at the nutrition facts, you see that for every 20g of protein you also get 20g of sugar!Don't take my word for it, do your research and find out why too much sugar is bad.There are MANY other brands out there that have a protein to sugar ratio of about 2:1 or even up to 3.5:1It is worth mentioning that the company is so deceitful that they actually HIDE the sugar content in nutrition facts (on the amazon product page)avoid this at all costs as this is not even that cheap to be a good deal."
2,Chocolate Clif Bar,I purchase and eat these Clif bars all the time. But ordering online may not be the best idea since they arrived damaged by heat during shipping. Its obvious the chocolate had melted in transit and flakes off as you eat them.
3,Good taste. Maybe a bit high on SUGAR 20g,"Choc Mint taste great, like the real thing. My only complaint is 20g sugar. Worldwide Pure Protein bars are only 2g sugar.Lots of crumbs can get a bit messy. A little dry can be hard to take down."
5,Tasty and Healthy,"An excellent tasting nutrition bar. I have tried many different Cliff bars, but this chocolate bar leads this class of a great product group."
3,Just Okay,The bar has the protein that I need but the taste is one to get use to. I was hoping for a bit more chocolate. But will have has filled my needs
3,Consistency of one shipment to another is hit/miss,"I have the subscribe and save option for this item. Some shipments are excellent in quality while others appeared to have melted in the past. I would saw the melted portion is small but can be significant.Otherwise for the price, I would recommend this as a good option given subscribe and save options."
2,Received the Bars Melted and Old,"I'm very disappointed in this vendor's quality of products. I ordered the Clif Builder Bars (which, by the way, can't be returned!)and received them having obviously melted in the warehouse. I always use a knife to cut them into bit size pieces so they are easy to eat at my desk. The pieces fell apart in chunks. To me, this means they not only melted but OLD.I do like the Clif Builder Mint Bars and will order from other vendors."
3,"Eh, not bad not too great...","I love Clif BUILDER's bars. Love mint, smores, and chocolate. Now I tried Vanilla Almond and it's not that great. It kind of has an alcohol-like taste in it. The crunchy part seems different from the other flavours I've tried and I think it's white chocolate coating instead of normal. Still chewy and crunchy. Not horrible- but I won't buy it again. Kinda glad I only got two."
5,Love the flavor!!,"This is one of the best protein bar flavors I've ever had. Just amazing, and I'm loving the ingredients too."
4,"Love these bars, but Amazon shipped stale ones!","I was psyched that I found these on Amazon, so I subscribed. Got my first shipment and found that these bars were stale! They looked and tasted like they were heated/cooled too many times - flavors and texture were all wrong, pretty much inedible.The bars themselves are usually great! Good texture, flavor and good for you. I often eat these as my lunch - they work well for me as a meal replacement."
2,"Taste like neither cookies, nor cream","I can't believe they call these cookies and cream. They don't taste like either cookies, nor cream! They taste vaguely like super dry granola though not as good. I ended up giving these away."
4,My Hubby Nabbed My Builder's Bars!,"I'm giving this a '4' because my husband likes them and took them from me to use after his weight lifting work-outs. But I tried one first: the outside chocolate was a bit crumbly probably due to shipping and storage. The taste was fair to real good for a high protein bar that doesn't use a lot of sugar alcohols to sweeten it, depending on your taste for such things. In other words it's not super-sweet but the sucralose (Splenda) gets the job done, if I remember correctly. It is SUPER for keeping you from getting hungry due to the fact that it has real carbs, not play carbs in it, to match it's high amount of protein - probably could be used for the Zone diet. You can last hours and hours on it. It's more than a meal. (This is NOT a dieter's bar, although with careful planning could be used as such.) We've tried a lot of bars and this is the best high protein bar yet that doesn't rely on sugar alcohols (otherwise, stick to South Beach Diet Bars.)"
1,ingredients lacking,"I agree with most posters that these seem like good protein bars and taste good. But in the ingredients list, the first ingredient is soy protein isolate. That automatically bombs for me. My reading and limited research believe soy to be an inferior and cheap substitute protein. Whey protein isolate is a higher grade of protein and has more understanding in the long term effects of eating a lot of it.I'm not comfortable with eating soy since all cheap protein bars seem to contain it."
1,Conventional Peanut Butter is used in this Bar,"Conventional peanut butter is one of the most toxic foods on our planet (see ""diet for a poisoned planet"" & other studies). Clif bars generally good and like their chocolate builder bar. Was very surprised to see Clif using conventional peanuts when the rest is reasonably good. If you like regular peanut butter (e.g. skippy, jiff), then this rating is not applicable. Those sensitive to the toxic stuff...."
1,We need stimulus...,That's why I like to eat these. It's also why Subscribe and Save is gone for the Chocolate and instead Harbor Country Bike & Hobby is charging $27.11 + $7.20 shipping for a single box. They'd better come with a golden ticket or these people can die (i.e. chapter 7). Hey Jerks: if you're still in business when the Peanut Butter comes back just leave it alone!
5,Best protein bar you can buy,"As others say, get the Chocolate Mint. It's delicious. One bar is a 20 gram meal substitute. I love them and have one every day. I get them on subscription. I may actually get more every month."
4,Tastes good,"This product tastes good - not like cardboard. Of course flavor choices are personal. However, this had a hint of mint without being, too strong. And was chocolatey without being too sweet to have for breakfast or a snack when you are running out the door. It kept me going without anything else on my stomach for at least 4 hours."
1,Protein bar or candy bar?,"These bars are delicious because they have the saturated fat and sugar content of a candy bar. Sure they have 20g of protein, but they also have 20g of sugar. These bars have 270 Calories, with 8g fat (5g saturated) and 30g carbohydrates (20g sugar). Compare that to a Snickers with 271 Calories, 13g fat (5 saturated) and 34g carbohydrates (28g sugar). Also, instead of whey protein (derived from milk) most of the protein in this bar comes from soy, which has some undesirable toxins, like dehydroalanines, nitrosamines, and furan. There are alternative 20g (whey) protein bars that have with a lot less carbs, sugar, and fat."
2,New Version with Less Crunch?,"I was positively addicted to the Mint Chocolate Builder's Bar and have consumed over a thousand bars over the past two years. The consistency and flavor of these bars was far better than any other protein/energy bar out there, particularly the ""crunchies"" that resembled, as others have described, the consistency of thin mint cookies.The packaging changed recently, and I've noticed a change to the bars. The ""crunch"" is no longer there, and the consistency is much more sawdustlike. Anybody else agree? Still better than most other protein bars, but a far cry from what they used to be. I'm bummed by the changed and need to find a new protein bar. Suggestions, anyone? I'm serious..."
5,Really tasty at a great price,Not too much to say. They are very tasty for being a healthy energy bar and the price is good. I will be buying more.
5,Best tasting protein bar,"Clif Builder Bars are hands down the best tasting protein bars out there. They each contain 20g of solid protein. A big positive point is that they are not artificially sweetened in order to keep the calories down. So if you are watching calories, know that these bars have some sugar.Also be aware that the bars have some sort of chocolate or other type of coating (depending on the flavor) on the outside. This coating which will most definitely melt in the shipping truck during hot summer months. This doesn't affect the taste at all, but it will be a bit messy to eat."
4,Priced right and taste good,"these are much better than powder and great when you do not have time to cook. The price isnt bad and they stay fresh in the wrappers so they are good to bring traveling, etc. The variety of flavors is nice so you dont get board of eating them."
4,Much tastier than the usual,Much better than the usual cardboard bars--but it's still a protein bar so not something you'd have for the culinary experience. Arrived quickly and decent price.
1,Note: dipped in Chocolate,"Doesn't say on the product page, but the peanut butter bars are dipped in Chocolate. FYI for those who can't have Chocolate like myself. Gave 'em away."
5,Clif Builder's built a better bar,Absolutely love this bar. Out of all flavors this is the best in my opinion. When I hit the afternoon candy craving or need some extra nutrition in the morning I go for the Builder's bar.
4,"Maybe not a Snickers, but it satisfies","I need to eat a lot while nursing twins, and this bar does the trick when I can't get proper food. Also, does well with stabilizing my blood sugar. I get the chocolate which is a treat for me and my 6 year old daughter. It may not be a Snickers bar to her, but she loves it almost as much!"
4,Tastey and Filling,"I am a vegetarian runner, so I need lots of protein, and I am a picky eater, so I need it to taste good. This accomplishes both of those. It is dense enough to help fill me up after an 8 mile run, which helps me recover enough to chase my 2 little ones around for 12 hours afterwards."
1,My entire order was expired,"I received my first order of this product on February 28, 2012. The entire order of 10 boxes had expired on February 10, 2012. I ate one bar before I noticed the expiration date and it was extremely dry and tasteless. I will be returning the order. I do not want to receive any more of these unless the expiration date is several months in the future."
5,The best!,"Love these protein bars cause they don't have nutrasweet or aspartame or any of those other totally raunchy, unhealthy ingredients that are so often in the ""health foods"" of this day and age. They are filling and they do give me energy. I've been eating these ones for about 5 years and am very glad they are still being made. I order them repeatedly from Amazon."
3,"I loved it, but...","Recently I took notice of the fact that the saturated fat content in each bar is very high. Total fat is 8g (12%) of which saturated fat is 5g (25%), which is not at all good for your heart. While its high protein (20g) and calorie (270) content could have made this bar a very good option for people who are into building muscles and gaining weight, this one big negative point offsets most of the other great positives. Otherwise, this bar is simply awesome. It's the best tasting protein/energy bar out there, hands down. The price is also reasonable compared to other bars of equal or even lesser nutritional value. Unfortunately from now on, because of the high saturated fat, this won't be my #1 choice of protein bar. Try the Gatorade energy bar instead. While it doesn't taste as good as this one (although the taste is still quite good), the protein (15g) and calorie (250) values are comparable. But the best part is that it only has 1g (5%) of saturated fat."
4,"Great product, price is same as grocery store","I need to eat these for the protein. They taste very good (at least to me and some of the other whack stuff out there). You can find more flavor selection on amazon, but the local store sells these for the same price (less shipping). A break even deal. If you like the flavor, then buy from amazon if they are the only ones who carry it."
3,flavour not what I expected,"These bars have a great texture and I love the 20g protein content but the vanilla almond flavour was almost too sickeningly sweet. I was able to eat them, just not my favourite...I guess stick with what you know and I know I LOVE the chocolate mint builder bar! TASTES SO GOOD!"
5,no corn syrup!,"using this as a meal replacement. Very tasty, but does have about 20 grams of sugar so that might be why. No corn syrup is the best part! Not a thin mint but close enough..."
3,The taste didn't grow on me,"I feel like I've tried most every bar on the market with a balance of carbs and protein. When Clif released these bars I was happy because they were easy to source and I felt like they would be around for a while.Unfortunately, the more of them I ate, the less I liked them. They're still better than the majority of what's on the market, but taste-wise they're not the best.On the plus side, you can trust the natural ingredients Clif uses and these aren't loaded with carbs like so many ""energy"" bars out there.For my tastes, the Luna Sunrise and Mojo lines are preferable - partly because the bars are a little smaller. The Builder bar at close to 300 calories is a little larger than I would prefer as a snack."
4,A great affordable choice,"The Clif Builder's bars have a great taste and are available at a good price. They are quite filling and feature mostly natural ingredients with no hydrogenated oils or high fructose.The chocolate mint is the best flavor in my opinion, but you won't go wrong with another flavor. The only negative thing about these is that thet have soy protein, which contains plant estrogen hormones. However, I believe that Soy Isolate is free of these hormones, so it really is nitpicking."
5,Absolutely delicious,By FAR the best tasting protein bar on the planet. It does have its fair share of the sugar though.
4,"Delicious bar, but too much sugar","I am a vegan who struggles to get my full 50g protein per day, and these bars are a lifesaver. I like the Chocolate best - it's incredibly rich and very satisfying. I usually eat half for lunch and half for dessert!My only issue is that it has a ton of sugar (20g) and is relatively high calorie (270). Granted, it has the best calorie-to-protein ratio of any food I eat, but I feel like they could cut the sugar in half and it would still taste good. That's not stopping me from eating one every day, but people who have a less restrictive diet should think about looking elsewhere.UPDATE: I've stopped ordering Builders Bars from Amazon because several orders in a row have been kind of stale tasting--still within the ""use by"" date, but not as fresh tasting as the ones I buy now from local stores. To me, it's worth the extra few cents to have them fresh!"
3,"good flavor, not-so-good consistency","These are tasty -- kind of like a ""healthy"" candy bar: not that different, really, but you feel a bit more virtuous (and they do have quite a bit of protein, which is good if you're in a bit of a hurry and need some nutrition). The difficulty for me is that these bars seem to be a bit too flaky on the outside, with bits of chocolate just falling off in little shards, so much that you have to be careful when you open these up if you're wearing anything you don't want to get chocolate on."
4,Chocolate Mint,"bought some of these from a local Safeway and tried them out for breakfast. they seem to be a LITTLE rich tasting for me for that early in the morning. they would make a better lunch or snack instead.there is 29 grams of protein, but also 20 grams of sugar. they are a little high in potassium and sodium >200 mg and there is 5 grams of saturated fat to go along with all of that.they taste good, texture (not taste) is like eating day old oat meal with a chocolate casing around it."
2,Crunchy Peanut Butter Too Sweet,"I keep a staple of Builder Bars in my desk drawer, but will not keep the Crunch Peanut Butter ones in the future....just way too sweet that they hurt my teeth. Good taste, but I don't know why they made them so sweet. The Chocolate Peanut Butter bars don't seem to be nearly as sweet. CPB, Chocolate and Chocolate Mint (just like the Girl Scout Cookies) are my three staples."
5,Best high protein bar out there.,"I've had a lot of the protein bars that have around the same protein but had less calories and they taste ok. I really like the taste of these even though they're 270 calories a bar. I have one for breakfast every morning so I go through a lot of these. When and if you ever get bored of the flavor, switch. All the other builder bars have the same calorie and protein content."
2,There are much better ways to get 20g of protein.,"This is a candy bar. Like another reviewer stated -- you do not need 20 grams of sugar to go along with your protein nor do you need 25% of the RDA of saturated fat! Not only are there other protein bars out there, but shakes are very easy to make at home (or take the ingredients with you on the road) and potentially much healthier. You can also get 18g of protein from eating a small container of nonfat yogurt...with zero fat or sugar."
3,"Great, but 270 calories","This is a great bar, but be careful of the fat. Chances are if you are eating bars like this you are being mindful of this sort of thing.270 calories, 70 of which come from fat (8g/12% of your daily). The other flavors might be a bit lower since this one is Chocolate (20g of sugar)."
2,Hot weather and chocolate ain't working,"I love C-builder bars, but the ones I received last week the outer chocolate covering got heated up during transit, so the covering stuck to wrapper and became piddle- rains small bits of chocolate."
5,delicious,no chalky taste with this Clif Builder's bar. And my picky-eater granddaughter asks for them. Great nutrition. Can carry one easily in my purse which keeps me out of the fast-food lane!
1,Tastes like dog chow.,"Actually, I have eaten dog food from Petco and it tasted a little better. Have a drink on hand too because you cannot eat these things without drinking like a pitcher of water. It's like the cinnamon challenge up in here!! You tube that."
4,Great taste,"These bars were a little high in carbohydrates for lean muscle building, but they were very tasty. The positive notes: a great texture offered by the crispy brown rice is balanced by the smooth and almond-y protein layer on top. I'd highly recommend the taste, but if you're looking for something to build lean muscle, go for something with fewer carbohydrates."
5,Best Builder's Bar Flavor,"The nutritional content and ingredient list for these bars are available above so all I can speak to are the taste and texture. I have tried all the Builder Bars and Vanilla Almond has the best flavor. All the Builder Bars have similar texture; crispy, rice-like ""body"" and a candy like coating.FYI, I rank Chocolate Mint second and Peanut Butter third overall."
5,Good bar,"I use these bars as in between meal snacks and usually as a lunch replacement. I get the chocolate, peanut butter mixed box at a local store but that was getting old. I was a bit skeptical about the vanilla almond as I am not a fan of almonds but this bar is great, I do not find a strong taste of almond. I have seen some reviews that stated the bars had past their expiration dates, mine and all of the other bars that I have ever got from Amazon have been well with in the expiration dates."
3,Good story with a hidden message,"This book started out a little slower than I liked, but it eventually got me caught up in the story. I wasn't hooked until halfway through, but at that point I couldn't put it down. The story is about a shy girl that is given lessons by her friends to help her talk to boys. The girl learns, though, that popularity isn't everything that she dreamed it would be."
2,DIdn't sent me what I ordered!!!!,"The product that I have gotten was not and is not the product that I ordered, the picture and the specifictions that companied the item do not match the object that I have in my house. It clearly shows that there is no ipod dock in the picture nor in the specifictions, and yet the mixer that I have dose have that area. In conclution, not a good buy."
1,Did not get what I ordered.,"I ordered this dj set because i had this exact set years ago. When the package arrived it was not was pictured or described on the website. Instead of the Dj turntable Package, I received the iDj. What makes it worse is the Turntables were belt driven. Not sure if the picture and description were wrong or there was a mishap at the warehouse."
2,not better than Java online tutorial,"I am looking for a java secuity book and find this one is a 5-star. After I bought it, I find it teachs me no more than Java Tutorial Security's trail. It doesn't touch detail about what I expected, such as SSL, X.509 or something like that. It focused on Java Security Model, which is less practical and can easily found in Sun's Java tutorial"
4,The Story Is Sometimes Impossible To Tell,"Vice President Spiro Agnew was famous for his verbiage against critics of the Nixon White House. He became infamous for resigning from the post in 1973 to plead no contest to criminal charges of tax evasion and money laundering due to accepting bribes when governor of Maryland.His novel explores a Vice President whose political career is in great jeopardy when caught in a maelstrom of controversy, which is not what it all appears to be within the court of public opinion. Agnew depicts the depths that politics can plummet and how the real story may be lost in the games reserved exclusively for The Beltway.The theme is timeless and Agnew does an excellent job in telling the rest of the story in the chess match of power, where fact and fiction becomes as garbled as truth and lies."
1,The manufacturers and I need to talk......,"I bought this for my twins when they turned 6 months old. They are now 8 months old and I finally opened it. I was very upset by it. The holes in the top where you put the shapes are defective! The triangle one works but the circle says ""square"" and the square says ""circle""!"
2,very hard to understand unless you're one hundred years old,"I don't recommend this book except for it's historical value, it is hard to understand unless you're familiar with the way people talked 150 years ago."
1,Give it a pass,"Looks great , but the stickers don't stick!I tried to use it on painted metal. Should have been a no-brainer, but the stickers just peeled right off.Try another brand."
2,not sticky enough,they did not stick well at all. would not recommend would not buy again. smaller than expected as well. x
1,kawasaki ke100 clutch kit,"Description and picture is deceiving, does not include springs Kit? Clutch plates were as described, Clutch plates are not a clutch kit."
2,Filled with Ex-pat vitriole and luddism,"It certainly seems that the author would rather we not visit Japan, and perhaps he'd rather not live there. He seems to focus entirely on the struggles a Westerner will experience, and focuses very little on the daily interaction and culture of a country with several thousand years of cultural history. But hey, if you're a business-person planning on spending six months working in Japan, Culture Shock Japan might be able to tell you how not to embarrass yourself in very specific corporate interactions...but maybe you might just want to skip the experience altogether.Also, with Tokyo being the nexus of technological advancement, the author too often editorializes with a ""kids these days"" sort of attitude regarding technology and entertainment. I can just picture the typewriter he used when writing the first draft."
2,Disappointing,"The book does contain usefull information, but it left me with an awkward feeling after reading.It describes the 'typically Japanese things' from a personal western point of view, without explaining why, how, what, etc.-Japan is a weird and silly country, but there are nice temples-Or is it the writer that is the culture shock ?If you want an objective book about Japan, keep searching."
1,flimsy piece of crap - no pun intended,"Very light weight - very cheap plastic handle and rod - the handle and rod almost comes apart, unscrews or disconnects with each use - the springs do not offer enough power to scoop a pile of poop from the grass unless it's very small and on top of the grass - I would not buy this item again and don't see how anyone can get much use out of it unless they have a very small dog and virtually no grass in their yard where the dog goes potty - I originally tried it because the picture showed a wooden rod however a very cheap lightweight unit is what was actually shipped."
5,A rare and unique song for long peace!,"This is an amazing work! Rare in the world! Unique. Gorgeous!I just have no word to say, because you have to listening.I heard in Brazil almost 20 years ago in K7 and I kept all in mymemory and cells, never forgot my first new age song...Now living in the USA, I found you again and this CD still the same deep meditation! Amazing CD fromthe years... What a divine inspiration, Patrick! What a gift-Mantra to blow up. You will find a peaceinside and outside for sure!"
5,Gorgeous,"I must echo the previous reviewer - this is a fabulous, lush, moving album. One of the best. Very hard to describe frankly, but give it a shot!"
5,Simply Beautiuful,"Ms. Dries: Your personality nearly glows with what you have learned in your journey....What strikes me is that so much of what you write about is so consistent with other (famous!) Psychologists. And your use of words in clever ways leads me to believe that you could have been a linguist as a profession....You emote warmth, love, caring and, yes, a charming mix of unsertainty and self-esteem."
5,nervous in houston,"OMG- I am a little nervous about buying the dvd caus I have seen them and almost lost my mind at that show. those guys are incredible. I was totally overwhelmed at their performance, the music... just unreal. It IS a must see show. trust me you will be on your feet during the whole show. these guys just take u ther....I am gonna buy the dvd to support the fellas but I know I will be fiending like a crackhead till they tour again! LOL"
5,Excellent!,I have read most of Rampa's books and this one is the best yet. He gives complete analysis on many metaphysics phenomeons. All I have to say is the book says it all.
1,Chapters of Life,Having read many books by T. Lobsang Rampa 25 years ago I found this book to be a disappointment. Rampas' visions of the future have failed to materialise.
2,Shame it is not up to date,"I used to enjoy ""A Catholic Dictionary"" -a 1960 or so edition-, so, I was enthousiast to know there was a newer edition... but when I received it and start to read it, it has been a deception. Not a single mention of the II Vatican Council, for instance! It is just the same edition, page by page and letter by letter. In the entrance ""Mexico, Catholic Church in"" they say my country has 20 million inhabitants, but we are more tan 100 million! Why didn't someone, at the editorial house, revised it? The thelogical truth doesn't change, but our comprehension of it does, and it has been a lot of advance in ecumenism, the limbo, the law of the Church, etc. A Catholic Dictionary has almost just historical interest... if you are not interested in the last 50 years."
1,Not 10'' . Not even close,"I ordered this as a gift to go along with the Olivia saves the Circus book. I ordered it because 10"" would be the perfect size for a one year old. I would have had a happy ending had the Olivia been 10"" it is not. It is 6"". Very dissappointed and a little upset because the product discription is dishonest. I will not purchase from the Book Fair again."
2,"Not 10""","I received this doll today and it is much smaller than 10 inches. I am disappointed but it is not worth it to return it. It looks just as pictured but it is maybe 6"" instead of 10. Just to let you know.. Thanks."
5,My grandson sleeps with Olivia Ringmaster,Gave this to our 2 year old grandson for xmas and he sleeps with her every night. He's hooked on the Olivia tv show and somehow the circus is tops with him.
3,It's OK for a reproduction,"When trying to bring nostalgia for a bygone era into your home, it's better to buy original antiques, rather than items that at first glance look like the original, but in fact don't come anywere close."
1,Broken,"I recieved this item broken. Not one button works, nor do you even get a dial tone out of it. It is a beautiful phone and i'm very disappointed that I have to send it back. I dont recommend purchasing."
2,unhappy,Good morniong I used candle stick phone and the plastic lever that holds the reciever has snaped off .I have disguared phone and will look for a steel type reciever hiolder .Not a really good design for lever holder.Thin plastic.
5,Fantastic!,I dont have time to write a detailed review at the moment but this CD is fantastic! As good or better than LJ's Beatles CD.
1,Barney Laptop doesn't work,"My daughter received this toy for her 2nd B-day and when you change a card it still asks questions about the original card that came inside it. Or if it reconizes that the card was changed it will ask a question & when you answer it it will not finish saying the answer. For example, It will say push the # 4. You push 4 and it will say, ""there are four"" it doesn't finish saying there are four balls or what ever there may be 4 of. This looked so cute in the box. But I'm disappointed that now I have to return it because it doesn't work right."
5,My kids love this toy!,"I feel bad for the people who got defective ones! My 2 yr old girl and 3.5 yr old boy love this toy! They have thrown it around quite a bit, and it always works correctly. The older one knows how to switch the scenery and answer the questions, while my younger one just likes to hit the buttons and point to things. It has lots of buttons and variety, but not hard for kids to figure out. I would hate for anyone to pass up this really cool toy! Just keep your receipt for a bit until you assess you have a ""good"" one. :)"
1,Glad I didn't spend my money on it.,"This was given to my daughter, I would never buy a toy with Barney on it. But, it has helped her recognize numbers and she likes playing with it. However, it has only ever read one of the cards for about 30 seconds, that was the only time I heard it ask questions about the cards. If you push the card in and hold it in, it might recognize it. It does say the right numbers when pushed. There is only ONE SONG that I've ever heard, not the 11 like it says. Perhaps each card has its own song, we wouldn't know.Spend your money on a toy that will actually work."
5,Barney Laptop!,"My twin daughters love the Barney Laptop. I was a little nervous about purchasing the laptop because some reviews stated that it does not work properly. We have had no problems at all. It is great with teaching colors, shapes, and numbers!"
1,poor review,My daughter picked this toy out for her 3rd birthday and it has not worked since we first opened it. It never reads the card that is in the computer window. My daughter is then really confused. We even tried to replace the batteries and that did not work. The toy is durable because my little has tossed it after getting mad that it did not work and it is still in one piece. Don't waste your money.
2,Looks cute but doesn't work properly!,"We bought this for our 17 month old son for Christmas because he really likes Barney, and the ""laptop"" looked so cute. He enjoyed pressing the buttons and flipping the ""computer"" open and closed. But the stickers on most of the cards did not coincide with the questions for the particular cards. We returned the toy to Toys-R-Us. We may get another one in the future, but I would see if it works before I leave the store with it. I'm very disappointed in the poor quality control of the manufacturing. I expect a lot more from Fisher Price. I gave this toy only 2 stars on most ratings because it didn't work properly. I think it has the potential to be very fun & educational, if it would only work right."
1,Same problems...,"Wow...and here I thought it was just a battery issue; but the other reviewers are absolutely correct. Only one or two of the cards work properly. What a shame, too. My two year old has no interest in this toy whatsoever."
2,I think I will by buying another cupcake book,"I bought this booking thinking WOW! With 500 recipes how could I ever want another book? I have tried 2 of the recipes (buying special ingredients from the grocery specifically for these recipes) and I was very disappointed. The cupcakes came out dry and course. I followed the recipe perfectly and I really don't think I will try another recipe. However, there are some really good ideas in this book. I really wanted to make the Key Lime Cupcakes this weekend so I made white cupcakes from a box mix and then followed the directions for the filling and frosting from the book - they turned out great! I'm sure I will use some ideas from this book, but probably not try to make another recipe from scratch."
3,"Good recipes, but some unusual ingredients","While many of the recipes in this book sound great, many call for self-rising flour, which is difficult if not impossible to find in most places (though you can make your own quite easily). Rather than 500 different recipes, it is many recipes with several different variations on each. Also, many of the recipes are really muffins rather than cupcakes. It includes a low-fat section, which I appreciate. I recently made the low-fat pumpkin ginger muffin recipe, and it was okay but not great. Overall, though, it's fun to have a little cookbook with so many cupcake/muffin recipes in it."
1,Blah.,"Mostly, this book gave you one recipe, and things to add to it. I mean, duh, I could make banana blueberry cupcakes by adding bananas and blueberries to a plain cupcake recipe. I'm not an idiot! I wanted new inventive ideas!! I returned this book as soon as I could. Was totally unimpressed."
1,poorly written recipes,"this book is only useful to the experienced baker who is aware of how to mix ingredients in the correct order and with the correct method. on each individual recipe page, the directions for each recipe only tell you to mix together all ingredients. the authors have omitted how to mix and aerate dry ingredients, how to cream your butter and sugar, how to mix your flavorings in with your eggs, and how to get all three of those mixtures together. the book gives aesthically pleasing ideas, but little more. even the recipes themselves don't taste that good."
1,VERY Dry Cupcakes,"I was so excited to get this book, and I was very disappointed. So far, I have made 4 different recipes, and they have all come out so dry that they had to be thrown out! The pictures aren't big enough, and there aren't enough to begin with. All it has is one ingredient variations to make it ""count"" as another of the 500 recipes....Oh...and they aren't all cupcakes....most are muffins...."
1,"After 4 awful tries, the book had to go","I followed AT LEAST 4 recipes in this book (to the ""T""!!) and they ALL came out absolutely disgusting. I'm not exaggerating -- my parents happened to be visiting and I, being the baking fanatic I am, bought this book and immediately began baking them this and that. As polite as they'd try to be, we all agreed that these ""THINGS"" were simply inedible! This has got to be one of the worst cookbooks on the market. Don't waste your time, energy, money, or ingredients on this one!"
1,Not worth it!,"I too, was like most others thinking.. omg the only cupcake book I will EVER need! BIG FAT JOKE! The cupcakes do not taste good! They are mediocre at bestThis book, while having many varieties does not have 500 completely different recipes. The cupcake recipes are mostly all the same with some minor changes, adding chocolate, or vanilla.The book should really advertise as 500 frostings, because that is the only thing that consistently changes."
2,Cute cover! But lacking,"I've been given this book as a gift on three different occasions, probably because it's such a cute little book about something seemingly impossible to mess up - cupcakes! But the author of this book somehow managed to do it.You'll notice when you make the first batch that the batter comes out more like brownie batter than cake batter, which I thought was strange, but not necessarily bad. Then cupcakes literally came out like cornmeal muffins you'd make from a mix - DRY AND CRUMBLY. I tried a few other recipes just to make sure that wasn't one that had a typo in it and, no, all the cupcakes this book's recipes produces are dry, dry, dry.Don't fall for the cute packaging."
2,Pretty book but....,"I wish I read reviews before attempting to make cupcakes for the first time from this book. It's true that what you bake will be more on the dry side...or more like muffins. I always thought Cupcakes as being an inspiring exciting treat and what I created from this book today almost made me cry! I did the peanut butter cupcakes with peanut butter frosting...which I know sounds like a lot of peanut butter but it was for the kids. Anyway, they were a complete dissapointment! So of course I came to Amazon to see what reviewers said (in case it was not me) and sure enough...it was NOT me! I almost gave up as a baker because of this book! But 2 stars I give, again, for the pictures."
1,Don't waste your time,This is a terrible cookbook. Every recipe I've tried is a disappointment. And I'm not new to baking. The recipes seem untested and the results always leave much to be desired.
1,Worst Cucakes Ever!!,"I am an experienced cupcake baker with my own cupcake blog so I'm no amateur when it comes to making cupcakes.I gave this book 1 star only because there is no ""zero star"" rating. The White Chocolate Macadamia Nut cupcake has to be one of the worst cupcake recipes on record. Very dry, sweet but with little other flavor. The cupcake is dense and tough, not the least bit appealing.I decided to give it another try to be fair so I made the Chai cupcake. I've made these before with other recipes and they were delicious, tender and light. Not this one. Dry, dry,dry and again with little flavor. Not sure how this book got rated 5 stars by some readers but not by me. Don't bother unless you want to throw out a couple dozen cupcakes."
3,either too dry or to bland,"Unfortunately, even though the book looks cute and has some very interesting recipes in it, after making 2 I am giving up. They are either to dry or too bland and I followed the instructions exactly. I have had better luck whipping up recipes as I go!Also, the constant request for self rising flour made choosing the right recipe pretty difficult. Go to [...] if you want great recipes that work! and it's free."
2,Food Porn,"This is a very attractive cookbook. The photos of the cupcakes and muffins are breathtaking and have really inspired me over the past few months to adapt my own time-tested recipes to create new things. Past that, though, the book's usefulness has run out.I don't have a problem with the fact that the recipes are largely variations on theme, or that not all 500 are ""true cupcakes."" My problem lies in the recipes' inaccuracies. Due to the lack of milk, the batters have consistencies closer to scones than real cupcakes, and when a recipe tells me the yield is ""one half dozen"" I shouldn't end up with twelve. Two cups of flour, a cup and a half of zucchini and a half cup of olive oil is way too much for six muffins, unless you're using a giant muffin pan, and those weren't even mentioned. These little problems make me wonder if the recipes were even tested at all.Use the book for inspiration, but stick to your own trusted recipes."
2,Beautiful pictures/Poor Formulas,"I've made several of these recipes, and have generally gotten terrible results. And the quantity each recipe says it makes is way off on the ones I tried.It appears as though the author has taken one recipe and then extrapolated what *might* work in other situations--without actually testing the formulas. I'm not even talking about the ""variations"" that help bolster the ""500 cupcakes"" claim. The basic recipes simply don't work well.So this is really more of a theoretical cookbook, and unfortunately the theory doesn't hold up in real life.The pictures, however, are lovely."
2,Not what I expected.,"This cookbook was not what I expected. First of all the ingredients were not normal ingredients that I bake with. I don't use super fine sugar, I just use granulated and brown sugars. Where I live you don't find a lot of super fine sugar in the grocery store. Other ingredients were not common baking ingredients for me either. If you have all the ingredients at easy access then it is not a bad cookbook, but if you are like me and don't use those ingredients or have access to them than I wouldn't recommend this cookbook.It had some good ideas and suggestions but it is based on a few key recipes and then you add to them. Now for me making some of those just didn't work. They weren't good combos and I felt they would be better with a full recipe instead of just being add-ins to a base recipe. So I give this 2 out 5 stars. Good ideas just not a good outcome."
4,Cupcake Companion,"This is more of a coffee table book than a cook book.If you love cuipcakes, you will love this book!"
2,Muffins are Cupcakes Ugly Cousin,"Although 500 Cupcakes offer you a ton of recipes, as repetitive as they are, they sadly consider muffins and cupcakes the same thing. This is something I just can not forgive. Any cake (note I said cake, not muffin recipe) can be turned into cupcakes. The only thing left is how are you going to decorate it. For that, I would suggest the book Hey There Cupcake to give you fun ideas. Otherwise, I did enjoy some of the more offbeat recipes and have enjoyed experimenting with cupcake's ugly cousin. :)"
3,Cupcakes,I am not totally thrilled with this book. I was looking forward to 500 totally different recipes although that might have been too high of an expectation for a cupcake book. And I like pictures. This book is set-up in sections of different cattegories of cupcakes and then you have maybe 6-8 bases for cupcakes and then an entire page dedicated to different things that can be added to that base to create a different cupcake. So you have pictures 6-8 pictures for the base cupcakes and then 6-10 variations for each base cupcake. I think so much can be done with cupcakes...so I am still looking for the perfect cupcake cookbook.
2,my review title,This was given to me as a Christmas present from someone who pretty much hates my guts......enough said?
4,Great start for those looking for a wide range of baking recipes,The 500 cup cakes provides 125 recipes for a variety of cup cakes from everyday use to special occasions. Each of the 125 recipes has four minor variations that tweak the item into a different version by adding a new flavor profile. Overall it is an average cookbook but for those who are skilled in baking like my wife it provides base recipes that can then be used to make their own variations while using this as a widespread springboard and because the recipes are chosen for easy variations they lend themselves to creating your own as well. We have only found a few recipes to be a little vague on the directions but overall have not had too many problems with this book. Overall well recommended for those that are looking for a lot of cake recipes that can be built on.
3,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED!!,"Cupcakes are all a rage right now and I've jumped on the band wagon. I was looking for a cookbook full of recipes that I could ""show off"" with at my many family functions. Needless to say, this book wasn't it. It does have 500 recipes as it states but most of them are recipes that I would not find myself using. Most of the book is recipes for savory muffins, muffins and healthy alternative muffins. I ask you, Who wants to eat a healthy cupcake??? Not I. I wanted ideas to help me create beautiful fancy cupcakes that would impress the hard to impress. I found what I was looking for in the Wilton Cupcake Book. Thanks Wilton"
3,Great ideas for experienced bakers,"The ideas in this book are very creative and I've gotten many compliments on cupcakes I've made using this book. I wouldn't recommend this book to a novice baker, though, because the recipes I've tried have all required a good bit of tweaking. For instance, many of the recipes require either more liquid or different amounts of ingredients than the recipe called for."
4,Old School Punk Roots,"First of all, 'hardcore punk' is hardly a genre. Old School punk is the technical term, and it's basically early thrash. Slayer does an impressive job covering these classics, though some of the songs aren't so classic to begin with. Highlights include the infectious ""Abolish Government/Superficial Love"", ""Spiritual Law"", ""Mr. Freeze"", and ""Memories of Tomorrow"" and ""Sick Boy"" off the expanded. The last track ""Gemini"" is pure Slayer, not a cover, for those who found this albums disappointing. ""Gemini"" features some of Tom's best vocals plus great lyrics and riffing. I recommend this to Slayer fans, metal fans, and 'real punk' fans."
5,Thrash played by thrash metallers,If there was no thrash there would not be Slayer. If there was no punk there would not be Slayer. You listen to RIB and love all the new metalcore crap but you give this album a score of less than three stars?!
1,Slayer???,"The one star I gave this cd is for the one song that I like: Gemeni. As for the rest of the cd, well... maybe Slayer should have just kept the songs to themselves. However, the rest of their cd's I all gave a well deserved 5 stars."
3,Slayer= Undisputed,"Slayer is the kind of band that can't do anything bad, and this is proof. Taking 80's punk songs and making them great but still able to hear that it's Slayer. Although I'm a bigger fan of traditional Slayer (their actual own material), this is still a good album. Thier cover of ""Mr. Freeze"" is pretty sick too. Check this out only if you're curious to hear how it is, but if you're someone who doesn't care that they did this c-d, just stick to Slayer's own stuff."
2,UNslayer,"This album goes against pretty much everything Slayer has accomplished. This is nowhere near as good as their earlier albums. In my opinion this album is a waste of plastic. Its ok to listen to when theres nothing else...but if you have some older Slayer laying around then thats what you should be reaching for. This album is just too ""Punk-Rockish"". All in all its just very UNslayer."
2,meh,"i like a little bit of it, doesent mean its good, i wont throw it away or anything, ill just let it sift...wait...and look at the album cover most of the time. slayer is getting better though."
1,another one of slayers stinkers,"too much screaming and cursing, repetitive beats not slayer at all. skip this stinker."
1,This Cd Sucks!,"I thought this cd was the worst pile of crap I have ever heard from Slayer. It is nothing like Show no Mercy and Reign in Blood. Covering punk song which already sound awful, I feel that slayer should stay how they started- sounding like music."
1,"""Undisputed Sellouts"" is more like it","Slayer goes punk? I've only got one thing to say about that: SELLOUTS!!! Slayer, you guys better go back to metal, or else you'll lose millions of fans all over the world, just like Metallica did when they sold out! Slayer should stick to what they do best: in your face thrash metal! A brutal band like you has no business playing that punk sh.it! What were you guys thinking? Slayer goes punk? Whats next, Slayer covers Green Day's Greatest Hits? This is by far the worst album ever released by a metal band! Even worse than Metallica's Black Album in 1991!"
5,The music that will make you change your religion!,"This album has been right up there in Slayer's top three best albums. The guitar riffs on this album are crazy! They start really slow and then it turns into freakin speed metal.This album is for the ultimate head-banger!If you like to get angry and beat the living (you know what) out of someone than this album will help you in doing so.Kerry King's guitar solos will blow you away. Paul's drums are like earthquakes, Jeff's rhythm is freakin' harsh, and Tom araya has the loudest, death-defying voice.This album isn't so much about the devil and all that stuff, but more about the violence, misanthropia, and the scorns ofevery-day life.Slayer is like the Iron Maiden of this generation.I have three words for you...GET THIS ALBUM!!!"
5,Slayer Shreds Again,"This is definitly an awesome album, espeically for Punk/Hardcore fans such as myself. Slayer plays the songs true, but stamps their own style on it, making the songs balls out insane. Alot of people don't seem to like it because they aren't punk fans, or think they are sellouts(?), but Slayer were all huge punk fans (obviously) and that greatly influenced their sound. Hell, they even played with Verbal Abuse back in 84! The Dr. Know cover (Mr. Freeze) is incredibly dark, and a personal favorite. A great change of pace for Slayer if you ask me."
2,CameraMate reader malfunctioning,My Cameramate reader was working all well till I connected to my home PC's USB port. It started malfunctioning and it is not getting detected in any systems thereafter. I am not sure about the reason behind this.
4,"Fluffy, but interesting","This film is the archtypical regency romance. There is the playboy duke and of course, the beautiful and virtuous heroine - subordinated and yet spirited. Although the premise of this story is highly unrealistic, this novel is a diversion from everyday work and allows the reader to drift into the fantasy world. There are, however, a few problems with this story that prevented me from giving it five stars. The lovers lack cohesive communication. Call me a 90s girl, but I definitely think that the misunderstanding between Ashleigh and Brett was prolonged unnecessarily. If the two understood an inkling about each other a lot of things in this story would not have taken place. Moreover, there were a couple of scenes that were reminiscent of the era when romance writers incorporated bodice-ripping scenes into their work. However, put all these flaws aside and let your mind drift into an unreal world...it is a pleasant adventure."
3,hmmm....so so,"I was trying to follow the Cold Buckwheat Noodle Soup recipe. I couldn't find beef satay in the grocery store to save my life. I even went to a Korean store. Maybe, it's named differently. I looked up the the definition of Beef Satay. I still couldn't figure it out. Maybe my college degree was worthless, or perhaps this book isn't all that friendly to me. I'm trying another Korean Cookbook."
4,A nice compilation of favourite Korean recipes,"A wonderful book with easy-to-follow recipes! I had attempted about half of the recipes, and they all had been wonderful cooking experiences thus far. A word of caution: if ""really"" spicy or savoury food is not your cup of tea...tone down the red pepper & coarse salt amounts as indicated in the recipes."
4,Beautiful Book,"This book is beautiful and heartwarming. I have found mistakes in the recipes however. Perhaps clarification was needed but the recipe for seaweed soup called for 15 ounces of dried seaweed. Did she mean 15 ounces after it was rehydrated? Because about 1 ounce of dried seaweed is more than enough. Still, the recipes are easy to follow and the pictures and stories will touch your heart. I have made some of the dishes for my Korean boyfriend and he has been pleased."
3,below my expectations,"Being korean-american, I guess my expectations were too high. I thought that since, the authors of this book were korean, that this book would help me hone my korean cooking skills. I was very disappointed because there are not that many recipes contained in the book and also many of the techniques used are not traditional. The recipes turned out okay, but they seemed to be lacking something. The ingredient list and techniques used seemed to be simplified so that they would be easier for nonkoreans. However, for someone who is unfamiliar with korean food in general, there are not enough pictures to help them. There are 8 pages of pictures and six of them contain pictures of finished products."
5,This is the best Korean cook book by far!,"This book has wonderful glossary under the title ""moms shopping list"" which explains all the ingredients and how they are usually prepared. Also, this book has all the family style dishes that are not in many of the other Korean cook books. For someone who grew up eating Korean food and is now living in a place where it's not available at all, this is a life saver."
3,Just out of reach,"Just as my title implies, I found this book of ""home cooked"" recipes to fall just out of reach of my expectations. Being half Korean I have begun a collection of recipe books in order to enjoy the foods that I have grown up with. I will say that this book was the most satisfying I have come across so far, the others being so Americanized that they were a joke, or so vague and nondescript that I wasn't sure if I was preparing it properly. My problems with this book were the same as those that others have previously stated. The recipes were not as varied as I had hoped for and centered on familiar/common foods such as bulgogi and bibimbop, typically American favorites. The foods were also somewhat Americanized, as I found out when I cooked them for my Korean mother. She was quick to point out the differences. Still, overall it's better than most, and provided the basic steps for recipes that I could alter during cooking to suit my taste and memory."
5,"A wonderful, wonderful book!","I love this book! My mother is Korean so I was raised in a Korean and American household. Thus, I love Korean food! Having spent most of my life in the states, I don't get to eat good Korean food often enough though. My mom can cook all of my favorites wonderfully, but I have trouble learning from her because there are no ""set"" amounts for some of the spices and ingredients. This book makes it all easy. It has my four favorite Korean dishes--kimchee, duk gook, kimbop, and bibimbop (yum!)--in addition to many other traditional dishes. The book itself is beautiful and I love the personal stories and pictures from Jenny Kwak's life. Another nice touch is the Korean text and correct Korean pronounciation for each of the recipe titles. You will enjoy this book. The recipes are easy to follow and deliciously flavorful."
2,"""Last of the Mohicans ""camcorder","I bought this camera thinking since it was VHS it would perform better in low light (as did my older 8mm)than a digital one. WRONG. It also will drain the battery in 15 minutes. Resolution is poor with VHS mode and svhs tapes cost too much. Noisy tape makes me weary. Don't waste your money on this old""last of the mohicans"" format. Just get a digital camcorder and buy a light.My $299. digital Sharp blows it away. I can't hardly give it away. Want mine for $150?"
4,Great Reference,This book is well written. It would be helpful if there were questions and the end of the chapter.
3,"Developers are also in a certain way architects, so read it","As the title of my review says this book is intended for all the people who want to architect and develop web services in a proper way. The technology around Web Services is very splitted. I mean from a lot of separate web associations. When you want to master web services technology you have to know in detail XML, XML Schema, SOAP, UDDI and its support in J2EE.This book gives architectual overview how these technologies depend on each other, I mean the relationships.The book is not intended for getting detail information about source code implementation. Anyway, it is from the SUN Blueprint program team. So everybody developing and architecturing web services with J2EE technology should read this book. It is a very dry book. Very talkative. I am glad I have already read it."
1,waste money,"there is an online free copy, and the content is not useful for building a real web services application"
5,Solaris Universalis beautiful to listen to,I had this years ago and don't know whatever happened to it. I am glad to have it in my collection of metaphysical music again. Beautiful and easy listening.
2,Read with Caution,"Funding local churches and missions is nothing new. Long term studies have shown that it actually kills church growth instead of stimulating it. Having a salary with no accountability is every pastor/missionaries desire but it is their eventual downfall. I have seen enough local pastors' wives with black eyes from beatings and worse things to remind everyone reading this book. If its too good to be true, it isn't."
4,Fast and Easy to Use,"I purchased this product because of Panasonic's excellent reputation. They did not dissappoint. The large easy to read display is fantastic! An ever better item is the colored range level indicators. If your systolic or diastolic ranges are high, it will flash a color to let you know that your blood pressure is too high. It also saves previous measurements and allows you to compare and two can use it.The only drawback is that the cuff is a little too small. Otherwise the self inflating to read and deflating when your reading is ready is great! I highly recommend this product!"
4,Good BP machine,"I purchased this product for my Mom to use. We have gone through 2 Omron units and I was not pleased with the accuracy of the results and longevity of the machine, so I decided to try a different brand. Other Panasonic products have performed well for me in the past, so I was pleased to find that a Panasonic brand BP machine was available.I reviewed the features and purchased it.My Mom is a strong 82 y.o. She received the package and was able to assemble the unit and use it immediately without my involvement. I see this a positive feature.I have also used it myself. It is very easy to use, the digital readout is very legible and the buttons are large and easy to understand the controls.It has only been in use for about 1 mo. now, but it is performing as expected.The only thing would have wanted as a feature on the machine was an AC adapter to use house current to power the machine, instead of battery only."
3,Erratic Behavior,The readings vary a lot even if you measure in quick succession. We figured it shows the measure on the higher end and to get a realistic measure just subtract 10 from both the readings (according to my boyfriend)!!
2,Monitor,"When I ordered the item I didn't realize that it was only battery operated. This was the main reason that I returned the item, although I felt that the cuff was not as comfortable as I would have liked."
4,Easy to use but inconsistent,"I bought this cute panasonic monitor to check my blood pressure between doctors visits and while I'm on medication. Although, I like the size of it and that I can store the readings, I am a little dissapointed with the validity of each reading. I usually take 2 on left and 2 on right to make sure I get the same reading, however the first reading is always off about 5 points up. This is not a big deal for me since I know what my pressure is and I just want to stay in my range.ProsCompact/ligthweightEasy to useConsInconsistency in multiple reading done in the same time frame"
4,Good product,This is a good product... I bought it for my mom.. she uses it regularly which gives her almost accurate results.. Its a good utility. Must have!
5,Easy to use and accurate reading,This monitor is the best among the three I have used in the past ten years.
5,Highly recommended,"Great value for the price. Simplicity, speed,accuracy are a major plus. I don't see any negatives. Highly recommended."
2,pointless,"In this book Gardner tries to answer questions about his own world view - ""democratic socialist who believes in God"". His chapters start with questions like: Why am I not a solipsist? Why am I not a determinist? Why do I believe in God? Unfortunately almost all of his answers boil down to ""just because I believe so"". I've also found the statement ""nobody knows better than a democratic socialist"" (repeated verbatim several times) quite annoying.While I like Gardner's other work this book is really pointless."
1,"Good effort, not rigorous enough","I read parts of this book for a class assignment, where I had to identify the different paradigms which Gardner uses in his assertions. Basically, Gardner's reasoning is science-centric; even his declarations of faith fall back on science and reason. He also does a good job of artifically separating faith and reason. He is surprisingly ethnocentric, as in one of his refutations of cultural relativism that asserts that certain ""primitive"" societies do not meet basic needs as well as other societies. He uses pragmatic proofs to refute pragmatism, seemingly without knowing it. Basically, all his conclusions rested on Western principles that are easily deconstructed, that he apparently had not thought about deeply enough. This book shouldn't have survived the 80's. Buy something by Derrida instead."
5,Gardner is a national treasure...,"Gardner's essays, many of those in this volume, have helped me work through some of my own issues with respect to belief in God, faith and science. Gardner is one of my personal heros and virtual mentors."
1,a poor beginning,"Im on my way to travel Ecuador and Peru and spend time on high alititude.This book only handles a few major citys and a few hostels, poor maps and just ordinary warnings that you should be careful in bus stations and when its dark.Quite useless for me."
4,excellent,"This is not what I expected from Steamhammer, but you know what, I'll take it.I had them pegged as a blues band after hearing the excellentMountains, which you also have to attain for its amazing jam of ""Driving Down The Avenue.Speech goes, and goes deep, into progressive terrain: multi part songs hugging all genres. The sound is huge, epic slaps of guitar that define this as 70s art rock.But Speech is never deliberately artsy, and all the parts that are there seem in proper place. This band never made a splash--they must have fallen in that crack between ELP and Deep Purple. But they rock as hard as one and do prog far more classy than the other,Crack this."
2,Not as appears,The buffet table that I received was a different color than advertised and the wood seemed very plasticy. It seemed nice for storage but it was not really the look that I was going for.
1,A list is about all this book provides,"This is not a very informative book. It moreless provides a list of businesses that you can do for under $2000, but thats about all it provides. I am very disappointed, as I was looking for something that gave guidance, information and tools."
5,great movie,"This is such a fun film I never get tired of it. I love the dark humor of the dysfunctional family on Christmas eve. Yep we all have them and they are funny. Love all the characters, wish they would do an updated version of this film. with all the same actors."
2,Not worth the money,"I ordered this book for my daughter for Christmas. While there were a few pages of good information, it's mostly blank pages to put in your own recipies. Not at all what I was expecting and a very embarrassing gift. It was especially embarrassing since I'd ordered two other Alton Brown books for my other daughter and my husband. While the other two people were enjoying and sharing all the great information, my oldest shared blank pages. Embarrassing for both of us."
1,IT IS ALL BLANK,"Dear Alton. I love your shows, but this book is a very serious dissapointment.ALL THE PAGES ARE BLANK...............WHAT WERE YOU THINKING."
3,it's small,"OK, before ordering this I understood that it was largely a blank book; basically a kitchen notebook with a bit of the Alton Brown charisma thrown in. That was fine, since I was buying it used cheaply. (Turns that didn't work out, as the loose-leaf bound book was missing most of the 160 pages, so I returned it.) But I won't be buying another to replace it because I was also disappointed with how small it was. Looking at the book details, I do see that the size is listed but I had missed that earlier. If you are considering buying this, please do be aware that this does not hold standard 8.5"" X 11"" paper. That said, if you are satisfied with buying a smallish, kitchen notebook, this was a high quality item. Well-made binder, pleasing thick pages, etc."
5,Actual help in the kitchen,"I recommend this book, especially for all new or tentative cooks. Actually, for everyone who isn't Julia Child. Don't expect to find a typical cook book full of recipes, although there are some included. This is more of the ""Cooking for the Academically-inclined"" person.He has condensed years of experience and education into delicious, bite-sized--and perfectly seasoned with humor--servings. He explains things that you may have taken for granted, such as types of heat, how to salt food, why not to blindly follow a recipe. It becomes clear as to why these things are important, and why you may have experienced some food-failures in the past. This is a useful book, covering a wide spectrum of cooking situations that you will want to read at least once and keep for future reference."
2,Not worth the money,Ordered all 3 Alton Brown books. The cooking and baking books are loaded with info for curious cooks and bakers. The kitchen manual you could do without and your money could be better spent buying a good 3 ring binder and some good paper for making notes and writing down recipes.
2,not worth the money,"Someone bought me this so called...book...not worth the cash. If I had seen it in the store, I would just have gone to the office supply aisleand bought a three ring binder for 99 cents and made it myself. But his other real books are good."
1,Disappointed,"Unfortunately, this ""book"" is basically just a ring-binder with blank pages and pockets for your own recipes.I was expecting an Alton cookbook - with his Good Eats recipes & pictures. I was NOT expecting a ringbinder filled with blank pages, and a few pages with information such as oven temperature conversions. Perhaps I misread the Amazon description.If you're looking for an actual Alton Cookbook, get his ""I'm Just Here for the Food: Food + Heat = Cooking"" book instead. If you're looking for an overpriced repository for your own handwritten recipes & notes, buy this."
1,Unreadable,"The author seems knowledgeable in the area he covers, but, unfortunately, can't write: there isn't one clear paragraph in the whole book, not one coherent chapter -- this book reads like a transcript of a mental patient's ranting: disjointed and random, ungrammatical, having no logical structure, no direction; with concepts used w/o being defined before (or after!); wrong words used all the time (or, alternatively, missing a word now and then) -- all in all, a sizeable load of gibberish that's torture to parse and impossible to understand. Even vector math itself is not defined!The author, if he must write at all, should team up with a competent technical writer, maybe as a coauthor, especially since the publisher, Wordware (based on my observations, a second-rate outfit in general) doesn't seem keen on providing adequate editorial contribution"
1,Hartz Rawhide Chew Sticks Pack of 20,MADE IN CHINA..Even our dog food has gone the way of the Hershey Kiss. I won't be back to this vendor.Will be looking for made and sold in AMERICA only.....
4,This Old Fix,"This is a great addition to my Time-Life library. Having been a fan of the This Old House program for many years and a subscriber to their magazine, I thought I had seen everything. I was wrong. This volume really shows the detailed steps necessary to make your projects come to life. Since I picked up this book I have taken on the daunting job of building my own deck, and laying a new hardwood floor. Many of the techniques I used came from this book, and at the very least it made me believe that almost no home improvement project is beyond my meager skills. A great place to start, and to gain some confidence."
3,Good Book,"Just a good book. Liked it enough to stay up late to finish it. Sometimes I did want to smack the hero, but for me that is normal."
4,Good Dream Book,"I was amazed to look through this book and see that there was an interpretation for my dream about Keanu Reeves. I just couldn't believe it. It was fairly accurate as well. Most of the other entries in this book say nothing different than my other dream interpretation books; however, Ariadne's book is useful for its interpretation of contemporary symbols. This aspect makes the book truly unique. I just had to buy it for that one reason."
4,This Watch is UNISEX ONLY,"Buyer please do be aware that this watch is a unisex watch only! I received mine today and the seller informed me this is the ONLY way it is available. This is the truth on this watch, I love mine, its beautiful, but its a mens size watch!"
1,This cable is a waste of money,"I was confident that the bad reviews were not truth. But believe it, they are... the cable doesn't work good, in fact, for me it's better to remain with the original AV cable."
5,Cheap cable that is the same thing,You can either buy this for cheap or the same thing overpriced from Nintendo. Its not really a tough choice.
1,Dead on Arrival.,"It didn't work. Cross checked it against a genuine cable. I guess its a shot in the dark since some people had it work, but mine didn't. So i don't care to be friendly about it."
2,not so great,"Cable made the wii picture darken slightly and ever so often there are thin lines of static (hardly noticeable) that will go across the screen. My children don't have any issues with it, but they are 6 & 7. Not a quality product."
1,Horrible cheap piece of junk! Do NOT buy!,"This cable worked for about 3 days. Now the resolution is green. Move the cable around or jimmy it a bit, and the green goes away. Then it comes back. It's just a cheap piece of junk. I wish I could give it negative stars, that's really what it deserves."
5,works like it should,Don't know if there are better ones out there but if you have to have a component cable because that is all your TV takes then get this one. It is cheap and it works.
5,Nice upgrade for 3 bucks.,Works great...gives a very slight resolution upgrade (from 480i to 480p). Not going to change you wii world. I got this cable so I could travel my wii with the old component cable and not have to get behind my tv to unplug and replug as much. Bottom line the product is comparable to nintendo's $20 cable so get this one instead.
4,"works nicely, turned into a good risk for a cheap price","Works as advertised. I was a little wary due to the variety of reviews, but most seemed okay with the product... so I took a risk. Quality of make seems fine, produces good output. No complaints."
4,Didn't improve on S-Video imo.,"I had my Wii connected with S-Video before, and this made little difference. I did update the video option for 480P.The Wii looks TERRIBLE on my 120"" screen. DVDs are also 480P/24 and look good upscaled on my Pre/ProI wouldn't expect much from this.My setup:Epson 8350 Projector (1080P)120"" Elite ScreenEmotiva Pre/Pro"
1,"Bad video, pood audio, fast delivery","The cable arrived quickly. Unfortunately despite having made all the correct setting adjustments on the WII for my HDTV the picture is full of lines, my WII is mostly colorblinded and the audio is squeaky/scratchy. I will have to buy the $35 WII to get the proper quality. It looked too good to be true."
4,Cheap and does its thing,"This cable works the way it supposed to. Since I don't have Netflix on the Wii, I can't really tell if the quality improved that much, but it's definitely better.One thing to keep your eyes on is that the connectors are not named. Because there is a red connector for both audio and video, you need to pay attention to which one is which. The easiest way for me to figure out which connector goes where is by looking at the back of my TV, they receptacles should be in the same order as the connectors as ordered by the cable. You can also tell by the color of the mid section of the connectors - gray for audio if I remember correctly.So it's cheap and does what it supposed to do, it does feels a bit flimsy due to the light weight, but it works just fine for me."
1,"I went cheap, got cheap, get the official wii component","I used to have the official nintendo cable but lost it, so i decided not to spend another 35 for it and go cheap. First of all i must say i applaud the seller got this to me fast, thats about the only good thing. The cable feels sturdy but the shielding is terrible. It works fine on 480i setting of course, but once u go to 480p and anything other that the wii is hooked up to tv it will start to show horizontal lines of noise. I tried it on several tvs and same issue, and just imagine what u get when u hook it up to your receiver and u have 6 other things running through it (yes i tried terrible). So i threw this cable away and gave in letting nintendo win with their outrageously overpriced cable (that works), i didnt want to hassle with no name cables again more chance of getting a defective product."
4,Consistent with description,"Consistent with its description and the other comments, this cable provides a slightly improved picture IF you have a nice HDTV to plug into. I believe it's worth it for the price."
5,Works as intended,"I recently upgraded from a standard definition TV to a high def one. I bought these cables so I could enjoy my Wii games and streaming netflix through Wii at a higher def. While I didn't do a side by side comparison of results, when I first hooked it up the screen felt ""brighter and more crisp"".I'm pleased with this product. It works as intended and was a good price. I recommend"
3,Good enough for the price,"This cable made some of our games a little crisper, slightly brighter, and a little better. However, it is not a remarkable improvement. It is worth having b/c the difference it made is helpful. Do not pay more than $10 for this cable, that includes shipping, or you will be very disappointed. If you can't find it cheaper than that, then don't worry you won't miss out. Anyone who tells you it made a huge visual difference, probably paid too much and is trying to justify it to themselves. No, the cables are the nicest quality out there but they aren't crap either. For the price and what it gives you, it is justified."
1,Cable sucked on my Sony Bravia,"This cable is HORRIBLE, I used it on my brand new 40"" Sony Bravia LCD HDTV and the color was horrible, the clarity was very poor, and the sound was disgraceful. I'm definitely returning this cable."
4,Wii Component Cables,"The generic Wii component cables greatly improve the appearance of all Wii games, even though the Wii only provides EDTV (480p) performance. These cables were well worth the investment."
5,works great !!!,worked great on my Wii.. greatly improves picture. haven't noticed any lines other reviewers have mentioned.. quality seems top notch.
1,DOA.,Well it just never worked right. The cord has a short in it and I could get it to work on if I held it at a sharp angle. picture was clearer(sharper) ....But it would cost more to return it than to just take the loss. Sad to see it not work. I guess you get what you pay for. And exchange was not an option.
4,"this is not a game, it's a wire","it was real cheap, but it works perfect. i use it for my wii to my flat screen and it was a noticeable improvement in picture quality. you have to change the settings in the wii itself. but after you do this it was DEFINITELY worth the upgrade. nintendo should ship the device with this wire to start with."
3,Not original Artists,"This is a nice collection of music but beware the songs are not by the original artists !Drews famous 60's Greatest Love Songs and Bubblegum Pop are ""ALL NEWLY RECORDED DIGITALLY MASTERED MUSIC FEATURING THE HIT CREW"" not original artists.I wish I knew this before I made the purchase. I should have known that the price was too good to be true.If you are looking for original songs this one is not for you, don't make the same mistake that I did."
3,"Review of Gilgamesh, David Ferry translation","There have been many translations of this Sumerian story over the years due. David Ferry's translation is rather readable; Ferry's decision to write the story in heroic couplets of iambic pentameter makes the story easily accessible and easy to follow. Gilgamesh deals with many issues traditionally found in epics. The Sumerian Prince learns of loyalty and friendship through his one companion, Enkidu. There are battles of epic proportion; the companions battle the forest monster, Howawa, and the bull of heaven. Gilgamesh even sojourns to the land of dead, which reminds readers of Odysseus' journeys. The text is occasionally repetitive, but one would expect that of an epic. It's length and ease of readability make it attractive, however. Qualms with the story itself aside, Ferry has produced an admirable translation."
4,The Relaxing Version,"It is no secret that Ferry ignored many of the laws of translation and compiled a much more modern version of the story. For people who have never read Gilgamesh and would like to enjoy the story without fretting over the basic intellectual and scholarly elements, this is exactly what you want to read. It is poetic, relaxing, and enjoyable."
3,A student's veiw...,"Okay, I am not an expert on ancient history, nor do I read much from Sumerian times. Having said that, I did have to read ""Gilgamesh"" for a history class, and while it is a very good story (fellow students-you won't be bored), Ferry's translation is not the way to go. First, it is written in poetry form. Unless that is something you are looking for, I just believe it makes the story unclear. Secondly, and let me remind you I am not a scholar; the lines did not flow well. Ferry's interpretation also seemed to deviate from other editions I have read. 3 stars, because if you know what you are looking for, this translation is not without merit.And one final thought, I liked the Penguin Classics translation by N.K. Sanders. It was clearly written, in a story form. Plus, there is a lot of background information, historical facts and footnotes to guide the reader."
3,"Polemic, but good","When you read this book, keep in mind Bork sold out to the populist critics of Microsoft for a fee, and repudiated this book. Which proves that economic theory is great at the macro level, but, at the micro level, game theory beats out.This is why gains for many are cancelled out by gains for a few that are willing to lobby government (or serve as expensive consultants to their paymasters, as in the case of Bork)And why economics is but an extension of politics, and, at the end of the day, even inefficient economics can propigate for years, decades, centuries and even millinieums (India, China)."
1,"Misinterpreting the word ""efficiency""","I have enjoyed other writing by Judge Bork. Unfortunately, in ""The Antitrust Paradox"" Judge Bork misinterprets the word ""efficiency"" as it applies to antitrust law. U.S. antitrust law was designed to advance Pareto or economic efficiency, not business or productive efficiency. That misunderstanding leads Judge Bork to propose, in essence, the following Carrollian extended syllogism:Antitrust law advances ""efficiency"" and condemns monopolyConsumer welfare is the goal of antitrust lawConsumer welfare is advanced by lower pricesMonopolists are more ""efficient"" and provide lower pricesto consumers by economies of scaleMonopolists advance consumer welfareMonopoly is ""efficient"" and should be legalLest we forget, John D. Rockefeller lowered the consumer price of kerosene approximately ten-fold while he was crushing smaller competitors. With all due respect to Judge Bork, I don't think that is the type of ""efficiency"" a free, commercial society needs."
4,The barrenness of Tierra del Fuego,"The climate, flora and fauna along with the history of Tierra del Fuego are well presented. The historical context from Magellan to Drake and the Beagle are annotated. But yet is this just plagiarized from other writers?! There is also overuse of nautical jargon.However the historical context is interesting."
4,Understanding history,Text Book history does not tell you the complete story. This book details more information concerning the people involved and the conditions they had to contend with.
4,History and Contemporary Experience,"This is the account of the author's trip to Cape Horn and the surrounding archipelago. Murphy weaves in to this account the history of the Cape Horn region, including some of the experiences of the many sailing ships which rounded the Horn and the interactions between natives and Europeans in the region.The historical segments of this book are quite good, although far more information on Magellan and Drake is given than is needed to tell the history of Cape Horn. But by and large, the historical parts of this book work quite well and are satisfying to the reader. Much less interesting is Murphy's account of his wanderings through the archipelago. His 21st century experience is dull and uninteresting when juxtaposed against the rich history of Cape Horn.In spite of this shortcoming, the book is certainly worth a read by those who are interested in learning more about this intriguing part of the world."
5,Learning more about an (in)famous place!!!,"I recently bought this book because it caught my eye in a bookstore. I have long been a fan of geography and I also love the sea lore surrounding Cape Horn. The Cape is the stuff legends are made of! I (like most people) have only been exposed to Cape Horn from history books and various movies such as ""The Bounty"" and ""Master and Commander"" but this book fills in all the gaps. This book is a fun and entertaining read. Mr. Murphy tells of trip he made to Cape Horn to explore the region with several companions but he also spends a great deal of time discussing the history of the area. He tells the reader about the famous explorations of Magellan, Drake, Darwin and many others who experienced the wrath of the Horn. This book would be great for anyone wanting a fun summer read - plus anyone wanting to know more about one of the neatest places on Earth - Cape Horn."
2,had to replace bearings,product wokred until I had to move my 4 wheeler then the bearings started falling out. I do not know what BAC industries used but they are not good at all. I had to go buy all new wheel coasters with upgraded bearings. works now that I spent an extra $128.00
4,A slice of the career of E. H. Harriman,"This small volume might be considered as an appendix to George Kennan's majestic two-volume biography of E. H. Harriman. It deals with one specific financial manipulation, that of the reorganization of the Chicago & Alton Railroad in 1899-1900. The book shows that there was nothing particularly different about this reorganization among all of the finanical activities surrounding the railroad industry at the time, nor among the activities of E. H. Harriman and his coterie of establishment figures. However, after a falling-out between Harriman and President Theodore Roosevelt in 1906, the Chicago & Alton ""case"" became the basis of Roosevelt's claim that Harriman was an ""undesirable citizen"". Keenan's thesis is that the Interstate Commerce Commission's attack on Harriman was the result of heavy suggestion from the Executive Mansion."
5,Very good,DVD was in new condition and delivered on time. I was always a fan of the show so the quality of service and product was most important.
4,Happy and Hysterical!,"This is a hysterically funny situation comedy that is meant for anyone who wants a good, entertaining series! Many times, morals are included at the end of a few episodes, but they are taught in a way that does not make it seem as though they are being forced down our throats. The plots of the episodes are amusing and fun to watch, and the characters are so unlike any families in reality that they make their audience laugh very easily. True, there are some episodes that are not as fun as others, but ""My Wife and Kids"" is still a great comedy that you should buy on DVD as soon as possible. (There are a few references made to sex, virginity, and teen pregnancy, so it is not a series meant for especially young children, but it is still a good series for people who already understand said topics)."
5,"Excellent review, well balanced view of Energy Issues we face","As an investor who continue to research this area, I found the book very concise and easy to read without the need for a technical background. A good summary of many related subjects in one book. I share the author's views on depletion and the long term advantages of renewables and its required support and adoption. However, I found his imminent doomsday scenario of a 1929 style depression triggered by 'an empty tank' to be without supporting analysis. If this is a 'wake up' call for industry and society to act, I am all for it."
3,"Interesting points, but poorly written and emotional","The topic of peak oil is receiving attention lately, and this book does its part to explain the story. The author's arguements for the early timing of the peak are not wholly convincing, as too much pertinent data is not available to clearly see the picture (as he notes). On the whole the book is written in very colloquial language, and uses an emotional style and language that works against building credibility for the author. Overall there are many interesting points here, but a serious edit is required to bring the quality of the writing up to a standard one would expect when discussing a scientific topic. There are definitely a few nuggets to follow up on if you can slog through the book."
2,Be warned: Notes access limited,"Beware. If you're interested in consulting the notes in this book, don't buy the Kindle edition. The book is set up so that the notes are NOT accessible from/linked to the text, as they are in other Kindle books. You have to keep track of the notes' locations and toggle back and forth from the text: not a very satisfactory process. I checked with the good folks at Kindle Support, just to make sure that the problem was not with my download: the tech told me that the publisher did not provide note links. This was my first encounter with this kind of limitation--hope it's my last!I'd rate the text itself as a 3+, in comparison with other similar books. Some assertions are not documented (even in the inaccessible notes), and the author's zeal sometimes leads to overstatement of the challenges (which are bad enough without making them worse)."
2,"Great Geology, Terrible Economics and Politics","The first third of the book does a great job of estimating carbon fuel production and consumption in the world. The book should have ended there and been published as a technical pamphlet (for which the author appears to qualified to discuss). The remainder of the book contains the authors non-scientific opinions about global warming, Middle Eastern politics and his obvious dislike of the United States. He implies that the world economy is dependent on carbon fuels, not because they are cheap and plentiful, but because the world was duped throughout the 20th century by large multi-national corporations. The author footnotes frequently, citing such notable sources as filmamker Michael Moore or New York Times op-ed pieces as if they were academic journal articles. All that the author says may be correct, but his credability falls short once he steps beyond the rocks."
3,"Not great, but not bad","First off, I bought this mattress at the store for $60, and I really wouldn't pay much more than that. I also bought this for a toddler, since our Sealy Posturpedic (220 coils) got a huge rip in one of the corners after 5 years of use (2 kids and 3 moves). I didn't want to spend a lot on a new mattress.This mattress has 150 coils, and it seemed fairly soft and very springy. There are 2 layers of ""cushioning"", but the cover feels fairly thin. It did fit great in the crib (and within the guidelines for how a mattress should fit), a little smaller than the Posturepedic, but it serves its purpose, and my near 2yo hasn't complained. Not sure if I would use it with a newborn due to the softness, but great for a toddler.If you are buying a mattress for a Newborn, I'd definitely look at the posturepedic. Considering the Amazon prices...$20 isn't that much of a difference between a great mattress and a good one. Just remember more coils=firmer mattress."
4,A very good mattress,"This is the second Sealy Perfect rest I have purchased.It is a good, firm mattress for small babies.Like so may things from Sealy, it is of dependably good quality."
5,EXQUISITE,"I paid over $20 for this CD in Japan and it was worth every penny of it. A great collection of alternative japanese pop. Guaranteed after you listen to it you will get hooked and start buying the individual artist label. This and Sushi 4004 is great but I think this is slightly better. Well worth it. If you like P5, Kahimi Karie and Fantastic Plastic Machine, you will love this CD."
3,Better heard than seen,"Since I bought this DVD on the strength of the reviews given here, I feel obliged to register a dissenting opinion. Florez & Damrau are glorious to listen to, but overall I found the acting stilted & the production to work against the emotion of the music."
1,The only good thing about this DVD...,"... is that you can trade it in and get some of your money back to buy a better production. (In my case, the one with Leo Nucci)."
3,"Good listening, not so good viewing","I thought the singing and acting were excellent. I did not care for the set, and the direction of the action.It was very Verdi in sound, but not in viewing."
1,NUDITY warning,"While the singing is wonderful, and the setting is more modern, I can do without the topless nudity. Productions like this make it extremely difficult to introduce opera to younger people without having to do A LOT of explaining, thus detracting from the beauty of the music and drama."
4,Rigoletto,"Music, sets and costumes were great. I loved it. This is my second recording of this opera; both are excellent."
4,Dino Dig a success,"We purchased this toy for our Grandson, he was overjoyed at the movement of each dinosaur.Don't know how well the moving parts will stay on, but was received well."
5,birthday present,This was a birthday present. I am fully satisfied with this product. The gift recipent is also satisfied with this gift.
1,"Same Product - Multiple Names , different Prices",This Product Magnetism DVD is available with another name Physical Science in Action: Magnetism DVD - Ensure the prices before you buy the cheaper one
4,Gorgeous,"This rather long 5 song EP (it clocks in at over 40 minutes) is quite remarkable. Probably my favorite thing I've listened to recently. It's very serene, very earthy folk music, but with an element I can't put my finger on. The songs all flow together, and form song cycles and movements that are quite beautiful. Unlike most folk music, it really comes across as a group effort, rather than a singer/songwriter type album. 4/5 Stars."
2,a train wreck,"What a pretentious, overblown waste of my time. This album is a massive mistake. Not a single note did I enjoy.Don't get me wrong, I fully enjoy ""Glow Part 2"" and ""It Was Hot"", two albums with catchy, unpredictable arrangements and searching, inspired lyrics. Get these two.But this?? Phil just reached too far, a concept album about the whole universe, or whatever the hyped press releases try to sell you with. Listen to those samples, and the glacial nothingness and muttered syllables just go on ad nauseum. I very graciously give it two stars just to acknowledge all the effort that must have went into the production, all of it supremely misguided."
1,Vanity Fair Bra Disappointed,"This was a nice bra but the sizing was off, If I hadnt have removed the tags before trying it on I would have returned them so I donated them to salavage army. If ordered order a cup size smaller than normal"
5,A very good movie!,"This movie is a true story about 'The Land Of The Free', America and how the Indian people were treated when Europeans came to that land. Real people tell their story how as children they were taken from their family and taught to be christian. This is a similar stort to the abolriginal people of Australia. Indiginous people world wide have received a rough deal. Touching in its truth and honesty.Another tale all need to watch and learn from. Heartbraking in its honesty."
5,One of My Favorite Animorphs books,"In this book Rachel is accidently divided into the two different sides of her personality-sweet, timid, and strategizing Nice Rachel, and violent, short tempered, and reckless Mean Rachel. The timing couldn't be worse as her friends have a big emergency on hand and neither Rachel is fit for any sort of fight, (Nice Rachel is practically afraid of her own shadow and over analizes every step of everything and Mean Rachel is out of control, not to mention incapable of stealth or planning). So while facing a huge emergency the Animorphs have to find a way to get the two personalities to mix into the original Rachel. Mean Rachel may be a little dark for the intended audience, but overall the book is great as it shows that even Rachel who puts up a fearless and brave front, has a vulnerable side and fears like everyone else. You don't often see the ""evil-twin"" scenario where the ""twin"" is actually part of the same person and Applegate did well presenting this situation."
5,"Beautiful! Excellent work, K.A. Applegate!","What a masterpiece! I LOVE K.A. Applegate's writing! Rachel is SSSSOOOOO cool! She's my idol! What a warrior! If you loved books number 2, 7, 12, 17, 22, and 27 you'll go crazy when you read this one! Outstanding literature! A must-have for your Animorphs collection!"
2,Worst One,"This is literally the worst issue of Animrophs ever made. It's annoying, makes an interesting character into a pointless good-evil-clone caricature, and in generally goes nowhere and does nothing. Skip it."
2,Every series has one...,"Every fantasy/sci-fi series at least. Ahh, my old friend the split-personality-into-extremes plot. Can we all spell: scraping the barrel? However, it is better than the ""return of a character everyone thought was dead/far away"" storyline that seems to be recurring..."
5,Slam Me,Alexis P. Suter sung on one of the best house songs ever!!!!!!!!!! Slam Me....4 to the bar.I wish they put that on c.d. Alexis has one of the best voices in the industry.Definitely check her out.
5,Sleeping well now,This is an excellent product. Very surprised! The time release must be working. Both my husband and I swear by this. No trouble with bad dreams or waking up groggy.Keep Solanova Melatonin on your list of items to check out!
4,Outstanding Scholarly Review of the Political Period Just Before the US Civil War,"I discovered this work while reviewing some new material on A. Lincoln and the Civil War, which are my real interest. I am amazed at how detailed and clearly the author has sifted through the period covered. His insight and attention to detail have provided a great deal to consider. My knowledge and understanding of this period has risen tremendously and I only regret that I didn't ""discover"" these books much earlier."
2,Other books by Pella are better,"I enjoyed portions of this book but was uncomfortable with the sensuality and the fact that God seemed so impersonal to them even after their conversions. Their conversions didn't seem genuine to me and afterwards everything worked out conviently the way they wanted, almost condoning their sin of adultery. I expected more from a Christian writer.I have thoroughly enjoyed other books by this author and highly recommend them (Russians, Stonewyck). Disappointed with this one."
2,Not one of my favs,"I really didn't like this book. I didn't feel there was much of a religious background in it and I bought it at a Christian Bookstore! I wasn't left wanted to read more by this author which was dissapointing. I may try another book by the same author but I will get it from the library instead of paying for it this time. I don't even want to let anyone borrow this book after reading it, I just feel that it wasn't good at all......the story wasn't about God at all."
3,Competetive Price,"These bulbs have never lasted more than 6 months. That being said, the price is competetive for AQUA original equipment. It came within a couple of days and was extremely well packaged so I don't begrudge the shipping charge."
2,NOT Aqua Brand UV Lights,"The lights I received are NOT Aqua brand UV lights. I would have returned these Chinese made lights but I figured I would give them a try. If I find they are crap, I will make sure to let everyone know.UPDATE:August 3, 2012 - So far so good. They seem to be performing as well as the brand name ones. They have been running for about a month now. Will know at the end of the season when I remove them to see how they stood up."
4,bizzare and funny conclusion of a 3 part series,"Web of Defeat(or de-feet) is the third book in Lionel Fenn's Tales of the White Duck. It was one of the first humorous fantasy stories I ever read and therefore holds a special place in my heart. It was the first time I spent more time laughing while reading fantasy and learned that even adventures can be funny. This is the conclusion of a 3 book series that started with Agnes Day. It is the story of a white duck and a drunk professional football player, if I told anymore than that it would ruin the plot. If you can find this book, grab it. Unfortunately, I have lost my copies of this series and would enjoy reading them again"
2,"Little of this is Howard, the rest is Drake; buyer beware","there are only two complete Howard stories in this volume, with one complete Drake story, one uncompleted Howard story completed by Drake, and an unfinished Howard story with completed synopsis. I've got nothing particular against Drake, but in this genre he is an inferior writer, and there is nothing in the information given about this book by Amazon to make clear how little of it is Howard. Unless you read the intro, and a small blurb in the front cover itself, you won't know how little of this is Howard. The book should have been listed as written by David Drake, Robert E Howard, and edited by Glenn Lord. Yes, it's not expensive, but here you get what you pay for. Buyer beware, and shame on Baen for whoring on Howard's work without disclosing the true content of a volume."
3,"The Howard is good, the Drake is NOT","Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against Drake. Later on in his career, he wrote some good fantasy. Truth is though, ""The Land Towards Sunset"" by Drake at the beginning of this collection, is TERRIBLE. The tales later in the book such as ""Tigers of The Sea"", are true Howard stories and though not all finished, will be very interesting to his fans. However, before you buy this just make sure you understand that a full THIRD of this book is not by Robert E. Howard, and little of what he did write is finished. If you're not a big follower of Howard or pulp fiction, you may be disapointed."
3,More & More,Bought this only for More and More...love that song...pretty much the only good song...he just came out with a compilation on his website...
5,Ten stars!...This is the Bible!,"If you can only buy one book on composition of Outdoor Painting, this is the one. The original book, published in 1941, has seen several editions and goes in and out of print. Although Amazon often shows that it is out of print, call the publisher directly. They have plenty of brand new copies in the latest editions. The book, itself, is not large, only 6x9 or so. And it mostly consists of WORDS! But it is one of the most succinct books on composition I have ever read. Each paragraph, each sentence is packed with information and advice. There are some simple line drawings which help the viewer and provide the basics for compositional outlines. Also, the newer editions have some very fine color samples of Mr. Paynes work in the back of the book, as well as several addenda by his daughter. If you are an outdoor painter, you could read this book every day for the rest of your life and still find something new to think about or try."
1,Old perfume!,This perfume has lost its sent all the way. All you can smell is alcohol. DON'T waste your money on it. It has lost its shelf life and the seller should include that info with the product!! Awful smell... cant say it enough!!!
3,Could have been better,"This book was well written and had enough suspense and romance, but I had a problem with the heroine being raped and the writer more or less ignoring that issue. I think there should have been some type of justice done for her. The rape took alot of the enjoyment from the book for me because of the lack of justice."
5,Had trouble putting it down,"I have become an avid JoAnn Ross fan. I love the way she sets up the characters and interweaves their stories into the plot line of her books. She makes her characters believable and the situations realistic. Unlike her book Southern Comforts, the ending of Legacy of Lies ties it all together nicely."
2,Product description does not describe this book,"I bought this book after reading the product description. It sounded interesting. Well, I'm currently reading this book & it has absolutely nothing to do with the description. More like an elaborate soap opera. The characters mentioned in the product description do not exist in this book."
3,55 gallons of water weighs 459.25 lbs...,Why would you buy a 55 gallon drum dolly that is rated at 400lbs?water weighs 8.35 lbs per gallon X 55 gallons = 459.25 lbs plus weight of the drum...Makes no sense unless you only fill your 55 gallon drums with 47.9 gallons of water...then you are at design rate maximum... Huh?
3,Beer Beer Beer Beer. Oh and a little cheese.,"This book is only just the right side of middling. The cheese comes in the form of the guest appearance of the legendary 'White Dwarf', after which Games Workshops magazine is named. The writing is okay, but not spectacular, it does however move along at a reasonable clip. There are many better Warhammer novels. If you have any interest in the Dwarf elements of the Warhammer world, then I will award this 4 stars rather than 3, because you will be very happy with this book. Oh and it does involve a brewery Who would have thought beer and beardlings. Black Library had Nick Kyme write some more warhammer Dwarf oriented books, 'Oathbreaker' and 'Honourkeeper'"
3,"An easy read, somewhat entertaining","This book made for an easy read, but do not expect to be enthralled by it. The best part of the book are the scenes of every day life in a Dwarven hold and the drunken revelry. The book is worth the purchase price."
2,this book,"MATT CHRISTOPHER: FOOTBALL NIGHTMARE was an interesting book. It shows Keith Stedman life and his life nightmare. Keith Stedman is a hero on the team, and his little sister really looks up to him, his family always encouraged and proud of him. Even though he is an awesome player on the team he drops a winning pass and just that little thing wants him to quit. That is when the story falls apart. His little sister and family very disappointed but still knows it is his decision. He gets help from everyone and everything ends up getting fixed...you will have to read the book to know what all happens."
2,Ryan's Review,"Football Nightmare is about a kid who drops a pass and he doesn't want to play anymore because of that incomplete pass. So everyone always nags him and begs him to play, and he almost loses a couple of friends. He always runs into his coach and his coach always asks him to play. No matter what anyone says, he still does not want to play. In my opinion, it is not good, and I don't recommend this to anybody. There was not enough football in it so if you are looking for a football book, this is not cool, sporty, fun, or good it's BAD--trust me you will not like it. Well, I read it because I thought it was mainly about football, but it wasn't."
2,Disappointing game,"We love many other vsmile and vflash games. BUT, this one gets boring pretty quickly. The games don't have much to them. You can change lightning mc queen's colors and decals. My son was bored of doing that quickly. Then, you can race him around and answer math questions, but overall, we were disappointed in this game. There aren't that many activities, the loading time between each sequence is long, and the games are kind of, well, boring to be honest!"
2,disappeared,"Well, I ordered and they never arrived. I contacted the seller and they said it was listed as having been delivered USPS and I should ask my postal carrier. I did. He said he had no record of it. I still have no bobby pins. Not sure what happened, I've never had mail lost before. Maybe this isn't typical for this product, but it's what happened to me."
2,Pot luck,"The idea of buying this doll over the internet is great, but since each one is one of a kind you are taking a chance by purchasing it sight unseen.I recently ordered one for my daughter for Christmas and got the ugliest one possible. She had a small patch of hair on top of her head, and she was wearing a daisy duke halter top and a short wrap skirt, a tacky outfit for a baby first of all and she had no shoes looked like a country bumpkin. Needless to say I sent her back and went to the store and picked one out myself.So if you don't mind taking your chances then go for it."
4,Lessons culled from political lore,"If you like politics, especially political lore, then you probably will like this book. Don't worry about a liberal or conservative slant, this book is about how to win, whichever side of the aisle you are on. The principles that Matthew's has assembled are informative, however, I found I was most interested simply in the campfire tales of political manuevering. However, I I would have liked more documentation and attribution to support the stories that Matthews recounts. Bottom line: a fun, easy read for anyone from the political neophyte to a full-fledged political junkie."
5,very good delivery,"the parcel came in good condition im very happy with it. the book wasn't terrible such as ripped or torn. the book looked brand new which i was very pleased about. therefore, ordering from amazon i garantee that you will not be disappointed."
1,Chris Matthews Doesn't Know the Game or Rules,"As usual, Chris Matthews misleads and this book is typical. He no more knows the rules of politics except the nasty ones where he lies to his viewing and reading public to mislead them. And the book is BORING! IT drags. This book was pure drivel and I wouldn't waste my time buying it. There are far better commentators, talking heads, and writers who can give you the rules of politics - don't follow this tripe that he spews. I wasted my money on this supposed expert who knows the game - don't waste yours!"
1,More Blah Blah from the Dorkball talking head,"If you want to completely waste your time by reading a monumentally unimportant book,then you can read this garbage.This guy thinks he knows the game,how its played,etc.He is actually a big part of the dumbing down and brainwashing of America.That is his game and he does it in the most dorky,chicken#%&! way humanly possible.If you want to know how the game is played,check out books by people who will give you the truth behind the show,not by these lame keepers of the lies like Dorkball here.The main Lie is 911.Look into it.Chris is nothing but an undeserving high paid dose of Dork!"
2,HOW POLITIC IS PLAYED,"This was a new book, but the pages were all yellowed. It looked as though it had been placed in a damp cellar for years. I could not help but to be disappointed, since this was to have been a gift.The other Chris Matthews book that I purchased (Kennedy) was in excellent condition."
4,good read.,"I actually ordered this for my little brother as our original copy was destroyed. This book gave me a good bit of insight into the workings of political system from a politician's perspective. I also found some very good principles of psychology in general, such as ""People don't mind being used, but they hate being taken for granted"" paraphrase)."
4,Christopher Matthews is a Master of Politics,"For political fanatics or for outsiders, this book just tells the tricks of the trade. It shows that reguardless of a politicians popularity, they can reach the top. From JFK's telivised debate to Reagan's termination of communism, Matthews shows the largest scandals such as ""WaterGate"" and small as Alber Gore, Sr.'s familiarity of the salons in Georgetown. Matthews gives advice to future politicians and reveals the right and wrong of politics. It's the survival of the fittest in politics. He shows how and when to use these political strategies unlike some of LBJ's foul ups. Great Book and recomended to all!"
5,Recommended by a McCain strategist,"I took a class on political strategy with a key aide on the John McCain campaign. Of the reading he assigned, the one book he said we MUST read was Hardball. This book is a classic political strategy manual. It is the best of its kind, it is timeless. A must read for anyone who wants to understand or be involved in the political world, and that comes not just from myself, but from one who ""knows the game."""
3,Kindle Pricing?,"This is more of a criticism of Amazon than the book. $13.00 for Kindle pricing but less than $6 for paperback?! With pricing like this, Amazon should make a new category of the additional money it costs instead of how much you could save."
3,useful,"this is a useful, practical account of how to succeed in politics.Matthews concentrates on the practical, than the theoretical.Overall, the advice is could be summarised as follows. Concentrate on the common denominator, forget the big picture, and focus on delivery to your constituents.While all that has its usefulness, and probably explains why some politicians can overstay their welcome, it ignores the, what should be important - that is the 'vision thing'. What place does the big picture have if politics is left to only feeding re-election, and not doing anything important.A chicken and the egg question, I know. That's a hardball question"
4,As good a place as any to start.,"If you only know Scott Walker via The Walker Brothers and ""The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore,"" you're in for a surprise (and a treat) here. Much more accessible, but not necessarily better, than ""Tilt,"" his 1995 release. Unusual string arrangements, sorta like Brian Ferry-on-quaaludes vocals and, well, different, songs and arrangements make this CD well worth hearing."
5,Anybody remember Billy Ocean?,"Before TILT & THE DRIFT there was CLIMATE OF HUNTER. Just as strange, just as eerie, it's an essential chapter in a 30+ year career that could be called anything but prolific.As others have cited CLIMATE has the production values of Roxy's Music's AVALON cut with the bleak, obtuse lyricism, that has become Walker's trademark. It's all capped off with a haunting coda of Tennessee Williams', ""Blanket Roll Blues"". The song Brando crooned in THE FUGITIVE KIND.If that's not incentive enough, CLIMATE also features MTV One Hit Wonder Boy, Billy Ocean harmonizing on ""Track 3"". Other contributors include Mark's Knopfler & Isham.Sprawling & cinematic,lines like,""The shadow of the son made the son a shadow"", seem more concerned at creating atmosphere than establishing any narrative. Call it ""deep"", pretentious, or self-indulgent, Walker's influence is undeniable. Bowie, The Divine Comedy, Bjork & Portishead are just a few."
5,Informative and concise,"This book starts where field guides leave off. If you're interested in learning about an animal's habitat, behavior, and distribution in the New Enland region, then this book is indispensible. A great study tool for the wildlife enthusiast who wants to go beyond the condensed text of picture field guides. Note: this book assumes that you are familiar with the animals' physical appearance, so if you're not, you'll need a good regional field guide as companion book."
5,WOW! This is the hottest Jazz I've ever listened to!,"Before I was allowed to borrow this CD, I was not a Jazz listener. I loved to play Jazz trombone, but i was more of a popular music listener. Man did this CD change my life. I now am a huge fan of the Mingus Big Band and hot Jazz. No matter what kind of music you listen to, buy this CD and turn it to number 5 ""Fables of Faubus."""
2,I can't read it,"This is an OK book, and it comes with a poster, too. However, it's in Japanese, so I can't understand any of it. It does include a number of Gundam designs for some shows like Gundam Wing, but not all the shows. The designs are neat to look at, as it shows the different versions of each suit before reaching the final version. So unless you want to explore a little in the number of Gundam suits, don't bother."
5,"The ONLY thing wrong here is the spelling...""Odessey""!","O.K., nothing terribly witty or mindbendingly profound here. The others have said what had to be said. Virtually every track will have you marveling at the Zombies ability to play WITH music. Listening to this CD refreshed memories of thought and feeling that I thought were forever lost. ""Brief Candles,"" ""Smokey Day"", and ""Walking in the Sun"" will renew your innocence... and, YES, that feeling just might provoke a tear or two. One of the top 5 albums of all time? It just might be. Just close your eyes and listen."
4,"Fantastic music, fantastic sleeve","If you like Beach Boys and want to discover a truly hidden gem of the end sixties, beginning seventies than you really have to listen to this one, a combi of their master album and never before released follow up material. As a bonus a wonderful digipack with very psychedelic sleeve-design."
5,exciting and mournful at the same time,"you can feel the group were bummed that they knew their music hadnt beenreceived well enough (criminally) for future releases to be supported,so this music feels like a going-away party..like any going away party,its bittersweet.the sweet parts, however, are heart-wrenching.without using too many words, o&o; is, well, an amazing recording.r.i.y.l. the beatles, love, hollies, turtles, raspberries, etc.5 stars."
3,Odessey & Oracle CD,Musics great but I thought the CD would have a jewel case or or something other that a perfectly flat sleeve to house the CD. Not too big of a deal but it won't be easy to find within my CD collection. Very cheap packaging.
4,A real gem,"This album sat forgotten amoungst my vinyl collection until I heard an interview with Rod Argent and Colin Blunstone on NPR. Afterwards, I pulled out the record but it was too badly damaged from years of overuse. Listening again reminds me why I played it so often - it is a real gem from the 60s."
3,"Historically significant, if hopelessly dated.","The final Zombies album is important in rock history. You should hear it. However, the whole album, until the final song, is VERY dated stylistically. The tracks have a delightful, loopy, trippy energy, and shift beats and moods randomly within a track. But in the post-Spinal Tap era, it's hard not to chuckle, as most of them sound like Tap's ""Listen To The Flower People"", without the comedy. Then, at the last minute, comes TIME OF THE SEASON, which lands on the tail end of this record like a clean, snappy, well produced hook-fest. It seems to come from a different world than the rest of the album. You are finally reminded that Argent and Blunstone could write a thrilling, smashing pop song. Unfortunately, you have to wade through the rest of the album to get there."
2,Genealogy - Ellyson Line,The description of the book was not clear about who was covered.So I took a chance and it turned out to be useless to me. Igained no information.
2,Helps beginners,This book covers all fundamentals of java programming.I needed more advanced topics and examples in OOP and threading using java
1,Bad book.,"This book is good from a teaching perspective, but the examples are confusing and the explanations are also somewhat lacking. The book is decent for classes on java, but much more personal success can be found with other books. Oh yeah, POGO is a real nation. We call ourselves Pogopians."
4,4th edition excellent,"All of the reviews I have read were for previous editions. I usethis for my class text, and students have been very pleased. Itis easy to teach from, with good exercises (most), and the 4thedition has cleaned up errors mentioned in earlier reviews. Iuse it for a beginning and intermediate University level class.The text is managable and not as verbose at Eckel or as simpletonas Dietel. Better explainations than the Nutshells which arealso good books. Covers topics often left out in intro books,Threads, Sockets and Networking.This is the fifth text I have used since I started teachingJava classes, and definitely best so far (but get the 4th ed!)"
1,HORRIBLE BOOK,"This is a horrible book. The examples have little to do with the illustrated point, involve complex mathematics, and most often don't help you at all. It seems like Liang is leaving you at constant cliff hangers because it takes hours of work and repeated readings to understand any of the complex chapters. Although the book says it identifies its customers as people with no java experience, Liang wrote it as if you DID understand everything that was in the book already. The explanations are so bad you don't understand much. OH yes, Figi is a country. We all ourselves the Figi-people."
3,Nice,"This holiday CD is very nice for celebrating the season. A nice variety of songs performed in a soulful, R&B style."
1,I dont get it?,The light on this thing is so dim I cant believe they have the nerve to make it this way. Its ridiculous. You would think a name like Revlon would have some standards. I guess they just slapped their name on it without even bothering to try it out. I think it looks cool as far as wall mirrors go - but its too heavy to buy just for looks. Id rather have a light weight mirror without a light to hang on the wall than a heavy one with a light thats no good.
4,Present for wife,"My wife is very happy with her mirror. She wanted one after using one on vacation. The price is best I found. Only draw backs I found were the switch for the light is loud and stiff. (Can't turn on and off quietly) and not made to hide wiring if you want to direct wire it like I did to the GFI outlet near sink. But again those are my draw backs, my wife is very happy with it."
5,so glad i got it,"I previously had a lighted make-up mirror that stood on my bathroom counter. This is so much better, leaving my counters free and clear. It is easy to install; just hang it on the wall and plug it in. It definitely helps see all the details that aging eyes need help with, be it plucking eyebrows or putting on makeup."
3,Review of Revlon,We found that the 7X was too much magification coupled with the 8 inch diameter you cannot see your whole face. We are exchanging it for a larger 10 inch with 5X magnification.
2,Didn't have enough light,I was disappointed with this product and plan on returning it. The light on the mirror was weaker than the bathroom lighting. You get what you paid for.
2,Not Enough Light,"The mirror is quite adequate as far as the style, installation, and ease of use are concerned. However, the light output is quite bad. As my wife and I get older, more light is needed to see things clearly. In my opinion, it fails as a ""lighted"" mirror."
4,Deep!,"Fantastic book for those curious about the nature of reality.I love all the diagrams and detailed descriptions. I just wish the author had gone into more detail regarding quantum physics. Also, he convincingly describes an 'attractive' force working within the relational matrix, but leaves us hanging on 'repulsive' forces."
3,Unified Reality,"As for Kaufman's book, I'd rather sit under the Boa tree. Can someone step up to the plate here? He goes on and on and on with words and diagrams to explain what surely must be a simple message for everyone to understand. There is a book called ""The Book: On the Taboo of Knowing Who You Are"" by Alan Watts (1966) that in three pages (14, 15, 16) describes (as if to children) how the uiverse came into being and since he refers to the game of ""hide and seek"" I would have thought Mr. Kaufman would have acknowledged Mr. Watts' contribution to his own description of ""hide and seek"". Mr. Kaufman makes an admirable attempt, but please! simplify, simplify, simplify. The answer must be palatable for everyone to understand...so who will usher forth the message for the masses? Batter on deck?"
3,heavy truckin,This just might be TOE???My brain-mind burns 1000 kalories per.hour reading this.This book must be STUDIED. So far have found no conflict with presently tentatively held belief systems.
4,"A fun, entertaining children's book!!","This book is so fun to look at. The split pages make it delightful to all ages. I love it and I don't even have all the pages! That is why I am looking for it! As a teacher, I recognize the value of this book - this could entertain my students for a while!"
3,Transformers,"The product was almost exactly what I was expecting. The car transformation wasn't as solid as I would have liked, the back wheels float freely, but for the price, it was fine."
5,Best Bushido To Come!,"This is one of the best busido's ive ever bought, and it was deffinetly worth the money , every fight was fast paced, everyfight had a good ending, there was no BORING fights, and its a tournament which makes it that much better! This is a must buy if u are a pride fan and u like the smaller fighters Yves Edwards puts on a great showing, so does Jenz Pulver and Phil Baroni, now with Chuck lidell losing his title to Quinton Jackson in UFC and he has to Fight the New Pride Middleweight and Welterweight Champ thats right he beat Wanderlia Silvia, Dan henderson! So the fight world is now gonna be insane, pride fighters will be fighting ufc fighters and there will be some of the best dream matches we have waited for! Anyway this bushido is the bomb deffiently buy it if u a MMA fan of fast paced fights not slow bs!"
5,One of the best...,"I wont go into great depth about the fights, as that has been done. I own almost every PRIDE event, have seen the vast majority of UFC fights, but this is probably my top to bottom, all time favorite event. About every fight was excellent, w/many great finishes. Would recommend this to any MMA fan."
2,"Poor Quality, Arrived with a hole in them","Granted, I didn't pay much for these, so perhaps for the price they were fine. But they are made of scraps of leather, and ours arrived with a hole in one of the gloves. We decided to ship it back and get a refund."
4,Viva Reform School Girls,"I saw this movie back in the 80s,when i was a mere 20 years.Now at 40 and a 15 year old girl later.I picked a copy up,And watched it with my daughter.She looked at me like i was crazy during the first five minutes.It did not take long before she was rooting on wendy o williams.Now it is her new found favorite movie.AAAHHH the decadent 80s.pick this one up,and show your kids what your guilty pleasures are.they will love you for it."
4,America's finest cinematic display of Women in Prison films.,"If you are reading reviews for Reform School Girls, you may have an understanding the attraction for Women in Prison films, so click ""add to cart"" and buy it ASAP, it is definately worth it.Reform School Girls is a fantastic display of girl violence, ultra-hammy acting and gratuitous T and A. All staples of WIP films apply, girl fights, strip searches, a mean kitten stomping warden, pillow fights, riots, and fire hosing. I saw this years ago on USA Up All Night, it resonated within my soul and one day I was fortunate to find a copy.Punk rock legend Wendy O. Williams plays one of the main villians ""Charlie"" vs the good girls and keeps the camp coming with dialog such as:Warden Edna: Your a s*** stain on the panties of life.Charlie: You should know you lick em every night.Rumor has it, the Amercian Film Institute is putting this on the top 100 films of all time. Must see for the whole family."
4,FOUR STARTS FOR WENDY O,"What's not to like in a women-behind-bars flick that stars sexy Sybil Danning and rocker Wendy O. Williams with songs by Etta James? You read that correctly.The story, such as it is, follows the learning curve of innocent Linda Carol as she enters the hellhole known as Pridemore Juvenile Facility For Girls where, to quote the poster, ""chaos and desire collide in an orgy of nakedrage.""Wendy O. Williams is pretty near unforgettable as the scary, hardened teen leader of a gang of lust-crazed lesbians. Pat Ast is dead-on as a brutal prison matron. Tom DeSimone (The Concrete Jungle) directed from his own screenplay. The funny commentary track is a bizarre conversation with DeSimone and humorist Martin Lewis.This movie is even better than the admittedly terrific retro poster. And Wendy O sings her tight, skinny a*s off."
3,A definite women prison of the 80's!,"At first, this movie was very forced and contrived, but cameo actress and Andy Warhol film graduate, Pat Ast,(who I first spotted in a Motley Crue video ""Smokin' in the Boys Room""; whose character in the movie is very similar), really gets the film off the ground with her terrifying performance that is cold and evil! It also features rocker Wendy O' Williams who committed suicide years later as a lesbian tormenting her cell mates. Linda Carol plays an innocent teenager sent to prison, Sybil Danning from the motion picture ""Chained Heat"" plays a bitchy warden. The movie heats up towards the end, which all action fans would enjoy if they start falling asleep half way through. I liked this movie, the only thing I didn't like about this is when Pat Ast crushes a kitten to death - Yuck!!! Linda Carol starred in an awful, soft- core porn dud ""Carnal Crimes"", which went straight to video; she was better in this one."
5,KEEP YOUR HANDS ABOVE THE SHEETS LADIES!!!!,"I had seen this film years ago when my older sister and her friend had hired it.I hadn't seen this for years and only remembered a few scenes from the film, so I decided to buy it to see again.I love it!If you understand that it's a spoof of women in Prison movies and not to be taken too seriously, then I think you'll enjoy the film better. It's fun and funny in many places.Lead Linda Carol is impressive. I like her alot, and really enjoyed her as the lead. Where is she today?I wish she was working more. I miss her!Wendy O' Williams is awesome in this film. She's tough and will take no crap from nobody.This film has it's own special place in my heart.If you enjoy Women in prison movies then you should definitely check this out."
5,great update from a classic prison flick,"This film, was actually a remake of the film ""Caged"" starring Eleanor Parker and Agnes Moorehead, made in the 50's. This film was remade with a 80's rock and roll feel. The ""lets play the name game"" scene is an exact duplicate of ""c'mon you tramps line up for count"" where the girls get off their bunk beds, stand in line and recite their name. The women in the 50's version wore drab prison garb, the new version the women are wearing sexy undergarments! When you compare the two matrons of each movie, they could pass for sisters!!! Both films have a prison riot because of a cat that was smuggled into the prison. Wendy O. Williams was great, understand she was tragically killed in a bike accident just about 6 months after this film was made. Sybil Danning who played the warden, who is a several prison made movie woman herself, playing in great films like Caged Heat. This is a good DVD and a camp remake of a classic prison film."
3,great cheese movie wendy o. is at her prime.,"this is an all time classic B and definately a must have for WENDY O fans. however, be aware that video is recorded in EP speed which lowers quality."
4,Guilty pleasure,"Girl on girl action, sadistic prison matrons, the late great Wendy O....who could ask for more! We love you Pat Ast!"
1,Cheezy and pathetic but you have to watch it.,"A pathetic attempt at a sexplotation move starring the now deceased Wendy Orleans Williams. Wendy the former lead singer of the 70's and 80's Punk band, the Plasmatics is a gruff mid forties woman attempting to play an 18 year old lesbian. Lots of skin and some violence. I reccomend it totaly for it cheese factor and the fact that Wendy sings a few of her best songs. END"
4,Insert question for anyone who bought this movie new.,Not reviewing the movie but wanted to know if anyone who bought this movie new got a free movie poster inside with the DVD. I sold this movie and someone cried to me about not including a poster with it. I never got one and I bought it straight from amazon prime.
3,Sublime Trash,"You won't be philosophical after watching this movie. In fact, there isn't much you will be after watching this movie. It's pure escapism. For a way to waste an hour or so, though, this is pretty good. The story is weak, the acting is not of Oscar caliber and the writing isn't wonderful, either. The story line is simple, though, and if you are a guy, the women are at least moderately attractive, and sometimes nude. I would not call this a movie for the ladies, though. At least not heterosexual ladies,"
2,This is a bad movie but WENDY O ROCKS!!!,"Reform School Girls is a bad 80s movie full of male fantasy, implied rape, a really bad hetero sex scene, and lots of girl vs. girl violence. But Wendy O (who was 36 at the time) kicks some serious butt! She did her own crazy bus stunt in the end! This movie is a deffinite must see for anyone who loves Wendy! END"
1,Reform School,Was not impressed with video as a womens prison it did not come out to what I thought a grotty prison officer with a unimpressed prison warden if I had a option I would have asked for my money back on this movie !!
1,Sucker Punched,"Boy do I feel like chump. I bought this DVD based on the reviews here and because of it's overall 4 star rating. Holy Crap was I ever sucker punched in the back of the head by this wretched little pile-o-lizard spittleI love cult films and I also love films that are so bad they are good etc. and I guess that's the main reason why I fell for these reviews hook, line & sTinker!I could not even find it in my heart to finish this movie after about an hour I couldn't take it no more, so back in the case and into the garbage disposal crunch crunch Bye Bye. Aaaarrrggghh one can only wait so long for something/anything of interest to happen or be said.Please don't end up a chump like me and stay away from this one, because I can assure you the people who wrote these great reviews are not going to get together, take a collection and give you you're money back. Bitter? You bet."
1,Disappionted,"I bought this movie thinking I would see lesbian sex (because I like that) but I was disappointed-there were a few pretty women, but I saw NO good sex senes and a stupid story. I think this movie was a waste of my money."
5,GOOD UN-WHOLESOME FUN....,"This is a WAY-Y-Y over-the-top send-up of girls-in-prison movies. Perfectly cast, it's a comic book on film and great fun to watch. Of course, the scene stealers are Warhol alumni Pat Ast as the matron Edna and the Plasmatics' Wendy O.Williams as ""Charlie"". Both of these ladies are gone now but their contributions live on in this cult classic. Fast paced and with a great soundtrack, you can watch this over and over and still pick up stuff every time. Unfortunately, there is too much female nudity (for a change) that distracts rather than titillates but this is still a rocking movie. The climax is a kicker as well. Good treatment from the folks at Anchor Bay."
4,"I'LL SEE YOU IN HELL, EDNA!!!","Some friends and I rented this movie because it looked like trashy fun, and it is. If you like cheap movies that make fun of a genre as well as themselves, this is the flick for you. Acting? Variable. Plot? Predictable. Fun? Hell, yes! And C'mon -- it has WENDY O. WILLIAMS; how can you NOT love this movie?!?!? Get your chick friends together, bring out the junk food, and have fun watching and screaming at this highly entertaining fluff."
4,PUNKS,"This isn't the best kids movie out there, but its not too bad. Its not just for the little kids this time since it is about young teens. Of coarse it has that red headed boy thats in like every single kids movie, hes kinda weird, anyway theres only 2 cute boys in this one! anyway gotta go 4 now!"
1,Not Patrik Ian Polk's film,"If you type in Patrik Ian Polk's name on Amazon this film comes up. This is NOT Patrik Ian Polk's film of the same name which as of this date has not yet been released on DVD. Amazon should correct the listing, but in the meantime, be aware this is not director Polk's film. The one star is for the mistaken listing, not for this film which I have never seen."
3,Kids liked it,Seems like a pretty dumb movie to me but my younger brother and sister love this movie. They spent years laughing and quoting this movie.
4,Cool,"This is one ofmy favorite disney channel movies! When it first came out I couldn't get enough of it. Now that it's on DVD Ican watch it whenever I want.Also, Jessical Alba is great in this movie. That's the main reason why I love it so much!"
5,Perfect for a curious 9 year old,"This was a perfect gift for my 9 year old grandson. He revels in knowing a lot of ""stuff"" and all the information contained in this book provides fodder for his fertile young mind."
2,Jade earrings,"A present for my wife, she complained they were too large for the holes in her ears, but kept them."
5,Nice toothpick holder,"It's three and one quarter inches long, three eighths in diameter not counting the pocket clip, and will hold 7 or 8 round toothpicks without being too tight to get stuck.Since I am used to carrying other things in my pants pockets, this toothpick holder is not a problem for me. It can be clipped on a shirt pocket as well."
2,False advertising,"This is not 100% stainless. The outer tube is stainless. The inner tube is plastic. The threaded insert is chrome plated brass. The cap is chrome plated brass. The chrome plating was very poorly done, as it came off within two days of it being in my pocket. It is thin and flakes off with little effort. Being that they lied about the brass I doubt if the stainless truly is food grade. I would also like to know what the plastic insert is made of. There are food grade and non-food grade plastics.BE SURE TO WASH IT BEFORE YOU USE IT. The cap still had cutting oil in it.This tube holds exactly 8 round tooth picks. Plenty if you ask me.This tube is very sturdy and very well constructed. It serves it's job very well. Despite the false advertising and lousy chrome plating it does the job very well. I am still happy to have it all the same."
4,good product,"does what it says, cleans easily, carry it around in my backpack, but could be a sport coat or purse item. money well spent. bought two for gifts."
5,Great Product,"This item is a great compact and nice tool to carry around. It is an attractive case. I looked around locally to determine if I could purchase a similar product, but one could not be located.I am glad I ordered this; I got one for my mother too, as she always seems to have a need for something like this when she is out and about; and it always drove her crazy when she needed a toothpick but couldn't locate one."
5,Stainless Steel toothpick holder,"Received today thru Fedex-post office. Supposed to be delivered on the 29th, but I did not check my mail on that date so I cannot say if it was delivered on time as promised.The product itself looks very durable stainless steel tube with a screw in top and a clip for the pocket.I could carry 5 wood toothpick with mint taste. More than 5 would be tight and would be hard to slide one out. It would hold more if one opts for the thin toothpicks. Overall very good product. I give it 5 stars."
5,Great,i really like this toothpick holder! It is very well made. Fits nicely in your pocket. Now I always have a toothpick handy!!!
1,Don't buy any Sony Vaio's.,Sony Vaio's are a defective product and should not be sold. Once you have a problem customer service/repairs/refunds are non existant and they repeatedly get you off the phone telling you that they will have someone call you back. Never yet a call back! DON'T buy the Sony Vaio and if you do or have please file a complaint with the BBB online.
5,High School musical,This was an excellent purchase for my 12 year old...........She loved it and the xtended scenes are great.
1,Cheaper Way To Go,If you buy all three of these separately its only 71 dollars and you can get free super saver shippin so really there is no need for this 3 pack sayin its a deal.....just thought i might try to help some people save money if they take the time to read this
4,Charmed one,I found this band because they do the theme song to the WB TV show Charmed !!!! and I liked everything I d/l so I kept getting more and more and well Now I feel I must buy more!
3,"Charmed, shmarmed","Butler has always had a fantastic voice, which continues here, but for all of you youngsters who love ""How Soon Is Now"", please check out the original by The Smiths. Only then can you proclaim your love for this song...."
5,Mature Richard Butler,"Butler has taken his fine voice and musicality and combined it with a more personal and mature worldview and created a great album, much more honest and engaging than the Furs. The addition of Richard Fortus on guitar provides a new tilt to the landscape with a slightly grittier, edgier and more varied sound. Highly recommended."
4,Am I wrong? NO!,"Simply said, this is a great album. With some strong influence from his early band, Psychedlic Furs, Richard Butlter rocks hard as probably one of the best frontmen of the 80's."
4,Very good. Very good indeed.,Although I don't like this album as much as Try some eatone it is still totally rad. I think I listened to Am I wrong for an hour on repeat mode one day. It is sooo good. Definitely a welcome edition to my CD collection.Tara
5,Great!,"my plant was in great health. A little wilted, but that is normal. does include instructions. will buy again."
5,Aralia,"It was worth for the price on unexpected size tree in great condition and love it; so appreciated your service and would buy again from you when necessary.Thanks!Suzanne (Pittsburgh, PA)"
2,Received wrong order twice,"While I thank you for returning payment so quckly.. I still would like to have the pictured plant if you realy have it in stock.. If you do and will confirm the fact, I will reorder. The plant has slender long leaves and grows horzontally Base is wood stem polyscias FruticosaPlease resond even f you do not have and I will look elsewhereThank you in advance Alma Chomsky"
1,looked like a weed plant from the backyard !,i thought bonsai would be something exotic. dont waste your money on this particular one. doesnt look any fancier than a plant growing on the side of the road.
1,Ming pre-Bonsai plant,"The plant came here all yellowing, hopeing I can bring it back to health. I am very good with all types of plants but this one arrived unhealthy"
2,Pretty but finicky..,"This plant is so picky in how your care for it- cant have any air drafts around, have to water just right and have just right partial shade spot.. I killed mine, too finicky."
5,great!,"Excellent! uplifting and spiritually fulfilling read! Dannah Gresh is great - I would also highly recommend her ""5Questions that Reveal the Life that God designed for me"""
5,The Green Slime,"Some years ago I actually saw The Green Slime at a movie theatre. It has aired on local televison at least several times since. I am glad to see that this one has endured, destined to be a cult classic, I think. It is the cheeziest of the cheezy, the wackiest of the wacky, and the slimiest of the slimy. Buy this video and you will laugh!!"
3,"One of those cheeseburger, fries, and milkshake flicks!","This is definitely not for those looking for a serious movie experience. It is a fluffy, fun montage of really bad 60's special effects, cardoard characters, and a plot that makes Spaceballs seem like something out of Faulkner! ... One of those Saturday drive-in midnight matinee flicks that are so bad that they're good for a bit of fun. There's basically two possible reactions you'll have to this movie: either you'll hate it so much you'll gasp in despair or you'll laugh yourself silly and invite your weekend buddies to see it along with you.MST3K should get a handle on this.You'll like it if you're into those kind of movies that don't take themselves seriously and use their ... ??'cheesyness'?? ... to good effect."
2,Quite tedious film...,...but the monster-fights are interesting. Video quality partially not as good as could be.
2,"I had to round up to 2 as there was no 1.8 stars, cheesy!","This is definitely the late sixties early seventies, cheesy as all get out. It reminded me of the series that was on tv done with marionettes called ""THUNDERBIRDS"". The sad thing about this movie is that I bought it because of the theme song ""GREEN SLIME"". I was a teenager back at the time this movie came out and remembered the theme from it so thought, what the heck. The story line being one of an asteroid on a collision course with the earth, shades of ""Deep Impact"", unbelievable how things keep going in circles, the next thing you know I will be wearing ""Bell Bottoms"". Oh no I think I `ve got some green slime on them, no it was just mouldy cheese."
1,bootleg copy beware,"Received my copy of the green slime today, it is a purple disk with poorly printed cover and no inserts, amazon says they will replace it, we shall see, I will report this to law enforcement"
1,It Slimed Many of us...,"It sounds like we ALL saw this as kids...maybe we need a therapy group...I was in the first grade when my older brother told me he was going to see ""The Green Slime."" I wanted to see it so bad I thought I would bust. Years later I felt like shaking his hand and thanking him for keeping me from being slimed. I suppose if you are in an extremely silly mood, the movie might be fun to watch for the cheessy special effects and the 60's hair styles. The title song will be remembered for moments to come."
4,The Green Slime,"The Green Slime [Remaster]One of my favorate 1960s sci-fi B-movie greats. Great American-Japanese style space science fiction about a crew sent to stop an approaching asteriod about to collide with earth. Very good acting and action/adventure. Some gore and violence as the creepy space monsters multiply, killing anyone that tries to get away from them, or get in their way! Definately worth a watch for those who enjoy the sci-fi movies of their youth."
3,The remake,"I saw this with my father in the 60s, and weapt for the demise of the misunderstood Green Slime. Full of metaphors. Green? Green with envy, of course.When the inevitable remake comes, mark my words, and see if Marilyn Manson doesn't do a cover of the poignant, psychedelic Love Theme of the Green Slime."
