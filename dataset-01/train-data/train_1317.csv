3,Not what I'd call Christian rock,"With no mention of God, Christ, or Jesus......... it would be hard to call this CD Christian. That being said, I've not listened to it (but read the lyrics)........it was bought for our son as a present and we are very disappointed that this group is promoted as a Christian rock band. Guess we will stick with bands like Kutless who are not ashamed to use the name of the Lord in their songs. There are worse things out there to listen to, but as Christians, it is a good idea to listen to things that uplift the spirit and praise the name of God. So, I'm not saying it is a BAD CD, just not what we would concider Christian. One warning......this is a thick CD with a DVD being on the other side......it got STUCK in our son's iBook!!"
1,A major dissappointment!!!!!!!!!,"These guys have sure turned into super stars alright. It totally shows in there music. They went from being a Christian band to barely even mentioning God at all. Sell out for the cash. If they weren't a christian band before this album, this album would of been much better. And the freaken music protection crap is pissing me off. These dudes are rich and there worried about poeple burning there music. I like to make mixed cd's and now I can't use anything off this cd. And I own there other cd's. Its not like I'm stealing them. I'm selling this album when I'm done writing this review. What a waist of money."
1,argh!,"Switchfoot sux! Switchfoot was good back in the old days with ""Legend of Chin"" (1997) and ""New Way To Be Human"" (1999). Their third cd (""Learning To Breathe"" 2000) was mellower, but still a decent cd. But, ""The Beautiful Letdown"" seriously, these guys sold out big time, and their new cd is no better! If you want to hear GOOD switchfoot, please pick up their older cds and throw the new crap away!"
5,This is what we need now,"In a world so easily build upon false principles and materialism, it is so refreshing to hear Jon Foreman write with such passion about what he believes so sincerely, which harkon a young Bono, who so desperately wants to help us, that we really feel he cares about all of us individually. Its so refreshing as a young man to hear music that is uplifting and spiritual, but also can relate to where we are today as a people. That is where Switchfoots significance lies, and that is why this band will continue to succeed as long as it keeps it always remembers what makes this group so significant."
5,A great CD!,"To anyone who liked Switchfoot in the past, you will absolutely LOVE this new album! Its positive and clever lyrics make it an awesome album. The top hit ""Stars"" shows how the artists look at their surroundings in awe. I advise any Switchfoot lovers (and those of you who haven't heard of them before) to pick up this CD. You won't regret it!"
3,Well.....,"This is an OK band with some good guitar, lyrics, etc... but i cant really find any originality or anything that really gets me going. I mean i was a fan of this band but they need to stop playing the same thing over and over and over. I've gotten so sick and tired of buying cd's of theres that sound so much the same. Plus the copyright protection on this thing is a complete hassle.I only suggest buying this if you are just getting into the band or you really really reallyl like this band.-TLane"
1,Copy Protection Problems,"I love the music, but the copy protection is very annoying. You need to have administrative privelege to install software to play this CD on a computer. And the quality of the WMA that the software produces is poor. The posted workaround using CDEX doesn't work for me - CDEX won't recognize the CD. Plays fine in my car. Avoid this CD if you want to play it in a computer."
2,Disappointed.,"I have been a big fan of switchfoot since their first cds. I own all of their cds, dvds and even a couple shirts. Needless to say, I was ecstatic for the new ""Nothing is Sound"" album. When I bought it and listened to it in my car on the way home, I was so dissapointed. There is only a hint of the ""old Switchfoot"" sound, and the lyrics are awful. Upon arriving home, I looked at all of the lyrics, and instead of heart felt words (as seemed to be writting for the previous albums), these lyrics seemed to be slopped together to appear ""artistic"" and ""unique"".I am so disappointed in this cd, and as mention in previous reviews, the copyright protection is aggravating as well. :("
4,Nothing is SOUND!!!,"One of the best cds Switchfoot has released. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because of the content protection. I couldn't rip the cd and that made me feel ripped off. Other than that one obstacle this is an awesome cd. Keep up the good work, Switchfoot!"
5,Incredible Album,"Nothing Is Sound is, by far, Switchfoot's strongest album to date. The lyrics are powerful and when listening to the songs, they motivate you to give though to what is being sung about. The music is virtually flawless. Having listened to music from Switchfoot for the past 8 years, it is unbelievable to see how much each musician has grown and improved. This album seems to be an extension of The Beautiful Letdown, the albums flow into each other. If you have liked Switchfoot's previous music, you are in for a real treat with Nothing Is Sound."
5,Switchfoot's Best CD Yet,"I love Switchfoot's music and this is by far my favorite CD yet. I love the amazing sound and vocals. It is definately an album to play loud with your windows down. Everyone should hear it! There is a great balance among the songs with my favorite being ""The Shadow Proves the Sunshine."" Definately an album that every Switchfoot fan (and everyone) should buy!"
1,DON'T BUY -- SONY DRM WILL CRIPPLE YOUR COMPUTER!!!!!,"Stay away from this CD!!!! Even if you only plan to listen to it on ordinary home stereo CD players or car CD players, be advised this disc may not play on them -- because of Sony's DRM it won't play on a lot of CD players. Don't waste your money buying something that you won't be able to listen to, or worse yet that will infect your computer with a horrible rootkit that will leave it open to hackers.BOYCOTT SONY!!!!"
1,Do not buy,"If you do buy, do not put this CD in your PC! Sony assumes that all for its customers are morons. They are hacking our systems. Look up ""rootkit and sony"" on google."
4,What a great rock album,"Great stuff. ""The Beautiful Letdown"" was awesome, but ""Nothing Is Sound"" takes that to the next level. Any fan of rock and roll should have this in their collection. Standout tracks are ""Stars"", ""Happy is a Yuppie Word"" and ""Daisy"".The production is outstanding. All the instrumentation and vocals come through very clearly. The stereo mix sounds great, but the Dolby Digital 5.1 surround mix on the DVD side of the disc is absolutely mind-numbing. It would be nicer if the 5.1 mix was DVD-Audio, but I'll take Dolby Digital over CD-quality 2-channel stereo any day.Also, for people who are talking about the copy protection, please write your reviews for the standard CD. The DualDisc edition is NOT copy protected. If your computer drive can't read the CD side, then that's just it. It can't read it. That doesn't mean it's copy protected. I own many DualDisc titles (including this one) and have not yet run into one I can't rip to my computer."
5,Love it!,"I've always been a Switchfoot fan, in fact they have been my favorite band for quite some time. However, this album is in my opinion the best they have made thus far. I just bought it earlier tonight, and I've been listening to the streamed preview that you can listen to when you buy the CD. I know I need to get to sleep, but there isn't a song that I can bring myself to stop at, and I'm on my third time through. I honestly feel that this album is leaps and bounds better than The Beautiful Letdown."
2,Nothing is unique,"I was jacked to hear their new disk after the masterpiece, The Beautiful Letdown, and was abruptly kicked in the nards upon hearing Nothing is Sound. The hopeful melancholy that worked so well on the prior album is just missing here. It's too samey. It sounds like every other pop goes distorted. Lyrically, I can't believe Mr. Foreman even thinks this comes close to The Beautiful Letdown. Therefore, obviously, go buy The Beautiful Letdown-you won't be dissappointed."
4,HELP!!!!,i too have heard about the virus stuff thats put on your computer when you download the non-dualdisc version of this cd on to itunes/hardrive or burn it. does any one know if that virus is on the dual disc version. please respond cuz i want to put this on my ipod and i feel pretty ripped off
2,smooth leather concealment waistpack,"The product arrived as described. The major problem is that one of the zippers broke after my wife had it for about two weeks. I think that the product should have made using better components. The bag is very pretty and useful, but I was very disappointed that the zipper broke so soon. The zipper can be replaced fairly easilty, but it should have lasted longer than two weeks."
4,Good Value product for First time No Frills GPS Buyers,"I have used this GPS for about a year now.Directions are Excellent, Right & Left LED is a great feature.Things I Miss in this GPSItinerary for Directions, More Routing Options, Choice of Voice, More Locations details (like phone # etc).I guess I will have to spend little more to have all those options.... ;)"
3,"Its just ""okay""","I had been using an old Garmin Street pilot which you can only choose a region of the country. I upgraded with this Dual model. It's small, compact, nice design. It comes with a car cigarette lighter kit,but NO DC adapter so the only way to use it is to plug it in the car!! Why? I dont get this. The screen is hard to see in the daylight. It has no compass so you wont know which direction you are going. A unique feature is the light indicator on both ends of the unit which is like a turning indicator. Im glad this unit is less than $240 otherwise, its not worth it. Not upgradable also. Im contented but not really happy about this unit. It will get me from point A to B with its simple navigation style."
3,Rumi journal not for me...,"This is a beautiful journal. I, as an avid writer and reader have tons of journals from the time I was a child. There was just something about this journal that didn't inspire me at all.My best friend is an art/lit major and I gave it to her. She loved it. She wrote in it almost every day. This just proves what I always say, a journal is as unique as the person that writes in it...along with the personal memories that go in it.If I didn't have her to share this one with, I was going to return it for one of the higher end line of paperblanks journals, which I love. Yes, it helps if a journal is pretty and inspiring, but it has to speak to you. When this one spoke to me it said...""Please find me a new home...lol*"" Sorry Rumi"
2,Lots of FLuff - not much meat,I found Brian Tracy's delivery to be so so and found some of his comments to be harsh and lacking empathy. He offered some good points but not anything new and I wouldn't recommend you spending your money on this particular product.Doug
2,Just Like Everything Else....bland,"I don't see how writing a book about urban teens in a writing style than could be written y an illiterate fool off the street can be considered a great collection of short stories. The concept isn't new, the stories all sound the same."
4,L55w,"Though the picture quality is not as good as my old Olympus, the wide angle capability is just what I needed. I also like the very small size and the ultra-convenient base that does both downloading and charging. Very happy."
5,like a real fireplace (without the mess),"This was areally fun. My guests got a kick out of how real it seemed. If you stand close you can ""almost"" feel the heat. I love the ambiance."
3,The Common Words Of A Common Man,"""The Buck Stops Here"" is a compact collection of sayings of Harry Truman. It is organized topically. I read it in search of quotes for a class on Harry Truman for which I was preparing. For this purpose I would rate it as successful. I ended up noting 16 entries. This book does provide the reader with an insight into Truman's thoughts and words. This book provides few memorable quotations to elevate your speech. I do not fault the book. Truman was common, not very quotable. It is often said that Republicans like to quote Democrats. After reading this book one will understand why Truman is rarely quoted. He was truly a common man in word and action. This is not one of the better quotation books which I have found."
1,I was the sacrificial lamb,"I suppose this album might delight a true 'vocal-artist' fan. I have always considered myself a fan of Edda Dell'Orso, since I first heard her 4-octave ranged resonance in the early Eastwood movies.However, this album, is to me, more a collection of period pieces--more a compilation of 60's and 70's second-rate B-movie Italian soundtracks than what I'd consider big productions. There's no English whatsoever on the album, or song titles, which is no overly unexpected, but I thought at least the movie titles might be footnoted.The recordings are clear, but lacking in spark, resonance, depth of sound, and in general, are flat in their performance and rendition. I'd offer it up for sale as used, but I don't know anyone I'd sell it to in good conscience.However, if you're a glutton for it, and your curiousity is unending, take it from me for $12 shipped. moredes@hotmail.com"
3,Sauvage Twist One Piece,"Although this swimsuit is truly sexy, I dont know how one can actually be able to wear this at the beach or at the pool without moving around. Everytime you move it exposes a part of your body that you may not want to expose exactly. It almost doesnt leave anything to the imagination, no need really because it shows it all.....too revealing."
3,The title is misleading,"Being new to Illustrator 7 I needed something to get mt feet wet. After reading Mr Staten Island's review I figured why not. The Author knows what he is talking about, but my biggest problem is the fact that there are no color pics at all to show you what a finished product looks like. They look like cartoons. Where are the ""real world"" examples? The chapter on wacky text effects is a joke, it gives you some insight but once again where are the real exapmles. Some of the examples don't come out like his do in the book. This book is for someone who has a graphics background. I got a bad feeling about this book when I first opened it. This book may help you, but it sure didn't help me. I feel like I wasted some money on this."
4,A good book but could have been better,I bought this book as I was new to this software. It does explain in detail the various points. I feel their should have bee a chapter for using Illustrator for web and a bit more on using Illustrator ad Photoshop together
2,decent,this product is ok i dont seem to get massive results with it ive def had better seems like it made me gain extra fat and nut just mussle also allthough it does laat a really long time for the money its a good buy but idk if its worth the time to take anymore
1,No good,"Very long process to get this to dissolve in the shakes I use. Always a lot at the bottom of the glass, and grainy going down. Won't buy again."
3,Falls to the bottom,"I haven't really gotten into this creatine yet since I'm finishing up another bottle. However, every time I have tried it, much of it quickly falls to the bottom of the glass. You can refill the glass and stir again, but half of it will fall to the bottom again. It's very frustrating."
3,"Not the finest, but cheap","For the most part, creatine is creatine regardless of brand, so I was primarily shopping for price. Dymatize Nutrition's creatine was the least expensive so I went with it. It isn't nearly as fine a powder as the last creatine that I bought - it has a consistency more like sugar than powdered sugar - but the price was right."
2,Horrible at dissolving vs. other brands I have used.,"I love and have purchased many of Dymatize's protein powders in the past, so I went ahead and bought this creatine also. I must say, it does do it job in helping me perform betting during my workouts, especially since I am eating lower carb than I normally do. The downside of this creatine is that it is the consistency of sugar but doesn't desolve as well. I have shaken this stuff for at least 5 minutes, just for it to still settle at the bottom. Most creatine powders I have purchase in the past had no problem dissolving and were finer powders than this. I will not be purchasing this again in the future. Sorry Dymatize."
2,Not a fan,"I think instead of micronized they meant supersized. This stuff is similiar to cat litter and mixes like it. I don't mean spoon in a cup mixing, I'm talking shaker cup. I moved to this from the five star creatine, because I wanted something I could mix with the BSN True Mass, but the five star only comes in fruit punch, but it's worth it to have to drink it on it's on rather than drink down gravel."
3,It is what it is - cheap.,"This micronized creatine does not dissolve well, so be wary if that is what you are looking for in your purchase. The price wasn't bad, but there is a lot of residue left in the glass even with constant stirring."
5,Don't listen to negative comments about not mixing well. This product Works!,"I have used this product before and it has worked for me. People keep saying it makes you dehydrated and it does but thats with almost all muscle building supplements. Just drink more water and you'll be fine. As far as mixing goes, i never tried mixing it with water, i mix it with protein shakes and it mixes perfectly. I take 1.5 scoops of it along with 2 scoops of protein in 12oz of either milk or water depending on what time i'm taking it. You can't even taste it. Nothing left over at bottom of glass. As long as you know how to mix it you'll be fine. J"
2,Doubtfull of quality,Not getting the results from this product that I get from other creatine (including other 100% micronized creatine products). Maybe I just got a bad batch or something. I thought Dymatize was supposed to be a good brand. I like their protein products.
4,Good product,I dont know why some companies charge more for creatine. This product works great and is a great price. What more could you want?
5,Perfect,"Cheap, reilable, small contaner for perfect storage, last a long time. I take every morning after work outs. Great stuff."
1,Warning: only half the novel,"This is only volume 1 of a 2-volume novel, so don't buy it if you need to read the whole novel. It is a quite readable photocopy of the original book, but who wants to buy half a book? I should have known when I saw that there are only 286 pages. There are other reprints available that are 470 pages. None of them mention volumes. But I'm assuming the 470-page varieties are the complete novel, so I'll try those."
1,They should pay YOU to buy it.,"This is the poorest excuse for a strategy guide I have ever seen. I hardly discusses strategy at all -- it gives the shallowest of descriptions and doesn't discuss the pieces of the game that are the most critical -- switching to Bump and Run and a myriad of other advanced options.I read the manual to learn the basics. I bought this thinking it would go more in-depth. Truly pathetic. Additionally, the screen shots are confusing or wrong and come from Madden 2000, not 2001!If you're looking for insight into Madden 2001, look elsewhere. This is a definite Loser of a guide. If I could give this 0 or less Stars, I would--but the system won't allow it."
1,not really very helpful,Don't waste your money go to gamefaqs.com for free stategy guides and cheats
1,Deceptive Picture and product info.,The lights are fine but the three additional lenses as in the information were not pictured on the box and does not come in the kit. The picture and information is deceptive and incorrect. The lenses are an additional twenty dollars.
2,missing parts,"rec. order from amazon missing the extra lens,returned for replacement and again missing lens.will return again and shop somewhere else."
2,"MODEL 735 PICTURED, ACTUALLY 736",AMAZON NEEDS TO UPDATE THE PICTURE AND DESCRIPTION FOR THIS PRODUCT. THE DESCRIPTION SAYS KG HILITES 736 BUT ACTUALLY SHOWS A PICTURE AND DESCRIPTION OF THE 735s. MAKE SURE IF YOU WANT THE EXTRA LENSES YOU SEARCH FOR THE 735s.
5,Got the book on time,Very cheap and half the price then buying from any book store and seller send the book on time.
2,too late,"I ordered two of the same poster and received only one, it was delivered much later than expect, and it was wrinkled in several spots.When I phoned the company regarding the product, they did take care of the problem, (this one was also a present and it, too, arrived after the party and wrinkled in several spots.) I feel that the second package should have been sent out (at their expense) overnight or something."
3,"Very cute, but -","It arrived, and as I was unwrapping it, a large and very noticeable crack became apparent on the inside of the holder. It may have just been the finish that was cracked, thus showing the white ceramic underneath, but... I was bummed. I would have ordered a replacement, but I remembered that I had a little ceramic toothpick holder that my son had made when in school, so I just returned it. At $10+, it is a bit pricey, but have to say, it's as cute as can be, and would have worked fine."
4,"Colorful, retro style for your countertop","This sugar packet caddy is a perfect match to the cobalt spoon rest I already owned. It adds a splash of color to my countertop, retro-style. The color and glazing is very even, and the edges have a slight ""worn"" look that adds detail. It's large enough to keep plenty of sugar packets at hand, but doesn't take up much space. The only possible negative for this caddy is that it is a little wider than the standard sugar/sweetener packet, so the packets tend to move around a little rather than staying perfectly lined up. Aside from this, the caddy is adorable, and I'm looking forward to adding more Fiesta pieces to my kitchen! (And it's dishwasher-safe... what more can you ask for?!?)Contrary to a previous review posted here, Amazon had no trouble getting this gorgeous little sugar packet caddy delivered. It actually arrived sooner than expected - within about 4 days of ordering it - and that was with the free shipping option."
4,Like bringing a little bit of a classic diner into your home!,Works great for tea bags and alwys looks so darn proper. I'm quite happy with this purchase; I have it on a tray with the Fiesta ware sugar bowl & creamer.
5,Ultimate Meditation Music,"Etherial, atmospheric, ""new age"" music! WOnderful for deep meditation and healting massage. Two 30 minute tracks. This music is for peace and tranquility. NO guitars, rhythms and the like. Heavenly, angelic peace! For meditative peace NONE better."
3,Interdimensional music,"I find Iasos to be very well versed musically for meditative purposes, although I find Steve Roach and Ahkidomo to be a bit heavier on the key board side, which is what I prefer. Angelic Music has a nice blend of both new age and etherial musical tapestries that lends nicely to a soothing experience. Is this cd worth the money? Yes. Spend it and enjoy the ride."
4,Check out Poor Old Lu,"To be fair, the above reviewer should have mentioned that this CD contains music from 3 different previous OOP Aaron Sprinkle CDs and a new song. His best work, though, is found in his work with Poor Old Lu. Star Studded Super Step, Mindsize, Sin, Straight Six, A Picture of the Eighth Wonder, and The Waiting Room.It should also be noted that he's a highly regarded producer/engineer for some terrific bands:Starflyer 59Demon HunterKutlessJoy ElectricDamien JuradoPedro the LionMxPxSquad 5-O"
3,This is a pretty good CD,"You know 3 stars may be a bit harsh because there are glimpses of absolute genius spread out across this CD. ""Sweeter than me"" is one of the coolest songs I've heard in a long, long time....and is easily worth the price of the CD alone. ""Colorblind"" is another piece of brilliance....it reminds me a bit of Lindsay Buckingham. ""Not All Bad"" is also wonderful. Aaron strikes me as one of those kinds of guys that could break out at any moment and be an American pop superstar. He makes writing catchy pop tunes seem almost effortless.But having said this, there are several songs on here that are melodically forgetable....which is unfortunate because Aaron has a really cool musical sound and has a great knack for writing interesting lyrics.One last thing....the lack of lyrics in the cd booklet is a little disappointing. All in all this CD is definately worth a listen."
4,Great Cowboy Shirt,"My husband loves these shirts that snap and especially short sleeve ones. I snatch these up as soon as I find a good deal on one. My only complaint with this particular seller is that it does not come in TALL sizes. That is why I have to give it a ""4"" Otherwise it is a very nice material and my husband loves it. Blair Men sells these snap front shirts in Tall sizes but they are not made as nicely as this one."
4,Praise for the Elephant God,"It is rare to find an author so dedicated to her craft as Vijaya Schartz. The setting is beautiful, characters believable. The book is carefully plotted to keep the reader wanting more. I highly reccommend this book."
4,A Wonderful Look at the Culture of India,"Vijaya has given us a fascinating look into the culture of India, immersed in a fast-paced love story. I so appreciate her glossary of terms. If you're looking to learn more about this country and enjoy a tale that will stimulate your imagination, read this book."
3,An enjoyable read,"Vijaya Schartz paints a vivid picture. Reading her book truly transports you to India. It's both descriptive and emotive. The reason I rank it as 3 stars is that it is not a complex story or a challenging ""read."" It is fun and offers an armchair vacation. I enjoyed it, I just wasn't challenged and didn't read/ learn anything new. Don't let that stop you from getting it. This is the perfect book to read on the beach, while commuting or on a rainy day."
3,"Just ok, nice idea, too predictable","An easy read, but just not that believable how perfectly it all works out. Some things also just didn't make sense, not believable how quickly the protagonist changes at the beginning if the book and finds her path. I wasn't convinced. A better written book with a similar topic is My Name is Memory."
1,Organizing for the Rich and Lazy,"This book does exactly what it purports to do: it tells you how to organize your life with a minimum of personal effort. That sounded great to me, but when I actually read the book, I realized that ""the lazy way"" meant ""hiring servants to do everything."" Unless you have a significant amount of disposable income, this book will not be of much help. Ms. Ahlgren's suggestions frequently come down to the same basic message: There is no problem that cannot be solved by throwing money at it. As a young, married professional and student, I cannot afford to hire a housekeeper, a cook, someone to pay the bills, a gardener, and a complete suite of office furniture. If I did, then this might have been a valuable book, but, as it is, I am going in search of something that will help me learn to manage my time without encouraging gross fiscal irresponsibility."
4,"Fun, useful & not-overbearingly-serious!!","This book is funny and fun and helpful at the same time. It reads like a good friend who has a cheery demeanor but is going to make sure you finish this project one way or another, and this is a topic where you need that kind of firm---how great that it's charming too---guidance. I can't recommend this enough; it's accessible and so useful and yet not preachy or silly."
1,Pitiful,"I bought this for my husband's birthday, to replace a Timex that he has had for years which still works, but the band is broken. I thought it would be nice to get him a nice watch with a little more cachet than a Timex. It had to be able to go into our 4 ft deep pool because hubby is too lazy to take it off. So I found this; water resistant to 100 meters NOT! The inside of the watch face misted up, end of story. I returned it and am looking for another uncool but reliable Timex."
5,beautiful!!!,I originaly was looking for a gift for a cruise remeberance...When I received this it was absolutly the prettiest charm I could have hoped for..I immediatly reordered one for myself..
4,Nice detail,"Very nice, quality piece for the price. I bought this as a gift. Very nice detail as well.The only small thing that I was disappointed with was that there was no gift box, which made it difficult to find one to give it as a gift. Even a cheap cardboard one would have been okay.Had it come with a box, I would have rated it with 5 stars....."
1,Don't waste your money,"This review refers only to the book printing quality not to the contents.I had purchased some books from Springer in the past (Like Arnold Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics, Lang Algebra etc..) and found them beautifully edited: good binding, paper etc..And to my surprise I was very disappointed with the overall quality of this book, poor binding -glued instead of sewn- bad quality paper -forming waves at the binding spine, etc..You pay for a quality item, a book you can use for years, and you get a hardbound crap that you can not left open in a table without holding it tight risking to lose the pages after a few days of use in the process.I find this unacceptable in books costing 60$+. Sadly I find this to occur very often, publishers should be more careful with their printings and custumers should demand a better quality.Don't waste your money.A reader."
1,Worthless,"I used this for a grad class and it sucked! Language is bad, no examples, seemed to give no real insight, i highly recommend getting a different book"
3,Rolls? Fiesta!!!,"Somebody told: ""It is a Rolls Royce of ST1100 manuals"" Hm....My opinion is based on experiences from practice: It is NOT a RR, it might be a Ford Fiesta. You can travel by it anywhere as by an RR but cannot say the same experiences, pleasure, etc.This book is useful if You have no other manuals!!! You can start something by it and get some ideas which You can use for guess the really ""how to..."" necessary steps.Please do not believe in my words, use it parallelly and compare it with the Clymer ST1100 manual! You will see and feel the difference."
1,Will Rust and has Sharp edges,"Initially, I loved the look of this item, but over time it started to rust and finally I had to just throw it away. I also cut my hand on the edge that is revealed when you separate the top from the bottom. If you buy this item, take a look at those edges and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. You would hope that any ""soap"" box would be waterproof but the fact that the inside started to rust made it completely unusable. I always give a product a little time before I review it and it only took a few months for me to come back on here and want to warn others looking to purchase an item like this."
4,"Looks very classy, holds big bars of soap","I own two of these. They hold bigger bars of soap, the 250g bars that won't fit in the store-bought plastic boxes. They look classier than the plastic ones too. They hold up well (eg, don't take scratches).The only neg is that they can be very difficult to open. The lids ""snug"" on to the base ... and they do so very tightly.I bought them from Frenchy Bee and I have been consistently satisfied with them as a vendor."
2,WHAT'S WITH THE COOLING FAN??,"This unit is unusable in a bedroom because of an unbelievably loud cooling fan. The fan never shuts off, even when the machine is turned off; you have to unplug it to silence it! I'm of the opinion that Home Theater components should be silent, but this has a fan as loud as the fan on my desktop PC. Really poor, arrogant engineering.The picture and features are fine, lots of connection options, easy to set up. I got it to work right out of the box. The machine is slow to acquire the programming guide, but they've done a good job with the guide itself. The remote also has channel and volume buttons that are too small and the RF doesn't work, it's basically only a line of sight IR.Bottom line, if you use it in a media room, in a closed case (with a glass front, RF doesn't work) and you can get it for <$400, it might be a buy, but not for your bedroom."
2,bland,"This one did nothing for me at all. Bland ""good"" characters being forced into actions (or should I say reactions) by the marginally more interesting evil characters. The writing itself wasn't good enough to make up for obvious plotting. Made it three quarters of the way through and realized I just didn't care enough to finish the book."
1,characters have been neglected to fuel a meaningless plot,"While the story starts out very original, it quickly declines into a very cliche retelling of vampires and werewolves, just with different names and a little attempt at political intrigue. The characters are not well written, short sighted and entirely selfish in their goals. Even though the author tries to add interest with multiple story lines, she doesn't keep track of all the characters well, so while one character is doing one thing you have the distinct impression that the others are just sitting around doing nothing. There are hints at interesting cultures and settings, but the author ignores them and focuses on going forward with a plot that I cannot bring myself to care about."
3,"Great imagination, but...","The author has a wonderful imagination and can put together an interesting plot, but I thought her characters were flat. I just never cared about them one way or another. I also found it a little jarring to see cliched, modern phrases, like a will (""I, so-and-so, being of sound mind and body"") when the author clearly shows such creativity elsewhere. Nitpicky, I know. I'm looking forward to her next book(s), because I think this is an author who will get better."
2,Flat Book - Intriguing World,"I read the Publishers Weekly review and was very excited to read this first book in the series, but on the whole was quite disappointed.While the world is reasonably interesting, and, for some, the existence of magic and limited technology side by side will be intriguing, the characters could not be less compelling. I never got the impression that any of the subject characters had any thoughts beyond those put on the page. They're flat and overly simplistic. Even the politics in the world are extremely simple. Kudos to Ash for not going down the well travelled road of the typical fantasy adventure, but she needs some serious seasoning before she can create people that truly live and breathe in the mind of this reader at least. This reminded me a lot of George R. R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire books, but they're a pale imitation at best. I'm afraid I can't recommend it."
2,Two stars for managing to think of using Tsarist Russia in fantasy,"The author deserves credit for developing a Russian-themed world as the background for her story. The curse of the principal character is also interesting.And that's about it.Extraordinarily sparse characters and a pointless and uninteresting plot combine to render this book an utter waste of time and money.I'd rather re-read one of the latter Wheel of Time books than finish this book, let alone continue with the series. That's how bad it is."
2,I'd give it 2 1/2 stars,"This book was so-so. It has an interesting premise, but wasn't a page turner. It was hard to get into, but once you get about 75 pages in things do pick up (although not much).As I think others have mentioned, the characterization seemed a bit too convenient at times. I have to say that Gavril's mother really was annoying - such an idiot! Kiukiu seems to change too quickly to be believable - she ends up mastering new skills that take others years to master. And as for the feud? The resolution is unbelievable, as is Gavril's solution to his problem.Check it out from the library. I'm glad I did."
2,He's really small,He is a cute bear but very tiny for the price. He could fit in an xmas stocking but by no means is a full size huggable bear. Very soft and sweet thought.
5,"Want to act like a Leader, then simply read this book!",I read this book in one of my master classes and took the advantage of reading it in my life. Especially the communication chapter describes all the required traits that you should do in your both professional and personal life in order to become an effective people. I am sure that this book will be your potential consultant. Highly recommended...
2,Not the real thing...,"When I got the box I wasn't happy to see it wasn't the REAL Fukuoku. It wasn't. Yes it has may attachments, and we all know what this is REALLY for... it just doesn't fully make the cut. Spend the extra money and go for the real thing."
1,Not the real thing....,"Just like another reviewer has posted, I too have ordered and received a knock off product that is NOT the real Fukuoku 9000. The box isn't the same either.Mine also DIDNT COME WITH ACCESSORIES!!!!You suck body Back companyIt does work but its not what I ordered. Will be returning... not happy."
2,not even worth the little i spent,"this really wasnt worth the little bit i spent on it, it cut off when rubbing against temples. The attachments arent very soothing either............. not worth it!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Alarm doesn't work,"I just received this timer, the alarm does not work. The timer counts down but no ring to let me know it's done. Very disappointed."
1,"Cheep, cheep, cheep...","Poorly made, after a year of ues it failed to go off once. Closer inspection revealed that friction had caused the plastic parts to weld themselves together. The dial no longer turned. It further failed the flight and bounce test in the driveway before joining the rest of the trash."
3,A little less sturdy than I'd like,"For starters, this is a pretty nice scale. The glass bowl is good looking, the scale is accurate and precise. However, calling it ""Cast Iron"" is a misnomer. It isn't made of cast iron, it doesn't look anything like cast iron, and it definitely doesn't weigh anything like cast iron. That's really my primary concern with the scale. It's a really lightweight black plastic, and easy to chip, nor does it have enough weight to really hold it in place on a slick counter top. If I had known the base material, I might have considered a different scale."
3,"Good with general use, not small weights","I bought this for measuring hops for home brewing beer. Accuracy is very important down to the gram. It simply doesn't do well measuring below an ounce. It may work for more general kitchen use, but if you're looking for consistent accuracy with grams or fractions of ounces, I'd look elsewhere. Aside from that, it's built well, and is easy to use. I'm giving it a 3 star review because I believe it is a good product for larger weights."
4,Excellent,"The author describes the careers and recordings of many Texans that found fame in other places like Jack Teagarden, Scott Joplin, Hot Lips Page, Harry James and others. For anyone who loves jazz, it will be fascinating reading."
2,A hard review to write...,This is hard because my grandmother wrote this book and it was one of the only things she did in her life that showed for her efforts.The book is sourced and well explained but after about 20 pages in you start to get a sense that she has a disdain or hatred of white men or people. I tried to see if the book goes around it after awhile but had to stop reading it.It may be factual but there is a lot of synthesis of white men and religion being the point of destruction for the Wappo in their way of life and as a people.I wanted to learn more about the Wappo and their life... not how abusive white men are in the name of the church... or the Spainiards etc.I had to throw the book away because it left such a bad vibe in me that I didn't want it in my house.I love my grandmother even though she has passed away but this book is not such a good idea in terms of transcending the spirit of a people. It only attempts to abash history to make a case for these people in time.Chris Beard
2,Not what I expected,"Being an avid fan of the original Dune series, I was quite excited to see the story brought to a conclusion. This book should not have any claim on such a title. Now I wasn't expecting it to be written like the elder Herbert, but this novel was written like a rehashed, burnt-out version of Herber/Andersons prequel trilogies. Very dissapointed."
1,Avoid this book.,"This is the worst book I've ever read. Period.Too bad I didn't read the reviews on Amazon before I bought it at a brick-and-mortar store. It covers 19 years of utterly boring non-action, punctuated by a few brief ninja-type murders, written as if by a severely disturbed 5-year-old.""Repugnant"" would be too kind a description. The editor and publisher of this tripe obviously did not read more than the last few pages, which were slightly better than all the preceeding ones, but which had nothing to do with the story! This book is a rip-off of the first magnitude.Any writing awards Brian Herbert has ever received should be revoked, with extreme prejudice.The only good thing about this book was: reading it in bed could put me to sleep almost instantly."
1,Frank Herbert is turning over in his grave.,"Dear Mr. Brian Herbert,Create a line of Dune toys. Put them on cereal boxes. Do what you need to milk your dad's genius. But please stop. Just stop. Stop writing anything remotely related to Dune; unless, of course, your promise of not writing anything anymore remotely related to Dune. Thank you.Sincerely,P."
1,Omnius and Erasmus NO!,"I almost collapsed when Omnius and Erasmus popped up at the end of this thing. They have the character depth of Shredder and Krang.Honestly, I was managing to tolerate this book until these fools were revealed. Yeah, I'm sure Frank Herbert imagined Daniel and Marty as being two slapstick robots who like to dress up like old people. Brilliant!"
4,Great book,"I felt all the first 6 books in the Dune series and Sandworms of Dune were great. Of course I loved some more than the others. While this book was definitely a great read, I felt too much happened in this series. While I have to admit it may be partially due to the fact that I didn't want the series to end, I feel the storyline in the book would have been better written into two or three books. Nonetheless, I will still highly recommend it. I also think that after reading this book it will kindle your interest in some of the prequels to Dune."
4,Imitation is the sinceres form of flattery,"I loved the book though he is not his father he does try, The book was an easy read and i know Dune fans will like it i highly recommend it, I cant wait for the next one."
2,Peace Be With You Always,"This book was okay, but in this hermit crab's view it would have been much better if there weren't so many books to keep track of. After all, this is the 13th book in the series and it still won't end even after the next one! Any series that takes that many books to get the author's point across should be shortened and makes this hermit crab wonder: Is it true that these authors could possibly be using this series to make money, so they can get their own series going? Just a thought! Anyways, with this being said, this book does tie in all the other 12 (!) books together nicely, and i'll read the next one to see how the series ends, but the Paul of Dune trilogy will most definitely be skipped. P.S.: Nobody has mentioned that this story is basically a rehash of the other 12 (!) books in the series, although it was good to see some old friends again. I guess that makes it worth a read, if nothing else. Peace be with you always!"
5,A very good book.,"I liked the book a whole hell of a lot but despite that there were faults. Mainly was Frank Herbert originally intending anything to do with the Butlerian Jihad? I am willing to say that he was considering he was planning on writing a book(s) with his son on the Butlerian Jihad and the notes supposedly did reveal a ""great surprise"". I do not know for sure but I will give Brian and Kevin the benefit of the doubt."
5,Die hard Dune Fan,"For years i'm enjoy reading the Dune saga, the last book of itis Chapterhouse, i was kind of confused when i finish that book,Hunters of Dune fill all the gaps and explore an endless numberof scenarios, i'm waiting in suspense for the next book!!!"
4,Long awaited sequel to Chapterhose Dune,"The Dune Saga continues with the voices of Brian Herbert and Kevin J Anderson. The writing style is the same as in Prelude to Dune and Legends of Dune. The story continues with the various factions preparing for a final battle, and this isn't the last boook, the saga continues in Sandworms of Dune. A must for Dune fans."
2,Better than the Prequels,"I sort-of read all of the prequels as they came out. I got bored and skipped a lot of the descriptive sections. Then I forgot about Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson until I happened to come across them in the public library the other day. Chapterhouse is/was/will be my most re-read book in the Dune series. I've been waiting to find out who Daniel and Marty were for 15 years since I first read the entire series over the course of weeks. This book... well, I didn't skip a paragraph. No, it wasn't Frank Herbert. You could see through the writing far too often. But I never got bored."
4,Hunters of Dune,"Very satisfying for fans of the Dune series with interesting plot twists and, of course, a cliffhanger to the next novel Sandworms of Dune"
4,Ready to Continue...,"Other than the bad cliffhanger ending, a good read in the series. Now, a query of the authors: you have given us the back story of most people and/or groups in the Dune series, all except for the history of the Bene Gesserit. As we follow them into the future, it would be great to somehow learn how on earth Serena Butler's consciousness entered the good witches' timeline -- I don't recall any reference to the Sisterhood in that volume. Just for instance.Of course, I'm waiting for the next book in the series."
3,Hunters of Dune,I feel sure that anyone who is a fan of Frank Herbert and his Dune series will appreciate this book. Although it lacks the depth of the original series. It makes up for this with the pure enjoyment of revisiting this great saga and for me some of my favorite characters in any fiction. I think they have done an amazing job considering the size of the shoes they've had to step into. I'm looking forward to more.D.L. GravesSan Francisco
2,Fun but weak,"Since I love the Dune Universe I was very excited to read the book and discover what happens to my favorite characters, but I had some problems with it.The book is very predictable and has none of the intrigue or surprises of the orginals. I loved Frank Herbert's complicated characters and far reaching storylines. This new series suffers from predictablity and rather bland writing. I know I will continue to read the series but I do not give this a high recommendation."
1,Please let it be over....,"Well I did it again. I had promised myself that i wouldn't waste my time or money on another bastardization of Frank Herbert's work. Each of the ""new"" Dune novels had left me with a progressively worse taste in my mouth. Frank Herberts novels were a study in subtlety, you were forced to THINK about what he wrote. His characters had dimension, they FELT real. Frank Herberts novels were a 7 course meal. The New Dune books are bubble gum by comparison. I almost named my son Duncan...I'm serious. I'm sooo glad I didn't. If there's anyone out there with some talent and a love of the Dune universe, please write a book! I swear on my Frank Miller Wolverine miniseries that I will not buy another Novel that has ""Brian Herbert"" on the cover. On another note, what do you think about starting an on-line fund raiser to pay James Cameron to make Chapterhouse?"
2,Predictable and transparent,"I have enjoyed the Dune series but this was a disappointing read. I'm not sure why the authors felt the need to tie everything up in a neat little package. Since when did Science Fiction stories have to end ""happily ever after?"" Frank Herbert may have left notes in a safe deposit box for a reason ...maybe he never intended them to see the light of day.Read this if you've read all the other Dune books, but don't set your expectations too high."
3,"Gholas, gholas, everywhere....","I enjoyed this book, a lot more than I expected to, but that was mainly because I went into it with such greatly diminished expectations. I still want to see the original outline, however (in Frank's handwriting), because I'm still not entirely convinced that this was the way he envisioned it. The profusion of gholas is an extraordinarily heavy-handed use of a plot device that reeks of KJA's influence (recall all the infamous superweapons he introduced into the Star Wars universe).Still, their attempt to unite all the story elements from the prequels up to the present novel is quite brave. It gives me a very different and not entirely unwelcome perspective on the Dune Chronicles. Not that you couldn't have seen it coming from a mile away, however. Great ideas, somewhat clumsily executed, but what else is new for this pair. I'll be waiting to see how they wrap it all up next year."
2,Huge Disappointment,I don't know what else to say other than i felt taken advantage of after reading this book. Everybody knows that FH never intended Marty and Daniel to be the lame robot characters from the crappy prequels. FH would turn over in his grave. All the characters are cliched and one dimensional if anything people will read these out of sheer nostalgia.
2,Not Frank Herbert's Dune...,"I won't try and improve on the several thoughtful reviews that preceed mine. This book in entertaining in the same way a comic book is entertaining. It is all exposition and the characters are like card board cutouts. Brian and Kevin - I have read every Frank Herbert novel, most of them three and four times. Gentlemen, you are not Frank Herbert. I for one would appreciate it if Brian would stop kicking his father's bloated corpse down the beach, and try and make it on his own."
1,Huge Disappointment,"I was very excited when I learned of Hunters of Dune, a sequel to Chapterhouse Dune, and that it would be based on outlines and previous writtings by the orginally writer. However, as soon as I started reading Hunters of Dune I immediately noticed a major change in the language. In previous Dune books, the language was intelligent and thought provoking, a thought within a thought within a thought so to speak. But in the new book the language attempts to meaninglessly impress for no appearent reason, and accumulates with an impression of shallowness. I literally got bored reading this book. Regardless of the fact it continued a story line of a book series I admire, periodically reread, and suggest often to friends. About a third of the way through I decided I wouldn't finish the book due to the bad writting, it was a very poor imitation, and the unfolding story that was ... just boring."
3,"OK, but not in the same league as Daddy Frank's work","This is the first of the Dune books by Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson that I have read. It's an OK read, which continues the story from Chapterhouse Dune, and leaves the stage set for the suposedly Final episode to follow. However, any reader who is closely familiar with the original Dune series by Frank Herbert will recognize that this book is nowhwere near the same quality of work. They give it a good try, but there's just no substitute for the genuine article."
3,Predictable,"I think the single word used in the title says it all. It was fairly obvious to me, even back in ""Sandworms"", how Duncan Idaho's role was going to play out. It's bad when you can see it coming that far away. Oh, and tell me how Duncan Idaho makes sense? He's a ghola, not the product of some Bene Gesserit breeding program. I really hoped what I saw coming wouldn't be, but it was. Very predictable, and very disappointing.That being said, I gave it three stars (instead of two) because it does sort of finish off the story where Chapterhouse left off. Speaking of Chapterhouse, if you haven't read it, or it's been a while, you might want to start there. It will help."
1,"Terrible, unredeeming","When I first heard that BH/KJA were writing Dune 7 based off some notes they claim to have found, I was all excited. Like any Dune fan after reading 'Chapterhouse Dune', I was left wanting more. I patiently read the Butlerian Jihad and Royal House trilogies, feeling disappointed in both and impatient for them to write Dune 7 already.Alas, this book was better off not written at all. I slogged through it, patiently reading about the struggle between the Bene Gesserit and the Honored Matres, the drama between the gholas on the Ithaca, Duncan Idaho struggling with his addiction, Sheeana trying to figure out her destiny, some drama from the Face Dancers, and a whole bunch of other junk. And then I came to the end of this book. What? After all that drama and meaningless action I have to wait for another book? I was hoping that Dune 7 would be better than the two trilogies penned by Brian and Kevin, but alas. This book holds NOTHING of the essence of Frank Herbert's Dune."
3,it's okay,"i haven't had time to read it completely yet,but it looks okay.Good that the writters remind us of past stories in the previous books.Lettertype was a bit small,but that's because it was a pocket edition.I like the cover art well !"
4,Hunters of Dune (Audio book on CD),"I anxiously waited for this one to come out. Story surprised me, but it did begin to close some of the loose ends created by the earlier books in the series. I was a little disappointed by some of the plot twists and couple of the inconsistencies made me wonder if Brian read the other books and just forgot. I hope the finale is is a little cleaner. I will say that after reading the book, the audio book really enhances the story. Hearing the characters conversations cleared up a couple of questions but also raises others.All in all a good read and listen."
1,Why are Earth Based Religions used in a Dune Universe,"Why the odd introduction of an Earth based religious entity. Really: Karbala, Judaism Rabbis, Martyrdom are out of place in a fictional Dune universe. Other than promotion, why?"
1,IT IS ALL A LIE!!!,"It is not complicated to see why ""Hunters"" and ""Sandworms"" are awful sequels. It's based at least half on the novels of BH+KJ, not wholly on F.B.'s. Plus, I thought it pretty obvious that the elderly couple were a highly evoled species of Face Dancers. That most likey was the true threat to humanity. What you need to realize is that Face Dancers are just another form of A.I.. The Robots were never really intended to be a threat. From what I can gather, according to interveiws and early writings, the real ""ancient enemy"" were humans using machines to enslave other people. Then there was a religous revolt, stated in the books. SCIENCE VERSUS FAITH. Face Dancers v.s. a new free humanity."
2,539 pages for what,"I waited until Sandworms came out to read this book so I wouldn't have too long to wait for the end.In the end did it matter, no.At 539 pages this book was about 480 pages too long. In the end nothing of benefit happened. How can they write a book this long without any sort of conclusion?There is nothing in this book that couldn't have been covered by a prologue in the next book. In the last 5 pages they summed up 15000 years of the enemy, had they done this with the other plotlines we would have had a lot more time on our hands to read something with a point, or maybe that was refreshing.Skip and hope Sandworms references this book, just as this referenced the other 12 at great length."
3,Not Great but a good read.,"If you have followed the series of new books you already know the outcome. The foreshadowing in the last trilogy that was repeated over and over pretty much comes true in this one. While I look forward to reading the next one I don't believe that the treatment of the two mysterious characters at the end of Chapterhouse were dealt with to my satisifaction. It fits nicely into the new story line but not into Frank's origional story line.I found that most of this book contains filler bringing the reader up to date with characters from the origional series. A single novel could have most likely been written.After the publishing of the last book I would love to see the notes be made available some how so we can judge for ourselves what Frank had intended.Bottom line, if you've enjoyed the new series you will like this book."
2,Brian is not his father,"Frank writes at a college level and Brian writes at a middle school level. I was glad the story continued, but if you're looking for the genius of the first 6 books to continue you can forget it. This book is not particularly insightful, philosophical, subtle, clever, or captivating. It's the backup qb that tries to finish the game, or rather not lose it. Things get even more painful in the second book, but all that being said, I'm glad I read them because I love this story more than any other I've ever read."
5,Can't wait for the next one!,Excellent read.I can not wait for the next 2 books to come out.Will be an excellent conclusion to the series.
5,Blown Away!,I know that there are alot of people worried about the legacy of Frank Herbert. After reading this book I am not worried about it in the least. The story is still going and getting better along the way. If you are just getting into the Dune Universe I would read the orginals and possibly the other prequels done by Brian and Kevin. I think they did an awesome job of (starting to) bring this epic story to its conclusion. Highly recommended! Read this book!
1,Just want to know how it ends.,"I suffered through this book just to get to the end of the overall story. It's generally not a good thing when a non-writer is thinking of better sub-plots, while reading, than the author has come up with. All the characters and factions have lost the richness and depth that was in the original stories. I wasn't expecting him to live up to his father's standards, but this falls short of all my standards aside from correct spelling and grammar. I have never seen such bad execution of a good story."
1,"See Paul Run, See Paul Fall Down","Forgetting the original series, there is absolutely no character development at all. Therefore, this is much like reading a primer that should be labeled ""kiddies of dune""...slow, repetitious, pedantic. But the reality is that this book doesn't just fail on its own. The original series was ""an existential metaphore that told a story about the human condition."" But nothing can be learned from any of the utterly unrealistic and irrational characters in this book. Therefore, the failure of this attempt is infinately greater not because it fails to live up to the vision of Frank Herbert, but because it fails to even try."
1,Let me try again,"The prequels of Herbert and Anderson are truly an abomination in the Dune universe. They remind me of the start of the movie ""The Player"" where the camera is panning around a film studio listening in at potentai movie pitches and you hear stuff like ""The Graduate...Part2"" - because true Art can't be improved on - especially by men of lesser abilities.The sweep and grandure of the original Dune novel is utterly lost in the terrible writing style of Herbert and Anderson. And their most unforgivable sin ( amongst many ) is the relentless repetion of the plot lines because they assume their readers are stupid.Frank never assumed that. And that's why Dune and Dune Messiah endure and all the post Frank Herbert sequels pale under any comparision.Not sure what happened to my earlier reviews of this book and of House Atriedes, so I am putting in my two cents worth again, back on the side of the real fans."
2,You can skip this one.,"Hunters of Dune is supposed to bridge the gap between Chapterhouse Dune and Sandworms of Dune. It is a simple, repetitious, mind numbing story line with no suspense or surprise. There is no reason to read this story, unless you are going to read Sandworms of Dune. And if you do read Sandworms of Dune, there are enough references in it to the events of Hunters of Dune that reading Hunters is superfluous. If you are a Dune addict, and must endure every word to find out how the series ends, then read Hunters of Dune followed by Sandworms of Dune. If you just want to find out how things wind up, skip Hunters and just read Sandworms. If you aren't a big Dune fan, skip both."
3,Not exactly Frank Herbert quality...but,Somewhat enjoyable and leaves you wondering what will happen in the next book.
2,Dunesploitation,"Reading the last true Dune novels was a challenge for me. As a non-native English reader the concepts and ideas were difficult to muddle trough. But I plowed on, because the inventiveness and surprises kept it worth while. This book (Why is it called ""Hunters"" anyway? And who are the soldiers on the cover?) does not provoke thought. It is basically fan-fiction, no new concepts or characters are introduced. Indeed, rather than injecting some badly needed fresh blood into the storyline by introducing a new major character, some are brought back from the dead. Resulting in the ludicrous situation of 4-year olds holding hands because they were lovers in a previous life... It does not bode well for the next novel."
4,Worth Reading,"If you are a fan of Dune you will like this book very much. I couldn't give it 5-stars (reserved for the original along with Heretics and Chapterhouse). The story is a little too fragmented in that the story could have evolved into 1 1/2 - 2 books; however, it is well worth the read.The Butlerian Jihad through the Battle of Corrin would rank 4.5. Nevertheless, it works as a part of the Dune saga and I very much look forward to Sandworms of Dune to see what Norma has cooked up for The Enemy..."
1,Hunters of Dung Worst Book Ever,The book deserves about a minus 10 stars.This is clearly the worse book ever. The book recounts events that take over a time period of about 35 years and make them seem like eons. Nothing takes place in the book. Most of the characters are murderous thugs who spend their time torturing each other. There is no plot and the characters are boring. There worse of it is the authors bring some of the most interesting characters in literary history and turn then into cardboard cutouts. Most of the book has scenes that involve pointless torture or people doing nothing.Again this is the worst book ever.
2,A little disappointing.,"A lot of information is diseminated during this tale that leads the reader to look forward to some kind of climax. It never happens. It's basically unsatisfying and is a shameless cliff hanger. Do not read this book unless you already plan on reading Sandworms of Dune. The writing itself is just, OK, not lacking flow or rhythm, but void of the vivid imaging that was the trademark of Frank Herbert.I haven't read Sandworms yet, but intend to. So I can't just write this novel off as a waste of time, as I'm certain it is a necessary primer for it's sequel."
3,overly predictable,"This spells out the outline given by Frank Herbert and unfortunately reads that way. What I mean is things happen just like they are planned every time! Not a single battle won by the underdog or a single plan surprisingly thwarted. I guess the authors are trying to stay loyal to whatever outline they have. But I wish they would ahve more fun with it and do more with the meat they need to put on the bones.It also goes into too much lengthy explanations of the dune world. Have fun with the novels guys! If purists want just what Frank Herbert wrote then publish the exact outline later. I get the sense Frank did allot of innovating after the outline was done. I hope these guys do too in the next book.I give it three stars because 1)I am glad they wrote it and fill us in what Frank had in mind. and 2) they aren't all bad, and I can sort of understand why they are not going to far out of bounds from the outline - even though I disagree with that decision."
2,"looking forward to a better ""Dune"" book next year...","I first read Frank Herbert's ""Dune"" back in high school back in the 1980s, and loved every chapter. The following books were also quite good, and I savored each novel to its fullest.The concept Brian Herbert develops here is good, and its conclusion is okay. I think Brian could have made two (maybe more) tightly-novels from this, concluding with his ideas from ""Sandworms of Dune"". But now it will only be two books; ""Sandworms of Dune"" is scheduled to be released in August 2008.The ""Dune"" legacy deserves a conclusion that rates better than ""okay"". Please don't disappoint me; I'm looking forward to relishing the final chronicles of ""Dune""!"
4,Amazing history of Dune,"They are really good history on how the world of Dune, Great houses, Bene Geserit, and Mentat are started. However I still like the way Frank Herbert writes :p"
2,"not fizzy, few bubbles, very soapy scent","the smell of this actually made me sneeze. it's kind of a sharp, soapy smell. the kids loved the dolphin on the package but the ""sands"" are not great ultimately."
4,Great watch!,"I brought this Skagen watch 2 weeks back and it looks great as seen in the picture. It is very light in weight and comfortable to wear. Till now i did not get any scratches on the glass and it looks tough. The only problem i see is, my watch has a very very light layer of mist like thing on one half of the glass. I think it is inside... because i wiped it with soft clean cloth many times but did not vanish. It can be seen only if you examine it closely."
5,My awesome watch!!!!!!!,"This is one of the best watches I've ever owned,and I've owned dozens of watches including various Movados and other fine watches. I have thoroughly enjoyed the look and feel of this fine timepiece; I hardly know I'm wearing it, it's so light. I need reading glasses to tell time on most watches but with this one I see the time clearly and that is a huge plus. I am going to order other variations of this watch so I can change it up now and then. Thanks for such a great piece of jewelry at such a great price!"
4,Beautiful!,"We love this watch...purchased it last year, however, my friend lost it...we liked it so much that I had to buy another one this year for him! My girlfriend liked it so much she purchased one for her husband and last year, after seeing mine she bought one for her daughter!"
2,Men's??? Check Skagen Website...,"I was double checking the details on these Skagen watches since Amazon does make mistakes, sometimes. After trying to find this watch and see if its worth buying, I found it wasnt in the men's collection but in the women's. So if you think it looks good, feel free to buy it. Overall, Skagen watches are great. I already bought 2 slimline watches, and thinking of buying another."
1,net,well net came and it looked good so a couple of days went shrimping so on using the netit was tering not wourth the money very poor
1,Poor performances and sound,"The performances were lackluster, the first venue and performance was like watching a local (no offence intended for local bands)band practicing in their garage.Very low quality sound through out."
5,THE Best ELO DVD,"I was on a search for ""Out of the Blue"" on DVD and discovered it on Amazon. At the same time, I purchased ELO ""The Early Years"" on a whim. The sound quality is excellent and it truly does take you back to before their Laser & Spaceship Concerts. I have been a fan of Jeff Lynne & ELO and have seen them in concert numerous times. It will bring back memories of great music."
5,Electric Light Orchestra -Live: The Early Years,"It was great to have this video remastered to DVD properly great sound and I couldn't find this CD anywhere else Thanks again Amazon, my favorite place to shop GREAT products, fast shipping and packaging, fantastic prices overall I see Amazon unbeatable, compared to other related sites."
2,Okay I Guess,"I thought this was going to be ELO in concert recently but it is from the seventies. If you like the basic sound with out all the big sounds of a concert, then you would like this. I like the big stage show with powerful sounds."
4,Warning: This will keep you awake at night,"A readable and scary review of Strauss' philosophy and how it influences neo-conservative thoughts and actions. I could not put it down.It is hard to believe this was written in 1999. It is consistent with everything we have seen and suspected since the 2000 election. What we see today in the missing John Roberts documents. Yesterday in the Downing Street memos. And tomorrow in ...Do you wonder why Jewish and Catholic neo-cons support a born-again President? Why born-again evangelicals support Israel? Because the philosopy of Strauss is for only a few chosen individuals to be educated and know what is going on, to lie to the rest of us, and to use religion (any religion will do) as a vehicle to rally the masses."
1,Failed Critique borders on the ridiculous,A simply terrible book. Caricature is not a sufficient refutation. Be very careful of any assertions in this book: always follow up the footnotes and compare and contrast the massive difference between what Strauss says and what Drury makes Strauss say. Another strategy employed is that of guilt by association. This book has no redeeming features.
1,A Sad Commentary,"This work is a sad commmentary on what passes for scholarship these days. Anyone even fairly acquainted with Strauss' works will see that this is nothing better than journalistic ire served up as objectivity. Indeed, if one were to read all works with the closed-mindedness that apparently Ms. Drury brought to Strauss' works, most would fail, and certainly these would include Ms. Drury's heroes of the academic Left. At the very least, obscurantism was not manifest in any of Strauss' books. There are fairer and more informed critics of Straussian theory to turn to without indulging in this paragon of conspiracy theory."
3,"Work well, but too expensive","This is a great fertilizer tab for use with planted aquariums (growing live aquatic plants); Products like this are a must if you're using inert substrate (gravel, sand, or blasting grit). I used these Flourish Tabs and had good results: All my root-feeding plants perked up.HOWEVER, the reason I say 3 stars out of 5 is because of the price!! For how tiny these tabs are, they are way too expensive for me. I have a 72 gallon bowfront tank and I can't possibly afford this name-brand product long term. ++whisper++ I'll tell you what I use instead....I buy this product:Size ""OO"" Empty gel capsules (1,000 qty)http://amzn.com/B002R3JJ8Wand fill it with this product:Osmocote 2722501 Outdoor & Indoor Smart-Release Plant Foodhttp://amzn.com/B001M5AFKW... bury it completely to the bottom of your substrate and you get a decent root tab fertilizer for about 1:100th the cost. ++wink++"
1,VERY REPETITIVE,"Listened to the sample in a store...sounded good. Got it home and all the songs began to sound alike. :( It says it goes up to addition and subtraction to 18, but I thought it would be math facts like 18+18=36. What they mean is that the facts do not add past 18. Overall disappointing."
3,"Practical, but hard to read in a pinch","Although this book is informative and contains information you need to know in a wilderness medical situation, it would be difficult to find what you need in a pinch because the type font that was used is very small and narrow. My guess is that this is due to the cost of publishing a thicker book that would be necessary with a larger type font; but by saving the space and cost of printing, the price for the reader is that it is more difficult to find and read the information that you might need in a hurry. Also, there are no tabs to indicate different medical situations, which would really help. My advice to those who DO buy this book is to read it thoroughly before going out on the trail--don't wait until you really need it in a medical emergency."
3,Fresh New Powers & Character Options,I've seen this book several years ago. More powers and character types than the Hulk can shake his big green fist at. Sometimes gets bogged down with unnecassry details. I would not follow the entire character creation process--just use it as a jumping off point. Can even provide fresh ideas for those using other super hero role playing games.
1,Not Happy,"I wore this bathing suit twice and the wire started coming out of the bathing suit top. It was only $7.00, so I guess you could say I got my moneys worth."
3,Excellent Information despite flawed conclusion,"I had a tough time rating this book as it has a flawed conclusion that changes the entire message of the book. The author of the Foreword is the main reason for this flawed conclusion of the great cataclysm occurring 11,500 years ago which is when he suggests we went through the galactic equator plane. This is patently FALSE as prooved by the book ""Galactic Alignment"" by Jenkins, as we are going through the Galactic Equator Plane in the 2000-2012 time period NOW. I rated it three stars and considered giving it 4 stars cuz of the good information that can be gleaned from this book. It does establish that a catastrophe does happen every 30 milllion years like clockwork due to the earth going through the galactic equator plane 8 times in a galactic year of 240 million years. Yes this book is a keeper, even with the flawed conclusion that we have already had the great catastrophe 11,500 years ago when we are about to experience it in 2012."
5,For Families Of Children With Special Needs,"Every family of a child with special needs should hear this wonderful album! The songs are very soothing to the child and parents alike. Shiana's soft, clear voice has a calming, peaceful effect on everyone who listens. More profound are the words themselves. My favorite song is ""How could Anyone"". For those who have a child with special needs, the words in this song will ring true and touch your heart deeply! This is one of those albums that will bring you much joy (along with a few tears) and maybe even give you a new perspective on your own life. It is an album you will CHERISH!"
5,Comforting for your inner child!,Shaina Noll has a beautifully soothing and loving voice. The music she recorded here was first sung to her own children. I have a healing practice and occasionally use this music in a healing session. It always evokes a feeling of being loved and comforted.
2,There are plenty of better options out there,"There is much to be missed in the song titles and review here. This disk is a bit over the top, lyrically and musically. There are lots of religious overtones and references to God, which for better or for worse, is not mentioned in the description or reviews. There is an Enya-esque quality here without the professionalism. For this type of product, there are plenty of better choices."
4,Blade Chisel,The product was delivered well packed and in perfect conditions. I had already used it in some hardwodd work and it had worked quite fairly.
3,Beginner's set,"Try as I might there is no detail on the type of steel used or the bevel angle. So I took a gamble with nearly 50% off here on Amazon. Shipping was prompt, they seemed new in packaging, but upon closer inspection their edges were chipped, bent, and there were scratches all over the face. The 1/2"" chisel bevel wasn't even square! The machining lines were quite horrific and would take hours honing to reveal a smooth, flat surface. I just couldn't think to waste that much time on mystery steel when I can get a 4-set of Narex chisels for the same $26. That being said, I was tempted to keep them just as a beater set for rough-joinery in larger planks or beams.... but I didn't."
2,A very deceiving title!,"I am an avid reader, and am, in general, open to most styles and opinions. This book was suposed to be a book about Irish suspense; it should really come with a warning ""read only if you are of the Unionist/Loyalist mindset."" If you are of this mindset, then you will enjoy it. I could not finish it due to the Unionist mindset that infers that everything Irish is inferior; and, of course, everything English is superior."
4,Suspense and The Troubles,A fascinating book from beginning to end. Explores both The Troubles and issues that come up when you lose a parent as an adult. Suspenseful and surprising--it will keep you guessing until the end.
2,Disappointing Sports Wisdom,"After a fast start, the book fails to deliver the promised tidbits of sports wisdom and inspiration. As an American, it concentrates far too much on British sports and individual sports to hold the interest of kids who compete on US team sports such as hockey and baseball. Wholely unsatisfying."
1,Don't buy the Text/Workbook Package,"Even though this workbook has the option of being bundled with the textbook, don't buy them together. I needed the 3rd Edition, but ended up getting a 3rd edition textbook and 2nd edition workbook. Just buy them seperately and you'll be ok, just make sure you know what you're getting before you click buy."
1,Bad Combo Advice,"When I bought the Vis-a-Vis: Beginning French, the website offered a combination with its work book which I readily accepted. I admit it was my mistake that I didnt bother to check the edition of the Workbook. I ended up with 3rd Edition Vis-a-Vis Book (which I wanted) and 2nd Edition Workbook (which I didnt want). If the website hadnt offered the combo I would have been more careful and checked the edition. On top of that I was charges the return shipping cost too! The 3rd Edition is not available for 2-5 weeks which is useless for me then!"
1,I have not received my shipment yet. It's been a month!!!!!,I need your asssistance. I have not recieved my book yet. It has been more than a month. I need to contact the vendor.
4,Good Product,I like the gum (as well as the rest of the Smart Mouth line). My only complaint is the gum does lose taste rather quickly.
3,Smart Mouth gum,"The gum was a disappointment as compared to the exceptional mouthwash. I need to chew two pieces at once because they are small and not packed with much lasting taste. Also, I'm not a fan of chicklet-style gum."
2,He saved his better stuff for part 2,"on an accident I bought To Make God Famous, pt 2 first, and loved it, which inspired me to buy this one - I should have stuck with part two."
2,the clasp from hell,"the watch is beautiful, graceful, even elegant...BUT the clasp is designed by a designer who likes complexity. this has, as do all of the mesh bands, has the clasp from HELL!!!out of the box, it needed a manual to figure out...this the first warning sign. setting up to the wrist size was awkward and hard to do. then putting the watch on and hooking one mechanism over some rod is very hard, then there are more steps, each one a real challenge. then when i took my watch off, i must have pulled the wrong lever and zip the watch feel groundward. happy to say it ended up on the bed, for had it gone to the hard floor, i may be looking at a new crystal buying experience.an older person with hands no longer working well will find this watch impossible to put on and take off.i could never ever recommend this watch, not for it's looks, but just for the band and clasp...foolish foolish person who designed it!"
3,zero water resistance but pretty,"The Amazon description is incorrect I bought this watch for my wife and looking at the back there are no marking indicating any water resistance. As my wife is accustomed to wearing her watch all the time this is a problem. Even washing your hands will potentially end up with water in the watch, would not have purchased if I had known. But it looks very nice especially for the price if you can put up with zero water resistance."
5,Beautiful watch,"I bought this for myself to celebrate a milestone in my life and I couldn't be happier. Adusting the watch to fit my wrist was simple (contrary to one review - Skagen gives you easy, detailed instructions, but I figured it out before reading the instructions), and I'm already getting many compliments on it. It looks far more expensive than its price. And I love that the case is quite slim. Gorgeous watch!"
3,Watch Out,"This watch was brillant & shiney for about 3 months, then began to look dull & worn. I like the adjustable clasp because I need the extra length. The glass face hasn't scratched yet. It keeps excellent time, but I wish it would have kept it's shine for as long."
5,"Sturdy, high-quality product. Really happy with this purchase!","This same brand of bowl is also sold by LL Bean, but I think the two sizes they sell are bigger than this size. Our 15 lbs. terrier mix did not like to drink out of the heavy duty plastic water bowl that someone gave to us. After making do with a small kitchen stainless steel mixing bowl (which our dog kept tipping with his paw), we decided to buy a no-skid stainless steel pet bowl. I am really pleased with the quality--it is a solid, sturdy dish and our dog readily drinks from it. It does not skid, nor can our dog tip it. This 1.25 quart bowl is about 6-7 inches across and approx. 3 inches deep. Just right for smaller dogs. Thank you, Durapet and Amazon!"
4,Good but small for a 25# dog,The bowls are in brand new condition and look like they would work great but they are way too small! Be careful and make sure you know the size of the bowls you are looking at before purchasing. If they were the right size they would have been perfect!FYI: I have a 25lb Japanese Spitz and these bowls would not hold enough water for a couple of hours for him. I also have a 15lb cat and again they would not be big enough to hold his food and water for the day.
1,WARNING - Pure Garbage!!!,"The bowl is a nice size for a Labrador. It feels quite sturdy and it's good looking out of the box,- but it began RUSTING within a month. Don't waste your money if you intend to use it as a water bowl and expect it to last longer than a month! Too bad Amazon doesn't have an option for a zero rating - that's what it deserves."
2,Stinks,"The rubber base smells like janitorial perfume mixed with something foul and it remains after a thorough washing. Since a dog's sense of smell is so sensitive, eating from the bowl must be a little unpleasant. The stickers take forever to remove, and they're fairly big. Otherwise, it's a perfect dog bowl."
1,Horrible smell,"I too bought these and kept smelling something unusual. I think it must be the way they rubber is bonded to the steel. I am going to return if I can. I can't subject the cats to this awful smell. If I can smell it, you know it is worse for them. Liked the bowl otherwise. Too bad."
1,awful smell (not just bad),"I can't imagine how anybody could have developed a so-called pet food and water bowl that stinks this bad. It's the blue rubber thing on the bottom. It's probably the most ignorant product design I've seen. I tried finding Durapet online to give some feedback directly to the manufacturer, but just found people selling the stuff."
4,Solid construction,This is a very well made dog bowl that does a good job of not wondering around while our dogs are eating (nonslip bottom). We bought one of these and then bought another just like it when we got a second dog because we like it so much. We have had these bowls for a few years and they still look brand new. Holds about three cups of dried food.
1,Rusted and rotting,"Purchases May 3 and after a month it was rusty and starting to fall apart. I kept bowl outside but this should not happen to a stainless steel bowl, especially in such a small time period. Save your money"
5,Nice stainless finish with convenient rubber bottom,"Seems to be as good as a dog bowl can get - stainless steel that doesn't look like it will rust, and the rubber ring around the bottom is a nice touch that keeps the bowl from sliding and making noise when the dogs play with their bowls. The 2 quart is about an 8"" diameter."
4,"good bowl, good price","I bought similar bowls at Petco, and am now going to return them. While the Petco ones have rubber all across the bottom (this one is a 3/4 inch ring around the edge), the Petco ones are slightly lighter weight, and more expensive.These are a good weight, and don't have that annoying fingernail-on-chalkboard sound that some lighter weight metal bowls make. The rubber ring is rubbery, not plastic-y, so it does actually grip the floor.I am using this size (1.2 Pint) for food for my puppy. It may end up being too small/ having too much slop-over when she is full grown, but for now it's a good size for her, and probably will be for at least the next 6 months.I think the ""it stinks"" reviewer got a bad bowl; mine have absolutely no odor..."
5,State by J. Maritain,"An essencial reading for those who are still trying to understand (or getting less dummie) in the state's creation and functioning stuff, going through its origins, albeit under a specific point of view, in order to compare with other dense thinkers. I strongly recommend it."
4,Almost there,"Wicked book containing a face cutting serial killer, a black homosexual republican hit man and plenty of slain innocent children. While I usually don't even like crime novels I did find this one addicting and will definitely read the next book in the series (this being the first book of the Charlie Parker story).The book does however not qualify as great literature though it is very literate. The author simply spends to little energy on the people surrounding the main character. The story is also a bit too long, sometimes confusing and some of the side stories does not develop the characters nor the main plot and thus seams unnecessary.If the author had spend 6 more months it would have been a all time classic, because the pace, the literate qualities is all there - it is just not utilized enough. Anyway I did get swept away so I found myself to be quite forgiving."
4,Intense Reading!!,"I don't normally read much crime drama, but this book has turned me into a fan! Great plot twists, interesting and believeable characters, and a story that just won't quit. It was wonderfully gory and horrifying and I couldn't put it down. I am excited to read more of Connolly and see him advance as a writer."
3,"Strong debut, not for the faint of stomach!","Interesting, gruesome, violent story about Charlie ""Bird"" Parker, a New York cop who's life is destroyed by a creepy serial killer called the Traveling Man. I found the story to be very interesting, with a good plot and good characters. Some of the prose, however, was too dense for my taste. The description (in places) slowed the pace down and detracted from the tension. Thrillers need to move fairly steadily in order to keep the reader tightly-wound and this book slipped in a few spots.I do recommend it, though, to anyone who can stomach the violence! There are definitely some gruesome parts. (Such things don't bother me, but I realize that some are more sensitive.) A solid debut for a first novel (from an Irishman writing about the American South no less!).--David Montgomery, Mystery Ink"
4,Less would have been more,"If this was Connolly's fourth book, it would have been exceptional. As it's his first, it's staggering. The main characters are well drawn, especially Angel and Louis. But there are too many sub-characters and over and over again a name cropped up and I had to backtrack to find out who this person was. Also, the whodunnit part of the plot was obvious from a very early stage - I won't spoil it for those who haven't read it. But it was a bit of a movie cliche twist and I saw it coming a mile off. That said, this IS a good read. Grisly, exciting and at times darkly humorous (especially the dialogue between Louis and Angel). But a simpler plot would have made it more digestible."
3,Had The Potential To Be Great...But,"Every Dead Thing is a good first effort by John Connelly and it had the potential to be great. It has many of the elements loved by lovers of serial killer thrillers -- fast-pacing, murders and gore galore and lots of plot twists. However, my main fault with this book is that Connelly failed to develop his main character and key supporting characters well enough for me to feel that I really knew them and, as a result, I never cared enough about what happened to them. If this had been done more satisfactorily I definitely would have rated Every Dead Thing a ""5"". Connelly is an author with lots of potential and I look forward to his next book."
5,Darkly Brilliant,"Mr. Connolly's book is dark and haunting. Any person who cares for another will feel a horrifying fear of what can happen to those you love. The author's tale is, unfortunately, not so far fetched."
5,I've finally read them all,I could not find this one and finally ordered it. I really enjoy John Connolly's writing. If you have started on his books yet you are missing out. He writes well with a bit of the dark side. His characters are very well developed and he is on of those writters that once you start a book you better read fast because you won't be putting it down until it's done.
2,"Well researched, but way too dark","John Connolly did his homework before writing this novel, but it was way too dark and entirely too predictable. I had both murderers identified 1/3 of the way through the book. When I finally realized that I was correct in my suspicions about 1/2 way through the book, I stopped reading it. I hadn't been enjoying up to that point and saw no reason to continue."
2,Every Politically Correct Thing...,"...should be the title of this book. Won't waste your time telling the story again. Well-written, but painfully predictable and politically correct, complete with gay assassin and his lover, a thief, who help our hero battle ""evil."" I have spent time around criminals, and I don't recall any of them being particularly heroic. Very shallow and stereotypical view of the ""Deep South."" What else can one expect I guess, from an Irishman in Dublin writing about New York and Louisiana? Okay, if you can't find anything else to read..."
3,Every Dead Thing Review,This book had to many stories which distracted from the main theme. The buildup to the final conclusion was OK but the conclusion was terrible with no explanation as to why he did it etc. Hope his next book is better!
4,"Intelligent, exciting, great read","As soon as I finished this book, I logged onto to Amazon to see when his next book was coming out. Connolly has created great characters, a fascinating story, and in some amazing way takes his time telling it and at the same time makes it a page turner. It is intelligent, and assumes it's readers are also (very refreshing). Okay, so there are some gruesome moments, but really nothing worse than in Thomas Harris or Stephen King. (Also a much better book than Harris' last). It really keeps you guessing until the end. I thought I had it figured out, but then I started doubting it, and was never sure. LOVE THAT!So, because I'm brilliant, you should take my advice and read this book."
3,Needs a scapel,"A talented writer who seems to have squeezed two books together. Oddly disjointed. After a fast start, the book bogs down. Great atmosphere, but less would have been more."
2,long-winded and bloated.,"I had just finished one of Connolly's later books, ""Bad Men"", and saw this. Since it was his first book, I reasoned that this was the one in which he ""made his bones"" in the Crime/ Horror genre. Well, I can see evidence of the books to come in this, his first attempt. However, I found this to be a bit bloated and long-winded. No doubt Connolly wanted to show his ""chops"" and start strong but fell into the ""look how tormented I am"" school of florid and sometimes silly exposition and ""can you believe this?"" piling-on of gore upon gore. We get it, John! Unlikely scenarios are coupled with long-winded psychological babble from who else?: a foxy criminal ""profiler"", who, of course, is drawn to our ""tragic"" hero. If only...As I said, his later stuff is more finely drawn and much tighter than this. Try one of them."
4,"Haunting, Gory and Good","i'm glad I finally picked up this novel. Connolly creates a remarkably American novel, considering he lives in Ireland. He creates a violent, moody, atmospheric novel. This is not for the faint of heart. He creates some wonderful characters--most notably, Angel and Louis, the couple who happen to be criminals. The is probably too long, but the digressions aren't too bad. I figured out the killer (or had inkling), but still enjoyed it. His descriptions and ability to set mood are excellent. I'll read at least one more Charlie Parker novel."
2,A HARD TO FOLLOW THRILLER,"Charlie Parker is a former NYPD detective tormented by the murders of his wife and daughter. Charlie relives the murders by visions of their mutilated bodies.Charlie returns to the force to investigate new crimes, leading him to a psychic woman who explains the murders are the work of ""The Traveling Man"" and they are happening again.I could not finish this book. It has too many characters and the plot jumps around TOO MUCH. I will give the author credit for trying to create something original, but in the process created something hard to follow.The opening of the novel was enough to hold my attention, but after 100 pages I could not care what happened, and could not keep concentrated on the many characters, and various sub plots.Despite high critical acclaim, there are better serial killer novels out there.Nick Gonnella"
2,"Gratuitous gore, choppy abridgement - bad combination","Maybe it is better on the printed page, but the abridged tape of this Shamus First Novel winner left me cold. Maybe the editors chose to leave all of the gorey, grusome aspects of the book in the abridgement and deleted the ""normal"" stuff.In all events, my husband (a former policeman/army officer) didn't seem to mind the gore and maybe you won't either. It reminded me a great deal of some of the recent Cornwell efforts in terms of the kinky, bloody aspects.Still, we both found the taped abridgement to be choppy and confusing. One can only hope that the paper version lacks these problems."
2,not very good,Writing was not cohesive--had to think about the plot to follow. I won't buy another book by this author. Sorry.
3,Good read,Good read bit disjointed in its subplotsDisappointing endMay not read any more of his other novels for now
1,Unpleasant story about an unpleasant man.,"I like crime stories, and don't mind gore - but this one is just full of unnecessary violence that adds nothing to the story. Too many characters, too many story lines, and little indication where they would cross paths. I found the hero to be just an unpleasant person despite the sympathy one would assume would be generated by the tragedy he suffered. Put it aside after only a few chapters, which is not usual for me - generally I slog through to the bitter end."
3,Uneven at first; a roller-coaster through hell by the end.,"Despite a strong start, I quickly found myself getting bored with Connolly's attempt to create a world of characters that he could build a book series upon. The story starts with our hero attempting to find the murderer of his wife and child, but meanders far and wide before getting back on track in the final 50 pages. Despite my waning interest, the characters of Bird, Louis, Angel, and the mysterious, grisly psychopath ""Travelling Man"" kept me going until the satisfying, edge-of-my-seat ending. Uneven, but I will give connolly's next book a look. The guy has raw talent."
3,Aimless Merry Go Round,"I feel the book is a such a let down. Only the prologue was brilliant. The author introduces a plethora of characters until I lost count of who is who. Many times, I had to flip back to the previous chapters to get some background info on the character again. The many sub-stories introduced in the book (e.g. the hunt for Catherine Dementer, the killings of Joe Bones, etc.) do not seem to contribute to the main thread of the story. It's like being taken for a long ride to nowhere. I can only give credit to the amount of research put in by the author. He has raised my interest on the subject of flaying, especially the artworks that were mentioned in the book."
2,Not For The Squeamish,"Sometimes less is more. Connolly hammers the reader with so much violence and gore, that by the end of the book it is almost meaningless and the reader is numb. The plot line is unusual in that one mystery is solved only to flow into another. Although the writing is very good, I didn't find anything else in this story to recommend to others. Definitely not for the squeamish."
2,Tedious,"This book is a tedious read. The book starts promising: Bird's wife and daughter are brutally murdered and Bird (an ex-policeman and alcoholist) is (most of the time) busy finding the person who did it. The first 100 pages or so the book keeps you spellbound.Looks like a winner ... ? Well, eventually it is not. Bird keeps meeting many (too many) new characters page after page. He travels from place to place, with numerous flashbacks. The murderer is a real lunatic. He kills and strips the victims in various awful ways. But it is all too much ! This book is too complicated, and it lacks a real thrill. There is no focus. This book sure is a page-turner, in that way that you want to finish this book as soon as possible so you can read another, better one."
3,I'll Try the Next in the Series - But This Is NOT A Great Start,"The reviews for this and other Connolly books are fairly good, but I struggled to get through this one. FAR too many characters and converging story lines. Once he got back settled into tracking the Traveling Man, Connolly finished strong. I'll be back for more in the Parker series. Hopefully, after he painstakingly introduced so many characters - some of whom I imagine will appear in other books - Connolly's future books in the series are more about story telling and thrill rides."
4,Literature meets pulp,"Reading Connolly is a grisly gruesome experience yet he writes so well that his books would fit as well in the literature aisle as the mystery aisle. I know that is a bit of a nebulous criticism, but perhaps I can explain it better in another fashion. He writes page turners that do not read at all like a page turner. His vivid descriptions, and clever metaphors sound more like Jonathan Franzen than Thomas Harris. I like his Charlie Parker character and I plan to continue reading this talented writer. He is my wife's favorite author at the moment, and she thinks that all recovering alcoholics should read the series. She doesn't expect me to understand that statement until finishing book three, Killing Kind. I am not a recovering alcoholic, so I am not sure I will get what she means, but I plan to plow through and find out. By the way, my favorite author has the same last name spelled a bit differently."
4,"PS, GA",Just wore it to work today. Actually i had a hard time figuring out how to fasten it but looks nice.
2,Not as good as their past albums,"Very different from the Cranial Impalement and the SLG album which had Matti Way on Vocals, and Consume the Forsaken. It's faster and somewhat technical but I didn't dig it.The vocalist sucks. That pretty much sums it up.I wish they could at least re-do the album with Matti way's vocals. I'd probably buy THAT."
1,"Not the disgorge, i once liked...","Speaking from some one who has disgorge's other albums such as she lay gutted, consume the forsaken and their other works... I didnt like disgorge's ""parallels of infinite torture"" at all and i was very dissapointed because, i realy love this band but their previous materiels were actullie damn good but parallels isn't. From the first song to the last ? It gets old so quick. Disgorge ? If your read this ? Why you didnt sound brutal like in your previous efforts ? A let down fan. Step up your sounds next time !"
2,Okay for one viewing,"I got this as a Christmas gift for a friend who's been interested in Mini Coopers ever since the original model came out. Mistake. There is information about the origins of the car. Portions show like stock footage from an AutoWeek show. Some shots are repeated in different portions of the DVD. Lots of time devoted to scan shots of different meets, especially the 40th Anniversary. ""Stunning selection of images and photos"" doesn't seem accurate. All things considered, the price is too steep for what's offerred."
4,Let's be blatant,"You know there's something up when this DVD is being featured along with the one for The Italian Job re-make. Let's see, which extended commercial for Minis is more entertaining? The one that is blatantly a commercial or the one that treads on movie ground we've seen before in a slick marketing ploy to move Minis?Well, I gave the other one three stars!(wasn't that evil guy in Austin Powers called ""mini: something or other?"" Is there a connection there, as well?)"
5,Spa 56 Chlorinating Granules 2-lb.,"This is my second bottle purchase and it really works great. I use about a 1/2 cap of these granules every three days, and it keeps the water in almost perfect condition. I highly recommend this product for every spa owner."
5,Chlorine Granules,"Not Much to review here, it works or it doesn't.It this case the product was exactly as described."
3,Should be great,I really haven't used it yet. Hot tub started leaking before I could fill it up. The pool guy doesn't work on Vita Spectron kinds so it is sitting right now. The package did come quickly and well packed. I read the rave reviews and hopefully will get to enjoy the product some time this year.
1,NOT WHAT I ORDERED,"Just received this....yes it's black like I ordered but has a BIG PINK ""E"" in the center of the top...I did not order a YOGA outfit...what is with this??"
4,Essential 4 BB fans,"Tho not the 1st or best in-depth Beach Boys' bio (that's David Leaf's THE BEACH BOYS AND THE CALIFORNIA MYTH, 5 stars), Preiss's book is still compulsively readable, contains a ton of interviews & other material (some of it's new), & is livened up by many reprinted lyrics, & flashy art & photos ""illustrating"" the Boys' songs -- & also includes many photos from Guy Webster's originally-planned SMILE-insert booklet.There R few errors -- tho Preiss mis-identifies the vocalist on the SMILE track ""Do You Dig Worms."" Overall, this is a flashy package, with enuf substance & info on the band 2 make it worth the price. & U could do WAY worse -- U could read Steven Gaines' HEROES AND VILLAINS by mistake...."
3,Dead at Winterland,"A neat look back at a prominent group in their prime. I've never been a huge GD fan, but I do enjoy a lot of their stuff. It was fun to see them in their younger days. The concert was good, the sound quality good, and the video quality was pretty good for the technology at the time. If you're a Dead fan, this would probably rate a lot higher."
3,Don't Believe The Hype,"Deadheads are not known for their discretion, and the overwhelming praise for this DVD is a good case for that. First the good news. The sound remastering on this is excellent. Crisp. But it isn't the best show ever, even though Dick says so. And why were the Blues Brothers there? Please.Now, the worst part here is the video quality. The compression is terrible, and most of the video is blocky and pixelated. By far it is the worst video quality on a store bought DVD ever. It looks like a VCD in fact. Granted, there is a lot of black in the video, but this unacceptable.Given all that, it's still worthy of ownership."
1,TRY THIS,"Put this DVD on, do NOT smoke any pot, snort anything, drink anything, etc. Then tell me what you think."
2,Off key and poor graphics,"Donna sang off-key most of the time. I suppose that's what she really did in concert, or at least in this concert, but I don't think this was one of the Grateful Dead's best performances by any long shot.Also, the graphics were terrible and annoying. It looked like somebody took a typewriter and typed over the picture as it was playing. ""Happy New Year!"" Ok, we get the idea, now please take away that stupid graphic. The Grateful Dead graphic wasn't even lined up. In general, the graphics deterred from the program, at least for me.It was great to see Jerry and he obviously was enjoying himself, so that is a good thing, but overall, I wouldn't waste my time to watch this again."
4,Readily digestible Englih syntax for (non-) professionals,This book is really good for advanced learner of English as well as beginners in linguistic studies. Also it is a good desktop reference for language-teaching professionals because sometimes they need more linguistic insights of English grammar. Highly readable and recommendable.
1,Aweful,It's a massy Textbook. There are a lot of references written with a pen so that it is hard to concerntrate on while reading. Scraps everywhere.
3,"a classic, but not everyone's cup o tea","slightly improved song writing compared to his self titled album, but still not on par with the jazz fusion writing of his contemporaries (Zawinul, Shorter, Corea, Hancock, or even Pastorius at the time and since then Marcus Miller, etc). some great bass playing, a fun, funky spirit, but on the whole, sorta dull album if you prefer jazzier sounding fusion. maybe it's apples and oranges but i endlessly prefer the stuff Shorter and Zawinul were doing at that time. still an important bass record though."
1,"***** for the album, * for Amazon","I'll have to agree with ""D.Kushner"".. This is NOT the issue stated on the Amazon site. For me, the same thing happened, but the replacement, which again was the old issue, came FROM Amazon. So there's that, and the ""reissue of the jazz/funk drummer's 1976 album"" in the description.. As anyone who is trying to get the mythical 2008 release would know, Stanley Clarke is not a drummer. Five stars for the album, one star for Amazon."
2,Only if you want to see the roots of modern bass guitar,It was a very interesting record back in the '70s.Since that time the art of electric bass playing moved miles ahead and this album lost it's all attractivness.Remembering my impressions when I heard it at the time it was issued I bought CD as well - to my big dissapointment. It is boring now.
5,"The best, but not Jeff Beck, as previously thought...","I don't get why the confusion, but Jeff Beck is not on this album. However, John McLaughlin, the most advancing musician on the planet, does appear on acoustic guitar, not to mention Steve Gadd, Billy Cobham, etc. Imagine the best of the two best fusion groups of that time: Billy Cobham and John McLaughlin of the Mahavishnu Orchestra (although not appearing on the same track), as well as Steve Gadd and Stanley himself from Return To Forever. However, there seems to be a confusion about Chick Corea appearing on this disc. He doesn't.It's still one of the greatest fusion discs ever. Stanley is brilliant, not only in his playing, but in his leaving the opportunity for the other brilliant musicians to say their piece."
5,"come on, try it, you'll like it!","If you've never heard Girlyman, give them a listen. As a long-time fan of close harmony, I have to say that Girlyman sings some of the best I have ever heard! Take a cup full of Peter, Paul and Mary, throw in a spoonful of Simon and Garfunkel, a dash of CSNY, and top it all off with a liberal sprinkling of the Indigo Girls--and you get the taste of Girlyman. But beware, once you try it, you can't listen just once!The new album, Little Star, is simply an awe-inspiring follow-up to the first album, Remember Who I Am. The Gman sound has grown--even tighter, closer harmonies and seeking, insightful lyrics. The subtle densities of the instrumentations provide an able backdrop for the harmonies, but never obscure the lyrics."
5,Great music as always.,I saw Girlyman in concert with Dar Williams and let me tell you they stole the show...even though they weren't the mainliner band. I absolutely love this CD! It always give me chills to hear how well their voices harmonize. I'd definately love to see them again. You can't go wrong with this cd.
1,GREAT BLENDS,One of the best new folk/jass bands we have heard in a long time.Saw them recently on stage with the Indigo Girls and they were a wonderful compliment to the show. Great harmony !!!
3,great product,This came with everything I am so glad to get my lighter clear from all the wires and nnow my truck looks so much better great deal and made my interior neater!!
3,A reluctant 3 stars,"Ok it does what it is supposed to do. It's a wire, nothing to get excited about. It seems to me that $30 for a wire is a little, no a lot, excessive. For the price of the escort, especially the ""blue LED"" model, this wire should be included as standard installation and should be in the escort box as standard. It works as described, but that's like praising an extension cord because when you plug the lamp in, the bulb lights up. Unless you need a hard wired setup just use the coiled lighter plug. That way you'll disconnect the thing after you park and hopefully take it with you to avoid vandals smashing and grabbing."
5,great product,"very easy to install (comes with all the connectors) my radar detector is now permanently installed and does not use my cars cigarette lighter outlet, took less then 10 minutes to install very clear instructions"
4,Item not completely what I expected.,"Functionally, this item works perfectly and I am happy with it's operation. I don't feel it is described well by the manufacturer. I was able to find this item from Escort in two colors: Blue and Red.My corded adapter that came with my radar has a blue light for power and yellow for alert. So I would expect the direct wire ""Blue"" cord to have the same setup. Now apply that logic to this item, the ""Red"" direct wire cord. What I expected was red for power, and yellow for alert. However, this item is green for power and red for alert.The other indicators on my dash are a combination of red, blue, and yellow; no green anywhere. I would have ordered the ""Blue"" direct wire kit instead; had this item been described better."
4,good product,as advertized hides the wires. for those who cannot put up with clutter. will install another one on wifes vehicle
1,40 days with the enemy,I was sickened and repulsed by Dudman's treason and overt America bashing.He is a traitor and a coward and should be expelled to one of the communist states which he loves so well.
4,Very Good CD,"Gave it only 4 stars because I wouldn't consider some of the songs ""rock,"" but they are still all great choices. Not another generic CD with the same old tired 80's songs as all the others in my opinion."
5,Possibly the Greatest Collection of 80s hits ever produced.,"LEATHER AND LACE volume 2 in the GREATEST ROCK HITS OF THE 80'S is by far one of the best collections of 80's songs ever put together. With 80's greats like the Bangles, Laura Branigan, Pat Benatar and The Go-Go's, its a must for anyone looking to escape back in to the 80's music they remember."
5,"Arrr Matie, this be a good buy",This costume came to me just the way i had envisioned it and i looked better then the example photo of the costume. This was a good purchase and i would do it again.
4,Both fans and non-fans should seek this one out!,"1979's ""The Message is Love"" was Barry White's first release from his own Unlimited Gold label. The album is a mixture of the 70's White with a stab at moving into the new decade of the 80's.There is a greater dance influence in the first four tracks, but it's on the slower tracks where the singer/songwriter does his best work. ""Love Ain't Easy"", co-written by White and Paul Politi bears a unmistakeable similarity to White's successful cover of Billy Joel's ""Just the Way You Are."" Robert Jason's ""I'm on Fire"" is, perhaps in praise of White's then-wife Glodean.The best track, entitled ""I Found Love"", has a mid-tempo beat and is a find for White fans. Beginning with the trademark ""rap"", the song (that hints at a possible ménage a trois) allows both man and band to ""do their thing"".A gem like this one won't be found on a ""compilation"", and that, for his fans, is a travesty."
2,not a bad death album,"this was a disapointing album to me.i really don't know what it was,but i didn't like this band all that much."
5,Good Book,"Ok, my review might be a little biased as I know one of the authors(Doug) so bear with me. First is that Doug and Craig hit home on what it is like to be in your 20's and trying to figure life out. Second it is not written in a how to fashion, they give suggestions and insight on how to deal with this transitional phase in your life, but in the end your relationship with God is key. On a whole I would recommend this book to an Christian in his/her twenties or even non-Christians that want to see how Christians coup with life events."
5,My childhood favorite,"As a mother in her thirties, I can't wait to get a hold of a copy of this little story. I was read to often as a child and this was my all time favorite request. As soon as I learned to read, I read it over and over, the poor book was literally read to pieces. I hope it returns to print for a new generation of readers."
3,"Good book, but keep the intended audience in mind -","I had an opportunity to obtain this book at a function before it was available to the public. Ms. Chatzky also provided some very nice supplemental commentary to the delegates of this convention. I appreciate her approach; however, there is one point to keep in mind as you read this book: this book is for consumption by a populace that for the most part is financially illiterate. If you're a detail oriented person with some financial acumen, some of the suggestions made in this book will drive you crazy (i.e. paying your bills the day they come in). However, if money is controlling you instead of you controlling it, if you find yourself confused or bewildered by a myriad of options and not enough explanation, or you feel your financial life is simply out of control, then this is an excellent starting point to bringing some order to chaos."
5,Best financial book of the year!,"If you are like me, you have probably read and bought a lot of money books. But really, don't most of those other books pretty much say the same thing? I mean how many time can you talk about reducing debts, pay off your cc's invest in your 401 (k) etc., etc.With Chatsky's new book, you will hear about reducing debt but in a different way. You also hear about saving, investing and financial planning.I have been a fan of Jean Chatsky since reading Talking Money and have read her articles in Money magazine. In my opinion, she is the best of the female money guru's.You don't have to Rich is a book for the times and I highly recommend it for men and women who want to take control of their finances."
5,Excellent book that takes you back to the basics.,"The research conducted by the author on the impact of money on personal happiness is revealing and makes the book worthwhile. The author also talks about setting goals, a pre-requisite for success.. I enjoyed the author's perspective. Chatzky understands the value of intrinsic satisfaction and is not seduced by who has the most toys. After much reflection, I remain convinced that our goal in life is to make the most of the everpresent moment. So I recommend Optimal Thinking: How to be Your Best Self by Rosalene Glickman PhD as a companion to this book to arm you with the mental software to be your best, make the most of every situation and OPTIMIZE your financial life."
4,A solid read,"I stumbled on to this book at my local bookstore marked down from $24.00 to $6.00. After reading it I'm surprised to say I'd be willing to pay the initial amount! The author explains financial stability (I prefer the term ""stability"" instead of ""security""; wealthy people are secure, the less wealthy have to strive for stability) in a very lucid and rational tone. Straightforward with obvious sound advice it provided tibits of information to help each individual to define financial comfort and stability on their own terms. Thanks, Ms. Chatzky, for allowing me to not be as insecure anymore about my financial situation and about money in general!"
5,"Great! A quick, useful lesson in focusing your finances!","Two thumbs up!!Our entire family have been fans of Jean Chatzky's NBC Today appearances for several years. Her clear, plain-spoken approach to understanding and tackling financial challenges is once again on display with this latest book - which offers straightforward, practical advice on identifying and fixing the common problems that nearly all of us seem to share.Check out the website at www.payitdown.com. i use it as a good morning reminder that a simple, small and consistent effort can have a great big payoff!"
5,Excellent Book!,"I found the surveys very interesting, how people feel about money and happiness. More importantly, what habits happy people have regarding money. This book has some very practical advice. I liked this book so much, I'm giving it to each of my three adult children for Christmas."
3,Fair performance,"As with many of the SACD recordings, they seem to either be great recordings from the past, or, as in this case mid level up and coming players. There is nothing exciting nor uniquely brilliant about this performance. The players sound somewhat listless. The fidelity of the recording is excellent and the opus 49 trio is so great even a fair performance will sound good. Disappointed, but not heartbroken."
3,Just OK,If I wasnt a HUGE Rush fan I would have given this 2 stars.There is nothing new here.The interviews seem rushed (no pun intended) and there is no new vintage footage and you just KNOW they got it.Most of it is from Live in Rio concerts with some stuff from the other concert films.There is some Black and White footage and studio footage they provide but my old bootleg VHS tapes look and sound better!!! Dont know where all these 5 star ratings are coming from.Maybe the reviewers havnt heard all these stories before or seen the same old footage before?? I dunno but save your money and just get Beyond the Lighted Stage dvd (which I gave 5 stars as I love Rush!) Anyways-I wish I would have just rented this instead of buying it but I just couldnt resist.Hope this helps somebody out.......................
3,Rush: Classic Albums: 2112 & Moving Pictures,"I was not thrilled with this dvd. The band uses the same footage as their ""Beyond the lighted stage"" dvd and the interviews are almost identical too. On both album reviews, they left out the songs: The camera eye, Witch hunt, Vital signs,Lessons, Tears. They should have left out their brief life story(all this can be found on the Beyond the lighted Stage dvd) and concentrated on talking about EVERY song on both albums.I own other ""classic albums in review"" dvd's from other bands and they do go into all songs of that album in detail. The only thing that saved this dvd from getting one star from me is the bonus stuff. Rush is my favorite band of all times and I enjoy learning a little history about their songs. I just wished they include all songs when they decide to do another ""Classic Album"" dvd. Hemispheres and A Farewell to Kings would be awesome!"
1,Not what you expect,"I was hoping for some interesting footage from the 70s and 80s, perhaps even from the making of these records. Instead, it's just a bunch of recent interviews, some of which already appear in the recent documentary (which is WAY better than this)."
2,My favorite songs weren't even mentioned!,"Classic Albums should have treated 2112 and Moving Pictures as seperate features. No mention of ""The Camera Eye"", ""Witch Hunt"", or ""Vital Signs""!!!!!! The interviews are more of the same. I wish they went more in depth into the making of the albums. Maybe show more demonstrations solo on their instruments. Talked about gear used. What synths, amps, fx, guitars etc.... Meaning of the lyrics to those songs.Some of the bonus stuff is cool. Neil has some cool drumming footage. 2 stars for that."
4,Repetition and not all songs covered,"If you're looking for a song by song review of '2112' and 'Moving Pictures' you will be disappointed.Although 2112 (side A) as a concept album is discussed, side B is only briefly touched upon. (Something for nothing is covered in the 'extras'). Songs NOT covered are 'Lessons' and 'Tears'. Why wasn't Geddy asked about the lyrics for 'Tears'? since on this rare occasion he wrote the lyrics, not Neil?Same goes for Moving Pictures. Songs not covered are 'The Camera eye' (why not?), 'Witch Hunt' and 'Vital signs'. The first few minutes are a history of the band before '2112', which we have heard all before and it has been covered numerous times. Nothing new here. The two albums are squeezed into an hour. It's worth viewing but I expected more in depth track by track coverage of each track."
2,"Disappointed with ""creativity""","I purchased this dvd due to the great reviews. It seems like the instructor has ""classes"" that use creativity and modern music, however, this does not pertain to this video. It was a bit boring to me. My husband is a beginner and he could only perform the sun salutations at the beginning of the video. I was hoping to see many other poses not present on the video...I was bored within minutes as the repetition offered little new info with each series. It has some challenging postures but not impressed with the transition into these. The instructor should produce videos that reflect her true style if this is not it!!!!"
5,magnificent,"Tamara's Yoga Fusion is everything i want and need in my yoga practice. I am so thrilled to discover such a find. I highly recommend this excellent tool to use when needed. Practicing with Tamara is truly inspiring.Namaste,allyson"
2,What 70-ounce bowl? Is that how much it WEIGHS?!,"In the description for this bowl, it is indicated as a 70-oz. bowl. I can assure you that it does NOT hold 70 ounces of anything! Perhaps the description is referring to how much it WEIGHS, which is rather pointless, in my opinion! Realistically, the bowl will hold approximately 48 ounces of liquid. I was misled by the description, but will keep the pretty red bowl for other purposes than which it was originally intended."
1,Very Unhappy,"Great features on paper...But when you try to use it, you get an error message - I actually got the 40 GB unit. Looks like someone else had the same issue. Straight out of the box the unit will not power up properly.Customer service has been very responsive, but I am on my second replacement unit. I am having no luck with getting an actual working player ( even the guy I talked to in customer service said they were having many problems with this issue and my replacement unit would take a while to come out since they were waiting for a good batch from the factory). I live in a large city also so the FM transmit thing will probably not work well since most station frequencies are taken. Save your money . I am just glad I didn't shell out the $$ for the 80 gb unit."
1,Faulty from the start!!,"See above reviews and seriously reconsider. I have purchased one and it worked for nearly 8 hours while downloading music. Since then it won't even start. It has been sent back and returned....and the thing won't even start up. Support was very helpful at first, but when I called to report the returned product wasn't working...I was immediately fobbed off. Not even an attempt to walk me through any issues, just offering to 'let' me return it for a refund...that will take 2 weeks to refund.Wanted to avoid the IPod, but this waste of my time just convinces me that it's best to go with what you know."
1,Extremely Useless Book,I was very dissappointed in this book. I rec'd it for Christmas and actually asked my wife to send it back. It a pictoral of 'showrooms' (not garages) of the filthy rich. Cars that nobody but the owner can afford. Hardly a tool can be found.I was looking for a book that would help be design or build a very 'usable' functioning garage for the space I had.There is nothing normal or useful in this book.Sorry.
4,Good overall read,"This book was a good read, learning some history of the collector as well as the automobiles housed in these garages. Would have liked to seen more overall photos of the space, but was a great book to learn how cars can be considered pieces of artwork. These garages represent a passion for automobiles and Phil Berg captures it beautifully."
1,Ultimate Garages,"I got mine at a very steep price due at my request,just glancing through it is disappointing,I have the Author's C6 book which he was suppose to re-do and never did and was rude When I asked,never got a response.This book has hardly any Corvettes,Maybe a slight glimpse of two.(Don Sherman was interesting as is Brock Yates The Eliminator and Chevy V8 Midget )But it is all Foreign/Imported so-called Sports car Crowd Snobs,Porschephiles and ""Brass Era"" automobiles,not really a Gearhead but a Don't touch trailerqueen carowner's book."
1,not worth it,This book was really a waste of money. It was not very interesting and didn't really tell you much about the actual garages or collections.It also fell apart an hour into reading it.The form wouldn't process without me adding a star so I added the lowest I was allowed it actually isn't worth any!
1,Do not buy this tent!! -- 0 Star rating,"This is a poorly designed tent. The door screen and the door cover are zippered to each other instead of both being zippered to the tent. To make matters worse, the cover/screen combination is attached to the tent with a single zipper only, not a double zipper. To make matters DRASTICALLY worse, the zipper broke the second time I had the tent out. This left me no way to secure the front of the tent for the night. My daughter and I had no choice but to sleep in the tent with the door wide open with all the mosquitos. If someone introduced me to the person who designed this tent, I would punch them in the mouth. Maybe Eddie Bauer should stick to selling outdated clothing to yuppies."
5,Nice bag!,"This bag covers my Ibanez SGT120 perfectly. The bag is padded well enough for light use. The zipper appears to be well made and moves easily. Overall, this is a nice bag to protect your dread."
4,Good Gig Bag,"Not much to say about a basic bag. It fits a dreadnaught acoustic 6 string guitar, has good padding, and has a large front pouch for music and small (fairly flat) items like a tuner, winder or spare strings. Has a carry handle/strap, but no shoulder straps on the back as some others have. Seems well made."
4,Good for protecting from dust.,I purchased this for a hollow body electric that I have. When it first arrived I thought I had made a mistake and not gotten a big enough case but it does fit but with little room to spare. Altogether the case seems to be strong a durable.
5,Good protection.,Well built gig bag. Strong material and a good amount of padding. You won't get better protection outside of a hard case. And the price was right.
2,be carful about what you get,"i ordered these and was surprised by the shipping speed and the fact that the ones i got look NOTHING like the ones in the pictures. mine had a little blood on them, and no fur or attaching ribbon. they look more like sharpshooters trigger mitts. they have one finger set out from the rest. they are good for motorcycle rides as long as it's over 30 degrees, (i live in colorado). if it's under i need to wear my underarmor gloves too and then it's not bad, i start to get really cold after an hour or so of riding. my biggest complaint and the reason that i didn't give them 5 stars is that they don't at all resemble the ones pictured, they had blood spots, and weren't as warm as i'd hoped."
1,Doesn't Work,"I purchased this for my son for Christmas. It was delivered very quickly and was an excellent price. Unfortunately, the disc is damaged and it won't play. I will be contacting the seller to see about sending it back or replacing it. :("
5,Entertaining,Kids loved it (2 and 4). Was funny. And I don't believe any scary scenes. Would recommend to others with little kids who need to sit still for a bit :)
4,love it!,"Such a cute, classic movie. I loved this movie as a kid and I was pleased to find that I still enjoy it."
4,Lucked out,I found this at Walmart a few weeks back & it wasn't the proud price of $19.99 it was clearanced down to $13. I usually hold out & see if there are cheaper prices through Amazon to purchase such expensive movies. But to have this movie brand new & they day I saw it was awesome. All the animal characters are great enrichment to this classic film.
4,The Aristocats - a solid Disney classic,"The Aristocats is a warm, charming classic. It isn't as flashy as the newer films, but it's funny and entertaining, and unlike many other Disney pictures, isn't particularly frightening to sensitive children. The characters are colorful and fun, but like other older Disney films, there is some subtle, ""harmless"" ethnic stereotyping. Nevertheless it is a favorite and definitely deserves a place in every Disney collection."
5,Superb classic animation,"For Disney lovers or simply animation fans, this is a superb movie, as well as to any cinema admirer.The movie itself is very charming, and it has comedy and fun in the right proportion, including the magic romance beteween the sofisticated cat lady high class Duchess and the O'Malley street smart cat. The kittens come along with their inocence and childhood.Do not wait much to get this wonderful movie in your dvd collection."
4,Charmingly fun Disney movie,"Cats, kittens, dogs, and music -- a simple film kids will love. Horrified that his mistress's will leaves everything to her cats, the butler ""kidnaps"" Madame the cat and her kittens, and drops them off in the remote countryside so he can claim his mistress's fortune as his. Madame, with the help of O'Malley the alley cat, a couple of geese, and Scat Cat and his gang, must now find their way back home to their mistress.The song numbers are wonderfully catchy, and the characters are loveable. The film is presented in the aspect ratio of 1.33:1, which, contrary to other reviewers and according to www.ultimatedisney.com , ""is almost certainly the aspect ratio of the original animation, even if the case implies that a modification has occurred."" Overall a wonderful purchase for your children."
4,Disney!,"I am trying to get all the Disney classics and I don't remember watching this movie when I was a kid but it was available so I bought it...and it's okay but I can remember now that I have it, why I didn't really watch it when I was a kid. It's kind of boring."
4,Aristocats Still Fresh After All These Years,"My 6-year old grandson and his friends enjoyed watching this, although I think it is more suitable for pre-school children."
5,"Wonderful movie, Wonderful cats!","I loved this movie ever since I saw it on VHS last year, so I had to get the DVD edition. A wonderful, clear video transfer shows that Disney's animation work in the 1970's was not as bad as some people think! And for those complaining about the movie being in a 1.33:1 aspect ratio... This is how it was produced! Most Disney films from this era were in 1.33:1."
4,"Good movie, NOT Disney's best-ONLY FAIR package","Not the best film Disney made. After Walt's passing this was the next release after 1967's great ""The Jungle Book"".More music work from The Sherman Brothers.This was I say is more designed for kids only. No outstanding characters. The Marie character for girls. The return of the late Phil Harris as O'Malley does not have the appeal of Baloo.There are quite a few extras on both discs, nothing outstanding. No Making of but you would not need one really for this film since not the top of Disney films.Now, Disney is now going cheap on blu ray packages. For the last few years they have been bending over backwards to promote blu rays, but here as they did with the Pocahontas package & Rescuers packages we get plain jane discs with no artwork on them.So, it is a good Disney movie certainly not the best. Only fair package as Disney goes cheap again."
2,decent just decent,I saw this movie the first time and i thought it would be really neat. i was so psyched because it took place in paris and i had seen a lot of advertising for it. but this is like a 101 dalmatians wanna-be failure! it is loaded with annoying songs that you wonder when they'll be done and get back to the dialogue. also there are plenty of bizarre details such as why does everyone speak with a quasi-English accent when they supposedly are from paris? why does the mouse hang out with cats? why are there 3 colors of cats from a white cat who never mentions any father figure who helped to produce them? why do the white cats have similar personalities and the brown cats as well? i think this movie is just lacking too much and there's really nothing to save it. it was okay. just okay.
5,EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE A CAT!!!!!1,"I LIKED THIS MOVIE. I ENJOY JUST ABOUT EVERY DISNEY CARTOON CLASSIC THERE IS. SO, THEREFORE IF YOU LIKE WALT DISNEY ANIMATION OR IF YOU LIKE CATS THEN I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU TO BUY THIS VIDEO. I AM NOT VERY FOND OF CATS BUT I LIKE THESE CATS AND THEY ARE SWINGING CATS."
3,"No Aging, cute cats","How is it that Disney movies don't seem to age? Even Snow White seems pretty normal nowadays. The Aristocats is not the best, prettiest or funniest Disney movie ever made but people who like sweet cats will enjoy the drawing of the cute little cats in this movie.The drawing of the people is very realistic and the animals all have their own personality, the jazzy alley-cats are my favorites. It's about 80 minutes long so perfect for young children."
3,Wonderful family friendly entertainment,"We rank this movie 25th out of the 41 Disney animated movies that we own. It is an average 3 star entertaining movie. The children have not asked to see this one for years. When they were younger it got watched occasionally.We had a lot of fun by gathering the family together to rank the 41 Disney movies we have that include some cartoon work. All the kids, ages 6 to 27, participated along with mother and dad. Lion King was selected number 1 of the 41 as the family favorite, but narrowly. Peter Pan was 2. Pete's Dragon 3, Beauty & the beast 4, Sleeping Beauty 5, Snow White 6, Robin Hood 7, 101 Dalmatians 8, Fox and the hound 9, Cinderella is 10th, Rescuers 11, Hunchback of ND 12, Aladdin 13, Aladdin King of Thieves 14, Jungle Book 15, Little Mermaid 16, Hercules 17, Winnie the Pooh 18, Rescuers Down Under 19, Sword in the Stone 20, Pinocchio 21, Mulan 22, Mary Poppins 23 and Lady and the Tramp 24."
4,Still Jazzy After All These Years!,"Adult humor and great vocals make Aristocats one of my favorite Disney movies. The characters are timeless and the setting is Paris. I personally don't think this is a video for young children because it will not hold their attention. For older children and adults who love Paris and cats, this is a winner!"
5,BEST IMAGE SHORT OF TRUE HI-DEF!,"Nostalgic artists' views of pre-WWI Paris and the French countryside are the backdrop for this sweet Disney classic. The colors and crispness of image on this DVD are truly amazing. I would love to see this movie on Blu-Ray. It is hard to imagine this film looked much better in the theater. The story is the tried and true Disney formula of separation and struggle to be reunited. Innocent enough for the youngest kids, this movie has plenty to offer their parents. It is a shame there aren't six stars for a film like this. The DVD also lets you isolate the songs and skip everything else. It's like buying a separate soundtrack disc but with full animation. I'd like to see this feature on ALL musical movie DVD's."
5,How could you not love this movie!,I purchased this movie for my 15 YEAR OLD. She remembered this movie and it was one of her favorites when she was much younger. It is such a cute movie. As a matter of fact our next cats are going to be named O'Malley and Duchess. No one can go wrong with the Aristocats - young or old!
1,video from amazon,"Couldn't play it, but was charged anyway!! I would believe that when ording a video online from a company such as Amazon.com one would be warned about difficulty playing such videos on certain computers. I never expected a problem, yet, the video would not play at all."
1,terrible quality!,"This video actually looks like someone went into a theater and taped it as it was playing on the screen! I have never see a ""real"" movie play like this...the sound is distorted, the playback is scratchy, and even the whole screen doesn't show up, it has a black line across the top portion of the screen during playback. I just assumed that the video was used was the reason it was so cheap...I didn't realize it was a rip off! Not even going to try and send it back, it only cost $3, just makes me mad that my son now doesn't have his video!"
3,Movie freezes and skips,The movie freezes up and skips about 10 to 15 seconds of the movie. Its not a huge deal so we didnt sentd it back. But very upsetting!
4,Anthropomorphised Cats as Musicians,"This cartoon shows cats in human forms, performing music. They are travelers. The cartoon Paris, the cats' destination, includes the Eiffel Tower. As the cats travel, one of them falls in the water, and is in danger of drowning. Two geese rescue the cat in the water, and get to join the entourage. This cartoon does not have much of a plot, but does include many hilarious scenes of cats singing and performing."
4,LOVE IT,My son loves the movie this is entertaining and fun great for the family its a great purchase we love it
5,Cute,"We loved this movie, in spite of its dated feeling with traditional gender roles and stereotyping characatures. animation is lovely."
4,A Classic!,Great Movie! It's the age-old story of the damsel in distress and the reluctant hero who rescues her! One of Disney's best! Everyone should own this one! I
4,classic,"We rented and were able to come back and finish the movie on the second night. 48 hour rental. A Classic, Kids loved it even without the fancy animation of today."
5,"Perfect! A non-violent, charming movie for little ones","With all of the violent cartoons out today, we looked long and hard for something like Aristocats to share with our daughter. She is sensitive to angry voices and loud noises so it was difficult to find a movie or cartoon that she could enjoy without having to skip the violent or noisy scenes.Aristocats is such a perfect little show for her to watch over and over, she now knows all of the songs, imitates the kittens and runs through the house calling ""Duchess, kittens, where are you??""If you want your child to enjoy Disney classics without the witches and mean-spirited people, or worse, the later movies with violence and loud, angry voices throughout, this is the best chance you have to show your child the lighter, gentler side of Disney."
3,Two purrs and a hiss,"The cat movie to 101 Dalmatian's dog story, The Aristocats is a fun and cute movie about a family of lost cats finding their way home. They encounter lots of eccentric animals along the way, from fellow cats to a pair of English geese on holiday.Unfortunately the cats did not get the Platinum Edition treatment all the more popular classics have been getting. The picture is grainy and sometimes oddly sketchy. There's no second disk of delicious extras to pour through either, just the bear minimum."
5,my daughter is a fan,"Great for cat lovers!It's a great family movie, focusing on love, loyalty, friendship and strength.Has a very good jazz soundtrack!Two thumbs up."
2,"Recycled, formulaic Disney","Take Phil Harris as Baloo the Bear, make him a cat, and have him rescue beloved pets from a criminal who intends to do them harm. Replace Louis Prima with Scatman Crothers to provide a jumping musical interlude in the middle of the film. If you can stand watching a mediocre hybrid of 101 DALMATIANS and JUNGLE BOOK, you might consider buying this movie. Your viewing time (and your kids' time, too) would be better spent with other films."
2,ick,"I tottally hate this movie. There were these singing cats that sang :""Everybody! Everybody! Everybody wants to be a cat! Everybody! everybody! Everybody wants to be a cat!"" Its about cats and pleased me when i was 5."
1,Boring....,"I liked this movie when I was little, now I'm 13, and when I recently watched ""The Aristocats"" I relized how bad and weak it is. The kittens are cute. But the story is, in my opinion, a rip-off of ""Lady and the Tramp"" and ""101 Dalmations"". The songs are really weak too, and the animation isn't all that great. If you wanna see a great, cute movie about animals, I recommend: ""The Lion King"", ""Bambi"", and ""Lady and the Tramp"". Don't waste your money on this. Sorry Disney."
1,"Boring, lackluster film by lazy animators...","At the point this film was made (early '70's) the animation staff had become so enamoured by the sterling quality of their own drawings that they forgot that maybe they should tell a story. This film has a lot of plot, but not a lot of story--and while the voices add a certain amount of bounce to the proceedings, they aren't given a whole lot to do other than mug to the mike. As Disney goes, it's right down there in the bottom of the barrel with Black Cauldron and Pocahontas."
2,Glad we only rented this,"I relied on my own fond childhood memories of this film when we decided to rent it for our son. The characters are still cute and compelling, and the music is ok. We were all having a lovely time until the racist stereotype of the Asian cat said something about a fortune cookie. My four-year-old didn't seem to notice, but my wife and I instantly swapped uncomfortable glances. It was a disappointing reminder of how stereotypes are learned from an early age, often through seemingly innocuous vehicles like cartoon movies."
3,"Not the best Disney film, but a nice release","The late 1960s and all of the 1970s were not a great time for Walt Disney Pictures. This film was made after Walt's death and it shows. Without his direction, the studio produced some real flops, and this film is one of them.The Aristocats suffers from the same ailments a lot of Disney films of this era suffered--a painfully slow pace and an aimless, meandering story. The Jungle Book and Robin Hood both had these issues to varying degrees. Like both of those films, this one does have some charm and a nice musical soundtrack. It is also very, very dated. That might make it a fun nostalgia trip for adults but expect this movie to be sort of boring for children.If you know that you or your children do like this film, this release is a nice one. Get it. If you just want to get a movie for your kids that will be tolerable for you to watch, know that this is not your best choice (try Bambi, Lady and the Tramp or Dumbo instead)."
4,funny touching and full of memories,"This is the first movie I remember seeing in the theater as a little girl so it'll always have a very special place in my heart.She didn't leave nothing to Edger after all she provided him a very comfortable living on the proviso he takes care of her cats. At the end of their life span he would've gotten everything left and that sounded like a good deal of real estate and $.I loved Thomas Omalley the geese and rouqfort. Especially a very funny momment where this tiny mouse is gathering the ally cats to help. you see about 6-8 ally cats running terrified through the streets of paris trying to get there in time to save the day with a tiny mouse waving his arms chasing them shouting wait you don't know the way."" A parisian man seeing this looks at his bottle of wine and poars it out. Maybe not one of disneys best but one of my all time favorites."
5,Aristocats,"It's a wondeful movie my son love's it alot of action and adventure and he love's the music , the singing , because he just loves music ..I would recomend this movie to anyone .."
4,Great for kids,"One of the funniest Disney cartoons ever! Great fun for the family. Artwork looks a little dated at times, however."
4,Tame Cats.,"Until recently I had never seen THE ARISTOCATS. Even though the movie is a good movie for families, I have to admit that I wasn't really missing much. The movie is a classical Walt Disney (the man) film. The animation isn't much to look at nowadays, but when the film came out it was top notch. The story is rather simple and the film really doesn't have that memorable music. If you're a cat lover, you will probably love the movie. However, I'm a dog person and was really hoping Edgar would get away with his crime. I mean if I spent my entire life working as a Butler for a rich old lady and was promised to inherit some of her wealth only to find that I wouldn't get anything until the cats were dead, I would be pretty upset, too. A fun, but tame, film."
5,Willie and Ruben are the best!!!,"God bless the old salsa and the ambassadors that make them in this case Willie from Puerto Rico and Ruben from Panama.I am from Puerto Rico and the Puertorican salsa are the best like Tito Puente,Willie Colon,Hector ''El cantantes de los cantantes'' Lavoe and Rey Barreto.!Long Live the Old Salsa!"
5,Devoured this page-turner,"I completely devoured this book. This is a classic ""page turner,"" but I also found myself really moved -- by the wife, mostly, and the mother. Of course, you compare this to the news, but somehow it's more. This is really something different."
3,Not as thrilling as I thought it would be,"I saw this book while browsing in a bookstore and decided it would be ""an edge of your seat"" thriller. The beginning of the book was really good and it was hard to put down. Somewhere in the middle, I just lost interest in the story and my mind wandered as I read the pages. I have mixed feelings about recommending this book. If you have others that you are anxiously waiting to read, my suggestion would be read those first. Then when you have nothing else to read, read this one. It's not a suspense, thrill-ride book.One thing I will give the author is her ability to write in four perspectives to tell the story. I thought she did a great job of tailoring her writing styles to fit each narrator. At the beginning of each chapter, the author will let the reader know which character is speaking. At times, I didn't have to read that; I was just able to tell through her writing techniques."
1,Relatively Boring & Badly Written,"This is my first book by this author. It will also be my last. Usually, when I dislike a book, I give the author (and myself) another chance. But this book was so badly written that I really am not interested in a potential repeat. I will not re-tell the story, as other reviewers have done this and the summary from Amazon is pretty extensive. The story line (young woman disappears - who did it?) could have been interesting, albeit it has been done before (what hasn't?), but it just wasn't. I simply could not feel with or for any of the characters. To me, they all seem superficial, not fleshed out, and I could not have cared less what they thought or felt. In addition, the book is written very choppily and in a non-gripping, non-suspenseful style. Bottom line: forget about this book. It is not even worth getting from the library."
3,Ripped From The Headlines?,"An intern to a California State senator goes missing. It turns out the senator was having an affair with her. Sound familiar? This story seems to be loosely based on the Gary Condit and Chandra Levy story. The narration jumps around from one character to another, but once I got used to this style of writing, the story was easier to follow. I'm not normally a big fan of political thrillers, but Hill made this one interesting. The characters are complex and the dialog is especially well done. The story moves along at a good clip and there were frequent hooks to past secrets that kept me turning pages. There was a bit of graphic sex toward the end, which might not be for everyone. Even if the reader is not familiar with the Condit/Levy story, I think they will find this an interesting read."
5,Was murder is only way out?,"As a reader of many books, romance and thriller, i enjoyed this book. It will keep you on the edge of your seat for days to come, you won't want to put the book down.This book jumps from one character to another. Each character's point-of-view si given thought as to what had happened throughout the days of finding out the murderer of April Wayne.Action happens and fights occur. More murders possibly and even blackmail. People turn on those that they love and soon others hate those that they once loved.Secrets are revealed, lovers are lost.Read the book, it will keep you guessing as to what happened and who did what!"
1,Sad,"Got this it worked for a couple of months, just quit working. Very disappointed with this item. Would not buy it again"
2,Problems with the armband,"The armbands on these watches are not on hinged pins, but attached directly to the housing of the watch. That makes them prone to breakage, and when they break they are almost impossible to replace. I've found quite a few stores that sell Skagen watches but none that sell Skagen armbands. I've been told that I would have to send the watch in, which would take 4-6 weeks and cost more than half the original sale price of the watch. Great design, but I'm not going to buy another Skagen watch!"
5,i love this watch,I have small wrists and this watch fits great and looks great. the band is very comfortable. it does everything that you would ask of a watch. this won't be the last skagen watch i buy.
3,the straps break easily,"The kids really enjoy them, but the straps have already broken. You definately need the safety gear, but they're quite a hit"
4,"""Fun"" Zombie movie it is pretty good!","I like this movie, no it is not as good as lets say Shawn of the Dead, but it is a tidy little zombie / kung fu movie. I always like to watch the movie and read the subtitles so I did it that way first, then I listened to the dubbed version and let me tell you the people doing the dubbing on this one are REALLY good, they adlib a bit and actually make the movie more funny!It is on IFC every now and then, if not get it here.Jimn"
1,Funny if you really ARE a zombie?,"Don't let the bald-head-wig fool you! This is not a funny movie. The biggest joke will be that you wasted time or money on it. Certainly, I imagine that this flick could appeal to certain types. However, if you have taste and discretion, don't purchase this dvd!! Rent only, and if you can't do that, fu-geddaboudit!"
4,Yes!,This was a fun movie...basically it's a totally whacked out zombie movie that's unlike any other zombie movie you've seen; absolutely jam packed with crazy Japanese humor. It was quite interesting and fun to watch a zombie movie with that zany and off beat style that only Japanese films can do. Add to it the always great Tadanobu Asano; and you've got a movie primed to pique the interest of any true movie geek.If you're one of the few people that either likes the zombie genre or off beat Asian films... you gotta check this out; if you like both genres like me... it's a pretty safe bet you'll have a blast with this. Doesn't take itself seriously at all... just pure fun. 4/5 stars.
5,Good Product,My memory has worked exceedingly well. My computer can now function much faster and I can have more windows opened without slowing it down.
1,Mistaken identity?,"I ordered this memory chip from among several listed as being for NOTEBOOK PC's(My PC being a Compaq Presario notebook). Upon reception, it was obviously for a desktop PC. I called the toll-free number for TigerDirect and it was confirmed that it WAS for a desktop, and was given a ""Return Authorization"" code number for a refund. I was also told, with regrets, that they had no chips for my notebook in stock.I received notification of my refund and a credit to my credit card fairly promptly. However, I still have no chip and am ""out"" my time and money spent for ""Shipping and Handling"" and postage to return the item.I'm not angry as I know these things happen in the best of worlds, but I probably wil try to get the chip at Best Buy or similar source."
2,"better at the time,still has some moments",when N.W.A first came out there was nothing like them.they truly brought the pain.this Ep has some decent Grooves to go along with there takes on different matters.but then as especially now you truly miss Ice Cube's Pressence because things get thin after a while.but there are still some cool moments here.
4,100 MILES AND NOT STOPPIN',TO ME THIS WAS JUST A PREQUAL TO WHAT WAS YET TO COME...SOMETHIN' TO HOLD YOU OVER 'TIL THE NIGGA4LIFE ALBUM...IT DEFINATELY TEASED THE AVERAGE N.W.A. FANS...IT MADE YOU EITHER GIVE UP ON THEM OR DROOL FOR WHATS NEXT.I LIKED IT !!!IF I HAD TO DESCRIBE THIS EP IN ONE WORD IT THE WORD WOULD BEF O R E P L A Y OR F O U R P L A YDUE TO HOW THEY PLAYED WITH THE FANS DURING 4 TRACKS.
5,YES!,This album still kicks booty! This is the one that got me into the style - the production is right on.
1,Angel Wars: The Messenger,"I bought this DVD for my grandsons for Christmas. When they opened it to play it there was no DVD in it. It was sealed and never been opened so we couldn't figure out what had happened. Sorry it has taken me so long, they are in Colorado and we just remembered that I needed to writ to this seller."
5,Great But....,"the dvd is very good but the only thing i didn't like is that i wish it was a movie becuz it is so good.it is a bunch of episodes put into one dvd.but i HIGHLY recommend it becuz its funny,fun,etc.BUY IT cuz its great for kids and adults"
1,All fluff no substance,"This is not an instructional book. It pretty much just showcases the artist's work. If you want to buy useful reference books on watercolor, get books by Joseph Zbukvic and/or Robert Wade. They are exceptional painters and teachers. Their books are filled with gorgeous artwork and useful information for artists of all levels."
2,One dimensional and incomplete,"I ordered this book because I have a ranch in Central Texas where I raise pastured beef and market it direct. I am also setting up potager gardens to offer fresh vegetables and herbs, in addition to unusual plants well suited for Texas' hot summers, be they native or not (native is relative, in my mind, but that's a whole other topic). Since my ultimate goal is to move the ranch in the direction of permaculture, I thought this book might be useful on how to incorporate some plants into that and the Potager garden design. I was somewhat disappointed. There isn't much at all about shrubs, whether or not one is interested in standard urban landscaping or something more biodynamic.Also many plants, including shrubs and trees, are edible which the author really didn't delve into either.Never the less, as I research what types of plants fit certain niches in what I am trying to do, I am sure I will refer to this book from time to time."
4,Another great Howard Garrett book,"I have checked out many Howard Garrett books from the library and had to buy several for myself and for gifts. The photos are beautiful, and he tells you what he thinks of the different species. Howard Garrett writes great books for people wanting to establish beautiful landscapes and gardens. He explains why healthy, organic soil with native plants and bugs works really well if it is done right.My only complaint with most of his books is that he lists the specimens in alphabetical order. That is what indexes are for. If he would group them with similar specimens, then between the photos and his descriptions, the books would be great for identifying species I find on my property. As it is, I have to get a separate field guide to tell me the names to look up in his books; but, I am willing to do that.In Plants for Texas, I especially appreciate the lists of Texas' Bests and Worsts, and of course all the close-up photos."
3,Good for the price,"I have had some bags lose their vacumn. I have only used about 30 so far, and I am satified for the cost. I hope that the failure rate is not too high, but it is still a little early to be sure. I figure that I will just keep an eye on them and use the ones that lose their vacumn first.At less than 20 cents a bag I will buy again."
4,very good value,had a few bags not seal but still feel it was a good deal compared to what's out there. I like being able to buy a large quantity.
4,Donato & Estefano,This CD is very inspirering for the young mind. Even though I can't understand Potugese. Some of these pieces have good music and beet rythem and all that other fancy stuff we talk about in music classes. Some other songs are a little bit scrathcy in whitch they are either slow or have no feeling in my case.
4,Fun Latin pop,"The title song is the best on this CD. Donato y Estefano have a very Ace of Base sort of sound, so if you like them, you'll like this group. Other good songs are Destino and Amoromania."
4,"Bite size tubes, great for little fixes but kinda small","These are great little packets of krazy glue. The tip is designed to break the seal as you screw it on and you don't have to worry about it crusting up after one use, 'cause that's all you're getting out of it. You can fix a coffee mug handle or a small piece of plastic, I'd say, but I tried using one of these for a slightly larger piece of metal and there just wasn't that much product inside. Good for small jobs."
5,So handy.,"I'm so glad they have this form of Krazy glue, which is more useful than the brush-on or any other form. Really, who ever needs more instant glue than you have in a small tube? And you are less likely to get the stuff on your hands. Only complaint, wish they made it in a package with more tubes."
5,These things are awesome,Even though these are single use tubes I have used them more then once on occasion. The plastic holder is nice too to keep the tubes organized and from leaking in your house. I've purchased this twice now and plan to keep getting it when I need crazy glue. I would not hesitate to purchase this.
5,Very Handy!,"I had never seen Crazy Glue offered like this before, and I was always waisting my tubes because once you opened them, if you weren;t very careful, they became usless because they would get hard, or the cap would stick shut, so then you would have to go get a new tube and throw away over half of the old one! These little tubes are perfect and make your purchase last a whole lot longer since you get a brand new tiny tube each time you need to use Crazy Glue! I find it much more ecinomical to purchase my glue in this form and would reccomend it whole heartily!"
5,sarah,Favorite pencils at our small office. Boss won't use anything else and this is the best price we've found. Will defiantly buy again
4,Very Classic looking,"The color is very beautiful. I like this a lot. It looks great and is very practical. The only drawback is that it is not as tall as I'd like it to be. That is my own fault. I should have ordered the large. But still this pitcher is beautiful, well made and very useful."
5,"""LA VOZ""","something is missing in the world of salsa,and it is the great hector lavoe. it is a shame that many artists of today if not all of them do not use the imagination and creativity that was used in the 60's and 70's and they prefer to be recognised by a market that does not deserve to be indulged with the salsa rithms. instead they seek personal fame and fortune and atract the population that have never apreciated the jungle rithms, and forget those who have been there since the beginning. even my grandmother says the salsa is fading away and the true rumberos will never come back...like Hector!"
3,"""The voice, that was LAVOE""","""... I will be with my people, until they take me against my will, until they take me to my tomb"" these words came true on June 29, 1993.A proud Jibarito (Puerto Rican, native) he always kept his latin roots alive through his music, lyrics and they will stay alive for as long as we remember -"
4,Great book,"It is a very good book. Although I disagree with some of the practices. I talked to quite few experts on preserving the sexual energy(if you're a man) and I was told that if I do it I run extremely high risk of getting prostate problems in the future. If you look at lots of the tantric masters of the past most of them died very young and I bet it was because of prostate issues. I say if you feel like your body is overloaded with sexual energy, shoot it out and you'll feel very balanced and good afterwards."
3,Toltec Expansion/Companion Texts,"Tunneshende is a name I'm not familiar with but I've studied Toltec Sorcery for some time. This book is a valid study of the sexual energies and how the relate to perception, however, I believe this woman to be making up her affiliation with don Genaro and don Juan. Writters expanding on the works of toltec energetics often have some useful and insightful information but it is hard to take them seriously when they're making stories up about nagual guides. A decent book on this yet to be covered topic - the stories are even good (even if she did make them up). The book is a little more ""New-Agey"" than Castaneda's work."
3,Portable But Thoroughly Flawed!,"This book's commentary is severely flawed with different views of what the KJV Bible portrays. For instance, the word ""virtue"" doesn't mean ""power"" as one of the commentary notes suggests. So if you want to witness to someone, the false notes would not help strengthening your faith nor help convert a NIV user to KJV.Also, in two instances (Hebrews 4:8; Acts 7:45) ""Jesus"" is actually changed to ""Joshua"" in the Bible itself which is straight from the perverted Bible versions. Yet, if you download Bible programs the KJV Bible doesn't change Jesus at all to Joshua! This is a major flaw that needs to be addressed.The only good thing about this so-called Bible is that it is portable for what it has."
5,A delight for all who are young at heart,"Mozz has written and illustrated with amazing creativity. How many authors can do both?! The best part is that his ideas stir the imagination and encourage conversation - can definitely be used to initiate children's writing and drawing. Poems such as ""The Big Abominable Wordeater and ""Let the Hat Stand Sit"" are absolute word feasts. I also enjoyed the creative transformations of ideas in such poems as ""T-shirt Tattoo"" and ""Lucky Escape."" This writing is right up there with Shel Silverstein. A fresh and welcome addition to my book shelf."
4,Marvelous Mozz and His Pearls,"Mozz is amazing! I love his creative way of looking at things! Common everyday objects become something I would have never dreamed up. Galatic fried eggs, suitcases with wings (what a great idea!), and exceedingly long arrows that guarantee a bullseye every time, live among other novel thoughts in this entertaining and funny book. I love surprises and Mozz weaves them into every electric light verse and shocking scribble. The whimsical and marvelous illustrations put Mozz at the top of my list for how to increase the imagination of just about any child or adult. What a great gift for any kid of any age."
1,beware,"Manufacturer has apparently changed ingredients. I had used it in the past without a problem...this year it has made me break out as I never have before. I stopped it, tried again after three months just to be sure it was the product..and indeed: another break out!In the trash it goes....and off to search for a better sunscreen!"
5,Less IS more...,"I purchased this watch about a year ago and paid full price in a department store. Even at list price, I think that it's a great value. Skagen watches epitomize the art cliche, ""less is more."" Since nothing else looks like a Skagen, even with its minimalist, ultra thin design, it stands out. They keep great time, they are never heavy or distracting, the titanium is feather light, and they look dressy or sporty, whatever you are wearing. Jewelry store quality, can't understand how they can be so inexpensive! Lifetime guarantee!"
4,A Good Looking Watch.,"Simple response, This is a nice looking, comfortable and stylish watch. It works in a casual and professional setting. I made a great coice in its purchase."
4,looks great,"This is a very neat dress watch. I recommend it, despite the comments below. It is a bit smaller than I expected, but was very good value. I may look for something a bit chunkier for sporty outings. The hands and date are easy to read despite the plain dial. The quartering on the dial looks good. I managed to adjust the timne and date without reading the instructionsDifficulties? I struggled to adjust the strap - you need a screwdriver and a good grasp of engineering and the manual is not much use. I initially got the clasp on backwards and also had a lot of difficulty closing the clips. Then when I had the strap the right length I found it quite hard to do the bracelet up. If you buy this (and I hope you will) do practice over a table and do not have the strap very tight - it won't do up like that."
2,Nice watch!!! but I have a better one,"Overall, this is a nice Skagen, but unfortunatly it wasn't as thin as I wanted it to be. I have a different skagen that is way thinner than this one. If you are a starter, by all means get this watch. but if you like Really thin, don't go for this watch"
2,Paint Comes Off,"Within 2 days of receiving this nice-looking watch, the paint on the clasp andsome on the mesh band flaked off, leaving strips of dull gray next to the nice black color on the band. This totally ruins the look of the watch. Any ideas on what kinds of paint I could use to replace the paint that flaked off?"
1,Not funny and not worth the money.,"We rented this hoping for some light entertainment, and because we had heard one of the comics on XM and wanted to hear more. At the end of the show, my husband and I both said, ""What a waste of time and money!"" The funniest comics barely were on and off the stage, while the one that was on the longest wasn't really funny at all. Even the better ones weren't that interesting. My advice: Don't waste your money!"
4,Another book in a good series,"Having just finished the book The Holy Road which is the sequel to Dances with Wolves, it was interesting how well Tracie Peterson in The Coming Storm gives a different perspective about the same time period. I like historical novels that are so true to the time they are written about. I also liked how various family members were again included in the story such as re-introducing Trenton Chadwick in a greater role. Diane is truly a woman of faith and courage as she continues to face life on the frontier. This is not a 'happily ever after' kind of series so it's refreshing and encouraging to read how one woman faces all of these adversities in her life. Looking forward to reading the third book."
2,too much grief for enjoyment,I usually love Christian fiction - but this one just overflowed with misery. I couldn't stand it.
4,The Coming Storm,The book was in great condition. It arrived in less than a week. I was pleased with the purchase.
3,Dolby It's Not,"The 60's sound and video was marginal. The 70's era sound was a little better especially '79, the ""My Wife"" number had a good video and audio quality especially Pete's sound. The 80's sound especially the guitar was lost in the production."
3,Too much to take in,"Good effort but too much filler and weak songs. For diehards only. Better to get your favorite albums and remember how you felt when you first heard them, reading lyrics and studying the album covers."
2,"DVD Fun, Box Mislabled","Liked the DVD, the concert footage was fun, but the ""8 page booklet"" and liner notes are no where to be found, too bad."
5,a must see for every music-documnted lover,"I am a fan of The Who and I'd like to recommend it not only to Who fans but to everyone WHO cares about the roots of music back in the 60's. My favorite moment is when Keith collapses on stage, and Pete manages to find someone WHO can play the drums, not as good as, but still... I wish rock and roll will have more classics such as this one - a must see for anyone WHO bothered to check this review!"
4,Good phone for students,"This phone is a tank. Since it has no antenna, it's pretty smooth and easy to drop (for me at least). I must have dropped it two or three times a week for the last four months and it hasn't suffered any ill-side effects.It is also a very customizable phone. Each of the direction on the inside pad can be set to open up your voice messages, IM, calendar, ring tone menu, todo list, sound settings, phone book, messages, missed called, incoming calls, etc. You're even given the option to have the service LCD flash red, orange, or green.On the down side, the microphone seems to be dying. It could possibly be a sideeffect to all the dropping, but it's mostly just annoying. My friends say it sounds like a robot is mumbling to them over the phone.A good phone over all, with few down sides."
4,"Tough, Reliable Phone","I have been using this phone for 3 months now. I have to mention that this phone survived a dip in hot tea. Accidentally, the phone slipped into a cup of hot tea and literally drowned in it for a good 30 seconds or so. I opened the phone, took the Sim card out and let it dry. I was not sure it would function, but lo and behold, I let it dry for a week and the phone is back to normal. The reception is good. The only complaint I have about this phone is the battery life. Overall, a tough and reliable phone."
4,somsung x475,"I have had my phone for about 6 months now and have had absolutly no problems with it. It gets good service, even in little towns in Iowa. I rarely get disconnected and if i ever do its the other persons fault. For it being a free phone I would rank it above some that have camera capabilities. Durable and slick!"
2,Poor Sound Quality,"Pros: small and compact, color display, download ringtones.Cons: poor sound quality. The sound is slightly muffled and it sounds like callers are not enunciating clearly. Callers say I sound the same way on the phone, and they have to say ""what"" a lot. Increasing the volume doesn't help. Every voicemail message I try to listen to on this phone has had at least a couple words I can't understand at all. I've tolerated this phone for a full year. I am getting a new phone specifically because of the poor sound. I use it for work and can't afford the lack of sound clarity. Also, I found the menus a little cumbersome. Checking voicemail, looking up a number in the phone book, and changing the ringer to vibrate all take several steps."
3,This phone is very small,"If you don't do a lot of talking this is a good phone, because its very comfortable in your pocket because its the smallest flip phone out there. The voice-quality is too poor for someone who talks more than a few minutes a day.Cons:1) Voice quality is terrible, the worst I have ever heard2) Vibrate is too weak, sometimes I miss calls3) phone is tedious to navigate and software is buggy4) Everyone refuses to talk to me on the hands-free because the voice quality is even worsePros:1) Smallest flip phone2) Long battery life - I get 4 hours of talk time.3) You can assign 3 numbers to one nameNeutral:reception seems to be the same as every other phone. I have never been someplace with a t-mobile customer and had reception when they did not."
2,"I second the ""poor sound quality"" review","I have had this problem as well...the sound is very muffled. I have to turn the volume way up, which is annoying, and I still have trouble understanding people. I am looking for another cell now."
2,OK Phone,"The samsung x475 flip phone is ok. However, it does have quite a few drawbacks. The battery life is short, the reception isn't the best, and the phone is too smaill and hard to open. This was my first phone with T-Mobile and since then I have bought a new Motorola V330 which is much better. Plus-I don't recomend that you buy any Samsung phone from T-Mobile because all they do if you have problems with the phone is the ship you a refurbished phone-not a new one. T-Mobile on top of that has the worst costumer service. I either recomend Verizon or Cingular!!"
1,Dont fall under Amazon false Promises,"I purchased two cell phones samsung e315 and samsung x475 and chose 2 day shipping.guess what!! I received only one phone ,and the worst part is they even dont know where the other cell phone is..bcz UPS tracking doesnt show anything(wierd).They activated both the phones and I am being charged from the first day I purchased for not even seeing my cell phone.!!AMAZON EVOLVE!!!"
3,samsung x475 phone,"i think the phone lookes great but know and a days kids are looking for phones with cool technology i mean kids buy more phones than audults right. if you make a new invention think about putting in a mp3 player and a camara phone i mean kides will tell there parents to buy them, i know i will. next time you think of a new invention think about that!P.S I REALLY LIKE THE COLOR BUT WHEN YOU MAKE A NEW INVENTION DONT FORGET TO MAKE SOME PINK OR BLUE OR BABY PURPLE TRY IT I WOULD KNOW IM A KID (MABY) ANYWAY YOUR DOING A GOOD JOB KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK"
1,A disappointment,"This book was a huge disappointment. It was very basic and very vague. For example, it would tell you to shape the brow to make their face look longer or shorter, but it wouldn't tell you how to shape the brow in order to do that. All the pictures were small, in black and white, and it was hard to see any detail. I kept on reading on, hoping that I was going to get to the good stuff, but the good stuff never came. I truly felt like I learned nothing and it was supposed to be an instructional book. A waste of money. I was debating returning it, but it doesn't seem worth it to go to the post office and have to pay for shipping it back."
2,disappointed with this price,"Is it a textbook for students? I think it is. Is it a good textbook? I don't think it is. When I carefully read the whole book, close it and ask myself what I got from this book. One thing. It is not easy to design a perfect eyebrow. If someone asks if I can design for her face now, I have to say sorry and I must read the book once again or more."
3,"Good for kids with strong language skills, frustrating for other kids.","If your kids are naturally strong in language skills, this is probably a great review for them. My kids are not. They love math and science, but language... no. I started them out with these Daily Language Review books, and that was a mistake. These books don't actually teach any one skill. Each day has a few different activities: spelling, punctuation, grammar, whatever, with just a few questions of each. So for a kid who has strong language skills, this would be great, not too much boring repetition. My kids, however, need each skill thoroughly outlined and instructed and practiced. This book was frustrating and mind-boggling to them."
2,There are better workbooks...,"This workbook alternates from being overly repetitive to suddenly introducing new and advanced language concepts without using a gradual introduction. I took the time to fill in where the book was lacking, but my child and I found the inconsistency wearing. In addition, considering that I paid more for this workbook than any of the others I ordered, I do not recommend it."
5,love it,As an elementary school teacher I am always on the look out for things that are going to supplement my teaching. This is one of those things.Great for homework and getting parents involved int heir child's education.
5,Winter in Eden,"While I'm not a hardcore sci-fi fan,I was totally blown away by the concept of the ""West of Eden"" series. I especially liked book II...""Winter in Eden"". This story really became a character study for heros. While there is one main character throughout the series, in book II the focus quickly gets shifted to a female,(our main character's mate) and forget everything you ever knew about heros!This woman is devoted to her mate, and will do anything to maintain their family's well being. Some of the situations faced by these characters is a true testament to human endurance. The very idea that nomadic tribes could exist under some of the conditions described with-in the pages of this gripping story still give me shivers, and I fully intend to read this wonderful series again. Mr. Harrison is truly one of my favorite Authors."
3,Slow-going story after incredible West Of Eden,"If West Of Eden was a rich story full of events, this one was quite ""static"" and almost boring. It seems that author did not know really where to go. After 260 pages, it looks like that nothing has yet happen. As another reader said, the Vainte/Kerrick confrontation was absent."
3,"Good, but unsatisfying","As one would expect from Harrison, Winter in Eden is well-written, and attention-riveting. Its biggest failing is that it follows West of Eden - an incredible novel in all respects. Winter in Eden, while worth reading, seems undeveloped, less focused. Perhaps it is the absence of the Vainte/Kerrick dynamic. Perhaps it is that the Yilane are now familiar and no longer wonderous strange. Or perhaps it is simply that perfection is seldom captured twice."
1,Dumb and insulting,"Lets see, the Atom bomb doesn't work unless it is sitting still? How then would you explain Hiroshima and Nagasaki? Well if your the author of this book, You can belive that a US army weather plane just happens to be flying over Hiroshima when a Major earthquake strikes the city (One of only about 5 major Jappenese cities that had not already been bombed to oblivion). So the Army Burns, and spreads radation over the City and then sets off a huge flash bulb to convince the people of Japan the bomb works. (Hollywood does the rest) Then thee days later another earthquake Just happens to hit one of the few Japanese cities, Nagasaki, not yet destoyed, and we do the same thing all over again convincing the Japanese to surrender. Now I enjoy a good conspiracy theory as much or more than most, however, this book would be laughable if it were not such an insult to those who were in the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki when they were bombed."
3,Well written book for absolut beginners,"A very easy book, but a nice way to learn about all the fundamentals in web-audio. I miss some futher steps in handling the audio-files, like how to make web pages more interactive with sound. Putting a sound on a web-page simply is not interesting enough. I recommend this bokk to those of my friends that have never worked with web-audio before. And a bonus, it's quikly read."
5,excellent book,This book is very well-written and is especially good for people who are not technical experts.
3,Pipe Stress Handbook,"I want to review, this handbook because is very important for consulting in my job."
2,Fair to Middling,"Certainly better than the rubbish Gris Grimly scribbles (he really should stick to his illustrations, which are magnificent), but this collection rhyming poetry simply doesn't hold a candle toAlice in Verse: The Lost Rhymes of Wonderland-- rhyming poetry at its very best."
3,Nice coffee table book to skim through,"Although this book was interesting, I had hoped for a little more readable vintage material. The handwriting that was used to describe the page theme was difficult and tiring to read. I would have been happier if it was a lower price as there are not many pages to the book."
4,Good Album for those who know who the Mills Bros are,I grew up listening to the Mills Brothers on 8 track as my grandparents would drive my siblings and I in their 76? Delta 88 with velvet interior and power windows (remember when power windows were a luxury?). As a result I've always had a fondness for the Mills Brothers and this album allows me to remember those days with nostalgia.
5,Master of Verse Craft,"Lucid, witty, charming and honest to the degree of a confession. This Craft of Verse is a testimony to Borges' lifelong love of literature and a masterful commentary on the art of reading and the craft of writing. Each chapter showcases Borges' poetic sensibility to transfix the mundane into the magical. The reader gains privileged access into the mind's eye of the Borgesian dreamscape, that rarefied vista of the sublime replete with uncanny insights, twists of perception and mnemonic powers worthy of Homer. A highly recommended work of refined taste and culture."
5,"If you love poetry, you'll love this book","Borges offers here his highly idiosyncratic views and thoughts about that mysterious thing called poetry.What, after all, really distinguishes poetry from verse? It's like ""time"" --- everybody understands ""time"" unless they are asked to define it exactly. In the same way, anyone who loves poetry can recognize it, as they can recognize Very High Verse (""Why break a butterfly upon the wheel?"")This book is particularly enjoyable because one suspects, while reading it, that this ""amateur"" account of poetry is spot-on, leaving many dusty academics far, far behind.""Dreaming, when dawn's left hand was in the sky..."" What IS IT about that word ""left,"" anyway?? Did you ever think of ""rosy-fingered dawn"" as having two hands? Would it work if you simply substituted ""right hand"" for ""left hand?""Think about that for a while. The answer seems to be ""No."" But WHY?Welcome to the world of word-magic!One of the best books ever written on the subject."
4,Nice Chairs,"These are really nice chairs, very happy with them. Nice and sturdy and they come pre-assembled which is nice. The only downside is the cost of shipping which was quite high. We ordered 3 of the sets of 2 (so 6 chairs total) and I think shipping was $200. But we couldn't find anything we liked in the department stores so we were kind of stuck. Overall extremely happy with the chairs, upset with shipping costs."
3,A little cheesy..,"I was disappointed in this item. When it arrived it looked 'cheesy'. However the person whom I gave it to seemed to like it well enough. Wondered if he was just being polite. Also, the sticky 'tag' was across the pictures and it would not come off easily. A minor annoyance."
1,Amazon false advertising!!!,"Amazon says the strap I ordered is in stock, and after waiting over a week I contacted the company and they have none in stock and don't know when they might get some."
1,small portion of PV,This is not a map of PV as it proports to be but only a small section. To me this map is grossly misrepresented. Not worth it.
2,Disappointing,"This should be taken off your website. I also picked to get over the free shipping without reading reviews. It states in description June of 2004, but in fact it was January 02!"
3,Historical fiction mixed with reality...,"I really enjoy reading books where the author takes a real person, Mozart in this case, and explores what their life would have been like. However, this isn't just a story of a twenty something Mozart. It's also the story of the four Weber sisters- Josefa, Aloysia (any clue how to say that?), Constanze and Sophie, daughters of a music copyist. The sisters' lives intertwine with Mozart over the course of several years and cities- from Munich to Vienna. I found each of the Weber sisters to be very interesting to read about, they were all so different. The only thing that bothered me was towards the end of the book when the relationships between the sisters and their mother were focused upon a bit too much."
3,Interesting but loses speed,"I started this book about Mozart & his relationships with the four daughters of a poor musician with a lot of excitement. The first half of the book is interesting & well-written, the pace is fast enough to keep you interested & the story is intriguing. After the middle part of the book, though, it seemed to get bogged down in lots of boring conversations about different characters, the picture of the daughters starts to sour & make them more dreary & jaded. I just lost interest & finally I didn't care if he ever married one of the girls or got hit by a fast-moving carriage. I skimmed the last fourth of the book just to see who Mozart ended up hitched to & was glad to be done. If you're really into Mozart, you might be very attracted to this book, but if you're just looking for a good read I would recommend that you go elsewhere."
2,Not so good,"I gave this book two stars instead of one because I decided to finish it (otherwise I would have given this book 1 star). Generally, if I am not riveted by a book by the 50th page, I put it down. The author writes in a very simplistic style and her description of the characters is shallow. The plot meanders to its conclusion. The book left me without any sort of sense of satisfaction."
1,Strictly a Girl Book,"The novel reads like a Harelquin Romance. The author weaves an interesting story which gets drowned in modern impulses and language unsuited to the time. I stuck with the book for the love of Mozart. Contrast this pulp fiction with the wonderful ""Clara"" based on the life of Clara Schuman. No contest."
2,"A promising beginning, but ultimately a painful read","I'm frankly a little surprised to see so many positive reviews of this book. I was intrigued by the story at the beginning, but as it unfolded, the characters seemed more and more wooden and the dialogue became laughable. If I had to hear Mrs. Weber call her daughters ""my little fleas"" one more time, I vowed to stop reading. I finally ended up skimming the last 50 pages to end my misery, as I really didn't care what happened to the shallow characters. I think Stephanie Cowell has the potential to be a good descriptive writer, but somehow this story fell painfully flat. Kudos to her for the underlying idea, which was a creative approach to telling the tale of Mozart. I would not, however, recommend this book to those who desire a more lyrical--and believable--read."
4,A Fun Romp,"I read this book after The Passion of Artemisia by Susan Vreeland and found reading it fun and refreshing. Marrying Mozart is a fairly quick read but manages to have engaging characters, a fast-paced and slightly surprising plot, and is entertaining. If you want historical details, I'm not sure, haven't done the research. If you want some pleasure reading and to be immersed in another time and locale- this is your book. I often forgot that this book is considered fiction which basically is a sign of good writing. Not something I can say for the Susan Vreeland book."
4,Pleasant reading,"I am a huge fan of Mozart and knew that I had to read this book. I do have to agreee with another reviewer and feel that this book was mistitled. It is not so much about Mozart's marriage and his relationship with his wife as it is about his early years and the relationship he had with the Weber family (more specifically, the four Weber sisters). I, too would have liked to see it go on further and explore the marriage, itself.It did start out alittle slow, but after about 75 pages, or so, the pace quickened and the plot got more lively. It is a quick and enjoyable read and I do recommend it. Mozart fans will love it."
3,Wolfgang the Dilatory,"While it may follow historical fact, this book becomes tedious to read because the characters are so predictable and disengenious. Although it is up to the reader to imagine the ending, it cannot be but more of the same: Too many children too close together, more poverty, and less recognition for Mozart."
5,Between Earth and Sky; Firmly Grounded in Praise,"Between Earth and Sky is an adventure film with a touching human facet. A well developed story of adventurers achieving more then their intended goals even when they thought their objectives were unatainable. Rattlecan Films proves adventure films don't need to use the word ""dude"" in every other sentence to be hugely successful."
5,hurry up and get to sleep!!,"I didn't know what to expect when I first got the cd in the mail. I have a newborn that just will not go to sleep no matter what I try. I've looked around and spent hundreds of dollars on gadgets claiming to be sleeping aids for infants, and all I got in return was a huge visa bill at the end of the month. Then I stumbled upon Baby Sleep Sweet because a friend recommended it to me and what a pleasant surprise. The music is absolutely enchanting. There aren't that many cd's out there for babies, and when you find one, they tend to be a little too new age for my taste. Baby Sleep Sweet gets it right, and will also take you back in time to when we all use to be in our parent's loving arms! ahh the good old days!"
2,Somewhat Disappointed,The product was third party vs Cisco when I recieved it. The facet it was third party was not clearly depicted when I purchased it. I did not return it since it did work and was only for home use.
4,A little oversized,"This pants are bigger than the average size, buy at leat one size small. Other than that, very good product."
4,Pure enjoyment,"This work by Carolyn Carlson is very inovative in a good sense. Although I did not grasp the relation between the dances and their titles, I was enchanted by what was going on. This creation merits a good audio system as well as the best and largest screen to fully absorb it's impact."
5,French Ballet at its best,I bought this DVD for a friend but kept it myself as I loved it. I was going to watch just a couple of scenes but the choreography and scenery as well as the athleticism of the dancers kept me enthralled. Would definitely recommend.
4,GREAT grips,"They are a bit fatter than stock grips . They dampen the snap of a .40 on the wrist .""For me"" they are stickier than hard plastic ,making them great for target work.Others tell me they stick to tee shirts in hot weather , if you holster or IWBcarry . They have a flat finish with the feel of hard tire rubber .I would recommend them ."
5,Nige grip. Comfortable and slightly larger than stock.,"These panels are a nice improvement over the stock ones. They add a little bit of girth for my large hands, and add some additional padding and comfort over the original panels."
5,Super Grips at an Awesome price,"My Sig P226 had the standard plastic molded and pitted grips that comes with the Pistol. I have very large hands and after several times on the range I began noticing that the the grips were getting slippery or too much motion in my hands as perspiration and dirt had collected. Then my search began, I looked for a name that I knew was the best when it came to tactical pistol grips Packmeyer, the price sure as hell made it hurt as well $119.00!!!! I spoke with my small town police-dept. and they said to take a look at the Hogue Rubber grips for $19.00. I ordered a set and installed them, my firearm quickly changed as well as my attitude. What a transition these grips made, the whole look and feel as well as live fire at the range. I have more control over the firearm and the palm feeling is SUPERB! Hands down this is the best feeling and well built grip for a pistol any day of the week, I highly recommend these grips."
4,Nice Boots,"These are nice soft boots. They are easy to put on and don't come off if the velcro tape is fastened securely. The size was fine and they look cute on my little 6 pound Papillon. However, he hates them. He sits down on the sidewalk and refuses to walk. I got the PawZ booties which are like little balloons and he likes these but they are hard to put on. I still like the Muttluks. Perhaps with practice my dog will be able to walk in them. I think plenty of dogs would like these."
2,Birthday Song,"I was looking for a good birthday song, with some spunk to use with the photos shows I make and this was too lame."
5,This B-Rate Thriller + MST3K Treatment = Laughter,"This B-rate thriller is perfect for MST3K. It's been a while, and I need to re-watch it, but I can ensure that this is a good MST3K episode."
3,Right in the middle.,"I have definitely heard worse performances in my life, but I have definitely heard better as well. This album has its moments of greatness, but, unfortunately, most of those are on Scaramouche. The rest of the pieces, especially the Glazounov, are done so-so; they're all right, but not great. Also, on a personal note, I'm not too fond of the full orchestra version of Debussy's Rhapsodie.As for the fan from Korea who basically attacked saxophone players, I suggest that you listen to either ""Saxophone Colors"" by Eugene Rosseau or ""Le Patron of the Saxophone"" by Marcel Mule, then try reviewing again."
3,Wasn't THAT bad....,"Other reviewers have given only 1 star, and I think that is a little unjust. Sohre is technically compotent...my main problem is that there seems to be little musical interpretation--the Glazunov, really a lovely concerto, seems to be lacking the emotion you feel in other recordings. I think the real case here is that you have a decent, not great, saxophonist in Sohre Rahbari, that was able to (apparently) convince her brother and his orchestra to record a CD of sax concertos with her that is now being pawned off as a highly legitimate recording. Not bad, but you can find better recordings out there...."
4,Saxophone and Orchestra review,"I think composers Darius Milhaud and Alexander Glazunov are amazing in their musical expertice. They brilliantly composed these pieces of music with an exceptionly smooth flow. On a down side I, personaly, would have liked softer softs and louder louds. I feel that those sounds capture the listener more effectivly.I also feel that Alexander Rahbari, the Conductor did an exellent jod of controlling his orchestra. Sohre Rahbari was also brilliant in his performance. Again i would have liked softer softs and louder louds. Brussels Belgian Radio & TV Philharmonic Orchestra Essembel was amazing in thier porformance aswell. All in all, I give this sound track a 4 out of 5 for an almost perfect musical score."
1,Good composers Horrible Saxophonist,"I think the musicianship is extrmeley poor overall. There is also horrible intonation and the saxophone made a poor attempt at playing ""with"" the orchestra. This is not a CD worthy of a real saxophonists time or money."
2,binding was broken,We ordered the book and the binding was broken. seller sent another book but it had the same problem
1,SAVE YOUR $$,This is the worst piece of equipment I have ever bought...I can have the two devices almost touching and it still will not work...save your money and just get a longer antenna.
5,Awesome for the office!,"My company decided to block streaming audio into our network, so I was no longer able to listen to XM Radio over the internet. However, I have a MyFi XM Radio...so I can use it wherever I want...as long as I have reception. Since my cube is in the middle of the building I couldn't get reception. I purchased this signal repeater/receiver and placed the repeater in a conference room (with windows) and put the receiver on top of one of my cube walls and it works great! I finally have my XM back!"
3,Does what it's suppopsed to do.,Too bad the xm radio doesn't work in my house. I needed to buy a repeater. It works.
1,Dissapointing,The ad blurb stated 75ft thru walls and floors but the lit in the package made it clear that this was for line of site use. You're better off buying an extension for your antenna.
3,Decent reception,This will get you maybe 50 feet thru walls in a perfect case but with older cordless phones or wireless networks this thing will drop out. Good product but just run the darn wire instead you will be much happier.
4,Delphi Signal Repeater,"This product works like a charm. The instant purchase was for a second antenna, so I can receive the repeater signal in two places in my house. Works great and I would certainly recommend it."
3,"Great a repeater, as long you are NOT trying to send a signal to an XM Inno","The product works great. Unfortunately, I was wanting a repeater that would allow me to use my XM Inno. The Inno has to be in the cradle and then the repeater antennae is attached accordingly. The mobility that I wanted (to just walk around my home with my Inno and get a great signal) is not possible with this device. It is unfortunate that the promotional information from Delphi did not tell me that this was going to be the case."
4,Placement flexibility,"I have used this repeater for three months and it has allowed me to use my XM Polk receiver in an area previously unserved because of no antenna access.The repeater is located about 40 feet from the antenna and relays the XM signal effectively.The placement of the receiver takes a little tuning in but once placed , is almost never interrupted , even with heavy traffic.I would recommend this product if you are having trouble receiving the XM signal in yoour home."
5,Over Five Year Old Repeater Design Still Works with Newest XM Receiver!,"Wow! This Delphi XM Repeater was designed for obsolete XM products from 2005 like Delphi XM Roady, MyFi and SKYFi, but it still works with the newest XM generation of products like the XMp3i Portable Receiver. Was afraid this would not be compatible with the XMp3i Home Dock, but just received the unit, hooked it up and it works flawlessly. Price is great as well -- very happy with this purchase, may get another one for other locations in the house."
4,A must have for deep octagonal type tanks,"Looked around for an extension, since I bought a deep 60 gallon hexagonal tank, you need a longer extension for the intake to get down into the tank for better filtration. I wish power filter companies would automatically include a long extension, especially since it wouldnt cost that much to include it anyway, but thank goodness you can get it here, on Amazon."
5,Exact Fit,"This is what it says it is, fits my filter and works perfectly. It shipped quickly and arrived well packaged."
3,wrong size,"I purchased this extension hoping to extend the filter tube however when I tried to put it on my existing filter Whisper 20 system, the tube was larger than the existing one and would not fit"
3,Up Crap Creek,"Well, I bought the GunCon because I had Area 51 for ps1 and the guns that I originally had broke. I looked online and these were the only ones that I could find. I bought 2 of them for a total of 50 bucks (WOW) and they both arrived about a week late. I popped in Area 51 and WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT the GunCon is not compatible with that game! If I had known this prior to ordering, I would not have purchased them. However, since there seemed to be nothing stating what games these worked for, I had no idea."
3,it was ok,there wasn't enough goodness for me to like it too muchit was an OK movie and i'm glad i rented it for 1.99 instead of buying it for 10 bucksi liked michael :] he looked hot as a woman
4,Good movie with awful actors,"On the recommendation of a buddy I watched this movie called Camp. While it is different than your everyday comedy, it also does hit the masses. I personally am in Theater Technology, but can see the appeal to anyone who knows good music and comedy. I will say one thing's for sure, the actors are terrible at acting. After watching my crappy actors for many hours I can say this qualifies as crap if you critique acting. The cast is young and relatively unknown which shows what a low budget film this was. But remember sometimes it's that crappy acting and low budget that makes you laugh (cheap Japanese movie anyone?). It is evident that these kids were recruited though for their musical ability, which is absolutely amazing to say the least. Also make sure to check out the DVD extras for some great deleted scenes. So, overall, crappy acting, great music and story, but where are the techies?"
1,Masochistic and wrong,"Most of the movie is okay, even enjoyable. However I have to give it one star because I am so disgusted with the moral, which seems to be: It's better to be in a relationship with someone who has no respect for you, no intention of being faithful, and will dump you the second someone prettier comes along than it is to be by yourself.That's sick and it infuriates me, so I cannot have fond memories of this movie. Save your time."
1,"Is there such a thing as ""negative stars"" for a review?","Talk about your bad mistakes. I meant to rent ""Ray"", and somehow this steaming pile of dung ended up in my hands. No lie, this whole movie's budget should have been used to buy food for homeless bums, at least then some good would have resulted from this putrid piece of garbage. I don't say this cause I hate gays, I say it cause I hate dialogue that sounds like it was written by a half-drunk eight-year-old. The acting by the guy named Vlad was stiffer than a wooden plank, and there are so many retarded story lines going on at the same time that you find yourself not giving a rip about if any of these people ended up jumping off a five story building. Do yourself a favor and spend two hours beating your head against a metal pole, cause you will be smarter than watching this movie."
3,Harmless Fluff,"There are very few good gay movies out there.Whole New Thing,Harry and Max,La Cage Aux FollesandAs Luck Would Have Itare some of the only ones worth watching.Now we can add to the list ""Camp"", a cute, harmless little bit of fluff. It doesn't touch on any of the major ""issues"". No one gets AIDS. No one gets gay bashed (well, sort of. Someone does, in a way, at the very begining, but that's about it), and no one dies. Instead people end up in slightly awkward, real-life situations, largly centering around who's sleeping with who (whom?).The acting is decent all around. The film is well-directed and written. The song and dance numbers are servicable. Basically, it's a nice bit of brain-candy. Nothing serious, nothing filling, but a pleasant enough way to pass 105 minutes of your life."
5,BEST MOVIE EVER!!!! :),THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE IN THE WORLD ... I WAS UP AND DANCING AND SINGING! IT IS VERY HAPPY AND ENERGETIC! MY BROTHER (9) AND I (13) LOVED IT AS WELL AS MY MOM (40) AND DAD (42) ALL AGE GROUPS LOVE IT! I LOVE IT !!!!!!!!!!! BUY IT!!!!!!!!! OMG BEST EVER!!!!!! <3 :) <3
1,I wish I could rate - 100 stars,"There are no words to describe how awful this movie was. Yes, the songs and the voices of the actors were fantastic, however the acting was atrocious. I think half of the problem was the writing. The script had no realistic feel to it at all. I found myself laughing histerically at the things the actors said, but it wasn't meant to be funny; I found the things they said unrealistic and funny to the point where I would rewind and watch them say it again. Also, part of the reason there were no good actors in this film, is because I think it is such a rarity to find a young person with amazing vocal talents, as well as a good actor. Overall, I think this movie, was awful, and had NO powerful feel to it whatsoever."
4,OMG - Its Stephen Sondheim,"Good film, definately what performance camps are like - thousands of gay boys and the girls who love them. And then, OMG - Its Stephen Sondheim! If you're into musical theatre AT ALL, check out this film."
5,GREAT!,"I think that this movie was GREAT!!! It was a very heartfelt movie that was also very funny. It definitely lived up to my expectations!!! The singing was awesome and it made me wanna try out for my next school musical!!! And about the acting in this movie... it was actually pretty good, I mean what do you expect? It was an independent film!! Anyways I've seen worse acting (AKA-Gigli) I think that you have to have a certain taste in movies to enjoy this movie and if you are thinking of buying it then I would suggest that you see it first before buying it. Stop by my house, I already own a copy!! PARTY!!<br />ENJOY- As I know you will!! BOOYAH!!!"
3,Heartfelt Mickey and Judy for the Millennium,"CAMP is a charming and catchy show business tale. I didn't realize until I saw this how rare it is to see these backstage musicals these days. The Sondheim songs being performed by young kids who have yet lived enough to any idea what they mean is a hoot! But, the raw talent is hard to resist."
2,"An indie teen movie, for what it's worth","This film has the feel that it was produced at a summer camp for the performing arts. The music and the dancing are good, but the acting seems more ""indie"" than polished.The dialogue is so painfully cliched at points that I found myself groaning aloud. How they got Sondheim to put in a cameo, your guess is as good as mine.The characters wear their hearts on their sleeves with the verve and angst of any ""gifted"" adolescent to the point if you critize the movie, you are as evil and repressive as the evil and repressive parents.It could have been better with decent music and a ""tour"" of some of the better musicals of recent years, but instead it is self-indulgent and awkward -- huh, just like artistic teens...I'm sure someone out there loves this movie. Watch Hedwig instead."
1,Rent first - buy later - if you like it. I wish I had.,"I read the reviews from the critics, and more importantly the ones from buyers at Amazon.com and I must say that I am really upset that I not only spent my money on this dreary, dry, sluggish and not very well acted. I guess somewhere along the line it was a good concept or idea, but what it turned out to be, in my opinion, was a bore-fest in ""campy"" humor. I will say that the lead actor, the person who plays Vlad, had the most potential. I suggest you rent this movie first before plunking down $22 on it. I wish I had."
1,"Well, ""stupid"" is accurate...","I watched this movie with a few friends. One said ""stupid, but fun."" The other said, ""well, stupid..."" Seriously, I don't think I've seen a worse movie in several years. The writing is awful, and the acting is offensive. The creators of this film had an interesting opportunity to make fun of ""campy"" movies and completely blew it. Do I know how this film could have been made better? No, but I'm not a filmmaker. These people are. Learn how to do your jobs.Normally I also review the DVD's special features, but please don't make me watch them!"
2,it's aight,"like a Poor Man's ""Fame"" but with some interesting numbers here&there. not much in terms of writing or Creativity in terms of stretching the actors&Actress's Depth in the film but it was aight."
4,Vlad sucked,"I would give this movie 5 stars if it wasn't for Vlad being a total jerk. I wanted to like him because he SEEMS like a good guy and the hero of the movie. But he flirts with everybody and cheats on everybody. By the end of the movie I wanted to see him get pounded. Other than that, the comedy was great and so was a lot of the drama. I loved the music."
4,HIGH OR LOW,ok all i can say is you either love this film or you hate it. personally i thought the acting was weak but the vocals were amazing and for that alone you can watch this movie over and over again. there is also an adoreable tap number that a 7 year old boys does that just makes you want to go out and learn this talent. but once again it's either a love or hate thing personally i love it
3,umm...,"i don't understand...people complain about how insipid, shallow, and poorly acted this movie is. umm...DUH. there's nothing wrong with a lighthearted, careless musical romp. it never tried to be profound. it's called CAMP for more than one reason...something i think many people forget about this movie.and about not being able to identify with the characters? i disagree. regardless of how much we're allowed to understand of them, i still think it's quite easy to side with them, especially if you're a theater kid of ANY age.let me put it this way: it's worth seeing. if not for the acting and storyline, then for the music and amazing vocal talent here. there's no denying the powerhouses in this movie."
3,Wonderful Musical Performances,Don't watch it for the plot because you will be disappointed. Do watch it for the wonderful budding musical talents found in this young cast. The acting was average but the script wasn't written to discover the next Marlon Brando or Glenn Close. The musical performances came with enough frequency to hold my interest. I would hope to see more of these young people but there isn't a great deal of call for singing and dancing in movies these days. The musical performances were moving and I did laugh at many of the jokes.
2,"It's about kids at a ""musical camp"" for wannabe performers","These are not your typical teens. They love Broadway musicals and want a life of singing and dancing on stage. So here they are at ""Camp Ovation"" honing their skills. One of the teachers is a song songwriter. Because he is also a ""one hit wonder"" he's an angry alcoholic. The other characters (teenagers) are a ""fag hag"", a cross dresser, a chubby girl who has her mouth wired shut, a bleached blonde who thinks too highly of herself and her meek sidekick and a rare straight boy at the camp who lacks self-esteem.There is a three good scenes that made this film worth watching but in general mediocre movie. If you like musicals, you will proberly like this but might bore most people."
2,What a mess!,"This movie is the reason we have video rental stores!! Had I believed most of the comments about this movie and purchased it I would have been very dissapointed! The purpose of this movie is to make the viewer laugh at the stupid situations that the director puts the cast in. I'm surprised that funding for this film would even be made available for such a grade school written script, it's just awful! The young cast however, is exceptional with the exception of all the adult roles."
1,silly and predictible,"Silly, predictable, and over-the-top, this film tries too hard in all the wrong places. It should've focused on a better script and hired more talented actors (although the actors are pretty good singers, their acting abilities are questionable at best). It might pass for a made-for-TV film, but nothing more than that."
1,In the running for the worst movie ever,"Stupid is the only word for it. If only they had had a writer, a director and some kids who could act. But they had none of these. Some of the kids, only some, could sing and/or dance, but none could evoke any believability. Of course they were yoked with a hacknyed, cliched, unfunny script.And please, give me a break! Having been involved in theatre for nearly 50 years I can attest that there are INDEED many gay guys, however, there are always more, by far, ego driven, ""I am god's gift to womankind"" straight morons.BTW, did the casing director go out of their way to cast only unattractive guys in the gay roles?"
3,"Not that bad, but not that good","I didn't know anything about this movie when I went to go see it. It was about a group of kids that go to a camp every year in which they sing songs and put on plays. Everyone in the movie was very talented and the acting was alright. I just thought some of the movie was kind of stupid and I didn't think the movie was really a comedy, there were a few funny parts, but most of it was serious. Not all of the characters were very likeable either, which didn't help. If you're looking to rent a comedy, don't rent this. Only rent this if you want to see a musical and you really like show-toons, which I don't really like."
1,Crap,"Camp takes a horrible look at young actors with a complete misconception: not all actors who attend drama camp are gay! There were a couple of funny parts but overall, this movie was junk. More than that, it was an insult. Funny how a movie about drama could have such bad acting. Hugely forgettable. Don't waste your time. I'm sorry I did."
5,At last!,I have been waiting for the release of this latest album. Stacey sings such beautiful songs with such a sweet purity and the Fred Astaire repertoire is perfectly delivered by her. I cannot get enough of her recordings and guess I'll be waiting for the next one!
4,You Should Dance,"If you liked her other CD's, you will want to get this one. If you like dancing the FoxTrot at all, some of songs are arranged in a suitable tempo to do so (especially the title track and 'I Won't Dance'). If you have never heard any of her recording, this would be a good place to start."
3,Good voice but....,"Well, I'm dissappointed. The reviews were so good. That's what I get for assuming without actually listening to someone's voice first. Kent has a talented voice but, no ""umph"" as far as I'm concerned. I cringe when I here her sing ""I Won't Dance"" because I automatically compare it to Ella Fitzgerald's version. I'll keep listening and maybe it will grow on me. I don't recommend spending your money on it unless you know you adore her already..."
2,Homage to Blossom,"Stacey Kent has a tiny, girlish voice, similar in some ways to the wonderful Blossom Dearie, but without, as far as I can tell, an iota of Dearie's transcendent wit and humor. Kent's album covers, with their glamour girl sheen, reinforce the idea that she takes herself very seriously. This album makes pleasant background music, but it's not a sit down and listen kind of album. The songs don't feel lived in, and she doesn't feel as if she has enough life experience to invest them with the requisite meaning. Still, pleasant sounds are better than unpleasant ones, and for that reason I give it two stars."
2,British Trad with a (very) Nasal Accent.,"What's all the fuss about? Stacey Kent breaks absolutely NO new ground here (or on any other of her other CDs either, for that matter) and sings in such a nasally voice that it obscures whatever other decent vocal attributes she may have.It's hard to imagine what the appeal is."
3,Adenoids,"Usually,adenoids shrink by age nineteen. Stacy must still have a powerful set , as she is very nasal and has difficulty maintaining a note. Observe that most ending phrases are cut so short that the whole word almost escapes recognition"
5,Excellent singer backed by a terrific combo.,"Thanks to other Amazon reviews, I gave Stacy Kent a try. Wow. Great vocal jazz in the style of Diana Krall, but with much better backing by the band. If you are a fan of smooth, small combo jazz, this is a good one."
3,attention!!!!,this book does not cover all sohc engines from 92-95!!!d16a7 and many more are not included.does not cover ecu types as well.very basic book.
4,Good enough for basic troubleshooting,"This book has saved me a lot of shop trips, mainly in the electric components. The wiring diagrams are great and with minor misprints. I will recommend it, though I haven't seen the Cilton manual, but from ... the Haynes is better."
3,I think this book can be better. Pictures too few!,"As I read the halfshafts remove & install, This chapter has no enough pictures to explain the work steps. This book contain too many models(from 1984 to 1995). A lot of chapter customers dn't need this. But they should but it."
4,Haynes repair manual,"Over all the book is very good. That being said, I literally had to remove almost everything under the dash to find the trouble shooting port. I did not know exactly what I was looking for and the description was vague at best. it ended up being wedged behind some kind of relay box that i had to remove to locate. After all said and done it, was great for helping me find the trouble code, and a trip to the local O'Rilley auto for a new O2 senser and all was good. I also used it to replace the timing belt and accessories and a few other little things."
1,not the best quality,"I ordered this cart for my 16 month old son after a trip to a children's museum where he fell in love with a mini shopping cart. I was very excited for the item to arrive. However, when it did I was very disappointed. The wheels were plastic and did not roll smoothly. They scratched the wood floors! The seat is actually a piece of fabric, not plastic like I would have thought. It is not worth the money. I sent it back and I am currently looking for a replacement."
2,toy shopping cart,My grandchild love its but wish I waited and shop around more.to find its cheaper.
5,Great book!!!,"Charlotte's (aka Charlie's) 6th grade year is not coming out to a good start. Mrs. Beckworth is her not-so-great teacher who asigns the 6th graders to write a boring project about the Victorian times. But Charlie has worse problems. Her mom might be getting a boyfriend. And her best friends are getting interested in boys, while Charlie still isn't! How does Charlie survive all this? Read the book to find out. I would recommand this book to sixth graders, especially girls. This is one of my favorite Jacqueline Wilson books!"
4,Skagen Titanium Mens watch,"A nice watch, well made, extremely light weight. Nice styling too. Great deal for the money."
1,disappointing purchase,really only lasted three weeks and my dog is a toy poodle that does not reach 10 pounds. I lost my money. There were holes in all four boots.
5,My pup loves her Muttluks,"Great dog paw boot. Nice fit. EXPENSIVE, but they actually will do what they are supposed to do. No problems with the materials. I had to cut some frayed threads out of the inside of one well used boot, but it was just excess material beyond a seam. A set I purchased a few years ago has a synthetic bottom to the boot, the new set I just received has a leather bottom. I use the boots to protect my dog's paws freezing temperatures, ice, and snow during harsh winter conditions (not for hiking or running) and I guessed that a Canadian dog boot company might know a little about that!. I've also used a boot to protect an injured/healing paw on more that one occasion. Once my dog adjusted to them and stopped walking around like she had a helium balloon tied to each paw, I was totally satisfied with the Muttluks."
1,Worth the purchase if your dog will wear them,The quality on these is very good and I think eventually they will more than serve their purpose. I am just having some difficulties getting my dog to keep them on. Though watching him walk around making big prancing steps when we first put them on him was probably worth the full price of the booties.
2,Not durable and does not stay on,"It took a while for my Dachshund (19 pounds) to become acclimated to this footwear which is understandable since it's not natural for dogs to wear boots. My dog needed them because his paws kept getting injured and bloody. When he finally got used to walking in these booties, I was disappointed how it tore after only 4 walks. I don't recommend this to dogs that pull and drag their feet a lot. I especially don't recommend this to dogs with short legs because the 'neck' of these boots hit right over the knee joint which doesn't allow flexibility. My dog would walk in a stiff manner. If you have a toy breed, I think it would work because they are lighter. This didn't stay on very well though. I had to adjust it 2 or 3 times during our 40 minute walks."
2,These Muttluks could be constructed..,These Muttlucks could have been constructed a bit better. I have a very active Lab who doesn't mind wearing these dog boots. I went to the local park for a fetch with my dog Copper. We played on a grass field with some patches of snow around. We did not hike for hours nor did we go over any rough terrain. But during our fetch the boots started to fall apart. A closer look and I noticed the stitching on two of his boots were going haywire and all bunched up. So I then decided to take the dog boots off and some of those same strings were now stuck to Copper's claws. After a few minutes I did untangle the strings. There were no tears on the boot pads. The boots will protect a dogs paws if they stay together and do not fully fall apart.
2,Not waterproof,"After reading reviews on other websites, I chose Muttluks All-weather boots since my dog has sensitivities to salt and cold. Although they are effective against salt, they do not protect against the cold, and seem to actually make my dogs feet more sensitive to the temperatures. I bought some fleece liners to provide warmth, but the Muttluks are not waterproof - by the time we went around the block the inner liners were wet."
2,Not the best boots around,"Those boots fall apart really fast, unless your dog walks in the grass or on the ground. If you bike with and the dog runs, and he even occasionally stepping on pavement those boots disintegrate within 5-6 runs.Also, the velcro strap is right over the dew claw. Unless you wrap the dew claw in cotton ball, it will scratch the dogs leg bloody.Overall: nice looking quality product without the real purpose"
5,DragonBallZ BUU The Majin Sagas,"This album features many songs from the Buu Saga including some of my favorites ""Evil Buu, Super Buu, Gohan vs Doubler III & IV, Vegeta vs. Goku,"" and many others. This album is definitely worth its price and a perfect piece in the DBZ Soundtrack collection composed by Bruce Faulconer."
4,Hollys book review.,I think Kitten Crowd is brilliant.I espesially like thepart when one of the kittens gets stuck up a tree and nobodycan get it but then the fireman come... Read it to find outif they save the kitten or not
3,There's only one!,The title and the picture are deceiving. I had ordered this expecting to get the pair but only got one. I wasn't given an option to chose between the two so didn't even think twice about it. Very disappointing! The single item is nice though.
3,"Excellent Art, but I want more!","I bought all 4 volumes of this manga series. I absolutely love the artwork throughout the series. However, it seems that the manga could have been continued significantly. The fourth volume ended very abruptly. I really would have liked to see a complete manga retelling of the story, and that's what I was expecting when i bought these books. I was honestly a little disappointed. I can't really afford to pay $25 each for all 13 volumes of the anime..."
5,An enthralling read! Get the rest of the series!,"This book was wonderful! It has everything to make it great; suspense, kidnapping, faith, FBI, romance... Simply Superb! Because of this book, Dee Henderson is my new favorite author! I am getting the rest of the series!"
5,Loved this book!,"""Danger in the Shadows"" was a very good read. I had a hard time putting it down. I would highly recommend this book and the others in the series. I liked that each book centered around a different member of the character's family and the Christian foundations in the books."
5,Danger in the Shadows,It was a very good book. I may need to get some more of her books. It was hard to put it down when it was getting to the end.
2,I confess......I couldn't finish,"It's very rare that I don't finish a book, but this was one of those times. Like other reviewers, I wasn't aware of the very heavy Christian influence in Danger in the Shadows. I have nothing against Christianity or religion in general, but frankly I found the constant praying etc. distracting and didn't have a lot of patience for it. There definately is an audience for this type of theme, and there was nothing wrong with the writing itself, so if you enjoy religious fiction than by all means check it out."
2,Please tag the genre correctly,"Annoyed wrote....""I am getting getting quite frustrated with the lack of proper descriptions on Amazon lately. Religiously themed books should have their OWN category. I read book descriptions thoroughly to avoid religious themes in the books I buy, but yet again I find a Christian book under the thriller category. There are many people who enjoy those types of stories, but since there's not a return option available on the Kindle, I'm annoyed with the lack of a substantially important description of a book as ""Christian fiction"".I have to agree. No where in the description was this mentioned or the book tagged correctly. I'm just glad I got it for free and didn't pay nearly $10, which is the going price now."
1,"no challenge, extremely boring","Unbeleivable story line, shallow characters, altogether boring. Third person unless the characters are praying. I was expecting a mystery or perhaps a romance, this book hinted at both but really contained neither. Only finished it as a friend wanted to include it in a book discussion - came to find out she never finished it either..."
4,Dee Henderson Audiobooks`,I absolutly love all of her books. The O'Mally Series is my favorite. The Audiobooks are really fun to listen to because they have sound effects and the narrator is fairly good. My biggest problem is that they are abriged and many good parts of the story and even some important story lines are missing. If you know the story its annoying and If you dont its a little hard to follow. But the story is good anyway.
3,Good But VERY Religious,"This book had a good story line, which is the only thing that kept me reading this overly religious book. God, Jesus, a prayer, or a bible quote is on almost every page but has nothing to do with the story itself. Every thought for the characters are written like conversations with God. Instead of a simple ""Oh no"" it has phrases like ""Lord, I should have known"" or ""What hatred had festered, God had lanced early.""I enjoyed the mystery and the characters, but I found the amount of religious preaching completely unecessary for a story that had nothing to do with going to church, priests, or a specific religious quest. I almost quit reading 5 times, but I'm stubborn and hate leaving a book unfinished without knowing how it ends."
1,Also annoyed,I 100% agreement with ANNOYED's review. I am also beginning to wonder if Kindle is simply an outlet for Christian-themed books as so many of The books available on Kindle seem to be flogging The Christian agenda.
1,Don't bother,"After reading the synopsis on Amazon and seeing how highly ranked this book was, I took a chance and bought it. The first chapter or two were intriguing, however, after not too long, I started getting frustrated with all the religious references. I am not interested in being preached to during my personal reading time and felt increasingly annoyed at the ongoing religious themes. This type of thing should be made clear in the first line of any synopsis, to avoid aggravation overall disappointment for readers looking for a new read."
1,Painful.,"Glad I picked this up for free; I'd wish for a refund otherwise. Simplistic writing style (lots of tell, little show). Heavyhanded use of religion. Reads like a poor knockoff of Harlequin."
2,Sorry- but I was disappointed,"I just felt like the characters, especially the leading lady, were so canned. It felt like the author was trying to impress us with the ""perfect lady"". Well, I would have liked more realistic characters. I'd also have liked the author to write more about how the characters practiced succesfully and unsuccesfully, their faith in every situation. Sorry- this book didn't do it for me."
3,I like strong women characters,The only reason I'm giving this book 3 stars is that the woman character seems weak at times and strong at other times.In a nut shell I like women that get up dust off the dirt and fight back.Otherwise I really love this story. It flows well and never really dull.
3,Publisher,In response to people saying they felt deceived because they didn't know it was a Christian book...Look at the description of the book below. It mentions how many pages and it mentions who the publisher is. If you aren't familiar with the name-Google it.
5,Christian romance,"A well written story and not ""preachy"" like some Christian books can be. Romance develops in a very difficult situation,dealing with guilt over a dead twin sister and fear of a stalker who kidnapped them both years ago."
5,Fantastic!,I think that this is a great book beginning a fantastic series. If you have not yet read The O'Malley Series you need to!
4,Not Dee's Best but a Worthwhile read,"Honestly, Dee Henderson's other books are worlds better, but this one won't insult your intelligence with bad writing or nothin'... Her style's still nice, the plot's decent, it just doesn't compare to the actual O'Malley Series or even Uncommon Heroes for that matter."
2,Incredibly Unrealistic,"I find it incredibly hard to believe that the FBI could be misled for 25 years, and have no clue as to who the stalker is. The stalker was given was too much credit for intelligence, or the FBI is filled with idiots. Either way, it still bugged me. I gave it two stars instead of one because I liked the emotional byplay between the hero and heroine. I would think twice about reading another book by this author, but she is definitely capable of more."
2,Um... it got kind of redundant and slow,"It was really good at first and I was enjoying it at first. Dee Henderson didn't waist any time in getting the story going but there is just so much in between when the story starts and when the climax starts. I wasn't able to finish the book because I got kind of sick of it. After a while, it's just like, alright, we get. She's falling in love with Adam and he's falling in love with her and praying for her. Thats basically all that happens for the majority of the book. There are so many pointless things going on before even ONE suspence stuff starts. There is a little bit of suspence in it, but you really have to read to get there. I think I might just skip to the end of the book to find out what happens.So if your looking for a good love story, then this is what you should read, but not if your looking for a thriller that hooks you and makes you want to sleep with the light on."
3,Not as good as the rest of the O'Malley series.,"This is an enjoyable and well-written book. However, I did not find it nearly as interesting as any of the other books in the O'Malley series."
5,Great,Wonderful story... Dee Henderson does a great job. I cant wait to read the entire O'Malley series. Didnt want to put it down.
4,couldn't put down,"I loved the book, finished it in one sitting. I loved the way the book sucked me in from the first page. I only gave it 4 stars because of the bible refrences. but even with those i loved the book, author managed to integrate the bible references with the book so well, that i didn't even need to skip the bible parts."
5,Great service,The product was delivered on time and in great shape. Just as advertised. I would recommend this seller to everyone.
3,Entertaining Read,"I've not read any of the O'Malley series, but since this was a prequel and it was free for Kindle, I decided to give it a try. Sara has spent 25 years looking over her shoulder since she was kidnapped as a child and held hostage. I sensed the fear of looking over one's shoulder, but the danger didn't seem real until the end of the book. The characters are likable, but some aspects of the story didn't seem plausible. It was difficult to imagine the FBI investing 25 years in the process of searching for a kidnapper and sheltering Sara without cracking the case. It also seemed difficult to believe that Sara could make millions on writing while staying out of the public eye and essentially having no means to market her books.Still, it was entertaining and I enjoyed the author's style."
2,Good Christian Fiction - Not a Mystery!,"I'm a Christian and enjoy well written, interesting Christian fiction. I also enjoy good, fast-paced mysteries/thrillers. That's what I expected here and certainly didn't get it. I finished more than a third of the book - then had to put it aside and go to something else. Although well written, there is a great deal of repetition and going over the same background again and again. I kept waiting for something interesting (such as the kidnapper resurfacing) to happen - and it never did. Maybe it all happens later but this book is much too slow and insipid in my opinion. I feel like the time I spent in trying to read this was wasted when I could have been enjoying something more interesting and worthwhile. Very disappointed after scanning the other reviews."
3,Enjoyed the novel,This was a wonderful quick read because the mystery of the past intrigues you relentlessly. The action was well written but the romance fell a little flat probably because it was G rated. I thoroughly loved the redemptive spirit led my faith.
5,Terrific Series,"This is one of the books in the O'Malley series. It is filled with romance, mystery and wit. You won't go wrong reading any of the books in this series"
3,I expected more...,"Dee Henderson's books seem to be flying off the shelves of bookstores and libraries and everyone seems to love them! This is the first one I've read - since there was a prequel, I decided to start with that one.Now it appears that this book was just re-released (my copy doesn't have the same cover)and was written earlier, before the O'Malley series. Perhaps that accounts for the fact that it's slow-moving and not as compelling as everyone thinks Dee's books are!I don't read a lot of Christian fiction (see my reviews for what I do read!), and I'm very selective, so perhaps I was just expecting more. The suspense isn't very early in the book and it's not all that suspenseful. The romance was okay, but I guess I was looking for more of a plot. I thought the end would be more exciting than it was.People tell me that the O'Malley series is better and I think I'll give ""The Negotiator"" a try!"
3,None,"I guess I overlooked the keyword ""inspirational"" in the book description. By the time I realized this was a Christian novel I was interested enough in the plot to keep reading. She almost lost me with all the ""for's"" but I am not the type to quit reading halfway through a book. Overall it was pretty good but I could have done without the proselytizing. Also, I cant figure out how this ties into an ""O'Malley"" series...there was never any O'Malley family mentioned whatsoever."
5,A Prequel to the O'Malley Series,"I got this book for free, which is great, but realized I had already read it several years ago!In fact, I read this book after I read the entire O'Malley Series by Dee Henderson. I think it was unavailable before the rest of the series.I'd recommend this book (yes, it is Christian fiction) and the following O'Malley series. Each of the following books goes into the lives of the adopted siblings and are definitely worth the read."
1,Why did this win an award??,"If you're a Christian you'll love this book. There's endless bible passages and prayers. But where's the romance there's no development of their relationship. I guess they're both just really happy to have someone to pray for and talk about God with. The suspense is lost shortly after you begin the book. She was kidnapped and abused when she was a child and one of the kidnappers is still after her after 25yrs! (unrealistic? I think so), that apparently is the plot, that's it. There is only so much I can read about this past abuse and after a while it doesn't endear you to the character anymore. The author is just trying to continue to shock you which I find predictable and boring."
2,Suspense.....WHERE?,"I was very disappointed in this book. From the back cover it sounded fantastic! The suspense did not begin until page 228!!! And even then - it wasn't very suspenseful. When you finally find out who the stalker is, it seems very anti-climactic. It basically just states this is who it is and then continues. We don't know anything about the stalker or why he did what he did...it seemed very unimportant. Also, as far as the romance goes - I don't need hot steamy[]scenes at all, but there at least has to be chemistry - a spark. There doesn't need to be sex to get that point across. However this book made the couple almost seem more like brother & sister. There wasn't much of an attraction at all. I wound up skimming past paragraphs of this book just to be done with it. Very boring, slow and uninteresting. Too bad."
1,BORING!!!!,"The characters are boring and slightly annoying. The kidnapper/stalker doesn't even make sense. You find out near the end that the kidnapper chose this girl solely based on opportunity and wealth, yet you are supposed to believe that he spends the next two decades plotting, stalking, and spending every waking moment obsessing about this girl and wasting the ransom money to do it. HELLO!!!! It's just not believable. Plus, the book is just boring. Nothing happens. Don't waste your time."
2,Danger in the Shadown,Danger in the ShadowsThis book starts out with so much promise. Sara and her twin sister Kim were kidnapped when they were six years old. Kim died and Sara survived. One of the kidnappers is still at large and is still twenty-five years later after Sara. She meets Adam and they fall in love despite all the trials and tribulations. This book held me spellbound for quite a few chapters. Then I got tired of all the God references page after page. Then the suspence fizzled out but the references didn't. If you like me read a book for escapism and enjoyment do not buy this.
4,Danger in the Shadows,I really enjoy Dee Henderson writing. I think this was a good story except it seemed that the couple got together to fast. But I did enjoy it.
5,An inspirational book!,"I loved this book for so many reasons. It explains in great detail the after life and what happens when we pass. I am a very analytical person and try to find fault in all sorts of things in life, but I never found anything wrong with what Sylvia was talking about. I believe all of her words are true and from the Other Side. She truly has a gift and is using it for all the right reasons.-Lianne, 15"
5,An Eyeopener!,"I loved this book! It really opened my eyes to life, death, and everywhere in between. Questions regarding life, death, ghosts, afterlife, reincarnations, and more are finally put to rest. This book brings forth an unseen world that is discernible through the eyes of Sylvia Browne. Supplemented by her own true life events and miracles within her life there is a truth that can't be denied.This book has touched my heart and soul with every emotion. I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone no matter what your beleifs are. Spiritually refreshing!"
2,Preparing for the inevitable journey,"This is a marvelous book for anyone looking for answers to the afterlife. If you are a non-believer, all the more reason to read this book. Not only was it thouroughly enjoyable, it was very believable and informative. I was especially pleased that she mentioned our pets, and how they are there to great us when we cross over. This book gives me goose bumps when I think about it, good goose bumps. I have shared it with several of my friends, and they all loved it. The King of non-believers is even starting to cave in. Humor interspersed with no nonsense facts, made this a book you didn't want to end, or put down."
1,This book is so incredibly silly!,"Sylvia's ideas are so out there, they are utterly ridculous! No wonder she appears on daytime talk shows; that is where she belongs! I have done so much research into this area, and her theories are just plain stupid."
1,Very Dangerous Person...,"I have read four of Sylvia Browne's many books (it seems she pumps them out faster than Arnold Schwarzenegger pumps iron...) and I have to say that her writings are very dangerous. I mean, if you are looking for nothing more than a fairy tale, than have at it, but if you are seeking the TRUTH, know this before you buy any of her books, she discounts about 80% of the King James Version of the Bible. According to Ms. Browne, there is no such thing as Satan, Heaven exists, but Hell does not. If you are a fundamentalist, a conservative Christian, believe that the Bible is the inspired Word of God which should be taken literally, and you are seeking guidance, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME HERE! Better, read Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins new book on End Times Prophecy, it was FABULOUS. Even better yet? Read your Bible! :-)"
5,all questions answered,I found this book to be very helpful. It answered questions I have had for many years.It was easy reading and she used language that was not over the average persons head. I felt she took all the questions I had and answered them. I have read this once and intend to read it again very soon.You will not be dissappointed.
3,The same info...,"Sylvia has written the same book at least four times... whileone was interesting the first time, it was disappointing to buy several of her other books and find very little information thatwas different. Two are so similar, I had to check the book jacket to make sure I wasn't reading the same book !"
1,NEW MATERIAL PLEASE,As I was reading this book I noticed that I had read parts of it before.....Was I Psychic??? NO!I read some of the same stuff in Adventures of a Psychic...Why repeat yourself Slyvia? I found the first couple of chapters o:k. However the rest of the book was the pits......
5,believe it or not...,"this book actually did ""change my life"". I am a recent college graduate who is very scientific minded, but I grew up in a very religious household, so I am at a point in my life where I am quite skeptical of anything pertaining to ""God"" or ""angels"" or ""spirits"", etc. But I have seen Sylvia on Montel Williams, and I was curious enough to buy this book. I am so glad that I did, because whether or not any of it is true, I came away with such a feeling of peace, self-worth, and control over my life, that it was more than worth the price of the book. I have more insight into things I always felt may be true, and I also understand and accept with much more peace things that happen around me and to me. I try now, more than ever, to learn from every experience. The guidance, humor, and warmth make this book a wonderful read. Highly recommended. Thank you, Sylvia!"
4,Be open and this book could help you (or not),"This book was difficult to put down because the subject matter is very intriguing. I can understand why some view this book as trash while others feel it has changed their life. For the scientific among us, this book is hard to swallow. For those religious fundamentalists, this book could seem blasphemous at times. My advice is to be open to what you read. But read all of it. Agree and disagree with whatever you want. Try the exercises. I have and the results have been amazing. Not all of the exercises, but I have been pleasantly suprised with the results of some. I may not believe or agree with everything stated but by at least trying some of the exercises things happenned, an awareness of perspective I didn't have before opened up to me. But if your closed minded, nothing in this book will seem relevant. Try to be open. If your not, don't waste your money."
5,the other side and back,Thank you Sylvia for anserwing alot of question and for and confirming what I already new. I'm still using your book for referance. This book is a must.
5,So positive and interesting,"I wasn't sure about this book when my mom handed it to me, but I couldn't put it down once I started. So many of the things that Sylvia says I feel that already knew but hadn't put them into words. I think that everyone could take something positive away from reading this book, regardless of what you decide you want to accept as 'real'. I highly recommend it to anyone who is wanting to become a more positive person. And she's funny."
3,Author failed to share her new experiences or other examples,"After reading Ms Brown first book, I was looking forward to the opportunity to learn even more about life/death. However, I found myself reading the same stories and examples that were printed in her first novel. It was not until the latter chapters did she further expand on the ideas that were introduced in her first book. She has helped so many find their true purpose, I had hoped that she would share many more stories and situations. I found the mental exercises listed in the book to be very helpful. Entering the mental pictures she suggested was not difficult once you removed the fear of the unknown. It is a good book to read, however, you will find yourself skipping forward past the old examples and situations. She is more than just a psychic, she is a teacher and healer."
5,Exceptional!,"Really, really, really interesting! I honestly couldn't put the book down, it answered so many questions and also confirmed thoughts I had for years. Sylvia Browne is far from being a fanatic, she's well ""grounded"" and speaks her mind in a way that shakes people around her. She teaches us to stop making excuses and feeling victimized, but instead to start learning and appreciating the ""thoughest"" ones. I definitely love her ""bluntness and honesty"", she doesn't want to convince anybody, she simply shares her knowledge. Therefore this book is very well writing, human and extremely witty. Worth reading it, and makes a remarkable gift!"
1,"Aroint thee, heretic!","If this book is believable, we must look at genocidal dictators, rampaging criminals, and drunk drivers as heaven-sent servants of karmic justice. What a divine, holy, and perfect system! Apparently the human race needs an ongoing bloodbath of violent revenge to ascend (three feet above the ground, to be exact) to higher levels of vibration. I guess Jack the Ripper, Ted Bundy, and Jeffrey Dahmer achieved something good after all--their victims deserved it as punishment from misdeeds in previous incarnations. Even the industrialized slaughter during the Nazi Holocaust was necessary, spiritually speaking. Cosmic Law, don't you know.According to Browne, Bill Bradley would win the White House in 2000. She also scowlingly predicted a Gore victory on the Montel Williams show a few days before the election. False prophecies speak for themselves."
1,Superstitious horse manure,More superstitious horse manure from a con artist who plays on people's fears to make a pile of money.
5,I could not put this book down!,"I loved every minute of this book. I have told everyone I know this is a ""must read"" book. I have put some of her advice to use and already feel a peace in my spirit like never before. Thank You Sylvia Browne you have changed my life forever."
5,I loved this book!,"I read this book after my husband had been killed in a car accident. I guess I was kinda looking for some answers/peace of mind. I didn't have the money for a personal reading so I thought this would be the next best thing. Everything she talks about in the book made sense and put my mind at ease. I have become a little more of a spiritul person after all this going on and reading this book had something to do with it. I've always believed in angels and gaurdians, this just confirmed. When you open your mind, body and spirit it will come to you. I feel him with us everyday. He believed in life after death too. I do not read anything and I don't know what made me read this one but I did, and it was one of the best things I've ever done to make me feel better."
3,Life on the Other Side paperback,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""Life on the Other Side"" by Sylvia Browne, it is a fascinating book! However, I ordered it on June 3, 2009 and did not received it until June 26th. 23 DAYS seems like a very long wait for a paperback book!"
2,Wrong,"My fiancé asked me to read this book because she felt that it had helped her with her life and that it would do the same for me. I had seen Sylvia on Montel many times back in the day and thought to myself ""what a crock"". Unfortunately, this held true for this book as well. For a while she had me going, thinking that she truly believed what she was saying, until I got to the end where she makes her predictions for the new millennium. None of which have come true by 2013, and just reaffirmed my belief that NOTHING happens when you die. Your body decays and you, your spirit or whatever dies with it. There is nothing after you die, there is no conscious anything, and it's OVER. I really feel bad that there are people out there like Sylvia taking advantage of others hope (and to a certain extent their money, hey, someone paid for the book, right?)"
5,This Book Is Really Informative And Worth Reading,"my life mate asked me to get this book at the same time i bought one other Sylvia Brown's books. She sat down and started reading this book while i was reading a book of my own. Little did i know that i was not going to be able to read my book, because she kept talking to me every few pages and telling me how good the book was. i just gave up reading mine since she was so excited in this book to tell me about something she read every 15 minutes or so. she thanked me very much for the book and has now read it about three times that i know of to let it all soak in. sylvia brown is a staple in our house and you will see her books on the table or book case for easy access. so all i can say is she just loved this book and learned much from this book. she talks to her friends about her books and lends them out but makes sure she gets them back when they are done. great book and a must read."
5,Totally different view on death..,You make death seem so easy..not to fear it.. My daughter passed away in May and this book helped me believe she is in GOD'S HANDS..THANK YOU
5,Truly a comfort,I really feel so much better after reading this book! So much of what Sylvia writes rings true deep within my own soul. I've even tried a few of the visualization excercises with surprising results! I could not put the book down once I started reading it.
4,Great Inspiration,"While reading this book, I simply couldnt put it down. It's like i went through a spiritual journey. I learned so many techinques and i feel better about my life and my self. I am not scared anymore of what life has to offer me, nor am i scared to die. I have found my spiritual guide- with the help of this book and its been the best thing ever. I am now more aware of things that were mentioned in this book and i hope to learn more by reading her other books. I really reccommend this to anyone is feeling lost with what direction their life is going in."
5,The Other Side And Back,"What a read! Many things make sense for me now that used to leave me feeling empty and alone. Now I know that none of us are alone, and that God really does love us. Thanks to Sylvia for her wonderful insight on life's trials and pitfalls."
2,"Misleading, self serving, repetative throughout","Having experienced tremendous grief at the sudden death of my 21 yr. old son in 1993 and believing in the after life, I reached out to Ms. Brown and other well known people in this field. She continuously states how she just wants to help people, but looking back she wouldn't even speak with me without a hugh payment for 1 hr. of her time irregardless of my grief. I find it hard to have much faith in someone who benefits by the grief of others. The book repeats itself over and over only changing a few words here and there. I would NEVER buy it again or recommend it."
5,Excellent!! Excellent!! and Excellent!,"I have just read the first few chapters and it is amazing! My eyes have been opened. Finally someone to share the truth about the other side. I thank you Sylvia, there where questions that I have been asking since I was a little girl, for example the other side, why I was afraid of death. And the big question ""why am I hear""? Thank you!! And to everyone else read this book!!! Its time that you knew the truth!!!!!!"
5,Truly honest and eye opening.,"Sylvia Browne's book tells you everything needed to know about spirituality and getting closer with our world and the other side .I've recommened this book to everyone who truly believes. It helped guild me through a very difficult time. I can't thank Sylvia enough for writing this book and many others. It has brought me closer with myself and my past and present family. I took a wrong turn in life with the help from Sylvia's book her guidence has taken me on a better path in life and could take you too. I can see clearer now on subjects she talks about such as angels, loved ones, death, fear and the dark side plus so much more. Thank you for bring me closer to God my greatgrandmother, grandmother and mostly myself."
4,That's what I thought!!,"Great book for those of us who have ever questioned things that we were to taught in religious instruction. At last, a book that doesn't instill guilt and fear into others for not fitting the mold of organized, patriarchal religions. Unbiased and accepting as always, Sylvia provides comfort to the reader accompanied by laughs and the knowledge that we will all be loved and accepted in God's light."
5,An incredible journey!,"This is a wonderful book and audio tape. What a wonderful journey everyone will take when reading or listening to this book. It will educate all of you on what the truth is and stop letting guilt,fear and sin make people feel unworthly of Gods love for us. Thank you Sylvia for sharing your gift and helping all of us understand what the ""Otherside and back"" is all about."
4,Inspirational,"I admire Sylvia's integrity, she doesn't seem to be in this field to expand her pocketbook. Her books seem to be honest and sincere. I have a great respect for Sylvia and have enjoyed all of her books. It takes an open mind to grasp the message in her books, I for one agree with her philosophies. I do have to admit ""The Other Side and Back"" was a little redundant, but still offered a lot of new info. I will put it on the shelf with my other favorites...Raymond Moody's new book, ""The Last Laugh,"" is pretty interesting so far...take a look at if you get a chance."
1,convicted of fraud in 1992,"why would anybody take advice from sylvia shoemaker browne?? in 1992 she was convicted of investment fraud and grandtheft; she's probably blowing more smoke and what about all of her many failed predictions such as aliens are going to land at the whitehouse in 2010; did that happen?? and how could she not predict the 9/11 attacks BEFORE they occured?? i'm sorry,but, sylvia shoemaker brown, go blow smoke up somebody else's..."
3,Lacking Predictions,Not exactly a good book for making valid predictions for toward the future. Have to recommend The throne room or The Visionary for that.
1,Po-faced rubbish...explore science instead!,"I underwent the pain of reviewing this superstitious twaddle by one of America's most beloved frauds...and it was truly an ordeal. You don't need such woo-woo to derive wonder and meaning from a Universe rich in complexity and marvelous surprises. I suggest reading ANYthing by the late Carl Sagan, or Dr. Stephen Hawking's new book ""The Grand Design."" Science and reality are SO much more rewarding than the gibberish and mystic mutterings of the peddlers of 'psychics,' channelers and other hucksters."
2,Get It From The Library,"For someone so talented this book was shallow and superficial at best.I suggest getting it from your local library if you really feel you must read it, ... If you really want to know what it's like on the other side look to some of the ""Old Masters"" work such as Edgar Cayce he donated his life to this work and research. Not to a woman who has become a legend in her own mind."
4,Mostly enlightening but some things hard to swallow,"I hoped to read this book and have her finally explain to me all the things I didn't understand about the world.In some cases,like regarding death, she did explain things that no religion has ever explained to my satisfaction.But other explanations, like blueprints, are very hard to accept. I can't believe that everyone specifically chooses who is in their family and what challenges will be in their life. How can I believe an intelligent spirit chose to be born as a crack baby and die 5 minutes later, or believe that spirits choose to be born in abusive families? Maybe I expected too much from a book.But I plan to read her next book and hope that I can understand better.I am certain she was blessed by God and is truly a gifted psychic.But I tend to think some of her ideas about life are well-intentioned but possibly misinterpreted."
1,Please do yourself a favor. Don't buy this junk,Bought this from a different vendor. But wanted to write a review here. I am using this with HC20. Camcorder will say it has a lot of minutes left. But charge drops suddenly. Tested it many time. I now have to try to get it replaced. Don't even know if there is any website for this manufacturer... Wish me luck !Spend a few more $$ and buy original Sony battery.
4,Still up to date?!,"Yes, we were experiencing a paradigm shift and yes, we are probably still in the middle of it. However, unlike stated in this book, six years after this publication ""sustainability"" is not a vague term anymore at all. Everyone who deals with sustainability practices or environmental issues should know by now what the ""new paradigm"" is about.Despite the fact that the sustainability revolution is not as up to date as it might have been in 2005, I liked the scientific writing style. The theoretical content made up for the missing connection between the chapters. If you want to get an idea about the evolution of sustainability: this book is a good start.- Frank Roettgers, author ofGoing Green Together - How to Align Employees with Green Strategies"
5,Building Awareness of the Sustainability Revolution,"This is an interesting book in its positioning of the sustainability movement as a revolution. Let's hope. As the recent movie, the 11th Hour, emphasizes, the challenge before us is to build awareness of sustainability. One way to begin this is to do some self education and, most importantly,begin to identify the PEOPLE who are involved in moving us forward on the sustainability front. This book references ten+ people to include the work of:Stuart CowanAlan DurningCatherine Austin FittsBarbara HarwoodDee HockDavid HolmgrenWes JacksonJaime LernerPaul MacCreadyAllan SavoryGeorge SessionsNancy ToddIn addition to identifying some key players, the book also makes it clearer as to what sustainability encompasses. There are many, many books on the topic, and this is a good one."
4,Excellent reference,"I good overview of the various different positions and definitions of what is sustainability. It's a little dry, but as a reference book this can't be beat."
3,Good book for those still in college,"The title of this book is a little misleading, this is a great resources for those who are still in college and maybe considering what they would like to do with their post-graduate lives. The book has a good listing of classes that students may want to take to help with a chosen career. The listing of careers is rather limited, focusing on the jobs with the greatest potential growth in the 21st century. In all this was not a very helpful book in finding a job, but worth looking at."
4,FINAL ANSWER?,"Easy to figure out the ""bad guy"" in the beginning. Easy to figure out what he was doing. Take away the simple crime solving, and pay attention to adolescent girls."
2,"""Supergroups"" is a misnomer here","Best of the 1970's ""Supergroups""? This is the best group of songs they could come up with? Music from bands like Boston, Kansas, Styx, ELO, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Santana and BTO are great choices. But, who in their right frame of mind would consider Grand Funk, Rare Earth, Sugarloaf, or the Little River Band as ""Supergroups""? Okay, the Little River Band had several hits, but they certainly weren't ""Super"". Some of these bands are so dang obscure that I could DARE most of America to name ONE other hit from half the bands on this disc, and I'd bet they'd pull a brain muscle and hemmorhage trying to do it. 14 total tracks. 7 songs are worthy classics, but the other 7 totally miss the boat. If I were producing a disc with these songs, I definitely would not have used the label ""Supergroups"". Perhaps a more apt title for this CD would be ""Poor Man's Hit & Miss Tunes From The 70's"". Sound production is less than crisp. Makes a nice drink coaster."
2,a few good songs,Sometimes you buy a CD for a few songs. This is a compilation work; there are some good songs that I wanted and just don't play the rest.
2,No Guide or Strategy here,Some explanation about high tech sectors. Then some fundementals used to evaluate companys. This book is a waste of time and money. Dont buy it because of its attractive title.
2,"Okay, but nothing new here!","I'm kind of scratching my head here, wondering if I read the same book as all the five star reviewers. I wanted a bit more of a discussion on risk, I wanted more on how the money he runs has been performing, and a bit more rigor on the decisions as to choose stocks.However, I did like the opening chapter, and the discussion on convertible bonds for high-tech companies, even though both could have done with a little more ""meat"" also.Good for the novice, but anyone with a bit more experience will be frustrated."

4,Aotus: A thorough exlporation of an understudied animal,"In this book, Baer does an excellent job of reviewing research about Aotus. The books seems to lack depth at some points, but this doesn't seem to be the fault of the author, rather of the body of literature available to review. The writing style is succinct and the topics flow from one to the next very well. Much more research is needed on this wonderful and unique animal, and hopefully this book will inspire many to emabark on this exploration."
5,Beautiful and perfect for the petite wrist.,"This is my 5th Skagen watch. I love how thin they are and this size face is perfect for a petite lady who is overwhelmed by the larger face watches. Great price for a Skagen watch, too."
4,Skygen,Luv the watch !! sleek and very classy.The dial is very clear and can see the small stones.They are very glittery small elegant looking stones in side the dial.The dial is metallic not white as I assumed it to be. But it still looks great!The clasp is slightly loose and seems like it would come out easily. Have to get that fixed.I would recommend this watch as a good buy!
5,Lovely watch at a great price,"I ordered this watch from Amazon as it was no longer available in the UK and I was struggling to find another one I liked. I was amazed at the low price. Shipped in just over a week and I am delighted with it, it's very a elegant and simple design, and the crystals make it a bit different."
4,Beautiful watch,"Just received the watch recently and it's just gorgeous. Really very beautiful. I do wish it had a second hand but I knew it didn't when I bought it. Another reviewer mentioned that the closed clasp when you wear it doesn't form a circle around your wrist. It's true, it's kind of square-ish where the clasp is and at first it bothered me but it doesn't anymore. I can't see it unless I turn my wrist over and it doesn't feel weird or anything. Just a minor thing anyway. The watch is not too small, not too big and is thin and sleek. I get compliments on it. I love it!"
5,"incredible price, beautiful watch!","I have a small wrist and this watch is perfect in size for it. It is thin and sleek, very classy!"
3,not water resistant,"I love the styling of this watch, and was not disappointed by its appearance. What does disappoint is that within the first week of wearing it, I discovered that what was supposed to be a water resistant watch (up to some rediculus amount of meters) cannot be worn in the bath or shower without fogging up on the inside for hours. Clearly, water is getting inside and causing this condensation. If it were not for the gorgeous appearance of the watch, I would give it a much lower score because I've never heard of a water resistant watch that cannot take ANY exposure to water."
2,"Lovely to look at, but...","This watch's crystal face is extremely fragile and unprotected around the edges. I bought this watch as a Christmas present for my adult daughter. Shortly after New Year's, the watch was dropped and the crystal cracked several times. Undeterred, I bought a replacement. The new one has a scratched crystal and band after 4 weeks of occasional wear. It was used only as a dress watch and not for daily wear. The product description promises a ""scratch-resistant mineral dial window."" The manufacturer takes no responsibility for damage to exposed crystals and yet they have designed it so that the unprotected crystal sits above the stainless steel casing. Beware."
5,amazing watch for very thin wrists,"I am a tiny Indian girl and I have VERY thin wrists (not even 1 3/4 inches across). Most watches that are recommended as being good on small wrists are comically large on me. This is the only watch I've found after searching various department stores that is the right size to both have a presence and not overwhelm my wrists (and a reasonable price). The only problem I have is that it doesn't show the date which I was hoping for but if that isn't an issue for you and size is, I highly recommend trying this watch."
4,Love at first sight,"I am a petite Asian with thin wrists and this watch just sits perfectly on it. The watch is elegant and goes well with work wear. It's not loud, just discreetly classy. Some of my purchases online had disappoint me when the real thing arrived. Not this one. The real thing looks much much better than the picture. I agree with the other reviewers that the picture doesnt do it justice! It was love at first sight! The only reason why I gave it four stars instead of five is because the watch is not water resistant. I have to constantly remind myself to roll it up when I'm washing my hands. Other than that, it's perfect."
4,"Fun story, good vocabulary builder, music is fine not great",My four year old really enjoys listening to the story and unknowingly has picked up Spanish vocabulary. The book art is good too. I would recommend this for a child who has some (but not necessarily a lot) of familiarity with Spanish.
5,Very good thriller!,"""Don't Answer the Phone is a very suspensful and mysterious thriller. I liked how Alexandra was the main character. The only problem was, her boyfriend, Noah was acting kind of weird. I thought it was kind of scary when the person kept calling her at the SVU Hot-Line. If you have read and liked the other SVU Thrillers, you will love this one!"
5,Fabulous!!!,I thought that it was a really good suspensful book. It kept me on the edge of my seat and I couldn't put it down.
3,Glued to envelope,The item would be a five star if they did not GLUE it to the cardboard envelope.Not sure what that is all about. It took a while to clean off and I still did not get all of it. I used hot water and WD40
2,Useless,"I haven't been able to use it once since I got it. Unless the proportions you are trying to figure out are exactly whats on the wheel, it's useless. Plus...it's not all that intuitively easy to use. Obviously I'm not a ""math"" person or I wouldn't have tried this device, but I can do better with pencil and paper and a calculator. I think I wasted my money."
5,Amco Stainless Steel Recipe Divider Refrigerator Magnet,I bought a total of 4 magnets to stick to my fridge as reference and I find this one helpful to my needs too.
3,Looks nice but...,"Just got this. Excellent service. Nothing to complain about seller. A couple of things though. The 2 square pieces that holds the 3 bands together slides. I don't know if it should be tighter or not but eventually they end up by the clasp. I don't really mind it that much. I bought the bracelet because it didn't look like and ID bracelet. If it starts to bother me, I'll tighten it up with a pair of pliers.The 2nd thing is I think it's a bit expensive at about $20. It's nice but I feel it should be around $15. If I get complements like the other reviewer, then it will be worth the $20."
3,Kind of flimsy,"Does not have that nice jewelry feel to it, but it looks as pictured. Not bad, but not as nice as similarly priced bracelets I have purchased."
1,Don't Buy,I bought these pads a few months ago and they completely destroyed my rotors. They also leave a cake of brake dust each time I drive. Don't buy these pads.
2,Had to Return Them-SO Sad,"These are absolutely adorable, and we love Baby Legs products, but the soft chenille-like fabric unravelled after just one wearing (there are several colors woven together around the logo, and they looked terrible after about 2 hours of wear. The bottom of the legwarmers also doesn't have a banded edge (you can see the edge at the back in the photo), so they don't fit very well unless you wear them upside down. I bought 2 pairs-one for my daughter and one as a baby gift, and returned them both."
3,Baby Legs shed,"I love the color and the material is so soft, but these shed all over the place! I still like to put them on baby though."
5,A REVIEW FOR A PUERTO RICAN FROM A PUERTO RICAN,"I LOVE ASHLEY, AND NO ONE CAN CHANGE MY MIND. I LOVE HER MERENQUE MUSIC, ESPECIALLY THIS ONE. I LISTEN TO ALL HER MUSIC ON ALL PARTIES, ESPECIALLY, ""YO SOY LA BOMBA"" THE RECORD. WHO EVER DOESN'T LIKE IT, OH WELL!!!!!!!"
3,People should learn to read more carefully,"OK People. Look at the description very carefully. It says ""Faceplate and screen protector,"" which means it is a product that protects the screen and faceplate. If it was a faceplate, it would say ""Faceplate, and screen protector.""Plus, anybody who actually looks at the picture can tell it isn't a replacement faceplate....use a little common sense folks. I have one of these on the way and will write a more detailed review when it gets here."
2,Mistake,"I made the mistake of not taking the time to read the full description of this product. I searched for ""faceplate"" as in...replacement faceplate for PSP since mine is cracked and this came up so I bought it. It's just a cover for the PSP. The description should read Face Cover not faceplate. My goof up, I'll give it to my friend's daughter since she doesn't have any protector for her PSP yet. Be sure to read the full description before you buy anything."
4,"This is not a game, it is an accessory.","Well, I bought it and I like it. It's good for keeping the PSP clean, but if you're somewhat clumsy, like me, don't count on this protecting your PSP from falls. I dropped mine a few feet, and I still had to send it in for repair because it stopped reading my game-disks. But for less than ten bucks, it's a decent product."
3,Pops off easily,"This face plate is a great idea, but it pops off very easily. I don't recommend this product."
3,it works,"Not for nothing, I bought this product with my PSP. It works, it does collect dust but that's minor compared to the scratch I would have gotten on my screen the first day.Maybe if you wipe it with a little endust, it will repel the dust particles. Like any other screen TV or Computer they all attract dust. What can I say?"
2,Not durable!,"It worked ok for the first few days after we got it for our dog to play and walk in the snow and on the pavement with snow/salt.We realized that these boots are extremely hard to clean by hand. The salt and sand get stuck on the bottom of the boots because the bottom of the boots are not smooth. They feel like suede/fabric. Unless you toss them in the washing machine after every use, it is very hard to maintain them and dry them.After using for a few weeks, the bottom of the boots began to break. There are holes on the bottom towards the front of the boots (we do keep his nails clipped frequently). They are no longer waterproof anymore. The company's website stated that ""many dogs have worn their Muttluks for over three years"", but it only lasted just over a month for our dog. We never use them on dry pavement or concrete. We only use them to protect his feet from salt when there's snow.The boots are also not very easy to put on. It takes us about 10 min to put all of them on the dog."
5,Winter protection,"Got these for my dog for winter protection from salt, sand, and other chemicals that are used to remove ice as well as for when the ice was still there. They work great. They're don't come off easily and the dog will actually wait to have them put on in the winter. She actually went back in the house one time and wouldn't come out until they were on her. When these wear out I'll be buying another set."
2,No Vista or Windows 7 64-bit support.,"This product served me well on my Windows XP, but with a new computer running Vista, and now Windows 7 (release candidate), I cannot find any drivers for the device. Furthermore, Creative labs has no Vista or Win7 drivers noted on their site, and all I could get from their tech support was an automated reply. Apparently, Creative is not interested in supporting its users who adopt new operating systems.Consider your OS before you buy this. If you plan on buying Vista or Windows 7 in the near future, STAY AWAY from this product.... it WILL NOT WORK!"
2,Could be better,"Bought this with high hopes for video editing. It works fine at converting analog video to DV, but the deal breaker for me was that it ONLY supports Adobe Premiere Elements 2.0. Tried it with Premiere Elements 4.0 to no avail. Assuming it doesn't work with 3.0 either. This device also includes its own import software, which should work for any editing software, but just not for me."
1,Don't Buy The Creative Video Blaster Editor,"I bought the Creative Video Blaster Editor several years ago to edit some family videos. My past experience with Creative Labs products had always been very positive. It worked great when used in conjunction with my old Windows XP desktop PC. Unfortunately, once I transitioned to a VISTA laptop and then to Windows 7, I found out that Creative Labs no longer supports the product with newer Windows Operating Systems. (Drivers and Software Upgrades are not available.) Having paid well over $100 for the Blaster Editor, I feel that Creative Labs has ripped me off! If I could have rated Creative Labs in this review with the star system, I would have given them less than one star!"
2,Need Help,"I have error. Microsoft Windows Pop up. ""Video Capture and Playback Exercier has Stopped Working""A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Window will close the program and notify you if a solution is available.Please help'Creative Video Blaster Editor"
2,Proceed with caution,"I purchased a set of Muttluks in November for my springer spaniel, who constantly gets snow between his paws. Initially I really liked them. The boots on his front paws always seemed to roll over so he would be walking on the yellow cloth part rather than the leather bottom. I used these very infrequently, only when we would go on treks in the deep snow probably about 10 times. It is now two months later and 2 of the 4 have holes in them in the top yellow cloth. Also, snow always tends to accumulate in elastic above the strap, so take them off outside. For the price, I personally wouldn't recommend purchasing them."
4,Cool watch,"I think it's a great looking watch. It's a different style to the norm. The face of the watch is nice, and easy to read the time. The only negative thing is that the scarf is a regular size scarf. I felt that it didn't need to be so long. I have to wrap it around a few times, but overall I'm glad I invested in it."
5,It's funny because it's true,This is an excellent and practical tome. My only complaint is that they didn't include this masterpiece of simplicity:Worst. President. Ever.
2,"A little too country, but still has some cute ideas.","This book contains a lot of projects that seem old fashioned or country-style. It was difficult for me to come up with adaptations for some of them that would make them feel appropriate to give as gifts today. There were some cute ideas that I will use, but overall the ideas in the book weren't too my taste. The book probably wasn't worth the money I spent on it, as I could've found more useful ideas online or in a craft magazine."
4,Tasty Thai Tome,"A book that is both lovely and practical, with a mouth-watering selection of do-able recipes, 64 in all. It includes brief chapters on the history of the food, regional cooking, palace cuisine, and more; and an informative chapter on Thai ingredients describes 48 exotic ingredients, some with photos, from 'agar-agar' to 'water spinach'. The recipe directions are concise and clearly written. I like the fact that the recipes are not overly complicated and the number of ingredients called for in most of the recipes is fairly small. Many of the recipes are simple and in my opinion authentic and non-westernized. One thing they do not tell you is how spicy the resulting dish will be. ""Red Chicken Curry with Bamboo Shoots"" and ""Pumpking Custard"" are my favorites. Last but not least, if you are like me and love the visuals, sumptuous color photos abound, with exquisitely presented food in beautiful (table) settings, some with fascinating antiques or objets-d'art."
2,CONCEPTUAL GUIDE,"The Syngress publication ""Managing Cisco Network Security"" provides a decent collection of concepts pertaining to architecting secured information systems. However, I found the book lacking in examples of creative applications and substantially less comprehensive than documentation available on Cisco System's web site. In this respect, I was disappointed with the publication contents.I would recommend the book to those seeking foundation knowledge in the art of network security while cautioning that expectations of specific Cisco guidance might be better satisfied through research of Cisco repositories."

4,...................,"Yes, there are some graphic depictions of violence in this book. It is also insightful in two keys areas of human interaction, domination and personal/sexual inadequacy, particularly in regard to men needing or wanting to have control over women and their own lives. Wilson details how many must resort to violence to ""prove"" themselves superior and gives credible, psychological reasons for their actions."
4,This watch is nice,I bought it as gift for my boyfriend who I knew would only specifically want a brown leather band. The watch itself is super thin which is what sets it apart....
2,Looks great..but major flaw,"The screen cracked. By itself! This is obviously a design flaw. It was just sitting on the table...and popped! Cracked in half.The repair costs like 35 bucks..Ya right, like I was gonna pay that. I called them and pressed 0, and got the guy to accept that its a design flaw. He even told me its a very common problem for this watch. I still had to pay the 8.95 for return shipping."
3,Michael Madsen is the best,This movie has fun plot twists AND Michael Madsen. What more can you ask for? Too bad we can get it only on VHS.
3,Madsen Makes the Film,"So -- I really REALLY like this movie. But not for the plot. It has a great idea...but then becomes rather cliche. Outside of Madsen, I think the acting is weak, the directing is okay, the writing could have been stronger. Michael Madsen -- as always -- is phenomenal. Understated and reserved, as I have typically seen in his work, I felt he made the film something worth sticking with. I wanted to see how his character developed and how he worked with this multi-faceted role that he brought more depth to than I saw with any of the other actors. For that alone I love the movie. With anyone else in the role of Mickey, I think the movie would not have held my interest."
2,A mediocre direct-to-TV thriller.,"""A house in the hills"" is a quite poor b-thriller shot in Luxenburg to be shown directly on TV. Director Wiederhorn makes an acceptable job creating an suspense atmosphere, but storyline is so poor that often the only aspect that keeps the film working are the performances by Michael Madsen, an usual face in this type of movies, and a Helen Slater trying to get rid of her earlier comedy image. Personally, the only thing that kept me watching was a couple of scenes where Slater appears nude. The rest is not so bad, but certainly it is nothing we have not seen before a thousand times."
5,"Chrysta Peretti runs away, and writes abt. her travels.","When Chrysta Peretti runs away from home to start a new life for herself, away from her huge mother, and obnoxious father, she has no idea how rough life can be on her own. In this book, Chrysta is writing all her accounts down of her journeys, and struggles. When Chrysta moves to Excelsior Springs, Arkansas, she finally realizes what it's like to be loved and cared for, and at last she is able to come to terms with her childhood."
3,This book was about a teenage girl during her rebellion year,This book was really good. It talked a lot about a young teenage girl rebells against her family and friends to be on her own so she decides to run away.I would recommend this book to young adolescents who are thinking about leaving home to live on the streets.It will definitely change their minds.
3,Typical Alger,"This predictable rags to riches story is about Herbert Mason, a fourteen-year-old boy who is left parentless with the death of his mother. He must fend for himself in the world. Being courageous and hard working, Herbert begins to earn money for himself in his small rural town.However, he is adopted by a mean farmer who treats Herbert poorly. Herbert eventually finds the courage to run away. With the help of some friends, he goes to New York City to fend for himself. While there, he becomes gainfully employed and works his way up. During each tribulation (several robbers try to rob him, he is wrongly accused of stealing, etc) he ""tries and trusts"" in God.If you've read other Alger books, you can probably guess what is coming next in this story. There are few surprises. However, the book was mildly entertaining and as always, Alger's characters are honest and forthright."
5,more men than heros,"Very good story, real descriptions of fire life as seen from an outsider who, slowly, join our strange world.I enjoyed the deeply drawn stories of everyday firefighting, with no heros and with all the lacks and concerns of real life.Well written too, with irony and neat descriptions of people in and out the fire station.I am always surprised to read how the fire experiences of a fireman of another country could be similar to mine (italy here)."
2,Didactic tale of a self-proclaimed heroic life,"This book tells of life as a firefighter--which should be exciting--but I found myself bored by much of the story. I think I felt put off by the narrator's somewhat naive and righteous attitude, which also made it difficult for me to empathize with him. While the story is well-written, the narrator/author is painfully self-aware and is in love with the idea of being a hero.Despite my personal opinion, I think this memoir might find its audience in those who are very interested in reading about life as a firefighter."
5,No Liner Notes,"I had bought the Import Album a while back. It didn't have any liner notes with english translation, which I missed. When I read about the American release it led me to believe that it included the same liner notes that the LP had, which I use to have but unfortunately lost. It had the French verse with the English translation on the other side of it. If I had known that the liner notes with the dialogue were not included I would have not purchased it. I still gave this wonderful musical 5 stars because it deserves it. I wasn't going to fault it because the manufacturer was negligent in it's advertisement."
4,"Not the complete soundtrack, but OK nonetheless","I was a bit disappointed to find that some of the songs from the film (e.g. the Gene Kelly songs) were not included in this collection. Still, a fun romp through the mid sixties and some of the upbeat, bossa nova-inspired music of the time."
3,Actually different design than pictured,"What I received was different than the picture and description above. The picture/instructions on the package look like this one, but the saw frame is actually the same as a cheaper Grobet saw (Mascot is a division of Grobet). It has a black rubber handle and no tension nut, just an adjustable-length back. It'll work for my purposes, but I'm disappointed at the difficulty of adjusting blade tension and at the fact it's different than advertised in general."
4,"Good quality material, but doesn't fit a Canon 7-D.","I thought that my Canon 7-D with the 18-135mm lens would fit based on the measurements, but not so. I did like the sturdy material though and hope to find something else in this line to fit."
5,Small But Excellent,Barely fits a Panasonic G1 with kit and 20mm prime lenses. Outstanding quality and very rugged. Highly recommended!
3,The Macarena Monks,"They say all Spain is going crazy about these monks, well they might because there are some subtle ""tibet monk"" oriental sounds amid macarena and other westlike rhytms and trends. I am not saying it is not worth, I am just warning: do not expect buddhist monk purity in sound and style."
2,Loudness War Mastering,"Please note this is a review of the sound quality only, not the music. If sound quality is unimportant to you, no need to read any further.Unfortunately this disk suffers from clipping and compression as a result of a desire to make it louder then the average jazz disk. they do this so they get your attention when the disk comes on if it is in rotation or if you have it in a playlist. Of course they don't think people know how to work the volume knob or will be able to figure out replaygain or it's equivalent. So they make this cynical move, knowing the sound quality will be degraded. I guess in the music production world quality is not job 1, volume is.anyway, for more info look up 'loudness war' at wikipedia or google 'pleasurize music' or 'turnmeup'."
3,Nothing New Here.,"I admire David Sklansky very much and think that his attitude towards living the gambling life is b-lls out, but I do not think this book was worth the money I paid for it. Contingent to winning, with Sklansky, is that you, as reader, have the ability to count cards. Without it, you won't get any advantage over the house by reading Sklansky Talks Blackjack. The book's organization and use of pictured cards is useful but the author's offering nothing new here that can't be obtained by knowing basic strategy. Sadly, he provides no original or intellectual take on dealing with the 5 and 6 deck shoes that all of us-- outside of the gambling Meccas-- must deal with. I wish that he had."
2,not worth the money,"conceptually the book is well thought out.playing blackjack is an exact science unlike poker where one has to judge the quality of opponents. describing deck situations as ""slightly"" ""moderatly"" ""highly"" is not appropriate when we know exactly when to deviate from basic strategy.a much better book is ""knock-out"" blackjack if card counting is your aim or ""blackjack bluebook"" if recreational blackjack is your game"
3,Good for storage,"The retractable power cord is great for storage. The iron is light weight but it does not get hot enough for linen and cotton. Guess you could also call the performance ""light weight""."
4,Very listenable,"I bought this CD after hearing just a very brief snippet about it on NPR, and I have not been disappointed! I found it to be very listenable; very lively, upbeat, and danceable. It makes you feel as if you have been transported to Reunion itself --- it's warm and breezy, where the pace of life is slower, and the small things in life are more important. I am about to purchase a few more copies as gifts --- I recommend you try it!"
3,Almost Great!,"This book is very good up to two thirds of the story. Then the plot turns into implausive or impossible if you care for stories that have to make sense. Good reading nonetheless, at least in a sense that is different than what's available nowadays."
3,Overall good but read below,I'm not sure if I got a dud or this is just how they are made. The spring does not always connect the two ends to the in-line fuse which causes the radar to go on and off. I used electrical tape to get my to work for the most part. I have had it go on and off when I hit large bumps. It's still better than having the curly cord hang down in the middle of your vehicle.
4,Does the job - works well - way too much wire,"the wire was VERY LONG. I only needed about 8"" of it to wire the escort up to my mirror which has power for the map lights in my corvette.In the end what you're paying for is the socket that goes into the escort, that's it. The wire itself IS flat which is a plus if you need to conceal it which is what I did through the headliner. I didn't even use the fuse that comes with it. I cut the wire down to about 8"", and then spliced the small little wires into my harness - done....Much cheaper than other corvette specific items (corvette tax)"
5,Great product.,This power cord was easy to hook up and was easy to conceal. Just make sure you know what you are doing before you try to install it your self. Oh yeah and its plenty long.
2,Not worth the $$$,You can use a telephone cord and do the exact same thing. Red for power and Green for ground. Other 2 wires not used.
2,So So,"The soft ware is way out of date,misses most of the cameras around the Washington DC area,and it has yet to pick up the state police running traps.For the cost I would have thought it would have been better then it seems to be."
3,Item not as Pictured,"In the picture, it shows that this item has status lights and a mute button built-in. When I recieved the product it is nothing more than a wire that goes to the fuse-box. Not a huge deal for me, but if you are looking for the fully functional ""official"" Escort 8500 Power cord with all the options, look elsewhere."
4,Escort Direct Wire Cord for BEL/Escort,See my review of the Escort Visor Clip for which this item is included. I only gave 4 stars for all items as nothing is perfect.
4,great,nice product work perfect for me just hooked right up.was easy to hide in my truck. Handy not have to turn on every time.
5,Wonderful Look at the Japanese People,I read this book for a Japanese History class. The book covers from 1600 to about 1990 the lives of famous and ordinary Japanese men and women. It was refreshing to read about how the political side of history has impacted people and society. Highly recommended!
3,Get job done,"Item arrived on time. It works like its suppose to. Sometimes cord get stuck, but you just take your time and wiggle it comes out."
4,Satisified,"I love the appearance of the watch! It was somewhat difficult to figure out how to loosen the straps initially, but now it is a piece of cake."
3,"Love, love, love this pretty watch, but...","This watch is so beautiful and everything I was looking for. I know it would be perfect for everyday wear as well as dress up wear. The mesh band is gorgeous on the wrist and the crystal number indicators are beautiful.My problem is the clasp. I've tried every which way to adjust it. The instructions are as simple as they come, there is no way you can misunderstand how to make the adjustments...Lift, Shift, Press. That being said, mine will not press down and lock into place. I'm made sure that the clasp is in one of the indentions on the back and still it will not lock. I'm so beyond bummed out! I've messed around with it 3 times now, setting it down and walking away in frustration, hoping next time I might hit the magic lock. I haven't even been able to wear it :(Unfortunately, I'll be sending this back, but with reluctance because of how much I like the watch."
2,"Cheap construction, lousy service.",I bought this model because it looks great. I paid $100 for it from one of the department stores. From the day I bought it the watch has lost about 10 to 15 minutes a day. I thought it was the battery so I replaced it for $10 but that didn't help. In order to get it repaired I had to send it to Skagen via special delivery which cost me $12 more. I checked my mail today and they sent me a letter asking for $8.95 for the cost of repairs or else I won't get the watch back. I'm trying to figure out why I'm being asked to pay for repairs for a watch that is clearly under warranty. I'll be calling them tomorow to find out. In the meantime.. don't buy a Skagen watch unless you like cheap junk and lousy service.
2,Beware cheap clasp,Nice watch but the flimsy metal clasp broke after 3 months. I took it back to the store. They fixed it but changed me for it. It's broken again after another 3 months.
4,Nice Watch,"This is the third Skagen watch I have purchased from Amazon. The mesh band is my favorite kind of band, the watches are well made and look good."
3,nice face shame about the clasp,"It's a lovely classy looking watch - not big - not titchy - just a good looking everyday watch. Very stylish. BUT, the clasp is a kicker. I can't put it on by myself, and I'm not that physically challenged. I have no confidence it won't fall off my wrist. I think the designer has gone a little overboard trying to be a bit too tricky with what can be put up for sale and reducing the overall 'goodness' of this otherwise excellent watch."
4,Great watch,"I love this watch! It has a very low profile, and looks very, very elegant. The crystals shine and sparkle. The mesh band is also wonderful--very comfortable.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because once while washing my hands I splashed water on it and condensation formed under the glass. It went away after a day, but I have to question the water resistance level. Now I just take it off when washing something or near water."
4,Beautiful Watch,The watch came beautifully packaged and the design is sleek and slim. It is very lightweight and the face is easy to read. I would buy another watch from this manufacturer.
3,Very nice but not my style,The watch is very nice. Great quality for the low price. Nice and thin. Very light weight. Didn't even feel like I was wearing a watch. It just wasn't my style. Too conservative I guess. Will be exchanging for something a little more bulky looking.
1,cheap,"I was very disappointed with this watch. It looks cheap, fake, I'm not sure how to describe it. Skagen are know to be thin watches, this was not thin and the wrist band looked too silver as if it wasn't stainless steel. I had to return it, even though I paid a lot less than the department store. I will save up my money and get the 'real' thing."
3,Very fragile crystal face.,"While the watch is very nice looking and comfortable, the crystal face of the watch cracked after a short fall to my bathroom floor. This happened a week after I bought it so needless to say I wasn't very happy. Doesn't seem to be a very practical, everyday sort of watch. Nice for a very gentle evening out :)"
2,Too small,"Too small. Completely disappointed. Cant return because live abroad. It is too much complicated. Next time, will buy only after take a look at a shop. The picture makes you think it is much bigger."
4,Goes With Everything,"This isn't my everyday watch,but it is the watch that I wear when I meet friends for lunch or go out for a day of shopping. I've owned it for over 3 years and like it a lot. The features I love is its low profile, silver tone mesh band, the relatively large numbers on its face, and the fact that I still have the original battery in it and it keeps good time. My only complaint is the latch that fastens it took a little time to get used to, but I got used to it quickly.This watch goes with everything because it is both sporty but also works in a more formal environment. I own a similar one in a gold finish that is used with gold jewelry.I've received a lot of compliments on this watch. People seem to like the fact that it is thin and compact looking."
5,Very Pretty,I gave this to my mom for Christmas. The original price on the box is $100.00. It left it on...LOL. I looks beautiful and she loved it. I never heard of Skagen but I will look them up in the future if I need a ladies watch.
5,Great Watch...Great Price,I got this watch for my wife as her xmas gift.she loved it. Skagen watches are great buys...amazing quality.
5,Awesome product,"Beautiful watch. Only thing is amazon lowered it's price 2 day after I bought the watch. Watch was as described. Love the elegant look of the watch, with crystals index!!"
4,Nice watch!,"This is a very pretty watch, especially for the price. It has a thin dial and nice band. The only down side is that it is made for a larger wrist size than mine. I had read the reviews that others wrote and thought that it would be an easy fix, but it appears it will need to be taken to a shop to be made smaller, if it can be done. So, this has to factor into the cost. That is why I only gave it four stars instead of five. I have a small wrist and lots of bracelets are too large as well off the shelf, so keep this in mind when buying."
5,Girlfriend loved it,Bought this as a christmass gift for my girlfriend. It looks great (even better than the picture) and my girlfriend loved it! It was also very easy to adjust for her wrist.
5,Beautiful Watch!,"This watch is beautiful! It's sharp and modern. I love the sparkly crystals markers, and how easy is was to adjust the mesh band to my wrist. I hardly feel it when I have it on and love how thin it is. The watch also feels very secure when on my wrist and, I have no worries that it will fall off if locked on correctly. It is very easy to set the time and works lovely! I would definitely recommend a Skagen watch to anyone who has a clean, and simply beautiful taste."
2,"I like the watch, hate the latch.","I am actually sorry I bought this watch. It is very pretty, and I like that very much, but it just falls off my wrist every time I try to wear it. I am sure I will lose it. I may try to have the catch altered, but I hate to throw good money after bad."
4,judy,I am mostly satisfied with this watch. I have found that the band is not as wonderfully flexible as a couple of my other skagen watches which are black and expresso in color. I do like the way it looks. Overall I like it very much.
5,A very nice watch!,"I wanted an everyday watch and a nice dress watch. I think this choice was the best one I made although it took me almost 2 months to make a decision. I loved the watch from the day 1 and I'm still happy with it. It's very nice, matches with amost anything I wear. I liked a comment that a lady from Macy's had: ""this watch has the right amount of stones in it - you don't want more and you don't want less"". She was right. You will receive many compliments if you have this watch on... this is a promiss!"
1,WHY IS THE BATTERY NOT INCLUDED?!?!?,"I lost my Skagen watch, so I ordered this one as a quick replacement. Therefore, I need it ASAP. I don't have time to spend more $$ and take this to someone to change the batterry. This is ridiculous! Every watch I buy, the battery is included. I had to try to pop open the back by myself, and I ended up cutting my thumb open with a knife. Still haven't gotten the back open yet. Awful."
4,Very elegant.,"Was very pleased with this purchase. it is beautifully crafted and very elegant. I have only worn it a couple of times so cannot speak to whether it is durable and has a good battery this is why I gave it 4 stars otherwise I would give it five stars for appearance, and price."
2,Not durable at all,"I bought this watch and initially loved it. Very pretty. Very simple. Extremely comfortable.However, the mesh is a bit delicate for everyday wear. I don't know what happened exactly, but after a few weeks of wear the corner of the mesh strap caught on something and I got a really bad bend in the middle of the strap. Its impossible to shape it back together once this happens. And the threads of the mesh are super sharp when they come apart like this, so in addition to being obviously damaged, its unwearable.I have to send it back to Skagen now. We'll see how the customer service is."
2,"Great Appearance, Lacking as a watch","I purchased this watch for my wife and have to say that I was happy with the appearance of the watch. My brother purchased a watch from Skagen and I have always liked the way it looked. He didn't have any problems with his, but my experience wasn't so positive. The watch I purchased had a clasp that was unnecessarily difficult to buckle and so it was sent back and replaced. The replacement watch had a clasp that worked well, but the watch can't keep time. It falls behind 10-15 minutes per week. I would think that constructing a watch that stayed on time would be a primary objective for a watch manufacturer."
2,color is coming off,At first when I got the watch and wore it I got a lot of compliments. Now the metal color is coming off and I haven't worn it that much. I am very disappointed at this time and will never order another watch again of the particular brand.
5,Love Skagen Watches,"I actually bought this as a gift because I have the identical watch that I purchased at Macy's. It is light, stylish and waterproof. Waterproof was one of my criteria when I was looking for a watch so that I can wear it on vacation. I love my watch! I would highly recommend Skagen."
5,She likes it,"I bought this as a gift for my wife. (I have the matching male version.) Many older reviews complained about poor clasps, but the clasps on these are good (a sort of double-locked mechanism), so my guess is that they have been redesigned due to the earlier problems."
2,Beware! Not water resistant,"Watch is beautiful, but we were very disappointed to discover that the owner's manual reads, ""Please check the back of your watch for the water-resistant rating"". The manual states that no marking indicates that the watch is not water resistant. This watch has no marking, even though the product description on Amazon states that it is water resistant."
3,Skagen mesh band watch,"I have had two of the Skagen mesh band watches, one copper and one steel. They were both very attractive and kept good time. However, they each had an early burial since the mesh band began to unravel around the watch face. This caused snagging on anything near by. Tried to repair it but that didn't work, so into the garbage. Won't buy Skagen again."
2,by bjs,"This watch is a bit of a disappointment. The face is not as thin as I expected for a Skagen watch and the overall quality does not appear to be the same. My husband has a Skagen watch with a similar mesh band which is a better quality and it has a much thinner face. Also, the ring around the watch face is a darker grayish color and not silver/steel as I expected from the photo. The clasp is a bit difficult to open and close, but seems secure enough. I have not worn it yet so cannot comment on how it keeps time. It looks as though it will not wear well, but hopefully that will not be the case."
2,disappointed,"Watch is gogeous. Price is great, The clasp/closure the worst. Had to have a professional change it to size as I could not understan the directions. Wore it twice and it fell off again. Retuned it. . . Disappointed."
4,excellent watch for all-round wear,"This is the second or third Skagen I have owned over 15 years, and I have to say, for the price it cannot be beat by any brand. It is well-designed and light. I have had allergic reactions to other metals and leather wristbands but these watches are no problem for me. They are not waterproof, though if you get water on it and clean it off right away, you won't have a problem. I did need to replace the battery once in 6 years, but that's nothing. Now I need a new one because the band has gotten damaged and snags on clothing. It was a gift so I am sad, but pleased I can get the same one again. Let's hope it's as good as this one was."
3,Not great in sweaty summer weather,"I love the way this watch looks, but I've had two, and after a year, the crystals came unglued in hot weather and wouldn't stick back on permenently. Since I'd paid $100 for each, that was a huge drawback. So I wouldn't recommend this style for anyone who's active in summer or lives where the weather gets really hot. Eventually, I went to another style of Skagen watch, and have been pleased with it."
3,Watch out for water!!!!,"This is a beautiful watch that I am aesthetically pleased with.....HOWEVER, the advertising is WRONG. The Amazon Skagen page says that it is 100METERS deep water resistant and then in another place on this same page it says that it is 100FEET deep water resistant. But the truth is that it is not water resistant AT ALL. The watch comes with a tiny pamphlet that says the watch's water proof rating, stating that this information is printed on the back of the watch. The pamphlet also says that if there is nothing about water resistance written on the back of the watch ( meaning, doesnt say 100m/ 30m) then it ISN'T water resistant. Well, as it turns out the watch says nothing about water resistance and is thus NOT WATER RESISTANT. Bummer :("
3,Erroneous Amazon Description,"I'm sure this is a fine watch, but I needed one with a date display. The Amazon specification says ""Calendar: date"" but there is no date display on the watch. The only ladies Skagen model I found with a date readout is 355SGSC."
1,Unless you're a fan...,"Unless you're a fan... I really wouldn't bother with this film unless you are a fan of the folks involved. For my tastes, this was not even a ""B Movie, but a ""B- movie"" (Can you have a ""C Movie""?) If this was a parody, the humor was lost on me. WOM (waste of money) }:o("
5,The desert will never look the same.,"I held onto this book before reading it, not sure if it would satisfy the urge to ""escape"" fully into a good story, The story begins by subtly drawing the reader into the life of Maggie and what type of world she lives in. Divorce, submission to others, a rootless existence. Maggie is the epitome of a tumbleweed rolling through an endless desert. She, along with the reader, gets pulled into life in the Rincon mountains with each new discovery of magic under the mundane. True, some of the symbolism has been written about elsewhere, but the reader looking for an engrossing, imagination-provoking read will not be disappointed."
3,I must've missed something,"I read this book because of the great acclaim it has received. I was disappointed. Why, I'm not sure. Beautifully written, wonderful landscape, interesting world-building, and yet I kept feeling like I was missing something. Even after everything was ""explained,"" I still felt somewhat confused, like I'd accidently skipped a page. Maybe it just wasn't my cup of tea."
3,"Interesting story, but too predictable","The Wood Wife is an interesting tale that encompassed beautiful prose. However, although the story had potential, Windling ruins it for her reader by throwing in too many clues before things happen. Her chapters all end with some shift to the fantasy world, which not only disjaunts her prose, but also gives the readers information about conflicts before she resolves them. Just when the story is coming to a climax of the fantasy world, she throws in a love story between the characters of Maggie and Fox, which distracts from the original mystery enough to change the tone of the novel from a wonderful science fiction story ending to a cop out romance. It removes all power and the believability from her ending. If you are one who doesn't catch on too quickly to symbolism, the story would be pretty fascinating, but if you are looking for something that you really want to think and ponder about, it's not Windling's book."
4,Love the Watch - Replacement bands are a problem,"I have owned this watch for 5+ years and love it. The downside is that it has a special screw-in leather band, which will eventually wear out. I am on my second band, which now needs replacing, and can't locate anywhere that has it in stock."
1,Disappointed,"Nice looking watch, a little small. It worked for 12 hours, went to a jeweler to replace battery (needs a special tool to open) jeweler replaced battery it still did not work. Returned & Amazon gave a full refund."
1,Worst watch I've ever owned,Only runs half the time. Runs for three or four hours then stops. The crystal broke after 1 week. Don't waste your money.
2,Easily broken?,Crystal broke easily and cost more to have fixed than I paid for the original watch. Great look and feel however. Time keeping seems to be perfect.
3,Crystal scratches easily,This is a sharp watch and I get compliments on it but the crystal scratches easily. You don't know what did it or when it happened you just look at it and see another new scratch. I have an older Skagen that no longer works and has many signs of wear but no crystal scratches at all.
1,Cheap...,"I bought this watch last week, it showed up in a couple of days, but I hated it. I was looking for a simple, modern watch, and the photos make it look like it might fit the bill, but the band is a cheap leather imitation like you'd see on a child's watch, and the overall impression was flimsy as opposed to sleek. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."
2,Misleading pictures .,The watch looks much bigger and heavier online but in fact it's lighter and smaller. Ok watch. I removed a second watch from my wish list and returned this one. I will not buy this watch brand.
5,great,A very nice beginner kit bought as a gift for my daughter and her kids. They are learning together. She is very happy.
3,Ok book,"I own this book, it's a decent book but I wouldn't recommend it to someone that's looking for basic information. I do like this book and found things that were of help to me but I was looking for a step by step how to and this simply isn't it."
2,screenprinting book good for hooby crafters,"As a screenprinting teacher, I am always on the lookout for good screenprinting manuals to recommend to my students. Unfortunately, this is not one. It is an OK book if you know NOTHING about screenprinting and want to do it for a hobby to make some cards or do projects with your kids, but I do not recommend it for someone who is looking to get into screenprinting more seriously."
5,Great for beginners,"I haven't screenprinted anything for over twenty years. Annie Stromquist made me feel secure in my abilities. She covers the basics and gets you started in the more involved methods. The gallery of images that have been screenprinted is inspiring. I want to screenprint on everything, now."
3,Average,"Charlotte need's help paying for sick father's bill, so she arranged to marry Seth, who agrees to pay her monthly for exchange of her unlimited travel benefits that spouses of airline workers receive, since he has to travel so much. They first meet on a plane, where they end up getting into a argument. They meet up again where they both are in the same wedding, and strike up the deal that day. The book was ok, but not enough romance in my opinion. The couple rarely spent any time together, and the storyline moved kind of fast."
1,Do not purchase this phone,When talking on this phone you can hear your own voice so loud it is annoying. The hang up button is located in the spot where your cheek hits the phone if you rest the phone on your shoulder so I have hung up on people countless times. The phone does not hold a charge for long. I am looking to buy a new phone and will never buy this brand again. It is the WORST phone I have ever owned.
4,Almost,"The book spends a lot of time talking about the background of where these techniques came from and while interesting, more space spent on implementing thes ideas offered would have been more beneficial. Overall the information is there to be used and with an inventive imagination one can develop an arsenal of schemes to be effective in confrontational situations."
2,No depth of content. Written for below average intelligence.,"This book is written for people who lack basic social interaction skills or have been trained to amplify everyday situations rather than defuse them. I finished the book simply because I bought it, if you find yourself unable to conduct yourself personally or professionally consistently in arguments unable to interact with upset people or you yourself upset people and you don't know why than maybe buy this book, but don't count on it helping you.It's no wonder most law enforcement find themselves escalating situations because they were told to read this crap. I certainly hope the authors seminars/classes are better than this, but I doubt it. This book illustrates what is wrong with our governments training of law enforcement."
3,Verbal Judo,"More of a higher level read, I've read bits and pieces so far and I really wish there were a shorter nuts and bolts version for instructors wanting to implement the verbal strategies into their curriculum."
3,Captures Traditional People Management Skills from the Eye of Law Enforcement,The author uses his law enforcement background and experience to relate multiple people management skills. The book is an easy read and I advise the Kindle version rather than the paperback.
2,Repeats itself too much,This book spends more time telling what you're going to read than the actual material you're supposed to learn. I returned the copy because the jacket was damaged but with no regrets or replacement.
2,This may not be for civilians,"Maybe this is a great book for a cop, corrections officer or someone in the military, but I do not think it works well in ""civilian"" life. The only reason I am keeping it is because my husband is a soldier and thinking about becoming a cop when he retires.The examples George J. Thompson uses, are not even used in every day life. Like I said, this book has not made me feel like I can persuade any better than before. I do not feel I can handle a situation with verbal attacks any differently than I have in the past.If you are a civilian, I would say, save your money..."
2,Verbal,"Not what I was expecting. Good basic information for the beginner or those who deal with direct conflict on a daily basis. For the business setting with experience this was only of slight intrest and value. Will need to investigate the book for ""business"" application(s)"
4,Verbal Judo,This book is very informative and shows how situations can usually be resolved with proper communication instead of having to resort to violence. It is well worth reading no matter what your occupation.
2,very disappointing,"Lots of anecdotes, lots of sales-talk about the value of verbal judo, but very little practical instruction. There is one section of what might be called verbal throws, but these dont seem like they will work in real life, e.g. telling your kids that they should go to bed at their bedtime because they'll be rested and feel better tomorrow, and that you have to be a good parent. Does that work on your kids? I read at least a third of the book before giving up on it. If I get a third of the way through a book and still havent learned anything of value I stop reading it."
4,Verbal Judo: The Gentle Art of Persuasion,"The underlying premise of the book is to teach reactive, control type personalities to think before they say something that they will later regret and to channel their impulsive verbal behavior to more positive outcomes.This is done with a series of substitutions of mental pauses and alternative response paths to what would otherwise be common reactive behaviors.The author is uniquely qualified for this task and explains the processes and reasons for the processes of what he calls Verbal Judo with wonderful stories and analogies that illustrate his points, having apparently, spent the better part of his early life verbally reacting to situations with all the predictable negative outcomes that he intersperses so eloquently in the text."
3,Nothing You Haven't Heard Before,"This book is definitely written for police officers (every example he uses is law enforcement related). Having said that, he doesn't say anything in the book that you weren't taught in the academy or in life. I had to force myself to finish it for the point of finishing it, but I was quite bored throughout. However, the concepts in the book do work and are pretty valid."
4,good insights into improving your communication,"Verbal Judo is an excellent book that presents techniques that anyone can use to help defuse tense situations with language. It also helps you understand how to be a better communicator with people in general. I like the stories and examples the authors use to demonstrate the technique, because it shows how it can work and what to do to make it work. The book is broken into small chapters which makes for easy reading, but I recommend taking your time and trying out the techniques. It is a little slow at the start and the authors do a bit of ego stroking, but overall the book is good."
3,Good theory but not enough practical suggestions for civilians,Doc. Thompson has made a good effort at what is a truly difficult subject: talking your way out of trouble. The theoretical aspect of his work get 4/5 stars and I think anyone with training in mediation or negotiation will agree. The examples given relate almost solely to law enforcement scenarios so if you are a LEO then this book might be more useful to you. If you are however a civilian who can't back up your words with the power of arrest or a couple brothers in blue then you may find the examples a bit lacking for your scenario. I still think it is worth reading and then it will be up to the reader to apply it to his or her own particular context.
5,Fantastic Book,This is a really great book. It is extremely useful and I think anyone who has to deal with people should read it. It is also very funny.Kindle app for mac is excellent.
5,Wonderful Book!,"I was so excited to see another book by the authors of Baby Signs and Baby Minds. This book was a wonderful addition to add to my ""parenting library"". It is very easy to read. I want to give my three children the best start possible and I feel that this book is a great tool for helping me do just that!"
4,A strong finish to the triligy!,A thought-provoking and insightful read. Baby Hearts really gets down to the important basics of parenting that address the emotional needs of our children. The information presented can be quickly and easily digested and incorporated into daily life - a necessity for all parents! I was especially interested in the section that spoke about the emotional adjustment that a child goes through when a new sibling comes along.I am heartened by Drs Goodwyn and Accredolo's insight in recognizing the comparable void of user-friendly literature in this area.
5,Baby Hearts,"Drs. Acredolo and Goodwyn continue to provide parents with insightful, educationally-sound, and loving advice and support in their new book, Baby Hearts. Like I did when I read Baby Signs, and Baby Minds, Baby Hearts made me take a look at my own parenting style. It was reaffirming to know that what feels right intuitively actually has research to support it. Our young children are so impressionable and our interactions with them each day are so important. This is a must-read book for parents and caregivers! It is easy to read- even if it's just a few pages at a time."
5,AWESOME Book! All Parents Need!,"I am a mother of 4 children, all under the age of 7. Baby Hearts has information that I am able to reflect towards each of my children. This whole book has insightful, encourageing, informative information that helps parents look into our childrens windows. My favorite chapter is Expressing Emotions Effectively, as this is what the 2 year olds are in need of. Thanks Dr. Moms for another GREAT book."
5,Great book -- Suitable for parents with kids of all ages,"I really enjoy reading the Baby Hearts book, especially the stories about babies and toddlers expressing their emotions with signs. This book is very informative and offers lots of tips for parents in an easy-to-read manner. The chapters are well-divided and the quick reference guide at the end of the book also comes in very handy."
1,Simplistic~!,"I'm avid reader. If you are a parent and focus into new material for handling your an experience with a child, look something else. This book, offer little insight about handling situation, and all the time you need to read a story with differnt character to have a little advise. Also for a respectful and easy to understand parent this book it's overrated."
5,Excellent Book-Excellent Resource!,"The whole book is full of informative, helpful information that I appreciate as a parent. Chapter 6 on self-esteem and self-confidence really stood out to me. I know I will refer back to the ""Steps Along the Way"" section as my baby grows."
5,"Baby Hearts, Giving your child an emotional head start","Baby Hearts is a very well written book. I am a mother of two, a two year old and a three month old. This book allowed me a glimps into how each of them are devloping emotionally. The book has a wealth of information but DOES not read like a text book. The index and quick referance section allows the reader to find information in a hurry."
2,fluff and advertisement for their other books,"Skip this...it is full of unhelpful anecdotes and is just a lengthy advertisement for their other book Baby Signs. If your looking for actual how tos, check out Bright From The Start. Both books cite many of the same studies but the latter book is written better."
4,Baby Hearts gets to the heart of the matter,"Baby Hearts, the third in Drs. Acredolo and Goodwyn's collection, takes parents and caregivers to the next level in helping children become the most that they can be from the earliest age. This is a resource that all parents should read even before their child/ren have shown whether or not they are a sunflower or a holly bush or somewhere in between. So many parents are focused on ""helping"" their kids go to the top of their class of peers from the moment they take their first breath ... This series of books redirect parental focus to more important aspects of family development ... Baby Hearts addresses the important foundations of parenting that address the emotional needs of our children, as Baby Minds did for their intellectual growth and Baby Signs did for the combination of both."
4,Enjoyable and practical,"I am not quite finished reading this yet but so far it is my favorite book of this type. This book has good examples of what to do and not to do as well as interesting reading about why kids behave the way they do, various studies, etc."
5,Great for new parents,"Giving your child a strong emotional foundation is so important - expecially for first time parents. This book is a valuable, though not all-inclusive, guide to helping parents achieve the positive attitudes and self-reliance children need in today's world."
5,"If you could only read one Book on Child development, This is it!!!",My daughter is only three months old and already the information I've learned and applied from this book are working wonders. She's just such a happy baby and I believe that this book has made that possible. From the beginning she's been a sweet heart but from what I've read thus far I'm able to keep her smiling and understand what it is she need's from me. Every night I read this aloud to my hubby and we are just amazed how simple but effect the teachings in this book are. You may say that don't have the time to read this book but after reading just a few pages this book will make you want to find time to read it.
5,Baby Hearts: A Guide to Giving Your CHild an Emotional Head Start,"I though that this was a great book for any parent to read. I acutally feel kind of funny typing that because I am acutally not a parent. However from the education that I have recieved I can see how true this book really is. I am encouraged to know that there is a great book out there like this to help guide me in my future parenting. It is a book full of truth, funny facts and quotes, and encouragement."
4,"Strong adhesion, but with a strong smell too","This tape works very well in terms of both its holding power and its ability to adhere to irregular surfaces. I am using this material to hold up some woven fabric insulation as well as mount some plastic laminate to the underside of a workbench in the garage. It has only been two weeks, but there is no sign of separation or sag in either job. I am pleased overall with the product but I should warn you this tape has a very strong smell, very noticable even in a larger enclosed space. It isn't a particularly bad smell, just very noticable - almost as if they added fragrance to the tape in an attempt to mask a more typical adhesive smell. Hopefully it will fade over more time, but it is enough of an issue that I would not use any quantity of this tape in a living area."
2,Not permanent,I felt that if this was outdoor it would be extra strong for indoor application. WRONG. I used this to install some touch battery operated lights. Two have fallen already.
3,Not Permanent Outdoors,"I put 2 long strips on a resin house address sign. Stuck it to the side of my house (painted surface). Fell down after a month. Maybe this is good for some applications, but not all that are claimed."
4,Works well,"This is useful for both in/outdoor. It is not paper-based, so it does not fall apart when it gets old. The backing liner is a bit difficult to peel. (It would have been nice if the liner had a split in the middle to make peeling easier)."
4,"Seth Green, and some bugs","This is a great movie for any die hard Seth Green fan, done back in 1993. Seth plays a leading role as an inner city shy boy (with that cute shaggy red hair)who gets premonitions of evil when a nearby marijuana farm's drug induced bugs attack his camp. Despite it's cheesy nature this movie will give you the spooks."
3,"Not scary, and bad effects","This isn't a good horror movie, but if you like B-movies this is decent. Bad effects, but they are good for a laugh. Best thing is seeing Ami Dolenz and Seth Green trying to be interested. Plus at the end what happens to Alfonso Ribiero is worth a watch."
3,It was violent and silly and a good monster romp,"The special effects weren't that great, but its a B-movie and fun. Silly and borderline scary, and just a fun movie to watch when you're bored and nothing else is on tv."
4,everybody thinks im a whoose because this movie scared me!,"i really liked this movie.and my worst fear is bugs so this one scared the hell outta me.and this movie is packed with gore and violence.gross,but cool.like when the doctor steps on the tick and all it's guts come gushing out and then they take out it's insides...up close! the camera is so close to the tick.i wanted to throw up.and im a real fan of Seth Green so this is my movie!some good scares too.I'll warn you,DONT EAT WHILE WATCHING THIS MOVIE! unless you want to throw up.i almost did.after i watched this movie,i was freaked out.now im afraid to step on the floor or go outside,afraid that some giant ticks will eat me! and get inside my skin and eat my insides like in the movie.if you like gore and violence,see this movie.i dont think there could be any other movie grosser than this.it's grosser than friday the 13th! i thought that was the grossest movie i'd ever saw but not anymore.and it had Ami Dolenz and im a big fan of her,too"
1,not what u thought,this was not a disney movie. i was disappointed and gave it away almost as soon as it came in....it took forever to come in.
4,My Son Loves it,"I checked this CD out at my local library, My son and I liked it so much we got a copy for ourselves and bought one as a birthday gift. What I like about this CD is the music is cool. Emy has a funny sense of humor and a great voice. I would recommend this CD to anyone who wants a funky kids CD."
2,Console Port,"Have bought every installment of High Heat, and have loved it. This version is simply terrible. If I wanted a console port, I would not buy a pc version. The lack of mouse support made the totally unintuitive menues even more difficult. Two out of the 3 games I played crashed and one was the only fun game, that was in extra innings. The player graphics look like arcade models and really do not look realistic. Some of the player animations are entertaining.For some reason, the game would not take the pitching imputs from my sidewinder, often requiring more than five attempts (yes my sidewinder was calibrated and works fine with other games). This interrupt the game play and is very frustrating. This has happened in past HH versions, but seems worse in this one.I felt angry and insulted that I was given a console game in the guise of a pc game. I am sad that they have ruined an outstanding franchise, again."
1,One pitch? Simulation? Manage Only? BOO!,The game is gorgeous BUT.....1) No Manage Only. I love to do other things while playing manage only. If I wanted a arcade game I would buy this for my PS2.2) No One Pitch? Another depressing part of the game. Getting 3 or four games in while doing bills was great.The end result: I will not play this game because it is not the simulation and recreation I had hoped for. C'mon 3DO help us stats and manage only types out!!
1,Don't buy it.,"Yeah, High Heat Baseball used to be good. And if you are like me, you might be thinking that it's worth bying, despite the bad reviews. It's not. Don't buy it. The reviews are bad for a reason. The game plays like PS2 game, with no mouse support. The user interface is totally confusing. It's just a console game for the PC, which takes away the things I liked most about the old versions. Don't buy this."
3,So So,"I loved HH 2003. I played it for hours. I wanted new rosters, so I purchased HH 2004. Immediately, the gameplay felt awkward. I tried playing a few more games, but the entire game seemed so awkward compared to HH 2003. I guess the graphics look a little better in 2004, for example there seems to be more transparency etc... If you like HH baseball, and you don't care about the rosters, keep using HH 2003."
2,"One step forward, about 6 steps backwards","I love the High Heat series. Every March I get the new version, excited to try the new features. To sum it up, Graphics are much better, sound is great, budget looks good. BUT many cons, playability is deplorable. This game doesnt recognize the mouse, there is no manage only mode, no one pitch mode, no online play, no hh2003 convertor, no stat spreadsheat. I played for three innings, and my team was 11 for 16. To arcade like even though I tuned it to be more geared for simulation. The menus are sloppy, and very difficult with no mouse support.Maybe MVP Baseball will be decent. This will be the last time I buy a HH game unless significant improvements are made. Every single aspect of the older versions that I loved is completely gone.All they had to do to keep me happy was use last years version, fix the bugs, the financial aspect would be great, maybe improve the graphics. (alhough I didnt mind them) ButStay away from this game"
4,"fun, but not their best.","I first got to know DLG w/ Gotcha, and then I decidded to buy this cd, knowing that it would have had to be teh bomba since Gotcha was really good. I was a little disappointed in this cd, but there are some great songs on here. Ya, the first one and others are worth it! Add this cd to your collection, but if you buy anythign from them, make sure it is Gotcha first!"
5,This album is da Bomb!!!,"This album was Hot!!! the song ""La Quiero a Morir"" and ""Juliana"" are it. They show much skill and I like the whole salsa reggae thang. I love DLG for life!!!!!!!! Boricuas #1"
3,Temperature control is difficult,I love the cooking surface. It is generous and wonderful to use. The vented glass lid makes it convenient to monitor cooking. The only problem is the temperature control. It sems to be warm/simmer or full-bore hot. I have been able to work with that but it means watching carefully all the time.Mrs. Photo Mike
3,LOOKS GREAT,"Cuisinart skillet works very well, but it is too large, and takes up too much room on counter. In some instances for large items, it is excellent but for everyday food items, it is too big, it would be excellent if skillet were 3/4 of its size."
1,Do not waste your money!,"I had high hopes for this set since it said on the front of the box that all the cartoons had restored color and sound. While that may be true for the color and sound which I did not notice, the video quality was as if it had been copied from old VHS video tape. Really bad!. I compared it to my Harvey cartoon box set and the difference was glaring. Do not buy unless you just need to entertain some 5 year olds."
4,EXCELLENT collection for the money,"The ONLY way to see any Max Fleisher cartoons, many of which haven't been seen since the old Betty Boop Republic Laserdiscs some 15 years ago. Ignore the previous review, from someone who apparently has his own agenda.Until these cartoons get the fully restored, Jerry Beck approved treatment, this is the ONLY way to see them. Sing Along With Popeye ALONE is worth the price for it's rareness..."
4,"Good value, great style...","As a casual/dress watch, the slim profile of the man's watch can't be beat. The case and watch face are classic and stylish. The black leather band could be improved upon. It's stiff and a bit thin. Still a great value, that gets much compliments from both men and women! Glad I bought it to add to my collection."
5,Beautiful watch,Nothing less than I expected. The same quality and attractiveness I have come to expect from Skagen. I have many Skagen watches and love their simplicity and beauty.
4,Recommended,"Good watch, face looked / felt small at first, love how thin it is, great value, I would definately buy one again"
5,Sexy... sleek... and a watch,"this watch is a classy, sleek, beautiful alternative to over priced luxury watches. it goes well with casual and formal outfits. i love this watch."
2,Black stain on dress shirt,"I was pleased with this product for the first few months. Then the band decided to start blackening my dress shirt cuffs (on the inside). I sent an email to skagen customer service asking if there was a nonblackening wristband that I could replace the original with. They said the band was designed for this watch and there was no other. OK, I sent a reply asking if this was normal or maybe just an unusual occurrence that might be corrected with a replacement band. They did not reply and I did not receive any 'no reply' email, nor was the address marked as no reply. So I assume they received that email and did not reply. The watch is clearly a dress watch and I do not wear short sleeve shirts so it's useless to me now. Will go to goodwill so I give it two stars for the next owner."
5,wow,"i first saw this band when they played my local pub/club, i went because i wanted to hang out with my friends! from that night i got hooked on them! they were amazing i then saw them a few weeks later at a local record shop anyhoo i first brought cultura which is also a totally amaing album! and when i saw them at the end of '04 they had this album onsale which i just had to buy! its a totally amazing album! everyone should own it! Pauls vocals are amazing! he is just brilliant! i think the best song on this album is Eyes That See! i love pauls voice in it! all of the songs are amazing! Shadows is another brill one! EVERYONE GO BUY THIS ALBUM! roll on summer festivals! i cant wait to see them again!"
5,My own little Breed,"Breed 77 have come a long way for a band from a 3 square mile city , their albums are amazingly good and very catcy especially their newest single , 'the river' . The songs like 'La ultima hora' and 'the river' wich made them get recognition are somewhat mainstream unlike their first album but still very good. The first album was incredible and the second album definately lives up to that standard too.If you dont now who these people are ... Check em out !!!"
3,"an excellent book, but overpriced","I use the original English version in my ESL class.The book can be applied for many purposes, including color names and verb conjugations. I even made a musical setting of this book for a program for the parents.However, the offer here is overpriced. The book consists of 7 illustrations with captions, reading ""I see red,"" ""I see blue,"" and so forth.If you have a printer, you might do almost as well by making a Google search."
5,impressive. definitely worth it,"Enough said...the author is straight forward, frank and detail oriented.Fantastic book for the serious e-businessman/e-businesswoman."
2,WARNING! Do not buy the widescreen edition!!,"I just watched part II of the trilogy, and all they did to make it ""widescreen"" is CUT the top and bottom off of the fullscreen version! Why in the world did they do that? They are supposed to ADD more to the movie with widescreen, not take it out. From what I understand, part III is the same way."
5,Glad to own one of these + digital copies,"When I bought this trilogy, I was concerned about digital copy discs not working with the code provided. I read bunch of reviews from people who complained about the digital disc codes not working.Fortunately, all 3 codes worked for me. The Blu-Ray quality is awesome. Watching this legendary movie on a big screen in Blu-Ray format is great experience. Glad I bought this and buying it at discounted rate was like icing on the cake."
4,straight,"I received the trilogy on time. Fast service.. love that...although ..the case was not in good shape. The middle section keeps falling out. In addition the first disk skips in the beginning. Other than that,loved it."
5,Great!,These are great movies and I loved the BLu-ray Editions! This collection has awesome special features and will last my family a longtime!!
5,Can. Not. Wait.,"As a child born in the '70's and growing up in the '80's, these movies meant a lot to me. I have so many childhood memories of playing with my nextdoor neighbors running around yelling ""1.21 Jigawatts!!!""I haven't been this excited since the movies were first released to DVD. Multiple viewings have not taken anything away from the whole trilogy experience.I am proud to be able to own these movies in a high-def format to continue sharing them with my own children and eventually....my grandchildren.Long live Back to the Future!"
4,"Good, but may not work completely in a DVD drive on a PC","I loved these movies when they came out and had seen one and three many times but had only seen the second one in the theater the initial time.The packaging is good and the styling of all three discs and menus are identical.I'm not much of an audiophile, but the 5.1 sound seemed to work fairly well.I have two gripes about this product:- The film is grainy and the details are poor. You can't really fault them for that since you can't get better than the original film quality.- The Back to The Future II disc does not work on my Vista Home Premium PC. I get audio but no video. This is consistent in Media Center and Windows Media Player. However, this was just a minor inconvenience as the disc worked fine on my Xbox 360. Perhaps Back to the Future 2 uses a CODEC that hasn't been invented yet.Good product, but don't count on all of it working on a PC."
4,Love the box set,I remember going to the theater to see all 3 of these when I was a kid. We recently took our kids to Universal Studios Orlando where we met the Doc Brown character and my kids didn't know who he was! I couldn't believe it! So as soon as we came home I ordered the trilogy which we then watched over the next 3 weeks for family movie night. Now these movies hold a special place in my kids hearts too. Thank you for that.
4,Back to the goodness,"Okay that was cheesy, but this movie was everything I remembered and better. I love these movies I'm so glad I finally have these again. Good purchase on my behalf. 10 ponts for me."
5,GOT TO WATCH!!!!!,I ordered this for my fiancée bday he absolutely LOVED it!!!! He's a huge back to the future fan!! And this trilogy has extra features and bonus seems and it comes in Bly ray!!!!! Picture perfect!!!!! LOVE IT!!!!!!!
2,Widescreen transfer has errors to it!,"P>Universal has acknowledged that disks 2 & 3 of the WIDESCREEN ONLY version of the BTTF movie has problems. The problem is that many of the frames have been transferred incorrectly, causing cut-off's in frames where there shouldn't be. This makes the film look very ugly. Universal has said that they are going to repress disks 2 & 3 and this will become part of the new boxed sets in February of '03.If you have already purchased this item, you can return the disks to UniversalOnce the new disks 2 & 3 are repressed, they will send them to you in the mail.P>Hope this helps. I'm very disappointed..."
2,No way. Time to import the UK one.,"If you have a BluRay player capable of playing UK BluRays then be sure to get their collectors edition. It comes with WAY more than this. Including a license plate, Delorean bluprints, the sports almanac, and so much more. This version is a completely stripped compared. It doesn't even come out to being that much more."
3,"Good movies, bad packaging","The movies are as great as they've ever been and look stunning in high-definition. However, the case leaves a lot to be desired. If you have to include a sheet of instructions on how to get the discs in and out or the package, you've made some seriously bad design decisions along the way."
2,Good but not great,"The videos were ok but when I went to load the digital copy I found that Universal want's to collect all sorts of personal data such as gender, birth date, ect. This is wrong. You sell an item and the customer should get the item with out having to go some where else and produce personal info. Boo to Universal....."
4,Must Have for BTTF Fans,"This three disc set is jsut chock-full of extras!!! This is a must have for any BTTF fan and it's interesting to see and hear lots of information that wasn't known prior.The junky matte of II & III though means that if you haven't already gotten your copies, you should wait til February so that you can get the correct matting."
4,Commentary is not by Fox and Zemeckis...,Sorry to disappoint but I've got the final discs right here and there are interviews with Fox and Zemeckis but the scene-by-scene commentaries are by producers Bob Gale and Neil Canton. Still a great set but not all I was hoping.
4,MJF fans get this!!,"THis was the movie series of my generation. I cannot belive that it has been 18 years since I sat in a theater in Columbia, TN and laughed my butt off! The subseqnt fils were just a funny, but I saw each from a different perspective and found different but similar things in II and III. Definetly a MUST have in the DVD collection.Now if me can get The Day After and Threads on DVD we would be kickin it plutonium style!"
5,BTTF on DVD at last,"I have been a fan of the BTTF trilogy for many years, I have had the video version for a while. When they anounced that the trilogy was to come out on DVD I was really excited. In Australia the DVD's were released 21 August (wide screen only), I bought it sraight away. One thing that I did notice, and this is a big one, the wide screen is achieved by cutting the top and bottom off the full screen video version. Apart from that the DVD release is really terrific, loads of extras, perfect video transfer and DTS soundtrack to blow your mind."
2,Back to the Future Trilogy: Fullscreen Edition,"I haven't received the item yet so I can't give my review on it. But, I am very displeased that it has been 13 days since I bought it and i still don't have it. It was suppose to arrive by the 26th, but it is the 31st and still not here. Hopefully i can change this review because I don't want to be critical."
5,GOOD DEAL GRAB IT WHILE YOU CAN!,"All three movies for that cheap and quality was good, awsome 80s triolgy, must have for dvd collectors like me."
3,back to the future trilogy,"My sons and husband liked all of them very much. I did not like the first one as much because the main characters kept taking the name of the Lord in vain. Jesus is not a curse word, and He is my Lord and Savior. How would someone like it if people called out your father's name every time something went wrong! I wish I had a television that blocked all the bad language, but since this was a set of movies made a long time ago I was shocked at the bad language! I would have liked to know about the bad language so I could prepare for it."
2,eighties rating system bad,Loved these movies when I was young but now feel there is just way too much cussing for younger audiences. Needs a higher rating.
1,Help me try and balance.,"These movies actually deserve one more star than i've given them, but it seems that every single person reviewing it follows it in some cult-like fashion. Doesn't anyone else realize Michael J. Fox is a terrible actor? He looks like a little tweaker always wiggin' out and going crazy and Christopher Lloyd has got to be one of Hollywood's biggest inside jokes. They released him in movies like these and ""Angels in the Outfield"" just to see how many morons went to go see these movies with such a terrible fool acting in them. Good job everyone, giving BACK TO THE FUTURE... 5 stars. This movie's a joke, as is anyone who's actually bought it and/or spent the time to watch it."
3,Back To the Future Package!,"I wanted the Blu-ray version. Got it! The only problem is the packaging. The double discs fall out of the case when opened, and will not stay intact. Be sure to handle with care or they could get scratched. The cheap package flip over [on top of the other] increases the chances of disc damage. Otherwise great!"
4,You can be in a coma and still enjoy this.,"I'm not usually a person that likes this kind of movie(s), but i have to admit that they are great fun even though some of the facts couldn't really happen even if this stuff could be true. How can anyone not like Michael J. Fox. He is the appitimiy of humorious fun and basically a good actor and actually has a very nice stage bio besides.You can be in a coma, or even be brain dead and still enjoy this weird collection of DVDs. If anything they are worth hearing in 5.1 Stereo Sound and seeing in the proper screen format. So i have to admit even an old foogy like me can really get off on this set of entertaining films. It's good clean fun for the whole entire family."
5,Favorite Trilogy of all time,To say I'm a Back To The Future geek would be a understatement. I LOVE these movies. I know everything about it. I love the commentary in this because it explains so much. Mainly why McFly (Crispin Glover) wasn't in the remaining sequels.
5,Finally found it!,Fire up your flux-capacitors and hold on here comes 88 mph of fun ! My daughter saw this on tv and I couldn't resist educating her on why my child hood dreams of a delorean and a hover board were so much fun she loves it despite the fact that I still want a hover board this blast from the past rules!
5,Great update to a classic franchise.,I have owned this series on VHS in the past and had liked it then but when I saw that it had been remastered and brought to blu ray I was more than ready for the upgrade. The picture and sound are great! There is more than enough special features to please anyone. I give this a two thumbs up for Universal.
3,"Great Movies, Poor Product","I've waited a long time to get my hands on this trilogy. They take me back to the 80's, back to my teen years. With that excitement aside, I'm now told that there is an error with disk 2 & 3. It seems the widescreen matting was not done correctly resulting in a poor product by Universal. This is Universals response to the situation.....""Thank you for your email. Universal Studios will exchange Back to the Future parts 2 and 3 for copies with the updated framing in late February 2003. You may send the DVDs back now or wait until February. Please send Back to the Future disks 2 and 3, without the case, and a letter with the following information: Name, Full Mailing Address, Daytime Phone Number, Reason for Return and Return Address. Send to:Back to the Future DVD ReturnsPO Box 224468Dallas, Texas 75260Thank you,Universal Studios Customer Service"""
1,"Horrible packaging, awesome films.","I've already destroyed my BTTF2 blu-ray disc. I was being gentle when trying to put the disc back in but now the disc is toast. How could they let this kind of case get through QA??? I should've just put them into another case right away. I ticks me off that I can't return this because it's considered ""my fault"". They need to make good and re-release this set in better packaging."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,"Do NOT buy this. The packaging is beyond moronic -- and that's putting it lightly. I had never seen packaging like this before and hope I don't again. Getting the discs out is a major headache and leaves them VERY prone to scratching or even breaking. There is no standard push button -- you need to kinda forcibly push down on them and slide them. Getting them back in is even worse. If you buy this, there's a good chance you're throwing your money down the drain as you'll likely end up with scratched or broken discs sooner or later.The movies, by all accounts, look great. But what's the point if the discs get damaged trying to watch them? They should have packaged them in one standard 6 disc case or three regular 2 disc cases (one per movie + digital copy disc).The UK version does NOT have these packaging problems."
1,This one is on Amazon!,"The heading for the Blu-Ray discs I purchased clearly says 'Blu-Ray + Digital copy"" When I received the discs, there were no activation codes present and in fine print (about 4 point type) on the product sleeve it says that the digital copies MAY NOT be eligible for activation after 10/26/11! Amazon is falsely advertising this product!"
1,The packaging SUCKS!,I absolutely despise the packaging! What moron thought of this? It's totally craptastic. Unfortunately I had to open it to discover how awful it is. Otherwise I would send it back. I guess I'll need to find something else to put the discs in. I'd like to find that guy that invented this and shove the discs right up....well I guess I can't say that here -but you know where I want to shove them! Do not buy this. You will NOT be happy. I'm considering pawning this set off on someone else and getting the UK edition.
5,The Best On DVD!!!,"This is definitly value for money! Its a great price for the three discs and well worth it, not only is it the greatest trilogy to come to DVD they have packed it full of extra goodies well worth a look at! Everything from behind the scenes, to outtakes that are actually funny!!!!! and deleted scenes that dont bore you to death!!!!!The picture quality is excellent. The 5.1 surround sound is absolutly terrific, everything is crystal clear and never sounded better. All packed with great bonus features on each disc. No body has yet to beat this trilogy for presentation and satasfaction when bringing them onto DVD.If you're wondering if it's worth replacing those old VHS's for the DVD's of BTTF, then the anser is a great big definent, ""YES""I garentee you will not be disapointed by the presentation and extras of these 3 great films."
4,Great but not perfect,"This review is for those who are already fans of these movies. This boxed set is great. Full with extras. It has the ZZ-Top movie MTV videos, interviews, making of and much, much more. The only flaw will be the pop-up video feature does not work on every DVD-player. Which means if you have an incompatible DVD player in your house you will miss this. And the outtakes are TERRIBLE!!!. Watching them will only make you want to smash the DVD on the floor. But anywho, if you are a fan and are wondering if you should invest your hard earnd mula on this set the answer is YES. You will not feel sorry."
3,Worst Blu-ray Packaging EVER!!!!,"BEWARE if you purchase this set on Blu-ray.Universal decided to use some strange packaging that rather than use center hubs, uses little plastic clips to hold the edge of the disc in place.This means to remove the disc you kind of have to flex the entire package tray to get the disc out; if you try and grab the disc and pull, you're likely to break off the edge of your disc due to the little clips that extend over the top of the disc surface.I've no idea why Universal went with this horrible package, but if I were you if you order this, save yourself some trouble and add this to your cart as well:10 Empty Deluxe Blu-ray Replacement Cases for Blu-ray Disc Movies #BLURAYN (Blue Ray Blue-Ray Blu Ray)"
1,DO NOT BUY THESE DVDS!,"Consumer beware: every widescreen copy of the Back to the Future trilogy is defective. Parts 2 and 3 have had the top and bottom of the picture CUT OFF! Universal so far has done a pretty clean job of hiding this information, because they haven't made an official consumer alert or announced a recall of any kind, because they still want you to buy it, BUT DON'T GIVE IN! They will fix the problem in february, and will offer replacements to everyone who bought the defective copies. Howevwer, I'm afraid that there will be alot of people duped into buying it and never know that it's defective, unless they have a widescreen TV. So, buyer beware... I will personally put up with the long, painful wait to add these discs to my library. However, I think it's better than buying a defective copy and risk the mail in replacement program getting [...]up."
4,"Great product, but...",It was great seeing the Back to the Future trilogy is magnificent blu-ray picture clarity and sound but Universal spent no money on the packaging or disk graphics. The movies are fantastic and worth buying but....The cheap trifold disk holder crams in 6 disks. I was afraid I was going to break the movie trying to get it out of the holder. No effort went into the disk graphics. The original dvd release of the trilogy at least had full color movie poster graphics on each disk.This is one of my favorite movie trilogies but I was disappointed in it's presentation. Not worthy of a silver anniversary release.
2,An inferior release,"Is there no quality control at Universal? Like many others who bought this box set immediately after it was released, I was very disappointed to find out (after it was released) that there were misframed shots in the widescreen editions of Parts II and III. I've never come across this problem with any other major studio release before, and it's quite disappointing to see a major DVD release such as this one suffering from this problem. Very disappointing - Buyer beware.. wait for the new presses coming out in February, or risk wasting your money."
3,Who Needs Back to the Future 2 and 3?,"I'm glad Back to the Future is finally being released on DVD because it is a great 80's film, but hopefully they will release the films individually as well because the second film is bad and the third film is mediocre. I saw the sequels in the theater when I was a kid and was mostly disappointed. The key ingredient to the first film is Crispin Glover and his bizarre but likable performance, and his absence hurts the sequels greatly because eventually Christopher Lloyd's overacting just gets obnoxious and Michael J. Fox's stupid cuteness just gets ugly. I'd give the first film five stars, but the other two I'd give two stars, which means they don't hold up on their own and are not worth owning. I'm surprised most of the reviewers approve of the three films being released together."
1,Not satisfied.,Ordered new box set got a used one. On top of that I can't get the digital copies waste of money.
2,DEFECTIVE DIGITAL COPIES,"SO FAR I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO ENJOY THIS SET DUE TO ""DIGITAL COPY"" DISCS BEING DEFECTIVE. SENT THE FIRST ONE BACK, NOW THE SECOND ONE IS HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM. SOME DISCS WILL DOWNLOAD AND RUN, WHILE OTHERS WILL NOT. VERY UPSETTING! THE ONLY REDEEMING POINT THAT EARNED THIS REVIEW A 3 STAR WAS THAT THE MOVIES SEEM TO WORK, OR AT LEAST WILL BEGIN TO PLAY, HAVE NOT HAD TIME TO WATCH THEM AT PRESENT. LOVE THE TRILOGY, BUT HATE DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS!!!! ANYONE ELSE RUNNING INTO THIS PROBLEM TOO?UPDATE 1/19/11: MY REPLACEMENT HAS THE SAME PROBLEM AS THE FIRST, DEFECTIVE DIGITAL COPY! CONTACTED UNIVERSAL WITH NO HELP, NOW DEBATING WHAT ELSE WILL BE WRONG WITH THE NEXT ONE ""IF"" I DECIDE TO SHIP IT BACK. WHAT A PAIN!!!!"
4,"fast shipper, condition was a little optimistic from seller, but im overall satified.","Upon opening this purchase i would rate it in Used ""good"" condition, not ""very good"", or even ""like new"", there were obvious signs of wear on the product and fingerprints and a few nick's ect on the disc's themselves, they play fine and im not disapointed with my purchase, 4 stars for a ""optamistic item condition"" but its not bad.As far as the movies themselves im blown away at the transfer and the music on blueray, last time i seen any of these movies was on VHS and this blu-ray is fantastic, well worth purchasing anyone thats a fan of purchasing 80's and 90's movies i can tell you this blueray does not disapoint."
2,Digital Disappointment,"Love these 3 movies, but when you shell out $30+ it'd be better if you didn't get TWO digital copies of Part II and 0 digital copies of Part III. I don't even know how I'll get Part III now that the other 2 have already been downloaded."
5,A five star collection!!!,"This 3 DVD set containing all three Back To The Future movies is a real treat!!! Oodles of special features(Audio commentaries,featurettes,trailers,and more!!!) and great widescreen presentations of the movies!!! A top notch package!!! Great for fans of the series!!!"
5,My 9yr old daughter loved it!!!,"Purchased to share the movie with my 9yr old... She loved loved the movie!!! Quality is great; comes in blue ray and digital copy. So hard to find... But with amazon, easy as 1, 2, 3!!!Wanda"
5,Back To the Future Trilogy Blu-Ray,"This trilogy is great! Awesome to see all three movies in this great quality with the blu-ray disks! The digital copy is also a great addition to the package, you can store these on your computer and take them with you anywhere with almost the same great quality. Very happy with this purchase."
5,Vintage Michael J. Fox,Awesome Movie...So good in fact that my daughter burned out the DVD player by watching this movie over and over and over again (multiplied by 1.21 gigawatts).
4,This movie is GREAT!,"If you like fun and adventure, you will really like this movie! I rated it at four because of the language. Some of it is not good for younger children. But it's great to share with your friends!"
4,Great Movies,"I'll just be brief...I wish I could watch these ones for the first time again!Great movies, but III was a bit of a let down, I didn't enjoy the whole cowboy thing... I & II were absolutely awesome, worth every minute, good stuff."
5,Back To The Future on Blu-ray. Enough said.,"There is NOTHING negative that can be said about this. Tons of bonus features, amazing quality, etc. A true digital masterpiece."
2,Is this a game of OPERATION or a blu ray set?,"My goodness....what a disaster...I've about destroyed my set and still don't have all the blu rays free from their plastic prisons!The first disc, which was freed with loads of help and luck and broken plastic....looks absolutely what blu ray is supposed to look like...spectacular..... and I always like the Universal Blu ray menus.. but good lord the packaging is easily a 5 star deduction from what would be a 5 star plus set based on content....I don't know how to get the attention of Universal other than to put up poor reviews for their edification. And please...before you give me an Unhelpful vote...these reviews are not just for the movies but how they are presented, packaged, and priced and for 50bucks plus we should not be wrestling with and damaging our dvds! thanks!"
4,"BluRay trilogy is great, good bonus features, NO ULTRA-VIOLET CODES","BluRay trilogy is great. Nice quality, especially considering the movie was shot in 85.Good bonus features, so many that I haven't matched them all.Unfortunately, NO ULTRA-VIOLET CODES. I was saddened by this."
5,"""You have to come back with me...Back to the Future!""","How can anyone who likes these movies not like this set. If you are like me and where waiting for these movies to come out on DVD, you would have been pleased to see them come out like this instead of having to buy them all separate. I liked these movies when they came out, and I was so excited to see them finally come out on DVD. I loved how they all connected to each other like a continuing story. They made you want to see the next one as soon as it came out. I had to know what was going to happen to Marty and Doc Brown. Sure, some of the parts were kind of corny, but that added comedy to the movies. SO, if you like these movies, and you are tired of your worn out VHS, buy this product."
3,Blu-rays great packaging horrible,"The blu-rays look great. There are plenty of special features. The only problem I have with the overall set is the packaging. Which when your trying to get the blu-rays out, it feels like your going to break the disc. It even comes with instructions on how to remove the discs properly and still feels like your going to destroy the disc. Other than the disc problem, everything is great it looks fantastic and is full of special features. The blu-rays are a 5 the packaging is a 1."
5,Rating Back to the Future,"First time to buy a ""not new"" video. Selection exactly as described ""Pristine condition"". Arrived sooner than quoted. Very pleased."
2,Disc packaging is virtually impossible to use,"There is no other way to state this. The packaging for this trilogy is virtually impossible to use. I have nearly shattered the Back to the Future part 1 disc twice, and I have only been able to remove it from its packaging twice. I really have no idea if the disc still works since my Blu-ray player refuses to do anything other than display loader error, but this is rediclous. What was the point of designing a new case for blu-ray discs that is just not user friendly?"
4,Back.....to the Future!,"I think we all remember the Back to the Future movies. This set is a must have if you are still stuck in the 80's. Huey Lewis on the soundtrack, and Michael J. Fox on his skateboard make these movies classics."
3,5 Stars for the movie 2 stars for including the other 2,"Don't get me wrong I love Back To The Future, But the first movie is a classic, although I know most of you reviewers will not agree with me, I just wish I didn't have to buy 2 other movies I don't want. In my opinion this is a scheme that Universal is using to make money off of all of it's customers."
4,Nice collection.,"All 3 movies at a very nice price. The only thing that really annoyed me was there weren't more special features to view. There are alot listed, but they are very short. I've also read some things about the widescreen format being wrong. If it is, I sure didn't notice a difference. I have recently watched the VHS version and to me it seems like your getting more picture than the VHS version. I didn't buy this because it was widescreen, I bought it because I really enjoy all 3 of these movies. And is rating it lower gonna effect Universal? Not here at least, but I do think more material should have been added to these DVD's. But if you really liked the movies, I would recommend this to anyone, especially becuase the price is right."
3,Rushed and commercial release,"Have ordered and bought the set in amazon before I had a chance to read the defect on Part 2 and 3. Scanned a few scenes in 2 and 3 but the differences are not very obvious.(since I'm using a 4:3 tv). Whether you buy it today or want to wait for a re-pressing, that is totally up to you.(probably depends on your preference for the movie) But I really felt that the release was very commercial and rushed... why? first time for me to see a drinking water product leaflet together with the dvd booklet.... WOW! talk about earning mega-bucks for endorsements... the plastic cover of the plastic case was also cut, folded.... it appears the assembler was in a big hurry to ship it off and earn hoiday pay.....I hope my part 3 disc works 100% ... I saw a small deppression on the disc....Overall rating of 3 stars...but the disc made it low...(video quality for me is 4 stars- some scenes appear grainy on different parts)"
5,LOVE THESE MOVIES... and got the bluray trilogy at a great price!,"A product review is not necessary for this item. Your not human if you don't love these movies! I bought this set the other day and it did take Amazon a little long to send the item but I guess that's what I get for using the Super Saver Shipping... Anyways, if you have never seen these movies I highly recommend them. I remember seeing them when I was young and have been a fan ever since! I would probably suggest renting them first before you buy it just to see if these movies are in your taste... but your probably going to end up buying the set anyways so what ever!"
1,Qaulity Control Issues / Defective Disc,"I bought this 25th Anniversary Trilogy Blu Ray box set from Amazon. On the box Paramount boasts ""perfect picture"" and ""perfect sound"". My problem is with Paramount Studios. I have written twice to Paramount concerning the 2nd movie freezes completely about 40 minutes into the movie. I have had no such issues with any of my other 100 plus blu rays. I received automated e-mail responses both times I e-mailed but they failed to contact me since then. I am very disappointed with this purchase. I have no complaints about Amazon. They have GREAT customer service!"
1,Dont buy,I bought this product assuming I would get the digital copy. It seems they do not give the authorization code anymore. Don't buy if you are expecting to get the digital copy.
3,DVD's were loose,"2 of the 3 Dvd's were loose in its package, and one was scratched.Came one time and was happy about that."
4,Disc 2 & 3 Framing Error Update,"""Please call 888-703-0010 for detailed instructions on how to receive your Back to the Future DVD replacement.""They will mail you a pre-paid envelope to return your discs in."
2,Beware of framing issues on this set,"A great set for your collection, but be aware that disc 2 and 3 have framing issues that chops off some picture.Check the issues on the dvdreview.com site for details.Go to the news section and do a search for this set.See sample at www.dvdreview.com/news/pokenews.asp?news_id=5666"
4,GREAT TRILOGY NEW DVD'S HAVE FIXED PROBLEM,"I bought this trilogy a year ago and I have not noticed any problem with the widescreen edition like others have. They must have corrected it by now. OK now about the films: This trilogy is well worth the bargain price. The first film is the best by far, but the sequels are amusing and bring the story to an end. Lots of extras and a very good DVD transfer make this set a steal!"
3,"Great movie, great extras...","... However, the poor framing is absolutely unforgiveable. The studio knew about it but released it anyway, and now it is up to us, the unsuspecting consumer to get a replacement in February! Despite how minor this may sound, it is a very major problem. It honestly looks like someone down at Universal who was trying to cut corners simply took the 4:3 pan and scan version and slapped black bars on the top and bottom, thinking none of us would ever know the difference. Substantial portions of the picture are often cut off, parts that I can remember vivdly from watching the movies as a kid that are no longer there. For example, in part 2 when Marty gets out of the lake and his jacket starts beeping at him, you have no idea what is going on becuase the blinking button on the coat is completely out of frame. My advice is to wait until March if you're going to buy this set..."
2,Blu Ray Pauses and Freezes,"The movie speaks for itself but I had problems with the blu ray disc for the 1st movie. About 15 minutes into the movie it began pausing, skipping and then just froze up completely. I tried it on a friends blu ray player and the same problems occurred. I've requested a replacement and once I receive it, I will update this review.UPDATE : March 17, 2002 - I forgot to post an update but Amazon mailed me a new copy without any problems or questions. The new copy works perfectly so it must have been that I received a bad disc the first time."
5,This movie ROCKS!,"If you like comedy, adventure, and a little bit of make belive; you will love this item. Michael J. Fox is great! If you haven't seen this, you have to and as soon as possible. These movies are GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Why post old reviews for the DVD on the Bluray Trilogy?,"The ONE star is for the OLD REVIEWS not the movies. Listen up people:This is THE BLURAY TRILOGY - NOT THE DVD TRILOGY!Amazon, do your job properly and take OUT the stupid older reviews for THE DVD TRILOGY. It's in THE BLURAY SECTION and we don't care about the DVD reviews from 2002 or 1962..."
3,So far so good.,"Well, this is just for my young age memory. If you are less then 30, you might keep away from them."
3,For sale separately?,"The first Back to the Future is a classic 80s movie. One of my alltime favorites. Unfortunatley, the two sequels aren't anywhere near as good. I don't want to blow forty bucks to get just the first one on DVD. Sell them separately for crying out loud. This is just a marketing scheme to force everyone to buy all three."
2,Back to the Future-Trilogy,"I have read all the complaints about disc two and three. I already knew that there were going to be complaints about this set before I bought it. I only bought this set for Back to the Future Part 1. The other two parts were matted versions and not true widescreen versions. I already own the Fullscreen Laserdisc versions of Part 2 & 3. The dvd versions are poorly matted with too much space above the actors heads and too much information cut off the bottom. I always try to buy fullscreen versions of movies that were filmed on Super 35( Terminator 2, The Abyss). My biggest complaint of this dvd set is that all the documentaries switch back and forth between widescreen and fullscreen. This is only a problem if you have a 16:9 tv but soon everyone will have this type of tv and Universal should have know better. Also the add on sticker that says Widescreen or Fullscreen is deceptive."
3,Quality control...,"Attention, aficionados with OCD: Whoever did the hi-def transfer of Part 1 forgot to turn off the anamorphic compression on the end credits. Titles are ""squished"" as a result. Not cool."
4,The packaging really isn't that bad,"There have been a lot of complaints about removing the disks from this package, but it really isn't all that bad once you get the hang of it. It's only really annoying when you have to dig out the digital copy disks when you transfer them to your computer, and that is something you'll only have to do once. The movie disks themselves are really not that bad to remove repeatedly.As for the movies, the Blu-Ray versions of the movies look gorgeous, and the extra features are great resource for BTTF fans. The glimpses of the Eric Stoltz footage is a fun addition, and there is a hilarious outtake for the first movie that really makes this new set worth it.My only real complaint is that the image quality on the iTunes digital copies could be better. Even though the resolution is 853x460 the picture looks pretty soft if you watch it on anything larger than an iPhone screen."
4,"Eric Stoltz, we hardly knew thee.","I'm happy to see these great films are finally coming to DVD, it's just too bad that there doesn't seem to be any footage included of Eric Stoltz's performance as Marty McFly. (One of) the reason(s) that this has been delayed for so long is that Universal was having trouble coming to an agreement with Stoltz regarding the possible usage of footage he appeared in before it was decided he didn't act enough like a teenager and Fox was cast in his place. Apparently, there was no deal. I'll buy the dvd set anyway.-Mike"
2,Love the trilogy but why do I have to go through 10 minutes of crap before I can watch the movies?,"This is not a review of the trilogy. I am sure most people who are thinking of getting this set have already watched the movies. If not, there are plenty of reviews out there. I am just disappointed that why do I have to watch 10 minutes of crap every time I want to watch any of the movie? That is so annoying. I paid and bought this blu ray set. I should not be forced to watch 3-5 rubbish trailers/videos before I can watch the movie."
5,The Set,How could you go wrong with the back to the future trilogy. A good time to watch on a nice rainy day. good buy
5,Pretty Much as Expected.,"The product comes with 6 disks. 3 of the disks are blu-ray, and the other 3 are digital install copies which didn't play for me in high def blu ray definition. In blu ray, high def is great for really analyzing all the detail and work that the producers put into making the backgrounds and scenes and you can even see their makeup.The packaging is standard what you would get if you were to purchase it from costco or bestbuy or something.It's weird how the disks are held in by the case's plastic. It's fairly brittle, and I already broke one of the little pieces off, so you must be a tad gentle. Everything plays very well. It doesn't come with its own built-in blu-ray player codec thing so you'll need to have one installed already or download one. I used the free trial from cyberlink, and it works really well."
1,Back to the Future Widescreen Problem,"Buyer Beware: I bought the widescreen version of the trilogy when it came out. The BTTF 2 and 3 discs both have problems w/ being misframed. After returning it for another set I encountered the same problem. I called the store I purchased it from and they were not aware of any problems. Then I contacted Universal and was told that there is a problem w/ the widescreen version and a corrected version of the disc will be released sometime in February. If I wanted a corrected copy I would have to pay the shipping and handling for the discs because they screwed up. Great company backing their product. They said that the problem is w/ all widescreen discs not full frame. Beware of this problem, seems Universal wants all the money now for Christmas then they will admit to this problem after everyone has bought a defective product."
3,No digital copy but Blu-ray looks good,Disappointed that the activation code for the digital copies no longer included or available. Still a good price for the trilogy. Great surround sound demo disc.
5,Back to the future 25th Anniversary Trilogy + digital copy,"Great movie, I like it, my six year old son also like it a lot, he watched three times and great buy. Recommended."
1,UNIVERSAL HAS RIPPED US OFF AGAIN,"You have probably already read about the aspect ratio problems with this set. Universal announced, in a statement (go to dvdangle.com to read the entire message) that they will NOT be releasing a corrected version, because the flaws are minimal and cannot be detected by the customer. Really? Well then how did I, and many like me, notice that the aspect ratio on parts 2 and 3 are incorrect? First, the ""E.T."" fiasco, now this. What a gyp..."
1,Buyer Beware!,"""Disappointment"" doesn't do justice to this long-anticipated release. What it really is is an insult. Parts 2 and 3 are incorrectly framed, the French language track is out of synch, and there are subtitle occlusion problems with a number of players. It doesn't take long to fix these problems, yet Universal is making buyers wait until LATE FEBRUARY, three months after the release, to offer replacements, which you will have to ship to Universal at your own expense. DO NOT BUY this or any Universal DVD."
5,A classic,"Back to the Future is a classic movie trilogy that everyone must have or see! A funny movie for all ages. Great acting, great director and even the efects are OK if you think about the technology available in the time that is was made.I really enjoy this movies and I am never tired of watching them."
5,Some of my all-time favorite movies (and I'm a GIRL!),"Not only are these movies classics, but the set has a ton of interesting extras -- full of trivia. There are hours and hours to listen to."
5,great movie and awesome experience with kids,"I have two children the ages of 10 and 7. They have never seen the back to the future movies and I told them it was worth watching. We fired up the player and watched the first one. They loved it and just asked to watch the second and third movie. The loved the series and it was a great experience to share with them.The movie itself is gorgeous on BluRay. I am not one to really look at all the extras, but did peek into a couple.A must watch or buy if you were the generations of the 80s. Still very entertaining"
4,Good product - But the disc holder is horrible,Got an awesome lightning deal during Thanksgiving (24 bucks for the set).... The picture quality is excellent. The only issue is the disc holder - they have devised a new way to attach the disc. Not sure what was wrong with the usual casing...Good buy though. I recommend it.
5,Love it.,I love these movies. watched them growing up and had to have them in blu raygreat movies. great sound and picture quality
5,Back to the Classic!,"Michael J Fox leads us on a journey that can only be described as the pinnacle of science fiction humor. With a script oozing with originality and ball bouncingly hillarious razor sharp wit, Back to the Future will not only challenge your mental capacity for logical thought, but will also condem you to hours of laughing your lips off. This DVD trilogy comes complete with behind the scenes snippets and the secrets behind those hover board special effects. This set is a must have for any science fiction enthusiast whom enjoys the simple pleasures of bending your mind in to a pretzel."
4,UK boxset is better,"I just want to give a little advice to all the customers. Don't get this boxset, go for the UK version of the Trilogy set. The price is almost the same, but you get more for your money: An extra DVD containing the bonus material, a nicer packaging and the wonderful DTS 5.1 sound.I've read some UK reviews and they say the widescreen format of BTTF 2 is correct so... what are you waiting for? If you have a multiregion DVD player this is your best option.By the way, amazing movies!!!"
2,I was disapointed,We were so excited to recieve our movies only to be let down by the second and third dvd's. Both the second and third movies had scratches and skipped. I have recieved scratched disks before but none that had the type that cause skipping. Not very happy.
5,Back to Blu Ray,"Wow, just, wow. These films are classics for all time, and Universal did them right by giving them a fantastic Blu Ray Transfer. The colors are crisp, the darks are dark, and the detail is superb. This Blu Ray disc set not only has a fantastic transfer and audio quality, but the Special Features are fantastic. Basically what you get are most of the features that were all ready available, plus some new HD documentaries and featurettes.The movies themselves are fantastically creative, and are amongst some of the best Sci-Fi films made in the last 40 years. The story revolves around a crazy scientist named Doc Brown who creates a Time Machine, and accidentally sends his partner, Marty McFly back in time to the 1950's, where he accidentally stops his parents from ever falling in love. This premise is original, hilarious, and tense, and the movies, all 3, feel like crazy roller coaster rides. Definitely recommended."
2,Horrible case!,"OMG, I didn't believe the other reviews that mentioned how ridiculous this case is. I figured it can't possibly be that bad. Well guess what, I pulled and pried and yanked every which way and the darn discs absolutely would not come off, even pulling at full strength! Short of completely ripping the case apart and smashing the plastic, there seemed no way to get the discs out! Let's just say there is a reason there are tons of Youtube videos instructing how to remove the discs from this absurd case. Even after watching them, it was still difficult to get it out, and once I did, I had the hardest time figuring out how to push the discs back into place! You certainly will never want a visitor or friend trying to watch this to remove the discs themselves as they will likely ruin the case and the discs trying to get them out. I am so flabbergasted at the poor design that I can't even bother commenting on the movies themselves."
5,Awesome Set,this set contains three of michael j. foxx's & Christopher Lloyd's greates movies they made. the three back to the future movies are entertaining beyond anything. they all are great movies. they all are must sees.
5,back to the future,honestly this trilogy is my favorite of all time....i honestly can say back to the future trilogy is my #1 movies!
3,They Childproofed my BttF Case!,this is a review for the Blu-Ray 25th anniversary set that came out 10/26/10. Getting the Discs in and out of the packaging is a nightmare and I'm always worried I'm going to snap the disc or scratch them. I've taken them out of the case and put them in proper sleeves. They're worse than the clamshell packaging that some products are sold in where you have to practically sever a limb during the arduous process to get it open.
3,No package deals--give me the original!,"I love Back to the Future, but I'm only lukewarm to the second and third films and don't really have to have them on DVD. The first I want, because it stands alone just fine. Yet Universal in its wisdom (yes, that's sarcasm) has decided we must have the boxed set and only the boxed set?I was insulted enough by that alone, but to discover from other reviews that the two discs I don't want are flawed adds injury to the insult. Let me get this straight: I'm expected to shell out an extra [amount]for two movies I don't necessarily want just to get the one I want more, and for my trouble I'll get lousy copies of those movies?Universal, we deserve better. It was boneheaded not to release the movies as standalones as well as in the boxed set. Even if standalones are coming down the road, those who enjoyed the first movie more (I'm hardly alone in my opinion) deserved the chance to own it separately if they wished."
1,Audio Track Malfunction on ALL Discs!,"I've read everyone else complaining about the format but I didn't even get to make it that far! The moment I hit play on the first disc I knew something was wrong when I could hear half of the sound effects as Marty walks in go the Doc's house. As the film went on my suspicions were confirmed as Marty answered the phone and I couldn't hear anything but the background music when he's supposed to be saying ""I'm late for school!""Tried the second disc out of curiosity and low and behold the exact same problem. Didn't even bother trying the last movie.I love these movies and was disappointed that I'll have to go through the return process and await another release with high hopes yet again."
1,"Cropped widescreen, I, II & II","I was very,very mad to find our all three films Back to the future I, II, and III are all cropped down from a full screen version. This means the movie you see is a little more than a third of what you saw in the original theatrical release. These movies are one of my most favorites and it is very dissappointing to think that Universal can do this to ruin a classic. Even though there is no pan and scan in the first film it is also cropped. I compared it to the full screen version and you will see the difference. Check it for yourself. Besides this BIG problem these DVDs are awesome."
3,Code non valid for Peru,The code for the digital copy is not valid for my country. I cant used. im dissapointed with that. You gotta have mor carefull with this problem. Blueray disc ok.
5,The BEST time-traveling movies in the history of movies!,"These three movies, especially the first one, are some of my favorite movies out of all time. I have loved these movies ever since I was old enough to understand them. I recommend these movies to anybody. These movies deserve to be treasured for as long as people hold onto them. They are definite masterpieces. The only thing I can say about them: I LOVE THEM!!!"
5,Amazing Presentation of an Outstanding Trilogy,"I owned the 2002 trilogy release on DVD and have to say that the Blu-ray release is far superior. The extras are amazing and the picture and sound are extraordinary. The digital copies are not really needed, but are a good extra."
5,Step by step blu ray disc removal process,"Ok, I got this thing figured out ;-)There are two sets of clips for each blu ray -- a bottom set that moves, and then a right and left fixed set.It's actually very easy -- here we go.1. Pull the disc downwards by inserting your index finger in the center hole of the disc.2. Beneath each disc is a set of plastic retaining clips -- you will see the clips give a bit as you're pulling the disc down3. After activating the clips, you can now gently lift the disc out.4. To return the disc back to its holder, simply place the disc back by tucking it under the right fixed clip, pull down on the disc to activate the bottom clips, then you can gently pop the left side of the disc under the left fixed clip.Try this a few times, and let me know how it goes. Hope you found this helpful. My discs remained scratch free.Best...trilogy...ever"
5,Excellent and entertaining.,"I have always liked this series. Now that I have the set and have watched all straight through all I can say is, WOW! This is a great and clean adventure that inspires imagination. The DVD's have great content but lack the subtitles that we like to have in the DVD. The rest of the content is great though with great narations and behind the scene history. Highly recommended for the family library."
5,Best trilogy ever! Even better on VidTaggr.com,"As a typical Back to the Future nut, I've seen all three movies countless times. I've spent far too much time reading information and trivia and just love this trilogy because it's fun, light and easy to identify with Marty as a teenager with bullies, parents, cars, girlfriends, etc.I'm REALLY excited tagg and see what other people tagg for BTTF on VidTaggr ([...]). There's so much fun and interesting info and trivia out there, I can only imagine...This is a great set to buy. I think kids of any age can enjoy it because it relates to real life, with that sci-fi twist."
4,Eeven today,"Its just incredible how good this movies are, i mean they got it all, and by the time they were release they had great effects, even now there are some movies that doesnt have such a good effects .... you now low budget movies. Anyway i really like the movies, but the only thing i cant be sure, its wether its a wide screen version or its just a cut version like they cut up an down and say its wide screen...."
1,"Oh my, what an inexcusable fiasco from universal!","When I received this for Christmas the year of its release, I was unaware of the framing issues. I had to ship parts 2 and 3 back to them for replacements. On top of that, there were warbling sound issues with part 2, and the Michael J. Fox interview ran about 8 chapters before kicking you off and back to the main menu.(This was reported on many websites) Also, the trailers were all full screen, not widescreen. Apparently all of these issues have been fixed in the 2005 re-release. The thing that angers me the most is that since I couldnt return part 1 to universal initially, ive got a disc with the trailer in fullscreen instead of widescreen....ughhhh. I can live with it in fullscreen and I am not gonna exchange the set for a 2005 set because who knows what more crap ill have to go through with Universal. Thanks for nothing......pass this one up until its reissued with new features!!"
1,"Don't buy this one, buy the uk limited edition for 15$ more","If you are going to buy back to the future, don't buy this version. Go to amazon.co.uk and buy the limited edition tin. It's about 15$ more but gives you tons of memorobelia, better packaging, pictures, posters, it's AMAZING!That edition plays on all u.s. Blu Ray players and ps3's (that's what I watch it on)I picked the cheapest shipping and it got to me from the uk to California in 4 days even though it said delivery estimate 2 weeks!!Also picture quality on these blur ays will blow you out the water, bttf has never ever looked this good, don't listen to those losers who stick their face to their tv to look for imperfections."
5,ultimate 80s movie,"all time favorite movie! when you think of the all the movies that came out in the 80s , back to the future always brings back the best of memories of growing up in the 80s!"
5,5,"Greatest movies ever! I don't need to write another 17 words because the first 3 say enough to know about the movies, by the way, they are the greatest movies ever."
5,Good Trilogy and Good Value for Three Disc Set,"Back to the Future is a very enjoyable trilogy and this three disc set edition is well worth the price. There are also a lot of cool extra features on the disc. For example, you can watch the movie and when an icon pops on the screen, you can press play again and get commentary about the scene from Michael J. Fox, which was very interesting. The ""Making of"" features and interviews were also nice."
4,"Awesome Movies, Awful Packaging.","If you're a kid from the 80's and 90's you grew up with these movies and need no explanation of how awesome these films are, so what I will tell you is that the packaging and price suck so if you are able to do so (have a region free DVD player)order the UK version of this set as it is cheaper and has a really cool steelbook packaging.heres the link:http://www.amazon.co.uk/Back-Future-Part-DVD/dp/B001CP4VOS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1267407398&sr=8-1"
2,Back to the future trilogy,"I purchased the DVDs (3) through Amazon from a supplier that I had never used before because Amazon reported that the supplier had a good reputation. The order arrived in ""apparently"" good condition. I played disc one and it was excellent. The next one was viewed several weeks later and was defective. The third one was fine. I wrote the shipper, and told him what I have just told you. He said to replace my DVD player, now four years old, because there was nothing wrong with the DVD he sent me. I have learned a lesson from this, a rather unhappy one."
4,Classic Fox,"It had been several years since I last watched Back to the Future. When the 25th Anniversary Trilogy came out, I thought I would give it a second look. The first of the series and the last are great, just as I had remembered. The second is just filler to get you to the last, but even the second one is a pretty good movie. I think it is cool that they covered past, present and the future, in ""Back to the Future""."
1,sequels flawed...,"BTTF2: Biff goes to 1955, hands sports almanac to himself and comes back to 2015. Hill Valley should've been changed to a gloomy ghetto when he arrived back to 2015. but in the movie, nothing changed. (sorry to put a splinter in such a fine movie)plus.. if Marty and Jennifer travel to future together, how could they meet their old selves? Whatever the future written should've been erased as soon as they arrive to the future. starting with their kids.BTTF3: Delorean needs fuel? why? It's been already modified to run on left over food trash by end of the original movie.(MR.Fusion). plus Doc had 2 Deloreans to work with in 1885 (One sitting in the cave and one marty brought in)..."
5,Great Service!,Amazon is GREAT as usually! Ordered before release and arrived just a few days after the release. Great pricing too!!
2,Not what I expected,"I bought the DVD version of it a long time ago and now compared it with the blu-ray. Really not much of a difference. A bit crisper maybe, but that's it! Save your money and get the DVD..."
5,Fantastic Film Facts,"This is a book of substance for serious boxing fans, film fans,and devotees of American sports history, complete with amusing anectdotes, fascinating facts and interesting quotes. I found it a great read, and am keeping it on my coffee table. Great holiday gift idea."
4,Just the book I've been waiting for.,"Just the book I've been waiting for - what a great read for any film and/or boxing fan like me! Each film's write-up is like a short story, chock full of interesting details on the film, actors, and sports icons. It's thoroughly researched, there are hundreds of footnotes! The book is a permanent part of my library; check it out (for yourself or as a unique present) and I'm sure you will agree. Here's hoping that Romano, a skilled writer, has another book in the works."
1,Quality Disappointment,"This was the 2nd of 2 sets of these dishes. The first set was 5-stars. This order was very disappointing. The color and print quality was nowhere close to what it should have been. First of all, the pattern was fuzzy instead of crisp. Second, the colors were very off. For example, the red apples were pink, the golden pears were yellow-green. My family unpacked the dishes and washed them before I got home. Otherwise, I would have returned them. The items were carefully packed and I received them within 2-3 days of my order."
1,Deceived,"After ordering this item, I was told that it was for 8 mugs only and not a 16 piece set as advertised. Beware of misleading ads for this item."
1,Less than perfect.,This set appears to be a manufacturer second. The colors are much brighter and lacking the depth that my original dishes have. Disappointing since I'm trying to match what's left over from the first set.
2,Sakura Sonoma,Although the pattern is the same these dishes are not the same quality as the original Sakura Sonoma Dishes. The bowls shape does not match the rest of my set. The pattern is much brighter. The first set I ordered from Amazon they arrived and 6 were broken they sent out a replacement set however those were broken as well. Overall a disappointing experience.
1,Made me break out even worse,"Somehow this face cream worsened my acne. I even stuck it out, finishing the entire tube, thinking my face was just adjusting and might come out better in the end. What a waste and a disappointment."
1,Disappointed!!,"I thought I try something new and ended up purchasing this product. I see no difference at all. The only thing pleasant was the smell, otherwise it was complete waste of money. For anyone interested in clearing their acne, I recommend purchasing the Panoxyl 10% BP cream."
5,It's fantastic,"This product is really work on me.Only use one time, I can feel that something different on my face.I'll recommand to my friends"
2,I received a used product!,"I buy a new product, but what I got is a used one, I'mreally not happy about that. The cover has damaged and the product has been used, I don't know why"
5,Outstanding,"I wish I had found this product long ago.It is the only thing I've actually rated 5-star on Amazon because I believe it rates it.It reduces visible zits when applied directly to them- sometimes in just a couple of hours.When applied to the whole face after a warm shower just before bed, you wake up with a clearer, cleaner, tighter face. The acidity kills acne-causing bacteria on and below the surface of the skin, dissolving oily residue, preventing clogged pores, and eating away dead skin.I found this product in Paris, and a few years later it started to be exported to the USA. Until then, I was spending alot of money to purchase and ship it here into the USA where I live. Now that it is available on Amazon.com, I'm so overwhelmed with happiness.I cannot possibly say enough. This stuff really is that good. 10/10!!!"
5,Great product!,"I love this product. I have used most of the prescription products out there and, aside from accutane, this is the only one that's really worked for me. I have very sensitive skin that gets easily irritated by daily use of most products, but I've never had a problem using this one. It's gentle and it works well. You apply a very thin layer of the cream on your skin, so that little tube lasts a long time."
3,A good read,"A good story, kept me reading most of the times. Tho some spots were a bit slow. Main character is very well written, you see many sides of her and get to see her change and grow through out the story."
5,Female Conan,"Holy Crap!!!!!!!!!! When I read the description, I thought this might be a interesting book. After the first two sentences, I thought this just might be a female Conan, and no I do not mean Red Sonja. Kelyn, the main character, turned out to be just that. She was able to fight off 4 trespassers and still able to pay proper respect to her dead mother by lighting the funeral pyre. Then set out on a journey to find her father, filled with action, adventure and trouble. Meeting new people, customs, and languages. Looking forward to the next installment."
3,Great book,Fun to read and just my kind of book. Just needed more plotting to the story. Better if more beginning history had been at start.
1,Not enough glue !,"After trying many times to get into this book, I have decided the author just didn't glue his characters to anything, like a plot, character depth, time, space... It was just hung out there. Annoyed by it all for the lack of effort."
4,Great story,"I loved this story. It was fascinating from beginning to end. The female lead is such a great character--strong, capable and caring. Lots of adventure and excitement throughout the entire story. The romance was sweet, the way that she grew as a person from beginning to end was wonderful. I loved it and intend to read more of her books!"
3,Wolverine's Daughter,I am finding this a very slow moving book and too many people to keep track of. Unknown names also slow down the read.
4,I am so mixed emotioned :-),"great book, kinda has that different world feel but so relative it could just so happen to be this earthITS KILLED ME THAT SHE NEVER GOT TO SETTLE WITH THAT CUTE BEATABLE BOY from the Traders. he was kinda hot----wish more details had been given regarding their love making--i wanted to know what was her thoughts on it. Its was like the missing reel from a great movie, watered down for the PG RATED. but with the tension between them ""HAVE MERCY KELYN!"".....i wanted to see him finally take charge, and show her something new, pleasurable. and her, finally led, into the pleasure that she evidently was new to.the belly dance, i wanna learn----her dad...oh, her dad. I don't blame the mom. i would so give it up to him :-). thick, skilled, gorgeous. (pops a vessel)GREAT GOD DARNED BOOK! WILD AND ADVENTUROUS! i await the follow ups, she must have more adventures ahead, with sexier men, more dangerous fiends, and please.....more love making details!"
1,Another bad story badly written,I bought it for the Elmore cover art. My imagination was far superior to the story contained in the book. I can't recommend it to anyone.
4,Wolverine's Daughter,"I am a great fan of the sword/socery genre, one of the best being the original Conan stories. This story was well written, kept the reader engaged and ended in an outstanding way."
3,Wish there was a sequel,This book is about a journey of a young woman trying to find her father and herself. As it unfolds you are drawn into their world and don't want to leave. Just think of the rich adventures they could have discovering the land and the past of the woman who was so important to both of them.
3,SLOW START,Had a hard time getting interested in it. took like 3 chapters but finally not to bad. needed to get with it earlier.
4,Quite a good barbarian story,"This book started and finished at the same pace. I don't go for books with page after page of filler, of which this one had very little yet still managed to describe and explain as the story progressed. I even tried the ""text to speech"" an my kindle hd, with a very surprised outcome. With a few quirks still present, I could follow the story quite well.All in all This was a very good book and I look forward to reading other stories by the same author."
1,Crappy Productl.,This toaster does NOT WORK. You have to burn your toast to get a partial image to appear. The ad picture must be spray painted on because it does NOT look like that when it's done. Very disappointed with this product. Save your money DO NOT BUY THIS TOASTER! I would give it zero stars but it is not an option.
4,For the passionate amateur,"James Higson gives a fresh look at serious study of the piano from the adult perspective. Far from scale practice and Hanon exercises, his instructions appeal to the lover of fine music and the 88 keys that produce it. Chapters include how to develop a repertoire, strategies for maintaining your practice schedule while away on business or pleasure, and the purchase and placement of a fine instrument in your home. A good read, with plenty of insight for piano lovers."
2,For me...awful!,"I gave Eco 5 stars and still believe it to be one of the finest crafted musical albums in years. This however, leaves me cold - stone cold. There is little evidence of the musicality nor the flowing, rythmic symmetry of Eco. As an exercise in understanding the evolution of the artist it may be a valuable addition but not necessarily a requirement."
1,Not a play,"First off don't get me wrong I love gospel music, but this was not a play. I thought this was going to be an actual play that you might go to the theater to see but it was not. It was just a mini concert. In the beginning it had a short movie about the Yolanda Adams, Donnie McClurkin, and Kirk Franklin, when they were supposed to young and dreaming about their lives, acting not that great at all, then it was supposedly to come to real time and all I saw was a mini concert. If you are looking for a ""play"" don't waste your money. I was so dissappointed I could not even finish the video."
3,be aware,be aware that the screen room panel that runs along the aliner body does not comform to the 08 expedition. Paha Que told me to send panel to them and they would redesign it. A year has passed with no response from Paha Que.
1,A Great Bible Sabotaged,"Both The Message and the TNIV are great Bibles. I was really looking forward to seeing them together. What a shock when I opened it to discover that it's printed in mouse type. That's 6 point type, the same size they use for the fine print in an insurance contract. A typical Bible is printed in 9.5 point type. So unless you're well under 40 years old, this book is not for you. For those of us on the far side of 40, reading this print for more than a few minutes will result in eye strain headaches--if you can read it at all."
4,Well received gift,"I purchased this book as a gift and it has been well received. I'd buy it again in spite of the many warnings contained in other reviews.As previously mentioned, the type is small and that can be a problem for many people, but I did find the pages to be bright. The bright page allows for a good contrast and aids the reader when looking into the small print.As to the cover... This particular cover is hardback which is mentioned in the description. The hardback cover is stout and has a refined almost creamy feel to it. I was impressed with it for the low price.Lastly, as a parent of teenaged boy that likes the paraphrase of The Message, I am particularly happy to see the coupling of the paraphrase with a quality translation like the TNIV. With this tool, I expect my teen will be able to enjoy the paraphrase while measuring it against true translation sciences.Overall, this is a great bargain on a high quality offering."
2,Not What I Thought,"I purchased this for my mom for Christmas this year and it just arrived. First, I was saddened to find it isn't actually leather. If the cover was leather it would be one of the coolest looking bibles I've ever seen. But it's man made so it's going back for that alone. Second, I purchased this particular one because of it's size. I thought a larger bible would have larger font. Absolutely not. I'm 26 w/ perfect vision and I had a hard time reading the text because of the font size they chose. Other than the two problems above, I really like the side by side passages and the feel of the book."
2,More a paraphrase than a translation,"In my opinion the TNIV strays too far from the original manuscripts it is based on. It is more a paraphrase than a translation. I prefer the NKJV, NIV, or NASB to this."
3,Not all the hits the way you might remember them,"I purchased this bargain disc because it featured Land Of 1,000 Dances by Cannibal & the Headhunters, which is becoming kind of hard to find. Other part rock favorites like Wooly Bully, Mony, Mony and devil with the blue dress made it hard to resist. However, the Kingsman's Louie, Louie is not the original recording and I'm not too sure about Wooly Bully. They don't sound like the versions I usually hear on oldies radio. On the positive side, the sound is good and all of the tracks are upbeat."
4,Excellent ideas,"Less is More seems to be a confusing title. It is more about successful companies that do more of the things that unsuccessful companies seem to do less of. It focuses on a few excellent companies that seem to have the ""In Search of Excellence"" qualities of focusing on customers, employees, and doing things right. Mostly ideas that are easy to agree with, but for almost all companies hard to implement.Stories are well told with good illustrations of points though out. Hopefully most companies will read this and look at themselves and improve. I plan on giving this book to several key people at the company I work at, and hope it will change their perspective on what is important. I urge others to share this book with anyone in a decision making position at any company."
2,Certainly not a 5 star book,"This book gave me some interesting ideas. But I have found books from Peter Drucker more original and informative.Also half way through it just gets too repetitive and , lacks cohesion and organisation. Better books out there for the subject."
5,The answer is in our people!,"Jason Jennings is one of those people who communicates well both in a speech and on paper. This book, published in the now seemingly distant past (2002), shares ""people in successful companies"" stories and how they do it. The examples he quoted remain solid performers almost a decade later and the reason remains the same: the leadership of certain companies are continuously committed to serving their customers profitably, but not at the expense of their staff. The message is clear, simply stated and yet, unfortunately overlooked by so many organizations. I read this book about 4 years ago and it is as fresh today - so fresh, that I intend to make it's message into a future workshop.Your comments and feedback are always welcome!John HoganHospitalityEducatorsHoganHospitality"
3,Not so much about productivity as it is about commonsense,"Personally I enjoyed reading the book. It is indeed a page turner. However, I cannot make similar comments about the scientific validity of the arguments. They are mostly based on anectodal evidence. Also, the book is not about productivity per se, contrary to what the title implies. It is more like 'management by commonsense', i.e. well-proven methods which are increasingly coming out in the management literature these days. Real productivity issues emerge in the last section of the book, after you have been 2/3s through. Naming every 'good' practice as productivity obviously does not make much sense. Also, there are some really naive comments about productivity at places...."
3,Smells Divine but Scent Does Not Last,"I'm absolutely in love with the smell of this cologne. It's gardenia with a little extra ""summery"" kinds of scents but mostly gardenia.Maybe I got a bad bottle or something but I find the scent of this doesn't last at all. Within a half hour of applying it, I can only smell it if I put my wrist right up to my nose. I thought maybe it was just my sense of smell or my allergies were kicking in or something but my husband couldn't smell it either unless he got really close.I wear Elizabeth Arden ""Red Door"", Diane Von Furstenberg ""Tatiana"", Estee Lauder ""Beautiful"", Elizabeth Taylor ""Passion"" on a fairly regular basis and also different bath and body works sprays and have never had a scent fade on me so quickly.I don't want it to reek or anything but I need for it to be longer lasting. I can't be applying it every hour and for that reason, I don't think I would buy it again but will look for another gardenia perfume."
2,it was awful!,"I bought this thinking it would smell good, but it was awful! It smells like rotting flowers. My husband asked what the bad smell was. Sadly, it was me. I scrubbed it off immediately. I know fragrances smell different on everyone, but this smelled awful before in the bottle, not just on my skin."
3,The book has an outdated feel to it,"This is from 2004, and it seems to have the feel of a book that's so much older. Still, I liked what I read when I got it from the library, so I think I'll go ahead and buy it. It'll help me decide if I need to go ahead and find a library science program and change careers midlife! And by the way, I make it a point to NEVER trust five-star reviews, especially if they are the only one given so far."
2,Not practical,"Great idea...can't read it. Not organized well. Use an app instead; a good one is ""Spanish-English Dictionary"" - it's free."
3,Spanish,"This card would be great for someone just learning Spanish. I am practicing for the CLEP test so I need something a little more advanced. However, I think this would be better if it had some ""exceptions to the rules"" ex. Las Manos, La photo, El dia, etc. But overall a good product for the price for beginners"
5,Its a fluke!,"Product sell itself.Have to change clips. should have gotten 19800009. Like redial feature the most. LED indicator.Works -very clear tones, looks good/professional and have a 'old school' feel.However, no comparison to digital."
2,Not for the advanced container gardener,"I hate to give a less than stellar review but this book had nonew information for me. This is not the book for you if you've readother garden books or consider yourself an experienced gardener. Sometimes I just get one tidbit from a book that's useful, that's fine. This book was a real dud for me. END"
4,An interesting and fast paced book.,"The back of the book says:Someone was trying to kill Andrea Kirkland. And with good reason. For she was the only witness to a murder. A murder her mind refused to recall. A murder assistant D.A. John Cohen needed her to remember so that she could testify and put an end to the threats, the danger. Until then, John felt duty bound to protect her. Just until the murderer was found, he told himself. After all, she was his key witness. But once the passion exploded between them, the rugged D.A. came to realize that his key witness had come to mean so much more...This book had well developed characters and a lot of mystery/romance. They did not rush anything except for the ending which seemed a little unbelievable. Fortunately, I do not read these books for realism!"
5,conditions your lashes also,"I will purchase nothing but Lancomes Effacil to remove eye make-up. My eyes always stung after using every other product. I have also noticed that after I've wiped the mascara off, if I use a cotton ball and apply a little extra to my lashes, they grow fuller and longer. I have to attribute that to the fact that I believe it conditions your lashes.I have used it for several years now,and will use nothing else. I love it !!!"
2,Basic,As an inexpensive starting point for getting to grips with Director its not bad. Neverthless it is basic and those with even an intermediate knowledge of the application should avoid as it only barely touches on Lingo and very soon renders itself redundant .Best to invest in a book with a longer shelf life that will guide you from the outset to more advanced topics.
1,Very disappointing,"When I see a title ""QuickStart"" I assume I'm going to get worked through hands-on projects to work through. This book does not give you that. You don't even get a single ""First Project"" example.Instead you get you a mis-mash of mini-procedures that are incomplete and unclear. The books that come with Director are better than this."
2,dissapointing,"although it's about the only thing out about MX, you'd be better off waiting to buy a book that comes with example files on a CD or companion web site, or just get something on 8.5. this has nothing. it's all ""do this, do that.."" but provides no image, sound, scripts, or movies to work with."
5,half off!,i love amazon.com for this reason! this part for my car (2004 saab 9-3) was half the price anywhere else. it came in two days and of course was free shipping with my prime membership. thank you amazon for getting me the part to fix the darn fan blower for less money!
5,"Oustanding system, Awesome sound","I just got this system 2 weeks ago and IT ROCKS!Installation is quite easy, but the setup a little bit tricky as other reviewers stated. You need to read the manual, especially to setup the DVD player so that it will output DTS or Dolby Digital 5:1 signals to the A/V Amplifier. Once done, set the A/V amp on auto detect and enjoy the show. You'll see the A/V amp tell you if it is DTS sound or Dolby Digital, the little blue light is on, meaning you are truly experiencing the movie as it was released in theater.LOTR, Black Hawk Down, Matrix, Gladiator are movies you want to really demonstrate the quality of this system. Lots of special effects, great sounds, and a lot of rumbling..."
3,Amazon Marketplace Buyers Beware,"I bought two copies of this supposedly Hardcover textbook from the Amazon Marketplace. Both sellers sent me cheap foreign bootleg paperback copies of this textbook, NOT the hardcover edition described in the main Amazon listing. So if you are buying one of the used copies (the cheap $10 copies, especially if they say it is coming from India) be aware that you are getting a cheap inferior imitation version of the book that, technically, is against Amazon rules to sell here."
1,Best Argument for Socialism...,"Olasky,who has published for racist Bob Jones's perodical ""The World,"" is a strong apologist for death-penalty addict George W. Bush. Somehow, though, he's never spoken about about benefactors like Jones.We can see the ""miracle"" Texas has become from Bush- guided by Olasky's philosophy.The death penalty applied to probably innocent people. People who were denied DNA tests to prove their innocence. Pollution so bad it chokes schoolchildren.Not to mention the unending hypocrisy of the War on Drugs.Olasky's one of these guys that thinks religious indoctrination is ""the"" answer, but like his fellow-traveler, Michael Horrowitz, he can't escape his past.Olasky's compassionate conservatism is just hypocrisy."
2,Mostly bluster,"""Compassionate Conservatism"" by Olasky is a manifesto for a ""bread-and-circus"" ideology that grows more transparent by the day. Not surprisingly, it is heavy on rhetoric and light on substance.The alliterative title is catchy, but ""Bible-and-Business Conservatism"" is more descriptive."
1,Here we go again,"Do you ever feel that buying upgrades are a waste of money. Well, this one is a waste of your money. I bought into the hype that you can locate ATM's anywhere in the country and the maps were updated.If your looking for an ATM in Maine, Alabama, Vermont, Wisconsin, and other states, don't bother. Streets and Trips show there are no ATM's in most of the United States. Canada has a few.The Maps are not updated as well. A seven year old neighborhood still isn't showing up in Streets and Trips. Other programs and the internet map sites have had our neighborhood for a few years.If you have an old copy of Street and Trips or MapPoint, continue to use and save your money. I guess this is how a company can continue making a billion dollars a month without creating anything new. Lets hope in a few years Streets and Trips will be brought up to date and include what the marketing guys tell us."
4,Music that cracks me up.,"This song is funny. I like Heavy metal, hard rock, and alternative, but whenever I hear this song, it cracks me up. It all started just yesterday when I got an ipod mini for my birthday. When I went over my cousins house to get some songs from itunes, I heard this song called the ding dong song and the first time I heard it, I cracked me up. I downloaded this song just for kicks, but I kind of like it overall."
2,good but i wouldn't buy again,"The ball style plunger is by far the most useful tool in clearing a clog in my professional plumber opinion. The part I don't like about this particular one is the rubber is too soft especially near the handle connection. If you need to clear a clog, buy this style rather than the home depot special, but look for a better quality rubber."
1,Disappointed,There are scenes missing from the original!!! I would not buy the dvd until they are restored!!!
4,No outtakes and no full commentary by Brooks!,The film Blazing saddles is one of the best post counter-culture comedies ever made (written by Mel Brooks and comedian Richard Pryor). It is wonderfully surrealisic near the end with the western characters going to see a film called Blazing Saddles at the movie thater. The proibl;ems with the DVD extras are all in my title. By outtakes I meant scenes of the actors screwing up their lines not the deleted scenes in the extra features.
3,Funny in a bigoted way,"The movie was more his speed than mine. It was funny, but I found some of the script to be very uncouth."
1,Sophomoric!,"If you like tasteless juvenile humor then you'll probably like ""Blazing Saddles."" ""Blazing Saddles"" is a long, drawn-out movie with an absurd plot and much of the humor is at the high school level. This movie is long on hype and short on substance so don't waste your money on it. If I could, I'd give this movie a zero."
1,What a terrible movie,Blazing Saddles is one awful movie. I have not see a movie in this day of age that is so dumb.
1,Tasteless and lame comedy à la Family Guy,"Racism, sexism. Every ism thrown together so as to almost induce vomiting. I heard before watching that this movie was ""politically incorrect"". That is not the half of it! This is clearly only meant for the enjoyment of white men who have no sense of social equality or for the brainless of any race or sex, i.e. the kind of people who enjoy watching Family Guy.If you want a silly but clever Western spoof, watch the Paleface"
2,outdated humour even for the 70's,Perhaps it was the sorry state of physical comedy in the 70's that makes people think this is a classic but personally this kind of humour that relies on cheap ethnic jokes (aka Don Rickles) can pass away and I wouldn't shed a tear. I know people heap praise on Blazing Saddles by saying this movie couldn't be made today or people are too P.C. but this movie is just plain bad as well as offensive. If there is some roundabout moral paradox that Brooks is really trying to reach for it gets lost in the shuffle just leaving the bad taste of this so called humour to linger.
1,No,Unfunny. Badly timed. Tedious gags. Silly. Uninteresting. Dull. Simple-minded. Fast-forward. Regret buying. Give it away.
4,Funny!,"Great cast, of comedians reak the stage in this motion picture! Beware though! Some cntent not for children at all."
5,FUNNY!!!,Watched this with my family. Definitely a movie I would recommend to my friends!! I will watch this over and over and over again!
5,A movie for Dad,"Blazing Saddles was one of my fathers favorite movies of all time. I remember as a boy he would laugh so hard he would have to run, not walk, to the bathroom. Now that he has been deceased 9 months moments like watching Blazing Saddles with him take on new meaning. My old man used to laugh everytime Mel Brooks came on camera. The absurd, yet womanizing mayor portrayed what most of us think of politicians perfectly. Gene Wilder was at his best in this film, ""Little [..] shot me in the a**."" Sheriff Bart is the ultimate straight man in this film. In all the Mel Brooks movies I dare anyone to find a better one (which isn't to say there are not some close seconds).In my humble opinion Blazing Saddles is a true classic. Off colored comdey without taking it too far. This is not toilet bowl humor. No, only good laughs that are off color yet not disgusting.This ones for you Dad."
4,Almost lost a 40 dollar cart,"This movie, is the best, from when i was a little boy i watched this movie, 20 years later i still love it like the first time i saw it. It is an spoff that has to have the highest credit. So glad to see it on DVD."
4,Blazing Saddles,"The ultimate in directing, Mel Brookes does an unbelievable job of both directing and writing for this film. It looks and feels like a real western, but it isn't, it's the most brilliant spoof ever created to date. It's very funny, If you're thinking of either buying or renting this movie, I strongly suggest you do.The story is about an african american ""slave"" (Cleavon Little) who is to be hung, but Hedley Lammar has other plans for him. He sends Bart to Rock Ridge. He hopes having a black sherrif will drive all the people from rock ridge in order to run his railroad through it. But Jim (Gene Wlder), who befriends Bart, has different plans for the town."
5,Great fun!,Maybe you have to have somewhat of a warped mind to truly enjoy this slap-stick western...it's a classic in our house!
5,classic,good luck trying to make a movie like this now...all the bleeding hearts cant allow such silliness....they can pound sand
5,"Funny, funny, funny","Probably the funniest movie of all time, Mel Brooks and Harvey Korman at their best. There are so many one liners in this movie and so many funny moments it is hard to pick just one. However, that being said, the politically correct in this country would have a field day with this movie."
5,Great,"This is, without a doubt, one of the funniest movies ever made. What's not to like. The acting is terrific, the blue ray audio and video is terrific, and to watch it is an instant way to lift any depressed feelings you may have. Delivery was on time. Yea Amazon."
4,Blazing Sadles in Blu Ray,"I thought the studio did a great job making this in blu ray. For a 30 year old film, it's looked very good. It's a classic Mel Brooks film, probably his best. Very funny."
4,Where are the missing scenes?,"I've been a Blazing Saddles fan since the movie came out and was looking forward to seeing some of the scenes that were cut out of the TV versions. I was surprised to find that some of the scenes were missing from the DVD as well. For example, there were several scenes where Bart was trying to capture Mongo where he was unsuccessful before the Candygram scene that weren't in the DVD. Also, Mel Brooks has a scene in the fake Rock Ridge set where he imitates Harpo Marx that wasn't in the DVD. I'm hoping that they issue a DVD that has an uncut version in the near future."
5,CLASSIC BROOKS,"Always will reign as one of his crowning achievements - and a true tribute to the comic genius of Harvey Korman, Madeline Kahn and Cleavon Little. I can watch it over and over and still howl with laughter."
5,Mel Brooks is a comedic genius!,Mel Brooks has made some of the best comedy movies in the history of cinema and I think Blazing Saddles is his best. Definitely my favorite Mel Brooks movie!
4,Awwww,"Like the movie, its hilarious, but i could have saved by waiting a couple of weeks for this, cause it came out at target for 6.50, darn it!"
5,Blazing Saddles (30th Anniversary Special Edition),Excellent movie that doesn't age. I laughed just as hard as I did the first time I saw it.
3,Funny in spots.,"I enjoy pointless vulgarity as much as anybody (and more than most!) but with Wilder and Little barely able to suppress laughing and the obnoxious Harvey Korman this is like a reel of outtakes. Thank god Tim Conway isn't in this, too. Why are these guys so full of themselves? Compare the way these buys play comedy vs. the cast of Airplane, for example.Well I'm glad they all had so much fun! But when the premise is funny the overacting and hamming it up aren't necessary. Mel and Slim Pickens almost save the show because they know how to play it without breaking up."
2,Hit and miss humor.... mostly misses.,"Being a classic Mel Brook's film does not keep me from giving a rating I think this movie deserves. A bad one. This is coming from a big parody fan. Most jokes are unfunny and the characters aren't nearly cartoony enough, with the exception of Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks himself. The main villain couldn't be less funny. I think a good parody requires a hilarious, over the top villain and the movie completely fails in this respect. I judge parodies by how often and how hard they can make me laugh and this one only made me chuckle every ten minutes or so. That just isn't good enough. The funniest jokes involved Gene Wilder's character and his hilariously exaggerated reflexes, but there aren't many of them. The ending is ridiculously silly even by parody standards.I am a much larger fan of Brooks' later works such as Spaceballs, Robin Hood: Men in Tights, and Dracula: Dead and Loving It. In my opinion, they are all superior to Blazing Saddles."
1,"Guess what, people? I didn't like it!","I had such high hopes for this film. It came out the same year as YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, which is one of the best comedies ever, and Mel Brooks' best movie. And yet this is the worst one I've seen. I've seen all but five, and only missed the ones that aren't really important, like LIFE STINKS. BLAZING SADDLES has a good cast, lots of funny people, and people who work well with Brooks, like Gene Wilder and Madeline Khan. But there's about three good jokes in the whole film, and if you blink, you'll miss them. One of the most embarrassing movies I've ever seen."
2,Not my taste in humor,"I've watched this movie several times over the years and I just cannot bring myself to like it even though it is one of my Dad's favorites. To be honest, I don't like any of Mel Brooks' movies. The biggest problem with the movie is that is is just plain dull. The second problem is that it is not funny and relies on gimmicks such as the excessive use if the n-word. Slim Pickens and Gene Wilder are the only bright spots in this otherwise dismal flick. The HD DVD transfer is ok, but definitely not among the best like Serenity and Training Day. This is probably the last time I'll ever watch this movie."
5,Love Mel Brooks Humor,"Even those that have never seen a Mel Brooks movie will laugh until they fall down at the Blazing Saddles characters! No it isn't politically correct, but then MOST comedians are NOT ""politically correct"" thats what makes them so funny!! We have become so incredibly uptight about what is said any more that we can't simply appreciate humor from YEARS AGO!! Get over it and stop ""brain-plucking"" the movie. It's just plain old funny!!"
5,Mel Brooks at his best...,"If you're looking for a tasteful, politically correct movie for the entire family, this IS NOT that movie. It is classic Mel Brooks doing his normal irreverent job of providing comedy for adults. This movie truly is a classic and is a ton of fun to watch!!!"
2,"movie great, blu-ray poor","the movie is great, fun to watch even it's as old as it is. The cast and crew are timeless and it's worth the price, BUT the DVD quality isn't what you would expect. It looks like a copy of an old VHS tape. For Blu-Ray, very disapointing"
4,Classic Western Spoof,"Just as funny today as when it came out for middle aged and up generations and older. Some of the humor is dated and may pass right by younger crowds, but there is still enough general humor that they will enjoy. If you are sensitive to stereo types and words that are now considered racist and unacceptable, and can't take them as intended, you might want to pass."
5,Hilarious movie that had us laughing all the way through!,"This movie is so funny, and picks away at stereotypes in a way that keeps you laughing for the entire movie. The ensemble cast is perfect & you will watch it again and again to catch all of the little things you missed the first, second, or third. This is a classic in our eyes!"
4,Great great great!,I bought this brand new and it came from a warehouse in my same state so I got it the very next day! It was for a b-day gift. He loves it! It's a good old fun movie :)
4,blazing sadles,farts and all! it's in there. I saw the original years ago. this is pretty much the same. we enjoyed it.
4,The Start of It All,"This is the film that made Mel Brooks famous. What can I say about it? If you have not seen it, there is nothing I can write in this review to make you want to see it. Best western comedy ever? No-see The Paleface and Son of Paleface for that. Still, this film is legend."
5,Blazing saddles very good,I love this movie as I do all of Mel Brooks movies. Thanks for helping me to just about complete my collection
4,classic,A1 movie some scenes did not transfer well to the blue ray. But overall good. Nice extra features
1,Bottom Line,"This new ""30th Anniversary Edition"" of Blazing Saddles adds nothing new to from the previous DVD edition which you can still purchase through Amazon for as low as $6.95. A lot has been said about the additional scenes. Scenes that were added to the TV version but not in the original movie. If they had added those scenes into this version of the DVD movie, the DVD would have been called the 30th Anniversary ""Extended"" Edition. This is how the major movie distributors rape the consumers. They will keep releasing Blazing Saddles in a multitude of different formats until, finally, when people are completely exasperated, they will release an edition that has both the theatrical release and the ""extended"" version. Why did they not do this from the start ? Greed. Do not buy this version of the DVD if you have any other incarnation of this movie (on DVD, VHS or Laser Disc). The so called ""extra features"" stink and are not worthy of a compilation included in the 30th Anniversary Edition !"
3,No Longer Very Funny,"The humor in this movie is somewhat dated. Something like the three stooges. My wife and I viewed it, and the laughs were few and far between. We had just seen the new movie Django, and wanted to see Blazing Saddles which was the source of some of the humor. We did see, for example, the poorly fitting KKK masks, which was very funny in Django but only mildly funny in Blazing Saddles. Overall, it was worth viewing to gain historical perspective, but we were reminded that a lot has changed in the movie industry and in American life since Blazing Saddles was introduced."
5,A Classic,From the songs to the politically incorrect jokes no 18 year old should be allowed to vote without seeing the absurdity of modern prejudice through the eyes of past reality.
5,Excuse me while I whip this out...,"This is by far one of the best movies of all time, I mean it's Mel Brooks we're talking about here...If you're like everybody I know that has seen Spaceballs a thousand times and have no clue what Blazing Saddles is...swim back to the mainland and check it out...trust me."
4,"Great movie, but 2 scenes are missing","This is still a must have movie, however there are at least two scenes which I noticed were missing. First, the scene after Mongo gets blown up with the candy-gram, where the sheriff tricks Mongo into diving for treasure in a well. And second after the [pretend] Rock Ridge is built but before the attack, Mel Brooks comes driving into the [pretend] town and is shaking the hands of the ""dummies"". These two scenes aren't much of a loss, but I was a little disappointed that this DVD wasn't complete."
1,This Movie is so Not Funny!,"This Movie is so Not Funny! I sat down and watched this flick with some friends who loved it and i have to say what a waiste of my time. This movie tried so hard to be unny but was not funny at all. I know a lot of rebiews were good about this movie, maybe good to the older crowd who are in there 40's and 50's but for the hip young generation and sophisticated one like mine in the teens and twenties this movie is pure crap. Nothing good about it at all. I just can not believe people find Blazing Saddles such a great comedy. Oh well I hated the movie."
1,Most Overrated Comedy Of All Time,"This is the most tedious, unfunny, overrated movie of all time. It's interesting that this is from the same man who produced Spaceballs, which was actually rather humorous (though also quite tedious at times). I'll always be at a loss to understand why people think it's so funny. His utter lack of subtlety is terrible to behold."
3,This may be the wrong item,"Just a heads up, the sku barcode # that amazon.com has listed for the Blazing Saddles 30th Anniversary DVD is really the barcode for the Miss Congeniality DVD."
5,nobody,"This is by far the best comedy ever conceived. When I bought this, I thought I knew how funny it was, but I was very wrong. This movie is not only funny, but amazingly hilarious in its wit and charm, and this is without doubt the funniest movie of all time. I nearly puked during the beans scene, and every body who was watching it nearly did the same thing. Nowadays, all movies, even comedies have to have a mushy part in it, such as that stupid end to Bruce Almighty, which would have been great if not for the end, and I am proud to say that this movie turns all would-be mushy parts into hysterical situations. To everybody looking to buy this movie, I highly recommend it with great enthusiasm and trust that you will enjoy it, because nobody who watches it can say that it is a bad movie."
5,Favorite comedy of all time,"I have watched this movie so many times and its still funny. I love this movie. Mel Brooks is hilarious. I have been quoting lines from this movie for years(which I probably shoudnt do since it has so many racial slurs). You woulndt be able to make a movie like this now-a-days without close-minded protesters getting all pissed off and ruining it for everybody. This movie is a true classic. If you think racial humor is funny then you'll love this movie. However if you are boring and PC and cant take a joke, then I advise that you stay away from it. Funniest movie I have ever seen."
5,Funniest movie ever,"this is hands down the best comedy ever made. Its one of those movies thats always funny and has more quotable lines than any comedy ever.Its also great to finally see this in letterbox because if you were used to the version that was available all these years, you cant believe how much stuff was cut out of the screen."
5,Shelton B.,Got here fast and works! Ol' Mel Brooks on the cover really sells it. Great movie and awesome bluray. I do not need no stinkin badges.
5,Great flick,"Blazing Saddles is a great movie with great actors,such as Cleavon Little as sheriff Bart, Gene Wilder as the Waco Kid, Harvey Korman as the villain Hedley Lamarr and Madeline Kahn as a German saloon singer.Mel Brooks is a good director and actor, he plays the mayor in this movie.So the 1974 hit movie is a great western comedy.And it has has a happy ending in this day's world, not in the wild west.The good guys win and the bad guys lose."
4,Classic Comedy by Mel Brooks,"Blazing Saddles is a hilarious film by the creative and very talented Mel Brooks. My favorite character in the movie is that of Lili Von Shtupp talently portrayed by Madeline Khan, who recieved an Academy award nomination for the role. The song ""I'm Tired"" had me roaring. Although, some parts seem to drag on, overall the movie is extremely funny. I do recommend this movie to a more mature audience. Not mature as in older, but mature both culturally and mentally. If you enjoy this movie I would also recommend: Young Frankenstein, History of the World Part 1, and High Anxiety"
4,Hilarious,Blazing Saddles is a good movie. I don't know what other people think. IT's a classic. How they make all the 1870s westerns rednecks and racists was good because that was the true attitude. Rated R
5,ALL OUT LUNACY SERVED SUPERBLY,"BLAZING SADDLES is now 30 years old, and ironically, no studio would touch it now, with its constant use of the 'N' word and its openly racist atmosphere. However, in 1974, Mel Brooks was poking fun at racism, without trying to inflame anyone---it just made for good humor then. There are many classic scenes in this howler: the railworkers breaking out into an a cappella version of ""I Get a Kick Out of You,"" while the ranchers try to get them to sing ""Swing Low"" or ""Camptown Races."" Harvey Korman's classic where's my froggie scene; Madeline Kahn's hilarious ""I'm Tired"" ripoff of Marlene Dietrich; Gene Wilder's lowkey performance as the man whose hands move so fast you never see a gun; and of course the flatulent bean scene. It's got so many anachronisms, it's hard to keep up with them and the climactic brouhaha at the movie studio makes little sense, but it's one damned funny movie and it still makes me laugh and laugh!"
4,Brooks Commentary NOT scene-specific,"I can't believe I'm giving this movie four stars instead of five, since it is my nomination as the funniest film ever made. I bought this new disc because it promised a ""scene specific"" commentary by Mel Brooks. Not true. My copy of this 30th anniversary disc has the same non-specific commentary by Brooks as my previous disc. It's still terrific, however, and is recommended if you don't have the earlier dvd of this movie. Also, the picture quality of the transfer is excellent."
5,"funny then, even funnier now!","Blazing Saddles was funny 30 years ago, it was funny then, and even funnier now!"
4,Funny If...,"If you don't mind the political incorrectness of the Movie, it is very funny. Mel Brooks is the only producer, director, actor that I know of that could pull this one off. I spent the last 20 years hearing about how funny this movie is and that it is a must see. I have finally taken the time to watch, and I do agree that it is hilarious, but I wouldn't want my 12-year-old to watch it.Cleavon Little and Gene Wilder make a good team. Little, playing the newly appointed (black) Sheriff and Wilder, as the local drunk/washed-up gunfighter turned side kick, turn an entire town around. Harvey Korman , Madeline Kahn, and Mel Brooks himself really bring it together. Who would have thought that the traditional cowboy actors like Slim Pickens and Burton Gilliam would have really added as much to the picture as they did. Over all, it may not be a must see, but certainly worth having if you like satire comedy."
2,Too much editing!,"Why do these film folks always have to edit out some of the best parts? If they have to edit, why don't they add it to the DVD as extra material?I have always liked this movie but I have never seen the full feature since they made it available on VHS and DVD.Other than that the DVD works well and I still enjoy this movie. I just miss the deleted parts."
2,tried to watch it again after a long time.,"As a little kid, I loved this movie. All the cartoonish candygram for Mongo schtick and the farting cowboys. As an adult I watched it, found it boring and was offended by all the questionable race humor.I give it two stars because I remember a funny movie i loved as a kid. (he took hmself hostage hardy har har) otherwise I'd give it negative one star."
2,Slow pace with some funny scenes,"This movie is not for the politically correct. Wished I had read the reviews before I bought it. It is funny, some scenes are very funny. The pace is too slow, if this movie had been made today alot of the scenes would have been cut shorter or edited out. Kind of reminds me of Saturday Night Live, very funny but some scenes are way too long and unfunny."
1,Bad movie; gave the thing away. what I though the producer/writers thought funny...was in poor taste and vulgar.,"Vulgar, not my cup of tea. Shouldn't have watched it. Knew zip about producers though I WAS TOLD this is what they do."
2,not as funny after repeated viewings,"Lets kill every oldest son, nah too jewish.Maybe this has been on cable way too much, or times have changes, but this just is not as funny as i remember it being. True, it could never be made today given the racial sensitivity of our PC era, but some of the jokes are just not all that funny. That said, Slim Pickens is the best part of this whole movie, every scene with him still shines."
5,"The Mystique of ""Blazing Saddles""","A real Mel Brooks classic. Mel & his all star cast don't miss anyone with their irreverent zingers & politically incorrect comedy. An unforgettable flick of endearing folks & witty lines, this classic film will always be one of the highlites of my video collection! How in the world does he do it?"
4,"After all these years, it's NOT ""so tired""","Just screened Blazing Saddles again after 32 years. And it still holds up. Classic Brooks slapstick. Puns and homages to pop culture (my favorite is the strains of ""Springtime for Hitler"" introducing Lily!). Enough re-quotable lines to keep a generation of movie fans nodding and smiling wistfully. The film reminds you that Brooks set a lot of cinematic ""firsts""; an observation underscored just a few days later as the cast and crew of Saturday Night Live ended a sketch by breaking the 4th wall and spilling out of the studio and into the streets of New York. I hope somewhere Mel Brooks was saying, ""Did it in '74!"""
5,Love this movie,"first off i loved this movie when i was a kid and still do today,as far as the case it was pretty flimsy as most cases are today but what can you expect for 5-6 bucks... movie quality is pretty good i didn't really have any gripes about it, but i do think that if your gonna call it 30th anniversary special edition it should definitely have some bonus footage or a poster you know what i mean,the shipping was great i got it the day after i ordered it so that was perfect... so overall i gave this review a five solely based on the fact that i love this movie other stuff can use some work but im not gonna piss and whine over a 6 dollar movie."
4,"Is this film hilarious? Oh, it's twue, it's twue","This hilarious film spoofs every cliche in western films, and it is sure to offend everyone. This is clearly one of Mel Brooks' best films (along with Young Frankenstein). In today's politically correct climate, one wonders whether any studio would have the guys to produce this film. Probably not. Fortunately for us, the film holds up very well, and it always rewards repeated visits. Feel free to leave me a helpful/not helpful feedback."
3,Blazing Saddles,"This movie is a little off the wall. What do you expect with Mel Brooks? It was funny, but corky."
3,Great Movie- Terrible DVD,"I was really looking forward to the release of this movie to add to my collection. However I am so disappointed I could spit. The movie itself gets high marks for sure, but on this DVD release there are STILL parts that are edited out! I can't figure out what Warner Bros. is trying to do with this movie. I've seen it in VHS format where some parts have been edited out, and now the DVD with other parts edited out. What the hell is going on? Are they just trying to screw with my head, or milking me for more money by releasing a Super Ultra Deluxe Edition in the future? Either way, I'm still [upset]. The video quality is good but the audio quality seems a tad over the top with higher highs than is really needed, ie: Too loud in spots, too quiet in others. So, In conclusion, you'd really be better off waiting until they release a completely uncut version of this movie than buy the ... one they have out now."
5,Incredible picture quality on blu-ray!,"I didn't have high expectations for picture/sound quality of Blazing Saddles on blu-ray. I mean, it's such an old movie, how good could it be?I was actually shocked to find it has excellent picture quality ...amazing picture quality, considering the movie was filmed in 1974! The edges are sharp, the colors are rich, I have never seen Blazing Saddles like this before. The audio is also very good.If you're a Mel Brooks fan, this one is well worth getting on blu-ray."
3,"It's Twue, it's Twue","Hadn't seen this one in a while, needed a laugh, still funny after all these years. Blu-ray had a pilot episode for a TV Series spin off which has a young (and with hair) Louis Gossett, Jr."
1,There is NO scene by scene commentary,"Yes, I love the movie as do most people, but I bought this edition of the DVD because it claimed to have a scene by scene commentary by Mel Brooks, but the only ""commentary"" is the same audio interview with Mel Brooks that was on the original DVD release."
5,This Brook's film ranks up with Spaceballs!!!!!!!!!!,"I thought that this was the funniest movies ever made. Slim Pickens was great as the cowboy leader. The one who played Hedley Lamarr was the best. I think if anyone is looking for a Gene Wilder movie that is like this one, see Young Frankenstein."
3,interesting coming-of-age tale...,"You get a slice of life in Sarajevo (before war broke out in the early 90s and destroyed the place.)Not a great film, not bad either. Entertaining and thoughtfully put together. Worth getting if you like this director's work."
3,Kusturica ... in the beginning,"""Do You Remember Dolly Bell?"" is Kusturica's first feature film. His talent for telling a story and for seamlessly composing multi-layered scenes is apparent, as are his sincere depictions of humanity. The movie as a whole is quite enjoyable, but unlike some of Kusturica's later works, it is not a must see film.The image quality of the DVD is very poor. To my eyes it looks like that this is mostly due to the condition of the original film material, not the quality of the DVD transfer."
4,hmmmmm,Well I bought it and I haven't used it properly. I did look at the content and they seem very clear for me. So its a good book.
