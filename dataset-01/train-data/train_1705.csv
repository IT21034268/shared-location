5,Most Complete Resource,This book is a must for caregivers facing a caree who has dementia or Alzheimer's Disease! It is thorough and written well and easy to follow. It serves as a great read for someone just beginning to be a caregiver and also works well as a companion reference guide to refer to over and over again! I would recommend this book to all caregivers facing this issue!
5,Very helpful,"When there is a dementia diagnosis in the family, you need all the help you can get. This book has a lot of practical information on how to handle different situations with your loved one. It was recommended to us by a doctor and we would also recommend it to anyone trying to cope with dementia or Alzheimers."
4,Help is Here ...,"This book was recommended by the staff at my mother's assisted living residence. As soon as I began reading, I felt a little bit calmer, a little bit relieved and knew that as my mother's dementia progresses,there will be a resource that will explain the why's and what if's of this disease. I believe ""The Thirty-Six Hour Day"" will be a great help for this family in the days to come."
5,A Lifesaver,I wish I had bought this book many years ago! It makes you realize you are not alone in your struggles of taking care of someone with memory issues. The ideas for how to deal with the problems are exceptional! Thanks so much for taking the time to write such a book!
5,The 36-Hour Day,Recently my 81 year old mother fell and broke her hip/leg in 4 places. She had been suffering from dementia for 2 years but we did not know it. The trama of the fall and surgery made the Dementia profound. This book was a God send. It told us how to handle situations and how to treat the patient. Everyone involved with someone with Dementia should read this authoritative book with very specific how-to answers to tough questions.
5,Like finding a friend when you really need one,"A close member of my family is exhibiting increasing signs of dementia. Although I am the sole caretaker, I have no experience in how to cope with such an illness and no one to instruct me. A friend highly recommended this bookThe 36-hour Day - Completely Revised and Updated --2008 publication.I ordered it from Amazon.com immediately. What a find! In plain language the authors explain what is happening and why. This book has shown me ways to cope, ways to avoid burnout and ways to empathize with what the sufferer is going through. I now am able to relax and to plan how to put the patient at ease, which in turn helps to reduce the pressure on me."
4,Informative,"I bought this book at my mothers request, because my grandmother suffered two sever strokes back to back and while she survived them, dementia set in. This book really helped me understand what may be going on in her mind, and allows me to communicate with her more effectively, and when she doesn't remember me, not to take it to heart."
5,A Must for Dealing with Dementia!,"Anyone who is dealing with dementia in their lives (patient, caregiver, loved one, or friend) will find this book helpful. I was so glad that I bought this book, as my mother is suffering with dementia. It is truly a God send to know that I can refer to this book for future reference. Thank you so much for offering this wonderful book. I highly recommend it to everyone I know who is dealing with this terrible illness. An absolute MUST READ!"
5,BY FAR AND AWAY THE BEST REFERENCE YET!,"THE BEST, BESTEST, BETTER THAN OTHERS I HAVE READ ON WHAT TO EXPECT, HOW TO DEAL WITH THE VERY TOUGH BEHAVIORS OF HOW ALZHEIMER'S AFFECTS THE MEMORY/COGNITIVE ABILITIES.INFORMATION IS SUCCINCT, DIRECT AND VERY HELPFUL.IT INCLUDES ALL ASPECTS OF BEHAVIORS, HOW CAREGIVERS CAN HELP THEMSELVES, ETC. HAVEN'T FOUND ANYTHING YET THAT COMES CLOSE TO ADDRESSING THE FACTORS YOU WILL DEAL WITH ON NOW AND IN THE FUTURE.THIS IS A MUST READ FOR FAMILY MEMBERS TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THEIR LOVED ONE AND HOW SUCH BEHAVIORS MAY BE MANAGED APPROPRIATELY.BEST READ...MUST READ!BEST WISHES TO YOU AND FAMILY!"
2,Lightweight...,Very superficial and general information. I've read a lot on this subject since my mom's diagnosis a couple of months ago and I'm frankly puzzled as to why this book is recommended so frequently.The Alzheimer Assn's website provides more thorough information. It's extremely well written and easy to understand. And free.[...]
3,This was a gift.,It was a gift for a friend . Her loved one was diagnosed with dementia.I hope it help understand the disease.
5,Worth every penny,"This is an excellent reference for any person that wants to learn about many important issues related to caring for a family member or friend with dementia. Key health care, social, emotional and legal issues are covered. If you are just starting down the road of caring for someone with dementia or have been doing it for a while and you are not sure what to do next, this book will help. It's worth every penny and more."
4,A satisfying read - all you can ask for,"Don't let the minimal art fool you. Hart's strength is his storytelling ability. Banks, the not quite lovable loser, is the central character of this story. He has a love (or a need) for movies and this aspect shows itself at key points throughout the book. If you read Hart's previous collected wook, The Sands, you should expect this to be better. Hart has polished his style even more to deliver a very satisfying story."
3,When bad sound engineering happens to good violists...,"The sound quality on this CD is not very good. It sounds very muddy, or you might say it sounds like your ears are clogged when listening to it. It's not always a big issue, but in busy or particularly abrasive music (such as the infamous 4th mov of Op 25, No 1) it becomes a problem. Unfortunately, the viola isn't the crispest sounding instrument anyway, so we need all the help we can get (in terms of good recording techniques.The only other recording I have for comparison is by Kashkashian, and the sound quality/clarity is significantly better there."
2,Aw,"Well mine died within a few weeks, though it seemed healthy at first. It would get a higher rating if the plant came with better care instructions. Since it says that it is an easy house plant I expected it to be suitable for someone that didn't know how to care for plants :)"
2,not enough bang for your buck,"A book that ended up how not to be a Jedi, maybe author was looking for this very description... don't know. It sure was a let down for me. Decided didn't want to read next in series... all about how to become the mediocre."
4,The force is with you Obi-Wan,This book was quick and easy reading and was very interesting. There is not a difinitive ending so you have to buy the other books. Other than thay I enjoyed reading this childs book - ruggedthug.com
3,intermediate level reader,tried to read it to my four year old who has gone crazy for everything star wars but it was a little to advanced for him. Finished the book anyway...an entertaining read
4,Good story.,Good story. Very good for those who wonder what happened with Obi Wan after the Clone Wars.
3,good book for its intended audience,If I were in Junior high I guess I would have liked it better... but I didn't have a bad time reading it.
3,A little bit too short. The simple story line makes it look more like a transition than a stand alone story.,"It might be interesting for a reader who has no previous reading experience on Starwars novals. For people who are familiar with starwars universe, this one is quite weak and shallow. The volume is simply not enough for a full lengh story. I barely warmed up when I reach the end. It feels like an advertisemenf for sequals. So if you are looking for a whole story in one book and do not expect spending more money in order to know "" then what?"", don't take this one."
4,Worth it,Great to see obi-wan in action again. Ex padawan Olin takes us on a fun ride. Worth it for adults
3,Off to a good start,I found Ms. Watson's writing style a bit clunky but the story moves along nicely. Each of the books in the series is picking up at the moment the previous book ends. The stories are very short -- reflected in the low price -- but are good reads.
3,She...,"Really easy read. Started off a little slow, but definitely got better towards the end. I'm sure I will read the next book."
3,"Good story, vocabulary too advanced for kids","My boys, ages 7&3, were looking foward to having mommy read them a chapter a night. It took twice as long as usual because I had to stop and give definition to almost every other word in the story. This factor was distracting and led to the otherwise Star Wars crazed children to become bored and ask me to put them to bed. I, on the other hand, loved it. Good story, wait for Jr. High."
1,It is just a wastage of time and money,I don't now what author is trying to say about Oracle9i Web Development in this book. Don't deserve even a single star.
5,Killer Rock,"In the 1980s the Del Lords, along with a few others like the BoDeans helped me stay sane. The great bands of the '60s and '70s had broken up or quit recording and music was in a dark period but Scott, Manny, Frank, and Eric just kept ROCKIN'. The Lords took their great musicianship and combined it with a punk attitude to create some of the best rock n' roll in years. To name my favorite Del Lords songs would end up with a long, long list. Suffice it to say that if you like rock n' roll played with passion and fire, you'll like this recording. Yes, there are some essentials missing but it still ROCKS. Buy it and find out."
4,My Favourite Band Of The Eighties,"A great complilation but a few favourites inevitably missing, Double Life and Soldier's Home to name but two. It's about time their original albums were released on CD because this was a band who reminded everyone what rock 'n' roll is all about, with short melodic songs played with power and passion. I never heard the live album but for me, as a fan from the outset, Lovers Who Wander was the band's weakest album, although their generous mention on the cover of the late British DJ Roger Scott, who championed the band, was a nice touch. I was lucky enough to see them twice in 1989, at London's Marquee Club supporting They Might Be Giants and headlining at Reading After Dark Club. The latter was a great gig and also gave me the chance to chat with both Scott Kempner, who was politeness personified, and Eric Ambel. The Del-Lords truly deserved greater commercial success and will always remain one of my favourite bands of all time."
5,Long Live The DelLords!,"I have always loved this band! For anyone who has heard the Del Lords, you know what I mean. For anyone who hasn't, buy this record. You will be treating yourself to something wonderful.The Del Lords were THE best band to come out of NYC in the 80's. It always seemed as if they got no support from their record company, and could not achieve the wide success they so richly deserved.If you're a radio fan, check out SAINT JAKE. It'll mean so much to you. I love this band."
4,Scott are back in town again!,"Scott Kempner is one of the best songwriters out there,and this CD is a fine collection of the best moments from the Del-Lords.There's a couple of songs that i miss on the cd but songs like Cheyenne,Judas Kiss,You and I,Hand To Mouth are unforgettable moments. Now we are waiting for Scotts new CD Saving Grace and it's a real killer i promise you."
3,Good enough ... but not exceptional.,"This product is OK. It's certainly edible; and the portion in the pouch is large enough for a meal for one or as a soup for two. It has a distinctive taste, not entirely to my liking, but it's OK. I don't agree at all with the reviewer who gave it one star and sent the rest back. However, I must admit that I did give two or three of the nine pouches to friends at work who forgot to bring their lunch. For those who are looking for a prepared corn chowder, I must really recommend the ones in the Campbell Chunky brand or the one from Progresso."
3,Just the basics here..,I had hoped that this would of some kind definitive work. I was disappointed. If you avoid riding in the rain... consider this the starter kit....
1,I guess I'm the only one,"I've been spoiled by Michael DiMercurio and David Poyer because I really didn't like this book at all. There are absolutely no interesting characters; it is just a ""plot book"" and the action is very predictable. The campy style is hindered by the use of pilot code names and cheap thrills. I'm going to go read Kilo Class again to cleanse myself of this nonsense."
4,"Great for a ""quick fix"" of military entertainment","Mr. Douglass' Carrier series are very readable and serve their purpose; entertaining while not making you think too much. I would recommend this series to the reader who likes the military drama/thriller genre. Unlike Clancy or Robinson (two of my favorite authors) whose works encompass many more pages and challenge the reader to not only keep track of many more charactors and details; Douglass reads more like the ""after action report"" of an incident. Like everyone there are times I enjoy a longer story with tons more back story and detail, and there are times when I just want to know the ""dirty details"" of a story. Mr. Douglass and his carrier series fill this need for me and I would recommend the books to any fan of the genre with the caveat of not expecting the same exacting detail and sometimes long winded verbage you might find in a Clancy or Robinson work."
4,The Full Single and Club Mix,"This is the full import single (from Australia, I think) of We Run This by Missy Elliott. A hard to find single. Amazon does it again! What more can I say?1. We Run This [Explicit Album Version]2. We Run This [Instrumental]3. Teary Eyed [Tiefschwarz Club Mix]4. We Run This [Amended Album Version]"
4,Practical Soirituality: The Spiritual Basis of Nonviolent Communication,"This short book is a good synopsis of Rosenberg's book Nonviolent Communication; I liked the format, which includes questions to the author regarding how to use NVC in relationships of a more spiritual nature. Also, Rosenberg shares his own spirituality behind this method of communication. A good little book to refer to on a regular basis."
2,Disappointing,"I admit I had high expectations for this book after having read The Surprising Purpose of Anger by the same author. However, unlike that book which is at the same time accessible and profound, this book is repetitive and trite. The entire point of the conversation (it's in question and answer format) is that within everyone is a ""blessed divine energy"" that is only accessed when we allow ourselves to experience feelings and needs, both our own and other people's, without judgement or evaluation. There are better explorations of how to do this in Rosenberg's other books. I can't help but 'judge' that this book is geared toward the new age crowd that likes to have practical advice sugar coated in mystical language, as if simply calling something ""blessed"" and ""divine"" somehow automatically elevates both the message and the reader."
4,Ford Truck Mania,If you like Ford trucks this is the game for you from trucks ranging from the Ranger to the F-350 this game is one of the better ford games.
2,not bad for the money,"I mean, ten bucks. what do you expect. you get what you pay for.you could conceivably play this game hitting only the X button."
2,"Terrible game, even it were free.","This game is terrible, I've seen it for PS, and own it for PC, and I can't stand it! The graphics are terrible, the gameplay is too similar to Diablo 2, without the fun stuff like the Horodric Cube, or the range of items. Save your money, buy DII and Lord of Destruction... you'll feel better that you didn't waste your money."
2,Try the PC version instead!,"Long have I had the PC version of Darkstone, and last month I purchased the playstation version, it was HORRIBLE!! it wasnt worth the 10 dollars, instead i returned it to the store and reinstalled the PC version and played it that way. there's no 2-character usage in the playstation version, and the graphics are way worse, my PC is a 96' PC and it plays much better on it. I extremly highly reccomend the PC version, but the playstation version stinks."
4,Darkstone,"This game was pretty cool at first. When you do a quest you mainly only got 10,000 gold. (goes by really quickly.) The dungeons don't repop guys so you need to keep restarting the game (server if you are in mplayer). When my brother, cusion, and I played this game we played from about 3 in the after noon till 11:30 in the morning. We would have gone longer but my parents made us go to bed. So i definetly recommend this game."
2,DS,"Now I know why there where not any screenshots on the back of the jewel case! If there where, They couldnt sell the game, Terrable graphics, Gameplay so-so, Little thought into quests and lvling up. Frankly, a disgrace to RPGs. Not worth the 10 bucks.Might I suggest FFVIII?"
1,Not even worth the ...,Its quite obvious why this is a ... title. Basically a very mediocre RPG. You can only play as one character and one player and the graphics will bring back memories of your Atari 5200.
4,PUT DIABLO 2 ON PS2,"WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT THIS GAME I WAS TRYING TO FIND DIABLO FOR PSX (LITTLE DID I KNOW) YOU CAN'T FIND ONE ANYWHERE. ANY WAY, I LIKED IT, IT HAD PROBABLE THE BEST CARACTER DEVELOPMENT I HAVE EVER SEEN. PUMPING UP ATTRIBUTES, BUYING SKILLS AND, LEARNING MAGIC (I LOVED IT). THE DUNGEONS WERE GOOD, NICE AND DARK YOU HAVE TO USE LIGHT SPELLS!! I HAVE PLAYED LOTS OF RPG'S AND NEVER USED A LIGHT SPELL (EXCEPT THE ORIGINAL ZELDA) THE 360 ROTATING VIEW WAS NICE, IT COMPINCATED LACK OF GRAPHICS. THE QUEST LEFT A LITTLE TO BE WANTED, BUT IT IS A HACK AND SLASH. THE LOAD TIME STINKS ALMOST AS MUCH AS DIABLO. BUT ALL IN ALL I LIKED IT."
4,Darkstone for ps1,Darktone is a very enjoyable game for the price. And if a sequel would follow sometime in the future i would buy!
4,"A pretty good game, that plays a little like Zelda","Darkstone is a fairly good game, with a good storyline, but the graphics arnt to good. You can take control of a wizard or a sorcerres or even a warrior. The control is easy and there are lots of different camera angles to chose from. You have to talk to villiagers and hermits, to gain clues in your quest to destroy an evil dragon. You also have to buy things from the blacksmith and other stores around the town. A quick hint, buy a shield and a helmet, because in the forest you will need them to battle with the goblins and skeletons that swarn through the woods during the game."
1,where can I get a strategy guide for this game (playstation),I want a strategy guide tell me where i can at least find one
5,For those who long for PC-style RPGs,"Truly a unique and pleasantly surprising Playstation game: good graphics, appropriate sounds, but above all a true old-school RPG in the style of Diablo. You can hire NPCs, you can purchase all kinds of equipment as you go, and finally: You can rotate the camera! Thank heavens Take 2 and Delphine finally got what so many RPG makers don't: we like to see multiple angles.At ..., you really can't miss. I would recommend this game at three times that price. If you're tired of japanese-style RPGs and wish your Playstation was a PC sometimes, this game is for you."
3,Snowman Soundtrack available at amazon.co.uk,"Don't read if you want a review on this album ""Walking in the Air""The cd mentioned in the title of my review comes with a small book attached to the cd case and has an added bonus- Music with or WITHOUT the narraration! Tracks include:1 The Story of the Snowman (15:30)2 Walking in the Air (3:30)3 The Story of the Snowman (Continued) (6:40)4 The Snowman Soundtrack (15:30)5 Walking in the Air (3:30)6 The Snowman Soundtrack (Continued) (6:40)Both tracks of Walking in the Air are sung by Peter Auty (I believe the only difference is you get the tail end of the Narrarator's ""Flyyyyy....."" at the beginning of track 2)This cd is one of my favorites in my massive collection and I only wishBlakes soundtrack to ""The Bear"" was available in this same format.Hope this helps the other reviewer here and anyone who is looking for the soundtrack to ""The Snowman"""
2,Still not really The Snowman theme,"The first track is not the theme of The Snowman as heard on the movie and sung by Aled Jones. If you want that version, and you should, then I'm afraid you need to keep looking.I listened to the samples and theya re OK, I really don't have a review of the whole album so don't pay much attention if you are interested in the overall effect."
4,Foundatinal,This is a good book for anyone who wants to learn what God says about our money and assests and how to use them for the kingdom of God and our lives
2,good learning tool,"I wish this came with its own bears, it would have made it easier. Its a good learning tool just needs to come in a full set"
2,Too small,I am a retired teacher and used the bears as a math teaching tool. These bears are too small for the three year old user. Younger siblings could choke on these. The ones I used in school were larger and easy to handle.
3,Lasts about a year,"This gel type protector will protect your precious TREO700W/WX from major scratches. A year after owning this, holes started wearing through around the cursor buttons and the edges. Where the gel connects around the stylus at the top, has torn apart after just 10 months. Palm should select a different material or reinforce the silicone. I do like the fact it holds the battery cover in place if I were to accidentally drop my Treo."
2,i love the product but they changed the display picture..,"I really love the mary kay's products, but when i decided to buy it, was because i saw another picture that i usually buy because is easily to carry it. but when the product arrived i got the one that they have in the displayed picture. I feel betrayed, because i do not have a compact and was not planning to buy one i feel upset."
3,A good entry-level book of the Eastern Front,"I would actually rate this book 3 1/2 stars. The first several chapters are amateurish and somewhat simplistically boring. However, the later chapters do provide some intersting facts about the conflict. Basic German strategy and intersting information on Soviet adjustment to the onslaught is presented in an easy-to-read narrative. There are pleanty of good pictures and some are in color. There are also drawings of some of the most important tanks, planes, etc involved. Although there were maps, I wish there would have been more! Overall, this is a good entry-level book on the subject."
4,my first audio update,"Tis was my first audio system. I bought it for my laptop to view films, listen to music. The first impression is wow, such huge sound from such little speaker! The design is very attractive and takes little space!By the way i bought it at Sears for 50 bucks! Only 50 bucks! Amazon shame on you!Now i bought 5.1 onkyo receiver,elite pioneer central speaker and two infinity bookshelf speaker. So i am using this jvc system as add on to my new purchase! These little speakers are great for surround sound! The only thing subwoofer is non-powered, so i have to use jvc av box too to make my subwoofer alive! I plug wire from receiver to aux!In general this cute receiver worth its money!"
3,it is okay,it does not come with the cable to connect to pcso you have to buy it by yourselfotherwise the stuff is good
2,Horrible whiny choruses,"I had listened to this band's masterpiece ""illusions"" and felt this band had to excellent so i purchased this album hoping to buy more in the future.Unfortunately, the band decided to butcher their music with horrible out of tune whiny sounding choruses -- This style of music might satisfy those who like mainstream crap -- but those who like original music will be disgusted.I feel bad writing a bad review of a band i liked so much for making illusions.I hope these guys have something that sounds better in their other releases but it seems only their early work is good."
1,ccccrrrrrraaaaapppp!,this album is junk. they shouldn't be allowed to carry the name Crematory after this. bought this on a gamble and crapped out big time. this is just European poser metal with keyboards thrown in just to really piss you off. this one angers me every time i see it. if you like keyboard slathered weak crap then this is for you. as a matter of fact you can have mine.
3,scare,"This book has beauty, yet its scary. How the men and women dress, I would have never imagined these images. The peircings, the make up. Scary."
3,Great game but not for young children,"Buying the Finding Nemo movie, we found a game attached for a PC. I installed and my five year old absolutely loved it. It was frustrating for her though- it was a demo and you could only play one scenario. With her enjoyment of the game, I decided to get her a Game Boy for Christmas, and the Finding Nemo game. Unfortunately, this is not the same game included with the movie. This game is impossible for small children to play with any proficiency. It is a nice game for older children, but you will only find a frustrated child if she or he can't read well or doesn't have patience to manuever some rather complex levels."
5,I Love The Finding Nemo,i Love This GameBoy Game. I just Got Mine and it is the ultimate best game out there. I mean I just love this game. It isn't to hard and it isn't to easy. I am a 16 year old and this is one of the best games out there.
2,Too hard for Kids!!,"I got this for my daughter who is 6 and the game is absurdley difficult. Most of the levels don't even explain what you are supposed to do or why. I am a good gamer and I just gave up trying to help her as each level is increasingly difficult and annoying, making you start from the beginning every time.The makers of this game clearly have not tested it with children and probably think it is easy because all they do is play video games. DO NOT WASTE your Money!! Shrek 2 is a far superior game!"
2,Too hard for young kids,"I am an adult gamer and I have no idea how a young child is expected to be able to play this game. Some parts are so easy, you can finish within about 2 minutes and then other parts will have you pulling your hair out. I wouldn't buy it again."
4,Nemo is fun for the kids...but REAL addictive...,My 5 and 8 year olds spent countless hours trying to master this Nemo game...they know the ins-and-outs and share them together...not sure it's healthy to spend so much time looking at a small screen...one good thing: they can save their levels and restrat at the same place...saves them a lot of potentially wasted time.
3,Too Easy for anyone over 10,"I beat the game the first day I got it in no more than 2-3 hours and I am really bad at video games. For little kids this would be a great game but for anyone over 10 who plays a lot of video games, this would be too easy. The stages are cute, good graphics, very well suited for younger kids."
3,Recommended for teens and younger,"I liked the movie a lot so bought the game to play on the train to work. I am 23 and expected the game to be like the movie in that it appeals to everyone, not just younger kids. I was wrong. It's pretty easy to beat and only took me a few hours.That said, its not an altogether bad design and would make a great gift for someone younger. As with any videogame, there are some difficult parts where you need to try a couple different tactics before finding the way to beat it, but these are few and far between."
4,Good game but can be better,"I got this game for my 5yr boy, I always test the games before let him play and I found that the tasks are repetitive, a little too complicated for younger childs but I think that after playing it a lot they'll catch up."
2,"Fails the ""erase"" test","The easel is sturdy and a good platform for a whiteboard in situations where you don't want to attach it to a wall.However, this item seriously failed the ""erase"" test. Only dry-erase markers were ever used and the only fluids used to clean the board were water and ""White Board Cleaner"" (from Sanford). In spite of this, the board is new useless because most of the surface is covered with writing that only partially erases. And we're not talking about slight ""ghosting"", but clearly visible marks and legible text.I tried talking to the company (Boone) to get some satisfaction, but got nowhere."
2,This is dreadful,"How can this be required reading? Isn't the world sick enough without being dragged through a fictional, bleak, projection of a screwed up future? With a plethora of enlightened, inspired literature, it seems a disgrace to waste brain cells on this."
3,Worth reading,"It was worth reading if you enjoy books such as ""1984"". However, this book was very confusing, especially at the beginning. Greater explanation of ideas and events would have been nice. I had no idea what the author was talking about at some points. Do not let the vocabulary in the beginning discourage you. The events towards the end were well thought-out and very original. It was a great ending!"
3,correction,"In response to rorscach12's review the ""make-up slang"" in A Clockwork Orange is actually russian. moloko=milk, zoobies or zoob=tooth, litso=face, rukas or ruka=hand, malenky=small/little, etc."
2,"""Dystopia"" is not enough","The overwhelmingly positive ratings for this book mystify me. They give the sense that, as long as you can use the word ""dystopia"" in your review, the book must be good.I respectfully dissent. There's not a single character you care about. The alternate reality never seemed realistic or to have an internal logic. Burgess is a good writer, and shows a few nice flashes in his use of language, but even these are few and far between. There's very little here that shines any light on the issues of today. Disappointing."
4,wonderful,"I'm a junior in high school, and I was told to choose one author and to do an indepth project on him/her. I was required to reada number of the author's books, research his/her life,etc. I had read A Clockwork Orange, and loved it. I wanted an author who would be completely different from others who chose authors such as Hawethorne. Well I am more than satisfied with my choice. Burgess is an amazing author, who's books are funny but at the same time eerily realistic. The Wanting Seed is a classic Burgess novel, and I recommend it as well as his others. I have not yet read a novel by Burgess that I didn't enjoy."
4,A Cautionary Tale,"The Wanting Seed is a cautionary tale along the lines of 1984 or The Handmaid's Tale. The novelist's objective is to get the reader to suspend disbelief, but I'm not sure Burgess completely achieves that here. His description of a British authoritarian society changing is a little too fantastic, but his characters do redeem the book. I enjoyed this, but unlike another reviewer, I think A Clockwork Orange is a better effort, though that novel does require the reader work a little harder than here."
1,Big disappointment,"For a portable easel for the school library I wanted something sturdy, easy to open and close and light enough to carry across campus or to take to workshops. This easel was very, very heavy; it was unwieldy, and the stand opened and closed with great difficulty. The easel arrived with a crack and chip out of the heavy grey plastic. I returned it immediately and chose not to replace it. Thankfully Amazon has a good return system. Unfortunately I had also purchased the carrying case they recommended for it. That came from a store affiliated with Amazon and not from Amazon directly. It arrived before the easel and unfortunately I had thrown away the original packing box; in any case, the postage both ways would have made it virtually unreturnable. Big disappointment."
1,Not worth the money,I agree with the last review. This is so not worth $250.My easel was also cracked just like the last reviewers.Is it possible that Amazon sent me the same one that was returned???
4,A light and enjoyable read,"When your brain is tired from the stress of work or everyday living, the gentle mysteries of Ms Brightwell are calming and inviting."
4,loads of laughs,"i first got gta2 for christmas, and i really wanted another game. But after playing gta2 and talking to a friend who got the other game, i realized i was lucky that i got this game instead of the other. even though the graphics are second-class, that is overshadowed by the fact that the game is pure fun. if you ever played the game ""driver"", gta2 is very similar but with more action and more of a plot. the game is also hilarious when you steal a car and the people chase you down the street. this is a very cool game, and i recommend it to anyone over 13 due to some corse language."
4,This game is sooo cool,"Gta2 is definately a fun game. It's kind of hard and there is a lot of swearing, crime, and violence. The graphics are also a lot better on the computer than the psx but I kind of like the way that the psx handles better. It's kind of a toss up but I give the psx version a 4."
4,"Great game, Bad Graphics","When I was at my neighbors house playing his PS2, the best title he had was GTA3. I still have a PS1, so I got GTA2. Now, it was just about nowhere close to what I expected, but the gameplay definately makes up for the horrible graphics, which is why this gets 4 stars instead of 5. When you buy the game you get a map. YOU NEED THIS MAP! Unlike GTA3, with the map built into the screen, you have to navigate yourself with this map. It would be impossible to save you game without this map. Overall, it is a game that can make you sit down for 5 hours and think it was 5 minuits, AKA: its good"
2,This game looks like it was made in 5 minutes........,"This game looks like it was made in 5 minutes. It has horrible graphics, and barley any improvments from the first Grand Theft Auto. If you like this type of free-for-all shootem up, pick up the amazing GTA 3, (my all-time favorite) for the PS2."
1,Don't Buy!,"Do not buy this game. It is terrible. The graphics are bad. The view is so bad you can't even see where you're driving. Also, its very hard to save the game after you get $50,000. If you want a good game, get GTA 3 for PS2 or Driver 2 if you have a PS1."
4,"If you have Metal Gear Solid, buy this one.","If you get excited about a game that gives you points for running over pedestrians and blowing up ice cream trucks, this is your game. Very good gameplay, provides hours of fun, and a good laugh here and there. The only thing holding it back from getting 5 stars is Metal Gear Solid (best PSX game so far) and the fact that the graphics are so -so. But definitely pick the badboy up."
1,Due to popular demand I am giving this a second Chance,"Given that I have upset many people with my controversial view of this (cough) classic I decided to give it a second chance.Let's see let's put it through the test.Graphics: 1 out of 5 (it fits on the Gameboy Color, that's pathetic for a PSX)Sound: 1 out of 5 (fairly decent sound effects, bad music)Controls: 1 out of 5 (these are the worst controls ever)Fun Factor: 1 out of 5 (I still returned it the next day)So there you have it. This is a very bad game and I would rather have my tounge frozen to a pole with rabid poodles knawing at my ankles than play this again. Word of advice, buy a PS2 and get Grand Theft Auto 3, you will not regret that financial investment."
1,"A repetitive, unfresh look at video games","This game was one of the worst games that PlayStation extricated. The game sounds diabolical because you hear that you are a crook doing stuff for the mob. The graphics are worse than horrible, all you get is a birds-eye view and crooked dialogue, such as ""Gimme that.........."" What's even worse is that there is going to be a GTA3 that will come out eventually. What I really want to tell you is, stay away from this [game]!"
4,"Gamer from Charleston, SC","I have played a demo of GTA2 and first thought it was pretty dumb. Once the mission started, I got hooked. This game is a lot of fun and very addicting. As a player of Metal Gear Solid and Syphon Filter, I have to recommend this game too. For mature only due to all the violence. Just allow yourself atleast an hour to play 'cause like I said, it is addicting."
4,GTA2 - Revelutionary,"The freedom you have in this game never ends, things can happen i bet the programmers never intended on. That is why I love this game so much. With the new car speeds the police chases are much more realistic and the graphics are updated quite a bit from the old GTA - A must buy!"
5,Fun Fun Fun,"This is total fun for the playstation. It lets you steal cars, but watch out for the cops. Remember to look for the tank in each level."
3,Good but could have been better.,"I first played GTA 2 on the PC/Windows 98. When I played it on PSX, alot of things were missing like the rocket launcher, and weapons near the start area, and alot of the voice bytes ( Wasted!, Job Failed!, Frenzy Failed! Busted!) aren't in the PSX version. That's why I like computer version better."
3,Fun in small doses,"Sure the graphics could be better, and the movement control is a little hard to get used to - but after about 5 minutes of playing I was addicted! There are tons of playful secrets to find as you wreak destruction all over the city and complete your gang missions. The gta2 is a great stress reliever but gets repetitive from level to level."
3,Last 2D GTA,"Grand Theft Auto 2 - Circa 1999GOOD:- A better version of the original- Sort of fun and different in it's own wayBAD:- Really dated graphics, even for its day- Gameplay is pretty old and controls can be tough for someWILL IT FIT YOUR TASTE:- A Top-down run and gun game where you steal cars, kill people, and live a life of crimeGAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- Grand Theft Auto- Grand Theft Auto: London 1969- The legend of Zelda: A link to the past (but a lot more urban and violent)ADDITIONAL NOTES:- There is a version of this game for Dreamcast, with slightly better graphics- There is a version for this game for the PC"
5,Great way to go out for overhead view.,"GTA 2 is the last game to have the overhead veiw, but it has the most weapons and best playing style of the originals, would definitely recommend for GTA fans."
4,As expected,"This was definitely how I remember this game. Classic, played it a lot when I was a youngster and decided to get some classics back."
2,It has NO MULTIPLAYER... *sniffles*,"Preface: I bought this raunchy little gem in the hopes of introducing my friend to the genre.Pros: It was in good condition. It was what I ordered. It worked just fine.Cons: The Playstation version is significantly less groovy than the PC version (i.e. the graphics were worse, and it had NO MULTIPLAYER, which was really the only reason I bought it) *sniffles*Overall: I wouldn't buy it again, since it didn't have multiplayer. Buy the PC version instead.Thoughts: I wish I'd known they were so different."
3,Old School GTA,"So this is old school GTA. It's not a bad game for it's day, but it has some definite age to it now. The biggest problem you may run into is that you can't save it on a PS2 system. You either need a PS1 system or try to play it on PS2 without saving it."
2,Boring,This had all the promise and excitement that a recommended experimental type film can deliver. One problem. It didnt deliver. I couldnt even watch all of it. Too wierd? No. Too controversial? No. Too experimental? No. Too damn BORING!!!! Yes.
2,Pompous and Self Absorbed,"Kee-Yawn-A-SQUAT-SeeThis movie was ok, a little overburdened with trying to make a statement rather than just shoot a great film. The creator of the film was a bit pompous in my opinion. I could barely sit through his interview. If you really want to see a spectacular film WATCH BARAKA!"
1,Life out of balance - for sure,"Koyaanisqatsi - I saw this film years ago and remembering it has always been a source of amusement for me. If you enjoy listening to a 2 year old incessantly banging on a toy piano, you might really like this film. The photography is quite good and to be honest the film does achieve its purpose. I might go ahead and get the dvd just because I was so irritated the first time I saw this film. I have not seen Powaqqatsi."
2,Not Up to Par,"The quality of the picture is much less than any DVD I've seen before. Indeed, dust and scratches appear throughout both DVDs. I'm a big fan of both of these movies, but the DVDs just do not do them justice both in terms of video and sound quality."
3,Powaqqatsi Cropped as well,"After reading the previous review from the gentlemen who owns an IRE special edition of Koyaanisqatsi I suspected they must have done the same ""image cropping"" to Powaqqatsi.Well, after comparing the Powaqqatsi DVD with an old VHS edition published back in the late 80's I can confirm that in order to go from 4:3 (VHS) to the 16:9 format of the DVD they simply cut the top and bottom part of the image. The DVD does NOT show extra stuff that would come from a wider picture.Very stupid I think. The movie was probably shot in 4:3 originally."
5,A beautiful statement about life,"Godfrey Reggio, Philippe Glass and Ron Fricke made a superb trilogy about human life on earth. It took them 20 years to complete their project! Only using images and (specially composed) music they are able to give an account on life on the northern hemisphere (Koyaanisqatsi), the southern hemisphere (powaqqatsi) and the synthesis of both (naqoyqatsi). I have never seen a better film without words in conveying a universal message without making a judgement!"
3,Correction on Roy Kristiansen's review,"Actually, the film was indeed released as 1.85:1 threatrically. I saw it on its original run in the theater ""way back when"" and later, ran it myself as a projectionist for the Nuart in LA. That print, too, was a 1.85:1 print (complete with printed masking). So, the DVD release is not a cropped version. He may be confusing Koyaanisqatsi with an IMAX film, Chronos, directed by Ron Fricke who was DP on Koyaanisqatsi - that film was 4:3 - the IMAX aspect ratio.However, I cannot, as of yet, rate the quality of the DVD because I have not yet seen it."
5,A Masterpiece,"The only shortcoming of the masterpiece epic ""Koyaanisqatsi"" on DVD is technical: the tape-to-DVD transfer is quite noisy: it's evident in some shots and colors where the shimmering ""noise"" detracts slightly from the visuals. Nevertheless this is a groundbreaking film, and seeing it 21 years after its cinematic release, yah it blows me (and anyone else who sees it)away.So hey GR howzaboot a complete remastering, on par with the excellent soundtrack remaster? This film deserves nothing less. One of the top 5 films of all time."
5,It is a crime not to re-release this on DVD.,"Truly stunning film. No words, other than the refrain of ""Koyannisqatsi"", no story, in a traditional sense, just incredible cinematography, Glass' superb score, and a series of images that will probably never leave anyone who sees the film. There is obviously a substantial demand for this film to be re-released, so I find it's continued absence on the market baffling, and a terrible shame. The other Reggio-Glass collaborations, Powaqattsi and Anima Mundi are also excellent, though Koyaanisqatsi stands in a class of it's own. Of the three, apparently only Anima Mundi is currently being released on DVD & Video."
3,Pseudo-Intellectuals will love this...,"Visually stunning? Yes.Great imagery? Absolutely.Make a statement? No.Fresh and original? Are you nuts? OK, so we're out of step with Nature, what else is new? These films reinforce that, but that's about all.They're a good bargain at the price, but don't expect anything more than audio-visual muzac."
2,What's all the fuss about?,"The first time I saw Baraka, I fell in love with it. Mesmerising, haunting, beautifully filmed and a great soundtrack. I thought it was a one of a kind till I heard about Koyaanisqatsi. Reading all the reviews I purchased this together with Powaqqatsi. What a dissapointment! both these films fall drastically short of Baraka. I found the music nausiating and the photography irritating. I really don't know what all the other reviewers are on about. I guess it proves that we are all so different"
2,"Sleep-inducing, obvious, repetitive","Granted, Koyaanisqatsi had a certain freshness and art-house novelty when it was first released, and the cinematography (which was better realized in Baraka, and accompanied by better music) is worthwhile, but the unspeakably obvious latter-day Luddite point is hammered home in the first 20 minutes. Many of the images have poetry, yes, but you can't make an epic poem of a haiku. Powaqqatsi ranks several notches below its predecessor, and is scarcely worth even a first viewing. The remastered dolby digital sound is great--if only it revealed anything worth hearing after five minutes. I can't fathom why anyone would want to watch either film more than once. I know of no one who has seen either who didn't prefer Ron Fricke's (director of photography for both of these films) Baraka instead. No wonder he didn't return for Reggio's final installment of the trilogy, Naqoyqatsi. He prefers his sleep aids in the over-the-counter format."
2,"VHS ""Koyaanisqatsi""","Nothing about the tape was as advertised: date, condition, use. It is clearly a library tape and has been damaged in several places I was disappointed, but am aware, of course, that the VHS format is disappearing faster than organizations are acquiring DVD players to replace it."
2,Interesting but aggravating,"These two movies are a montage of slow-motion, fast-motion, and time-lapse filming set to music. One shows the how man works and the other how man uses the planet. I wanted to like these but I found the constant image changing and music aggravating. They are very interesting and have good messages but I can't stand the constant sensory bombardment."
4,Needs to be released on DVD Video,"Wonderful composition. I bought a DVD of it--imagine my dismay when I learned that it was only the soundtrack. Furthermore, I can only listen to it on my DVD player. What a crock! Can't wait for a real DVD to come out."
4,"Light, Enjoyable Read.","In his quest to ""plant his seed"", and send offspring out into the world, Nick Broome will go to almost any lengths to get one.(And he does at points.)The novel isn't as laugh out loud funny as I had anticipated, but is touching and heartfelt as this gay man goes through a crazy journey to find what a child means to him, and what finally constitutes a family."
4,Two In A Row!,"After reading Mr. Bayard's ""Fool's Errand"" several months ago, I was anxious to read another of his novels. I don't know why I waited so long, since I thought his first book was astonishing. Finally, I read this one, not expecting too much from it, based solely on the subject matter. I figured as a single guy, I would not be able to relate very much. I was wrong. It is such a joy to read Mr. Bayard's writing. He leaves me constantly in awe as he describes people and objects with wit and a very keen eye. And the story, too, was very much a surprise. Nice job, Mr. Bayard! You have joined the ranks of my favorite authors, beside the likes of Jim Oliver and Peter Cameron. Can't wait for your next one!"
3,A good book by a great author,"Let me first say that Louis Bayard's first novel ""A Fool's Errand"" is one of my all time favorite books. I am sure that my friends are sick of me talking about how highly I thought of it. Of course, after they read it, then they know why I recommended it so highly. ""Endangered Species"" is good, and probably ten times better than most gay fiction. It was just from a personal standpoint, I couldn't relate to the main character. Don't let that stop you from reading it though."
3,Not as good as the first,"This time around, Bayard's characters are less entertaining, less sympathetic, and less realistic. It's hard to see why they're drawn together, and why we should care about them. The writing is still good, but this story didn't grab me the way Fool's Errand did. I'd try another of his, but I wish I'd checked Endangered Species out of the library instead of buying it."
3,A real American story,"Anna's story represents so many who immigrated to America. This isn't only Anna's story but in a sense the story of America and how we are home to so many from different countries. Much can be gleaned about the changes in American society's views on immigration from WW2 to the present day. When Anna arrived here being different was not valued, while today we toast to our diversity. Anna's war experiences shed light on what happened in Italy during the war to the average person. Her wartime diary is so simple and easy to relate to. It makes you feel like you were there with her family. This is something that can be reflected on as our country now faces uncertian times of our own."
2,Save your money and borrow this book from a relative.,"I did not find this book a must read for anyone. I enjoyed the book till the Part V/ Chapter My Two Sons. The author takes a weird turn in her life where she went from someone who looked beyond herself to someone who only could see herself and her needs.If you want to read this book just be advised it gets weird after page 217. I find it sad when someone loses her faith in God.I must admit I bought this book, because I heard that Anna's father was from Cersosimo, Italy--a place I have heard about from my relatives who are also from Cersosimo."
5,"Hasta ahora, lo mejor","Definitivamente, el mejor diccionario de su tipo que he encontrado hasta ahora. No sólo para el estudiante, pero también para el traductor. Si hay otro mejor, ¿cuál?"
5,The best English-Spanish Spanish-English dictionary,Albeit my mother language is Spanish and maybe this dictionary is not as complete for Spanish as it is for English. I really think that is the most complete dictionary available in the English-Spanish Spanish-English world. I can say that if the word you're searching for no matter English or Spanish is not completely technical you'll find it in this dictionary. And maybe if it's technical you'll find it too.
3,So-So,The item doesn't have terribly detailed entries however it comes highly recommended by my court interpreting professor. My professor was at one point the president of NAJIT and has been translating and interpreting for some 40 years.
2,Overblown,"This dictionary is O.K. for people who need a basic dictionary.Do not believe the cover: ""The most up-to-date and respected bilingualdictionary in the Spanish and English speaking worlds."""
1,Dictionary Webster's,My dictionary came with missing pages. The missing pages are from page 1367 through 14714.
3,"light weight, cuts well,","Cuts like a huge pair of scissors. Time will tell if the blade stays sharp.It's very light. Might be a slight problem for some, but I like being able to lift it up and plop it onto a desk quickly.The blade lock is sturdy.Rubber feet on bottom are tacky enough to keep it in place. Been cutting a few pieces of legal-size paper, but only single sheets at a time."
3,Swingline,"The listing is for a 15 inch guillotine but the company does not have such a product, rather a 12"" which it took me to receive two of them for them to tell me the listing is a typo. But the product overall is awesome and works fine, just not as long as I needed it to be. Also looks nothing like the photo shown, I would think they would have removed it by now."
2,hohum,"CONS - This paper cutter can only cut 4 or 5 pages at a time. Any more than that and the cut gets tougher, uneven and sometimes sloppy. It does not have a rear guard to keep papers flush. One must use the left hand to hold papers in place while using right hand to lower cutting arm. Cutting arm does not spring up. It must be raised manually.PROS - Sturdy plastic, lightweightIf I had to replace this, I would try a different Paper Cutter."
2,Not as listed,"Nowhere in the listing (15 x 22.5"" base) does it make clear the important fact that this cutter will only handle paper up to 12"" x 15"" in size. I don't care what the base size is- I needed to know what paper size it would handle. So now I've ordered this for 11x17 and an important deadline and it won't work- grrr...so now I get to return it."
5,Just What I Wanted,This is a very sharp and light paper cutter. I don't need it for formidable projects so it's just great for me and I would highly recommend it for light duty. My last one was very heavy and became dull way too soon. I would buy this again.
4,Satisfied with the Cutter,This paper cutter is just what I needed. I am an artist and wanted it primarily to cut canvas sheets but have used it for other purposes. For the money it's very good. The only thing I would change is to have the protective bar removable so I could slide a sheet in to cut that is larger than the cutter. I'm not sure that could realistically be done but anyway it's a very small imperfection. I'm very pleased with the purchase.
5,it's like the fast and the furious on your xbox,"Wow...how could you not give this game a 5 star rating?it's the first racing game to let you use NOS,the first racing game to have you involved in the game even when finding people to race instead of just signing up for events like in Test Drive or Apex.The graphics are good,LA,Paris,and tokyo has insane jumps and good backgrounds,plus the the AI comes off challenging but still beatable.My only complaint is the lack of a custom soundtrack option.it would be awesome to drive around listening to the 2 fast 2 furious soundtrack or some 50 Cent or JT Money.Anyway you gotta go buy this game right now.get your a$$ out of that chair you're sitting in reading this and go to your nearest [local store]and pick it up!"
1,Very Very Crappy,"This game sucks and so did the first one, you want a good street racing game get Need for Speed Underground. Thats all there is too it."
4,great game,"This game is a great game because of the live experiance, but without live it would not be so good. On live you can cruise the city, circuit race, and play a destruction game and other things. The graphics look to PS2 and are not to nice. Also there are no licensed cars, but they still look cool. The menu screen is very difficult to find all of your options. I also have midtown madness 3 and it is much better because of the graphics and more online options and licensed cars. But Midnight Club 2 also has three cities including Tokyo, Los Angeles, and Paris. There are alot of nice jumps on this game which make it alot of fun. The option of riding motor bikes make the game alot better. I would recomend you getting this game if you like raceing games."
2,STINX!!!,"This game is a big dissapointment and a huge waste of money. I bought this because I heard it was good and I can't stand it. The only reason I played it at all was because I spent $50 on it and couldn't return it. I love racing games, so it's pretty hard for me not to like a car game. All these other people are probably giving it a good rating because they just got it and played it for 5 mins. or don't even have it at all. If your looking for a really good racing game, go with Midtown Madness 3. That games alot better and plus it's made by Microsoft. You'll have a much better time with that, I promise!"
1,So sad,I thought that this game would be a great game.I played it a lot and realized that Midtown Madness 3is a much better game for the XBOX. MC2 was fun for acouple of hours but MM3 is still fun after a week ofconstant playing.
4,Best game of the year,This is a really awsome game and it has very nice graphics.Once you play cereer mode you start off trying to beat Moses in Los angulos you keep trying to beat ather guys in Paris and tokyo and ons you get to the last guy in the game his name is Savo he is a really hard guy he also has the fastes car in the game .It also has 2 player multi action that is all I can tell you goodby.
2,un autre jeu de char,"ce jeu est trop repetitif , tout le monde sur xbox live prennent la meme auto et c est repetitif. considerant qu il y a pleins de jeu d autos et pour moins cher je n acheterais pas ce jeu. les graphiques sont pas mieux que d autres dans mc2. j aime pas ce jeu car c est tres noir et on vois pas ou on s en va et tout le monde use les cheat code. je ne le recommande pas."
2,No valid license #,This would be a great product if it had a working license number so that I could print without a watermark. I'll be sending it back.
3,software,"Although I loved the programs, I discovered that if you update the program ( or one section) you must put in your serial number again. A real pain if it has been a long time."
4,audio program,"well, i thoguht i was ordering the dvd's at first, but it ended up I really need the audio program for the class i'm taking. the cd's seem to work fine so far."
4,In My Head too.,"Robert Lamm in his third solo effort displays his diverse musical talents, with his new sound and always distinct voice. Though different than his Life Is Good album,a few of the tracks seemed familiar in form. The cuts that caught my ear were, Love Of My Life, Love To Call Your Own, and Will People Ever Change. This Cd is for the open minded Lamm fan, that realizes that each Chicago member's solo album is not going to reflect the band's sound .All in all a worth while effort on Robert's Part."
4,Very Good!,Cd has a jazzy vibe that I could hear being played on the local smooth jazz station. Seems like Robert Lamm's solo efforts are what Chicago could have been doing had they been releasing new records all along since the 90's. Many of the songs sound like what you would find on a Chicago record.
4,"I was ""Swept Away"" by this album...","This new effort by Lamm totally blew his other two solo efforts off the shelf. Robert never wavers in his excellent writing and he adds to that and his great voice by adding modern, funky beats to bring his career into the 21st century. From social commentary on ""Will People Ever Change?"" to ballads like ""Watching The Time Go By"" and ""The Best Thing"", this is one you will leave in your player for days."
1,Very Disappointing,"I never thought it could get worse than ""Life Is Good In My Neighborhood"" but it is. But because I am a Chicago fan and have every CD that they and each member of the band has put out, I purchased it. Unfortunately, I will never listen to it again. Bill Champlin's solo project are far superior."
1,Just Killing Time,"The only decent song is the ""Time"" song. Can't even remember the full name as it is not that great. The rest of the CD is just plain bad. I expected a lot more from Lamm. I am a big Chicago fan, but this just shows Lamm isn't much without the band to hone quality arrangements and trombonist James Pankow writing a killer horn arrangement. It appears that Lamm is just killing time with this wasted effort. It has pretty much turned me off of any Robert Lamm solo work.Don't buy this CD!!!-- Buy some old Chicago instead!"
1,Worst $9 i ever spent,"I got this model in a plastic bag in my mailbox. The box was all smashed up. I figured 1/32 scale was small, but didn't expect ""micro"". I did expect a little more detail to make up for its small size, but that was too much I suppose. Next time I want to buy a model, I will go to a hobby store where I can see it first. IMHO, this model should not be sold for more than [...]I am very disappointed."
5,Keep on Rockin'!,"Man was I blown away! Where have they been hiding these guys? As a fan of roots-rock, I read a review of this CD in Blue Suede News Magazine and decided to take a spin. All exept one song were original, played under the influence of like-minded hombres such as Los Lobos, the Blasters, Stray Cats, and even the Texas Tornados. The vocals of Johnny Valenzuela were very strong and soulful, the bass thumped and sounded much like an upright bass, the guitar was twangy with lots of 'verb, drum very snappy. From Jump-Blues, to Country and Tex-Mex, these cats covered it all!"
1,"Not anime, not at all","I found this book at my local library and decided to see what this book was about after seeing all the reviews on amazon about this book. When I got home I starteded reading it, I realized that this book was not anime. I am a big anime and manga fan so I could tell. Christopher Hart can't draw anime correctly, his drawings are to american and not the japanese type ( like anime or manga is supposed to be). If you want to buy this book let me just tell you that you aren't drawing anime, you're drawing a cross between anime- and american cartooning. Which isn't really anime at all, so if you buy this book and give it to your kid, they'll think they're really drawing anime but aren't. for kids who just want to draw go ahead and buy this book. But if you seriously want to draw manga or anime i suggest a book by Hikaru Hayashi in his how to draw series which are accurate but somethimes not for younger kids."
1,Not anime!,"I picked this up in hope that it would show me some simple anime techniques, IE chibi etc, but it's not only badly drawn and poorly explained, it's also nothing like anime. Do not get this book, it also teaches nothing. Get How to draw Manga, or for younger kids, The Art Of Creating and Drawing anime women/action series's."
4,Budding Anime Artists Start Here,"Nice and simple, without too much information all at once, this how-to-draw book is a great start for younger kids, 6-10. It sets up the right drawing habits, starting from basic shapes and lines and ""building out"" the image from rough to polished. Much like writers have several drafts, so do illustrators and animators. This progressive process is essential to good drawing. If you are older than 10, or if you have finished this book and are ready for the next level, I recommend the Tezuka series 1 and 2 Animation books, if you are interested in animation or Christopher Hart's Anime Mania for more drawing techniques."
2,too kiddish,"in my opinion, this is too kiddish for anyone who wants to become serious. If you are a young (high elemntary are lower middle school) and are tying to start out with good instructions, i would sujust the books by katy coope, how to draw manga, and how th draw more manga."
4,Great for getting started!,"This book was great and I learned how to do a lot, but there are still many books to teach me stuff I don't know."
1,Not anime,"First of all it should be titled ""Kids draw Manga"" not ""Kids draw Anime"" because Anime and Manga are different and what this book teaches is considered as manga but anyway this wouldn't even be considered manga or anime because it's just way to bad and crappy. I mean don't even waste your time or money with this book, better yet go find it at your local library. I love to draw manga and anime and when I flipped through this book me and my friends, we were pissed off because it's an embarrassment. So not beginners or anyone above that. This is mainly for kids under the age of 7 or something."
1,a misnomer,"im sorry 4 those who like this book, and thats ok, but this name is a misnomer. this is not anime, but an american recreation of it called animerican. if u want real anime, may i suggest How to draw Anime and Game characters, vol. 1"
1,How To Draw....Well Crapy,"Hmm... lets see here, I saw this book lying around a friends house and after thumbing through it and came to the conclusion that this book teaches young children how to draw poor, disproportioned, unimaginative, trite, and frankly crapy manga or anime. I myself am an artist having taken Art AP for two years (this year is my second :P) and sold a number of pieces while still in high school so I do know what I am talking about. I paint realistic watercolors mostly (I love Alan Lee's art) but I do enjoying drawing manga let us face it, its fun. However, manga art can be extremely creative and individual if you just learn the basics and then let your own artistic skills and creativity developed a unique style. Books such as this one that put children in a box and teach them to draw cookie-cutter manga should be burned Fahrenheit 451 style. Instead, for the aspiring young cartoonist a broad guide likes how to Draw Manga vol.1 and let your mind run wild from there."
3,Could be better designed,"First, I'm happy to see a product made in the USA. However, the pen is pretty bulky because of the 2 AAA batteries it contains, and the very short ink refill doesn't hold as much ink as a regular pen (an extra refill is included). But do you need a lighted pen to do a lot of writing? Probably not, so a small refill is probably ok for most people.The incandescent bulb is actually brighter than it needs to be--it shines in all directions when all I need is a little light shining directly on the page so I can see what I'm writing. I don't need the whole page to be lit! A little LED lamp would be plenty, and only takes a tiny battery to operate.In short, it does the job, but it's a bit clunky and for my uses, too bright."
5,Great pen,"This pen is great for writing in the dark. As noted by the 2nd reviewer, putting the cap over the non-writing end keeps the light on. I've tried other pens that did not work as well."
5,"I'm in ""LOVE"" all over again!","More than just the best I've heard yet from Cherish The Ladies; even more than the best Celtic collection I've heard - this is music beyond genre. Music that works its way straight into your soul and then out to your fingers-drumming, toes-tapping.extremities! ""At Home"" displays the amazing musical alchemy of these fine musicians: blending musical brilliance into passion, joy, and excitement. Whew! Time to press PLAY again!"
5,The best so far!!!,"The latest offering from Joanie Madden and the girls of Cherish the Ladies is nothing short of brilliance. With a mix of poignant, thought provoking songs and beautiful arrangements that they have become famous for, this CD is definately the best that I have heard by far. There are traditional as well as original compositions included and the balance on the CD is perfect. Specifically, the vocals sung by Aoife Clancy are amazing. The clarity, breadth, and range in her voice are all evident on each of the tracks. The Curragh of Kildare, The Leader of the Band and John O Dreams are all masterfully arranged and presented. As one of CTL's biggest fans, I strongly recommend this CD for those who appreciate a mix of beautiful songs, and traditional/ original tunes."
4,great cd by a 15 year old,"mandy moore has some really great songs like ""candy"",""walk me home"",""not too young"",""so real"", and ""quit breaking my heart"",but the rest were not so great. i don't get why she put in ""telephone"" for anyway. it's not even a song and it's a few seconds long!"
2,Not impressed,"I bought this cd because of candy since that song is cool and all. I listened to the others on the album and theres only a few good ones. i was dissapointed. On the songs where the words and music are great, her voice is absolutely terrible-it sounds like she is trying to give out a voice that she doesn't have. ( Sorry Mandy, but ya gotta quit tryin' so hard. )"
4,A Really Good CD,"This CD is quite good. So Real, Candy (of course), What you Want, Walk me Home, Not to young, I Like it, and some others are the best. The one star I took off for are some of em sound identicle.And also a bonus, you get the Candy music video, and an Interview when u stick it in your computer. But besides some similar songs, this CD rocks, but before you buy it, I recomend Britney Spears CD cuz it all has its own toon."
1,Worser than the dirtiest of trash,Mandy Moore is a poor man's Britney Spears. She clearly rose to prominence in the music industry by shrewd record producers wishing to capitalize on the current pop tart craze (a la Britney Spears). This album is superfluous and asinine.
1,MANDY'S VOICE IS LIKE CANDY,"MANDY'S VOICE IS LIKE CANDY: IT MAKES YOU SICK AND ROTS YOUR TEETH! NO, SERIOUSLY, HER VOICE REALLY DID MAKE ME SICK. THE ONLY REASON WHY I BOUGHT THIS CD AT ALL IS BECAUSE I LIKED THE SONG CANDY. HER VOICE SOUNDS LIKE A WACKED-OUT VERSION OF BRITTANEY SPEARS, AND COMPARED TO WHAT SOME OTHER PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PUTTING ABOUT HER VOICE, THATS A COMPLIMENT! ALL HER SONGS HAVE REALLY DUMB LYRICS, EXAMPLE: I WANT YOU TO LOCK ME IN YOUR HEART AND THROW AWAY THE KEY, SHOW ME LOVE THE WAY ITS SUPPOSED TO BE. THIS GIRL'S ONLY FIFTEEN! LETS HOPE SHE'S ONLY THINKING ABOUT STUFF LIKE THIS!"
2,Not worth it,"Mandy sounds immature on all her love me for me songs on her debut album 'So Real'. I don't recommend this album, and her single 'Candy' is way over rated because she's trying so much to sound like a Britney hit. On ""What You Wants"", Mandy tries to deliver R&B, and yet she hasn't master the skill. Young artists like 15 year old Mandy need more vocal lessons because even Jennifer Love Hewitt's debut album was embarassingly better. I rather much recommend a female teen artist that parts from the Britney and Christina's bubble gum style, try Billie's debut album ""Honey To The B"". You don't know what your missing out on."
2,ok debut CD,"Edit: Looking back at what I wrote about this CD earlier, I wonder what kind of mood I was in. This CD is decent.Okay. I bought this CD because I liked ""Candy."" Most of the songs on this album are filler songs, as is typical of a debut CD, but ""So Real,"" and ""Love You for Always"" are really good.Overall, Mandy is a great singer. Her albums have gotten better and more enjoyable. Her third album, ""Mandy Moore,"" is my favorite. Check it out!"
1,"Another ""pretty"" pop star with no talent","If you've ever listened to Mandy Moore live and then listened to her CD, you can hear a huge difference. The voice on the CD is not Mandy's real voice, therefore she is not a real artist. The songs were good but I'll scream if I hear that voice one more time!"
2,I don't think so.....!,"...Anyway, I only liked two of the songs on this CD which areher singles: ""Candy"" and ""Walk Me Home"". The restof the songs on this CD however, all sucked...Most of the songs on SOREAL are pretty lame and rather embarrassing..Mandy reminds me of thatlame Girl-Group, Dream because the girls of Dream are like, the sameages as Mandy Moore. I really do hope you will reconsider buying thisalbum because it will be very disappointing. Now, if you like thesongs, ""Candy"" and ""Walk Me Home"", then Irecommend the singles for those two songs. Otherwise, don't botherbuying SO REAL...If you wanna buy music by one of the teen ""PopPrincess"", then I suggest going with CDs by the talents ofChristina Aguilera and Jessica Simpson.Bottom Line: A realdisappointment and a waste of money."
1,What are you thinking?,"How is there any way that you people can say that any of these girls (Brittney, Christina, Jessica, Mandy) are ""pop divas?"" These girls are all show and no talent; Mandy Moore is what, 11 years old? She looks and sounds like she hasn't even hit puberty. Her voice is no different from any of these talentless girls. Actually, Christina can actually belt out those songs of hers, but she still shouldn't be considered a ""diva."" These girls aren't even old enough to vote, let alone be ""divas."" Get over Mandy Moore; she's going to be quickly forgotten."
1,Where has all the talent gone?,"Listening to this CD, I was astounded at the lack of talent Mandy had. Her voice is just plain awful! and her attitude on her videos is so phony and SO-UNREAL. The tracks on the CD lack the punch of Britney and Christina and Jessica, and her voice is by far the worst of any artist I've heard. I don't know how on earth she got to become a performer, cause she lacks any ounce of talent for singing. Mandy, maybe you should model, but your singing career is the joke of the year."
1,Horrible!,"I hope Mandy Moore reads this one day.Now, this is my opinion and I am entitled to it aight?Mandy Moore lacks much vocal talent and I am surprised she made it, especially on Sony. Mandy, you are lucky to have that record company, I know more than 200,000,000 other people that are more talented that you and your album. Your voice is annoying sometimes and I think you DO have fans that WILL support you, but the rest of the people just think your voice, your talents are minimal! I know this may hurt your feelings but I STILL CANNOT believe you made it! I think maybe some of the material weren't for your voice and it wasn't right! Sorry! But your album is horrible, I am not saying you should be a Christina Aguilera or a Mariah Carey but go home!"
1,give me a break,This is terrible. Moore is to Korn as Spears is to Limp Bizkit. I tell you...the people who deserve respect are the recording engineers who turn this into gold.
2,Mandy,"I am so glad that Mandy is getting out of the poppish music. It is so plain, and we already know the beat. So no surpirse to this cd."
2,"Why, Mandy, WHY?","Okay, so I liked Mandy's style and I thought she was cute, so I bought this album. Lets' just say it was totally dissapointing. All of the songs are sugary-sweet pop and there is not one that doesn't mention the words ""i love you"", or something similar. The only good thing is the great pictures of Mandy inside. Why not check out Britney Spears' ""Baby, One More Time"", or Christina Aguilera's ""Christina Aguilera"" if you want a real sophomore album!So Real-2/5Candy-1/5What You Want-5/5Walk me Home-3/5Lock me in Your Heart-5/5Telephone (Interlude)-4/5Quit Breaking my Heart-2/5Let Me be the One-3/5Not too Young-1/5Love Shot-5/5I Like it-1/5Love Yu for Always-2/5Quit Breaking my Heart (reprise)-1/5AVERAGE RATING-2/5"
2,An OK CD,"The only really good song here is ""Lock Me in Your Heart"". Some other songs are all right, but none of the other ones are really too great."
5,THIS CD ROX! It's tHe PerFeCt PreSENt! :C,"Ok, you're here lookin 4 the perfect present for someone...or maybe even yourself. Well, to make life easy for you, your search endz here. Get the Mandy Moore cd with the hugggeeee hit, ""Candy"" on it, and life will neva be the same! Have you eva seen the ""Candy""video wit da MAD hot guy at that diner? Well, you should try to see it, and definitley get this cd~"
1,DEJA VU? (ROBYN),"When I first heard ""Candy"" on the radio, I TRULY thought it was Robyn (the sadly forgotten Swedish singer) pouring her heart out! However, when I heard it was some other girl named ""Mandy Moore?"" I was completely disgusted! Then when I heard it again, I could finally hear the difference...and the conclusion is Mandy Moore does have an OK voice for a 15 year old. However, she needs to distinguish herself by not trying too hard to sound deep and contrived (like Christina Aguilera). I am sorry to say that she is not worth the money folks...save it for a rainy day."
1,no,"Ok, what does this little girl know about love? Her CD came out when she was 14, which means she created it at age 13. What could a 13 year-old possibly know about love?"
2,Mandy seems cool but not cool enough for this album!,"Mandy seems really cool and nice and all from all the interviews and stuff. She's someone that you'll be great friends with and you can't be shy around her but when it comes to singing, I think she's a bit too young for it. Don't get me wrong- the songs on the album are awesome but she's only 15, so her voice is a bit weak. We'll have to see in about a couple years to see if she's good enough for this album. Someone with a stronger set of pipes like Jessica Simpson or Christina Aguilera will do better. It'll be a great gift for a friend and good for playing for parties but it won't be something that'll be on the charts for long. Mandy should come back in a year or two."
1,Uggg!,I got this CD for my birthday and I was so excited to listen to it. When all of my guests left i put it on. I listened to every song on it and was in tears after it was over. I hated it so much. I couldn't stand it. All it sounded like was really bad singing that still sounded bad after tons and tons of computer enhancement. BIG PUBLICITY STUNT! She thinks that she will become big like Mariah Carey or someone. I am asking please do not get this CD. You will regret it. I took it back that night and got another CD. I ask you again please do not buy this CD.
3,Not bad,"no prob with voice, songs are okay. Sorry to all Mandy fans but she says that she acts her age, great okay, so why does she look like she's an 18 yr old brittney spears? She can look 15, ive seen her on mags...so why?"
1,can I give it a 0 star?,Just 1 advice to all you teeny bop fans out there: Save your money! It's a waste to spend your allowance money on bad music.
2,Not too hot.,"Well, first it's important to remember that even though this CD is not so good, Mandy came back later with two new CDs and proved that she could do better. But this CD:Is really just not good. She was fourteen when she recorded some of these songs and it really shows, in fact it more than shows 'cause there are time when she sounds even younger. The songs couldn't be more generic, nothing funky, different, daring...no, these words didn't exist to whoever it was that produced these worn-out tracks.I don't hate it, but if you were to listen to something like Cry (which can be found on her third and newest album, Mandy Moore) and than listen to something like Lock Me in Your Heart (the fifth track on this CD). The better song would be painfully obvious.If you have her other two CDs than it's not completely pointless to buy this. But, if you're just looking for a Mandy Moore CD pick another one."
5,Mandy's Voice Is As Sweet As Candy,So Real - 8/10Candy - 9/10What You Want - 7/10Walk Me Home - 10/10Lock Me Heart - 9/10Telephone (Interlude) - this ain't a songQuit Breaking My Heart - 10/10 - BEST SongLet Me Be THe One - 10/10Not Too Young - 10/10Love Shot - 7/10I Like It - 8/10Love You For Always - 10/10Quit Breaking My Heart (Reprise) - 5/10
3,Last of the 1999 female pop singing sensation,"In 1998, teen queen Britney Spears hit the charts. Following behind in '99 were rivals Christina Aguilera, Jessica Simpson and...finally...Mandy Moore. The youngest of the four powerhouses, Miss Moore is the only one of them all who didn't make it to No. 1 at all with any of her debut's singles (which, basically, covered only ""Candy"" on that record). Mandy Moore's So Real is a worthwhile, though not nearly as cool as Brit's, Christina's or Jessica's debuts. 3 out of 5 stars for So Real."
2,Pop Queen's Debut Falls Flat,"I really never liked this album. I got it last year, and I just never really got into it.1. So Real- I think this was the first single. This is a pretty good song actually. 8/102. Candy-2nd single? I hate it. 3/103.What You Want- What was she thinking? 4/104.Walk Me Home- This is a pretty decent song.... 9/105.Lock Me In Your Heart- COOL! 10/106. Telephone (interlude)- I hate interludes, you jsut wanted to make the album look bigger didn't you? 1/107. Quit Breaking My Heart- This is sweet-9/108. Let Me Be The One- Ick 5/109. Not Too Young- Used to be good, now I don't really like it. 6/1010. Love Shot- Another goodie. 9/1011. I Like It- It's ok 6/1012. Love You For Always- Awfuul 1/1013. Quit Breaking My Heart )reprise)- I think, again, she wanted to make the album look bigger, but this is a good song, so 8/10I think it's about 80/130........2 stars"
2,"Weak voice, weak songs","I'm under the assumption that all the reviews saying ""Mandy is better than Britney. . . she's such a great singer"" were written by teenaged bubblegum blowers who don't know the difference between talent and studio hype. I'm sorry, but neither Britney Spears or Mandy Moore are particularly talented, nor are their songs particularly memorable. After having listened to this CD, I truly would like to know what all the hype is about. This girl has an average voice, and her songs are just plain cheesy and stupid."
1,Worse than Britney Spears...and that's saying something!,"Ugh! This girl makes Britney Spears sound like Mariah Carey. Her voice is HORRIBLE. Still, the teenies love it, I guess. As said on MTV.com, ""Critiqing Mandy Moore is a little like critiquing the weather. It's something that HAS to happen, like it or not."" Could not have said it better myself. Why junk like this sells is beyond me. All it is really is a childish, little-girl voice singing along to stupid tunes with even stupider lyrics. ""I'm missin you like candy""? What's that all about? If you want young female pop singers who can SING, I reccomend Jessica Simpson and Christina Aguilera."
1,cloned...again,"What is the music industry coming to? The pop industry has mutated into some sort of machine churning out cloned teenaged girls, each able to smile seductively and look good in Tommy Hilfiger. And unfortunately for Mandy, that's about all she can do. Unlike Spears, Moore cannot dance as evidenced by her video ""Candy"". And unlike her powerful vocal counterparts Christina Aguilera and Jessica Simpson, Moore sounds tinny and weak. Her tender age is most likely a factor in her vocal weakness, however, she can barely even manage emoting on her hit pop ditty ""Candy"". If she can barely manage fluff, I doubt she can manage anything the likes of Houston or Carey."
2,Kind of Annoying,This CD is kind of annoying because her voice is not good at all. She sounds way better on her later albums than on this one. Her voice is very whiny here. The lyrics are also nothing special. This is just like any other pop album of the time but with a worse voice than some.
5,Awesome!,"So this product is greatness. The CD itself and the casing is in prime condition, the CD plays all songs without any sort of interference, the item was shipped and was earlier than i had expected. Its an awesome product and i thankyou for having it on sale!"
1,Just another pop princess wannabe...,"And they say the BOY pop market is bad. I love pop, especially 'boy bands' (except BoyZone, 5ive, and this other one they're all OK) it just has to have a bit of an edge. Britney Spears is the only (and Janet Jackson) really talented girl singer out there. Christina Augruleria is just... um... a Britney wanna be. 3LW just needs to leave. They sound like little whiny babies.And now... mandy Moore. A girl singing about stuff she'll never expiereince because she's going to be chased around my thousands of harmonial boys screaming about the size of her chest. And she can't sing. My sisters have both 3LW and Mandy Moore's CD's, unfortanutately; and I have to listent o them. The only decent song is I Wanna Be With You and I think I was only attracted ti the title because of the BSb did a song called I Wanna Be With You but it was completely different and upbeat. (Thank god)"
3,Sweet and Sour Candy,"Overall, this CD was just OK. Most of her vocals sounded as if she were whining or rolling her ""r""s. ""So Real"", the title track is good to listen and dance to. Songs like ""Let Me Be The One"" and ""Candy"" are downright bad. ""Not Too Young""'s lyrics (I'm not too young to know the right thing to do/And one of those things is not to fall for you) were very well written. If you love singers like Britney Spears, buy this CD. I wouldn't highly reccomend So Real."
1,Yawn,"Oh lord I thought this would be a good CD,but I was wrong. Mandy has a bad voice and nasty song writers. I don't know what people was thinking when they thought this was ready for the public. I paid for this and I am not happy. Now I have to use this to hold up my dining room table."
1,A new routine pop singer,I just listened to the whole entire CD and I am very disappointed. I tried not to listen to bad reviews because I wanted to judge for myself. But they were right. This CD is not all it's hyped up to be. Her voice is nasally and airy. Mandy has no vocal range and her songs have no meaning. Maybe her next album will be better because Epic made a mistake with this one. I think her voice is studio-made and her dancing is bad 9she just can't do it like Britney). Please do not waste your money on this CD. Buy Christina Aguliera's CD. Her voice is naturally beautiful and her songs have meaning and truth.
3,She is all most there!,"Mandy Moore is a good singer, kind of, her only good song is Candy.Candy is a really good song but the rest of them are not that great! She needs to put her heart and soul into it!She makes it seem to easy! She isn't trying very hard at all and it shows! I am a fan of only 1 song, Candy, but I hope she gets ""Moore"" better songs so I can be a fan of her too!"
3,Too young,This album is okay but it is hard to buy that a fifteen year old can relate to all of the love songs that she sings. Mandy even admitted that she does not understand most of her songs due to no boyfriends yet. However Candy is a good fast song and the next three songs are good songs. I do not listen to the rest of the album. If you are buying the cd just for Candy than I recommend you buy a single if you can find one. It is an okay debut album but she needs to grow a lot as an artist.
4,Hey! what is with all the negative reviews!,Hey! how come everyone is sending the dumbest reviews i've seen in my life. I liked the CD very much and for 15 that is how all girls her age should sound. So I say that everyone stops dissing her I think that she should be congradulated for what she's done. I don't think you should be sending mean reviews. I think you should Send it to the one you like instead of dissing other artists. They give it all they've got to get this far. So send it to a artist you like if thats ok. Thank you and this cd is the bomb!
2,not bad,"For a new artist like Mandy Moore, this CD is okay but slightly dissapointing. The songs individually sound nice, but the themes are generally the same : like like like and love love love... In addition, the texture of her voice sounds the same in all tracks, like one song repeated over and over. And the album does get really boring after awhile. I initially bought this CD because I was in love with the song ""Candy"" when I heard it on TRL. However it's unneccessary to buy the entire CD when there're more worthy places to spend the money, namely Britney Spears's ""Baby One More Time"" and Christina Aguilera's self-titled album. These two artists' voices do not sound as shallow as Mandy Moore's. Thanks for listening."
1,nope.,"Mandy Moore cannot sing. She whines her way through the album in a very Britneyesque fashion and it hurts to listen to just one song. I've heard her live and on the cd, and in both cases I have been blown away by the LACK of talent in this girl. She must have some pretty good connections to the music industry if she's come this far doing so badly. Go listen to Christina Aguilera or Jessica Simpson if you want to listen to talent. This cd will be stashed right above the Britney Spears album--in my trashcan."
1,We got another one!,"Yes, we got another pretty pop princess. Only she's...no wait, Mandy Moore is exactly like every other teen star that's out there now. The songs show no signs of orignality, and her voice is less than stellar. If you like these foumulatic singers like Britney and Christina and Jessica, you'll probably like Mandy."
2,yea yea yea we've heard this before,"We've heard it before. Can we say Britney Spears 3 years younger? I am the same age as Mandy, and I just can't believe she has had this much publicity...Most of the songs sound the same, and Mandy has NO range in her vocals. She sings all her songs in a VERY high soprano voice, and it almost hurts your ears. I swear. Mandy should stay in school rather than pursue this 'singing' career, cuz judging from her interviews, there's not much up there. She's just another pretty face. If you are in the mood to hear some young female talent, may I suggest Christina Aguilera or Jessica Simpson. Now those girls can sing, and they don't say 'like' and 'um' every other word."
4,Angelic Voices,"Mandy has a smooth angelic voice like Charlotte Church whereas Britney is somewhat harsher/sharper. Easy to listen to as background or totally immersed. The album features great harmonies without too much multi/over tracking. A few songs are somewhat fashionably abrasive (thank Brit). But as a whole, it's great."
4,Solid,"I have just listened to Brittany and Jessica and gues who I like the best? This lady can sing--she may not have yet found her own style, but the music is pleasant to listen to... an upbeat experience. The background music is exceptional."
3,Okay Debut,"I got this cd because ""Candy"" was one of those songs that just stuck in your head. There is a lot of age appropriate material here. Mandy isn't talking about last night, she is talking about forever. The songs seem to be about everything young teenagers think about, Princes, love forever and happiness. On one down note some songs are just too sugary-sweet and pack too much little girl for a 15 year old. Mandy's voice does faulter a little and doesn't seem as strong as Jessica's or Christina's, but she can hold her own. It is a fine album for a start."
1,"Mommy, Please Make It Stop!","I don't know if I can stand another teen pop star on the already overloaded market. No, wait a minute, I can't! I am not capable of stomaching another artificial singer who doesn't write her/his own songs, has the producers making machine-based and heartless ""music"" for them, and then ends up with a multi-platinum album. It's lightweight pop by a teenage girl who happens to sing just like Robyn.(Remember her, no?) It's about time that we, the intelligent teenagers out there, started buying albums by musicians that make music that will actually last more than 5 months, like Tram, Daft Punk, or Vast (if radio would play them). At least the 80's pop scene had Depeche Mode & New Order.But other than that, the album's fanastic."
2,Hmmm.,"I must say, Mandy Moore is a half decent singer, but we do have better vocalists here in France. Here, not all singers are blond carbon copies of each others. Just a note."
1,Mandy will be forgotten in about 2 months,"It is the year 2015, and me and my son are at a garage sale. He finds this CD in a bin of old CD's and asks me ""who was Mandy Moore?"" I say ""Well son, she had one song back in the day, and I can't remember how it goes because she was very forgettable and dull. I can't imagine how bad the rest of the songs are on that CD!"" My son then asks me ""It is only a dollar, can I buy it anyway just for fun"" and i say ""well, it is definitely not worht a dollar, but it will come out of your allowance!"""
2,Mandy's Cd,"This is one of those one hit wonders. It's one of those cd's that you'll find in the thrift store 10 years later. Maybe if Mandy and her manager and whoever else worked on this cd would have put a little more effort in I would be giving this cd 4 or 5 stars. Unfortunatly, They didn't. My favorite song was Candy(although her voice was digitally remastered and all it was good!) My advice for you is to listen to the samples and find out whether it's good for you. If it isn't good try out Christina Aguilera or Jessica Simpson. If you didn't like it you won't like Briteny Spears so don't even think of getting that!"
1,A very unoriginal and dissapionting album,"When I bought So Real, I debated between it and a few other albums like Macy Gray's and a few others. Foe some reason, I chose Mandy's and I really regreted it. It was a big disappointment, and I said ""Why couldn't I have bought Macy Gray's CD"". You see, Mandy's album followed the same routine as every other sucessful girl singer, and Macy Gray's was really original and each song was carefully thought out and made. I think Mandy is doing so poorly as a singer is because her songs are unoriginal and uncreative. Briitney and Christina already have really good pop songs and stuff, so why listen to Mandy's not-so-good pop songs? I don't know reall, but all I can tell you is that this album is uncreative, and the songs just don't do it for me."
1,Just Junk,"Well, this album totally pales in comparison to either of Britney Spears' works. It is just trash. That ""Candy"" song is annoying and stupid. I mean, hello! She's telling a guy she'll love him forever when she's 15! Doesn't this seem wrong to anyone else? ...This album is [bad] and you won't be sorry you avoided it."
1,"with so many awesome cd's out there, why buy this one","there are so many really good artists out there with really good albums, and Mandy's is just plain boring and bad. you might not value my opinion very much cause i'm just a kid with experience as a critic. well, real music critics have also hated this album. entertainment magazine gave it a C-, and I can assur you that it is true (check if you want to). cdnow.com also gave a bad review to Mandy and her singing ability. So even the experts agree with me that this cd isn't worth it....at all."
1,Mandy Moore is the disgrace of the pop world,"You heard it right, this album just plain bites. Every song on this album is just ""stuffing"", which is a really bad song that they think up in one minute to put between the good songs. Well, every song is stuffing in this album. When I first played through the CD, I kept waiting for a really good single to pop out at me (besides Candy), and before I knew it, the CD was over. Not a single song caught my ear, they we're REALLY REALLY LAME AND BORING. Sorry Mandy, but your debut CD is the disgrace of the pop era!"
1,"I'm sorry, but this CD was awful","Besides Candy, every song on this CD was horrible. They rushed too fast produce this CD, and you shouldn't buy it. And on top of how bad and uncatchy each song is, mandy has such a horrible voice. Bad, Bad CD, and such a bad voice."
1,REALLY REALLY BITES!!!,OMG I can't stand this girl. I really don't know why either! Just something about her and her songs that just bug the hell outta me! Thats just my opinion.
2,Drivel,"By Mandy Moore's own admission, this was a poor album. A few of the singles are catchy, so save your money and buy them instead of the entire album."
2,Manufactured...to the Max,"Sorry Mandy, but I really didn't like this CD. It was her first, and her CD's have definitely gotten better as her career progresses, but ""So Real""'s sound definitely didn't come across as very real to me! It was a very manufactured-sounding CD. ""Candy"" was a pretty good song, and I liked ""What You Want"" a lot, but the rest of the songs either didn't have a good beat to them or the lyrics were less than memorable.If you haven't already purchased this CD, I would say skip it and buy Mandy's new album instead. You'll get a lot better music for your money."
3,Mandy Moore-The next Britney clone?,"It's obvious that Mandy got her inspiration from Britney. But she comes through it with a lot more spunk, style and freshness. The best songs on this CD are ""Not Too Young,"" ""Love Shot,"" and ""So Real."" They show the most originality, but retain their soft pop sounds. This is really a pretty good CD, but it lost points with me because the girl herself tries too hard. If you're into Britney, listen to ""Candy"" ""Walk Me Home"" or ""Quit Breakin My Heart."" But if you just want something new and different but still pop, try the ones I mentioned before. Don't let the three stars throw you-some of these tracks are A-list."
1,I'm scared to see what's coming out next.....,"Okay,you have got to be kidding! What's next? Sparky the singing spaniel? I bet he'll have more talent then this new generation of ""no talent"" powderpuffs. Britney, Jessica, and Mandy? The record industry has this blonde motif going on and I hope that Mandy Moore is the last of them. I have an excellent ear for music and I'm sorry but these girls are singing the blues....on a sour note......EEEEEEEEk!"
1,Fizzless soda pop,"Mandy Moore's CD lacks the soda pop quality that Britney Spears and Christina A. Mandy's ""Candy"" is fun to listen to but her range is limited and her voice quality is that of a karaoke stylest. She lacks the luster and pizzaz that Britney and Christina have. ""Candy"" is the only song on this album that makes you want to tap a foot and could possible keep up awake. This CD is one that you can pass up. Save your money and save our ears!"
1,"Another overrated, talentless attempt to make money","When I first heard this CD, my first thoughts were, ""What is this?"" It was anything but pleasing to my ears and I was extremely happy when it was done. This CD contains nothing more than manufactured songs that aren't sung very well, if in fact you can call that singing. I'll admit she does have some talent, but not enough to be able to have an album and sell it. People just got caught up in the hype and bought this album. My advice is not to buy this album and save your money for some girls who can really sing, like Christina, Jessica, or Britney."
2,"Rather typical, isn't it?","Sometimes, you get tired of a few things. For me, teen-pop is going overboard and this proves the case with Mandy moore's latest CD. Its doesn't quite miss but it doesn't quite hit either. The material is rather typical and some songs seems and sound too similar. She has a somewhat vague potential but this will never work out into anything if only she varies her music. The album isn't quite that bad but it isn't terribly good either"
3,just like candy,she has a weird voice whitch can be cool her voice sometimes gets annoying but it's a nice voice for a 15 year old
3,Why 3 stars?,"Well, some of the reviews were real critising of Mandy, so I thought I'd put in my review. I agree with the rest that Mandy does really act old. I thought she was 18 when I first heard of her. But... we've gotta give her some credit for Walk Me Home,Candy,What you want.They are nice,especially Walk Me Home.But For Some songs She Just Doesn't seem to be singing as if she's in that kind of mood,so 2 stars go down the drain. I originally gave her 5 stars , but after listening to the samples, I don't think she deserves them."
1,"If you like bad music and superficial singers, this is 4 U!","Mandy Moore's songs aren't good. I frankly have no respect for her at all, the way she dresses is just one of the reasons. PLUS, all the girl does is dance and lip sync! I mean, can you call that talent! If her songs were OKAY sounding, then MAYBE you could overlook the lack of orginality of the whole CD, but they aren't! It's just fake, and she keeps on adding this fake emphasis to her voice which is not cool. But hey, if you like superficial musicians, knock yourself out."
1,I've heard better voices on Kareoke night!,"Please, please, please save your money on this one. Mandy Moore is a no talent waste. She gets by completely on her looks alone. I rate this album ""0"" stars if that is possible. She should spend more time with school work and to make her self better so some day when she needs to earn a living doing something productive she has the skills."
1,sick and wrong,todays world is sad where a singer with no talent can use her looks and use her record company to hype it up till you see her on every MTV special. the songs have no meanings to them they leave no message and have no point. people who buy this cd need to figure out that what mtv says is not always true and that there is other music in the world that is not played on that channel.
1,"This isn't music, it is noise!","Mandy Moore has no TRUE talent. I consider this a fact, not an opinion. All you have to do is compare her with others. She has no range (fact) because she can't go both high and low with the same strength of voice. The voice itself is nasal. She might as well be holding her nose. I just can't say enough to express how annoying it is that someone with so little talent can succeed in such a large business. She'd better enjoy it while it lasts."
1,I tried to give it a chance... I really did,"I bought Mandy's disc last week. I wanted to find out if she really was as good or bad as people made her out to be. I was sorely disappointed in this cd. Her voice lacks any depth and it seems her back up singers do most of the actual singing. After listening to the first three tracks, I thought the cd might be somewhat decent in terms of song writing, but ""Quit Breking My Heart"" and the corny ""Telephone(Interlude)"" proved me wrong. Perhaps the disc could have been better if Mandy's singing voice would have been better. It relies on canned beats and synthesizers to do most of the work. Overall, I would not recommend buying this cd if you are looking for a mature listening experience or even a singer with talent."
5,This Is Not Just A Normal CD!,"Usually When I Hear About A New CD Coming Out Of Someones, Usually I Think There Is Probably Only One Or Two Good Songs On The CD And The Other Stuff Is Awful. But On So Real, All Of The Songs Are Great. They've Got Something In Them That Keeps You Wanting More. All Of The Songs Have A Good Beat And She's Got A Great Voice. Along With The Great Voice She Is Quite Attractive Also. It's Also An Enhanced CD. So You Can Watch Her Video For Candy On Your Computer At Anytime If You Buy It! There's Also A Great Interview With Her! It's A Great CD And I Think You Should Buy It. It's Worth It!"
3,It's OK.,"I think Mandy Moore is ok. She has an ok voice for her age. She can dance fairly well, and the tunes are catchy, but she really doesn't have all that much talent. I'm a person who loves Britney, so I guess that's not a very good remark on my part.If you want to listen to some catchy, happy tunes, then this cd is for you."
5,"For a debut, its nice","Some of you really are too harsh. On any artist's debut album, they have very little influence over what is put out. The executives and industry ""experts"" decide almost everything and try to manipulate the artist into something that will sell, not what the artist wants to do.In light of this, I decided to judge more on style than overall music. Her voice is nice, she doesn't need studio editing to help grasp a clear tone. Most of the songs on here are upbeat, and therefore her voice is kind of pushed into the background. This isn't exactly Mandy's fault, more the producer's fault. If you've ever heard her sing live, then you'd know that she has a beautiful voice."
5,"Fun, Funky, and Cool","Mandy Moore's album includes fun, cool, dance music for anyone, anywhere, at any time. The fast songs are great to dance to and sing along with, the slow ones are also sweet to listen to. The lyrics are well written, and the music is, well, just great! If you're into the pop scene these days, like Britney, Christina, or Jessica, I suggest you get this. If not, you'll probably still like it!"
2,where do i start....,"Mandy, Mandy, Mandy. I'd say don't quit your day job, but you're not even the legal age to work. Her voice is obviously undeveloped, either that or she just sings really, really bad. The songs on this cd are either a) boring b) annoying c) almost completely computerized or d) all of the above. The whole time I listened to ""So Real"" I found myself wishing ""Baby One More Time"" was in my discman, and that really says a lot.I don't blame her for trying to cash in on the success of other girl pop acts, but this cd is NOT worth your money. Buy the candy single, and the one for ""Walk Me Home"" too- let's just leave it at that, 'kay?"
5,WHAT EVER POP FAN WANTS,"MANDY MOORE'S DEBUT ALBUM ""SO REAL"" IS 100% GREAT.WITH THE TOP 40 HIT ""CANDY"" AND HER NEXT SINGLE ""WALK ME HOME"" AND OTHER HITS LIKE ""WHAT YOU WANT"", ""SO REAL"" AND ""LOCK ME IN YOUR HEART"". THIS SHOULD OF DEBUT ON THE CHARTS AT #1,NOT #77."
4,Pretty good,"As someone the exact same age as Mandy, I have to say she is not only good for someone her age, but good as in terms of all the new female pop singers out there. Her attutude in interviews could use some work (she is coming off as another Britney...heaven help us) but other than that, I think she has a promising future in the music industry. In my opinion, the best song is ""What You Want."" It has a sassy feel to it. I can see why the first single was ""Candy,"" however. It is clearly the most upbeat and has the catchiest hook out of all the songs. I hope Mandy goes far with her career, and I am looking forward to seeing more of her songs hit the airwaves."
4,HI,"this cd is ok. I think that if she considers her self a REAL pop star, she should have a LOT MORE FAST, CATCHY, DAnce tunes"
2,Teen Hype,"Candy sounds catchy but it has too close a resemblance to Robyn's Show Me Love. The overall album is so-so, and definitely forgettable. The album doesn't sound original or distinctive. Moreover, she's only 15. THIS HAS GOT TO STOP! Singing and performing a teen girl's way to wealth and popularity, who doesn't possess REAL singing talent, doesn't serve a positive model for teenagers out there. It's sabotaging the quality of music entertainment."
1,"Mandy should be seen, not heard","OK, I admit that Mandy is pretty good-looking, but her voice, for lack of a better word, was hidious. She is just a face, and I expect her career to end after Candy is retired from TRL. Mandy, if you're reading this, stay in school and forget this joke of a singing career. We'll all forget your name in a month or so."
2,Needs Some Work!,"Mandy Moore has a good voice and personally I like the song Candy but the rest of them are to muck like all other songs. Mandy Moore is to much like to others Britaney Spears, Christina etc. The other thing is she is WAY to young. If you want the same old same old this CD is good for you. But if you want some vatity keep shoping!"
1,Want good stuff? or this trash?,This stuff is trash that is only git for cannibalistic egotistical brats! get some good music and style before this kills you!
3,Average,"I like the song ""Candy"" but I'm giving the CD an average rating because it's not original enough. Sounds too much like Robyn. Remember Robyn? She appeared on the scene two years ago with the hit songs ""Show me Love"" and ""Do you know (What it Takes)."" Candy sounds like these two Robyn songs mixed together."
1,Mandy is a waste of your money,"Why oh why did I decide to but Mandy Moore's ""So Real"". It was the most boring and uncreative piece of trash I have ever bought. Hardly any of the songs caught my attention. The whole rest of the album was the most boring and stupid music I ever did hear (listen to Telephone(Interlude) and you'll know what I mean. Mandy needs to find a new line of work, casue she's a bad performer."
5,~*Mandy More's CD is SO REAL!*~,"Mandy Moore is extraordinary. If you're thinking of buying this CD- stop thinking and do it. It is one of my very favorite CD's in my extensive collection, and is always in my CD player! Teens can really relate to it, none of the unrealistic stuff Britney and Jessica sing about. Mandy Moore all the way! This CD is keepin it real... or should i say keeping it So Real?"
3,Another Waste Of Incredible Talent,"What the hell is wrong with the Music Industry these days? We've got Britney Spears who has no talent at all singing some decent? songs and then we have talented vocalists like Mandy Moore and Christina Aguilera who aren't getting much to work with. Mandy Moore's ""So Real"" has it's higlights but the album as a whole isn't all that good. ""Candy"" is a good Pop song that deserved more radio airplay than it got (Thank-You Britney). and the only other song that actually stands out is ""I Wanna Be With You"" which is an amazing ballad. Mandy Moore herself is a very talented vocalist and deserves a lot more credit. If you like ""Candy"" and ""I Wanna Be With You"" then don't get this album but go and get her second album ""I Wanna Be With You"". It'll be a much better investment."
4,Awesome!,"This cd was good. It would have gotten 5 stars but there weresome very bad songs. I did like these songs though:CandySoRealNot Too Young (My absolute fav)Walk Me HomeAll the other songs were ok, except for two that turned my stomach:Love ShotI Like ItAwful. Anyway, this cd was good overall. (edit)"
1,Mandy Moore can't sing,"At first when I heard Mandy Moore sing I was like not bad! Then I saw her at the MTV Snowed in thing,and she was awful!She must be lip singing in that video ""Candy"" because her live performance was pitiful. Her back up singers took over and she was choking on every other word. When she tries to sing with so called ""soul"" her face scruches up and she looks like a prune or someone who can't sing who is trying to get a good sound out using all her strength. Don't be fooled by her lip singing videos people. They need to give her back up singers a album instead of her."
5,Great CD,I bought this CD a week or two ago and haven't stoped listening to it since. I think she has talent and she will make a great impression on pop music fans everywhere. I really recommend it.
1,HORRRRRRRRIIIIIIBLLLLEEEEE,"this cd is soooo bad, i like her knew song wanna be with you. THATS 1 song that she has made. thats pathetic. my cat can sing better then her..."
1,Bitter Sweet Failure,"I agree with the girl who wanted to put the CD in her microwave! This CD is more fun destroying then listening to people you gotta trust me on this one! Her voice is uncomparable to Christina Aguilera and other great artists, and the tune can only really be enjoyed by people not yet in middle school! Two words.....Buy Macy Gray!!! If you're reading this, sorry Mandy. Look into a career alternative! McDonalds is hiring!!! :o)"
1,So Real was very disappointing,"When Candy first came out, I had very high hopes for Mandy, and I decided to buy her cd. I have to say that it was very disappointing. I really wish that more work had been put into the songs, and I wish Mandy had taken just a few more voice lessons. I like Mandy, but unfortunately her cd is now stuffed away somewhere and I doubt I'll ever listen to it again. If you are planning on buying So Real, I suggest you save your money for Jessica Simpson or Macy Gray. They both have really great voices and a lot of effort was put into their songs (unlike Mandy's). I am sorry to give only one star, but I really feel that So Real could have been made a lot better."
1,"Ugh, not another one....","I cannot not like an album consisting of the word heart in 3 different tracks in one time, it shows unoriginality and that's what this is. It's bad enough we have Britney and Britney Ver. 2.0, we don't need another one."
1,Mandy gives pop a bad name.,"Many people make fun of pop divas for having bad voices and pretty faces, but I think Britnry and Christina have exellent voices and deserve more credit. Mandy, on the other hand, gives pop a bad name. Her shrill, disgusting voice adds to the stereoetype that pop divas cannot sing. She really has little to no talent. The songwriting is very bad on her CD. After track 2, the CD pretty much bites, and there are absolutely no other good singles she has to build her career on. Mandy: your CD and your voice are a sick, sick joke."
2,What happened? How did it get derailed?,"Dark, gritty, bloody, with sex scenes and torture. Not a very nice film. Which is kind of weird to say about a series of movies filled with death and sword-fighting. But this movie misses any humor - it is as serious as you can get and not become something from PBS.Zatoichi causes the death of a woman by accident and has to find her daughter to try to...well, do what? Ask forgiveness? Make up for her mother's death? This is Zatoichi in the gutter and something that really makes you wonder how the character can even live with himself after aall the events.The film work itself, and the acting, is very good - it is just the subject and plot that makes the viewer feel unclean."
2,Not too Stable,"Unfortunately, the base is not very stable, and you can only use the magnetic letters that go with it. Very limiting."
3,"For loft living enthusiasts, this is your pictorial book. .","This book focuses on the architectural realm of the loft apartment. Unfortunately it does not contain many pictures of different lofts that are lived in. Instead it focuses on the architectural design, which is quite interesting if you own or are interested in this living environment."
3,Not wonderful but not bad either...,"It doesnt set the standards for manga, ok.The story is basically about Zero- this guy who is half god, half demon and is the person who comes to lead the souls to the underworld when you die. Its a good story, an interesting story but regrettable you cant really tell the differnece between the males and females because they all look like girls."
3,significant limitations,"This book came to me with excellent references and I was eager to dive in. I found the book easy to read, and provides a good introduction. It is probably appropriate if you are doing some basic work with an existing database. However I had significant issues:- many of the examples assume you are using Sybase and won't work on other systems. This bias may come from the tied with Sybase; the book comes with a Sybase CD and two of the authors are from Sybase.- Attempts are made to point out differences between the various systems, however they seem to have been quickly added to allow for a fourth edition. The added text breaks the flow and adds confusion.- It lacks the depth for building a database or complex work."
5,"Great depth of content, easy reading, not overboard but everything you need!","The best SQL book I've found so far. This is really just an update of ""The Practical SQL Handbook"" and that's a good thing. These authors do a marvelous job of explaining how to accomplish things with SQL without getting too deep. The writing is at a conversational level ... like you are speaking with a co-worker.I think the organization of the book makes sense and have had no problems finding answers while jumping around the chapters.This book has been around for many years (This is the fourth edition) and I can understand why. It is probably all you will ever need.I also bought ""SQL Queries for Mere Mortals"". I haven't spent much time with it yet but it seems to be more a textbook to ""rev up your SQL with hot licks"" in its approach and not as much of a general purpose book like the ""Practical SQL Handbook"". I think the two of them cover my needs completely."
1,"This isn't a text book, it's an indoctrination -- and full of mistakes too!","Even though I agree with many of the opinions that Boyes expresses in his book, I dare say that he does not know the difference between an opinion and a fact. Teaching this sort of thinking to our impressionable college students is dangerous at best and disastrous at worst. College is a place where kids are supposed to be taught how to think. Indoctrination of our youth is the worst kind of sin because we are condemning the next generation to a lifetime of limited thought and stagnation of progress.There are many controversial topics in Economics. For most of them, Boyes only tells the student his own point of view. Nevermind the point of view of anyone else. This book even goes as far as including an EDITORIAL at the end of every chapter.Also disturbing, this book is full of mistakes. Mathematical errors, incorrect data, etc. I found at least two mistakes in every chapter. Most mistakes were minor, and a few were major."
3,Just be forewarned,I cannot speak for the content of the book itself but just be forewarned that this is the Study Guide (not the student package and not the book itself. I've sent amazon the corrections and they may eventually be implemented with the page numbers and I'm submitting a picture as well.
5,fab,loved this item great if you like old cartoons spent the whole morning feeling like a kid again very relaxing
3,Disappointed,I was disappointed that there was only one Bosko cartoon on this disc. And NO Peanut Butter Sandwiches! I had seen the Porky Pig cartoon on TV.
5,Looks May Be Deceiving,"I almost did not buy; because of the looks of this paper trimmer. I am tremendously pleased I bought it. The trimmer does precision cut that is straight and cuts card stock, lamination film and paper; even up to 5 sheets at a time, (3 on the card stock). I am immensely pleased with this cutter, using it frequently. It is self-sharpening, so be sure you handle accordingly."
1,not what you think,"this trimmer is no good, don't buy it. it doesn't cut 10 sheet of paper as they said, it only cuts 2 if you're lucky, you can do the same with a 10 dollar paper trimmer. don't over pay for this one."
1,Blade broke after using a few times,"I liked this product initially, but the first time I used it to cut multiple sheets (no more than ten), a little 1/16"" piece of the blade broke off and now it's unusable. I bought theDahle Model 533 Professional 12 Inch Guillotine Paper Cutterinstead and it makes the Swingline look like a toy."
4,10 Sheets for real,"I was most interested in this because I wanted something that I could cut multiple sheets of paper at the same time. I know lots of people buy these for cutting pictures, but that wasn't really my purpose. It says it can cut 10 sheets at the same time - so I counted 10 sheets and cut them. Perfect line, no movement of the papers.It's super light weight, won't see a ton of heavy duty use for me - but at least weekly I'm cutting stacks of papers. Works great."
5,Works Fine,"This paper cutter does the job, clean cuts, no problems. It is made of plastic and feels kind of cheap but it works just fine and looks nice. I have had no problems but I would not suggest it for someone who uses a paper cutter a lot. You need to spend around $60 or more for a paper cutter if you use it daily."
4,Great so far!,I bought this to help me cut out my piles of coupons. (not stack cutting) just making it easier for someone with a bad hand to cut mass amounts of things out vs using scissors that aggravate my hand.The only thing I've noticed is that it seems to catch near where the blade first meets the board when you swing it. But it doesn't really bother me that much and it still functions great!
4,cuts well,"cuts fairly straight. decent desktop cutting board. I would recommend it to people who is looking for this type of product. only issue is, you have to be careful to line up top and bottom so it cuts straight, also, you cannot cut unless you have enough thickness on both sides of the blade. can't really shave a thin slice of paper to adjust an edge as it just folds over."
4,One of the Best,"I have to say that playing Tony Hawk is fairly easy for the first time, Thrasher is more like actually learning how to skate. After first playing Tony Hawk, I was a little disappointed with Thrasher. But what they lack in graphics is made up for in gameplay. The controls were a little odd at first. But with more time, it became more enjoyable. I like both games for what they offer in gameplay."
5,yes!,"I have been waiting so long for a game like this. There are all these games out there that pretend to be extreme sports games, but they are really racing games or collect the stuff games. This is the first skateboarding game that is about the tricks. Tony Hawk is a really good game, but it's about breaking boxes and getting tapes and stuff. This game is a lot cooler."
5,Best Xmas Gift Ever for a Skateboarding Enthusiast,"If your kid likes skateboarding and video games, this is definitely the gift to give him/her. I can't believe how close to real it feels when you grind a handrail or olly over a garbage can. You can tell they really spent time making the control feel like the real thing. It's so fun and rewarding, and you really have to practice to get better, and then you are all proud when you finally pull-off a wallride! The graphics, the music, and the wipeouts are awesome!"
5,"awesome, unbelievably addictive, stellar crashes",I have a demo version of this game and cannot stop playing it. The coolest thing about the game is the hidden places that you can get too.Soundtrack is fu#*in awesome.
1,Extremely difficult game,When i first saw the game i thought it would be a really cool game. IT IS NOT! It is very hard to play and is not fun at all. If your looking for a good skateboarding game get Tony Hawk. It is way better.
2,One of the average Sk8ting games.,"I first played the demo which was messed up because every time when you fell, you would be on the ground for ever! The controls are very hard to get used to. For example when you do a hardflip you have to hold diagonally up right and press triangle. You might so what? Well while you are holding up right you are skating diagonal so you can't do a hardflip into a grind unless you do it turning. Thats just 1 example. One more I got to tell you is that the skateboards look plane fake. If you want to have fun, Tony Hawk Pro Skater is the game you want to get."
1,Thrasher Revier,"This video game is anything but fun. The graphics are bad. There are no real skateboarders. No real skate spots, and the game is down right boring. This is the worse skateboad game out there. If you are looking for some fun I would suggest Tony Hawk's Pro Skater."
1,Way to hard for us simple folk,"As close as skating as this game is, it is way to hard to sit down and try to play. All I could do was ollie and maybe a kick flip. The rest of the five minutes I spent playing this I was getting bailed and killing myself. Tony Hawk's is so much better and atleast you use real skaters. Dont by this game if you want something good."
1,WORST GAME EVER!!,"I have played the demo, and I could not believe how horrible this game was.1. The characters in this game can't skate, they hardly get any air2. Controls are hard3. I have to unplug the controller to pause the game (pressing start will start some kind of police chase)4. When I wipeout, it shows it in slow motion which is really anoying5. lame soundtrackif u want a good game then get one of the tony hawk pro skater games, whoever chooses this the best over tony hawk, they must have a monkey controling their brain"
4,Thrasher ollied over Tony Hawk,All you have to do is get 5ooo points and you are automatically sponsered for the rest of the game. It is really easy at the beginning and then you get a lot of challenge. You just need to try it.
3,Well...hard to say,"I got this game because I thought it would be better than Tony Hawk. But, don't get the wrong idea about me. I'm not one of those people who hate the game because they can't play it. No, I can play it. I beat it. It was fun. But then, I got out Tony Hawk and started playing it. Then I realized how much better Tony Hawk is. It may have less tricks but it is way more fun to play. Mostly because of the split-screen mode. Don't get me wrong, Thrasher is good, but Tony Hawk is better. Get it instead."
3,Nice try,"Thrasher is a very good skateboarding game the only problem is that it is hard to control and the tricks are sort of hard to master and pull off.On the other hand thrasher gives you a lot of options,for example the best bale option where you try and land the worst scrub.Yet the story mode is pretty lame but very challenging.I think Thrasher is a better skateboarding game for people who are looking for a challenge."
2,Not Worth Your Money,"Thrasher:Skate and Destroy is trying to be the Gran Turismo of the skateboarding world. However it fails to be a good simulation, the controls make it next to impossible for anyone to pull of a good set of moves. If you want to own a good skateboarding game buy Tony Hawk's Pro Skater."
5,Brilliant ways to take revenge,"Telemarketing should be banned, but because consumers are virtually powerless over businesses before the law, this book offers some brilliant ways to take revenge.Now, each time the phone rings and I see 'Unavailable' on my Caller ID (sure sign of a telemarketer), instead of cringing I can't wait to pick up and get even!The book has some brilliant ideas and encourages more creativity too. My favourite is to wait for the telemarketer to give you their whole story in one breath, as they always do, and then pretend you didn't hear any of it and have them repeat it."
1,Not the same as it should have been!,The board arrived in a timely manner. The BIOS chip was different .so we could not recover smoothly at all. It would not recognize the drives or the raid. We took the old BIOS chip out and put it in the new board and at least we can use the dual processors and drives although we will still have to data entry all licensing and other pertinent info that would have otherwise just loaded up.Very disappointed in this product.
2,How low can you go,"What a bad game! The designers of this game probably thought people would like a game in which you have 2 or 3 attacks and has horrible graphics, and what is with that cheesy voice. On the horrible graphics thing here is an example I walked straght into quicksand thinking it was just some strange dirt There were a few ups to the game thogh like the being able to get earthworm Kim after beating the game on you're as smart as a superhero with 1000 marbles a door will open up behind doc and touch earthworm kim but she is almost as bad as the game itself! Some of the concepts are stupid such as having to ride on a pig when fighting psycrow. If you want a good action game like this but better get Gex 3 deep cover gecko or maybe goldeneye or tommorow never dies but don't waste you're money on this game."
1,really stupid game,ok i think this game is so stupid! i mean like all you do is just walk around holding a gun until someone shoots you and the controls are like so hard to work. so my suggestion to you is not to buy this game.
1,Earthworm Jim Should Have Been Buried Long Ago.,"This game was terrable. Bad graphics, bad plot, classic moves and gameplay gone, it was not made by the same comepany who made the first two, and it ended up when it was done to only seem like a good idea! This is another great game that got killed when it was trasfered to 3D (Bubsy 3D anyone?), and just lacks more thought. Now this doesn't mean there's no hope for another Earthworm Jim game, Sonic had a few dissaster's in the 3D world on Saturn until SEGA learned to use the classic moves and feel to a Sonic game, so Jim might have a chance. But I think he should make one more 2D game before entering the 3D world again."
2,This movie is nothing special.,"I find the TV show on cartoon network to have a charm and some laughs about it, but these girls work better as a 15 minute show, this movie with it's over-long sound track, very chessey dialoge, and no story really makes it nothing more then a high budget video game. Stay with the cartoon show instead."
2,The TV episodes are much better!,"OK, the animation has been upgraded some. Fine. But then what? Why create a summary of what the PPG are all about, when there have been several seasons aired on TV already? I don't think the PPG attract a much wider audience just because they make a movie of it. The result is that most fans sit there and yawn while experiencing bad re-makes of scenes already made in the TV episodes. The humor isn't as good in the movie either, the whole impression I get is that the whole concept has been polished by ""specialists"" who believe that they know what should appeal to a mainstream audience. However, what I believe appeals to adult PPG fans is the mix of cute little kindergarten girls who beat evil people as bad as one can without getting a PG13 rating, combined with a semi-adult sense of humor. Kind of a version of the South Park humor, but without the edges and the pee&poo jokes. Which is too bad, if you ask me. ;)"
2,Disappointing to a PPG freak like me,"I watched this the day it came out. There are a numberof reasons why it was disappointing to me...1)The Dexter short at the beginning2)Only 1 villain and plot3)Cheezy humor suitable for either a 2-year old ora highly sheltered adult.Also, I got really tired of the constant nighttime scenes.... I understand that this movie was about theGirls after the Chemical X incident,but [they]couldve added more! Oh well, maybe the sequel will be better"
3,PowerPuff...PowerFlop,"I took my three year old son to see this movie and was very disappointed. My son and I often spend time together watching the Powerpuff Girls on TV. This movie was a long and over detailed movie about the creation of the Powerpuff Girls. The Girls faced their enemy MoJo JoJo. Boring. You will not see any new characters in this movie, nor any imagination. My son watched but found little to laugh at as compared to the Scooby Movie in which he laughed often. I would have rather we stayed home and watched a rerun episode of the Girls on TV than this movie."
2,"Little Sugar, A Lot of Spice, andDefinitelyNotEverything....","Nice! I am a big fan of The Powerpuff Girls. I love the show, so I thought the movie would be really cool. Well, it turns out that the movie was not that great. It's good because of the Powerpuff Girls' loving attitudes and coolness, but bad because it turns very gloomy, and you get tired of the constant, same ol' fighting over and over again. You're better off watching a new episode, because this movie was very lame. The only villain that was fought was Mojo Jojo. There was action, but it was boring and tiring. The same stuff. Not exciting. The movie was pretty depressing, and there is more color and joy in regular episodes. I prefer watching a 5 episode video of them. So, please take my advice... STAY HOME AND WATCH TV!"
3,The PowerPuff Girls Movie,"The only people I'd recommend this movie to are PowerPuff Girls fans, and people who just want something to glance at every now and then while they play computer.Not only was the movie kind of boring, but it was also nothing like The PowerPuff Girls TV show, which is what most viewers expected."
1,Maybe we would all be better off without the chemical X...,"The Powerpuff Girls show is pretty funny, and I was hoping that the movie would be just as funny. I was wrong. It was terrible. It should've been a TV movie, not feature movie. The movie was pretty good up until the game of tag. Then it magically got horrible. If they ever make another Powerpuff Girls movie, I hope it'll be much better."
2,A wonderful movie (butchered for the DVD),"If you like Powerpuff Girls you will love this movie. It's well written and nicely animated and is generally, well, a whole lot of fun.However... The fact that this movie is not avaliable in it's original wide screen format is truly disgusting.If you didn't see it in the theater then I guess you can watch this DVD and be blissfully unaware of all the footage you're missing. But to me, it's ruined. I got this DVD as a present, watched it once and was so annoyed by the butchering of the film I haven't watched it since.So, even though I'd give the movie itself five stars I had to give the DVD two. And being a fan of the Powerpuff Girls that was hard to do."
5,My Granddaughter Loved It!!,I bought this for my 3-year-old granddaughter. She has become obsessed with the Powerpuff Girls. The movie was shipped quickly and played great in the DVD player. No complaints!
2,PowerPuff's go POOF!,"I've been waiting to see this movie for months! I was ready to have a good time, but the powerpuff's let me down. How could this happen?Unfortunately the story is a prequel to the show detailing how the girls came to be and why they decided to fight crime. Why is that bad? Well the audinece it's most likely to see the movie watches the show regularly, and the show has already told us many of these details. So I wound up sitting there waiting for something to surprise me, to offer something that I didn't already know. Not only did that never happen, but I was subjected to 10 minutes of Bubbles crying! Fight scens dragged on and on as did a game of tag. it's like the writers couldn't think of wnything good so they just let the girls run amonk for 6 minutes. The whole movie just felt like an over-long episode. I was very disappointed.For a truly fun, cute family film filled with heart, check out the immuserably better Lilo & Stitch."
3,"Great film, but deserves Better",This film needs to be released in Widescreen with both a new special edition and a Blu-ray release. That would be the perfect compliment to the complete series set which was just released. Please do this Warner Bros! It is something a great number of people would appreciate. I have always wanted this film in its original aspect ratio. I already own this release but would double dip in a heartbeat for a proper release of the film!
4,The Girls Have Never Been Better but the Warners Screw it Up,"This is definently the best animated movie to come along in a while. While the Warners have screwed it up in almost every concievable way in the form of marketing, advertising,etc. it still is one great movie. Alas, the Warners can't leave it alone. No widescreen transfer is amazingly dissapointing as PPG is an action-oriented movie with alot going on. It seems cramped sometimes and I saw the movie in theatres and yes there is a good bit of cropping. Why they can't just let you choose to watch between widescreen and fullscreen is a mystery. Oh well. At least they did pull through on the extras with hilarious interviews, 4 deleted scenes, funny character commentaries and a commentary from director Craig McCracken and art director Mike Moon. Still though no widescreen detracts from the DVD's final score. Hopefully they'll release an uncut, widescreen version of the film next spring.....but I doubt it."
1,Too scary for kids,"This movie was disturbing to me -- since when is mechanically ""sucking out"" monkey brains entertainment for children? I strongly advise against taking your kids to see this movie."
1,Awful with some inappropriate content...and I'm not a prude,"I took my four and a half year old daughter to see this, as she will occasionally watch the show on tv. The tv version itself is somewhat amusing so I thought this would be something to go and see. I could not wait for it to be over. True, it did tell the story of how they came to be, which may have been interesting, but it was not. The drawings/picture itself was no better than tv, the plot was boring and there were some very crude jokes which I found inappropriate for her to be watching. It was also very violent, more so than the usual crime busting they do in the show. As I said, I am not a prude but I felt this was really terrible and somewhat inappropriate for younger kids."
1,WarnerBrothers lost their minds.,"This movie was nothing like the t.v. show.For one There was way too much violence.And WB is going to make little kids think that every monkey in the world is going to try to take over the world. In 2002, when WB was making this movie, they must have lost their brains."
1,"**** wide-screen, **** powerpuffs, **** craig mccracken",for those who don't know the director and love to send him E-mail on how stupid of a movie this was and the series all together. cartoon network are showing a **gameboy special censor** marthon of this stupid pile of **censor again**.i can not understand why they would make this movie and then make a marthon of this just so kids can grown-up liking volience.I have son named gameboy.he hated how boring it was. With a game tag how the hell can the whole TOWNVILLE be destroy. this whole movie had gameboy looking at the ground. this movie was about as boring as bag of 2-dollar COMCAST baseball ticket that have subscriptions to tonka RC cars.
2,Disappointing,"I absolutely love the Powerpuff Girls. I consider it one of the best cartoons on american television, and even though I'm 18 I absolutely love pretty much any cartoon. That said, I was sorely disappointed by the movie. While the show is fast paced, humorous and light-hearted, I felt the movie was slow and spent far too much time trying to flesh out a very simple back story that anyone who's seen the opening credits of the TV show already knows. The movie was very dark, too, not nearly as colorful and bright as the TV show.The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of Mojo Jojo, my favorite villain, who features prominently in this movie and actually lives up to and maybe even surpasses his TV appearances."
2,No widescreen! Arrrrgh!,"I had every intention of buying this movie, until I found out it was fullscreen only. I suspect many people who would have otherwise bought this DVD will be skipping it because of the lack of widescreen. Sorry, Warner, but you blew it, big-time. Maybe next time you'll give people what they want: a choice."
3,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED!,"I am a big fan of the Powerpuff Girls t.v. show and this movie is not a good example of what a real episode is like. Yea, it has all the pop culture referenses and a few laughs but it is too busy trying to be a big screen, over the top animation marvel. They should have stuck to the original formula and both old and new fans would have been amazed. The plot is slow and there is not enough dialogue from the girls. It is just flat. Sorry Girls!!"
2,"Awesome movie, why full-screen only?","The movie's a joy but I expect to be able to buy movies that perserve the aspect ratio of the film. DTS would have been nice as well. With a running time of only 73 minutes, all of these features could have been put on the same disc.Warner Brothers/AOL/Time Warner - I'm sorry this movie wasn't a big money maker. It really should have done better. But that's no excuse to short shrift DVD buyers. If you can put out an anamorphic widescreen edition, I'll change my rating to 5 stars."
3,It's OK,If you are a fan of the PPG you will love this movie. I sometimes watch the TV Show and decided to see this movie. The movie is basically what happened in Townsville before the PPG and when the city was first learning to accept them. I would recomend this movie for people 12 and under. If you like the PPG TV Show you should deffinetly see this movie. It did not fall short of my expectations at all.
2,OK for some...,"I thought this CD was okay, but most of my friends didn't know the songs and the graphics didn't help all that much. I really would reccomend something more along the lines of pop or rock like Britney Spears, Backstreet Boys or Everclear. More people find their songs more enjoyable, I know I do!"
2,Robin Hood Country,I do not like the music that much. The one track that I heard on the radio was the only song that I enjoyed.
2,DOA - Dead On Arrival,"This somniferous, undistinguished, and lightweight recordingcontains about 18 minutes of cues from Erich Wolfgang Korngold'sfilm symphony which is the focus of this review. It oftenborders on cruel and unusual punishment for the listener ingeneral, and is sheer torture for Korngold enthusiasts.Nonetheless, it is a courageous undertaking for a regionalorchestra (the East of England Orchestra). If you wish toencourage more regionals to perform and record Korngold's filmmusic (highly recommended!), buy this CD. If not, move on."
4,I Enjoyed It,I enjoyed this movie but truthfully it wasn't as spectacular as I was expecting it to be. I guess my expectations are just too high for Pixar movies. It's definitely worth watching but not necessarily a must see.
5,Wonderful Movie,"Great Disney movie. As you can see from the plentiful of 5 star reviews, this is a great movie!"
5,Great movie - even better in Blu-Ray,"Some movies in HD (either HD-DVD or Blu-Ray) look and sound only marginally better than their standard definition counterparts. RATATOUILLE, however, is one of those movies that can really be appreciated even more if you are fortunate to own a Blu-Ray player.I have watched both the standard def and the Blu-Ray versions on my Blu-Ray player. The Blu-Ray version looks better than the standard def version (although the standard def version looks quite good too.)For me, HD (both formats) really excel in the audio mix. Small, subtle details are more easy to discern in the HD version and that is certainly the case with this movie. Center channel dialog is crisp and clean. If you have a really good monitor and home theatre system, do yourself a favor and spend the few extra dollars for the Blu-Ray version.Oh yes, I suppose you'll also need to buy a Blu-Ray player or PlayStation 3.Disney really understands the value of turning out a superior product."
3,"Anyone can cook, even a rat","Disney comes up with another clever story. The graphics are incredible and the story delightful. I would have given it three and a half stars if I could. Although not ""The Lion King"" caliber, it is quite good. This may cause some cringes as most people associate rats with filth and disease. The thought of a rat touching your food isnt exactly mouth watering.A rat follows a TV show put on by a French chef and begins to experiament in changing his garbage fare into something more delectable. When he ends up in Paris he tries to help the chef that inspired him by assisting his son in the chef's restaurant. Interesting take on how a food critics perspective changes. Good quality DVD with great replayability."
4,"Technically wonderful, but falls short on the story-line","I enjoyed the movie tremendously for its beautiful graphics and technical excellence. However, I didn't get the same warm fuzzy feeling from the other Pixar movies like Toy Story or Finding Nemo. I couldn't relate with most of the characters in the movie, especially with Linguini. I'd still keep a copy around the house as reference to a well-put-together-animation movie."
3,Little good little bad,As is typical with most recent Disney with the exception of Cars this film starts off strong then drags then picks up again in the end. Kids will love it and adults might become bored during the meat of the movie.
5,"A+++ for Disney and Pixar, A must for your collection.","As with all Disney Animated movies, and now Digital-Animated movies since they bought Pixar Studios and even before when Pixar was a stand alone Company. This feature presentation is a breath of fresh air compared to any other studio production. One can sense everything the characters can, except smell. According to the famous Food Network super-chef celebrity Emeril 'They should have invented ""Smell-ovision'Patton Oswalt's rendition of Remy is just amazing, he actually makes an average American human, as opposed to an American rodent, have warm feelings for a rat."
4,Ratatouille is a Cute Movie,"We got this DVD last night and watched it after dinner with our 5 year old. We did not see the movie in the theater and were excited to watch it.... actually we purchased it for christmas... but that didn't last. Our 5 year old was excited about the movie. The movie is very cute but I found myself wandering away from the movie and not caring if I was missing parts of it. Our 5 year old watched it but seemed that he would have been just as happy watching one of our other movies. So... while the movie is cute, and there are scenes that are funny, the story lags in places. I did enjoy the movie, and plan to watch the whole thing next time.... but I wish there was less running around the kitchen and maybe more story. Very cute and kids will love it."
5,"Great movie, smartest rat i've ever seen","This is one of the best Pixar movies I have seen so far. The story line is well put together. The movie have tons of details from over looking Paris at night time, the sewers, restaurants and other vivid places. This movie shows a relationship between a human and a intelligent domestic rat trying to bring back Gusteau's good name. This movie mainly takes place at Gusteau's restaurant in Paris. Its very comical and will bring you tons of joy when you see Remy(rat) complete his goal."
5,Excellent Movie!,"As long as you're the type of person who can smile at an adorable animated rat that cooks, you'll love this too."
1,Wrong format ratatouille,The disc and the package were in good condition but apparently was on a European format and will not play in any of our devices. If you have another Ratatouille formatted for the u.s. I would appreciate an exchange
5,Rat Food Is Good.,A Rat Making food. Well at least he better then this man in the kitchen. My wife gave me a T-Shirt. Danger Man Cooking. I saw this in the threate and it was great. For an old gent it was truly a great movie. Cute and love the critic in the movie. It Disney and one of the Better show to come out. Worth getting and play over. I be seeing the this Rat the France builting in Epcot.
4,Should buy rather than rent...,"This is one that I have paid to see more than once... will make the perfect download to the kindle for road trips.The story is cute and imaginative. and uplifting. In a world full of princesses... I much prefer the scruffy ""anyone can cook"" message of this story. The physical comedy of the boy chef is adorable and the larger message of mass consumption is subtle but present. LOVE LOVE LOVE"
5,Excellent,"This movie is great. My grandson 3 yrs. old loves it. We have watched it at least 100 times. Cute, Cute, Cute."
4,"Good family movie, despite the gun violence.","My wife and I aren't totally nutty about our 2 yr old being exposed to violence on TV but we do avoid it 98% of the time. Part of the remaining 2% is Ratatoullie.Ratatoullie is a good kid's movie aside from the two scenes of gun violence: one in the beginning where an old woman shoots up her house trying to kill two rats and another where a woman is seen pointing a gun at her lover during and argument just before the discharges off camera and they are shown to embrace. Aside from those scenes, I think that the movie is appropriate for virtually any age. Plus, it's one of the few kid's movies we have that I'm not sorry to be subjected to. :)"
5,Best Kid Movie I Have Ever Seen!,"By far the best in my opinion. The Animation is amazing. Certain scene's looked pretty real. The comedy was off the chart, even with a little romance.Great dubbing. The voice over/reaction time of the voice's/character's was Amazing. I would recommend this movie to all ages. Great plot, great idea's. Character's were fantastic. I was laughing throughout most of the movie. Kids will love as well as they're parents."
4,fun family movie,This movie is great fun for everybody. A fun family movie for all and at a great price.
5,Good stuff,"Normally I'm not a huge fan of cartoons. I kind of fell out of watching them a while back, other than stuff like the Simpsons and Futurama. However, for a movie primarily targeted toward kids I actually got a kick out of this one even though I bought it for my girlfriend.I would reommend it if you're looking for a good way to spend about an hour and a half with some kids or possibly your girlfriend/wife. :)"
5,Enjoyable for all ages,We watched this as a family (ages 9 through 79) and we all enjoyed it! Good movie with clean humor.
5,DELIGHTFUL!,"Ratatouille is one of the most wonderful animated pictures ever made. Full of vivid imagery that captures the child's imagination in all of us. It is a movie that literally everyone in your family will love. If you're looking for a delicious adventure, Ratatouille is the movie."
3,"Kind of boring, but funny at times","My daughter wanted this movie for a long time, and the previews seems really funny. After I bought it however, she lost interest pretty quickly. The movie starts how being funny, then it gets kind of boring, and Ratty turns into a total snob towards his family. In the end however the movie ends well with everyone happy and Ratty making up with his family. Overall I think the movie was overated."
3,"OK, not great and questionable content","Had some cute parts, but not near as cute or entertaining - for either adults or kids as The Incredibles or Cars. Also, I don't like the fact that Lingini is the illegetimate son of the chef. Why do they have to put stuff like that in a kids cartoon? I was very disappointed in Disney and Pixar for putting in content like that. There is no need for it."
1,"Great movie, but crappy copyright protection freezes DVD player!","This movie is a great movie - I've always loved Pixar's productions, however, you might want to be careful, because Disney has placed the ARccOS copyright protection scheme on this DVD. To me, this shouldn't even be called a DVD, because the ARccOS DVD protection inserts ""bad sectors"" all over the DVD, This means that some DVD players, including mine, freeze up periodically during loading, playing, etc, and cause headaches trying to view the movie. Be really careful about this DVD, as Disney claims that there 'isn't anything wrong' and that I should just 'fast forward through the parts that are not compatible with my DVD player'."
3,Too many commercials,"Excellent movie and high-def transfer is fantastic. However, Disney just can't stop cramming more and more previews before the movie. BD disk has about 10. It took me good 5 minutes to skip through them. And all those 'coming soon' will look ridiculous in a year or two."
3,Blue ray quality is poor as a dvd!!,"I was expecting more quality with blue ray, but it's almost like a dvd quality. It's no to much the difference!!!"
3,Husband's favorite movie,This is my husband's favorite animated movie. It is a great movie though you are not able to view it through the Apple TV nor can you download it on to a Mac computer that is why I gave it 3 stars.
5,Made me want to sign up for culinary school,"Extremely entertaining and clever. Superb! Great casting, too. Peter O'Toole is the cherry on the sundae."
4,Good film-not outstanding,"This film was good. I did expect it to be better or funnier.No outstanding music. But, the Disney/Pixar films have not had the music you expect.Very disappointing not a 2 disc set. I always like to see makings of stories, behind the scenes information.And, ONCE AGAIN, IT HAS 1 OF THESE HORRIBLE DVD CASES WITH THE TINY FLIP OPEN FLAPS. THEY ARE TERRIBLE!!"
3,A rat that is a gourmet Chef - Funny idea for 10 minutes,And the gags become as stale as last weeks baggets as he trys to teach an idiot that can't boil water how to cook. The only saving of grace is Pixar's high quality CG that makes the movie visually appealing.
3,Every Pixar Movie Had Spanish Translation Until This One!!!,"My mother (now 82) loves all the pixar movies... But now that Disney bought pixar, they're producing two movies (one in english and one in spanish) SHAME ON YOU DISNEY!!! You can do what EVERYONE ELSE DOES and have both soundtracks on the same DVD... But NOOOOOO! You want to sell more DVDS so you make it ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE for spanish speakers to RENT your movie!!! YOU DO THIS WITH MANY OF YOUR MOVIES AND MY MOTHER IS VERY DISSAPOINTED!!!"
2,Disappointing,"This movie was highly recommended by everyone I knew who had seen it. While the basic idea is cute and clever, it was beaten into the ground! The movie was about a half hour too long."
1,should have been a nice movie,"The item I ordered came on time. However, it did not work in my DVD player, much to my 5 yr. old nephew's dissappointment. The seller gave me a refund. We got another DVD movie instead."
3,Delivered on time,"I ordered this for a Christms gift for the grandchildren., It was delievered on time. I have not watched the movie, so I cannot speak on how good it is."
2,Rats in the Kitchen?,"I love Pixar movies, but this one actually made me sick thinking about rats cooking. I was hoping I could get past it, but couldn't. The talent of the Pixar group is incredible, they just needed a better script with different critters than the rats!"
1,A cinematic milestone in my life,"I can safely say that I've seen well over 1,000 moving pictures in my years and I've had a lot of different responses to each and every one; some have left me baffled either with their genius or their idiocy, some have left me in chills and some have left me completely numb and utterly bleak.BUT Pixar Disney's latest installment in animated banality actually managed to make me vomit it was so bad. Seriously, the film ended, and I was so overcome with anger at it's sheer stupidity and absolute lack of humor that I retched up some of my dinner. Congratulations.The general population really is full of nitwits if trash like this can flourish as well as it has.Toy Story was absolutely magnificent, everything after that has been total tripe."
4,"Shut up, and eat your garbage!","Our kids love this movie! It's mildly entertaining for us adults too even though the fake French accents are a little hard to understand at times - thank goodness for subtitles. The french cityscape and kitchen are animated in hyper-realism, while the characters are delightfully cartoony - the rat, Remy, bears an eerie similarity to the novice chef Linguini(NOT a French name!) There is the usual Disney tendency to have too many characters, as if the main characters could not stand on their own. Fortunately the plot focuses on the battle between Linguini and the suitably villainous restaurant owner, with a side of romance, and on the differences between the sensitive Remy and his more pragmatic father who utters the priceless line: ""Shut up, and eat your garbage!""A fun movie for the whole family and a visual feast as well. One warning: the scene where the old lady blasts all the rats with a shotgun might be frightening to younger ones."
4,Hail French Cooking!,"I purchased this one for a California artist friend who just returned from sabatical in France. While there, she was told that she had a ""French nose."" It seems that what she'd grown so used to seeing in the mirror had a talent! A means to detect the unique, the illusive, the earnestly sought after! Odors, well-acclaimed in French culinary circles! Crazy! I told her that the mouse in this movie had one too, suggesting she watch him brew up hilarity when her day started out dark and dreary. And to create! Soup! Enough soup to fill the house with glorious smells!"
4,Stepchild of the Pixar Family,"Like every single one of Pixar's films, this was witty, beautiful and genuine, but in the end felt like light fare compared to some of the studio's masterworks. It didn't have the suspense of The Incredibles, the heart of Up or the scale of Wall-E, for example, but that's not to say I didn't enjoy it. The script had a few legit family-friendly laughs and the animation had some moments of inspiration, (I really liked the visualizations of competing/combining flavors) and it gets points for trying out a unique setting but this never really had that moment where everything shifted into overdrive. Ah, well. My least favorite Pixar effort is still better than most of the competition."
5,ratatoullie,"Grandchildren just loved this movie, and grandma did too!! Thanks for the speedy delivery, and the CD was marvelous, the packageing was superb, just as it was it was advertised. Thanks again I'll be back, regards and best wishes for the new year."
5,One of those movies you can watch a trillion times!,"My son received this movie for a gift shortly after it came out on DVD, and it is a family favorite! We have watched it countless times but it's one of those movies that the whole family will stop and watch rather than being one of the many videos that end up being played in the background! I would definitely suggest this movie for any family, especially with toddlers +!"
5,Not your normal Pixar movie,"This is not your normal action-packed Pixar movie. It's rather the opposite of The Incredibles, for example. It's a sweet coming-of-age story about a rat who finds his unique place in the world. Don't expect action, and you will not be disappointed."
5,Pixar's Best So Far.,"This is in my opinion Pixar's best film so far. The animation is beautiful to watch, the characters are wonderful, the direction is fantastic. Technically the water and fur are standouts, and the art direction is beautiful."
4,Disney/Pixar has a hit again!,"I loved this movie, as an adult taking my 4 year old, it was a delight. Great story line, graphics are awesome and it kept you entertained throughout, very fast paced. The only reservation I have is the rating the movie received of ""G"". I say this because early on the movie there was a scene in which Violence was used in the form of a "" shotgun "" in an attempt to kill rats, in which this movie are actual characters!. I don't approve of violence in any form for my kids, although my kid took it in stride(I hope).The scene was scary enough though that some children were frightened and crying in the theater. Anyway, if your kid likes movies like Shrek, then this is very good for them, just not for anyone very little."
1,Rat's talking to a dead person thru movie,"This could have been a good movie. It started out good, and was very funny. Lot's of laugh's, however, when the rat started talking to the dead cook as a ghost in his imagination....something just didn't sit well with me on that.Adults, okay, you get it, but is this something I want my young children contemplating? That maybe they can talk and have conversations with imaginary dead people. What a shame, the sneaky filth they try to fill our Children with."
1,Bad quality,"I received the movie.. soon I played it, the movie DVD has problem lik scrach on it.. I have problem to see the movie"
1,Ratatouille garbage,"I was STOLEN with this stupid DVD. It doesn't have Spanish audio or subtitles. ONLY ENGLISH. Amazon says it is DOUBLED, but that is not true. If you like to see movies with Spanish audio, don't buy this."
5,Dispite Angry Parents,"This movie had a few more adult things in it than most Disney Pixar Movies. The alchohol, the use of the word hell are things that do not belong in a children's movie. But overall I, personally found this movie fun and full of beautiful Computer Animation that just wowed me."
3,good but...,"This is my personal opinion. I looked and looked when I was buying this film and never saw that it was not in other languages.I bought it as a gift for somebody who wanted to see it in French. This person is a fan.I would not say that the film details depicted on the web ad are misleading, but it does not have all the info.I would have loved to know that before buying it...So, only English... and not subtitles in other languages!Add it to your details, please!"
5,Great Picture,"This a great picture for....grownups. Children can enjoy it, but adults may cherish it.A lot of human nature is explored in such magnificent kids picture.I recommend it heartly"
4,Cute.,"As with any Disney it's worth the watch. It's very charming and endearing. Although my kids are getting to the ages they don't care that much for cartoons, they both still enjoy watching this."
2,Another Bizarre DVD version,"This movie is quite good, it gets 4 stars. The DVD presentation, however, blows. Disney has, yet again, inserted an introduction that cannot be skipped or fast forwarded over, and must be watched every time the disc is inserted. Why do they keep doing this?"
3,"Sorry,","but I have to disagree with the critics. I thought the movie was boring. I know I will take some heat for this but it just didn't come across as any thing spectacular. We couldn't wait to see this movie from all the great reviews that it received. I couldn't find a single reason this movie was any better than average. When those rats started flowing in and around the food storage.....yuck! No, the book was wrong, not just anybody can learn to cook!"
2,Dissapointing,"I was so disappointed by this movie. All the hype and talk and ...nothing. The animation was absolutely excellent, really outstanding. The story was rather slow and had way to many ""messages"". The ""don't steal"" message had me rolling my eyes every single of the 10000 times it was mentioned. It was an obvious way to build up to the climax of the story. And really, G rated? There is a woman, with a gun, wrestling with a man for said gun and then they make up; the kissing scene - you can see their tongues moving inside their cheeks and there is the full body checkout by Linguini...ok....oh well. The story dragged on too much, it was boring...but the animation was excellent."
2,Just for Kids,"I know there are reviewers who say this film should be in the ""Best Picture"" category for an Oscar, but after the initial premise unfolded and the animation wonder was revealed I was bored out of my mind. I think you have to be under 18 to fall in love with this --- or have a spirit that is a great deal more youthful than mine. The kids will love it, but this ain't adult viewing material, unless you have to watch with the kids."
3,Disappointing,"We and our 3 and 5.5 year-olds are big fans of movies like Shrek, Wallace and Gromit, Cars, Madagasgar, Toy Story, Monsters, Inc., but Ratatouille disappointed us. The story has scenes that are unnecessarily violent and/or scary, and there are plot elements that are complicated to explain to a five year old. Unlike the above movies, sustaining our adult interest was a strain. It's visually well done and has good moments, and if your kids have been immersed in violence to the point where they don't mind seeing a protagonist repeatedly blasted at by a shotgun-wielding old woman, then they will probably find this movie ""enchanting"" as others have. It wasn't for us though."
3,Pretty good,"I liked the movie although a bit drawn out.The message was not so clear, even thought I can get an idea of what they were going for, but using a rat for this message was lost to me due to the nature of a rat.Fun, colorful and a bit offbeat. I would rather had rented it first."
3,Movie is ok,Initially I loved the story but the animations of pixstar are usually much better than the ones on this film.
4,tight film,i caught this film over the weekend and enjoyed the creativity and overall storyline and concepts. the pacing and adventures in the kitchen and all the things going just added so much to this film which will hold your interest from start to finish. it was a rags to riches and reality based film that will make you pay attention to details and everything else in between.very good and charming film.
5,great,Everything was as the company said it would be. I was very pleased with the quailty especially because it was used.
5,terrific,I was impressed with the quality of the storytelling as well as the animation. I would strongly recommend it. well done.
3,No French option? Zut alors!,"I loved the movie, but I can't seem to give it more than 3 stars. How can a French-themed movie, like Ratatouille, only offer it in the English language with NO option to watch it in French or Spanish. I assumed that a DVD like Shreck (which comes with English, French and Spanish language options--STANDARD VERSION) would have paved the way. Get this, you can even buy it in a Spanish version separately, but not in French."
5,I'm so glad I have a Blu Ray player now!,I recently snapped up a Sony PS3 because I didn't want to wait any longer for the format war to end and had established that Blu Ray was far better than HD and selling much more anyway. I have not been disappointed! This movie just pins exactly what Blu Ray is all about and delivers crystal clear animation with a wonderful depth of audio. It adds so much more to an animated masterpiece such as this and is worth every cent! I'm glad I took the plunge because I am enjoying movies so much more now.
4,.,Great heart as a cartoon. Showing that if you put your mind to it you can some time accomplish your goals even if you are ubaware of what they are at first.
5,a gift,This is one of my best memorys. I love it and hope my Granddaughter loves it as will thanks again
5,Ratatouille blu ray version,Okay I'm a 21 year old guy and this was the secound blu ray I bought 2 years ago. I thought the movie was cute the colore and the picture quality is top notch. I would give the movie 5 out of 5 stars and the pq qaulity a 5. The specail features are good to.
4,You have to love a rat that can cook one mean meal.,I loved the movie only because I love critters. My daughter loved the movie because a rat can cook and talk. The move is cute and fine detailed. Although warning after watching it ten times can make you sick of it. So watch it here and there. BUY this movie for any one that loves critters and kids that love to watch animals cook. Do not buy for someone that easily gets grossed out or is majorly afraid of germs and critters.
5,Excellent movie,"A bit unconventional in its approach to fine dining, but this movie will entertain people of all ages. Whether you be a food-critic, or a rat."
3,Not Pixar's Best,"I have always been a huge fan of Pixar films but I was a little disappointed with Ratatouille.The animation was by far the best of any CG film to date. They have finally perfected hair and water. The scenes of Paris, especially at night, and the action sequence in the sewer were great and deserve to be seen on the big screen.But I was not captivated by the story. There is way too much violence for the very young (A shotgun-blasting grandmother, dead rats in shop window, a female chef threatening to kill another co-worker, just to name a few)and not enough adult humor for the grown-ups. In fact, there was very little laughter in the theater throughout the film. I hope that Pixar's next film, WALL E (summer 2008) returns to the style of Monsters Inc, The Incredibles and Cars - films which had something for everyone."
2,"Great movie, but freezes when played...","The movie is great, but every time we put in the DVD, it freezes when it comes to the menu. Others have had this problem (see other reviews). Disney should reissue this DVD. Major problem."
4,ok,I haven't played dvd yet bilut will. Its deff used. Some water damage to cover but that'd ok. Mine would look just like ut. Haha. Its came very quickly. Ordered Saturday came Tuesday
3,DVD,"Recieved quickly, have not had time to watch the DVD to see if it works. The case is in great shape"
3,Pretty Good,"DVD was in good condition. However as soon as I opened the case it smelled like ciggarette smoke. Other than that, everything was fine. Arrived on time and was barely scratched."
3,Ratatouille,I love this movie & I bought it for my nephew because every time he seen the previews for it he would kick his feet get excited yell scream & giggle!! I think the dvd got messed up in delivery though because it skips & it was not fully sealed in the case!!
3,The Health Department Triumphs,"My grandchildren liked this movie as did their parents but I was not nearly as enthusiastic about the rats in the kitchen or in the sewer for that matter, when they went on to the kitchen. The hordes of rats sort of freaked out my wife and while the movie went to great lengths to assure the audience that the rats were clean and sanitary the fact is when they raided the pantry they didn't wash their hands and did in fact contaminate the food which was later used. Thankfully the Health Department closed the place down. Of course this is only a cartoon and shouldn't be taken too seriously. As a cartoon it was well executed and undoubtedly appealed to its target audience. This wasn't one of Disney's best efforts but when compared to what is generally being offered to kids on TV it is outstanding. A cute movie, kids will love it, predictable and a little unnerving if not downright spooky at times. Unless you have kids I think I would miss this one."
3,Kids got bored...,"Both of my children, ages 7 and 4 got bored with this movie. Both wandered away to do something else fairly early in the movie. It was entertaining at times, but it wasnt enough to hold my interest either. The characters are cute and all, but it was just OK."
3,"DVD quality sucks, movie is great.","I don't know what is happening to the quality of DVD's recording but it takes little more than a firm gip to permanently damage the DVD to where it skips and stops and jumps. I have an older DVD player but also have several Godzilla DVD's that are over 10 years old that have taken at least 10 times the use and don't skip a wink. This Ratatouille DVD is no longer playable. I don't buy DVD's from Amazon anymore for this fact alone. I get them at the local Walmart where I can take them back if they become defective too easily. The manufacturer of the DVD appears to be different at Walmart as well, based on the case, but it still may be the same DVD manufacturer, just not sure. I have had the same problems with CARS and SHRECK DVD's."
3,Movie's great but...,"We love this movie, it's the shipping we have issues with... we received the box all bent and smashed and then the 2 movie cases inside were all bent inside as well... certainly not in any shape to give as gifts... fortunately the movie still played OK to spite how bad the case was smashed and bent. Maybe the movies should be sent in movie mailers, not regular boxes that are easily smashed and bent."
2,Boooooring,"The animation is beautiful, but that's it for this movie. My 10 y.o. daughter wanted to leave the theater in the middle of the movie. The characters and plot are not compelling. The restaraunt critic is funny, but he comes in for about 5 minutes at the end. Save your time and money, or just watch The Icredibles again."
2,Slow cooking,This film has paper thin stereotyped characters that move slowly and painfully through an adult themed plot. My children of 4 and 6 walked out of the theatre because it was so boring. There are no surprises as you can pretty much guess what is going to happen next. While they may have been attempting the ultimate fish out of water story the simple fact that rats in your kitchen is a disgusting concept. There are a lot of better films for your children.
2,"Boring, kids wont really get it","This is an adult movie. What I mean by that is children wouldnt understand the point of this film. I mean come on, culinary art? Why would that even interest kids? It didnt even interest me and I'm 24. It wasn't funny or cute it was just odd. Of course the computer work on this is fantastic, but that is where it stops. I do not understand why so many people love this film. I was utterly bored and dissinterested in it from the beginning."
4,Impossible not to like.,"There are so many things wrong with this movie, I don't even know where to begin. And yet... I can't deny that I've fallen for it. The Rats are cute, the people are suitably oafish, the commentary on cuisine is accurate enough without being pedantic.If you've liked previous Pixar movies, I'm sure you'll love this one. Not Brad Bird's best work, but nothing to be ashamed of."
4,Very cute!,"This movie didn't catch the attention of my 3-year-old right away, but it has grown on him. I really enjoy it!"
4,Fine film I would feel safe showing children,"First understand that I am a lover of classic disney films such as: Peter Pan, Jungle Book, Old Yeller, Snow White, Bambi, and many others. I am probably more sceptical of recent Disney releases than most of my cohorts, so this movie had to earn 4 stars from me. It is entertaining, a film parents can trust to allow children of all ages watch, and is equally entertaining for adults. I would by no means put it on par with some of the Disney classics. However, that being said this is by far one of the best films Disney has done in the past 20 years. This film has the feel of one of the classic Disney films prior to the 1980's. A thoroughly enjoyable movie for all ages (I can't say that for all of Disney's recent releases).My version of this movie comes with two short films. One is the history of the rat, which is actually very educational and informative. The other short is moderately entertaining but nothing I feel deserves more than a passing comment."
4,Very Cute - Wife loved it,"The blonde and I went to see this movie as a compromise since she accomanied me to Transformers last summer. Well it turned out to be a very cute movie, and we both enjoyed it. I bought the DVD for her for Christmas, to this day it's one of her favorites."
5,Ratatouille gets 5 Stars!,"Disney and Pixar have done it again with ""Ratatouille"". This was a great movie that I saw with my 10-year old son when it was the the theater and it was at the top of his Christmas list. It's a fun and funny movie that we have watched several times since Christmas. A gem in today's movie releases."
5,Ratatouille Review,"Surprised how long it took to get here. I ordered something else at the same time and it was received at least a week earlier. But it got here in time for Christmas and was a big hit with the grandkids AND their parents so all is well that end's well, I guess. I had also purchased the Ratatouille Cook Book which was lots of fun."
5,For lovers of food too,"Never knew you could become best friends with a rat, but this movie does that. I enjoyed the story and the great animation, the little details of how a kitchen is run are amazing. This is fun if you're young, but also when you're adult."
4,Adorable kids movie!,"Being a big kid myself, I went to see this one with another adult friend. Sure, lived through the back of my seat being kicked by a small child throughout the entire movie...but you'll have this.Anyway, what a delightful movie! If you don't fall in love with Remy within the first 5 minutes, you're not watching the movie.Take the kids or take yourself to see this one! Wonderful for all ages!"
4,Great family movie,"Fun and engaging characters, good morals, cute story. Great for exposing young kids to the restaurant-side of the culinary arts. Definitely recommend."
5,Tastes Great!,My daughter (an aspiring chef) and I found this story a magically inspirational tale. Chock full of life wisdom that one day I may just have to use in leadership development training. This movie has an important story to tell. I did not see rats I saw beings striving to reach their potential in a biased world.Beautiful!
3,Skimpy on Bonus Features,Wonderful movie! 5 stars from me. However I'm disappointed in the lack of commentary track and thin amount of bonus material. These movies are enjoyed by animation students and fans of Pixar as well as children. Lets hear from the animators and production artists involved! Lets see their work! I will say it's a better release than the Car's DVD was.It includes a fantastic short hosted by Remmy and Emille! As well as a short behind the scenes with Brad Bird that leaves you wanting more!I might suggest renting instead of buying due to the lack of extras.
5,fun for the whole family,"If you loved all of the previous Pixar releases, add this one to the list. Entertaining, fabulous graphics, great story. The whole family enjoyed this one."
3,Good Movie,"This product never came, to this day I don't knowwhat happened to it, or where it was sent to. So I got a refund and ordered another one. The movie was brand new and came right away this time. It is a wonderful movie for the whole family to enjoy, there are many funny moments and no slow parts. I would reccomend this movie, however I might want to place the order weeks in advance incase it never gets to you."
4,ratatouille,Thanks for your prompt fast free shipping. These are Christmas presents for my grandchildren. They will be viewed over and over and over......Pricing was very good.
5,Pixars best,"A truly amazing film that has fun characters, an amazing vilian with great colors and music, not to mention a great climax"
4,worked great on multiple devices,This works really well on my ps3 and ipad. I would really like to use this on Android though. I went with amazon instant video to find a cross platform service so I only have to buy a movie once and I can watch it any way I want.Movie is wonderful and the steaming service on ps3 worked flawlessly.
3,Ratatouille,"I was greatly looking forward to see this movie again - one of the best animations I have seen in years. Unfortunately, the DVD was flawed and - in the middle - it jammed/tiled, to my embarrassment as I had invited many of my friends to see it. What can be done to have it replaced?"
3,Rataouille,The movie quite OK but not as good as others from Pixar e.g. Nemo or The Incredibles.A bit tool long.
3,"Funny, but...","This was a cute video. I'm not a big fan of ""Ross"" so that kinda spoiled it for me. Sorry, I loved Friends, but he's just too over the top for me. Also I have this thing about rats and even though they were animated, the idea of thousands of rats climbing on someone and running around the kitchen gave me the willies. Silly, I know, but it did. Cute story line though."
3,Save your money,"My husband wanted to see this movie, so I bought it and figured it would make a cute movie to watch with our 3 and 5 yr old. WRONG! I've tried popping it in twice, and the kids have ZERO interest in watching it. So far, this is the only movie they've had no interest in watching. It's a little long, and to be honest, a little boring. I'd rent or borrow first before spending the money to see it. Toy Story, The Incredibles, and Finding Nemo were much bigger hits with my crew (all get asked over and over again to be watched)."
2,Disappointing,"Based on the ads, I'd expected this film to focus on the rat character. Instead, after a good start, it focused heavily on the 'human' characters, thereby losing much of its charm."
3,A movie to watch with kids,"The graphics on this cartoon is good. The human expressions were well done. Although it was not as funny as I expected it to be, there was very little laughter in the threatre even from the children. However, it is a movie you can choose to view with your kids. Maybe those of us in the theatre at the time were a hard audience to please or maybe too many of us left our funny bones at home."
4,"Ratatouille, a movie for the whole family.","My family enjoyed this movie so much. Great entertainmnet for adults and children alike. Lots of action and even a couple of ""EEEYOU""s. One of my favorite Disney DVD's."
2,"Great pic, but story is terrible","1080p pic is great, however this movie could not keep my full attention nor my wife and our 3 year old daughter. I wanted to like this since it was my first blu-ray movie, but I did not. I resold it the following day."
2,Not appropriate for younger children even with G rating,There should never be blasting shot guns in a G rated movie. That constitutes violence to me. My 3.5 year old daughter got very upset and we did not even get to the wonderful parts because the gun scene appears within the first 15 minutes of the film.
2,"Great, great movie but DVD simply disappointing","Gee, I hope someone from Pixar or Disney reads this!What happened to those great Pixar Special Editions?!This is the second Pixar movie that I really enjoyed in the cinema and that I definitely will NOT buy on DVD!"
4,Superb picture & Sound,"Great BluRay - apart for the 10mins of "" loading & trailers"" . Picture quality up there with the best & 24bit lossless sound !Very well animated & mostly a great story & wonderful to watch. Maybe just 20mins too long, but very enjoyable & great purchase."
4,Ratatouille,"Pixar does it again with a magical story of a rat with gastronomic aspirations. The computer graphics are so well done with such attention to detail. The story line is really fun with great rapport between Remy the rat and Linguini, his human puppet in the kitchen. A dvd that will appeal to adults and children alike."
5,WHAT A DELIGHFUL MOVIE!!,"This movie was really fun!! We went to the movies to see it when it was first released in the summer of 2007 and my 6 year old son didnt want to sit through it because it was too LOUD..LOL Anyway, after much anticipation, we rented it on DVD and what a gem!! We've already watched it more than 10 times..it's one of our favorites, right up there with ""Over The Hedge"" ""The Wild"" and the entire ""Shrek"" series. This is a movie you don't want your children to miss...it teaches the simple truth; ""anyone can cook..."" Pick it up!!"
3,Great Movie -- average blu ray,"Much has been written on Pixar's wonderful movie, Ratatouille. I'll restrict my comments to the blu-ray.The picture, like all Pixar transfers, is pristine -- absolutely unbelievable. The Uncompressed LPCM audio is also amazing.HOWEVER, you must dive into the menus in order to select the Uncompress LPCM audio track. By default, you only get plain, old Dolby Digital. Given that the main menu doesn't even offer access to the Audio Options, I would guess 90% of the people out there have never really heard the brilliant hi-fidelity soundtrack on this Blu-ray. And that's a shame. I understand the technical reasons for making Dolby Digital the default. However, that decision, in combination with burying the audio options so far down is not cool. Since hi-fi audio is such an important aspect in home theater, I dock this blu-ray two stars."
4,Interesting Read,"This book won't give you specific setups to trade, but rather talk about more macro economic events and how your trading should revolve around them. Don't understand why the dollar has been in a steady decline for years or why gold prices sky rocket during times of uncertainty? Then this is the book for you."
3,Of all the books on investing........this is one of 'em,"I've read many, many investing books and trade stocks, options, and etf's. I figured that after the reviews this book would have some new, fresh ideas. The only thing I got out of it was the correct way to draw trendlines. Everthing else was pretty much the same stuff most beginner investing books have to say."
5,A comprehensive guide for the beginning trader,In this book one can learn the basics on how to speculate inthe stock market. The portion on technical analysis is bestsuited for a beginner. Mr. Sprandeo gave a good run downon Dow Theory and its relationships with the technicalindicators. A very readable book for the novice investor ora good refresher for the pro
5,Impressed,"The book is in really condition, and this make me suprised, I thought the book was just good to read.The only problem is the shippment, it is taking too much time to me to receive the book.Thanks"
3,Nothing special,"I'm sure people will not find this review ""helpful"" , which is typical of the masses. They hear what they want to hear, then blank out everything else because it is threatening information. Shrug.I am well aware of all the solid reviews on this book, so I keep thinking I've missed something in my reading. I gave the book 2 stars for content, 3 because it was [cost effective]. It is definitely well written by someone who has quite a track record in trading. The one chapter on Dow Theory, 2B, trendlines and trend reversals was the only one worth mentioning. The rest of the book is lengthy filler material. Some good, some bad, mostly ""average""."
4,Good Trading Book,"Trader Vic has some very interesting stories and some great lessons to learn about trading. If I was to make a list of the top 15 books that I have read on trading this one would be in it. Anyone will be able to understand the concepts written in this book. Trader Vic knows his business and through this book will shed some light on how he does it.In the book Vic tells how to spot a trend and discusses technical analysis. How to spot the tops and bottoms in any market. There is also a lot of detail about economics and what makes the system tick, which as he says he didn't learn in school. Moving averages, booms and busts, and how to manage risk and have a good business philosophy for consistant success are also part of this well written book of trader knowledge. He covers a great deal of useful information in a very compact form that is actually easy to read and understand. This is a must read for anyone in the buisness or for someone just wanting to learn more about trading."
3,It's okay....,"...gives you a ""street"" perspective on trading. There's some useful information in this book, but also a lot of useless information such as Sperandeo's economic theories (which are just plain nuts). If you plan on trading it's a good book to read just for the value of seeing how Sperandeo approaches it.I've read most books on trading and this one is neither exceptional nor terrible. Take from it what you will and apply it to your own knowledge."
5,"If your a beginner, its a must buy","this was the first how-to book I read in my attempt to educate myself on the fascinating world of daytrading. I felt blessed. My overall feeling is that this was a man who had achieved monetary success, and now was willing to share with the world many important hints in order to achieve a little fame. For whatever reason he wrote it, the first chapters opened my eyes into the magical world of trends, Dow theory etc... the later chapters are in my opinion Vic's attempt to put his philosophical mark on the world and offered me little, but man were those first chapters something!"
5,Great late nite music! the coolest,"I loved hearing this late at night, It really sets the mood for a cool evening. Love the vibe of the wjole thing! It's like a Goth Bernard Herman! Love ""Die""!"
4,Shark Has a Great Ear for Mood Music,"Great to see Shark supervise a soundtrack with a few of his friends. The soundtrack definitely sets a foreboding mood that mixes with the film's dark theme nicely yet is also a great stand-alone compilation for those not-so-sunny days. ""Die"" is a surprising standout from Starbelly, an unsigned Los Angeles-based band with a throaty female singer."
2,Child anxiety network's CD is better.,"I bought this mp3 because I thought my daughter might want a change of pace during her guided imagery meditation/relaxation time. This guy's voice was cracking in the beginning, and my daughter could not stop giggling. His voice did not seem to be a perfect fit. We use Child Anxiety Network's CD and they do a better job (Then again, the cd is also MUCH more expensive). Guess you get what you pay for."
3,The Tilset Inheritance,"We meet Ginny at the beginning of this story, her adult life is just beginning as she is finishing school. Living on a small island with her mother and father, she has led a sheltered life. She meets and falls in love with Jim.Giving that Jim is still getting over the death of his wife, he is not yet ready for a relationship and hints that Ginny needs to see more of the world. So to impress him, she moves to New York but has to return on the illness of her father. Jim soon realises that he is falling in love with her, but it is too late because she soon moves to london when she inheritates Tilset pottery.It took me quite a while to get through this... the story dragged on a bit but I think the ending kind of made up for it, say the last fifty pages or so, thought the ending was very unpredictable"
2,not for young children,"This book may be fine for older children (12+), but I read the section where Lanny/Jake is in the office with the principal and found it totally inappropriate for my daughter (age 9).Skimming through other chapters of the book, I found passages that were more suitable for middle school readers. I wouldn't reccommend this book for children under 12 years of age."
3,Book was ok...BUT.......,"The book was ok and without a lot of errors, BUT the CD-Rom accompanying the book wouldn't work with my Windows 95. I checked with a friend who also bought the book and he had the same proplem, but said it worked in another computer with Windows 98. I was very dissapointed at not being able to use the CD-ROM and ended up having to purchase test questions from another source. Not happy! Buyer BEWARE!"
2,Many errors!,The book has to many errors. On page 67 table 3-2 is not correct. On page 232 about the EP print process is not correct. On page 166 figure 7-6 is not correct. And so on.........When a CD comes with the book is could be good service to tell people that there is 17MB software on a 650MB disk!
2,A+ Certfication,I found the book very informative but it was filled with many typos and improperly labeled pictures. Many things were not explained and I was confused on many of the subjects. The typos made it really confusing at times and I found my self searching at times because of wrong answers on the tests.
4,"Good Collection, but would like more!","I have been reading this edition in the context of a university class. The notes on the text are extensive and helpful and the facing page translation makes for a quick and enjoyable read. However, for the purposes of truly studying these texts I would have appreciated having the middle english version glossed on the more obscure M.E. words to enable me to grapple with the original text and language a bit more. I am also partial to texts that annotate on the page rather than endnotes, as the constant flipping back and forth can become tedious, to say the least.Overall I was surprised how much I enjoyed these stories, especially Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. The translation of that was especially enjoyable, so much so, that I read it aloud to my children (5 & 7) and they loved it too."
4,Cobb grill is the way to go!,"This product offers ease of portability, a snap to clean, excellent out of the way fat drippings for healthy eating. I have already recommended this product to friends that enjoy camping activities--the carrying case with shoulder strap provides ease of portability."
2,SLOW COOKER,"It's very attractive, lightweight, top quality construction but not designed for the fast-order griller. You must take your time. Also has conflicting instructions as to whether to keep the lid on or not. We did and the burgers tasted almost boiled. I guess use your own intuition a bit. Cookbook can be downloaded from website for free or ordered from Cobb for $4.95 shipping (Cobb will not send via Media Mail -- it's our money so I guess they're not concerned about saving it)."
3,Poor choice of cooking surface,"It is easy to brush off concerns about the Teflon cooktop. It is well made with a durable textured feel. Ultimately though, Teflon should not have been used just a few inches from the heated charcoal. I thought these concerns were overblown until I experienced unpleasant side effects of flu like symptoms myself while using the Cobb that persisted each time I kept using it.When I finally realized it was ""Teflon flu"" and stopped using the Teflon cooktop, my symptoms abated. However, Teflon degassing can reportedly occur at 400+ F and is toxic to certain pets (birds). Long term effects on humans are not well known.Enameled metal, cast iron or stainless steel are the standard materials that every charcoal grill manufacturer uses. So this deviation was not ideal.The unit itself does cook well enough although it is highly susceptible to losing heat when there is wind even when covered."
3,Good for few single steaks,"Great to use if you're only grilling for yourself or two people. I'm not a big fan of the nonstick plate it comes with, it rusted fast. I do enjoy the grill."
1,"Cooks OK, but awful to clean","I bought this grill to use with my RV. I have cooked twice with it now, once a steak and once a spatchcocked game hen. They both cooked OK, and the cleanup wasn't bad with the steak (I remove most of the fat before cooking), but the cleanup after cooking the game hen for an hour was awful. The thing is a wh.. Uh, Horror.. to clean after cooking something with some fat for that long. Some of the bird stuck to the grill grid and was nearly impossible to get off even after soaking in hot detergent water for nearly an hour. I was using this at home as a try-out and used a large utility sink to soak and clean, and still had a hard time. It would have been nearly impossible to clean it properly if I'd been out in my RV."
5,"Works Great, Cleans Easy...We LOVE It","Quite simply, we've had nothing but wonderful experiences with our Cobb. Contrary to others, we've found it effective and inexpensive to grill on, and very, very easy to clean. The stay-cool exterior makes it snap for moving it around...very safe.So we're in the gang that would rate this with 5 stars, based on personal experience. We can't imagine why anyone would/could rate it lower, unless they simply didn't read the instruction manual before using."
1,Cobb Grill,"I was disappointed in this rather expensive grill and returned it. The fact that it was developed in South Africa might mean that maybe it's designed for people without much in the way of a fuel supply. It uses 8-10 charcoal briquets which is not a lot of fire. I tried to cook a couple of 1-1/2-inch-thick swordfish steaks and some vegetables. The veggies kept sliding off the nonstick grilling plate, which was annoying. I tried it with and without the dome (cover). I finally gave up after an hour (including a half hour to let the briquets get hot per the instructions) and took everything into the house and finished it on the stove. The same meal on my little Weber Smoky Joe, which cost about $25, would have cooked in 10 minutes or less."
1,Teflon Grill plate,"Received the great Cobb Cobber, Not so great, an aluminum grill plate with Teflon coating. I will not eat foods cooked on either aluminum or Teflon.It deserves a rating of less than ZERO!!!!!I was led to believe that it was ceramic!!! Bait and switch!!!!"
2,Cobb Grill Just OK,"I was disappointed because I could not get the grill to cook a whole chicken up to 170 degrees. After 2 Hours I gave up and put it in the oven.I think if you want to use the grill as an oven, it works OK. But, if you have multiple Items (Like more skewers than can fit on at one time) that require you to open and Close the lid, it will not retain the heat to cook thoroughly.I sent it back!"
4,Works best for bigger jobs,Slicer works great except for single page cuts close to the edge of the paper. It sometimes bends the page around the side of the slicer vs. cutting it cleanly.
3,Cuts very well,"I competed multiple cutting for entire school project and the blade is very sharp and cuts through construction paper 6-8 pages at a time easily...However, the pattern on the wood is 16th of an inch out of square and the metal bar is 1/32nd inch out of square.... I will be calling the company to get a replacement. Otherwise a great product."
3,Cuts very well. Rulers not precise,"This is sharp, cuts and trims very well, and seems sturdy enough for my uses, which are occasional but include matboard and adhesive backed felt. However I sometimes need to do precise trimming, as when connecting two parts of a template that contains multiple pages. Here it is necessary to join them properly to obtain a correct finished product. And this is where the lack of a precise 0 reference point is a real drawback. The rulers start with the one inch mark and there are no markings beween 0 and 1 inch. There is no easy sight reference, either--a red line, a triangle... one has to guess and then come at 0 in several increments. This is a pain and unnecessary. The end of the cutting board is not easy to see once you have paper over it. I'LL PROBABLY figure out a way to make a visible line but this shouldn't be necessary. Guess I could hcve bought one with a laser but didn't want to spend the money."
4,great little cutter,Great little cutter that works well for what i purchased it for. The construction was great for the price. No complaints and great fast service.
5,Office Must Have,"This is a wonderful paper cutter for the home office and craft projects. With the metal arm it is strong enough to properly cut multiple layers of paper at once and not leave jagged edges. Previously, I had a cutter with a plastic cutting arm that was just not consistently reliable. I am thrilled with this one!"
2,Swingline ClassicCut 15 inch paper trimmer,"This paper cutter appears to be solid and good quality, however it does a poor job of cutting paper. I've done some lamination work and bought this cutter to trim the edges of the plastic. The plastic folds down and I ended up using a pair of scissors. Paper cutting was not better. I would not recommend buying this product unless you are going to use it for cutting several layers of paper/materials."
4,Classic Cut Trimmer,"The size is just right for our museum work room, however it slides a little as it is a lightweight trimmer. Maybe a rubber mat below it will hold better.Thanks, M"
5,A Real Value,I purchased this trimmer for my new office and have been using it for about six months now. It has proven to be a true bargain and a real value considering the modest price. It cuts perfectly and accurately every time and should hold up very well even under heavy use. I'm very pleased.
4,swingline classic,"Used for cutting 10 mil laminating sheets and paper. I'm sure a really expensive one would work better, but this did the job without issue."
4,Works Like It's Supposed To...No Hassle,"I needed a paper cutter to do small jobs like cutting photo sheets and similar projects. Did not need anything really big time, just competent. This unit fills the bill just fine. I've cut multiple sheets with good results and even cut a piece of corrugated cardboard to make an easel for a mounted photo. No problems. Nothing fancy but sharp, clean cuts. Stays in place when you use it and conveniently, the cutter arm stays up between cuts. Solid machine much like the larger, similar units I worked with in the photographic industry. Recommended."
4,Good and sharp Paper Cutter,This paper cutter works nicely. The blade is very sharp and cuts effortlessly. The lever that holds the blade down when not in use is a good safety feature. Haven't tried to cut anything very thick on it yet.
1,Every cut is crooked,"This was a huge waste of money. Regardless of if the paper is sitting flush against the top straight edge, the paper cuts unevenly (at a slant) with the bottom portion longer than the top."
2,Maybe I got a lemon,"The assembly at the top of the cutter was not straight, forcing me to try and hold the paper still with my hand while using the printed guides. Also, the blade did not cut the full 15"". About 13.5"" into the cut and it started to bend and mangle the paper. Maybe I got a bad one, but I'm not trying another one to find out. For the record I was cutting single sheets of photo paper -- Canson Baryta Photographique. Perhaps the 15"" blade would be more effective on thinner paper, but that's not why I needed a cutter.Two stars because the thing actually cuts very nicely -- just not square to the brace or the full 15 inches. Obviously I sent mine back."
5,Quality,A real nice product that was delivered in a timelymanner. I couldn't ask for more than that. It looks like it will last me a long time.
4,This is a great cutter.,Purchased this cutter for our school. It is very sharp and works well on multiple pages. The teachers all love it. The base could be a little heavier as the whole things lifts up when trying to use it.
2,Won't fit under some doors,"What could there be about a rubber door stop that wouldn't work? Well, the thin end of this one is too thick to go under some doors. Without at least a bit of it already underneath the door, the door will just push it out of the way because it's not wedged under the door. Actually, the picture shows that it is thick, but I didn't pay enough attention before ordering. At $9, I will probably return it. I bought it for use when traveling for added security at night, but I'm afraid the door clearances will be too small for this door stop to be useable with the door closed. If you have enough clearance to get it started under the door (open or closed), it would probably work fine. It seems to be heavy rubber."
3,government rat,"What do you rate a good mob movie on. Maybe how it compares to Godfather or Goodfellas. No, you rank them based on the material in the movie and in this case I would have to say that they used alot of useless parts of this story and put it in the movie. They(mafia rats) all tell stories to make them selves look like the victim. But the truth about Sam gravano is that he was a stone cold killer and the movie gives you the idea that he was just doing what he was told. Not true, instead of puttng the courting of his wife, who left him because he was a rat and killed her brother, the movie should have focused on why he became a killer."
1,cheap case,"It is a cheap case, belt clip is not strong enough to hold on to your belt, every time i pull the phone out from my belt it comes out with the pouch"
1,Fell apart within 2 weeks,"I was really hoping that this pouch would hold up better than the leather ones I had previously purchased. Unfortunately, the seams holding the belt loop began to come off within 2 weeks of use; and I had to throw it out."
3,Guns In the Dark,It didnt work. The picture rolled throughout movie. The movie part gave great pleasure to an 80 year old man who loves westerns
4,Great Headphones Especially for the price,"The headphones are great. They are a steal at $9.99 exactly, no shipping costs(if you buy from Amazon). The only thing I didn't like about them was how they said ""enhanced bass"". There was really no enhanced bass, barley any better bass than the i-pod standard headphones. The reason i got these was because they said enhanced bass. Still, overall, very good headphones."
3,not as good as I thought.....,"While this computer is super fast buyer beware!!! it SAYS you get 250 gig HHD!! but you DON'T!! its only 222 GB and I KNOW windows does NOT take up 28 gigs of space!! I am VERY unhappy with this seller, I don't suggest trusting them!"
3,"Wonderful concept, uneven execution","Living in the San Francisco Bay Area, I was really looking forward to watching this video. I had seen a segment on TV talking about this artist who did the paintings around which the movie is based, and some of his life experiences that led him to do the art and make the video, and I thought, ""I need to see this.""Having seen it now, I can say, first, that the art is great. A wonderful combination of 19th and 20th century images and technology with lots of drama and humor. The writing that went into the narration was where I was a bit disappointed. From a story telling perspective it was choppy and often heavy handed.I watched it once, and maybe, someday, I may watch it again. However, if I had it to do all over again, I wouldn't have purchased the video."
4,Funny and touching,"Ideal reading not just for any woman contemplating graduate school, but also for those entering testosterone-filled workplaces... and anyone who has ever felt ""not quite good enough"" in a competitive environment. Skillfully told with plenty of humor in an easy reading style; no business knowledge required."
4,Truth about those 11 minutes,"This was a really good book. Paul Coelho is an outstanding author. Not his very best writing but a great look ay Sex, society and the person."
1,You can finish reading it in 11 minutes,"Someone had recommended this book to me because I had lived in Geneva. It felt more like an essay for a creative writing course than a novel. I can't remember the last time I've read something so superficial.Neither the setting nor the characters had enough texture to be credible or even compelling. The setting felt like any city on a lake. If Geneva was word searched and replaced with Chicago or Toronto, no one would notice. The characters are just as generic. Coelho describes the love interest as ""handsome and successful"" and the people at a party as ""smart and charming."" They lack the subtle details that make them come alive. Their insights into romance were weak.The least believable part of the book was the postscript where the author claims to have visited Switzerland on a book tour and met a few people who inspired the story."
2,Supermarket Romance for Spiritualists,"First, I read this as a book club assignment. Mr. Coelho writes this book as he has just only now discovered a few more tricks for his own sexual repertoire, and can't wait to expose them. An important character is conveniently based on himself (agent in Barcelona, etc...) which does more than signal a lack of creativity. My feeling is that this book, rather shrewdly, was written to appeal to his largest fan base: single and hopelessly romantic women. Bravo, Mr. Coelho, for a basic supermarket romance novel with a bit more deapth."
2,No intelectual challenge,"I was very disappointed, this being the first and probably the last book by Coelho that I am trying.Although I can understand where his success comes from, this is not my cup of tea.I like books that challenge the intellect, that leave you thinking long afterwards.This book is like a telenovella subject, not a very inspired or inspiring one.But, if you are looking for a fast read,some romance spiced with some sex scenes and sex philosophy, this is the book for you.The only thing that saves it from being a total bore are some scarce humoristical scenes and observations."
2,Not my favorite,"Eleven Minutes is not my favorite Paulo Coelho book. This is the story about a girl who fell into prostitution because she was poor and vulnerable and like everyone else in the world, looking for a better life. She fell into the trap. I didn't think this was any enlightening story about love and intimacy, more a story simply about sex.Linda C. WrightAuthor One Clown ShortOne Clown Short"
4,Surprisingly Different,I think this is a transition in Coelho's writing. It is the most realistic and adventurous of all his novels. Through it you can almost feel like you're wachting a movie. Loved the end...
1,Disappointing,"This is the second Paulo Coelho book I read, after The Alchemist but quite confused as to what the author is trying to say.Is this a reflection of the life of a prostitute or just a sex manual exploiting the female genitals?The plot is very simple. A poor Brazilian girl comes to Europe looking for money becomes a prostitute but her life being a prostitute is not so bad according to this book, filled with excitement and after spending just 1 year in Swiss brothel she earns enough money for her future. Her life then is well and fine. And what's the big issue with this female genitals..."
4,Worth a read,"This book was selected by my book club. I don't know if I would've selected it on my own. Although sometimes it didn't keep my attention...it only seemed to be ""slow"" for a page or so before picking back up. Most of the slow passages seemed to be in the diary entries. In general the plot was interesting. There were a few moments where it seemed a bit contrived. The writing is good and the main characters are well developed. It also reads quickly. A bit racy in spots, you should expect that based on the synopsis though!"
2,Annoying main characters. Not one of Paulo's best works.,I didn't enjoy this book. I normally enjoy most of Paulo's works but the main character was very annoying and wasn't written well. It was frustrating reading her preaching on a subject she knew so little about. I wouldn't recommend this book.
5,Amazing !!!,I can honestly say this has become one of my favourite books. It spoke about very relevant subjects that we all deal with on a day to day basis.
5,Another stunning novel from the author,It is a very good subject brought about the liofe of a girl who begins her life with another motto and ends up being a prostitute but also is not regretful about her decision.She accepts the life she is living and also how one day a painter maker her happy and make her feel good may be we can call it as non expressive love.This is a very good novel and I feel that every person with open mind and broad thinking would like this novel too.
1,"Dull, boring, predictable","Another book of Paulo Coelho that wants to be deep and original but is nothing more than dull and ridiculous. This is the last book I'm ever going to read by this author. I didn't read it in the original Portuguese, so maybe it's the translation, but this man can't write. His writing is much too simple (in his case it IS a disadvantage) and feels constructed, corny and artificial."
1,Another Deceit from paulo coelho,The book is superstitious and absurd. It says it speaks about sacred sex. But the content is nothing more than garbage. It compels the reader to think like a deranged person. Better stay away from these kind of filth.
2,Eleven minutes,"""Eleven minutes"" for people who read ""The Alchemist, is almost the same thing except Maria (the prostitute) is not Santiago (the shepherd) from ""The Alchemist"".For ""healthy"" adults who like underaged girls - this book is perfect. Coelho, writes about a 11 years old girl's sex life as if he were a girl himself! Then when this Maria is only 15, she discovers what Masturbation means and the way she does it and the way she feels when she masturbates, is vivibly described by Coelho - the writer I admired a lot.It's not a child pornography novel - that's what I like to think about it - but it surely must be when the sex life of an 11 and 15 yrs old girl is so vividly described.I definitely quit reading ""Eleven minutes"" for the reasons above and I was so grateful I have borrowed this book from the library and not spend my hard-earned money in a rude novel like this."
4,I enjoyed it,You cannot go wrong with paulo coelho books. I enjoyed learning about this poor girl working as a prostitute in Geneva
5,Should come with a Warning Label,"Okay if you are familiar with Paulo Coelho's work than you would be as shocked as I was when I began reading this book. Looking for a spiritual themed book, as he as written in the past, I was shocked that it was as risque as it was. That does not mean that it was not well written or a good read. It just wasn't was I was expecting. I applaud anyone who wants to expand their talents."
3,goth meets black,"just as the name suggests, dismal euphony hailing from up north and inspired by balck metal sorroundings, paint a bleak musical portrait on ""All Little Devils"". they are a blend of pop, goth, and traditional metal"
4,Building a Mystery,"In this book, Alex and Cam find out more secrets of there past, like who there parent's were. And Alex gets a crush! A guy like her named Cade who is hiding a dangerous secert. Emily and Alex don't exactly see eye to eye, and Beth keeps feeling neglected. Oh, yeah! And you are introduced to a new villan: Fredo! He's pretty dim-witted for a villan, but that's what makes him funny."
5,awesome helmet for sports,"i use the helmet for kiteboarding on the water, it floats, protects from wind and sun, its great armor for extreme sports like kiting"
3,For new apprentices,"Got this as a gift, had it on wish list, hoping to expand what I knew. Every tattooist has a way, a method, thought I'd learn from this video. Not so much. The subject actually bled, which bothered me. Not sure if Mr. Deakyne was nervous (I would have been) and that caused the 'baubles' in the tattoo, or what."
3,Black and grey,If you've watched any if the videos in this series then you know that these videos get repetitive. The quality and the actual work is great its just not really entertaining.
4,Great CD,"I am not an expert by any means in fusion music. In fact, I have only recently taken an interest in this type of music. However, at a friend's request I listened to this CD. Three days later, I bought it. Being a novice in this field, I may not be able to pick up on all the technical aspects of the music, but I can say it is an absolute joy to listen to this CD. Not to take anything away from the last three tracks, but the first two tracks are more than enough to make this a great album. I would recommend it to anyone who just wants to listen to great music."
3,If you like smooth jazz...zzz,"This is a pretty mellow outing, like much of the music in L Subramaniam's catalog. The music is soothing and melodic, but it never burns.I listen to a lot of global fusion and enjoy the new sounds that are unleashed when musical traditions collide. Although there is a good bit of fusion here, it never ploughs new ground.Blue Lotus is the one standout track. Harmony of Hearts, which could have been lifted from a Bollywood soundtrack, is the low point."
5,Global Marvel,If have the HDCD version of this album and seriously the Jai Hanuman rocks. This is one another marvel not just for Carnatic/Indian music but for world music.If Miles Davis would have lived long enough I am sure he would have elected to play alongside Dr Subramaniam.Splendid and magnificent must have collection for every jazz and Indian music lover.
5,Global Fusion,This is our very favorite album by Subramanian. We carry it in the car on trips and love the glorious sound and feelings it provides. We know you are going to love it if you want that international feel.
5,Absolutely wonderful ! Calming and happy,I had never hear of Beegie Adair until I heard one of her songs on the music channel of Direct Tv ( which is usually terrible) but when I heard her song I couldn't believe how calming it was.I bought this Christmas album and played it a dozen times and never got tired of it.My family loved listening to it during Christmas dinner.It's very hard to find jazz without all the brass that adds to the stress ...This was a wonderful gift.
4,Soothing Christmas music,"Jazz Piano Christmas by Beegie Adair is very soothing and comforting music. It is great to take a break from all the Christmas activity, and sit down with a cup of hot chocolate and listen to this wonderful collection of Christmas favorites."
5,"A great mix of contemporary, but not cheese-y, piano jazz","My husband studied at the Univ. of Miami in studio jazz, so in my opinion, he appreciates that this c.d. is not an insult to his musical intelligence; he doesn't find it boring. On the other hand, for me, I find it interesting and melodic, without being too cerebral, as some jazz albums can get (no offense:-). The c.d. has a great mix of upbeat tunes, that aren't overly-stimulating, with relaxing tunes that don't read 'somber'. My husband enjoys picking off, or trying to pick off, some of the tunes, but does find it disappointing that there are no transcriptions available (something on his list of things to do). In any case, one of our favorite Christmas cd's of all time! You HAVE to get this one!"
4,Very Good,"This is a very good jazz piano trio Christmas album. It includes a number of favorites, all done in a light and breezy style. I highly recommend it."
5,I recommend if you like standard piano jazz.,"Nice and mellow. I played it while on a long drive and the miles just flew by. No singers featured, just piano jazz."
2,Are you $eriou$ ?,"Charging $50 for a merit badge book is taking serious advantage of someone. Download the worksheet for free. If this were a collectors item I could understand. The used books are $0.75, just make sure they are current 1st. [...] is the official site for these books."
5,Best Brush Ever !!!,Have been using this brush for almost 15 years. I wish they were easier to find but at least I can order them online. They don't pull your hair and feel so good on the scalp. It's the only brush my daughter and I will use. Once you get one you'll never use another brush!
5,Best Brush Ever,"My hairdresser used a Phillips Light Touch-1. I liked the way it felt, so I bought one from her. That was in 1984. It is the only hairbrush I use other than a small round one for styling. It feels good to the scalp and it untangles your hair without pulling. I love it."
1,Snags,"Each bristle has a small, second bristle at the cushion. My hair gets stuck between these two bristles and snags. I have very thick and long hair. I can't believe so many people like a brush that rips your hair out. Very disappointed."
5,Philips Hair Brush Touch #1,This is the nicest brush. The teeth are strong enough to untangle hair without being so tough that they scrap against the scalp. My favorite brush. They also last a long time.
5,A BIT PRICIE BUT LOVE THE PRODUCT.,THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT. IT HELPS A LOT NOT TO TEAR THE ENDS OF THE HAIR. I HAVE TRIED OTHERS LIKE THIS BRUSH BUT NOTHING COMES CLOSE. WITH LONG HAIR IT SOME HOW DOES NOT TEAR THE ENDS OF THE HAIR.
5,This is a winner,"My sister has one of these brushes, and her hair always looks fantastic. She swore it was all about the Phillip's Light Touch hairbrush...now, I have mine! I LOVE it. It does make a big difference in making my hair look good."
5,Great for thick hair,"I love this brush, so does my entire family (husband, sister, mother, sis-in-laws). We have been using them for years ever since my mom bought us all one from her hair stylist. I have very thick, slightly wavy hair, and this brush gets all the way through it to the scalp, without being too stiff or abrasive on my skin."
5,Works Well,"I'm so pleased with this brush. My hair is fine and straight, and it tangles easily. After chemotherapy, my hair grew back curly for several inches on the ends. This tightly curled hair was something with which I was unfamiliar because my hair rarely had any curl. I jerked a lot of hair out trying to comb it. In addition, as my hair gets longer, the majority of its length is still fine and straight. Now ALL of it tangles a lot. I thought I'd want a boar's bristle brush, but I read the reviews here on Amazon and decided to give this brush a try. This brush is made in France, and I think the body is made of plastic. It has teeth (bristles? tines?) that are rather widely spaced so as to run through hair and not get caught very much. Yet it still seems to get all the tangles out. These teeth are tipped with little round plastic balls, so the brush is not scratching my scalp. Brushing actually feels good."
2,"Spend your money on a ""real"" pro!!","Being a tubist myself, I am always on the look out for a good recorging. If you are in the mood for someone who knows how to push alot of valves in not a lot of time, then this CD is perfect for you. It is full of it! Granted, there are plentey of lyrical phrases which are played very nicely, but to give it the title ""Virtouso,"" come on. You would be wise to spend your money on a Roger Bobo, or Sam Pilafian CD."
1,Poor by modern standards.,"I agree with ""Music Fan"".I'm sure Mr Morgan is a decent player but this recording does him no favours. The tone is un-focused and at times comes accross as un-melodic. What's with the breaks in the line in The Swan?? Changing octave mid-phrase is ridiculous. Many of the pieces simply don't stand up to scrutiny.Through history there aren't many tuba players I'd want to hear play a recital; Fletcher, Bobo and Jacobs come to mind.Consider what the most recent recording generation of tubists are putting out and it's another Solar System. Do yourself a favour and check out Mssrs Szentpali, Baadsvic, Sheridan and-so-on to see where the tuba's at these days."
1,"""virtuoso""? I think not.","While Kevin may be able to play most of the notes, there is very little music in those notes. Kevin needs to take a few music lessons from Pat Sheridan or Sam Pilafian. Music is an ART form, not a TECHNICAL form. Just because you can play the notes doesn't make you a ""virtuoso"".Spend your money on a Jim Self, Pat Sheridan, Sam Pilifian or ystein Baadsvik CD and listen to some true Master Virtousos. Not a wannabe."
5,One Of My Favorites,"Kevin Morgan's great, and his choice of music is wonderful-recommended in the highest terms!"
2,B-grade junk,"I wasn't expecting high literature when I got this book, but I still found it trashy and disappointing.The biggest problem with this novel is the battles. They're all one-sided, over very quickly, repetitive, and uninteresting. The Rebels always inflict massive damage while taking minimal losses, and every enemy is always in fear of them.What potential there is for moral relativism in having the main character rule harshly is squandered by having everyone else act much, much, worse. And don't even get me started on the far-right politics of it.Still, this book can be good for passing a bit of time if you can turn off your brain and just let it flow. Otherwise, don't bother picking it up."
3,Eye candy book,"I read this book while traveling through the British Isles. It's most definitely a chick book. It uncovers the details of a relationship that I would guess women would enjoy more than men. The prose is written in a very effortless style and the humor in the book often feels forced or contrived, especially the Amy chapters (eg. refer to her segment on working out). But its not a bad book; its certainly very light reading which requires little if no thought and somehow manages to be entertaining. But in the end the Amy character becomes overly annoying and insecure which makes you want to just skip over her chapters (which I didn't). Overall, its a harmless book which you won't get anything out of except some voyeuristic entertainment."
4,A lot of fun!,"I read this one in two days, I couldn't put it down. The format of the book is very effective in keeping one hooked. I was laughing out loud many times and reading out loud the funniest parts to my boyfriend. Compared to similar books such as The Edge of Reason and The Trials of Tiffany Trott, it's right up there with the best of them."
5,Come Together..Simply Entertaining,"This is one good book about relationships. I can totally relate with Amy..i understand her insecurities, her needs, her search for ""IT"". It doesn't matter if your man isn't perfect (who is! )..what matters is that he's perfect for you! Come Together also made me understand better how men think, why they're afraid of commitment and all that. I love both characters, the book's well written and presented (bravo to the authors). I even learned some Brit terms! This book's highly recommended :)"
4,One of the smartest books I've read all summer!,This book was simply hilarious ... people were giving me wierd looks on the beach as I laughed out loud! Lloyd and Rees totally capture all the paranoia and insecurities of dating in the 90's --- I challenge anyone in the twenty-something age bracket to say they can't relate! This book was just plain fun!
5,more fun reading for singles/B. Jones lovers,I read about this book in Glamour Mag and a friend told there was also a write up about it in Cosmo. So I decided it was worth a try. I'm so glad I did. It was so much fun to read. I felt I could relate to a lot of what they were going through in Amy & Jack's relationship. I laughed and cried for them.
4,Reminds you of the ups and downs of falling in love.,"A light, fun read that reminds you of the up and down roller coaster ride of falling in love. The ""he said/she said"" style keeps you always guessing how the other person will react. We've all been in ""Jack and Amy"" situations before, and this reminds us that there is a happy ending out there somewhere waiting for each of us."
5,Excellent Read,"Very funny, seldom have many books humored me as much as Bridget Jones, but this one ranked right up there. Wonderful weekend read, memorable characters!"
5,"please, please read this book","I am writing this review only because I REALLY want to encourage people to discover this book. It is profoundly funny and endearing. An immensely pleasant read, especially for those in their 20's and 30's."
2,"cheap thrills, no twists","This was a page turner. That's the best thing I can say with sincerity. Why all the oral sex scenes? Who knows. An editor would have been an interesting plus. Also the book jacket is ghastly, but I did get to the last page, so all in all not terrible."
2,Shallow and slow,"This book was so disappointing. I had visions of another Bridget Jones Diary. All the characters were interested in was getting pissed (drunk), getting shagged (laid), and smoking fags (cigarettes). They were all so shallow that you don't ever come to care about them. The happy ending consists of the last page and a half. Very disappointing."
2,A creative approach to modern relationship,"I liked the idea of alternating narrators with the passing of each chapter. This is a good summer read and unfortunately nothing more. If you have nothing else better to do and would like to have a an occasional smile and smirk then read this book. However, if you are looking for something to remember, this is not your best choice. The characters are a bit shallow, the plot is mediocre and the relationship described is nothing out of the ordinary, just like this book."
3,"Interesting concept, moderately well executed","This was a fun book -- a good summer beach read. It centers around the budding relationship of two people who just can't seem to get it right. The novel is told from a he said/she said perspective -- a clever concept, though the two authors' descriptions of the other character don't always match up. It's a fun, fast read, but I didn't find it particularly realistic or memorable."
5,You shouldnt miss it!,"It is such a fascinating book that you dont wanna stop reading though I am a bit disappointed, yet happy about the ending when Jack & Amy come together again. It's not just about relationship, it's something more than that."
4,"If you can't see yourself in this book, you're a hermit","I bought this because I was sick of being hooked on Terry Pratchett, Colin Dexter, John Grisham so I went for something off the wall. The style is superb, if a bit rushed at the end, but very funny nevertheless, and not just a chick's book!"
3,Predictable Fun,"Kind of a cutesy concept at work here, chronicle the fits and starts of a pair of London 20-somethings meeting and ""coming together"" via alternating chapters presenting the man's and then the woman's take on the relationship and events. Jack is rather unlikable at the start, being nicely set up both at home and work, yet content to mark his life's progression by the number of one night stands he can complete. Fortunately Amy is rather more likable and by the end we are rooting for the couple to stay a couple. It's a rather predictable story, obstacles great and small are overcome, misunderstandings abound, and transformation occurs. But it is often funny, and is perfectly harmless fun."
4,Stupid ending spoils this otherwise great book,"It's one of those books that you can't put down until you reached the very last page.But there's one problem -and it's on that last page. Ending spoils this very enjoyable book. It's predictable, cliche, rushed. The whole argument between Jack and Amy is stupid coz it's cleraly not his fault and yet everybody is blaming him and thinking breakup is a must.So, first 250 pages - page turner, gret fun.Last 30 pages - romance novel disaster."
3,Not representative of his other work,"I don't know why my original review disappeared, but it had gotten 1 useful vote.I got this book after having read lots of books published by Mr. Bodek's Productivity Press. Although this book was not what I expected, I still found it to be an enjoyable, autobiographical narrative. The sections dealing with an eccentric Shigeo Shingo were the best. Kaikaku is not a book that tells you how to turn your company around; it is an informal, easy-going history of how Norman brought Ohno and Shingo to the US.However, the poor production values (sloppy edits, inexplicable font changes, missed changes between block quote and normal text) were distracting. My warning to readers is that if this is the first book you ever read by Mr. Bodek, don't use this to judge the quality of other products put out by his former employer, Productivity Press."
2,ive had better,"when i first got this vacuumm i bought mainly for our basement and living area and bedrooms. Ive owned it for about a year or so now and it is worthless. The main problem is that the bagless area can barely hold any dirt what so ever after vacuumming three times, the bag is full and needs to be emptied. also the filter gets dirty easily too so i should've listened to my son. BUY a dyson its filterless. Sure the dyson is pricy but its worth it!!!!"
1,"If you have pets that shed, forget it!","This is the worst vacuum I've ever wasted my money on! I have to clean the filter EVERY FEW MINUTES while vacuuming (that is not an exaggeration!). This vacuum just cannot handle pet hair at all, and using carpet powder is out of the question. Buying bags for my old vacuum is proving to be less of a hassle after using this 'bagless', useless vacuum."
3,too pricey,"usually amazon is the best price but in this case, you can get it about $20. cheaper elsewhere, Lowe's for example.Good luck!"
1,was i retarded to buy this??,"i got this game one day hearing mixed reviews. it was only 19.99 so i thought hey it cant be that bad holding on to its price for so long. i was crazy. at first u like it because hey, its c.t.h.d. right? but you start to think as u progress that it is nothing like the movie. the missions have to have been made as an insult. the blocking system is ok but there is one combo block for every class of weapon. then u dont keep the weapons that u have in one lv. that is so annoying. then worst of all. u cant attack in the air!! when u glide u go sooooo slowly its crazy!!!"
4,"Di Meola, Ponty & Clarke Are Great Together!","What can you say? Three of the greatest jazz legends to come out of the '70s performing one of their first ever acoustic trio sets together! It was great! All three men were in great form all night with a set of songs that were still very new to them at the time. And they each did a solo number in the middle of the show...each of which were wonderful! My favorite was Ponty's solo version of ""Eulogy for Oscar Romero"" which included much of the beauty and grace of his original '84 version. The surprise inclusion of keyboardist Monty Alexander in a extended jam bit during the encore was especially enjoyable! Overall, this is a great DVD!"
4,Nice,"This is a great concert. I really enjoyed it. The sound mix is very good. Violinist Jean Luc Ponty is a great improviser and composer, intonation is often a little problem, but I guess it was his reference mix. Guitarist Al Di Meola is at his best, mixing the guitar and synth sounds and providing great solos and rhythm. Stanley Clarke is incredible, he really explodes with his instrument, his musicality is superb. The only thing I did not like (that's why I gave it four stars) was the inclusion of Monty Alexander, I know he is a good musician but he did not add anything good... I felt he had poor taste and an awful synth-piano sound, at least he could have used a real piano... To me he was out of place."
2,So Beautiful!,"I have this doll and she is really pretty. My cousin also has this doll. I love the necklaces and the ear rings are nice.However mine did'nt come with all the accesories my cousin's did!Oh well, she's so pretty!"
2,"A ""U"" Problem","I brought this bracelet for my girlfriend about two months ago, and she kept snagging the ""U"" on almost everything; her clothing, other bracelets, her hair, and even on me from time to time. Each time the ""U"" on this bracelet got caught in something, it'd slightly bend. Of course you can always bend it back, but after time, tension is going to cause it to just break off.If the person you plan on getting this for isn't going to wear it all the time, like every day, then yes, go ahead and get it for them. If you're quite sure they will wear it a majority of the time, I would suggest looking for another bracelet."
4,A new beginning. An old mystery.,"Cassie Hartt had never seen the ocean before and now it surrounds her. Her parents have split up, and she has moved with her mother and little brother to Kittiwake Bay, Maine. As Cassie struggles to adapt to life in the coastal town, she finds herself drawn to Waterview Manor, the mysterious mansion high up on a cliff. Though Waterview is now a retirement home, rumors of hidden treasure and passageways that were once part of the Underground Railroad swirl around the manor.Eager to learn more about the manor's history, Cassie becomes a volunteer. Before long, valuable objects are reported missing and everyone is a suspect. Cassie teams up with a new friend to search for clues, but as they dig deeper their investigation takes a dangerous turn. Can Cassie find the thief of Kittiwake Bay -- before the thief finds her?"
5,Mystery at Kittiwake Bay,"The book Mystery at Kittiwake Bay takes place by an ocean, at the end of a cliff, in an old mansion. The characters names are Cassie; her little brother, Danny; her best friend, Marc; and John who was pretending to be a friend, but really wasn't. Other characters are Cassie's dog, Sam; Liz, one of Cassie's friends; and two troublemakers named Sailor and Jake. This book is a mystery realistic fiction.Cassie is just adapting from moving away from Ohio to Maine. One event that was really funny was the part when Cassie's little brother Danny says, ""I want a cat.""Cassie says, ""You have Sam!""I think you should read this book because it doesn't make you say, ""What a boring book!"" Instead you say, ""Cool, terrific, enjoyable, mysterious book!"" I would tell you if your looking for book aim for Mystery at Kittiwake Bay!"
5,Prompt and as described,Excelent condition as described. This was the perfect gift for a friend who loves both the painter and dogs Thank you
2,Dull,"Despite its pseudo profound title, there isn't much here. The real title should be 'One Guitar, No Music.'"
5,Super Wonderful Leo,"I have been listening to Leo for many years and have owned a handful of his albums, but I only just recently purchased this CD. It is excellent, with all the warmth and fun and quality one expects from him. I highly recommend this CD. It is superb. It probably rivals ""Greenhouse"" for my all time favorite Leo."
5,True musical genius,"Morning is the Long Way Home and Too Fast; dazzling, amazing in performance and structure, but the tune Bigger Situation; what can you say about this stunning composition. As deep and powerfully brilliant as anything the human race has to offer. Leo Kottke, a musical artistic immortal."
4,All Guitar...No Geese Farts,"The title says it all. The album showcases Kottke's formidable fingerpicked guitar instrumentals, which are dazzling. However, despite his liner notes comment on his Takoma debut (which compared his vocals being akin to geese farts on a muggy day), I miss his deep, resonant vocals. But this is a minor quarrel against an otherwise excellent CD. While ""One Guitar"" won't make me forget ""Greenhouse"" or ""My Feet Are Smiling,"" this is a welcome addition to any Kottke Kollection."
5,Alice and I are both in chains,this cd is a great collection of works by Alice in Chains. I love the sound of the leads voice. Also the seller that I bought this from did not disappoint. The cd was in perfect working order. I don't purchase each and every cd put out by a group so this cd was a must-have.
5,Alice in Chains!,this album is a MUST HAVE for any Alice in Chains fans out there!All their best songs on one album - what more could you want??
4,Great Album!,"I started out as a moderate AIC listener. Then started seeing some video's on youtube and somehow became drawn in. I liked a few songs, and then wanted more. Although this album has a lot of their best, it doesn't cover them all, so this is a good starter or additional album, but would need to get a few more. I also purchased their unplugged album at the same time, and although i'm not a big unplugged person, i'd say that it is awesome."
3,Missing Some Essentials,"If it's not a mortal sin to call this ""The Essential"" AIC when it doesn't include ""Down In A Hole,"" it should be. That's not an earthquake I feel, it's Layne Staley rolling over in his grave!What's here is excellent, of course, but why include ""Sap"" (AIC's weakest release) nearly in its entirety when there's no ""Bleed The Freak"" or ""Down In A Hole?""Save your money and get ""Music Bank,"" or better yet, get all five of the original albums and EPs."
1,Alice in Chains - The Essential Collection,"Quit trying to cash in on this band already! How many compilations of Alice in Chains do we need, seriously? There is absolutely nothing here that you can not get anywhere else, and this release is completely pointless. The music is stellar of course, so my rating is based solely on the release itself. The choice and placement of tracks is just bizarre, like someone was just picking and placing them at random, I have shuffle on my CD player, I can do that myself, some semblance of order would be nice. Don't waste your money, you're better off picking up something a little more competant. FOR COMPLETISTS ONLY!"
4,Not quite perfect,"As is typical with Sony's ""The Essential..."" series, there are always a couple of essential tracks missing and this collection is no exception. Why in the world would they leave off ""Down In A Hole""? There's plenty of space for it on disc 2."
4,Decent Compilation,"They include almost of their hits on these two hits but they are no way ""Essential"". For some reason ""Down in a Hole"" was left off and they included the unplugged version of ""Nutshell"". Every compilation of AIC's includes only the unplugged version, I dont understand why, the studio version is much better. They also left off Bleed the Freak.But for the most part this is a great hits cd but it could've been condensed down to one disc easily.Mine would have been:1. Would?2. Rooster3. Man in the Box4. No Excuses5. Heaven Beside You6. Again7. Get Born Again8. What the Hell Have I?9. I Stay Away10. Nutshell (studio version)11. Down in a Hole (studio version)12. Them Bones13. Angry Chair14. Sea of Sorrow15. Bleed the Freak16. We Die Young"
5,Evoke The Spirit.,"John Wilson and The BBC Concert Orchestra do a stellar job performing the 17 pieces by Mr. Coates. The selections are eclectic, each evocative of a different period of time in twentieth-century England. This is a most enjoyable CD for any one who appreciates the works of one of England's finest composers of light classical music."
3,Superficial,Superficial and viewed from the point of people who had lost touch with reality. The danger and suspense was inflated. Most of the book dealt with the authors attempt to deal with cultural shock and coping with her hired help. BORING. Nothing substantial about the chinese/taiwanese people or their culture. The majority of the local populace was too busy surviving to pay much attention to the politics of the time. It was only of concern to the elite vested interests. I know: I was there.
5,Superb reading!,"This is the best Jennifer Wilde book by far. It's about Angela Howard, a School-teacher's daughter who becomes the toast of London on the stage of 18th cent. She even gets painted by Gainsborough, meets many famous people from that era and becomes wealthy. It is written from the piont of view of Angela and you would truely belive she was a real living breathing person."
3,Written by Thomas Elmer Huff,"Just found out this book was one of many romance novels written by now deceased Thomas Elmer Huff.The details of the historical settings were interesting.Something seemed to be missing, however.According to a People magazine article, Mr. Huff was not a happy romance writer. Sad."
1,are you kidding the worst book ever,please who in their right mind has the girl speak the whole story directly and think this is romantic or that the reader could ever possibly get into the scenes when she goes on and on i said then he said then i felt and i wore oh dear pure torture and to top it all off spoiler we were persuaded that she was better off with another dude when it was obvious she loved Hugh from the start omg run people run dont touch this mind boggeling boring numbing unbelievable let down!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,A romance that breaks the mold--and 1000 cliches,"What is fabulous about this book is that it dares to be different. There is no other romance like it. Since a previous reviewer has already given away the ending, it can't hurt for me to reveal more. No, the heroine didn't end up with the dark, brooding man who took her virginity, but instead with the man who became her friend and proved, over and over, that he truly cared about her--truly loved her. It was such a startling plot twist, that it threw me.BTW, use of the finger has been around for centuries in most Western countries; it is NOT a 20th century American vulgarism, nor is telling people to go to hell. This book also isn't set in Regency England. For instance, Thomas Gainsborough wasn't just a character in this book, he was a real person--and he died in 1788. Even the most liberal interpretation of the years constituting Regency England wouldn't have it begin until at least 1800."
1,What happened?,"Something has gone horribly wrong with the Count as he continues to release cd's. Each one becomes increasingly worse and more difficult to bear than the previous.This is absolutely horrible. Take a wanna-be Mariah Carey, or perhaps more suitable, a really bad Dee Dee Bridgewater, and back with the musical mechanics of Kenny G or the backing band of Lisa Stansfield. That will just about put you in the camp of this record. Absolutely soul-less r&b, straight out of your local dentist waiting room or elevator.Save your money on this one. If you want to get something decent by the Count. Go for his first cd. By far that was his ""crowning"" acheivement."
3,Back to Basics,"Unlike his earlier projects, which were more up-tempo and on the acid jazz tip, this album has a definite R&B flavor. This change of musical direction is similar to what Incognito did with their ""Beneath the Surface"" project. Because this CD doen't have the pep of previous Count Basic albums, it's a great album to unwind to. It's good to see a musician demonstration a wide range of talents. I'd recommend this album to those who know Count Basic's previous work and those looking to move in a new direction."
4,"""Trust Your Instincts"" -- Love at First Listen","""Trust Your Instincts"" is my first exposure to Count Basic and I loved it from first listen. Kelli Sae's voice pierces right through my soul, arousing many emotions, from sorrow to joy. This album is rich with soulful ballads; my favorite being ""Who's Gonna Wipe My Teardrops Away,"" ""Someday"" and ""Where Did Our Love Go."" Other favorite tracks are the upbeat and funky ""I Don't Wanna Wait,"" ""Richest Woman,"" ""One One 4"" and ""Living for the City."" I loved this album so much that I went out and bought every other Count Basic CD I could find! I highly recommend all of the Count's work!"
3,"The Count's first effort...""Life Think it Over""","Is a classic and I think Paul Legat (Basic) put all he had into that first CD. This is an occasion when a foreigner tries to repackage R&B to American listeners, and we should trust our instincts and know better. The instrumental tracks One One 4 and the title track are actually good and will grow on you since there is nothing much else here. Heavy Dose is a very tight production and Living for the City is a really subpar rendition- try to get a used copy of this if you must have it."
3,"The intentions and concept are good, but...","In some stores you will find a sticker ont the cd saying that if you are a Brand New Heavies and Incognito fan, this album is for you. The standard is high ! Perhaps too much for this album, which has some good to excellent tracks (the extraordinary ""1-1-4"", ""don't wanna wait"") and a cover version of Stevie Wonder's ""Living for the city"". ""Richest woman"" is an escapade into Brazilian guitar sounds. However, some tracks are too repetitive and get tiring after a while, even if most of those are only close to four minutes' length. So if you want to fill your cd collection with a good album, it's a good purchase. If you're looking for the best in it's genre, it probably isn't."
1,Boring,I tried this group out with this CD because I heard that they are doing good soul music but I was disappointed. Many cover songs in an Incognito-style. The girl sure has a voice but all in all I thought this was boring.
1,oh my!,my child hates this game and wanted to sell it. she is five and she beat it about 15 times now.I was watching her play and it did not seem like a kid could learn anything from a game like this
4,Elmo,How can you say this game is for 3 year olds! I am a teen and this is the best game! Elmo games rock.
1,Don't waste your money,"This is an unauthorized bootleg. It is available as a free download on the Avalanches' website (as ""Gimix"")."
5,Sega Dream Cast Controller,Just needed a controller when I gave the system to a little boy. Works fine from what I hear and I received the controller from the seller with no problems within a couple of days. Thumbs up!
4,Controller,It is a fact. Playing video games alone isn't as much fun as playing them with your sister or brother. The only reason I bought a controller was just that. It still works today.
5,Dreamcast...We hardly knew ye...,"The Dreamcast controller was made for the Dreamcast Console, duh. It was the last of SEGA's game consoles, and was too short lived. A great system, which could have had a better chance."
3,Also not a game.,"Well Amazon needs to update their review page, this is the second accessory that is not a game. I like it, works just like the original....oh wait, it is. :P"
1,Not attractive,"This product is not very good looking. It is like a worker's raincoat, the yellow kind, except in a very artificial blue. No pockets. I don't recommend this jacket to anyone other than a boater or hunter type."
2,not as described,"The item received was not what was pictured, entirely different style ladder bumper and even a different color. The vendor did however credit me my money immediately.....but they did not even have what they advertised. Wasted my time...."
5,Collector !,"This doll is so cool, great looking, and I must say the Red Hair looks great on this Doll."
5,Seeing is Deciving,"Cam and Alex are becoming very powerful with their magic, but Beth is suddenly feeling neglested. Cam and Alex caught a shoplifter with their powers. But as it turns out, the shoiplifter is the subsitute teacher! Cam meets Shane, a hot Warlock which is accosiated with Thantos. Thanto's traps Beth as an attempt to capture the twins. Fredo kidnaps Alex, but he didn't realise he got the wrong twin. Alex has to make a decision if she has to scrafice herself for Cam and Beth. And Ilena and Karsh are facing there own probloms when they get trapped by Thantos as well!"
4,Personality swap...a lil bit,"In this book, Alex seems more calm and Cam seems on edge. The twins seem to switch personalities here which is quite interesting. Also their uncle seems to want them really bad. And who is this Shane guy? Also, someone from Alex's past is back. Read the book and find out."
3,More of the same..,"Seeing is Deceiving, the third book in the T*Witches series, is a continuation of the first two books. The twins are forced to learn more about their powers, as their magickal guardians are unable to bail them out in their latest misadventure. Camryn, the ""sunny-side-up"" twin, is jeopardizing her friendship with her self-centered behavior. Alex is just as sarcastic and angst-ridden as ever, as she slowly adjusts to a life of plenty and security. The girls face off against the bad guys and do their best to save the day. Unfortunately, their personalities and their relationships with the secondary characters in the series are mostly ignored in this book. If you enjoyed the first two books in the series, this is more of the same..."
3,"Nice book, I guess","It's just not very interesting. Grandpa toad is teaching his grandson how to be safe in a world of predators - be brave and be smart. But before he can give the third tip, he gets attacked by a monster! Luckily, his grandtoad is there to be brave and smart for him and save the day, incidentally demonstrating the third tip: Have a good friend to depend on. Aw.There's nothing wrong with this book, it's just not that interesting."
2,Make sure you know what you are cutting!!!,"I had some thicker tile, but light glazing and it was a wall tile, but I suppose it could be floor tile also. It did not say floor tile. So, based on the tile package and Rotozip XB-TC1 Tile cut X Bit packaging, it sure looked like it should have worked. $12 at Lowes. I was cutting a 1 1/2"" circle for a pipe. Initial entry hole went well working it around as I went through the tile. However, it didn't even get me 1/2 way before it lost it's cutting ability!!! I was going slow and worked it up and down. I was ticked, especially since this is the second one I've tried. ($24 so far). Finally had to break down and buy the $40 thicker Rotozip diamond bit. Rotozip is great overall, just DO NOT USE this bit ON THICKER TILE! Hope my mistake won't be yours."
3,Perfect for thin stiff .... non-starter for thick stuff,"Used with RZ2000.The GOOD:This thing blew right through (cleanly) hardy-backer. Found that out after failed attempts using wood/drywall bits. Also goes though thinner wall tile cleanly and pretty quickly.The BAD:Try this on 3/8"" porcelain floor tile and you will ruin your bit almost immediately. If you need to make a really really (REALLY) small hole, this could do it, but plan to expend the entire life of a fresh bit on that hole. Or better yet, find a better bit or another option to get it done.SUMMARY: Great for light duty tile/backer cutting, worth keeping available if you are in a jam with something heavier."
5,RotoZip Is GREAT,Roto Zip and anything to do with it are the greatest things since sliced bread. This transaction and all my RotoZip transactions are fantastic. I'll buy again from this seller.
1,Another effort to get us to buy the same songs over and over,"Gee, this cd has five songs on it that were already released on Decade of Decadance, a ""re-mix"" of Hooligan's Holiday, and live version of Dr. Feelgood. So, that's a total of seven songs that you would already have if you (like me) own all the Crue albums. So, essentially I have to buy this cd just to get 8 songs I haven't heard before?? No thanks."
3,Another greatest hits,Whohoo another Motley Crue greatest hits collection. The only track worth while on here is only good song that came from the John Carabi era (if you can call it that) - Hooligan's Holiday.
1,GIVE ME A BREAK,"I don't know about anyone else, but I am really sick of NIKKI re-re-releasing all of this old music. It's more than obvious that Vince should be given control of this chaotic band."
4,RANDY CASTILLO?,"The person that reviewed this CD and stated that ""Randy is on"" on this CD seems to be confused... this album was released well before Randy was in the band (signed-on for New Tattoo) and many were recorded YEARS before the album was actually compiled.This CD could most accurately be described as a ""Best of B-sides""... many of these are Crue recordings that have surfaced previously on Crue albums (i.e. Decade of Decadence).This album is most fitting for only hardcore Crue fans that do not already own this material on other releases or bootlegs."
3,"IF YOU HAVE DECADE OF DECADENCE, SAVE YOUR MONEY","THE NEW SONGS ON THE ALBUM ARE O.K. I HAVE DECADE AND THE ALBUM QUARTERNARY. THIS ALBUM IS A DUPE OF BOTH. SINNERS&SAINTS IS A COOL TOON, BUT THE CRUE NEEDS TO COME OUT WITH A NEW ALBUM, WITH ALL NEW MATERIAL. MY ADVICE TO THE GROUP IS, GET TOMMY LEE BACK IN THE STUDIO AND LET HIM WRITE. WHEN THE BAND IS DONE WITH THE GREATEST HITS TOUR, START IMMEDIATLEY ON A NEW ALBUM AND GET THE RECORD EXECS. TO PROMOTE THE HELL OUT OF IT. GET TOMMY LEE BACK IN THE BAND!"
4,"What can I say it's a cool album, does Motley ever disapiont","Even though there are some older songs on it, the new tracks have some great feel to them. most of them are from the eighties, and there pretty cool. But the tracks off of Quartenary are really funky. All in all I think it's well worth the buy, if your a Crue head."
3,For diehard Crue fans & collectors only,"Besides the fact that a good portion of these tracks are available elsewhere, the couple new songs don't necessarily warrant buying the entire album. And even some of the previously unreleased tracks are not worth the download as singles. But if you are a diehard and longtime Crue fan, this will help complete your collection. Now, I'll go back to listening to the ""Shout At The Devil"" and ""Theatre Of Pain"" outtakes and demos I got my hands on that Nikki has yet to officially release."
1,Hummmmmmmmmmm,"I'm a performing musician and bought this pickup for a vintage archtop guitar. Since it is a passive pickup, I tried running it through my L.R. Baggs DI box, then to my Bose L1 compact PA system. It definitely caught the tone of the old guitar, but the humming was so bad, I couldn't stand to use it. It is sitting in its box in my studio and it will stay there."
5,WHAT A PICKUP,"I use this on my cello , ukulele and guitar. Awesome no background noise fuzzz or buzz killer pick up and a bargin considering it the work on three instuments. The only draw back will be finding stick to use when I run out but Ill figure it out. maybe that stuff that sticks stuff to junk mail Fast delivery"
1,would you like extra noise with your sound?,Bought this for my dulcimer after looking at the rave reviews. Maybe my ears are too sensitive compared to others but this sucker hums like crazy. I've actually returned it twice and both have serious AC hum. I ended up getting H&K pickups from Oregon and the sound quality is so much better and the derived SN ratio is much better. I wouldn't use this puppy for any serious recording but it does double very well as an amplified stethoscope =)
1,no good,"Got the stick on pickup and was so dissappointed I almost threw it away.There was no sticky stuff on it to attach to my guitar and was a total pain in the backside.This is a real waste of money.A two year old could have done better.I know what a pickup should sound like and this one is a disgrace., and should be embarrassing to dean markley.I will stick to Fishman pickups cause I know they sound good.Trying to save money with a cheap dean markley pickup is simply not worth the time or cheap price.There's a reason these pickups are cheap!"
2,eh...,I was looking to use this as a pickup for several acoustic instruments. The residue left on the instruments from the pickup is hard to get off. The sound quality lacks. There is no low end at all.
1,Must have... but...,"Early Sigma camera (SD10) does not charge in the camera. It requires two (2) of these batteries (or 4 AA). As the camera eats AA bateries and is unuseable, nearly, with them (get maybe three images before low battery - can reuse those AAs, though. Camera takes a small bite and rejects the still neaarly full batteries) you are forced to use the recarge type. They work fine.But the camera requires two of those and the recharger only charges ONE (1) (= 3hours). Set your clock to wake up and then charge the other! Or you need two chargers. Pictures don't show the plug (what goes into the wall) and so the charger looks small. Ha. Plug is huge. Two chargers. Bulky.A shame as the camera takes nice images providing that light is good."
2,Bad lid,"Now, I like Palmolive Dish Detergent. I don't know why, but it is one of the few detergents that does NOT cause a rash on my hands. However, I give it a two because I like the detergent, but I hate the new lids!! I'm filling up a bag of the broken lids. The lid that is in the picture is the good one, but the lid that is in the stores is awful. Maybe I will save the lids from my old bottles and see if they fit the newly designed bottle. I reuse the bottles so I still have some old lids. If Palmolive must have a new bottle design and lid then they need to start over."
1,Hate the drippy cap!!,"The detergent has always been my favorite, not least because of the color choices (I keep mine on the counter) but I will not tolerate this ridiculous drippy cap so I put the detergent into an Ajax bottle which still has the old style of dripless cap. Am I nuts?"
3,$7.45 shipping?,"What's up with the excessive price gouging on shipping?I'll take my business elsewhere if a vendor insists on charging me 5-10 times the real cost of shipping!I may have been born at night, but it wasn't last night!"
3,"Does the job, but","These are very nice, but the prices on all this type of product are out of control."
2,Disappointing,"Moran's watercolors were made on the spot to capture the true colors that he would reproduce in his well known oils. A watercolor painter myself, I have been very interested in this book for years. It has been very disappointing to find that it has only 10 color illustrations (and not good quality ones), and 50 b/w. (I had ordered this book before Scott's review was posted, bad luck). This is an information usually missing from book reviews or ""product detail"" lines, and I think it should be provided. It is the fourth time it happens to me with Amazon. Anyway, I think Ms. Clark essay deserves a better rating, but I usually buy art books for the color plates."
1,dreadful book,"This is a dreadful book on Thomas Moran, the colorist. Few illustrations in color. Those that are printed in color are compromised by the poor printing. Do not buy!"
3,Where's the Color?,"I've seen Moran originals in museums. They are delightful and the color is one of their primary appeals, the drawing being the other. Very few of the reproductions in this book are in color. That is a shame because it seems to be the case with most books about his work. He will never be fully appreciated until there are some good color reproductions available."
1,Major Disappointment,"I only wish I had read the earlier reviews of this dreadful book before I spent my money; I would have saved myself both cost and disappointment. The text is adequate but far short of the expectations set on the inside cover. The images are the worst I have even seen in a respectable book, they do not even rise to the level of a quality comic book.The paper is poor, the resolution worse and the color simply unprofessional, mostly mud.DO NOT buy this book!"
3,different and mellow,"This album is a little more mellow than other marillion albums, and the acoustic guitar is more abundment. The songs Man Of a Thousand Faces, Eighty Days, Estonia, Memories of water, definitely have acoustic guitars as a main instrument of choice here. The song One Fne Day is a bluesy song and An Accidental Man is the sole rocker onthe album. The album moves nicely. Good songs throughout but if you are going to buy your first Marillion album, get Marbles or Afraid of Sunlight."
1,Not worth it,"This is promotion DVD for a variety of artists, only a couple of Cliff Richard and the Shadows. This is not a concert. The title is very misleading."
5,A great compilation for Austen fans on the go!,"Helena Bonham Carter was the perfect choice for the narration of this compilation of Austen excerpts. Her changing levels of tone and speed keep the dialogue realistic, and Austen's beautiful character descriptions are only heightened. There is one 9-17 minute excerpt from each of Jane's major works: P&P, S&S, Persuasion, Mansfield Park, Emma. Between each of the readings are lovely samples of music from the Victorian era. A lovely mix of music and literature. When the music begins, one may envision the lovers discussed in the previous reading dancing to the tune in a candlelit ballroom, right out of the book. Since it is only one disc, and it is so varied in style (from the snakelike scene between Elizabeth Bennett and Lady Catherine to the romance between Anne and Frederick), it is great to keep in the car for a short trip, or for a quick fix."
3,The storybook--disppointing,"After seeing this very enjoyable movie with my 4-year old, I was really looking foward to reading the story and relive his favorite moments of the movie. Yet the book was a disappointment. My main objection--it is too long. 96 pages of sometimes too literal transcription of the dialog in the movie dilutes the story as not everything that seemed fine in theaters is worth putting on paper. Second, the pictures are low quality dark screenshots of the movie--you would think that turning digital animation into high-quality prints would not be that hard, but alas. Finally, there are some moments included in the book that never made the official cut of the movie something that was confusing to my son.Not beeing a huge Disney fan, I must admit that the book adaptations for their features are much better--concise and to the point, managing to convey the main idea of the film (if there is one)."
3,"RAverage Player, Decent Radio, Instead, go Panasonic","This model is one of the 2 Sony Discman players I own currently. The player is nice in that it has the Groove sound equalizer...as far as I can discern, Groove balances things out and makes it really bass-y, but not OVERLY bass-y. Megabass is for those that want to DROWN THE SONG OUT...instead of hear it, Groove is a lot better. The radio is great, IN MOST CASES. Your antenna is not only the headphone cord, but YOU...so sit nice and it works okay. I found that the Walkman cassette player/AM FM player that Sony makes has a better radio. Since then, it's nothing but that for me, so the cd player sits on the shelf currently. If you want a great quality cd plater with radio, do what Topher would...get the Shockwave player, Panasonic brand. It's muy more expenisio than this player, but it's damn well worth it. (think around $175.00 or more.)"
2,Needs to be updated,"I have had this discman for a few years. It was great when it came out, but now it's really outdated. It's bulky, and the 20-second anti-skip is pretty poor relative to competitors. You cannot jog with this. It also eats through batteries pretty quick. The rechargables wore out after about a year and had to be replaced. The radio feature has good reception and works well. The price on this is way to high for the level quality available from other cd players."
1,Disappointed with quality,It felt cheap! I expected rock solid quality and craftsmanship. The lid wiggled when closed and the buttons were cheap. I returned it to the store for my money back! Stay away from this discman!
3,discman,"i ordered a used discman so far so good even though it did not come with earbuds as displayed in picture nor instructions, i guess u get what u paid for"
5,Wow!!!!!!!!!,"Read it! It teaches you how to make money, drinks, friends and alot more. Even if you dont think you need help on growing up, Read it and you will be the best possible! girl ever!!"
5,Much too good for kids; parents won't be able to put it down,"I love this book! A boredom buster without peer, the GIRLS GUIDE has more cool things to do, look for, play and make than any book of its kind I've seen since I was a kid. It manages to be witty and informative, even educational, while never talking down to its readers. My kids love this book - BOTH the boy and the girl! A perfect gift book for any age from 6 to 14."
2,Okay for the younger girls...,"This book is ok for a few things, but for girls 11+ it just wasn't telling us anything we didn't already know! It delt with cooking the basic things, making money the basic way, and games to play. This book didn't explain much, but if you are a girl 7-10, it would be really great."
3,It's Okay A little young and immature.,"The book did not give a clear description about the age groups. I thought it would be for someone around the ages of 14 and up. It was pretty imature and I thought that it was more for 10 year olds than 14 year olds. We need to learn about sex, and drugs, not how to make lanyards."
5,Great product,Very good product works great! Would recommend to everyone but they are hard to find this model
4,Okay,I think this is for those that cant do sit ups on the floor and are just getting started. I have been doing sit ups for years but its starting to hurt my back. But I don't think the ab lounge is as efficient. I wish they had cords you could by that had more of a resistance. Oh well...you live and you learn.
3,Works but not for me,"This is a good product.I felt the burn instantly and is actually not a dreadful workout.Eventually I got ""bored"" because I prefer to do elliptical, stationary bike and dance, you know, workouts where I am not laying down but standing, running, dancing and such.I now have stored it under my bed as I do not have sufficient space to keep it out. I wish I could keep it out, maybe in front of the TV to put it to use but like I said, I lack space.This is a great exercise product with an excellent 'lounge"" chair feel.Very comfortable while watching television. Queeze a lil' workout into the routine!"
5,Love it!,I absolutely love this thing! It's so easy to use and was even easier to put together. It works great and you don't even feel the pain til the next day.
3,"It has it's PERK's, BUT....","Its great on the abs, BUT.. within the first week i had it one of the foam handels RIPPED OFF, im petite so i have only but so much strength to rip something thats obviously bound to break sooner than later. Also because its constantly opening and closing when using it one of the bolts came off by the medal handel.It's really hard to put back on and ever since it has twist off it hasn't perminantly stood on...i haven't even had it a month. Its not worth paying more for the ultra when you could just get the first one."
3,Smells like moth balls and parts missing,"I believe this is more a supplier issue with this product. First of all I have it, thanks. But it smells like mothballs! I am airing it out. Also I got some things included that I did not order , the computer piece, and the cables for the arms. IT DID NOT include the top handle straps and the top band to slip arms under, as I had seen and used on a friends same product.That being said, its sturdy and a good workout. It just needs to lose the moth ball smell...and can you send me the missing items?"
2,BETTER OFF BUYING FROM A STORE,I received my order very quickly but when I opened the box I can see broken pieces of plastic. I realized the broken plastic was the knob that is used to hold it open and removed when it is to be closed and stored.I was able to use it with pliers I just won't be able to close it all the time it's not worth the effort. After using it twice I noticed the top half of the chair is bent and the cross strap is broken.I wouldn't make a purchase like this online again. It's not worth paying to return to product and waiting for a replacement.BUYING SIGHT UNSEEN IS NOT A GOOD IDEA.
4,Ab Lounge Ultra,"I am very satisfied with my purchase, now I just have to find the time to use the product on a regular basis!"
4,"A Very Good product,,,,","The product was delivered quickly. The assembly was easy. Although I do not use it everyday, I have still noticed a difference in my core strength. I have had back problems for a number of years and thought it might be of some benefit. It is a great benefit. Speaking as a person who had a ruptured disk, take it slow, and you benefit from it. The negative item is the overall length for a tall person. The body length from the hips up could be a few inches longer. Don't think you are going to pound out a few hundred crunches and have AB's like a 6-pack. Take your time and pace yourself. You will enjoy the product and not burn out on it."
3,Ab Lounge lacks something,"I was under the impression that the Ab Lounge I purchased was BRAND NEW. This was not the impression I had when the product actually arrived. The hand bands at the top of the chair clearly had some wear on them, and although there were warning labels regarding product use adhered to the frame of the lounge, there was no instruction booklet included to advise about the use of the product. The only written instruction included in the packaging, at all, was what appeared to be a computer generated list about how to assemble the lounge. The lounge is not easily put away, either. It is cumbersome and takes up a good bit of room, making it difficult to refer to the lounge as ""convenient."""
3,Works well - but not the best of craftmanship,For an older gent as myself - this is one way to get a decent ab workout without getting down on the floor and struggling with normal crunches. The only issue I have is that you can tell the material will give out after a while as it makes a lot of noise when using the lounger. The hand strap also broke after a couple of months and its makes it hard to grab on to anything when using. Folds up pretty well - but not quite as easy to get out of the way as you are lead to believe.
4,Great way to get started,"I picked this up to aid in getting back in shape, crunches and situps were rough on my back. At first i was skeptical, but became pleasantly pleased as it does work. Don't expect miracles, but after 2 months of use i can definately see some results. My only complaint is that after a while it starts getting TOO easy. I feel its a great way to get started in building/toning stomach muscles, but once you have a good base it over-assists ...if that makes sense!"
4,AB Lounge Review,"This was a replacement chair for one that I had used for a few years. So that speaks to my satisfaction with this product. It's very effective and I have dropped pounts and inches, by using this product. And I have tried everything out there, and this works the best for me. I would highly recommend this product to anyone that is trying to take inches off of their midsection, the safe and effective way. This protects your back and neck and insures proper technique, for the maximum results."
4,A overall good CD,"This CD wasn't at all what I expected, but it's still great...The only songs I skip are Unspoken Words, Second Chance and Someone, but the rest of the CD is great!"
4,"It is so fun to listen to, it pumps me up!!!","I saw these guys in concert at the House of Blues in LA last week, they kicked so much ass. It was rad. I hope these guys make it big, because they definitely have the potential!!!"
5,The best band ive ever heard,"This band is sooo awesome. I heard them when they played here in buffalo. I love the lyrics and love the music. I think Chris Envy is probably my favorite new writer. Oh, chris envy is chris Messer so he did write those songs. Anyways, if you like weezer, waterdog, or greenday at all then you'll love showoff."
3,cool beans,"o.k. they sound like green day(even barrowed the riff from welcome to paradise) and yeah, they ound like goldfinger and they can be (the anti-song) generic, but, they gots a good sound little bit punk, little bit ska, little bit buzzcocks, elvis costello , bouncing souls"
2,u call this punk?,"i bought this cd cuz one of my friends said that i would like it, and said that they were way better then mxpx which is my favorite. i was so dispointed. i was hoping for good punk. most of the songs depress me. well dont buy this cd if u are looking for good punk"
4,great first effort,"Finally a band that is. Showoff has shown with this formidable and entertaing debut that they are a force to be reckoned with. With a little road work and some studio experience under their belt, this pop foursome has the chops to develop a large following."
2,Shiny Showoff Shimmers Shallowly,"It's fat-free decaf Green Day light, innit? The revolution will be televised. Elsewhere. But surely the teenie boppers won't notice. It sure LOOKS cool, though. Silver ink is just too damn sexy. Godspeed, little band."
4,Gets the job done.,"Plenty of power. The sound is a little bright for my taste, but for the price a fine speaker. Easy to install in my boat in the old speaker holes."
3,Cheap sound for a cheap price!,"I you just like loud music,these are the speakers for you. If you like quality sound, spend more and get some CEA-compliant brand speakers."
1,Be aware of your measurements,"Please be aware that the speaker states it is a 6.5 inch speaker, but the opening it requires is 8 inches. Do not be fooled. I had purchased two sets, and was whacked with $15.00 in return postage. This is not a bargain."
2,Inexpensive but still not worth the money,"Don't waste your time and money on this model and brand. After going through a careful and time consuming install, even taking in consideration the acoustical limitations of the space, on a scale of 1-10, I would give them a solid 4. If you are about sound quality, look elsewhere ..."
1,One good one bad,I bought these speakers about two months ago and had them in my house then i installed them into my camper they worked for about two dayd and one sent out and never worked agaiN but the one that works sounds good
1,Not as pictured,"I wanted a neat tapestry and loved the dark green color of the image. However what I received was a very light colored turquoise cloth. The designs are not very preferable either, with large cheesy looking heads."
5,This is valor's best album!,"It has to be said. I heard ALL THE LOVE ALL THE HATE, and threw the thing in the garbage. It just plain sucked so bad that I refused to listen to this band. After undergoing therapy, I heard ONLY THEATRE OF PAIN. Then I realized that VALOR was to blame for my pain and agony. Well, after hearing PORNOGRAPHIC MESSIAH, I have come to the realization that valor isn't all that bad. ""SHE NEVER WOKE UP"" is currently my fave track. Just a warning, DO NOT PICK UP ALL THE LOVE ALL THE HATE!!!! YOU WILL BE SORRY!!!"
5,"A welcome surprise, a feast of dark sexual energy.","Pornographic Messiah is the disc that should have been done years ago. The female lead vocals are back on some songs and the male vocals are alot better then on the previous disc, Prophecies. Then theres a cover of Sex Dwarf that is just soo well good. I won't even go into how great the liner notes are. This may be their best disc ever."
1,Reflections of Valor,"[...]Seriously, this is terrible stuff. Christian Death albums used to be works of art. This is hard rockin' crap extraordinaire, coupled with Valor's bad lyrics which are meant to be shocking, but which succeed only in revealing that Valor has bad taste (-- or to put it another way, he has no regard for good taste). Forget about art, go for the shock! Such is the way of Valor Kand in the new millineum."
5,best christian death release,"this is by far the greatest christian death album ever recorded. For those who think valor isnt any good, they should pick up this album. It is a great journey through darkness. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to hear something dark. Buy this album. Do not hesitate. Just go out and buy it. You wont regret it."
4,Hang On - This is a Good One!,"This is my first Pete Hautman book in some time and it was well worth the wait. I enjoy books that involve gambling and are well written and this one surely qualifies. It is right up there with James Swain's numerous books involving Tony Valentine.In using Patty Kane as the narrator, Hautman does a difficult thing. I could find no place in the book where I felt ""Peekey"" as she is called, was anything less than authentic.I spend half the year in Tucson, so I was familiar with the venues she described which were not fiction. However, the Casino Santa Cruz has yet to be built (which is probably a good thing) and while Hautman may live in Minnesota, he has certainly spent a fair amount of time in The Old Pueblo.If you like a book that is fast paced, has a lot of interesting characters and spins a yarn that keeps you turning the pages, this is for you. I loved it."
1,Not worth the time!,"This is the first book by this author that I've read and I won't waste my time with another of his ""mysteries"". There was NO mystery in this book. There was no real direction to the story. It seems that Hautman added numerous filler stories because his main concept was so weak. The characters were barely believable and incredibly stupid. The main character was so pathetic. Hautman has no idea how to write a woman's character. This story seems to have been written for an adult market in a child-like fashion. It had no twists or turns in the plot and the ending just stopped. You know when you read a really good novel and you have that feeling of contentment, like you were glad you took the time to read the book. Well, after reading ""THE PROP"", I felt like I wasted my time. The book got tossed it into the trash where it belonged. Reading should be fun and entertaining - this book didn't come close to being fun or entertaining."
3,It was sweet,"Sweet movie. Not too complicated, very good music. You'll enjoy it - Salman at his best - Watch you won't be sorry it's Bollywood"
5,wonderful,"i am new to indian movies.this was 1 of 2 that i bought.i was really surprised,the acting was great.ajay really sold me.i will be buying more.i am now a big fan"
3,OK,"I like the bollywood movies but this one didnt catch my interest. I loved ""I Have Found It"" so much more."
3,A bit of a letdown.,"Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam has some charming moments and occasionally stirring performances by Aishwarya Rai and Ajay Devgan, but I found it disappointing overall. Maybe my expectations were too high, given all the critical fanfare. Maybe my perspective was tainted by having watched Devdas (by the same director) the night before. Now THERE is a sublimely gripping tear-jerker! Anyhow, I never quite bought into the Sameer-Nandini love story in this film. Not nearly as fake as its ersatz Italy, but unconvincing nonetheless."
2,Typical Bollywood fare but English voice-over does not work.,"The movie is typical Bollywood fare. It is enjoyable, but nothing special.My only complaint is that you cannot play the movie in the English version--even though it is a choice offered in the setup. However, the English subtitles do work so English speakers can understand the movie.(Of course, the songs are not in English or with English subtitles--as I expected. No disappointment there. Songs don't translate very well)."
2,Amazon didn't ship what the website says,"I expected the movie to be the widescreen edition, but it was the fullscreen edition.I received this movie several months ago, but only just realized that it was Amazon's mistake, not mine. I'm truly disappointed in Amazon's service on this film.As for the movie itself, it was lighthearted and fun, but hardly a Bollywood classic. A better rental than a purchase."
1,Boring,"This movie is too long, makes little sense (songs are about flying a kite and a lemon) and must be intended for young children. The music is OK, very Indian, and I see lip sync problems.The plot is typical, and the sets elaborate. I hope nobody believes this is really India. It is overdone with choreography too obvious. This movie is boring."
5,Stunning Tear-jerker,"This movie is an absolute triumph. It has the most beautiful musical sequences in the elegantly lavish style typical of director Sanjay Leela Bhansali. Even though I can't stand Salman Khan most of the time, his quirky, arrogant style is somewhat subdued in this movie and works perfectly for his character, while Ajay Devgan as the loving, self-sacrificing husband makes you just cry. When I first saw the movie, my initial reaction was it was so good I hated it. The emotion and genius were too much for me to handle all in one go because I'd never experienced something so powerful before. Now I realize the brilliance of it- it is truly a classic that everyone should experience. Aishwarya Rai's performance is very good, and I think her best work is in the song ""Tadap Tadap,"" which will have you so blinded by tears you'll have to watch it over again to catch all the beauty. I can't say enough about this movie, so I'll just end on this note --This is an absolute must-experience film!"
2,"It's alright, I suppose","Vehement, angry, and Middle-East political. However, it's quite often loud and raucous rather than good music. My favourite tracks are ""Radicals"" which has some excellent sound-bites, ""All Around the Watchtower"" which is NOT a cover version of anything, and ""Police State (Mutual Blade)"" which manages to engage the anger into some powerful and moving music. It's up to you whether you buy this. I'm happy I did, but it could have been so much better."
1,a really poor attempt,poorly written. i'm talking about the author's use of English; extremely confusing. and that's before we even get to the jargon.
3,CONFUSING,"This is a decent book for someone trying to get and overview of how quantum computing works. The author seems to get bogged down in the details, however. The mathematical examples are poorly worded and thus not very clear, the variable names are also quite hard to keep track of.This is certianly a book where you will have to read certain paragraphs two or three times to make sure you have it right."
2,Give me back my equations!,"This book reminds me of Stephen Hawking's ``A Brief History of Time'', in that it consciously and conspicuously omits mathematical symbolism beyond high-school level. IMHO, this is a mistake, as it renders the material opaque, thereby serving neither the amateur nor the professional. Although it's almost heresy to say so, Emperor Hawking's book had no clothes.Although I have some knowledge of mathematics and quantum mechanics, the tiresome translations of concise expressions into long-winded textual explanations left me confused and bored. I feel that the lay person will also skim over them as completely as if they had been the original formulae.That said, the material is important, as is expressing these concepts to a broader audience. The book is well-organised, and deserves more work. I humbly request a second, edited edition."
1,Very confusing,"Mathematics was invented for a reason, and the avoidance of even simple mathematics makes this book near unintelligible. Further, the habit of versing quantum theory in terms of genetics, real and imagined, further separates the subject mater from the reader; and giving Feynman credit for how probability amplitudes add would probably not please him at all. Give this one a wide berth and read instead 'The quest for the quantum computer' by Julian Brown which is everything this book is not."
1,skip it,"One of the most glib and inaccessible treatments of the subject I've encountered. You're much better off with something like Julian Brown's ""Minds, Machines, and the Multiverse"" or Feynman's own lectures on computation."
3,Decent bridge between quantum mechanics and computer science,"Is meant to be for the lay-person, but unfortunately Milburn isn't as good at exhaustively explaining the bizarre world of the quantum as, say, a John Griffin. This book is more for people with some understanding of both computer science and quantum mechanics, as this is a nice explanation of where they converge. You can't quickly gloss over both disciplines and expect to have your readers understand them, but that's what Milburn tries to do. However, for what I needed, it delivered."
1,A very ordinary effort,"This book does not take you through quantum computing in any logical way. The author does not explain where he is going with his lengthy examples in each section. Instead he tends to launch into hard to follow, artificially concocted examples with little rationale and then move to the next topic without a conclusion or a reason for why he put the reader through such boring experience. The discussion of the Bohr - Einstein debate told me nothing of what the debate was about and there are many references to the EPR without any real explanation of what was in it. There must be a better way to understand this subject else I will have to conclude that Einstein was right and God really does play dice. Give this book a miss... it is simply not worth the effort. Even my one star is generous."
1,Not a programmed text,"The title sounded very promising. Following this ""programmed text"" was very frustrating. Texts like this give programmed instruction a bad reputation. I would not recommend this book."
3,like it,I didn't realize that it costs just as much in the store near by where I live. Now I just get it from the store then I dont have to wait for it to be shipped. Check the price at your store first to see if they carry it and how much it costs. I get mine from walmart.
4,A pain to use,"These inserts certainly work, but I will say that it takes longer to install them than the Drop-ins variety. I've not had any trouble with the Drop-ins leaking like some other reviewers (yet!!). I can see they will be easier to travel with since they are flat (as opposed to the drop ins which are round). I think I will keep both varieties on hand since they serve different functions."
3,OOPS,"I thought I was buying the drop-ins when I bought these. I didn't even know they still made this kind. On the plus side, they are highly portable due to the fact that they are flat plastic bags and would be easy to tuck in a diaper bag. On the negative side, you can forget trying to measure water in these, I have to use a glass measuring cup and just pour in the amount needed which takes away their portability. Recently when I took some of these with my baby while traveling I had to pour my required amount of water into plastic bottles with lids which takes away from the liners portability to say the least. There is also no way you could get a full 8 oz. of water PLUS your formula into these liners which leaves me having to feed my baby 6 oz. then running back and pouring in another 2 oz. So, these work in a pinch. I will not be purchasing them again however. Leave it to me, the bargain shopper who buys in bulk, only 2 more boxes to go....."
3,It's dark alright...,"The book is long on atmosphere and attitude but the actual story is pretty ordinary. There wasn't that much interaction between Batman and Deathblow, reminiscent of De Niro and Pacino's non-confrontation in Heat. It could've been great but in the end, it isn't."
1,"Boring, confusing and petulant noir","The story's dull. The scenes seem repetitive. The resolution and the time jumps are confusing and poorly indicated. Batman doesn't seem so much dark and driven as harried and annoyed. Don't buy this one. It's from the ""if it's dark, it's brilliant"" school of Batman comics; I thought we got over that in the mid-90's."
3,pacific crossing,"Pacific crossingI recommend this book to the people that like karate and people that like books about things that they do in China. In this book there are two friend named Lincoln and Tony. They live in San Francisco. Their principle asked them if they wanted to go to Japan, and they said that they would go. So they got on a jet and met two families that they will be live with for a little bit. When they got there they met the families and then got to work in the family's land. There was one other boy with Lincoln named Mistuo. They were friends for a long time. They learned many things about Chin. And their way of life they also went to school there and after 6 weeks, the two boys went back to their families."
3,Kinda messed up...,"First off, I find their desire to place untitled tracks between the listed tracks with no mention of this to be rather annoying. You have to figure out which song you're listening to by consulting the lyrics in the liner notes (fortunately they printed them!). The songs themselves are either too long (with too long of lead-ins to the vocals) or too short. To round off this Goldilocks-esque complaining, yes, some songs are just right. One of these, ""Amie"", is a sad and angry song about a girl whose father sexually molested her. One of the untitled tracks is a phone message from an angry mother who threatens the band after learning about her daughter having gone to one of their shows. Much of the rest is guitar-laden heavy industrial, angry at the world, blah-blah-blah. You've heard this all before from Trent Reznor or somebody like him, I'm sure..."
3,worth it just for 3 or 4 tracks,"While not an essential part of the RCA library of Rich releases, especially at this price (!) the tracks on this date that stand out are Straight, No Chaser, Chelsea Bridge, and Piece of The Road Suite. Production quality is so-so; I always found most of the RCA material to be long on compression, and this is no exception. Buy any Pacific Jazz release first, before you add this to your collection. Other RCA releases that were (are) better quality include Rich In London and Buddy Rich Plays and Plays and Plays."
4,Can't Lose With Elmo :-),"Although I did see some Negative reviews before purchasing this for my 3yr old grandson, I knew he loved Elmo so I took a chance. Probably that or 4yrs old is about the age limit for this game but he thoroughly enjoyed it.Elmo's Number Journey"
2,Amusing,"A game for preschoolers, educational and fun music , controls are pretty easy to learn and sesame characters are always a hit with the kids."
4,just pure hardcore...GOOD STUFF!,That's right! It sounds so much like Training For Utopia and ZAO mixed together! Deffinately worth a listen to! I will warn you now...it is EXTREMELY INTENSE HARDCORE! The only reason it's not 5 stars is because their sound is almost too similar to T.F.U. and ZAO but it is still a VERY good album!
5,Spitfire kicks a$$,"Yo, these are my boys, I've been going to their shows since they were competing in battle of the bands in high school... Buy this record, you will not be disappointed. In fact if you can get their cd ""straining towards what's to come."" get that too...If by some strange act of god you get your hands on their O.G. demo tape, you'd be SUPER STOKED....These guys are chaotic-balls-to-the-wall-hardcore....."
1,Worst album on SolidState Records!,"This album is horrible. I couldn't listen to more than 1 minute of it without changing tracks(and i only got to track 4). I wouldn't recommend buying this album, not even if it were 1 dollar. Horrible."
5,Awesome All-In-One,"I had a Nuvi before this and loved it - Garmin makes the best GPS's - but didn't like having a seperate device for my XM Radio (Samsung Nexus). I tried the 2820 and absolutely love it - in addition to the awesome screen, and complete GPS feature-set (more than the Nuvi), the XM radio is great. The Artist Scan feature is better than on any other radio!"
5,"The best, simply the best! GPS Garmin 2820 rocks!","Garmin StreetPilot 2820 GPS Navigation System with Bluetooth was a life saver. We used it on vacation and were able to enjoy ourselves by saving time in not getting lost, finding the nearest PIzza, walmart, CVS, gas station at the push of a button. Looked up entertainment and found things we didn't know we were near, like a water Park and a zoo, an arcade center, on and on....... It took the frustration out of the vacation and guided us to the most enjoyable family vacation we were ever on! I was able to save all my favorites quickly. It was addicting. Everyone wanted to be the passenger so they could find there fun spots and put them in favorites. I have had other GPS systems, however this one has been the best. My husband hooked up his blackberry to it, and that was fantastic!this is a great product for yourself or for a gift."
3,cradel,The 2820 is not a good application for motorcylces. The screen is not bright enoungh. The 2820 is best for cars. The Zumo 550 is great for bikes
4,Are we there yet?,"Nice GPS and Great price - - - A huge leap forward from my previous unit (Street Pilot 111). Maps and directions update quickly with plenty of options. It comes ready to use -fully loaded. The Bluetooth connection (phone) works well, but I've had complaints of sounding distant. May need to try a different mic??? Can not comment on Sat radio as I did not add antenna."
2,"bad manual, poor design, terrible service","I purchased this device along with a GXM 30 XM radio antenna. When the antenna didn't work(it connects via USB), I thought the problem may be the USB drivers on the main unit. There were no instructions for installing the USB drivers on the disk, and no setup program. I called tech support (which had a 20+ minute wait) and the only help I got was the tech stating that it had worked fine for him and that he didn't think that the lack of instructions, or the lack of a driver installation program, was problematic. I returned the device and I'm still waiting for my refund."
5,"Love It, Love It, Love It","This was a Christmas present for my daughter, who is directionally challenged and living in a city where few of the streets run true north and south (not that she understands north and south anyway.) It's fabulous, and does everything she needs it to do and more.If she wants to find a McDonalds, it'll ask her if she wants one close to her destination or close to her current location.This was pricey, but one of my best purchases ever."
4,Don't leave home without it!!,"I've had this unit for about 6 mo. and I'm extreemly pleased, well worth the $550 I paid on Amazon. I've taken local and long distance trips, in car, van and motorhome. Very easy to use right out of the box, easy to see in the motorhome at distances greater then in a car, even with my sixty year old eyes. We live about 30 miles from Fort Worth and occasionally go into the city, we have used it to find banks, stores and places to eat. On a recent trip to Phoenix, AZ the guidance was especially helpful, I really appreciated the early warning to navigate the freeway interchanges, when to get in the left lane for left exit or how far to next change. On the trip it was helpful to find places to eat. On business trip to Houston I find the ETA info helpful to plan meetings. The remote is helpful in the motorhome, but I knocked off one star becouse of funky power cord connection, and no FM modulator."
5,"Incredibly Powerful, One of the best anthologies","I love poetry and this is one of the best anthologies I have ever read. The poems are moving, sensual beyond description, earthy, humorous, sexy, and very intense. It seems that women writing about other women convey a depth and beauty that I have not often found in heterosexual poetry. Highly recommended for anyone who loves great poetry."
1,Musical excrement.,"Transparent, false, mindless trash. My friend bought this CD(for reasons beyond my comprehension), and we wound up throwing it in my cat's litterbox two days later. The arrangements are, without exception, bland and forgettable. The band members and I were raised in the same community, and the notion that these individuals are expressing ""blue collar lyrical concerns"" is not only utterly laughable, it also completely destroys the credibility of any of the TKO records reviews ever published. The truth is that the band members are all from the ultra-affluent, ultra-white community of Hillsborough, Ca., and their parents' average income is easily in the multi-millions. If you can honestly tell yourself that this album is worth listening to, you are not only musically inept, you have also been fooled by a bunch of rich phonies. This band won't be ""forgotten"" soon enough."
3,"Lots of recipe, small serving size","So there are LOTS of recipes that sound like delicious cookies, but they drop the dough by TEASPOONS. That is one SMALL COOKIE. I think they're trimmed of some of the fat, but most of the calorie savings is in the fact that the cookie serving size is TINY."
3,Careful!,"I purchased this book because unfortunatley I failed to read the fine print...I thought this was exclusively a cookie book and it wasn't. There are recipes for muffins, cakes, etc. Just by looking at the cover you would think that it's only a cookie cookbook."
5,Comprehensive History of Civil War Blockade Running,Stephen Wise has managed to both write a comprehensive history packed with information which is also very readable. Truly a remarkable feat. The book succeeds at both imparting the general course of the blockade running and the many fascinating incidents which make up the history of blockade running.
3,Israel Social Structure,"While I found this to be an interesting insight to Israel and some of the morays of Jewish life paradigms of which I was not aware, it is so specific in its scope that it excluded any empathy developing. The religious fanaticism that was he foundation on which this perplexing father/son relationship was hung, made the nuances so specific to the Jewish culture that it excludes a lot of non Jews. The same movie could have been made about Muslims with little change in the screen play. I am sure that this movie is very moving to people who live in similar situations but for the rest ""Death of a Salesman's"" father figure may resonate more. Good acting, good subject but disappointing theme choice."
4,Footnote,Powerful movie exploring the complexities of father-son relationships. Tour de force dialogue. A glimpse into the powerful Jewish intelect. Unfulfilling ending.
2,Starts out well but in the end dissappoints,"The idea for this movie is just great - and during the initial discovery and handling of the mistake, the film really holds you. But then in the last quarter of the movie, the characters tend to darken creating a depressing ending that seems out of character for the elderly father. In other words you are left wondering why he did not do the ""right thing""."
2,Tedious,If you like listening to dialog in Hebrew in a story about not much then you will like this movie.
5,Good and to the point allegory,"Anyone in the academic world will defiantly enjoy this one.Really had fun watching it, it is a good and to the point allegory"
4,The best Cult album ever! Ian Astbury in his prime.,"The Cult's SONIC TEMPLE just blew me away the first time I heard it. There is not one bad song on the whole album. Why these guys broke up, I'll never know."
4,Catchiest Cult Album,"I just recently purchased this cd along with Love and Electric. I have to say this is the catchiest of the 3. Astbury's voice is borderling ridiculous (over the top), but I don't see that as a bad thing at all. Songs like Fire Woman and American Horse have been stuck in my head ever since I heard them. Some people like put down this album for being ""commercialized"" in order to sound sophisticated, but I don't really agree with that. Sometimes music has to be taken at face value; The Cult didn't write deep lyrics for the most part. Duffy's guitar riffs are something to be admired, made me pick up my guitar and learn them. Overall I think this CD is a must for any rock fan period."
5,Way better than all the 80's music combined,Why these guys didn't just surpass all the rest is a mystery to me. This is more real Rock than most of the 80's music. Don't get me wrong I love the 80's hair era for the fun and all but it was all disposable. The Cult transcend the trends and could back it all up with some powerful riffs. This wasn't their best but it still kicks.
5,Forget hair metal 80's - This is where it's at. . .,"They were alway's ahead of the pack in one way or another, this is just another example. Glam and hair were in and the Cult came out and just jammed. They took metal to a new high with a different direction. Sure they had a big Zep thing going on but they didn't just rip them off like Kingdome Come or Whitesnake. They took what was great and brought it into the 90's. They complimented the founders. This CD is just a beginning to end Jam. The Cult Rule!!!!!!!!!"
5,"Bought this album in 89,still love it!!!!","I bought this album about 10 years ago,and i still enjoy listening to as much as when i first got it!Probably my favourite album of all time even though i love things a bit heavier!"
5,transcendental,"this is one of the greatest rock albums ever recorded. there is no filler- every one of these songs deserved airplay on every FM station at the time.my particular favorite is ""soul asylum""- listen to this and hear them channeling led zeppelin.perhaps the most underappreciated hard rock group of all time, and the most underappreciated metal album of all time."
5,Classic British Hard Rock,"Hard rock at its fullest. While in the band's earlier years, they had sounded more post-punk, on 1989's Sonic Temple (as the title and cover suggest), the band turns into a full-fledged heavy metal band. The songs are well written and well played. Ian Astbury is a singer that can very well entertain you. The guitars are energetic, and have a sound that can make you want to bang your head. Some of the Cult's finest material is on here like Sun King, Fire Woman, and Edie. Some less heard of songs on here that are just as good are American Horse and New York City. Go buy this."
3,electric love,"I have a few cd's of the cult although thats not what i am really after if anyone knows where i could possibly get the video, I think its called electric love??would be much appreciatedtracey"
5,"The Cult ""Sonic Temple""","Here it is the year 2000 & I have just found one of my all time favorite albums by surfing the web! When I first heard The Cult was back in 1993 that is when I purchased their tape. I loved it & my tape has mysteriously disapeared (borrowed perhaps by one of my 4 pre-teen to adult children), undaunted I am now going to the CD version. This is definately a must have for my music collection! I love every second of it and it will never grow old. I am 42 years old and in my opinion I believe it to be a mixture of Steppenwolf & Aerosmith combined. A true classic. It flows smooth through all the tracks taking you on a musical ride wanting more!"
1,Face It People--The Cult Sold Us Out,"This album represents Ian Astbury's utter abandonment of his artistic integrity. We're faced with the spectacle of the band that was Southern Death Cult and Death Cult pandering to metal lunkheads for dollars. Memo to Ian and Billy: give it up, RATT and W.A.S.P will blow you away on their turf."
1,Face It People--The Cult Sold Us Out,This album represents Ian Astbury's utter abandonment of his artistic integrity. We're faced with the spectacle of the band that was Southern Death Cult and Death Cult pandering to metal lunkheads for dollars. Memo turf.
2,Macintosh Compatible - Sort of,"I'm sure this a fine DVD Writer for PC users, but the Plextor claim of compatibility with Macintosh is really very limited. You will need to run OS X.4 or higher if you want use the Macintosh Finder to burn discs. Even then, it doesn't work very well and fails on burns frequently. Plextor will tell you to spend $100 on Toast software. Well guess what, the price of this drive just doubled. I was also told both by Plextor and by Dantz who makes Retrospect software prior to buying it that this drive should work with Retrospect. It doesn't. Dantz has since said they are working on a fix, but when that will happen is uncertain. I called Plextor and their technician's solution was spend $100 on Toast and say it's my computers fault. My advice for Mac users is to stick with companies such as LaCie and Iomega that offer drivers and don't blame the Macintosh OS if there's a problem."
3,Twice as expensive for MAC users,"works fine on macs, just that u have to spend $100 for the software and additional $20 for a firewire cable."
3,Nearly a great band,"Why is it so difficult to get hold of a true greatest hits for this underrated band. Not well known in UK, I have the original Time Has Come and New Time/New Day LPs - many of better tracks not available on any current CD.This probably the best of the available catalogue but missing Midnight Hour - surely one of the best versions ever made."
5,A good and interesting chess video game for PS1 & PS2,"The color and type (2-D or 3-D) of the chess pieces, boards and backgrounds can be changed the way you feel comfortable for playing the game. I especially like the 2-D visual set up because with the non-clolor (black) background, I can comfortably stare at the TV screen and think about the next moves. The 2-D borad shows the plan view of the chess pieces that will not block the view of the squares in fornt of the other pieces. The chess pieces and board are shown clearly on the TV screen. You can choose to play with the CPU opponents with rating from 100 to 2700 or so. No waiting for your partner, friend or coach is required. Quick hints are handy dandy furnished if needed. Besides the other Windows PC chess games, this PS1 game is one of my favorite games. Also it is cheap and can be played by PS2 too."
5,Heard about it on SomaFM,"I heard the track 'Easy, Like' while listening to SomaFM.com and found a piece worth listening to over and over. This CD was the soundtrack to my summer evenings...'Serve Chilled' is all chill... goes nicely with ""A Taste of Pork"" as well."
3,A mixed bag,In about half of the songs included in this CD Ms Simone gets to display extraordinary talent and creativity. Sadly in the other half the song chosen or musical accompanimnet does not allow her to realize her full potential.
5,Good stuff,"This series gets better by the book (so far anyway). I have to say this is a well written series, even if it is geared for a ""younger"" audience. Still not totally sold on having Boba in here, but I don't feel as bad about it. I still almost wish they had used a different bounty hunter, or use an Inquisitor. Maybe he'll grow on me as the series progresses. Don't get me wrong, this is only a minor gripe, but it's the only strike I personally have against the series. Ferus is a good main character, and Trever is as well. The overall storyline is well conceived and well presented. Hopefully we'll see more of Obi-Wan and almost as much of Qui-Gon. It has me hooked to find out more."
5,Amazing Book,I bought this book off the base of all the 5 star reviews and I am amazed and this is the second book and Don`t get me started on the first book. This series so far has been amazing. This series is a must have for any star wars fan as well as any avid reader who likes action and mystery.
1,This is a terrible CD. Awful !,"The songs are very bad, stupid, no real melodies, stupid lyrics but what is more important it is very irritating because of the awful background: He has what seems to be 2-3 men singing in support (underlining the lyrics, responding to it) and it is awful. The other review says ""most of them have call-and-response vocals between Louis and band"". Yeah, and that is exactly what destroys the listening experience.I don't understand why he recorded such garbage.Awful !! You don't believe me ? Spend $3 and judge for yourself. But you have been warned."
1,"What were you thinking, Louis?!?!","Louis Prima's best period was the mid-thirties as all true hepcats know. During this time he recorded his original vocal version of the Benny Goodman classic, ""Sing, Sing, Sing"". He spent the rest of his career sounding like a dorky, juvenile version of the great Louis Jordan. With few exceptions, most of his later recordings annoy the hell out of me. If you watch Sesame Street and play with Fischer Price toys, you might like this CD. If you can find it real cheap, buy it and use it as a drink coaster....Cheers!"
4,Get the French version!,"I'm not familiar with Kate Ryan, but when I first listened to this song, I was pretty impressed by it. IMHO, the French version is better than the English version (""Scream For More""), even though I don't know French. Kate has such a unique voice, so it's very hard to compare her to other singers out there. In a way, she's in a category of her own. This type of music is not similiar to Ian van Dahl, Milk Inc, Sylver, etc. and it's not totally popish either. Preview the song first before you buy."
1,Boring and limited compared to others on the market.,"Unless you are about 5 years of age and have no concept of quality/fun/gaming, I'd not recommend this game. It gets boring after about 5 minutes. Even the intro was terrible. The story line was stupid, and all in all, I'd give this game a big zero. The graphics are decent, but the boredom and useless factor weigh against anything relevant. If you would like to check it out anyway, I'd recommend you rent it first. Who knows, a few people may enjoy it."
2,The makers of SoulFighter need professional therapy,"The makers of Soul Fighter really crossed the line as far as i'm concerned. This is by far one of the worst games i've ever played in my life. Graphics and music don't mean everything (And neither one of those were thoroughly impressive). First and formost, if i wanted to get a dizzy spell, i could just as easily run outside and spun in circles and saved myself about 50 dollars. Then you have to listen to the same old music over and over and over (get the point?). And lets not even get into the fun factor of this game. This is one of the first games i've ever played where i took it back only hours afterward. Some might say that i should have given it more time. Trust me. It didn't deserve the small amount of time i gave it. Terrible, terrible, terrible."
1,not worth your time,"this game is not worth your time i promise u i opened and 3 min i wanted to take it back even if i lose money on it, this game is the worst game for dreamcast yet and im not even kidding u"
4,A Soul Fighter Review,"This is not to great a game, at list that's what I think. The 3d fx aren't to bad but its not the best iv seen. This game has a lame background story that has bean used in several games in the past years. But a perfectly good game in any other way . ; )So if you're looking for entertainment this is probably your game."
5,Sarah the Magnificent,"Sarah Vaughan is undoubtedly one of the greatest singers ever. The richness of her vocals, her phrasing, the emotion that shimmers not saturates - nothing short of divine.This was my first recording by Miss Vaughan and the reason I chose it over all the others was the inclusion of ""Dreamsville"" which is one of my all time favorite songs. This version is now my all time favorite rendition.The sound quality is excellent and there are lots of goodies to choose from - a whopping 16 songs - but other highlights include: ""Someone to Watch Over Me"" and ""Body and Soul"" and ""I've Got a Crush on You"" and..... oh, they're all wonderful.I, too, am a bit baffled by the choice of cover. Why not a picture of the lovely Sarah? hmmm....odd, just odd.Anyway, I highly recommend this CD to Sarah Vaughan fans, those who love classic songs magnificently sung, and anyone who wants to kick back and escape to Dreamsville."
3,Good product with one limitation,"Good product with one limitation, that being that the ""legs"" are not deep enough to clear the soffit and gutter"
2,Not Worth The Money,"Can get the very same product at Ocean State Job Lot for $8.00!!! I paid $29.00 on Amazon. Wish I had known. Very cheap piece of tin. Haven't used it yet. If you want one of these, try your job lot type stores."
5,it is the best mix of punk and hardcore i have ever heard,this is a great cd if you are a fan of punk or hardcore i say get this or be shot
2,christian label but where are the christian lyrics?????,great sound.i love the sound.east coast hardcore is great but i thought solid state was a christian label??????i hate when bands do that.
3,Informative,"Midkiff does a good job of presenting this crisis in an easy-to-understand manner. I learned a lot about the water crisis by reading this book. The writing is a little dry, with no maps, photos or graphs to help the reader to better understand the situation. In addition, Midkoff's personal bias towards conservation over innovation (seawater desalinization, iceberg towing) comes across loud and clear. Usually, as a Neo-Green, I get turned off by this sort of ""doing less is the only way to save the planet"" type of preaching. However, in the case of water, Conservation may just be the best tool for the job. I would definitely recommend this book for anyone who feels in the dark about the water crisis."
5,Great brush! Great price!,"I first got this brush from a stylist back in the mid 90s. I loved it and have bought it a couple times. It's great for using with a hair dryer. It's gentle on the hair. I have fine hair but lots of it. It's slightly wavy, so I can style it with a blow dryer and this round brush with plastic bristles is perfect. It combs easily through wet hair and doesn't pull. I've found they last about 5 years."
5,Best brush ever!,"I got one of these years ago at a salon, and wore it out. I checked Amazon last Christmas to see if I could find one like it, and voila! I bought one for myself and several more to give out as teenager Christmas gifts. It's a wonderful brush, and I will buy a couple more! The best thing about it is that it doesn't hurt your scalp (it is very flexible) and it's great at getting through tangles."
1,too difficult to build,this toy was very fun to play with (loved the spiral and gears concept) but the hours it took to build made it not worth it. It is so flimsy I have no doubt that if I wanted to waste 3 more hours I could do it again daily. I just don't have time to constantly play Mrs. Fix-it!I wouldn't recommend this to other parents unless you have 11 or 12 year olds who could independantly build and fix it themselves.
1,Frustration,Frustrating...my husband and I worked for hours to get this set up much to the disappointment of our five year old son.Pieces did not stay locked in placedirections were vague and difficult and skip stepsmaterials were flimsy and did not fit together wellWhile I was excited about the prospect of fun this toy could bring it came far from delivering.We returned this product
3,Don't count on having the pieces!,"This toy was all that my son asked for for Christmas. Luckily he got other things! I spent 6 hours putting this together on December 26 and found that I was missing a piece. I called customer service and she interrupted with ""What piece are you missing?"" so obviously, this is a common occurrence! She did say that she would send the piece 'right' out. We received the piece today, JANUARY 8! 12 days later. So, finally, my son gets to play with his Christmas gift. He does love it and it is a lot of fun although the ages 8+ on the box is deceiving as there is no way he could have put this together by himself!"
1,Poor quality-broke before we got it assembled.,"I do not recommend this toy. Parts broke before we got the thing assembled-which by the way with children ""helping"" took two hours. Once assembled the kids had a great time until it started falling apart. Not a toy to put up and then store easily; more than likely you will put it up once and then never bring it out again.I plan on returning it and trying again with another product."
2,Very Disappointing,"When I saw this ""award winning"" toy on sale, I decided to buy it for my son who absolutely loves marble tracks and gears, and all things technical. My son was very excited by it but I am disappointed. I thought it would be more flexible in allowing your own creations but it has so many specialized pieces and different connectors that it is quite hard to create your own.It is very time consuming to build the pictured set-up. The instructions for it (i.e. just the one creation) are 45 pages long! It is easy to go wrong due to some of the different building blocks looking so similar. Perhaps they should have been color coded. Once put together it falls apart easily. Admittedly my son is not the recommended 8 years.The plastic pieces are of poor quality and do not fit together nicely like Lego does. Several of the little white pieces that attach the cog wheels snapped on Day 1. Later the spiral piece (marble lift) snapped which pretty much renders the toy useless."
1,Don't buy this,This took me hours to put together and continuously fell apart every time my son tried to use. It was very frustrating.
1,An Exercise in Frustration,"This toy cannot be constructed intuitively. One must painstakingly follow the directions to get a working marble run. It took me hours to assemble and I'm good at these sorts of things. The green vertical pieces are easy to mix up which means you have to take it all apart if you get one piece in the wrong place because it is 1/4"" shorter than another. Do not attempt to put together with any ""help"" from your child (and what is the point, then?). Although the description says ages 6 and up, I'm pretty sure the box has it labeled as 8 and up. We returned it and found better uses for our money."
3,Missing a Part,"It took two adults to put this thing together for our grandson. About 3/4 of the way through, we discover it is missing a part. It had two of another part. Contacted the company and they said they would mail the missing part. Grandson does enjoy playing with it."
4,Fun way to Spend a few hours,"Pros:1. fun to construct, especially if you can keep your child interested2. if you or your child like rub-goldberg devices, you will enjoy watching the operation of this one.3. I believe there may be some flexibilty to re-build the system in your own custom wayCons:1. Not sure how much ""replay value"" it will have2. Obviously construction is lego quality plastic, except with moving parts, so it will break easily3. custom rebuild ability may not be to the level of a lego set, unless you had at least one additional setOverall this one was a winner. Initially, when I first opened the box, it was overwhelming, as there are literally hundreds of parts, all requiring assembly. The instructions are great, but it still takes minimum 3 hours to construct. I started it one evening, then got my 5 yr old daughter to help me pick out the pieces and finished the next day. That was some good quality time, which is what I was after all along."
1,Not worth the money.,Very limited in creativity and a monster to put together. Child used it for 10 minutes and it now is gathering dust. Cannot be reconstructed in various configurations as implied by the ad so there is no way to use it other than one simple marble track. One of the worst toys we have purchased.
4,Good fun!,"I put this together with my 7year old son in a couple of hours. He couldn't have done it himself but it was afun project for us to do together. It's only been up for a couple days but he is really enjoying playing with it. The gears don't always work properly and sometimes the marbles need to be nudged, but I think that is good for him because it makes him feel like an engineer who needs to fix his machine. I'd recommend it!"
1,Frustrated and defeated,"This is my very first negative review of a toy in ten years of being a parent. This toy took atleast 6 hours to assemble (could not be completed in one sitting), and when we finally finished it, it did not work! The gears were too tight or sticky to allow the ball to roll! I have never been so frustrated in my life! I'm tempted to bring it out on the roof and drop it so it can smash into millions of pieces. Please do not waste your time and money on this piece of junk!"
4,Excellent exercises for beginning french,"To use this this book you need to have access to the French in Action videos, and to the French in Action audio cassettes. Note that this entry is for the older edition ... you should consider getting the second edition instead. And you have to careful that your workbook is of the same edition as your audio cassettes. It would help if Amazon would clearly label each of these. That said, in any edition this is an excellent way to learn french, either as part of a course or by yourself."
4,The Night They Raided Minsky's,"Needed a copy of this on ANY condition to show a friend. This inexpensive, thoroughly used paperback i got from an Amazon listing filled the bill. Just what i wanted."
2,Disappointed!,"With the other good reviews, I had high expectations. I thought this whole movie was weak. They replay multiple of the same fights over and over just with a different soundtrack. If you've never seen a real fight in your life then this may appeal to you. These are mainly scuffles more than brawls. Everyone is so tangled together all the time no one can even throw a punch. There may be one or two ""decent fights"" and that's it. Even those fights are usually one sided. One guy chasing another around the parking lot. If you must buy this movie, DO NOT SPEND 40 DOLLARS ON THIS! ITS OUTRAGEOUS THAT THEY COULD CHARGE THIS! I WOULDN'T PAY MORE THAN 5 DOLLARS!"
4,FOCUS DAMN IT!,Frat boys beating the crap out of one another. I like watching idiots fight. I wish it was more in focus and they would look the the view finder when they were shooting it but hey who cares bring on the blood.
4,Good buy,"Yeah, even some pretty good and real girlfights. Not quite as good as Fighting Mad, but definitely a good buy, I'd say."
1,"Treasures and Scavanger Hunt: How to plan, create, & give..",I was completely disappointed in the book. I was so excited to get it in the mail. After I got it in the mail and read it I felt like I wasted my money!!! I really thought the book would focus mainly on the different types of treasure and scavanger hunts and give several examples and already planned hunts but there is very little. There was pointless information given throughout the entire book.
4,"Clear, clever directions for a great hunt!","The author offers plenty of clever ways to conduct a scavenger/treasure hunt. My only caveat is that the hunts all seemed based on driving or walking through a town, with no suggestions for scaling it back to a yard or house, because he feels that numbers (house numbers, price of an item, speed limit sign) should serve as the items that are sought. Lots of warnings about not letting drunk guests drive, etc. Still one of the best books I've found on the subject."
5,just as described,"the other reviews say it all, a lot of information, not rocket science but practical, helpful & helps avoid common mistakes for a better overall experience."
1,Waste of money,"This book does not provide what the title suggests it would. This book did not provide useful, realistic ways to do scavenger hunts."
3,"Not bad, but there are better resources","This book is not bad, but it is a little disappointing. Both Galbraith'sThe Great Crash 1929and Frederick Lewis Allen'sOnly Yesterday: An Informal History of the 1920'swere written within a couple of years of the Crash, and are arguably (1) better written and (2) more tightly constructed. For sheer detail of the financial world, either Galbraith's book or the original Pecora Report from Ferdinand Pecora and the congressional committee that investigated the causes of the crash (The Pecora Report: The 1934 Report on the Practices of Stock Exchanges from the ""Pecora Commission"") would be better matches and more interesting reads."
3,"Good, but not good enough","Klein's retelling of the story of the stock market crash of 1929 is just too little and much too late. Other books, notably Only Yesterday by F.L. Allen for anecdotal material and The Great Crash of 1929 by J. K. Galbraith for analysis, go over the same material and do a better job. Klein's book does have some strong points: wonderful vignettes of some of the people, big and small, who were caught up in the crash; a good analysis of why Herbert Hoover, ""the great engineer,"" couldn't engineer his way out of this one; some interesting anecdotal material I haven't seen anywher else. But all of that could have been done in less than half the space. Nice try, but no cigar."
4,A time of irrational exuberance,"I liked this book in spite of its dry writing style. It covers an important event in U.S. history, namely the great crash of the stock market in 1929. Most of the book is about the events leading up to the crash. Some of the tidbits that the author brings to light are very interesting and others are more ordinary. My feeling is that this book is an excellent starting place for understanding the 1920s and the crash. However, other reading will be necessary to get a broader overview of the times. This story is mostly from the viewpoint of persons in Washington D.C. and New York."
2,Looking for Detail and Coming Up Short,"This book is very similar to what is known as a 'review of the literature' found in academic journals. The Crash was first and foremost a financial event but Klein does not really address finance other than to survey what people thought. I get no feel for what may have caused the Crash nor do I walk away feeling educated about the period. It has all been done better before, namely Galbraith and F.L. Allen in their own way. Historians need to know more finance before tackling this topic which is why Klein does not succeed."
5,Buddy showing who's the king of drums,"I was very excited upon finding this cd. Not only does it contain classic tunes like ""Time Being"", ""Two Bass Hit"", ""Dancing Men"" and ""Little Train""; all the cuts and the sound are of superior quality to anything I have ever heard before. Buddy and his sidemen are at their very best; trumpeter Lin Biviano and tromboneman Bruce Paulson handle their instruments with so much energy and excitement that you are sure to hear some top-notch big band jazz. In addition to the leader's impeccable drumming and god-like solos, it's more than an average Buddy cd, because you can hear that he and his band are so inspired and play with vitality. This cd goes far beyond anything in selections, sound and drive. It's well worth the price and more."
4,Calming Music at Its Best,"The music on this CD is the perfect tonic after a long day. Every song on this CD is perfect, flawless. It makes for great background music for a dinner party or simply music to unwind by, my preference. I would highly recommend Mr. Peterson virtuoso playing to everyone. Elaine"
4,Great low budget brush,"This is a good, sturdy, inexpensive brush for all hair types. I am pleased to have purchased it and hope it lasts a very long time."
2,Honestly...,I didn't really like it... :/ It didn't meet my expectations. It just felt too rough on my scalp and hair. Ended up giving it away.
2,Boring!,"On the cover there's a blurb from the NY Times: ""Lore Segal may have come closer than anyone to writing the Great American Novel."" Also, called ""charming and comical"".Huh-did I read the same book? It was not funny, not unforgettable, and just plain boring. Am I just jaded? Maybe I've read too many books in the 63 years I've been reading. There are some real stinkers that get really good reviews. Makes me wonder."
5,awesome stoner music,"For everyone who wakes and bakes and stays that way 24/7 this is an awesome, must-have CD."
3,inferior verdict,"Having watched this movie years ago in the French version,with English subtitles,I thought it was an excellent if somewhat slow story about a woman visiting the judge who is heading the trial of her son on a charge of murder.Both Loren and Gabin are very good in this movie.Loren looks great in her designer wardrobe.The son is basically an unsimpathetic character,whose flaws have perhaps been caused,indirectly,by his overprotective and possessive mother.The mother pleads for her sons life.The judge is convinced of his guilt....Excellent film flawed by terrible dubbing,it isn't even Loren's voice,and the poor quality of the print used.Inferior treatment of a very good film."
5,Great for small children,"I bought this for my 1 year old nephew last year for his birthday and he loved it! It was smaller than I expected, but it was a perfect size for him... and it has dinosaurs on it!"
3,Chamelion Heart Throb,This little made-for-TV movie is based upon a true crime story. It held my interest enough for me to do a little research to learn the progress of post movie criminal case against the protagonist.
4,Petards - 'Anthology' (Bear Family) 6-CD box set,"I give it 4 1/2 stars. First off, I'd like to mention that I don't own a copy of this 6-CD box set. I merely borrowed a copy from a fellow patron. Thus so,I had time to listen to each CD just once,and I liked what I heard. If you'd like to maybe check out a short version of this 6-CD (whew! takes time to listen to this entire box set), you might want to see if you can locate a copy of their self-titled 1-disc 'Anthology', ALSO on the Bear Family label (see my review). Total of 118 songs. Most of their tunes are well written and well played 'psychedelic pop', like ""Baby, Run Run Run"", ""She Didn't"", ""Fire Tree"", ""Roses For Kathy"", ""Girl,Where You Going Now"", ""Shoot Me Up To The Moon"" and simply too many more to list here. Also liked their covers of John Fogerty's ""Proud Mary"" and the Stone's gem ""Ruby Tuesday"". If you got the ca$h and you enjoy this genre, you might want to obtain a copy of this import release. A definite should-have."
1,urgh..,"Yuck, this is the kind of thing that makes playstation owners say the N64 is a kids console, then again they have this also, and they have barbie.. heheh."
1,A huge waste of money,"I bought this game for my three year old son who was just beginning to take an interest in his older brother's SNES and I wanted a game that would be ""appropriate"" for his age. He has played this game about 4 times and is bored with it already! All you do in this game is lead Elmo through various ""worlds"" as he collects a certain letter of the alphabet. There is no challenge to the controls whatsoever because Elmo really only moves in one direction on the screen - forward. This game is too simple even for the youngest toddler. I think I'll let my son stick to Spyro the Dragon for now!"
1,"Sesame Street Characters are cute, but what a waste of $$$","I'd rate this game at zero stars, but they won't let me. I bought this game for my nephew (age 5). With little help from me, he completed all 3 levels and the bonus stage in about 1 hour. Now he won't touch it. For the money being charged for this game, I expected a lot more than 1 hour of play before he tired of it. Using video games to help children learn is a great idea, but there was a whole lot more they could have done with this game and didn't."
1,No Star Rating Here,"Do not, I repeat, do not waste your money. This game is the epitome of boring. My kids (4 and 5) do not like it all. They have several nintendo games and they simply refuse to play this game. I feel that it is my responsibility to spare you the disappointment that you will experience should you buy this game. It is slow, annoying, and it aggravates me. I am going to destroy it right now. SMASH SMASH SMASH"
5,Billie at the Top of Her Game,"A highly-recommended CD. If you prefer Billie Holiday backed by a quartet or piano as opposed to a full-scale orchestra, then this is for you. What makes this a treat is Billie's singing, which is o-so sublime. Her voice is clear, full, and flushed with melancholic phrasing, with none of the harsh tone or roughness that was to creep up in time. Put this CD in your player and be prepared to be transported to a dimly-lit cabaret room in the early '40s, serenaded by Billie's warm, sensual vocals. Some of the songs are cornerstones of the American pop catalog (i.e. I'll be Seeing You, Embraceable You...) that have been covered by other artists such as Sinatra, but Billie makes these songs entirely her own."
5,recommend for chic flick kind of a tear jerker,Great movie. Very touching. Chick flick don't try to get the boyfriend to watch it..ladies will love it especially if they have ever dealt with infertility or trouble adopting
4,Great piano course,I teach the premier piano course and I have been very happy with the piano course books! These are great for kids ages 7+ and the songs are interesting to play.
4,How To Behave Like a Princess,This Book is a very entering book for childern. I think that it gives them an idea of how to behave at home and at school. This book makes young and imaginative girls act more like princess. I will give this book 4 stars because I think that boys would not be as found of a princess book. But that only took off one star the other 4 are for the girls in which have dreamed to be princess their entire lives!
4,The Surprising Purpose of Anger: Beyond Anger Management: Finding the Gift (Nonviolent Communication Guides),"Very insightful and helpful information for dealing with the root of anger. The book is an easy read, it will cause you to stop and consider where the anger is coming from and how you can think differently about your feelings."
5,Great variety!,This cd box set (originally a three disk set) is probably one of the best compilations his music I have heard as yet. Duke Ellington's approach to the blues and swinging fusion Jazz makes for great jams as well as some awsome vocals by the likes of Sarah Vaughn and Billy Epsen. One of my favorites by far is the upbeat version of the C-jam blues on this album. Well done Sir Duke!
1,Presumptuous,"Kent larson presumes he can show a finished Kahn using a computer. As we all know, the building process is evolving. It certainly was for Kahn. Larson's leaden computer graphics shed not even the glimmer of a candle on the genius of Kahn."
3,Gets better the further in you go,"I read a Leather book a couple years ago and wasn't hooked. I thought I'd give him another go recently and started to get into it. Having just finished a couple Sheppard books and really enjoying them I thought I'd give this one a try. It didn't hook me like the Spider Sheppard books but as I stuck with it the story started to draw me in. As others have said, you'll have a pretty good idea who the 'killer' is before it is announced and it is announced by the middle of the story - if its mystery you're after this my not be for you. But if you're after an interesting and engaging muder/action tale then you'll probably enjoy it. I almost gave it four stars but gave it three because it took a little while to get into it."
4,A book with a difference,"Although many storylines went nowhere, the books main story tended to keep you intrigued. The concept of short chapters tends to make you want to keep reading.I was impressed by the overall story and the concept of the tunnels made it fairly exciting, expecially with the connections. The end seems to suggest another book, but we will have to wait and see."
3,buyer should note,"It is a nice unit well made but buyer should be aware that it draws 35 amps and even the best cigarett lighters only provide 20 amps, Had to run a new line and lighted socket into car. Or you can just plan on hooking directly to battery with provided clips."
4,Read the product abilities before buying,"I bought this power inverter for tailgating. It was not able to power any of the appliances that we plugged into it. Upon further inspection, the appliances we were using used too much power for this Inverter.READ THE RATINGS on all inverters you are looking at buying, as well as the power usage of appliances you are trying to power."
4,"Amazon, please carry this again!","With a good diet and workout routine, this seems to work well for me and I can see results when I use it. I am half way through my 2nd bottle and wanted to order more however atm amazon is not carrying it for some reason."
2,Get Mario Kart DS,"If you like kart racing games got for Mario Kart, this game is not at the same level when it comes to graphics, controls, re-playability and overall fun."
2,consistency of uncooked dough,"comes in a box shape, not round. at $9.50 for shipping, I was surprised it came by postal mail and slowly. Doughy, undercooked product."
4,Soap as it should be... simple,"Let's be honest, it's soap. In a bag. In a box.Order arrived in a timely fashion, fit into my wall-mounted unit without hassle and was dispensing properly within minutes.The scent is enjoyable and the cleansing action reliable."
2,This frame's going back,"I bought Mustek for 60, which is a good deal for 7in. But the resolution is rather low, only 480 by 340. Photos are quite pixelated. More disappointing is the contrast. The whole frame looks kind of grayish. I guess the problem is the black is not truly the black.The other problem is the design. The memory card slots are quite deep in the back. It's hard to pull cards out once fully pushed in. And it doesn't recognize the card sometime. I'm returning it."
3,"happy for the price, but tricks to displaying photos","this is a xmas gift for my mom, but unfortunately, i don't think she'll be able to figure out much more than on/off. repeating several points others have made and adding a few of my own: the larger the file the longer the load time, i haven't found a random slideshow, you almost have to use 2 memory cards to separate pix of different orientation (but not a must), and the resolution is a mystery. i'm personally running it at 480x338, but this doesn't match the physical aspect ratio of the screen (so pix look stretched). so here's the solution i just came up with, assuming you're starting with a 4:3 ratio: resize pix to 599x449 with ""photo resizer"", crop to 599x338 with ""jpegcrops"", then resize to 480x338 with ""photo resizer"" (distorts pix, but frame undistorts them). crazy, huh? anywho, now that i've kind of figured it out, i'm pleased with the results. would i recommend it? probably, but too bad i couldn't just stick the card in and turn it on!"
4,Very Good Photo Frame the the money,"Purchased 2 for X-Mas, very simple and easy to use. Doesn't have all the bells and whistles but welove these frames."
1,Poor quality,"I was given this frame as a gift and unfortunately it only lasted 4 months. The quality of the resolution was poor and now it will not work at all. I called the manufacturer but was told I must have received a ""faulty"" one and they only guaranteed it for 90 days.I would not suggest purchasing this item."
4,"Good, cheap, picture frame","It works as advertised. All you need to do is drop in a memory card and it just works! Could be a better picture, but for the price, a good value."
1,Not worth the money-- no matter how inexpensive,"I have buyers remorse-- I should have spent the extra money and bought a real digital photo display product. The aspect ratio is crazy, the pictures fuzzy and distorted. If having to resize and recrop your photos sounds like ""easy to use"" then you've got more time than I do! Net-net, don't buy it."
3,It's a nice present but there're technical drawbacks,"The main disadvantage of Mustek PF-A700B 7-Inch Multimedia Digital Photo Viewer is the format 16:9. It would be ok, but even if I cut my photos to this format, it doesn't show it fullscreen mode. It remains black stripes at the top and the bottom as if it shrinks my foto from 4:3. I believe this could be solved, but I haven't found the solution yet.I'd recommend bying Coby DP772 7-Inch Widescreen Digital Photo Frame with MP3 Player. It's not as expensive as Philips (which are the best Digital Photo Frames) but it's more user-friendly."
2,"would be a great product, but...","I got this frame as a Mother's Day present for my mom. I loaded up an SD card and installed it for her. It's very easy to set up and use. But I was very disappointed to discover that even though it is a wide-screen viewer (modes for aspect ratio of 4:3 and 16:9), the 16:9 mode is COMPLETELY USELESS!! It STRETCHES regular images to make them fit the screen. What kind of idiot thought of that??? I have a bunch of panoramic pics from our family reunion I wanted to be able to display in the full wide-screen mode, but since they're only displayable in 4:3 mode, they shrink down to fit within the smaller dimensions which makes it hard to see the detail.If not for that one major problem, this would have been a great gift for Mom."
2,"image ok, time of upload poor","Expected much more from this product.Images are slow to load - sometimes verrrry slow.If you use a large card with many images, it takes forever to start and to sequence thru the images.Image clarity = OKwould not buy again."
2,Misleading product information,"Product description says the frame comes with a ""credit card sized remote..."", what remote??? No remote here! You have to do all the adjustments, set up and volume control using the itty bitty buttons on the back of the frame which is VERY frustrating for grandparents receiving this as a present. You have to leave the USB stick or memory card in or have it plugged into the computer - you cannot ""upload"" images onto it. It looks really lovely with a USB stick sticking out of the side 24/7. Also, it MUST be plugged in - it does not take batteries which was another bit convienently left out of the product specs. The image quality is only great when you are standing FAR away! We are returning it the same day we got it."
2,Just ok,This frame is just ok you have to resize all your pictures and the quality is not good at all you are just better off paying the extra $75 and getting the phillips
3,Good for the money but horrible customer support,"I've emailed tech support and customer sevice twice each and have not received any replies. I called them but the guy spoke very little English and had no idea what I was asking him. I wanted to know how long it is safe to leave it turned on.Their own website says it is capable of playing video clips (it is not). I tried to mention that to the guy I spoke with but he didn't understand that, either."
2,instruction not clear,"The instruction on loading photos on to digital frame is really not clear, this item was purchased for last Christmas and I still do not have pictures loaded on to frame. I have considered returning item."
3,bastante engorroso si no conoces photoshop...,"el portaretrato tiene 2 modos 4:3 (el original de las fotos) y 16:9 (widescreen). las fotos se ven excelentes en modo 4:3 pero hay un pequeño detalle, y es que deja dos bandas negras a los lados...quise poner las fotos full pantalla, pero me las deformaba. abri photoshop y recorte las fotos, pero no funciono. hasta que se me ocurrio deformar las fotos un 75% en escala horizontal sin afectar la vertical, y asi fue como finalmente funciono. tuve que hacer ese proceso en aproximadamente 400 fotos. nada facilpor lo demas, es bastante sencillo de utilizar, acepta los formatos mas comunes de tarjeta para camara y hasta pen drives. no tiene limitacion de tamaño para la tarjeta (yo le comptre un SD de 4gb y funciona perfecto).de verdad quede un poco decepcionado por lo de la deformacion. no lo recomiendo para la gente que no sabe usar programas de edicion de imagen."
3,Not Bad (for Price)!!!,"PROS: Good looking, good price.CONS: All pictures must be edited for proper viewing (reduce width to 77%, crop as a 5x7, reduce maximum width to 480 pixels), controls somewhat cumbersome."
2,It was good while it lasted,"My husband bought this digital photo frame for me in March 2007 and it was great. The image quality was good, it was simple to use, and I received nice comments on it in my office. Fast forward to June 2008 and the screen started to flicker every so slightly. Fast forward again to August 2008 and the screen started to pixelate and now it is dead. The frame won't even turn on. If you're buying this beware of the short life."
3,so so,"it does the job, just remember, theres no internal memory...youre going to need to get an sd card to go with it."
3,al who?,"i have never listened to this record and frankly dont intend to. all i know about al j. is that he is a jazz guy and loves to boogie down. i think he's really corny, but i'm not exactly sure why. it's funny how these preconceived notions enter our heads, without our knowledge. maybe he's the funk-nastiest doctor of groove that's ever cut vinyl. i dunno. maybe he's just too laid back for me to appreciate at this time in my life."
5,Yes. ..Yes. . .Yes. . .,"...Tomorrow Today was well worth the wait! Al showcases that smooth, caressing, classic voice with all those ""got me waiting with anticipation"" ranges his fans love to hear. Just listen to Just to Be Loved, Let Me Love You, and Flame --pure Al. Get it."
3,Still good!,"I was really waiting for a new album of Al Jarreau as I am a fan for more than 15 years. The only thing which is really disturbing is, that Al Jarreau doesn't use acoustic instuments but a 'stupid' drum machine - it kills all the emotion in this beautiful music!"
4,FOREVER AL! 4.75,"I join my fellow colleagues in praise of""TomorrowToday"". The only reason I didn't give it 5 starsis, because there really is no new material Jarreau fans haven't heard before.I concur with everyone on how brilliant ""Just To Be Loved"" is! This song would be a hit if some record exec had the ""cajones"" to release it. ""Let Me Love You"" is very sensual. ""Tomorrow Today"" would've been a wonderful addition to the CD ""This Time"". I would also highlight ""Flame"", ""Something That You Said"" and ""God's Gift To The World"".If you're a huge Jarreau fan this is a must. If your ears have been asleep all this time, here's your chance to hear some of what you've been missing. Enjoy, Alain"
1,buyer beware,"Watch out.This product is NOT COMPATIBLE with north americandvd players.It is ONLY suitable for region 2.Even if it is advertised on a north american website (U.S/CANADA),some not so bright individual ""forgot"" to have it encoded for region 1 for export purposes.You will waste time and money and end up with a useless productunable to enjoy it,and in this case also review it.All you will get is a ERROR display on your dvd player.Hopefully some day this otherwise fine war movie will be available locally in region 1 format,then maybe i'll be able to review it."
3,Defective right out of box,Product is defective right out of the box. Now I have to ship it to Samsung's service department to fix it. Poor quality control.
3,I was so surprised it was actually entertaining,"I bought this game because i am an adult that likes sesame street. I know what you gonna think what a dork. But don't judge the game and walk away from it just because its a little kids game. It really surprised me that it was actually entertaining. you can race as 6 different sesame street characters and they each have their own thing to race with. It does get boring after about an hour but its something to do when you bored or really frustrated with your other game. This game is good, easy and clean fun."
3,PS Sesame Street Sports,"Not a bad game, but meant for very young children. My son is 4 and it is very easy for him. He has fun, but it is a mindless game."
4,Boring,My 3 year old son was bored with this game after just 20 minutes. He never wants to play it. This was way too easy for him. It did not challenge him at all.
5,Life Changer,I had no idea what was making me overeat and be miserable. Now I do and it is quite a relief.
2,Not ot good,"Hello,I bought this 10X macro thinking that since it is a B+W product I would be a good one.It's only a 1 glass element macro, meaning that you get a considerable amount of distortion while using higher levels of zoom in your camera.I truly don't believe that this product deserves the price it has.Basically you are paying for the brand not the quality of the product.Trust me, you won't be happy with the results, I'm a amateur photographer, I've been taking pictures for some time..... You wont be happy using this macro, it was tested on different cameras and lenses."
4,Excellent reading,"Market Wizard Victor Sperandeo's simple rules for trading success, risk management, and other concepts are well worth the price of this and his other books."
5,Vic has done it again,This is a great book and should be read to the very end. Usually when an author puts out a first book that is great the 2nd book falls short. This the second book is every bit as good as the first book. Thanks Vic - I hope to one day have the pleasure of meeting you in person.
4,Fundamentals start here,"FUNdamental, entertaining reading; fundaMENTAL, he gets you to think and not just throw your money out there like a gambler; fundamental, some basic principles that everyone should learn start right here; fundaMEntal, there's something here for everybody; funDAMEntal, for the girls; fundaMENtal, and the guys; FUNDamental, it's a business and it's about learning to preserve capital."
2,Trader Vic I is much better,"I rated Vic I a 5 stars. However, I dont see any reason for the existence of Vic II, which just primarily repeated what had been covered in its predecessor. Hope you had read this review before you buy and read Vic II. Just go directly to Vic I! It's a great read."
5,Health Valley Crackers,An excellent gluten-free snack. I highly recommend it.It makes a great mid-morning snack....closet thing totasting like graham crackers...just sweet enough to satisfyyour sweet tooth.
1,Taste like varnish,"It seems like most of the good reviews were pre-2010 or early 2010.. dont know what changed, but these crackers taste strangely like varnish or paint thinner as was mentioned in a prior review. yucky yuckness."
5,Convenient & Quick,This is a product that I would go way out of my way to get until I discovered it on Amazon. I am wheat intolerant and I love these crackers which are made out of rice. I am very happy overall with my purchase.
1,Crackers have changed - Can I give 0 stars...,"I have been enjoying these crackers for a couple of years. In August I received a shipment in which some of the cracker packs smelled and tasted terrible. The smell reminded me of paint thinner. I allowed my subscription to send another 2 cases in October. The date on the cases is Nov 30. I opened one box from each of the cases, and they both have the stale paint thinner type odor. I e-mailed Health Valley a week ago on their web site, but received no response. I am very disapointed in what used to be a good product."
1,Stale and broken,"I have used these crackers for years and like them but can't buy locally so I ordered a case. I still had a box to finish and didn't open the first box from this order until a month after receiving them. I have thrown out all 6 boxes! I purchased from Amazon the middle of August, the expiration date on the boxes is November 2010. They should still been OK. All 6 boxes had broken crackers and smelled very stale and tasted awful. Unfortunately, they can't be returned so I am out the $20 for them, and I don't have my favorite snack cracker."
2,Like eating dirt,"I buy a lot a gluten free items, and even the ones my kids don't like I usually like. The kids spit these out after the first bite. I thought, it can't be that bad....well they are! Gritty, sandpaper-like texture with bitter after taste. The film stays on your tough for many minutes after dissolving because you can't really swallow as they're so dry they stick to your tongue, roof and side of your mouth. I'll stick to making my gluten free sugar cookies."
3,Could be better,This book was recommended to me by a friend and although I have found it useful. I have also found it neccessary to cross reference it with other sources for examples that are explainatory. This book has very poor examples. The examples are either too simple or too complicated and there are not enough of them.... Of course the nice thing about a book is that you can read it anywhere anytime like I did after buying it. In my opinion every command listed should site examples of how all options for a command should and can be used but that is rarely seen.
5,MUST HAVE! Best tips/tricks for command line use in NT,"Mr. Hill has finally documented what IT types need, a comprehensive (if there is more, I probably don't need it) guide to using the command line in Windows NT. This is a MUST HAVE for anyone who wants, needs or just likes to use the command line to automate tasks. It shows that MS did not forget about DOS and have spent time enhancing it for NT.Thank you VERY MUCH, Mr. Hill, for your in-depth coverage. I've put this book to good use on many ocassions and will expect to do so again. I also bought copies for my integration engineers for when we deployed NT apps.If you use NT more than just casually, DO NOT PASS ON THIS BOOK! A must have for your library."
1,DOES NOT FIT GAME GEAR!!,THIS DOES NOT FIT THE GAME GEAR!! DO NOT GET THIS PRODUCT IF YOU DONT HAVE GAME BOY. THIS IS NOT A SEGA GAME GEAR PRUDUCT.
4,Slaughter Rocks!,"I enjoyed their last two albums(Fear No Evil and Revolution) but ""Back To Reality"" is one great listen! ""Dangerous"" and ""Trailer Park Boogie"" are the hardest Slaughter has ever rocked! Actually, the first 5 songs on this album are metal heaven! Nice change of pace on the last two cuts."
3,A must own!,This album Rocks! Definitely a different sound for Slaughter then we are use to hearing from back in the day. The new guitarist Jeff Blando brings a different sound - and it's awesome. Blando baby you smoke!!!!
1,Spoilt by transfer,"Very interesting to see a serial 70 years old, particularly asit's shot mostly outdoors. A great pity this is spoilt by tape2 which has projection shudder (not video shudder) .Apparently no one was watching when this was being transfered from film. Very poor work. Not customer orientated at all.Advice give it a miss."
2,Very disappointing,"Having recently finished the Cooper novel, I looked forward with anticipation to watching this film version of ""The Last of the Mohicans."" What a mistake that was, because this movie is lacking in several areas. Foremost, for me, was the fact that the film strayed very far away from the plot and storyline of the original. Not only were the fates of the characters changed dramatically, but a completely new character was created for this film. Needless to say, this was an unwanted surprise.As if that weren't bad enough, the quality of the film itself was rather poor, both audio and video. Spoken words were often either garbled or missing entirely. The film sometimes was spliced or ""shook"" for a few seconds. Taken altogether, it made for an unenjoyable viewing experience.I give this two stars, only because it is so old (1932). But I cannot recommend it."
4,Awesome!!!,This is wayyyyy better than replacing the batteries every so often. Hours and hours of non stop fun :) I woild recommend it to anyone who has doubts.
3,Could use some improvement,"The power flow wasn't very fluent. My GameBoy Advance kept restarting itself, something it never did before. Also, whenever I plugged it in to my GBA, the sound had a lot of static. I suggest getting the Nintendo AC Adapter - it works much better. Other than that, it was fine for casual use."
1,Not for classic Gameboy,"I wish I had read ALL of the reviews. This AC adapter does not fit a classic gray Gameboy. It should say that in the description, I wouldn't have bought it if I knew that. By the time I paid for the shipping and the return shipping, this thing ended up costing me money, not a lot but a waste of time and money none the less. Let the buyer beware."
5,corny but wonderful,"When the day comes that all we have is junk on TV, Oh that day is here, we can turn to the movies with a message without the need for violence, profanity or sex. The scouts love to sit and watch the series. Just recently gave them a taste of the first two chapters and they left the meeting wanting more. Use it as a reward, a lesson or just plain fun. Very enjoyable."
3,Old Serial,"This is a fun old serial and I enjoyed it, only issue it won't play on my blu-ray player whilst all my other DVD's do, suggests they are not using standardised formatting, it works on PC."
1,Boring,"I purchased this CD for a party and it was very disappointing. Only 4 songs which it says, but I never heard the songs before. Not good at all."
3,Not Enough nudes,There is not enough nudes of males and females in great arrangement.Please do better in the future. It is very sad that the DVD is so sad.God Know What I Am Talking About!
1,boring and ill-conceived,"This is what happens when you approach industrial music with some interesting ideas, but no talent. The voice samples could have been cool if they had been accompanied with good music; unfortunately, the songs are poorly structured, rambling, repetitive, and go nowhere. The mixing is abysmal and I found the whole disc to be a poorly thought out mess with no redeeming tracks. For better industrial in a similar vein, try Front Line Assembly (and its various side projects), My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult, or Skinny Puppy. Avoid this disc at all costs."
5,AWESOME BOOK !!!,"I own hundreds of football coaching books and this might be the most useful I have ever read. Don't be confused by the title, the best part of the book is it's detailed description of picking apart coverages, and the 80 series passing game. This is a must have for any football coach."
4,Pass Pro Solved,"Coach, thanks for writing this book. It certainly solved the problem I was having with pass protection at my high school. The concept is easy for the kids to understand. The pass packages improved what we were trying to do in the passing game. They gave us more diversity. We improved from 2-8 to 7-3 with just average athletes."
4,What the hands reveal about the brain,"Considering how difficult it must be to study how the different areas of the human brain are used to process language and more specifically sign language I think the authors did an admirable job. I would have preferred a full-page drawing of the human brain showing by location which aspect of sign language seemed to specialize for which area. Since this was the goal of the research it would have made it clearer to follow the author's conclusions. I came away with a renewed sense of wonder for the marvelous resilliancy and redundancy of the human brain that even after something so devestating as a stroke for some people other areas of the brain eventually adapted and retrained itself to take over jobs that it would not normally do. If you want to learn sign language and exactly how it works this is not the book for you. This book excells in a rather narrow, but fascinating field."
5,excellent product,"Very comfortable shorts, convenient, well made, everything is as advertised with these. Second pair i've had, and i will definitely buy more."
4,SO much fun!!!,We had a group of people and had the best time playing this game! Even people who hate board games love this game.
5,WARNING: Game can cause endless nights of fun!,"My friends and I played this game during our Christmas Party. I bought this game after reading all the positive reviews on this site and I am glad I did. We spent at least 3-4 hours playing this game. I think it took longer because we took so many breaks in between the game. But needless to say it was highly entertaining and is a great way to ""break the ice"" with people you don't know very well."
2,"a little on the oddball side, but interesting","This book has a variety of applications of heat and light for healing, many anecdotal, including human and veterinary uses. The plus is that it is based on personal experience, the minus is that it sometimes feels odd ball and hearsay, and I would have liked more in the way of scientific support. The book is part of my exploration of laser and infra-red healing and is a bit eccentric."
1,Jazz Masters,"DVD WOULD NOT PLAY, I THINK IT WAS FOR EUROPEAN MARKET. SOULD HAVE BEEN CHECKED BERORE SENT.ASKED TWICE IF THEY WERE SENDING A PLAYABLE DVD & NEVER GOT A REPLY JUST RETURN INSTRUCTIONS."
3,good customer service,"I couldn`t view this dvd because of wrong zone.I wrote them and got a very quick response,sent back the dvd at their expense. My money was returned in a few days so I would buy from this seller again"
1,"Never Got To Watch This Due To Viewing ""Glitch""","Based on other reviews, I was really looking forward to seeing this DVD. When I received it, there was an error message saying to remove the DVD because the ""region"" was not authorized. I called Amazon and was told that it was not to be viewed in Asia, and because I'm in the U.S., I should be able to view it. They immediately sent out a replacement DVD and a postage-paid return label. When I received the replacement DVD, I got the same error message. (I've viewed many other DVDs from Amazon without having this problem.) When I called for the second time, Amazon suggested a refund of my payment, which I accepted with disappointment. I'm not sure how other U.S. folks managed to view the DVD. I wish I could have! I'm hoping this review will cause someone to look into the problem."
5,A Classic Exposition on the History of Strength,"I first read this book over 30 years ago in the Cardinal O'Hara High School library, it's chock full of factoids strength fans young and old will find amazing. My favorite section is Miscellaneous Feats of Strength as it records ""Working Man Strength"" this is not a compendium of weightlifting or powerlifting totals, this book is a broad coverage of strength in all it's manifestations. Some examples:Hugo Lauffer...carried two pieces of baggage total of 132 pounds, from Vienna to Paris (750 miles) in 25 days!Crispus Maltese .......within the space of 30 minutes carried 35 barrels each 250 pounds up 3 flight of stairs! I doubt I could do 35 trips up three flights of stairs sans barrels in 30 minutes!Mike Mahoney carried a small piano of 150 pounds over a mountain a distance of 1/3 of a mileAll the old time masters are here too!This is a classic work and should be in every lifters library!"
2,Boring!!,I was very disappointed in this DVD. This is the first time I have purchased something that didn't already have a review and I won't do that again. Except for the parts featuring Terry Fator (which is really why I bought this DVD) this is very BORING! It features the struggles of Ventriloquists 'trying to make it' and their sad stories. It is obvious Terry Fator is one-in-a-million in this field. Again very disappointed in this DVD--I wonder how much I will get for it selling it to Half-price books?
1,disappointed,We were disappointed in this video. We thought it would have more comedy in it. It was just a documentary and not entertaining at all. We ended up turning it off.
5,A great performance!,"This was a great performance of Verdi's seldom seen opera, I due Foscari. Linda Roark-Strummer's passionate portrayal of Lucrezia Conarini was a marvel. I'd call her the star of this production. But Renato Bruson as Francesco Foscari, the aging Doge, was equally wonderful. The sets, costumes and supporting cast were quite splendid also. It's too bad the story is such a downer."
4,Morir per la Patria,"Quite old this performance, from 1988. Magisterially conducted by Gavazzeni and soberly produced in gran tradition.Here is Bruson at his summit,introverged, reflective, with fine legato and drammatic impact. The tenor Cupido is conventional, often pleasant. The soprano Linda Roak Strummmer puts her heart into her role in a wild way,her vocal effects are uneven and often conventional."
2,Pure Fiction,"This comes across as a piece of fiction, a ""yarn"" spun by a sailor and turned into a book. Much of what is written in the book repeats itself, and since the ""names and names of the ships were changed,"" it leaves you to wonder if it even happened at all. It all sounds exaggerated, to the point where you stop taking it seriously. Having been overseas during the Gulf War, I can tell you there is NO WAY two Merchant Seamen could have found Army uniforms and a jeep and snuck off the piers. Some of his stories are real, but it's about 60/40 with the fiction. Don't take this as a true account of life aboard an American Merchant Ship."
3,Union Mariners,"I found this book entertaining at first, with Sea-stories that I could relate to. But as the book moved on I noticed the stories repeating themselves, and as with any good drinking session, it burned out.I have sailed with union and non union ships. There is definately more wild stories with union sailors, especially the union sailors that have always been with the union from the start and don't know anything else. This book's take is all union.I reccomend reading it, but don't think the Merchant Marine is full of odd-balls."
1,Amateurish. Waste of $$$,"Jumbled, disconnected, rambling. Badly written. Not very coherent . You can get a general sense of being in the merchant marine out of it but somehow it just disappoints. One ""chapter"" is just a quote from another book. Another ""chapter"" is a collection of short (1 or 2 sentence) anecdotes/sea tales, many of which are fabrications or jokes. Not a serious attempt at literature and not even a very good exposition of life as a mariner. For the price it is very disappointing."
3,It's okay for what it's supposed to do but otherwise...,"This Game Boy Color light does a good job of magnifying the screen and lighting up the dark. But the thing is, the batteries run out too fast, and the light keeps getting dimmer the more the battery runs out making it useless about halfway through. The screen also smudges a little too easily. It's a good item to have for night travel, just make sure you have a fresh pair of AAA batteries."
2,i am 14.,I have one of these things and it is really really hard to get back off the gameboy. So before i take it off i cut off my game just in case i accidentally rip the game out along with it the lights dont last long if you are playing a game such as pokemon and you play it for a period of time and the magnifer yeah it works but the lights glare off the game boy and somtimes you want the magnifier in a certain place and it will not go in that place.
1,It is not worth it,this is the worst product i have ever used. it failed so many times i was about to throw it out but i exchaged it for somthing else and my mom rebought it for me for christmas.i was so ... off. take my advice and either exchage it or throw it out. it would only work for 20 min. and it stop . i dont know why they dont do something about it. DONT BUY ONE BELEIVE ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Helps to see screen easier,It really does magnify the screen and lights it up as well. Nice addition for a child who like to play the gameboy a lot.
1,bigger and still black,"although this little diddy seems to make the picture bigger, its still too dark to see and makes for games that require fast hand movement such as tony hawk 2 impossible to play, as things are just as blurry and dark as before."
1,Does not even fit on my gameboy and light does not turn on.,This says that it is for a Gameboy Color and it doesnt even fit on mine. Complete waste of ten dollars.The light cant even turn on.
5,Dance the night away,"If you're a dance music fan like myself who's never been to Ibiza, this two cd compilation will bring you just a little closer, with a fabulous imagination ofcourse, and a penchant for jumping and moving to the groove of songs too delicious to ignore. This cd is totally worth the bucks. Buy this piece of import treasure and you'll be the coolest american around !"
4,Really good book for designers,"I recomend for interaction designers, not for web designers only, but for anybody in digital medium."
2,Rather Boring for Me,"While I generally enjoy what little I've heard of from Popov, I found both of these works rather forgettable. I thoroughly enjoy his other available symphonies, # 1 & # 2, # 6, and the more recently available # 3 for Strings.Hopefully, there will be some future CD's of his other works!"
2,The controls get in the way.,I thought this game would be like Diablo. It looks good but the controls get in the way. To move the character you must use the arrow keys. If you don't mind using the keys you will have a similar experience to Diablo gameplay.
4,informative,"McLachlan 1996 paper was retracted and the 1st edition was written prior to the retraction.Very informative on how the EPA works (or doesn't work) and the tactics used by the Chemical companies to mislead.The precedent established in this book about how Monsanto (Pharmacia) and Zeneca (now Syngenta) act and their lack of concern for people should be kept in mind during the discussion of GMO foods where Monsanto and Syngenta are prime movers.The book was informative, however, I would check out a copy at the library instead of buying."
1,Toxic Deception book simply deceptive,"The enthusiasm of your reviewers for Toxic Deception is unwarranted.This volume is far from a reliable guide to the science and politics of environmental health risks. Let one example suffice. Research from Science (7 June,1996) is characterized by the authors in the following manner; ""A recent study of the effects of ... pesticides on estrogen-sensitive cells in test tubes, for example, found that the pesticides were 1,000 times more potent in combination than individually.""The research in question was formally retracted by its authors in Science, on 25 July 1997. The episode was widely discussed and led to an ethics investigation by Tulane University. Toxic Deception was published in 1999. That news of this development took two years to reach the authors stretches plausibility. Moreover, the same environmental foundation (W. Alton Jones) which funded the retracted study likewise supported the publication of Toxic Deception."
2,Scratched screen first DAY!!!,"This watch is very nice looking but the screen is plastic so it scratched from day 1 and makes the watch basically useless, avoid buying this crappy watch and save money on a glass screen watch, im very disappointed to say the least."
3,Good beginning but slow,"I had no trouble getting into this book and was looking forward to a good read, but about a third of the way through the plot slowed down and I grew increasingly bored until the ending, which I read but found implausible. All in all, I thought the writing and style were good but I didn't get attached to any of the characters and didn't find myself caring about the outcome."
5,Great Experience,"Let me say this, after an agonizingly painful and bloody few months of trying all different types of Anal Douche Systems, (plastic, electric, stainless steel, and plexiglass) I can't tell how much of a relief this product is to my anus. This really is the ""Ultimate"" ""anal douche hygienic system"". Not only does it leave ::pirate accent:: ""me squeaky"" clean! it is great for a variety of uses like to use on my wife during the act of love making or mixing cake batter for my son's twelfth birthday. The rectal probes fit comfortably and are very easy to clean and store. If you're looking for an excellent Anal Douche System with personality, this is for you."
1,a big bust,Way too expensive for what it is. A cheap plastic gadget. The rubber bulb douches are much better and much cheaper. A big ZERO!
2,A lot of academic jargon,"This book is not really worth reading. It's loaded with academic jargon, and it skips around a lot. It starts off well, but overall, the book is boring and hard to follow."
4,Brahms bien servi.,"Une interprétation appliquée de la part de ces jeunes musiciens, et somme toute une musique respectueuse de l'esprit brahmsien. Prise de son claire et détaillée mais manquant un peu de densité de timbres. Un disque à conseiller aux amoureux de la musique de chambre de Mr Brahms."
5,if you only buy one motley album....,"ironically, my favorite motley crue album by a long shot is the one the band itself seems to want to pretend never existed!....growing up on ""dr. feelgood,"" i remember being depressed that motley crue had ""given in to grunge"" the first time i heard ""hooligan's holiday"" on the radio--but i wanted to check out how the new singer pulled it off on the rest of the album....and i was INSTANTLY blown away! ....every track on this disc is incredible--songs like ""uncle jack,""""welcome to the numb,""""droppin like flies,""and ""'til death do us part"" made it impossible to hold a grudge over the firing/quitting/whatever of vince neil....i know this is stepping into dangerous territory with the hardcore, shout-at-the-devil, vincenikkitommymick-forever crowd, but they made a big mistake turning their backs on this album (and singer)...of the nearly 2,000 cds i have, if i had to pick 5 to listen to for the rest of my life, this would easily be one of them..."
4,What A Find,"Generally I would not take the time to write a review, but upon listening to this CD over and over, I just had to jump on and encourage more to jump on it. It is outstanding!!!! Treat yourself to this one, you WILL NOT regret it."
5,The Very Best of HEAVY Rock Music MOTLEY CRUE,"MOTLEY CRUE (self titled)has to be one of the best albums I have ever purchased. These recordings are the best, the best CD, all the songs are perfect.Keep this music Rocking. The vocals, the guitar, the bass,lead guitar all up top with Led Zep, Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix, etc, Legends. I jammed drums with Motley Crue in Melbourne Australia at the Central Club in Richmond Melbourne in 1993. It was the best Jam I have ever had however I was under the influence of the bass player of another band I was playing in at the time so i did'nt tour.WELL DONE CHAMPIONS.KEEP ON ROCKIN'"
5,Could be the best CRUE album ever!!!,"This disk is amazing. All the songs just have a groove that keeps you coming back for more. Uncle Jack, Loveshine, Welcome to the Numb and Poison Apples are my fav's on this one. I remember when this came out in 94, Soundgarden just released Superunknown with Spoonman as thier first single. Hooligan's Holiday was also the first Crue single released at almost the same time, and it never seemed to get any airplay against Soundgarden. This disk was a shock for all us Motley Crue fans waiting for -- as a previous reviewer put it ""Dr. Feelgood II""I love this disk! John was truly a breath of fresh air for Motley. Tommy, Mick & Nikki sound amazing. Bob Rock's brillant production cannot be forgotten as well. I keep wondering what Generation Swine what have sounded like if John was still with the Crue. Vince just dosen't sound right on that disk. Do yourself a favour and buy this disk, you won't be disappointed."
1,There is a reason why this album is forgotten,"and the reason is this album is CRAP enough said and to those who say this is the Crue""s best album that statement just proves you know nothing about music that is a fact and it is undisputed"
4,Heaviest CrueAlbum!,John Corabi Rules! I didn't know what to think when this album came out i ignored it like many until a year and a half ago when i decided to complete my collect with this cd. WOW!! Was i amazed. Never were the Crue as more aggressive as this release. They should have played these live with Vince What were they thinking. I now regret not picking this disc up when it came out. I wish i saw them with Corabi. Excellent cd 4 1/2 stars.
4,killer crue,"without a doubt their best record since shout, john corabi brings the crue to a new level that was only hinted on feelgood. maybe their heaviest record as well due to bob rock's punishing production - tommy lee has never sounded better. his drums alone make this album worth buying. corabi adds a whole new wall of sound with his strong throat, a second guitar and as a second songwriter which nikki obviously took full advantage of. i don't want to point out standout tracks because this record flows beautifully. just listening to ""hooligan's holiday"" alone will give you an idea what you're in for..."
4,the BEST yet,"this is the best CRUE cd i ever heard. John's vocals puts power behind the music. i feel he is alot better then Vince's hellium sounded vocals. Nikki's bass playing is awesome. i wish they would kept John. like the song say's ""Power to the music...in the streets""...my fave!"
5,powerful,"J Krishnamurti was a (is a) brilliant human being whose words, always in the form of a conversation, were about bringing to the conscious mind and exposing those things we assume about our selves, our lives, and reality. Always deeply examining these assumptions from a logical perspective and seeing through the hypnotic fog of cultural, national, and social associations and identifications that keep us from recognizing who we truly are and that we are all the same.In these writings Krishnamurti has a conversation with the reader (as he always states he is merely the speaker and each of us is to come to our own conclusions) about our state of being, individually and collectively. It is deeply introspective and can be scary as hell at times. Since reality is relative, it is up to the reader to decide what degree of ""Freedom from the Known"" he/she has the courage to create/live/sustain."
3,thanks for the service,"I wish, I would be able to get a book where someone has not written his openin on the book itself. However, a book may be an old one or turned, I don't mine as I cannot afford to buy a new one. It is very painful to see people spit their thoughts on the books. If a reader is smart S/he will either write an openion or a book against or in favor. I even don't like to underline in a book unless it's in my course and I do with pencil.Freedom from the Known"
5,Excellent but brutal,One of the few books I've read that I recommend time and time again to my students - an excellent but brutal analysis of the human condition.It is certainly not light reading and I found it to be quite pessimistic in terms of its overall outlook. The analysis however is clinical and cuts to the bone. This book would probably bode better with intellectuals than those inclined to read the standard self-help motivational pulp.. definitely a book to stimulate thought and reflection.
1,Complete waste,This book is filled with unsupportable psycho dribble. It is virtually entirely focused on individual fault and negativity.The only positive thing I can say about this book is that it is mercifully only 124 pages long.This is the first book I've read in years that went straight to the waste recycling bin.
4,True Living,Real.True.Simple. This is the basis of life that's revealed in this book. Great read and wise advice.
1,Garbage,"Gangsta Boo is one of my favorite female rappers (checc reviews of her other albums) but this album is not hitting. The production on the album is terrible and her signature flow is almost nonexistent. Even her lyrics are wack on this album. One of the freestyles she did was horrendous and I'm wondering how it made the album. Then I started wondering how much time was actually put into the final product. The first three songs are the only good songs: Sippin & Spinnin, Zoned Out, and Scared, The rest are throwaway tracks. Hopefully this is only a bump in the road for Lady Gangsta Boo, cause she has the potential to release great albums. Not recommended. 1.5 stars"
4,Boo's Back!,You have to show love to the lady. She left her previoous represtatives that she'd grown up with and started her own label with a sick cartel. Her artists (featured on this CD) are smart in sticking with Boo. She's living proof that women can kick in the door and stay in the game for longevity. This album is tight. It's a must-have for all Gangsta Boo fans.
4,Soft soap with Aloe,Soft soap is a good hand soap.It is winter and washing your hands can dry your skin.The aloe Vera keeps your hands softer and free from painful cracking.
5,I Love this Book!,Incredible photographs of elegant simplicity. Anulka and Brenda have imparted grace and ease in an un-easy world. My guests have all looked through the book with oooh's and ahhhhh's.I have already been inspired to evolve my own flower arrangements.I LOVE this book!
3,Not on par with earlier efforts.,"While the production of this CD is really good, and the performances are flawless (as is usually the case with Styx), the songwriting of Brave New World proves to be it's major flaw. Not that any of the songs are bad, there is just nothing here that I would call memorable.I have had this CD for over a year now and listened to it numerous times, and to this day there is only one song that I remember enough about to hum...that song is ""Everything Is Cool"".If you remember the Styx of ""Renegade"" and ""Miss America"", you may be a bit disappionted. If you prefer the ""Edge Of The Century"" you may like this.Not a bad album, just a little uninspired."
2,I think this is the end.,"There are tones of OLD Styx in this album, but if you want old Styx, buy their old stuff. I think this is a modernized sound for them, and I think it is also the end of them. Denis DeYoung sounded a little too ambiguous as he was saying Goodbye [to] Roseland. I certainly liked this album, but Paradise Theatre will be my #1 Styx album for a long time."
5,"Styx back and updated for a ""Brave New World""","How to sum up a 14 song CD in 1000 words? Well, the first word that comes to mind is diversity. This album moves from hard rock to gospel to a soft ballad to hip-hop and so on. It is driven by Tommy Shaw and James Young but Dennis DeYoung's offerings provide the capstone to an excellent effort. If you're looking for a 70s sound its not here! This is a new and improved Styx and the album really demonstrates the personal growth the members have gone through in the last sixteen years. One of the best albums these guys have ever done. Not ""Paradise Theater"" but definitely a must have especially if you're a Tommy Shaw fan."
1,Why?,"This is not the ""comeback"" we need. Nails on a chalkboard vocals, pompous production, and stupid lyrics. It is all formula and no talent."
4,Classic Styx proves that Real Rock is what its all about!,"Styx turns in a very good peformance on this CD. This is more a Tommy Shaw CD than any other, and rightfully so. Truly a rockin' set. If you remember Styx from the 70's and early 80's, this CD of all new music is a must for your collection. Real Rock and New music!"
4,"Hey it sounds like Styx to me, but what do I know?","Ok, so shoot me, I like it. Not every song on this album is an absolute gem, but all are worth a listen! I think both Dennis DeYoung and Tommy Shaw came up with songs with interesting, insightful lyrics. Personally, I found The title track, Brave New World to be the best on the album. most Styx-like and well, it just gets to me. Worth the price of admission, easily. And if you like ballads..well While There's Still time is one of Dennis DeYoung's all time best. Other wonderful songs include Great Expectations and Everything is Cool. Listen and Enjoy."
4,Everything is cool on the Brave New STYX CD,"Brave New World is a very solid collection from one of the all time great rock bands. I am very impressed, but it is not quite as good as The Grand Illusion or Paradise Theater.All in all it is a very good CD. ""Everything Is Cool"" is an instant Styx classic."
5,Destined to be a Classic!,"Most of your classic albums/CD's usually have a few really good songs on them. This one has quite a few. Although I agree with many reviewers that it has to grow on you, for me it did not take long at all. I saw an interview with Tommy Shaw awhile back and he said that the new CD would would be a nice mix of new and old Styx. He was right on the money. My favorite song on here is tough because they have quite a few really good ones. If I had to pick I would choose ""Brave New World"", followed by ""Everything is Cool"", ""What Have They Done To You"", ""Heavy Water"", ""Number One"", ""I Will Be Your Witness"", ""Just Fell In"", ""Best New Face"" and even Dennis DeYoung's mellow ""While There's Still Time"" is pretty good. This new CD does rock. I encourage radio stations, across the country,to give this new Styx CD consideration. Many Styx fans won't be disappointed."
5,Styx as good as ever,"I bought this album after hearing samples of Brave New World. After my 1st listen through the album I was still unsure as to whether I really liked the album or not. After listening to it many times since I have to give credit to the guys for being willing to mix some new sounds with some familiar sounds. Dennis DeYoung and Tommy Shaw still have outstanding talent. The rest of the group, in particular James Young, are tight and contribute a huge amount to this album. I strongly recommend this album to any Styx fans out there."
2,What happened to Styx?,"Please help me out here. I am a huge Styx fan, but I have only marginally enjoyed the solo stuff. This CD is the solo stuff - there's not much Styx here. I have only listened to it once, so maybe things will change drastically on the next few listens.I'm having a hard time swallowing all the five star ratings from longtime Styx fans. Just because you want a CD to be great doesn't make it great.Styx will always be my favorite band, but this effort will go right next to ""Edge of the Century"" in my book."
4,"Not their best, not their worst.","Being a Styx fan for many years, my expectations for the album were probably a little high. Especially after so many years apart. Some of the songs are very good, but some are just so-so. I have to agree with many of the reviewers that Tommy Shaw's and JY's tracks are the highlights. Dennis' songs are okay, but they sound a bit like he is tired (possibly from his illness). I'm not sure I hear a hit on the album, but the album as a whole makes a nice sequence. If you don't hear it go back and read Aldous Huxley's ""Brave New World"". Hope they don't stop now."
4,"OK, I Listened Some More and It's Growing on Me!","I wrote one of the initial reviews to ""Brave New World"" stating that maybe Styx' time had passed (two star review). This was based on two full listens to the CD. However, I found myself very much in the minority when I read some of the other reviews. I took a very long driving vacation over the holiday and listened to the CD another three times. I have to say that ""Brave New World"" is growing on me. Highlights are ""Everything is Cool"", ""Heavy Water"" and ""Just Fell In"" (OK - Just Fell In is silly, but it's fun). I'm not crazy about a couple of cuts, especially ""Number One"" and ""High Crimes and Misdemeanors"", but all in all, I think I overreacted in my initial review and believe a retraction is in order.Hopefully, we haven't seen the last of these guys!"
2,Album really isn't that great,"This is a response to the writer from California, who wanted to hear from fans that weren't as crazy about this record as some reviewers. Well, he's right--this record is very inconsistent and reflects the fragmented way it was written and recorded. The only songs where Styx remotely sounds like a unit are ""BNW"", ""Everything is Cool"", and ""Best New Face"". The rest are split into Tommy and Dennis tracks with the obligatory one James Young song, and it's pretty clear which of these writers are lazing around on past habits and which have kept making new rock music. I mean, which track from Hunchback will Dennis mine next for the band, ""Hey Quasimodo""?In any case, this disc gets changed after ""Heavy Water"" pretty much every time I play it, and most of the time ""Fallen Angel"" gets skipped too. Five stars to Styx for finishing the new record and clearly making many fans happy. But a more realistic 2 stars for the actual quality of the product."
1,Where has the genius gone?,"What happened to their ""come sail away"", ""fooling yourself"", ""blue collar man"", ""boat on the river"", ""half penny..."", ""rockin the ..."", etc.? What happened to the covers? Where has their talent gone? They became as monotonous as the music from this decade. I am an old fan of them, but I'll keep listening their old records, or even Glen Burtnik solo projects. What happened with Glen?, I prefer Tommy, but Glen wasn't bad. Styx is going like Supertramp, from great to bad.I write this because I expected so much from my favorite band, but got nothing."
2,"(Really 2 1/2 stars) Great music, horrible lyrics","I am a long time fan whose favorite Styx album is ""Paradise Theater"". In 1980, there was no other album that really matter. In fact I still listen to it today. Now, in 1999, Styx has released ""Brave New World"". It is the first album in 16 years that Tommy Shaw has appeared on. As I read the lyrics I cringed. I put on the CD and enjoyed the music but cringed even more when I heard these horribly trite and dated lyrics. Imagine if the Backstreet Boys had been a rock band rather than a dance pop band with the same type of lyrics and then you will understand. The songs that Tommy Shaw and James Young sings on are the best. Dennis DeYoung's songs are somewhat sappily embarrasing. ""Goodbye Roseland"" sounds like it belongs in a Broadway play and not on a rock album. If I were 10 years old ago again (when ""Paradise Theater"" came out) I probably would have loved this album but now that I am 29 I can't."
4,THE LAST REAL STYX ALBUM,while growing up one of my favorite bands was thrilled to deathwhen the core of the original band reunited.even more thrilled they were doing a new album. great songs not enough DENNISbut well rounded songs good balance of rockers and ballads.WHILE THERES STILL TIME beautiful harmonies by SHAW/and DEYOUNG.true styx sound.TOMMYS songs are pretty good not his best.J.Y.sucks as always. He always was the weakest link of the band. it was always best when he just played guitar.BRAVE NEW WORLD is a really good song as well as EVERY THING IS COOL.GOOD BYE TO ROSELAND is the best song on the disc.Should have closed the album there but SHAW and J.Y. had to ruin it with that crappy reprise.Then the egotistically combination of TOMMY SHAW and JAMES YOUNG fired DENNIS and STYX was and still is finished how do you get rid of the man who made the band.BRAVE NEW WORLD indeed.
1,Painful,"Being a Styx fan for a number of years I was excited to see the remaining members of the group reunite for another studio album. However, after hearing this sub-par effort from the Styx makes me wish they would have forgone the effort and stuck to their day jobs.With pointless lyrics and musical arrangements that put you to sleep it is safe to say that the magic that this band once had has gone the way of the dodo.This is a perfect example that sometimes living in the past is not such a bad thing. If you feel the need to hear Styx wipe off your turntable and listen to some of the old classics.""Brave New World"" makes their single ""Music Time"" sound like Beethoven."
3,TOO MUCH SHAW,"I LIKE THIS CD, BUT THER IS TOO MUCH TOMMY SHAW ON HERE. SEEMSLIKE HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THIS TO PUT MORE OF HIS SOLO MATERIAL TO AN ALBUM. IT'S A DIVERSE ALBUM. TOO DIVERSE. IT HAS ITS MOMENTS""HEAVY WATER',""GOODBYE ROSELAND"" AND ITS FAILURES ""JUST FELL IN"" I LISTEN TO IT FROM TIME TO TIME. BUT IT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER"
1,Can we give zero stars?,"Awful, awful, awful. Disconnected, non-STYX sounding, way too many bad songs, no cohesion..need I say more? Was a major disappointment sales-wise, had no hits. After you listen to it you will know why. The last good STYX album was Edge of the Century. The last great STYX album was Paradise Theatre. Tommy Shaw returned and STYX went in the toliet."
1,Lame,"Styx has always been a fun, if musically lightweight band, but this new cd is terrible. It sounds like a lame Tommy Shaw solo album combined with a lame Dennis DeYoung solo album. Shaw's voice is almost gone, as are his songwriting skills. Where's the great harmonies of years past? There's nothing memorable at all here."
2,Too polished.STYX seem to have lost their passion.No GUTS,"What has happened to STYX? When I heard they were releasing a new album I almost started salivating with anticipation but when I finally heard it my mouth went as dry as the sahara desert. I could not believe how trite and insipid it was. The songwriting alone represents a major comedown in standards. Not one of the tracts on this album is at all memorable.In the past,we could always depend on James Young and Tommy Shaw to dish out the rock, (remember tracks like RENEGADE-MISS AMERICA-BLUE COLLAR MAN?)but not any more. Alas another great band sacrifices their guts and glory and opts for total,banal commercialism. WHAT A WASTE."
3,"Not a greater than others albums, but still is Styx","I'm very disapointment because there are not a together job between Tommy and Dennis, like good old times, but still, the music preserve the essence of Styx. I'm an old fan since 20 years ago of this band, and I'm still waiting for a better new piece, like Pieces of Eight, Cornerstone, or Grand Illusion. Maybe, when Dennis and Tommy agree to do something together, the world can be ear again the really Styx sound."
2,Did not care for almost all of Tommy Shaw's material.,True Styx fan's will be terribly disappointed. There are only three songs on the whole CD that I would even classify as Styx music.
3,Brave New World for Styx means a more stripped down sound .,"3 1/2 to 4 STARS.....A big departure from the Styx sound of the late 70's and 80's. There is really none of the 4 1/2 minute 'power-pop' songs that Styx is known for. Gone also is a lot of the 'layering' sounds of Dennis DeYoung's keyboards in every song. What REMAINS is a CD of eclectic musical styles. As always the musicianship is first rate as are the production values. It is a CD that does tend to grow on you with repeated listenings. The CD does favor Tommy Shaw's material more than previous offerings. That is what seems missing the most is the normal division of songs between Tommy and Dennis. In all, not a bad CD and a very welcome addition to any fans collection. The songs seem more destined for AOR radio then many of the pop stations of today. THAT more than anything shows how Styx appreciates their fans maturing along with their sound."
5,Brave New World,"I've been a Styx fann for years. I didn't even know this CD existed and was anxious to give a listen. The first time I listened to the entire CD, I wasn't sure if I liked it or not. It's definately a different sound, but as I listened to it 2nd time on another occasion, it started to grow on me. Third time, I was hooked!I actually like it better than some of the past Styx that I have loved for years.It is refreshing to still have the old Styx style with a new sound. A definate recommendation for any Styx fan's library."
4,"Overall, a great CD!","While many critics have blasted this Styx effort, claiming that the band was just so torn apart at this point that they really made this a bad cd, I have to disagree. This is most definitely a return to form for Styx, and I feel that it satisfies both the fans of the hard rocking tunes (Heavy Water, Brave New World), and Dennis' soft rocking ballads (While There's Still Time, Goodbye Roseland). Styx rocks, and will keep on rockin' for many years to come."
2,"Let's face it, they're done...","I'm a big styx fan and profoundly enjoy many bands in the classic rock genre. But, let's face it, this new album just doesn't cut it. Like some of the other reviews have said, the band is old. While I agree, they used to make excellent music, they are simply past their prime at this point. I'm sorry, but I don't like any of the songs on this latest compilation. I give it a 2 out of 5."
1,The River STYX Leads to another crappy album,"While listening to wasted piece of plastic, I thought more good could come from producing latex condoms than what was put on this CD. Tommy Shaw tries way too hard to rock with his take on so many political issues no one cares about anymore. Quit bitching and moaning about society and write songs about what make rocks and roll exciting: sex and drugs.On another note, Gowen, Sucherman, and Burtnik should form their own identies and continue on without the likes of sappy DeYoung, predictable Shaw, and the aging J.Y."
1,A major disappointment,"I bought this album thinking that the lush rich cohesive sound that has been known as STYX would once again be prevalent in 1999. Unfortunately, this is hardly the case here. Unfocused mish-mash is the best way to categorize it. It definetly falls into two camps - Dennis DeYoung's 5 songs are the strength of the album with Fallen Angel, While There's Still Time, and Goodbye To Roseland sounding liek traditional STYX. Tommy Shaw and JY's songs could have been cut down by two thirds. What a bunch of filler junk! The STYX harmonies are almost non-existent and the sound is just God awful. My dog starts howling when he hears some of these songs. Witness, Just Fell In, What Have they Done for You, Number One, and Brave New World Reprise, and Heavy Water all should have been left on the cutting room floor. This album is STYX's equivalent of Dan Marino's last game (A 62-7 drubbing). What a disappointment."
2,Definietly not the Styx I grew to love with hits like 'Time On My Hands',"Not what I expected but it didnt surprise me. It's very laid-back, good harmonies, DeYoung is on it.Not a fan of the other members' singing at all on this one.I would only recommend this to the true die-hard Styx fans."
2,The fall of an empire,"This CD marks the end of the band Styx. Dennis DeYoung has always been the bands musical director, but on this (his last album with the band) the rest of the guys ignored him entirely and produced thier own material.The final result is a very mixed and (to be frank) lousy album.There are a couple of good tracks on it, but I'd only recommend it to collectors."
4,"Thank God, Styx is back!","I am a big time Styx fan. I have bootlegs from them and have their first release from Wooden Nickel records on an LP. This release definitely met my expectations. I play Everything is Cool over and over again. Side 2 is excellent from beginning to end. There are a couple duds on it though, especially While There's Still Time. Why does all of Dennis' songs have to be slow? Throughout Styx' career, I've always thought that they should decide whether they want to be rockers and a ballad driven band. Without Dennis on the road, Styx's rocks hard. Even these new songs sound good live. This release is much better than Edge of the Century. I'd be very excited if the current Styx lineup records something new."
3,A Sad Disappointment,"This album is anything but seamless. And small wonder because it was recorded in bits and pieces, with part of it recorded in Chicago, part in California, and part who-knows-where. I understand that under normal circumstances Dennis DeYoung would have edited to bring all parts together; but this was not to be! The only reason I give this 3 stars is in part due to Dennis' contributions (I loved High Crimes and Misdemeanors, While There's Still Time, and Goodbye to Roseland - I really can't say a whole lot for Fallen Angel and I have mixed feelings about Great Expectations). I'm glad I bought the CD since this is actually the LAST Styx performance. None of the original Styx group remains. John is dead, Chuck has retired and Dennis has gone on to other projects."
2,disappointment,"I am really disappointed by styx's latest cd Brave new world. I am a fan of the group and I own most of their albums. I was very excited when Return to Paradise was released. However, Brave New world was a fiasco. Let's hope the next one is much better. Javierjijena@yahoo.com (from Argentina)"
3,Better with each play...,"At first, i was disappointed, but the more I listened to it, the more I enjoyed. To me, it is obvious that the cohesiveness is not what it was, and it shows. I went back and listened to G.I., P of 8, and P.T., those were so awesome! I am all for trying different directions, but let's get the team back together as a band/unit!"
4,BRAVE NEW WORLD,"Styx is finally back! It's great to have James Young, Tommy Shaw and Dennis DeYoung making tunes again. Although I will have to admit the Tommy Shaw and James Young duo really rocks. Vocals are great and ""What have they done to you"" and ""Heavy Water"" are among the best. This is Styx into the new century. Another of my favorites is ""Brave New World"" and also ""Brave New World"" reprise. Hats off to the band for some great music to end the century. If you like good music without the ""pop"" sound, try it."
5,If You Like Storysongs....,"I like storysongs and Brave New World certainly fits the bill. And this album shows they've still got it! From the almost gospel-like Goodbye To Roseland to a sixties-style Just Fell In, they once again show their versatility and talent. Want an energy song to listen to on your way home from work? Best New Face, volume cranked, will definitely help you put your day behind you as you cruise home (or just simply cruise). While There's Still Time is a thought-provoking balad, especially for us boomers. Fallen Angel takes a look at all the ""heroes"" who truly aren't, showing them for what they truly are: people with problems just like the rest of us. Their voices still blend as well as they ever have, they can still write, they are still first-rate musicians. I've been a Styx fan for many years and this effort did not disappoint me at all."
3,I love styx..but this could have been much more.,I have enjoyed the music from the very first album. I'm glad they are back...but this could have been a much better effort. The band should have just been styx insted of trying to be all of the other pompus junk that is on the market today. Don't get me wrong...the cd will grow on me and I can't waite for the next cd in a couple of years. Styx I still love your music.
3,Average,"Everyone is giving either 1 or 5 stars. What happened to objectivity. I am a big Styx fan and this album is not nearly their best one ever, as some fans are saying. A lot of the songs are terrible. Some are average and a few are very good. Where is Dennis DeYoung? He has only 1 or 2 songs that I can even stand listening to on this album, and usually he is my favorite Styx member. JY, stick to guitar, you can't sing. A good effort, but could have been a lot better. I would love to see them start to consistently release albums. That way, each one will have 2 or 3 good songs and over a course of a few years, we will have an album's worth of good new Styx music. I am not sure if that is going to happen though."
5,Vocals-Vocals-Vocals,"After finally finding a copy of the new record (3 stores sold out of them where I live) I could not stop listening, What a joy to hear voices like this still exist in Rock and Roll. Who are there vocal teachers? How do they keep the voices sounding so good? Just amazing!Styx has always been one of the best sounding bands in concert, I mean god how many bands sound like the record in concert? I look forward to the Las Vegas show Sep-10th. Brave New Record. A must buy for Styx fans.And to whoever gave it those 1 stars (I didn't know Rolling Bone magazine was paying you to do this.)5 stars."
3,Brave New World,"This is a good but not great album. I am a long time fan of Styx, so I tend to be biased, but the album still has some weak points. The title track, as well as the first three, are solid. JY has his tracks also, so that keeps the album from becoming too pop. All in all, a good effort, not as good as Cyclorama, but better than Edge of the Century."
2,Please.....,"Lately, Diana Palmer's books have started to annoy me...the copyright in my book says 2004, but the dialect is from way before! Jordan was a jerk who in the last chapter manages to somehow become Prince Charming, Curt did nothing for Libby, and Libby acted like a helpless little girl when Jordan was around. She's a paralegal, for heavens sakes! Another thing, why do they say ""prophylactics""? when was the last time that word was used? It's a condom people. I'm also sick how in these books, the only reason they want to get married/fall in love is through sex. They don't really know each other, they just know they like kissing one another. I would not recommend this book; the conversation was so stilted."
2,Wrong copy sent,"As stated, it was the wrong font, wrong distributor and wrong publisher. I do not know if Amazon puts the books in categories or the seller does. But when a book is advertised as this one is from Kennebec Large Print Superior Collection and a Harlequin tiny print pocket book from another source is sent, it is very disappointing and confusing. I have been given a credit for the wrong book. I wish I could find the same book in Large Print and actually receive. Anyone have it?"
3,My thoughts on the book,"I enjoyed the authors style of writing. A little different from the books I usually read. The story is not a fast action type plot. Things move very slowly. But, it is filled with very descriptive narritve about whats going on at the moment.As an animal lover, it was a little hard to listen to how the dog was treated in the beginning of the book. The only thing that kept me listening was I knew it had to get better."
1,CANNOT BE PLAYED ON REGION 1 PLAYERS AS STATED,"The product details say Region 1 - US and Canada, but the DVD packaging says Region 2/3/4/5/6 and CANNOT be played on my US player. Please Amazon, can you get this product in a Region 1 version!!!"
1,NOT PLAYABLE ON REGION 1 PLAYERS,"This is a foreign produced DVD, It cannot be viewed on Region 1 DVD players. Bummer. Amazon, you should list this Information on the product."
2,oddly different,"this cd is completely different than their other, more famous, mtv shrewn music....i gave it two stars becuase it is comical...they remind me of dropkick murphys without ryan key singing...and no there is no violin"
1,horrible,this is a disgrace.. if you buy this album you should be shot... ocean avenue is an ill album... this is simply garbage
5,best yellowcard,"This Yellowcard CD is sooo much better than any of the others. I am not a big fan of the way their music has changed since its release. It progressively has gotten worse in my opinion (which is not one that appreciates their recent pop-punk style), but this CD is VERY good. It shows their high school rebellion stages (they went to Bolles in Jacksonville who wouldn't want to rebel from there). This CD shows their willingness to swear and speak about drugs, which is not present in their more recent CDs. They were lots better before they became mainstream, and this CD is an example of that. Many people won't like this CD because it is not the pop-punk that they hear on the radio or on MTV, but it shows the garage band punk that they originally wanted to play, which shows what genre they wanted to show themselves as. This is Yellowcard at its finest!"
5,Where We Stand,"I must say that this is a totally different sound than the current Yellowcard but it's for a good reason. This was when the band consisted of Ben Dobson on vocals, Todd Clary on vocals and guitar, Ben Harper on guitar, Sean Mackin(goes by Wellman on this album) on violin, LP Parsons III on drums, and Warren Cooke on bass. For many of you, 3 of those names are foreign. When Ben D. and Todd left the band, Ryan joined and that was the band until Warren left after making the Underdog EP. But back to the main purpose of this. This album is alot different from what you maybe be used to hearing from Yellowcard. The music is harder. It's not as upbeat as their albums once Ryan joined the band in 2000. But for it's category or being a hard rock kind of album, it's a great album. I'd recommend for you to get it. It is also a great album to have because it shows a measurement of how far they have came since 1998. They were amazing then, and even more amazing now."
4,FOR EVERYONE'S INFORMATION,"For everyone that LOVES yellowcard now b/c of Ocean Ave., and for everyone that CLAIMS to have been down for so long, then maybe you would know that this was not one for the 4 cds that they have, but one of the 6...this is a good cd, but by far the worst yellowcard cd. i love the cd, but it does not compare to 'midget tossing' or 'still standing' the 2 EPs that they had after this. then they got signed and came out w/ 'one for the kids' 'the underdog EP' and the of course the famed 'Ocean Ave.'. I have every single yellowcard cd, and this one is the worst, but still one of my fav. cds. i would recomend it to anyone."
4,Enjoyable read!,"Fun read. Infact, fascinating! Gives me renewed faith in humanity. No way to check his experiences as having been actual though.The Kindness of Strangers: Penniless Across America"
1,Mike McIntyre - The Kindness of Strangers,"I quit reading when the author assumed an overweight woman eating lunch in a park wouldn't give him any of her food. ""She was fat, she didn't get that way by counting calories"". Of course the author didn't know this woman or know whether or not she would actually share her lunch with him, he just assumed that all fat people are selfish pigs. Who needs that kind of negative stereotyping? I was so annoyed that I didn't just stop reading the book, I threw it in the trash can so no one else could read it either. I hope Mr. McIntyre never writes another thing again."
3,Interesting Travelogue,"Pretty interesting. He certainly has more courage than I have traveling the US like that. I was disappointed by the racism that he reports, unfortunate that we're still dealing with that."
2,Not so sure,Not so sure about this book. Haven't even finished it yet. Only got half way through when it got a bit annoying for me.
4,Absorbing read but an abrupt ending,"I enjoyed his human tour through the US, the tales of people he met and their trials and tribulations and how although many of them had difficult lives they were all giving in some ways.His personal stories were very engaging and sad in some cases, but the human spirit continually shone through the adversity and touched Mike and in some ways myself.I just felt the very sudden ending with little attention given to how he felt about his trip and what impact it had on him when home took a little away from the story, although I fully enjoyed the book overall."
4,More of a journey than a book.,"The value of McIntyre's story is in the people he meets along his ""penniless journey."" Although the writing is sometimes fragmented and jagged, the colorful souls he encounters across America paint a vivid image of the people of which our country is comprised. Sometimes, however, his manufactured poverty bordered on the absurd ... makes the reader wonder what McIntyre wouldn't do to create fodder for a book"
4,Good read,Very good read. Interesting look at American culture.Not sure he would have got very far in Namibia where I live but surprises come everyday.
5,I really liked this book,Was a very good book . It was interesting to learn about the different kind of people who stopped to help him. It was the kind of story I didn't want to end.
4,Interesting concept,"This book drew me in because it was advertised as a book about someone who left his job and went on a journey with few plans and no money. That always appeals to me - even though I'm the last person who would attempt this. I think McIntyre was trying to find something in a life that had not been as satisfying to him as he thought it could have been. As I read about the people who helped him along the way, I realized we are all ""odd"" in some way. I was imagining what McIntyre would write about my friends or about me if we'd picked him up. I think every American is unique and his book confirmed that for me. Some other reviewers thought McIntyre's ""helpers"" could not all possibly have so many issues. If you stop and think about where he was - on the road and truly penniless - I'm not sure what other kinds of people would be out there. Great read and I'm looking forward to reading his next book, the Wander Year."
4,Not your normal travel journal,"It's one thing to decide to hike a monumental trail, or walk across the country, but to hitchhike across the nation with absolutely no money is astonishing. Not only that, but to put your faith, and life, in the hands of complete strangers is nothing short of nerve racking. But that's exactly what the author did. Not only did he find the heart of what it's like to be an American, he also found that his life back home wasn't going down the path it was meant to go. Great first hand account of his journey, and I definately recommend it to anyone interested in this type of writing."
3,An ok read,"I liked The Wander Year so much I thought this would follow perfectly, but was disappointed. Maybe read them in the opposite order, but it's more like a serie of short meetings. I travel a lot and am used to these short and surprising moments with strangers, I felt nothing different than reading a newspaper, sort of hoping something would come up. Okay, not bad, not fulfilling."
3,interesting,feels like it was condensed and there must be a lot left out.what is written is interesting but it seems to leave a lot ofquestions unanswered.
5,An amazing story,Of someone trying to find himself and the kindness of America...I don't read many books and I could not put the book down....
4,Enjoyable,"I think this was a very enjoyable read. It can be kind of silly and maybe a little campy-sounding at times, but I think if you need a little pick me up, this is a good book for that."
4,an eye opener !,A book that makes you look at life very differently afterwards. Well written and enjoyable. I think there is a little bit of Mc Intyre in all of us.
4,Good read,I really enjoyed following Mike on his travels across the country. I think it was a very brave journey. He met a lot of wonderful people along the way and showed that there are still lots of good folks in the US.
4,Enjoyed,This was an easy book to read and very enjoyable. I will look for more books by Mike McIntyre. I know he's got one about a trip with his wife I'm thinking of downloading.
4,Great reading,I enjoyed this short book. I give the author credit for undertaking such an adventure. Glad he wrote about it.
4,An Interesting Story,A story about a hitch hiking trip from the west coast to the east coast. Many unusual people and events. An interesting and easy read.
2,So Sorry to Say...Boring,"I was intrigued by this book, but each chapter was less engaging than the one before. The descriptions of potentially interesting characters were one dimensional. I didn't even feel like I got to know the author any better through the story. This was a waste of my free prime book."
3,"Not Exciting, But Entertaining","McIntyre sets out from California to see if he can get all the way across the country without touching money, relying only on average Americans for shelter and food. It's interesting to note that this was not just a journey of self-discovery; the event was undertaken with the book in mind, which I felt detracted a bit from the actual experience.If this book can boast anything it is the clear and unadorned view of America from the road. There are no car chases, no big reveals, and no hidden agendas. McIntyre didn't dress it up with rhetoric, religious or political, he acted as the journalist that he is and reported what he saw; average people living their lives who took a few minutes or hours to help another person.Funny at times and heartbreaking at others, this was a well written and fascinating story."
5,Just Ducky Good Read,My six-year-old daughter laughed out loud at the antics in the barnyard. How silly... a duck on a bike! Each year my daughter buys books and donates them to the school library in honor of her teachers in lieu of an end of the year gift (how many apple paper weights can one teacher have?!?). This book was purchased for that reason but she enjoyed it so much she wanted to keep it for her personal library (this book is so good it needs to be shared is what convinced her to donate it). Enjoy!!!
5,Duck on a Bike~hysterical!,"This is a fun book, fun to read, fun to look at the great pictures and fun to listen to. A favorite of my grandsons, we laugh every time!"
5,Clever and Charming Artwork and Story,"The best artwork I've seen in a children's book, and I've read a lot of them. It's a cute and funny story, but the illustrations steal the show. Everyone should have this one in their library, and have a spare for a gift."
2,"Great story, terrible book quality","I purchased this storybook as a gift for my nephew after reading and loving the hardcover version with my own kids. This negative review is for the quality of this paperback edition. The paper and cover are extremely low quality--very flimsy. My copy arrived with a strange stain (almost like a coffee stain) inside the front cover, and the pages were all bent and wavy, as though the book was several years old and had been read quite a bit. I would definitely recommend this book for all children, but it's more than worth it to pay the few dollars extra for the hardback version."
5,Delightful!,"This is such a fun book for children and their Parents! The farm animals are so cute and the expression on their face is humorous! Parent's can have fun giving each character a different voice. This is an excellent book for young children! My son enjoys many of David Shannon's stories, including the David books. The David books are probably more for children past the toddler stage. My son read one of the David books in front of class and the students loved it! The David pictures are pretty funny too.Duck on a Bike is fun reading for the family!"
5,Just Ducky!,My four year old thinks it's hilarious to see Duck riding a bike and we both agree that the best page is at the end where the duck is pondering driving a tractor! We enjoy reading this together and he reads the animal parts while I narrate This is an enjoyable read aloud for kids and parents.
5,What E.R. Bird said - and a bit more,"My daughter had to hide this book from her 15-month old twin boys because they insisted on many repeat readings at each sitting. (Same with Brown Bear, Brown Bear--recently hidden, then brought out, and she had to read it to them 11 times. When they come to the end they start to whimper so Mom has to start again! lol!!!)The big wonderful illustrations of Duck really captivate the kids. I think we'll have to spring for a copy. We have them over every week."
5,Buying another copy,"We have the cheap softcover version, and it is so ""loved"" that we are now buying the hardcover for better durability. My three kids LOVE this book! Great story, great illustrations. Would make a perfect gift."
5,An Engaging Story for All Ages,"This happens to be my nephew's favorite book (and it's the third copy he's worn out). Duck on a Bike a delightful story about a dare-devil duck who sets off an bike riding adventure. On his journey around the farm, he greets other animas who in turn get jealous of his biking skills. In the end, all of the animals get a chance to join in on the fun!As an elementary school teacher, I highly recommend this book for children of all ages. The story is engaging and the illustrations capture the joy of the story!"
5,Effective arguments against dualism,"It is unlikely that those who gave this book poor reviews understood the book at all. In fact, this book is NOT an attack on Christianity, and furthermore, several contributors to this volume are prominent theological scholars. Contrary to others' opinions, the authors take a non-reductive physicalist approach to human consciousness, rather than a purely materialistic view. The contention of the authors is merely that human consciousness is a physical entity; not some undetectable, supernatural phenomenon. Critics subsequently concluded that this contention equalled a disbelief in God. I beg to differ."
5,No more Plato from the pulpit!,"People who have actually studied philosophy and are tired of hearing people rave on and on about saving ""souls"" can read this for direction and sound arguments. It is a good collection of experts in theological, scientific, and philosophical fields that are not trying to push materialism onto you and call it Christianity. These are seminary professors and Christian scholars who have done their homework and are trying to make the corrections necessary to share the faith in today's world. It accentuates religion's key characteristic of a new life in Christ. Makes a great partner to William James' ""Varieties of Religious Experience."" Theological Anthropology is much overlooked today, and Christians are taking flack. You do not have to believe in evolution, but you cannot deny modern neuroscience and psychology. This book delineates how that can be done."
5,Most Important Recent Book of Philosophical Theology,"This Collection of essays gathers several fine essays that give a monistic account of the soul. Rather than the standard dualistic account of the soul as something separate from the physical body, this collection emphasizes a more unified and wholistic conception of the self. Contributors are from a variety of academic disciplines which contributes to the book's strength. A provoking and important philosophical read for Christians and non Christians alike. A must read especially for psychologists of religion and/or for those interested in theology and science. An important book for scholars in all disciplines."
4,Worth reading,I liked this it had a good story line but the hole book seemed to be about joey. It is definatley worth reading if your a dawsons creek fan though. I would also definatley recomend major meltdown as i think thats the best in the series.
3,Harry Chapin Review II: Return of the Harry Chapin Review,"I can't imagine this being the case, but the vinyl sounds like a D.J. (for what I can only assume is greatest rap group ever) used spin this at shows. Violently. The deal was great, double album that contains one of my favorite songs on its original format for two bucks, but it skips like Pipi Longstocking (she skips, right?). Not bad though, I can""t remember if they mentioned anything about it, but the skips were off-putting."
2,"I've heard worse, but alot better",This albulm proves you can't believe everything you read. I read rave reviews obviously paid off by his manager. This is not a Terrible albulm but does new justice to the term mediocre.I will take it with me on my next trip to the used CD store.
5,CONVERSE RULES!!,"I got Vince Converse's Cd back in february and I have been listening to in non stop! I saw him live in September and he plays with Jimi Hendrix's spirit. This album's blend of blues. rock and funk and his unique guitar playing rules! He is not some Stevie Ray Vaughan knock off. He is great, i cant wait to hear more from him."
3,Excellent,"I first heard Vince at the Sturgis Rally 99 at the Pyramid Beer Garden. I must say that I have never heard anyone better at the craft of playing a wide variety of music, rock/blues. But on this album he pulls a ""Clapton"" on us. You can buy a CD of either of these performers but to actually see the talent of these guys you have to see them perform live. Vince blew my mind as to how great this young performer is and I wish that more of his guitar work was evident on the CD that I bought at the Pyramid. This guy has more talent than you can believe when he is live and I hope that future CD's will will allow us to hear more of the genius that is in his hands (guitar)."
5,Great,"Fantastic service, I received it very quickly and exactly what I was looking for and it was cheaper than anywhere else that I looked"
5,Great new Series,"I love this new series. i just caught the season premeire of the second season. It was hilarious. This show kind of reminds me of entourage. The only problem i had watching it were the commercial, waaaaaay to many! I fully recoment spending a few buck for commercial free episodes! Hope they post more on Amazon Instant Video!!!"
1,terrible,"Over all, the the series is good. But, they really dropped the ball on this episode. The writing was awful. If I could give it a negative star, I would."
1,Stuffing the ballot box indeed,I'm pleased someone else has picked up on the fact that nearly all the positive reviews have been written by the same person.As this perceptive reviewer noted all these reviews quote and repeat the same 3rd party accolades and praise (while bashing other reviewers who have been less complimentary).More obviously though the writing style is identical and the reviews read like poorly disguised advertisements.It would appear that the not-so closet capitalist Elixxir and his minions are busy protecting his commercial interests...He comes across on his website as an agressive and somewhat unsophisticated businessman preying on the human desire for longeivity. Don't waste your precious time or money on this book.
1,The ImmorTalist Manifesto,"I have never read such derivative, kitchy, self-serving, cash-cow milking drivel in my entire life. This author needs to start his quest for immortality by seeking to grow up.A representative quote:""My childhood friends have all grown old, fat, and ugly.I now look more like their son than their classmate or peer. I am still getting carded by bouncers at bars and clubs. I will outlive my enemies - and marry their children."""
1,Closing in on imortality to the possible extent;,"1/Love and be loved. 2/ Get as much education as you can.3/ Find a job that you like. 4/Exercise , averaging one hour of some sort of physical activity each day, including warm-ups, cardio and strength work, cool-downs, and stretching. 5/Eat fresh, whole, ripe, raw, organic fruits and vegetables, and drink the cleanest water available, distilled being the best.6/Floss. 7/ Avoid x-rays, and drugs of all kinds. 8/ Wear a seat-belt. 8/Get some early or late sun. 9/ Keep a lot of plants in your home.10/Don't smoke.11/Be born into a family without any genetic predispositions for disease. ...that is all for now..."
1,He must be kidding!,The book would only be a few pages long except that the author continually repeats himself. He claims to be fifty years old but will not reveal his true name so his age is impossible to verify. While the book makes some good points it is an advertisement for his website.
5,Brilliant! Provocative! Trenchant!,"If you read just one book in this new year, or in the next ten, let The Immortalist Manifesto be the one. It just might save your life! Having read too many lightweight books claiming to be It, I believe this is IT - The Big Book we've been waiting for. It can - and this is no exaggeration - literally change the world as we know it.The Vatican and The Religious Right - ""Mortalist"" Religion - will hate this book! It could put them out of business.Be forewarned. This is not a polite book. It is in your face, and its arguments take no prisoners. It gives a new paradigm for our ""Post-Mortalist Era."" Unlike other books which only criticizes ""Extreme Market Capitalism"" or ""Globalization,"" this book offers an exciting alternative vision.Written in deliberately plain, minimalist English, its analytical and polemical power packs a revolutionary punch."
1,Grow up & Save Yourself,"The idealist society the author portrays can only be found in ""paradise"". It seems that he does not realize that our ultimate goal is to transcend societal and personal hardships by maturing and enduring, acquiring as much knowledge as we can, and then shedding gour earthly shells. He most definitely will not realize his ""utopia"" until he moves to the next level of consciousness."
1,nonsense,"Just do a Google search and look at Elixxir's website. The contents therein should be enough to convince you how ridiculous this book is as well. Anyone who will rent you his ""presence"" for an evening for $1,500 (or how about a year for $1,000,000!!!) is a charlatan of the highest order. Gee, you mean I can ask Elixxir anything I want and watch him eat for only $1,500?! Give me a break.This is the only item I've reviewed on Amazon that truly deserves 0 stars. Unfortunately that isn't an option."
4,Moondust and Madness,"I was looking over all the reviews and was amazed at what they said. Although the book was extremely R rated at times the rest of book was great. It was both, exciting and well written."
5,It's the best romance novel ever written!,This was one of the first romance novels I ever read and let's just say it got me hooked! It has a wonderful plot and the characters are great.
1,Just Madness,"There's a reason this thing is out of print. The characters are shallow caricatures of stereotypes. The writing is poor and the plot predictable. There is a romance, and there is lust, which is really what the book is about. It's just done so badly that it becomes more amusing then anything else. But what truly offended me about this book was it's science fiction designation. Space ships, zap guns and humans in alien suits don't make a story SF."
1,"A hideous book, but....","If you are looking for a trashy porn novel with sex scenes that read like a play-by-play from a game of twister with tripple-jointed aliens, this could well be the book for you. The author seems to have moral sensibilities not too unlike those of John Norman of ""Gor"" series fame, as evidenced by the following quote: ""He shuddered to think he might never have discovered or experienced this if Jana hadn't entered his life, if they hadn't yielded to the chemistry between them, if he hadn't purchased her at the auction."" While an abysmal book, Moondust and Madness makes a great party game: Open up to a random page and start reading until you crack up. I think the record was half a page, when we played this game in college."
5,Great Read!,Loved the whole series. Have read the four books at least 6 times. I am sure that I will read them many more.
1,Dangerous Video. Beware.,"Long, tedious and cumberson to use. Information should be more concisely presented. Do these women really understand dogs? The section on how to deal with working on a difficult dog is dangerous information to put in novices' hands especially when the ""expert"" looked as though she could have been bitten by the dog. Viewer caution advised."
5,Amazing!,"This is the first I've ever heard of Marc Antoine, and I'm an instant fan! His music is so beautiful! He just has a way with that guitar! I reccomend this to any jazz fan! It's a great change from the sax!"
3,"Universal Language, ecletic Antoine.","Universal Language doesn't have the ""grab"" of the first two albums, Classical Soul and Urban Gypsy. ""Palm Strings"" worth the price of the CD. It is a magnificent arrangement, and it will make you move on first listen. ""Elikya"", ""Bossa Nova"" and ""Celta"" really good."
3,Eclectic Acoustic Guitar,"Marc does a fine job on this album. I like the first 4 tracks a lot, but it pretty much stops there. The backside of this album pushes the limits of techno and new age, but there's a splash of jazz to it. I would most likely say that this album requires an acquired taste, you'll either love it or hate it, there's really no in between. I love it, but I can see how others might regard it as something that is a little overdone. I suggest listening to some cuts before you pick it up."
4,SKIRT,Sire Records has caught a keeper with Skirt! The song Couting can only be a hint of what is to come from this talented band in the future.
3,It's worth buying just for the Lifeboy song...,"This soundtrack is a mediocre collection of little-known bands, peppered with some names you might know (ie Elton John, Joan Jett). The album is saved, though, by the 2nd track, Lifeboy's ""Number One,"" an infectious, head-bobbing rock tune. This song has ""hit"" written all over it, and deservedly so. Kudos to Lifeboy for keeping this otherwise lame soundtrack afloat."
