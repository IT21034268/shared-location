4,"Very comprehensive, but not for the faint of heart","If you are a DIYer like me, this book is invaluable. From the electrical system all the way down to individual clips, it contains all the information you would need to disassemble and reassemble any component(s).That being said, it is not the most user friendly manual. If you have little to no experience working on cars, the language used in this book can be quite intimidating and vague. However, if you have the patience, you will find this manual to be a worthwhile investment. A virtual necessity for anybody who wants to care for their Mark IV VW on their own.If you're just starting out, look at VW Vortex for some great DIY threads. If you're experienced (and got the funds), get this manual!"
5,IMPOSSIBLE TO PUT DOWN!,"Have you ever wondered what it would be like to have an exact double? Meet Laura, just your average, everyday teen. But behind that average, everyday life is secret that no one wanted Laura to uncover.Laura has a twin. An exact double. But the similarities are only skin deep. Laura's twin is evil, and Laura's twin wants revenge.Can Laura save herself and those she loves? Or will evil prevail?There's only one way to find out. READ THIS BOOK! It will not disappoint!"
3,PRETTY CREEPY,"This book make you think a lot. I found it to be a very creepy story, maybe that's because I have a twin and that's just werid for me. But, its one of those books where you use logic to figure it out by the end. Yet, I must say the logic in this book is most peciular."
2,Recommend it for younger readers.,"My teenage daughters read this and one other book by Lois Duncan, and they liked the story but said it was too short of a book and not written well."
1,"""Stranger With My Face""",I thought this book was a bit confusing and a little weird. It freaked me out a little and I would only read it if you are a middle school student because there are some parts that were a little disturbing.
1,Lois Duncun has Done it again?,"I have liked most of Lois Duncun's books. I picked this one up because it said, ""author of Summer of Fear"" and that is my favorite book. When I read this I didn't pick up the words. They passed through one ear and out the other. The book looked good at first but it got dull and I couldn't finish it. This book is a good mystery/horror but I couln't pick up on any of the charachters at all. I could barley remember the names of the people. Maybe it's just me but I really didn't like the book"
5,"Great story, keep up the good work Lois Duncan!",This was the first Lois Duncan book I read and I loved it. I really felt like I was the main character in the story. I'm glad my sister bought me the book or it probably would have been a long time before I knew about Lois Duncan. Lois Duncan is now one of my favorite authors. Thanks for writing Lois.
5,what a book,"This was a great book . I just couldn't put it down. I love how Lois Duncan keeps the suspense going. I would recomend this book for any one, great for summer reading. I think that this will be one of the best books I will read all summer. If you want a book that keeps you, wanting to read this is the one."
3,by a kid,I would recamen this book to any one who likes to read. I would give this book 10 out of 10. I felt like I relate to this book.
1,Horrible!,"It kills me to say that I hate this book with a passion! It was simply horrid, so horrid I only got halfway through it! This is the only book of Lois Duncan's I haven't liked so far! If you wish to be disgusted, then read it!"
4,Good one,This book is an excellent book to read in a short period of time. It's not too long to bore you and you can read it pretty quickly. If your not into fairy tale type books then this is a book for you. i enjoyed reading this book andi most definately reccomend it to almost anyone.
3,An interesting novel,"Stranger With My Face is about a girl who's life gets really confusing when she keeps seeing a girl with her face. She finds out she was adopted and she has a twin in New Mexico. It gets confusing and gratuitous, the best thing about this book is the character of Jeff."
3,Slow until the end,Okay I have to say all in all this book was slow and boring until the last three chapters where you're left wanting to know what will happen.I personally think Lois Duncan has done better and can do better.Her writing of this was just not on track at all. It made me feel like I was watching a bad film.In the book Laurie finds out she has a twin named Lia. Lia starts showing up on the island where Laurie lives and people think they are seeing Laurie. Now Laurie must fid out why her twin is showing up and how she is showing up.I have to say my favorite character had to be Helen because she was very practical with what she did and said and was the only one who really made any sense.Penny Lane
3,Get a regular spray nozzle instead,"My three year old daughter just had ""water day"" at school, and she claimed this was her favorite toy...although that might have been because it allowed the children to squirt water at the teachers. Although my daughter loved this item, I found that the nozzle leaked at the point where it was joined to the hose. I suspect that a regular spray attachment on the hose would be as much or more fun for children and would doubtlessly be far more durable."
1,Attachment leaks so much we can't use it.,"I ordered this for my 3 year old daughter to entertain her in the summer. It was recommended in a popular kids magazine. As soon as it arrived we were so excited to outside to use it. We cannot get the attachment to connect properly so it leaks so badly we cannot use it. It was a great idea since my daughter loves to use the hose, but it didn't work."
2,Not worth it,"Don't spend the extra money for this translation. Buy the Dover Thrift edition. You get the same story for a buck or two, and this translation is nothing spectacular."
1,Warning: defective gem!,"All of the above is true: this CD has a beautiful piano sound and provides informative notes. The execution is also flawless, with its pianist, Evgeny Soifertis, making each little gem into a diamond. However, I must also warn any possible buyer that my CD came out defective; every other track had horrible scratching sounds the source of which could only be found in the recording process. It hurts me to have to say this of Meridian, a recording label that has traditionally specialized in recording relatively unknown works and/or artists at the beginning of their careers... but, I find it very unsettling that a label could put out a product like this. Any superficial inspection, no matter how quick, should have caught this blaring defect and prevented the item from reaching the public. I will not take a risk buying a replacement copy from the same label - Times are hard."
1,Defective pressing ruins CD,"Having purchased a recording from this CD on iTunes, I was excited to finally buy the whole album. Soifertis does a wonderful job bringing to life these charming pieces. However, I wish I had done my research and heeded the warning of Lares's previous review: I was aghast to find that the last dozen or so tracks are marred by a horrible, intermittent scratching noise which renders them unlistenable. I am returning this today for a refund. Shame on you Meridian!"
1,Nicole Kidman... a robot???,"Ira Levin's famous suburban Gothic THE STEPFORD WIVES already has so much black comic potential built into its premise that making this remake of the much loved 1975 film into an all-out comedy was a mistake from the get-go. So was assembling the creative team and the cast: director Frank Oz and screenwriter Paul Rudnick are hardly known for the light touch this approach would have required, and nor are Bette Midler and Jon Lovitz (in important supporting roles). Glenn Close and Christopher Walken also seem oddly chosen for a comedy, but the worst miscasting is Nicole Kidman as the heroine, Joanna Eberhart. With her wafer-thin arms and torso and flawless, highly polished skin, she hardly makes the ideal choice to be the mouthpiece for accepting human imperfection."
4,Better than I expected,"I thought this movie was going to bomb, but it turned out better than I expected and was actually pretty funny. I liked it. I'm glad it was remade into a comedy because had it been remade as a thriller than it would have been a cheap knock off re-make of the original not worth watching.I'd recommend it. Light humor, cliche ideas highlighted in a humorus light."
3,"Holes and all, it's still fun","Yes, yes... I know there are plot holes and the continuity was destroyed by a tacked-on ending, but this was still an enjoyable film.Glenn Close is FABULOUS and it's great to see Bette still at the top of her game. I got many great laughs from the script.Personally, I didn't miss the feminist undertones of the original. Here if there is any message I think it is that we are all guilty, women and men, for treating each other as objects and devaluing our relationships with each other.Not a great film, but I've seen much worse."
1,P-U!,"What a waste of my money! This movie made no sense and ended very, very badly.It had such potential...actors, scenery - then, nothing.I LOVE the original Stepford Wives. This one is quite awful.My recommendation? Don't buy this film. Spend your money on groceries or something of use."
1,The women are not really Robots ? Huh ?,"This movie has a major logic flaw. The audience is lead to believe that the wives are mechanical robots. But at the end of the movie, it is revealed that they are really human women who have been brainwashed. That is totally stupid!!! How would you explain the scene where one wife has her neck broken, but the next day she is still alive. In another scene, another wife has the ability to withstand burning fire. The only reason people rent this movie, is to find out if all the women were murdered, or at least placed in a frozen ice cube stasis chamber. That would give the movie the element of Horror and Suspense. I was watching the movie eagerly waiting to find out that horrific ending. But the ending outcome that the director gives is totally unforgivable. I feel as if I wasted my time watching this movie."
5,November 9,I cant wait to get this DVD... IM GONNA EXPLODE! The Stepford Wives is one of the BEST films of the year. of course i loved Van Helsing too so dont listen to me.
2,The first question is: why?,"The second is: did they screen this all the way through before its release. There is such an ENORMOUS gaffe in this that even if you liked the film, it's gonna real bug you after it's over. Otherwise, Rudnick has come up with a few hillarious moments that make it worth a view. His take on the womens club vs the original is quite funny. Nicole Kidman as a TV exec almost lampooning Faye Dunaway in Network is a hoot. Most other scenes don't fare as well. Midler is all wrong here - too brash, too loud, too one-note. Definitely misses the subtlety of Paula Prentiss in the original. Glenn Close steals every scene she is in for the comedy bits of the film and with a cast like this - that's some job. If only the majority of the script didn't let them all down. Recommended as a companion piece or for comparison to the original only."
2,I'm Stuck between 2 & 3 Stars,"Three stars is too generous because that would imply this was a good movie and two stars would mean it wasn't good. It was OK.The performances were very good, especially Glen Close and Nicole Kidman, but the story was some what confusing. Robots or chips? Which one was it? I don't think the director knew either. It wouldn't be fair to compare the 1970's version because they are somewhat different. A clone would be pointless and the twists in the new version are welcomed.This movie is more of a rental not a purchase. Not a must see."
5,I think it's great movie,"Am i alone in thinking it's cool movie? Maybe not whole 5 stars, but still very nice, hilarious and relaxing. Very nice actors: Nicole Kidman and Bette Midler makes this movie very funny.But really they could have done a much deeper version of this film and it would have been fantastic. Matthew Broderick wasn't a convincing husband for Nicole Kidman - he doesn't look any older than when he was in Ferris Bueller's Day Off! Funny twist at the end, glad we watched it, Bette Midler was funny as ever.We enjoyed having a night in watching a fun film."
4,'Wives' Has Smart-Aleck Edge,"One of this films key success is the casting. Who better than Nicole Kidman to represent the ideal woman? Glenn Close to be the perfect housewife? But then throw in Bette Midler...as a Stepford Wife and you got the mix for great comedy. Even the male cast is good. Chris Walken, usually a bad guy, is funny as the leader of this small town. The gay couple, with one turning republican, is a nice modern touch. This film is genuinely funny and leaves the original one alone. This is not a suspense movie, but a biting satire of modern values and morals. A top notch, witty screenplay and top flight direction make this redux stand out by itself."
4,Eerie and Hysterical all in the same hand basket!!,"When I saw the previews for Stepford Wives, I expected it to be more of a straight forward story line according to the novel. The novel was much more garish at the end. However, the movie threw me off guard and had me laughing unbelievably hard!! If you're looking for a kick me in the shins comedy..you just have to see Stepford Wives.. not so much a suspense as it is a new age reason to smile and enjoy life!!"
5,STEPFORD WIVES,I LOVED THIS MOVIE. IT WAS HILARIOUS. A GREAT MOVIE TO WATCH OVER AND OVER. PEOPLE WHO LOVE A SINCE OF HUMOR WILL CERTANTLY LOVE THIS. WHEN A FAMILY MOVIES INTOA NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE EVERYTHING IS PERFECT AND THE LADIES ACT STRANGELY THEY BEGIN TO WONDER IF THIS PLACE IS TO PERFECT OR DOES IT HAVE A FLAW..........CAN THE WIVES OF STEPFORD REALLY BE ROBOTS?
1,One of worst movies ever made,"It is not giving way the ending of this movie to say that the writer seems to have forgeting the plot of movie half way through and started writing a differant one. Personally I can not blame him. Throw in some un funny anti and anti sementic jokes, (note I am the most un pc person in world so if I am put off it says somthing) and an apperance by larry king, and and you have everything wrong with american movie making.Please note- Jon Lovitts character in the critic word have great time with this high budget turkey"
1,Worst movie yet!,"I bought this DVD and what a waste of money. It is the worst movie I've seen. I can't believe one of my favorite actresses,Glenn Close wasted her time starring in this."
2,A Fantasy Island,"Stepford is a mythical place in Connecticut where fantasy's come true. However, they end there, too.This film might be worth three dollars. Maybe."
1,Stepford Wives Comedy Theatre,"If you have seen the original version if this movie, don't waste your time on the remake. It is absolutuely awful. If you have not seen the original, rent it and be prepared to see a quality movie instead of a piece of utter waste that is politically correct, obnoxious and embarassing. Fine actors were wasted in this remake of a classic. The story line was altered beyond recognition and instead of a suspenseful drama that scared one, we got a mixture of poor taste, half-hearted attempts at comedy and political statements at every turn. Hopefully it will die an early death at the theatre. Barely a half star is earned on this mess!"
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A dead-in-the-water black comedy/thriller, The Stepford Wives feels long even at 93 minutes, offers little more than a few chuckles, and never really makes a whole lot of sense."
2,Weird......,"Not exactly sure what the movie's point is, except that robotic women are a nightmare. Very different, and I must say that any director that wanted to do a movie like this, doesn't have enough in his life to do."
2,Was this really necessary?,"The original was a very effective, cautionary horror tale. The remake can't seem to make up its mind what it wants to be -- it definitely isn't scary -- and it doesn't include what I thought to be one of the more important bits from the original, the exchange between Katherine Ross' character and the psychiatrist before she gets taken back home and roboticized. I will say the revised ending does add some important food for thought."
2,"GreatActing,GreatDirecting,BeutifullScenery,butWHY?","""The Stepford Wives"" had some of the greatest acting,with all of my favorite stars in one movie.The Scenery was Beutifull,and the film kept you interesting,but WHY MAKE THIS MOVIE?We know what its all about.So there's a different twist at the end,but I wish I would have gotten another DVD last weekend to watch."
2,Rule number one concerning remakes......,"Do not, do not, I repeat, do not CHANGE THE ORIGINAL ENDING!!!The finale of this movie was not good. Glenn CLose was excellent in this picture as was Cristopher Walkin, but the ending was so stupid. You saw it coming though Matthew Broderick has to play a wimp in every movie he's in so you almost knew that he was gonna pull a fast one.In the original the women are disposed of and replaced with robots. In this movie the women simply have computer chips implanted into their brains. I can go along with that for a change, fair enough. But to have a robot running everything with Glenn behind the scenes? No, no, no.ALthough I will admit I did sort of enjoy Bette Midler in this. I can't normally stand her, but my wife is a fan of hers. Bette's character name in this was 'Bobbi' which is my wife's name. I found that ever so amusing."
1,The Stepford Wives,"With all these big names attached to this movie, you can't go wrong, right? WRONG! ""The Stepford Wives"" is the biggest disappointment of the year (so far). The horrific story of men replacing their wives with robots that are perfect little wives has been turned into a comedy that lessens the impact of the story. The brains behind this remake have also changed the ending, essentially putting the blame back on the women! And most irritatingly of all, the wives seem to go back and forth between robots or just being the real wives with microchips in their heads that allows them to be controlled. This movie seems to be slapped together just to be able to get a few laughs out of the situation, with no regard for the audience's intelligence. All the talent in this movie is wasted. Save your money and stay away from this stinker."
2,What were they thinking?,"I couldn't wait to see The Stepford Wives when it was released on DVD, so I rented it and boy I wish I could have gotten some warning before I watched this slow, unfunny, pointless movie. Matthew Broderick really annoys me, the only movie he can act in is Ferris Bueller's Day Off, all his other films that he has acted in are hideous and crummy, give this guy some acting lessons. I love Nicole Kidman but lately she has picked some lousy choices (The Interperter, Dogville, Bewitched), what the heck is her problem, rent The Others and The Human Stain instead. They should've just stuck to the regular premise of the original film, a comedy version was all wrong. Even the ending made me furious, just skip this and rent something else, it's a silly little movie."
1,One Word - Awful,"This is the worst movie I've seen in years. I thought for sure it would be a decent movie with the cast of actors starring in this film. Save your money, it is AWFUL!"
2,"More of a chick flick, then having any actual meaning","It's got some funny lines, made me laugh out loud a few times, but despite the supposed meaning of the movie, (women not being objects and such) it didn't speak to me at all. I was expecting at least some sort of outspokeness for women all around, but I was again disappointed. I am also a bit confused by the fact that much of the preview lines, I didn't see in the movie. I found that just a tad strange. Nicole Kidman gave an excellent performance as always, but Anthony Hopkins playing a not so convincing big shot wasn;t the right part for him. So if your looking for a bit of a corny movie to chill with your friends in, this is it. But don't expect Oscars for this movie."
5,The Stepford Wives Comedy,"Just say this movie today. THe original from 1975 was a favorite of my mother, and I vaguely remember seeing it. This updated version with Nicole Kidman, Bette Midler, Faith Hill and Christopher Walken was hilarious. It did have some suspense that was shortlived, but was so funny! Bette Midler left the audience howling with laughter, and Nicole Kidman is brilliant as Joanna the lead. Christopher Walken is as always, very good, and Faith Hill didn't have enough of a roll to judge. I think most women would love to see the reality of Bette Midlers character Bobbie, who is a writer that could care less about the clutter in her house. A perfect house is lovely, but reality is that it gets messed up with use. Great movie!"
1,Another pointless attack on 1950's womanhood.,This remake (of the far superior B movie)joins the ranks of Mona Lisa Smile and Pleasantville (though both of those films were done better)as an attack on 1950's values. Perhaps it is an easy and defenseless target but it is no excuse to hold up reality TV and drug and gang culture as progress. I missed the fifties but how can you hold up the breakdown of marriage and family as superior to the ideals once held by this country a half century ago. What we have now is the cowardly cackling of ancient Roman excess. This flick is shockingly bad in every aspect.
2,"Rent the original. pass on this one, DOLLAR SHOW","Just went to see this yesterday early afternoon.... my girls and I give it aC-Would NOT see it again, but it was funny.... loved Bette and Christopher...The original Stepford Wives you cannot compare it is a dark movie..this had HUMOUR..."
4,Nobdy is Perfect...,Wow from reading the reviews you would think I had a totally different movie. I absolutely loved this movie. I loved the humor and the fact that it poked fun at our way of life...was humorous! I think this movie was also well cast from Walken to Midler .JoAnna (Kidman) loses her job and has a nervous breakdown prompting her family to movie to Stepford. When they get there everything is PERFECT too perfect. And JoAnna is out of place. Walter tends to fit in with the guys because he wants to. JoAnna finds Bobbie (Midler) and Rodger (Bart) and they team up to try and find out why everything is so perfect. When soon Bobbie and Rodger also become PERFECT. Soon JoAnna will find her fate. You will be surprised to her the actual person behind Stepford is not who you think it is. And along the way there is lots of laughs as long as you don't take this movie to seriously I find it to be a good movie!
4,Ridiculous but hilarious.,"This is movie has many flaws BUT, dont let that stop you from owning it. The performances by the big stars are so over the top funny--particularly Glenn Close, whose talent never ceases to amaze me--everyone looks like they had real fun making this picture. The plot basically falls apart toward the end and the philosophical agenda of Ira Levin is watered down to nothing, but who cares? It's just worth it for the laughs. I haven't laughed this much out loud at such comic-acting excess in a really long time and it was fun to feel that with Stepford Wives. This is one of those no-brainers to watch over and over again--alone or with friends."
2,Wasted Kidman.,"Shame on the producers of this film. The plot was flimsy, the comedy was flat, there was almost no character development and no time for any, and worst of all ... who cast this movie?!?! I love Matthew Broderick, but he was not right opposite Nicole Kidman at all. There was a glaring lack of chemistry between them, though no one's fault. Kidman did an excellent job of portraying her love for him, but the two stars had no sparks. This movie, remade as comedy, needed either a) romance, or b) more plot, and it had neither.I am worried that the remaking of Bewitched with Kidman will carry the same burden... lack of chemistry between her and Will Farrell. Please moviemaking people, give Nicole Kidman more suitable costars. You can't pair up a Princess with a Pugsley and expect America to love it."
2,Bright and disappointing,"How can a movie with such great actors and production value fall flat on its face? Who knows. Even Nicole Kidman couldn't save this film. The only person that rises to the occasion is the dynamic and psychotically cheerful Glenn Close.While trying to bridge the genres of comedy, social commetary, and horror-thriller, the film ends up blandly in the middle. Don't check this film out."
2,Such an awkward movie,"The Stepford Wives is a huge disappointment of a movie. At best one could think of it as a series of smart one liners strung together with very little drama and a lot of poor writing. The actors in this movie clearly have no idea where they are going with their characters. They often look perplexed and let hang awkward silences that are reminiscent of plays from my middle school days. Some actors are trying to play for laughs while others are playing for realism and the combination is aggravating. The story is similarly divided. It is never truly scary and its laughs never make up for its glaring plot holes and shoddy editing.See this movie only with the purpose of making fun of it. Enjoy the smart zingers thrown in every five minutes or so, but don't expect this movie's storyline to be grounded in any reality."
3,A bit disappointing.,"I was very excited when I learned that Nicole Kidman was starring in a remake of ""The Stepford Wives,"" but the movie disappointed me. The story was modernized a bit, and I thought all that was fine. What irked me is the way they ended the film on such a happy note. I've you're read the book, you know that's not the way it's supposed to happen at all. I think it would have been a much better movie if it wasn't trying (unsuccessfully) to be funny and have a much lighter ending than the book.The best thing about the movie is Glenn Close, who is hysterical. I didn't like the way the movie ended, but it was an interesting concept to have Close be the mastermind of the whole thing.People who haven't read the book version might enjoy this film more than the rest of us. I hope that they make a movie one day that is true to the vision of the book."
1,a Step Down,"The original Stepford Wives was a suspense, filled with a ""Big Brother"" feel of erie similarity; a comment on suburbia and modern values. This is a poorly made re-make, played for laughs. It has no moral center. In fact, it's so over-the-top, it is as if the producers of this trash just hired the stars to go through the motions, no acting requried, and the expression of the main characters is about at the same level as the robotic wives. Who cares who's replaced? I am still waiting for Hollywood to stop re-making films that were decent to begin with --or has everyone forgotten how poorly made imitations of Charade and Sabrina were?"
1,"""CLUNKER""","If you liked the the original 1975 version starring Katherine Ross, you will probably have the same opinion I have about this new version starring Nicole Kidman. It's the WORST ever! It reminded me of a parody sketch (gone wrong) with Carol Burnett and Harvey Korman.Three great talents, Nicole Kidman, Christopher Walken and Bette Midler all wasted!"
3,Bad storyline,"It is true that this movie makes no sense: First the women show a behaviour thats only possible if they are robots, then at the end it reveals they are normal woman but only with a chip implanted in their head. Thats one thing, but what really destroys the movie is that soon after the first looks at the women, right in the beginning in Stepford, it is already clear they are some kind of robot. It is no surprise anymore, the secret is really not a secret and Joana and her friends do not see the obvious until the end, its so unbelieveable."
2,Misguided,"Did you ever see a movie based on a book you really liked only to be disappointed by the lack of depth and how the movie seems to ""breeze"" thru the really juicy parts? Well, somehow, this movie achieved the same effect by being based on another movie! It's an interesting decision to make a comedy out of a 70's sci-fi\horror flick, and for that i give kudos - but, the result is a movie that has no idea if or how it should be funny OR tense, and thus achieves neither. I actually thought Kidman did a good job with what she had to work with, but Midler and Broderick are weak, and Close is downright awful in her ""big"" scene. Unless you're a die-hard Kidman fan, I don't think you should bother with this one, it leaves you empty and wondering what the whole big idea was."
2,Slap Shtick: Plug in and cook until well over done,"THE STEPFORD WIVES is a funky outing that takes to task the dumbing down of the wealthy class. While everyone knows the plot of the original book and 1975 movie, few will recognize the parody that Frank Oz has created. Everything is over-the-top, including performances by such actors as Nicole Kidman, Glenn Close, Matthew Broderick, Jon Lovitz, Roger Bart and Christopher Walken - each of whom seems to be out to do parodies of their usual 'roles'. But if you like movies like Practical Magic and Rat Race and Cheaper by the Dozen, then this expensive bit of fluff may please. Just don't expect insights into feminism, male dominance psyche, or the (now obligatory) inclusion of gays into the township of perfection called Stepford. Entertaining for what it is. Grady Harp, November 2004"
3,"Funny, but a misfire.","THE STEPFORD WIVES, as it was written, was supposed to be scary, but, in this version reimagined by director Frank Oz and screenwriter Paul Rudnick, it's a farce.It's not a particularly successful farce, though it is occasionally funny. Nicole Kidman stars as a castrating, domineering harpy who's neglecting her family. Matthew Broderick is there but doesn't make much of an impression. Bette Midler's somewhat funny.But co-star Roger Bart, playing a gay ""Stepford Wife,"" and the magnificent Glenn Close pretty much steal the movie."
2,unexpectedly disappointed,"What can I say to sum this all up...1) Great choice in cast...especially Christopher Walken, but then again he has a charisma that is both spooky and inspiring in every movie2) Not much of a stretch for the talent of this cast to play their parts3) Humor was ok, nothing that made me laugh out loud4) Anti-climatic story if there ever was one5) An ok plot twist at the end6) The late 80's and 90's had comedy sidekicks as the Black man with a smart mouth. This movie is another attempt to change that previous setup to the current trend of the Gay man who is witty and funny as he balks the heterosexual world around him. It just didn't do it for me...not funny in this attempt.Overall my wife and I both felt like we wasted our time with a sub-standard made movie. Not even worth the rental!"
1,They Ruined It!,This was very disappointing - especially if you saw the original Katherine Ross version and/or read the book.I have never anticipated the arrival of a movie so eagerly only have the actual movie be so lackluster. There was no follow up from one concept to the next. The film was poorly edited and lacked continuity. Don't waste your time!
1,boo,this was supposed to be funny. isn't false advertsing illeagal. well it should be. i hated this movie. i can't explain all the ways it sucked but i'll name a few.1. no comedy2. not even plausible3. it's not the thinking peeps movie4. no nudity
1,Horrible,This movie is a waste of time. DO NOT watch it. Makes no sense and is not entertaining. Actors and Actresses should be embarrassed they were a part of it.I turned it off half way through. The producers owe me $4.25 in rental fees and 45 minutes of my life back.
2,Welcome to Stepford,"""The Stepford Wives"" is no more than a big named cast that all took a back seat to a robotic puppy that stole the show in only about 2 minutes of screen time. Too bad the filmmakers were unable to put a chip in us that would have made us like their movie."
1,Nothing Like the Original,We watched 32 minutes...until the Robot-Lie shrieks from some nearby Bedroom Flakey Scene--(Not Shown!) Thank God! I cut out for bedroom but Herself watched about 10 minutes more...? For veteran screeners Big disappointment in spite of Nicole Herself!Taking Back... Unscratched! Retired Chap Fred W. Hood
3,Imagine 'Desperate's' Bree Van De Camp without a mean streak,"...or *any* streak for that matter--that's what you get with this updated version of the haus fraus from hell, the Stepford Wives. What this movie really shows is that only shallow folks would even desire these amina-tronic spouses and gigantic Ken and Barbie dolls. And no one on earth can be that shallow. (or can they?) Desperate HW's Bree, we will find out, is a borderline psychotic who craves perfection (ala Serial Mom, also, come to think of it) because of her seeming loss of control at a critical point in her life. Stepford's mates redux are someone else's idea of how to control folks, you will find out in this show. In the movie we also get the pluses of full throttled ham-ons of Midler and (look closely) Kidman and Close, albeit Midler may have been told to restrain herself. Cute show, but I prefer the horror and conspiratorial tone of the original. See this version anyway."
4,A Dark Comedy...sorta,"When I first saw the previews I wasn't so sure about the movie, but as I saw them more and more I thought it might be worth a try. So I went to see it and I was pleasantly surprised.The entire movie has this kind of creepy vibe to it, but in a good way. Nothing is creepier than Glenn Close...something about her is just weird, and it shows in this movie.Nicole Kidman is great, but I have to say my favorite character was Bett Midler, she was the funniest. There are a few little jokes here and there, most of them because of her character, Bobby. So, yes I would recommend this movie it is one worth seeing."
1,This movie plain sucked!!!,"This thing was soooo boring and weird that I actually fell asleep watching the darn thing...as soon as I woke up, I went out to the computer room, and surfed the net!! The acting was sub-par for such great names, and the overall story was sooo boring I could not stand the thing....do not rent this movie!!!"
2,Shame on you Frank Oz!,"One reviewer said the best thing about this film was the poster. I disagree. The best thing was the introductory credits. The film is beautifully done, the houses are gorgeous, the landscaping is incredible. I want to move to Stepford! But that's about all that's worthwhile about the film, sad to say. It is not sharp, not clever, not very funny. Just pretty. Turning a classic horror story into a comedy has been done very successfully, but this one just falls flat. Too much style and not anywhere near enough substance."
2,Amazing Cast-Mediocre Movie,"The Stepford Wives was quite a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Nicole Kidman, Glenn Close, Bette Midler, Matthew Broderick and Christopher Walken among others.The acting is pretty good (but nothing great), the humor is poor, and the plot is borderline between average and below average. Moreover, it seems as though the chemistry between Matthew Broderick and Nicole Kidman is not all that great.Bette Midler's character was weak and annoying, and ""Roger"" and his ""friend"" could have been avoided altogether and would not have been missed.On the positive side, Nicole Kidman (as always) is GORGEOUS!Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off.A shame really...In a nutshell, it's a weak movie, and that's about it; No masterpiece here..."
1,Do you know what I saw on TV in my hotel room this morning??,FILMS OF ROBOTS.THERE SHOWING FILMS OF ROBOTS ON TELEVISION.LIFE SIZE JAPANESE ROBOTS DOING TAI CHI AND KATA.PEOPLE ARE FASCINATEDTHE TIME IS RIPE.ROBOTS ARE ALIVE!!!WE WILL NOT HAVE TO SUFFER FORMUCH LONGER NOW MY BROTHERS (!!!)
1,Woman Hating at its finest,"This movie is horrible. Not only are women being replaced by robots but in Frank Oz's view the women bring this on themselves and deserve to be replaced. I could not watch the whole movie, I was so disgusted by his view."
4,Stepford,"Unlike the original 1975 Stepford Wives which was a horror film, this remake was a comedy. It was really funny with a great cast. Bette Midler had some of the best lines and was my favorite."
4,Nice Twist at the End,"This movie had it all. suspense, very good humor, some action but the story line was pretty good. I don't see how some writers didn't get this movie. Exceptional actors I mean like the best stars. And the location was very good. I think the people are really like that in Connecticut lol. Just kidding. But this is a good movie to see and own. I think most will enjoy it. They could have done a better job with the lab scene. But all in all a good movie."
1,DVD DUD,"Great poster art does not a great movie make. Neither does a stellar cast (Nicole Kidman, Matthew Broderick, Bette Midler, Christopher Walken, Glenn Close) and director (Frank Oz).It's rumored THE STEPFORD WIVES (Paramount) had lots of problems during production that resulted in rewrites and reshoots. But the biggest problem was that producer Scott Rudin and writer Paul Rudnick couldn't get a handle on how to update the savage and chilling satire on feminism that drove the Ira Levin novel and the terrific 1975 film of which this is a hopelessly garbled remake.It's hard to do a movie about ""the battle of the sexes"" when there's no viable gender perspective from the producer and writer. This movie not only has no balls -- it makes no sense, is not scary and barely funny.Remember, time wasted on a bad movie is gone forever.Too bad duped and conned viewers can't unite in a class action lawsuit againt the producer (Scott Rudin here) for ""movie malpractice and time stolen."""
2,Now I know why Republicans are the way they are,I liked everything about the movie except the story. The cast was GREAT! The sets were GREAT! But the story didn't make sense. If they were putting chips in the women's brains why was there a double of Nichole with black eyes? Why did money come out of that other woman's mouth? Bette Midler and that gay guy (I don't know his name) really saved this movie. They were great. I wish the whole robot plot was scrapped and just had these characters running around in a regular neighborhood.
2,Not for Mac User,"The description indicates that it works on Mac platform.But it does not. And the funny thing is the instruction.It says ""if it does not work, try different computer.""Very helpful, isn't it?So I had to use my PC and set up a network w/ Mac and trasnfer.Too much trouble if you have a Mac.However, it's easy to use. Hook up and click, click. that's it."
1,Doesn't work with MacOS X Leopard (10.5),"The description says it works with MacOS X 10.1 or above. This is a lie. I have an Intel MacOS laptop running the latest 10.5.4 and this device is not recognized. I have written to SmartDisk TWICE and have received no answer. Apparently Verbatim bought SmartDisk a little while ago and while they still claim to have Tech. Support, in reality it appears as though Verbatim doesn't care about these devices.Too bad. It was a nice device!"
5,20 GB of Heaven,"I usally take my laptop on trips to hold my daily pictures - Yes I take hundreds on pictures - the Fotocube holds all.I found this product very easy to use.The Twoway USB connection is ""Priceless"".Not sure how long the battery lasts but I only charged it once - two or three weeks ago - used it a couple of times. The battery is still at full.The best $70 dollars spent - Great Value. Perfect for vacation - the charger works great."
1,Don't buy this item,"Let me start by saying the company I bought this from was fast at sending my order out. I did not try to remedy my situation with them because it would have cost more to ship the item back and forth. The item I received was no good. I got what I paid for which was a cheap laser that doesn't even point straight. Take my advice, spend the money to get something of better quality. I spent alot on the gun and didn't think I needed to spend for the accessories. Don't think like I did (like a dope trying to save a buck!)."
5,Very engaging for my 5 year old,"My daughter got this for a Christmas present when she was 5 years old. As she played this at her friend's house, she knew about it. As she likes crafts, drawing, coloring, Origami, etc., she really loved it and kept going one after another. If your child likes this sort of activity, this is a great pastime. You can keep her occupied for a loooong time. Perfect for a rainy, snowy, stormy or ""too hot to play outside"" day. As the stickers are all in small pieces, I thought it was good for her coordination skills, but be prepared for the mess (trash paper from the small stickers)!"
4,mosaic,My daughter loves them but i suggest starting with the smaller designs first as some children may tire of filling in all of the numbers on the larger ones. it would be nice if the people werent so noticeably caucasion. these days most toys are moving toward features that are less defined.
4,Fun toy,This is a fun project but I must say it takes a long time and many kids don't have the patience. The stickers are tiny and the peeling of each individual one can be tedious and messy. But if your child has the attention span and loves a lengthy project- its a good one.
2,Mediocre quality for the price,"Supposedly this is a $500 bike on sale. I made the mistake of not trying out this specific model prior to purchase online. Two major problems: (1) the parts are poorly machined and in several instances do not fit together well. For example, the plastic sleeves that fit on the seat rail would not slide over the main cross bar. Just poor manufacturing QC (2) the pulse monitor handles on either side of the seat (the only ones on the bike) are in a fixed position; given my relatively short arms, I cannot reach them, rendering all the features useless (e.g. having the bike keep you at 75% max heart rate). This is a terrible design flaw. I regret this purchase and am kicking myself for buying online without trying one out at a brick and mortar store. In fact, buying something this heavy, effectively ruling out a return to Amazon, is not a good idea."
1,Purchase mistake,The item took two weeks to get to my home when it was supposed to take one.The bike was missing parts that had to be shipped from the company.After the bike was put together the screen wouldn't come on.After the screen was fixed there was a clicking sound within the front wheel.Nearly two weeks of notifying the company parts to fix the the clicking sound are still waiting to be received.
1,Broke after a few months,Only got to use it 3 or 4 times and it broke. RCA wants $50 to fix. Stay away from RCA! Piece of junk.
2,Not impressed,"I purchased the dvd player 2 months ago for our summer trips. We have used the player 4 times (4 movies) during this time. We plugged it in last night to watch another movie, and the main unit would not power up. It is a little inconvienient that there is not a battery with it - you can only plug it in to a car or outlet. I contacted RCA to ask what external battery would work best for this unit and their response was to contact a local entertainment center - Not a good sign if the makers won't help."
1,You get what you pay for,This product simply does not work properly. It skips even when the car isn't moving and often doesn't recognize disks without taking them out and resinserting several times. I would give it 0 stars if that was an option.
1,RCA Dual screen portable dvd players,we bought this for our 3 children. it worked great for the first 3 months and then it quit for no reason. the children never touched it! we took it back to the store and they exchanged it (military store) and the replacement worked great for 3 months and quit also. i don't think it's made with quality parts to last. 3 months life for 2 seperate systems. that's bad for the price. will not buy RCA again. everyone told us sony is the best. could it be the rca system can't stand the heat inside the car???
2,Bad cable connection,"The DVD Player itself is fine, but the connection cable is the problem. It doesn't fit properly in the socket, so in order to watch both screens, you have to hold the cable in. So I will have to go and purchase a new cable and hope that it works properly."
2,"RCA DRC629N - if it worked, it might be a good product...","I can't review what this product is supposed to do since when I received mine it didn't work!But...it came in a nice bag that holds all the wires and components with a little extra room so you can add a few DVD's or even a small DVD case/holder. The screens attach to the back of the car seat head-rests nicely. I had to rearrange the straps a little to be sure that it didn't slip off our headrests, but it wasn't hard to do, and once you attach the back plate, the screens can be taken off and put back on in a matter of seconds. I like that feature a lot! Unfortunately I can't say anything about the player itself since it never worked for us. We are VERY dissatisfied with the lack of support we have received from the seller and are currently working with RCA directly to try to fix this. I am hoping to receive another one within a few weeks that works. I will give it another try."
2,Quite disappointed,"The player worked fine at home but once in the care it either died out after 30 minutes on the one new disk it would play or it didn't play at all. Had to keep playing the same Strawberry Shortcake disk over and over. The seller was great though, no hassle refund and support!"
1,Didn't work!,Got this DVD player and it skipped while driving in our van and it did not play all of our dvds. Unsure why it did not work on some dvds. Sent it back!
1,Lasted three months,"I purchased the RCA DVD player three months ago. Now, it doesn't work. It doesn't sense the DVDs --it just keeps making noises and says loading, and then it fails. I am very disappointed."
3,Great product when it is not skipping,"We bought this dvd player to entertain our daughter on long trips in the car. It worked fairly well on the interstate, but not so great within the city. Anywhere there are bumps or turns, the player tends to skip or get hung up. I was disappointed at how sensitive it is."
1,Broke after less than 3 months,"This product failed after less than 3 months of regular use....I get the No Disc error although a DVD is in the player. Now I have to contact the manufacturer (Thomson who owns RCA's Consumer Electronics Division) but there is no phone number. I emailed them over two weeks ago and have not heard back from them. This is simply terrible, terrible customer service and I am stuck with an inoperable portable DVD player. I am going on vacation in a month too so this could not have happened at a worse time.Do not buy this product or anything from RCA!!"
2,Not sturdy enough,These would be fine if you dont have kids or dont plan on having anything pushed up against them. Both screens broke and i never even go to use them. It would be great if you could actually get them off the base if you do have to put something in your car but you cant cause they get stuck and you have to take the whole thing apart especially since i have the cords under a seat cover it makes it even worse. Also if you dont have them riged with a seat cover the velcor bothers the person sitting in front of them. Such a waste of money. definetly look into a different product even if its a few bucks more.
4,Worth the price,We received the purchase very fast. The product comes with everything you need. You can't beat the value.
3,I don't think I would buy this again,We got this dual screen for christmas for our 4 kids. It has worked really good for the past 3 months until about 3 weeks ago. The second screen cuts out or all of sudden stops playing for no reason. I paid about $200 for this and I was hopping it would last a few years. One screen still works but that is no good for all 4 children. I don't think I would buy this again. I am going to purchase a vehicle with the dvd player already in it.
1,Do not buy this! Mine went bad after a few months!,"I rarely write reviews of products, but the performance of this product warrants it. All I can say is, we had it for a few months, and used it only occasionally (i.e. on trips) and stored it indoors. One day during a trip we were plugging it in, and......... nothing. No power light or anything. I am an electrical engineer, so I know electronics pretty well, so it is not an issue with the car. There is 12V getting to the unit. I am going to tear these things apart and try to diagnose the problem, but all I can say is that my father bought an Insignia at the same time for the grandkids, and it has worked fine. I have also owned a Cyberhome single DVD portable, and that is junk too. I have already torn it apart and I think I can fix it (power jack solder joint is cracked). Hopefully the RCA is just as easy. SAVE YOUR MONEY, buy something else."
1,horrible,"I had one of these players for 6 months and it stopped playing giving a ""no disc"" error. I ate the cost, bought another one and it started doing it in 3 wks! I called RCA and they told me that I would have to pay to have it shipped to a work station and then pay to get it fixed (under warranty!). We had another RCA about 6 years ago and it still worked. I gave it away when we got the dual screen ones as we have another child now. Don't buy it!"
3,Bumpy and Dissapointed,"When we purchased these we thought they would be perfect for those long car rides, and at first they were, however if you go over a bump or a dip the whole movie starts back over. This is very frustrating. We tried to tighten the straps on to the seat more and we still had the same problem, we ended up just letting the kids hold the player. This helped, it was not the most ideal but it did solve the problem of it skipping."
1,Stopped working after 4 months,"When this DVD player works it's fantastic. We got it after Thanksgiving and used it flawlessly for a road trip. Then all of a sudden one day we got the ""NO DVD"" message. It doesn't matter if it's an old DVD or brand new. The thing won't work. We are very disappointed!"
3,Worked great initially,"This product was worth it's weight in gold for a year. It worked absolutely fabulous with clear sound and a great picture during this time. However, now the primary screen with the DVD player does not work. The picture will not come on and none of the DVD player buttons work. We can get it to work (sometimes) on the second screen when it is plugged into the DVD player. So now, we have one screen up for our son, the primary one plugged in and sitting on my console, and every time we turn it on, we pray it will work!Obviously, longevity is not it's strong point. We were happy with the product up until it went crazy on us."
1,A true waste of money,"We looked around before we brought this product. We thought since it was RCA it would be good, after all we had an RCA TV that lasted for years.Boy were we WRONG. We purchased it for long car trips and took care of it. We always kept it in it's case when not in use. We used it maybe 4 times. On one trip it just quit working for no reason. It won't play any of the kids disks. It is complete junk. After $150 and only a few uses, it was a great disapointment."
2,Not too impressed!,"I purchased this product and I tried it and it would not play any of my DVD's. I thought it was because they were all too old. I played a brand new one and it still wouldn't play, so I returned the product for a new one. I tried the second one and the picture would keep fading out so I would have to keep pulling the plug and plugging it back in. Very inconvenient! I returned for yet another one and this one seems to be okay so far...I felt like it should have worked the first time."
3,DUAL SCREEN DVD,THIS WAS THE SECOND ORDER DUE TO THE FIRST PLAYER NOT WORKING. THE VIEW SCREEN AND PICTURE QUALITY ARE OK. IT WILL SERVE AS A OCCUPIER FOR OUR SON WHILE IN HIS CAR SEAT SO THE QUALITY OF THE PICTURE IS NOT AS IMPORTANT AS IT WORKING CORRECTLY. NO BELL OR WHISTLES ON THIS UNIT JUST A PLAYER AND A REPEATER SCREEN. QUALITY OF THE UNIT IS A LITTLE ON THE LOW END WHICH IS WHY THE PRICE IS A LITTLE HIGH. THE COMPANY I PURCHASED IT THOURGH WAS GREAT IN RETURNING THE FIRST UNIT!
5,"UNA ANTOLOGIA, O SEA, ¡LO MEJOR DE LO MEJOR !","y en verdad, si.Esta colección es especialmente bella.No encuentras NI UN SOLO NOMBRE FEO !"
1,1mg of chlorophyll,This is a terrible product because it does not provide an adequate dose of chlorophyll. It is basically an expensive breath mint.
3,No long term help,"It's a quick breath freshener sure to the mintI'm about 3 weeks into it but don't notice any difference unless I have to stay on it forever, which probably isn't good due to the peppermint oil might irritate stomach with prolonged use"
4,Help to Breath well and keep your nose clean,"This Chlorophyll have good results, when you take it after a meal, your feel your ears and nose clean, the mint helps to clean all your nose and ears working fron inside to outside, you feel fresh and the skin too, be carefull do not take this pills before a meal, maybe causes a burn stomage, in resume is a good product. I recomended."
5,Meet Kaya book review,"I read Meet Kaya, an American girl.I thought it was a really good book because I think Kaya is a cool character. Kaya is an Indian girl who loves to racehorses. Kaya races a boy named Raven because he makes fun of her horse. Kaya races Raven but her horse tries to buck her off. After the race is over Kaya has to find her brothers because she asked her blind friend Speaking Rain to watch her two brothers Wing feather and Sparrow while she races and then she lost them. Kaya is mad when all the kids call her Magpie. But she gets used to it because her grandmother Aalah tells her that her brother called her finger cakes and her friends still call her that for a joke.I recomend this book to anyone at any age level."
3,Not as good as they say,"I have several other planes and ordered this one on the strength of the reviews. I have to say it was a disappointment: the throat is unevenly cut, the body has nicks and spots of rust, and the japanning has chipped in places. The iron was far from keen and the rear handle is set too close to the frog to allow a comfortable grip. Anyone who thinks this plane is going to be 'just like the old Stanley' is going to be disappointed, too."
2,Not that great,"This book wasn't terrible, but it seemed to be poorly written. It had it's moments, but I just thought that the hero and the heroine fell in love too quickly. This book lacked the passion and fire that I like. The lead characters really didn't seem to have any chemistry. Also, many times, the book seemed kind of fake and clicheish. I don't think the writer did alot of research regarding the Chinese basis of this book. Alot of the information based on that seemed to be copied from some B-grade martial arts movie. I don't know, maybe the people who make B-grade martial arts movies do do the right research for this stuff. The main thing that soured me to the book was that the description made me think the heroine would be this strong person, which I like. But, it just seemed that she still always had to be forever rescued by the men, even though she's supposed to be this martial arts expert."
1,this book is from the schismatic Soc. of St. Pius X,"Total consecration to Mary is incredibly important and valuable. However, this book is by a priest of the schismatic Society of St. Pius X and is published by Angelus Press, that group's publishing company. They do not accept the authority of our Pope and are out of communion with Rome. The book has much valuable material but cannot be trusted because of this. There are other resources, some free (search total consecration to Mary) to help you take this very important step for your own benefit and that of the world.God bless!"
4,Best Italian Pocket Dictionary,"This is best Italian pocket dictionary for the traveler. It actually has the pronunciations of the Italian words (what a novel idea). It's verb summary is adequate and it includes the helping verbs (avere and essere) at the front of the list, where they can be quickly found (unlike the Berlitz dictionary where they are buried in with all the other verbs. It's shortcomings are that it includes fewer expressions and not as many entries at the Berlitz, but it's smaller and lighter. Go with this one for travel, especially if you're new to Italian."
2,Roto light,I used this light for 3 shows and it no longer spins. I have not taken it apart to find out why. It was allways sticky and i had to spin it by hand to get it going. Its cheap but u would spend the money elswhere. 2 stars because it worked good for 2 shows.
1,Horrible!!!!!!!!,"This light is a piece of crap. It spins to fast, there is to many lights, and it gets to hot and smells like smoke. I if would be you I would not purchase this item. This is NOT worth my $70.00. DON'T BY THIS ITEM!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Just ok,"not led, duty cycle, does not really do anything other than spin (too fast) and for this type of light to bright"
3,I gets really hot,I returned this light because it got really hot. It got to where it smelled like burned plastic IDK if it was just mine but I didnt want to take a chance. From now on im sticking to LED only.
3,Not bad for the price,Cool light and I'm sure that it will add to our show. I am a little disappointed that it doesn't have a speed control because it does rotate fairly quickly and would look much better in the fog a little slower or with fewer lights. Over all though it wasn't expensive so it fits my budget.
3,"Good, but could be better.","I wish it had a speed control knob. Also, there are too many lights. My old one has much fewer lights and spun slower. It was a better effect much like police lights. This unit also showed up a little warped, but I think it helps the effect because it kind of wobbles up and down, however, it does also make a clicking noise, so I really don't know if this is normal or not. Overall, it wasn't much money and it's still a useful effect that adds to the show."
4,"The hardships, the highs, the attitudes....","Although uneven, this book is nevertheless a good accounting of the great adventure of the 60s and early 70s, the trek to India. If you made this trip, as I did in 1972, it will flashback the hardships, the highs, and the attitudes. If you didn't, this book will let you taste what you missed.Travelling through Asia and the Middle East was for the hippies what road travel was for the beatniks. And just as there is a masterpiece of that experience of the beats, Kerouac's ""On The Road,"" there is a masterpiece of the hippie experience, Cleo Odzer's ""Goa Freaks."" Read Cleo's book now!"
2,"Too lengthy in words, too mediocre in story","This book was a visual treat with a soft, whimsical style of art. I praise it for that. I opened it hoping to find a classic fairytale but instead the story seemed muddled and confused about what it was trying to be. Things felt too stereotypical and there was nothing fresh or new. I was constantly reminded of other classic (and more coherent) fairytale stories as I read through this one.Not only is it overly long and a bit dull in its tone, (making it almost tedious at times to finish), it also lacked any originality aside from the colorful illustrations. I wouldn't recommend this book, unless your child is okay with sitting still for a long while to listen to a very wordy story."
3,Detailed and colorful art ... a story full of imagination,Beautiful detailed illustrations and a story to make your child's imagination run wild. Also be sure to check out The Faerie's Gift by the same author / illustrator team. It's magical and heartwarming.
4,they need modification,these are sensative to sun light. if a sunny day and you turn it will treat it as a hit. You only get so many hits before noise goes off that you have been hit too many times and are out of game. I purchsed about 20 of these for Sunday School class so I can guarantee all are sensative like this.put a small square piece of grey duct tape over sensor and it no longer is sensative to sunlight but will work if shot at from about 40-50 ft away. Now for the adults playing I opened them up and put a small piece of duct tape on inside too and now you have to be shot from 25ft or closer. If you want it to look good just put duct tape on inside and works just same as if on outside but without the tape showing. I had so many I got tired of opening them all so I put it on outside.Battery life is good on them too.
4,laser command advance team playset,"My kids have fun with this toy but it would be better if it didn't constantly make a pinging sound so that they could be stealthier and sneak up on each other. Plus, the pinging makes it really annoying if played indoors.Holly"
3,"Molly was a cook, but Gertrude Berg wasn't","I was curious about the cookbook; thought Gertrude Berg really had a hand in it, but after seeing a documentary about her, realized she must have just leant her name to this book ... because Gertrude Berg wasn't a cook. She even had to learn how to hold a knife for the TV show. The recipes are okay ... only a couple interested me ... but for a novice cook wanting some Jewish recipes, it's probably okay."
4,"Old, authentic recipes","Thirty-six years ago, I attended a party where cheese blintzes were served. It was my first blintz, and I had never tasted anything so delicious. I asked the hostess about the recipe and she handed me the Molly Goldberg Jewish Cookbook. I went out and bought this paperback ($.95, I believe!). There is a Jewish Deli in Cincinnati, Izzy's, and my husband had always enjoyed their Lima Bean Soup. I called Izzy for the recipe, and he laughed me off the phone ... wouldn't share. Well, lo and behold, a recipe was right there in Molly Goldberg. I have made this soup ever since. Lima Bean Soup was the Thursday soup, and they have at last removed it from the menu. I guess this recipe is not modern enough. But it is certainly authentic."
3,Death of a Neutron Star,"I don't know much about stars but thankfully, I did understand quite a bit of it in Eric Kotani's ""Death of a Neutron Star"". Janeway and her Voyager crew was there to save the day and I liked this story because of the action, adventure and even suspenseful scenes that it created in my imagination. We all know Captain Janeway would help anyone and here, she found a way to avoid the destruction of homeworlds and this she did with the help of Seven, B'Elanna, Tuvok, Paris, Kim, Chakotay, etc plus help from new friends Dr. Maalot and Lieutenant Tyla. I thought the Doctor would not be in it but appeared at the very end too. :) I enjoyed this book and would recommend this to anyone who likes Star Trek Voyager. :)"
1,Too technical,"I feel that this book is way too technical. I mean, I know that I'm still a kid but usually I can follow a story line without having to stop and try to figure out what they're talking about. I don't suggest buying this book."
2,I agree--God help us all. There are better Trek writers.,"Mr. Kotani, to me, obviously knows little or nothing about Voyager, its captain, and crew. This novel is science and plot driven, but I believe that it needs a great deal more than just being a repetive action and cliff-hanger plot book. I do not wish to slam Mr. Kotani personally, but he should acquaint himself with the characters in this interesting series. Christine Golden does an excellent job as a writer and getting into Janeway's mind. I suggest that you read her book in the Voyager series. This is the first review I have written under my new nick name; I reviewed The 34th Rule just recently and I believe many readers would enjoy it. In the original series, I tend to like Uhura's Song best. Both of these books are strong in plot, characterization and values that should have us thinking about events on earth."
1,What a boring book,"Sure the story line was OK but everything sounded too easy to me how there was an area of space that the Neutron Star could go without killing any life and Voyager was able to make sure that the star went that way! Come on!Read Black Shore or Seven of Nine, much better"
3,One of a kind anomoly? Sure let's look!,"Astronomical anomolies and Star Trek go hand in hand. Just like the premise of many ST stories, Death of a Neutron Star is self explanitory as far as the setting and the man versus nature plot.The novel itself is ok as far as story development and the sequence of logical events. (Except for the use of available warp cores around pages 230-233)."
1,"Can you say, stupid?",This book is probably the dumbest book I ever read. It is stupid in plot and even the concept is corny. I evil mask. Whoo hoo hoo! I'm trembling in my boots! Tell me where does an author of good books come up with such a dumb idea for a book? I mean come on! R.L. Stine you can do better than this!
5,THE BEST GOOSEBUMPS BOOK!,"Attention all Goosebumps fans. You have to buy this book. It is about a girl named Carly Beth Cadwell who bought a mask from a Party Store and when she put it on, the mask became her real face. It was revenge from two boys named Steve and Chuck. It is the best Goosebumps book I ever read. So read this book!"
4,It happened to a girl and not a guy.,She steals a mask from a shop. She puts it on and turns in to a monster. The girl was stubborn and ignorant.
5,Great! Awesome!,"A girl buys a grusome halloween mask to get back at everybody thats scared her,when she puts it on she cant get it off! It changes her personality and makes her very mean."
3,Masked horror,"Carly Beth is a wimp. Everything scares her. And her friends enjoy teasing her and make her jump. Now she's had it. On Halloween she will use a mask so hideous she'll scare them all. But the mask changes her. You could almost say it becomes part of her...If you can buy into the idea, it's a good story."
5,A Wonderful Book,"A wonderful book, filled with fascinating facts about important people and activities that most ofus have never heard about. I hope it makes more people aware that the original point of electronic computers was to do computing, to speed up the essential work that had been done by human computers for centuries. We often say that electronic computers can do in seconds what used to take months. This book describes what it was like for human computers to actually spend months doing it. Like all good history, this book teaches us that the legacy of human achievement that we enjoy did not grow on trees."
4,Great device...,"The only downside to this is that it is not one of the controllers supported by Ableton out of the box, and it didn't include up to date mappings for Ableton. But with its tools, this is easy enough to create. Mechanically this is a well built controller and the key action is first class."
2,NOT Stanley & Screws Useless,"The product as shipped is under the National brand name, NOT Stanley. It is rugged and the correct size but does not look EXACTLY the same as the Stanley product pictured. The outer hanging ring is just a tad smaller diameter than the Stanley. It is still highly usable but be prepared to provide your own screws. The white screws supplied are USELESS because the Phillips heads are cut so poorly that no Phillips head screwdriver on the planet will drive the screws."
5,The best bracket,"I love Stanley plant brackets. They are strong, look good and do what they are supposed to do (hold plants up). I like the design also because it is simple. Highly recommended!"
3,"Not one of the best Parkers, but still a Parker","Westlake/Stark's first (I think) riff on ""The Maltese Falcon"" isn't quite a good fit for the Parker series (his later comic crime novel ""Dancing Aztecs"" does it better). This is definitely one of the lesser Parker novels: the caper isn't very interesting, and the supporting cast all seem a bit too goofy for Parker. Still, this is a Parker novel and so is a pretty good read nonetheless."
4,One of my favorite Parker novels,"I really enjoyed ""The Mourner"". One thing that I found interesting is that the objects to be stolen actually do exist; a little while after I read this book I happened to read an article about the statues elsewhere. We also get the sense (that isn't present in later books) that the object of Parker's desire has more value that mere money, but that to many, there is an emotional aspect to the score that only Parker is divorced from.J.Ja"
4,Has not burned down house,"They're fuses, so there isn't much to say about them. I've been using the same brand for decades with no problems. Would have given them 5 stars if they could make my coffee in the morning, but they are only fuses."
2,cargo liner,I could have easily purchased a tarp and velco strips for the same results and a much lower price. Could be nice for lazy people though
1,NOT MACHINE WASHABLE!,"I purchased this for my older dog who has ""accidents"". Anyway, the mat worked great the first time. However, as soon as I washed it the waterproofing material began to fall apart on the bottom side of the mat. I did not put in the dryer, only washed it. It is no longer usable as a waterproof cover. Do not buy this if you plan to wash it!!!"
2,STICKY MESS,This matte comes with velcro strips that have an adhesive backing to adhere to the flatbed of the car. But the heat of the summer warms up the glue leaving a sticky mess and a matte that just slides around. I would not buy a matte that relies on glue to keep the matte from sliding.
1,What's the big deal,"This product could be called any number of things but it certainly is not large enough to cover most (if any) SUV's and be called a cargo liner. A cheaper and far more substantial way to go is with a piece of indoor/outdoor carpet cut to size; or better still, not cut to size but cut a bit larger to where it will come up the sides of your cargo area for a little ways to keep the dirt and debris from falling into the cracks and crevices in your cargo area and also help protect the doors and handles in this area. All home improvement stores sell indoor/outdoor carpet by the inch in six-foot widths in many colors that will come close to matching your vehicle's interior,(not the green stuff that looks like astro-turf). This stuff is far more substantial and durable than this ""cargo liner""."
1,Didn't work for me,This didn't work for me. It was too big for my SUV and the adjustments to try to make it fit didn't either. If it just laid flat it would have been better. I need a smaller size so I returned it.
4,Does the job - but could be bigger,"This mat was what I was looking for. I wanted something that I could lay in the back of my van and catch any dirt and sand that would fall off things I loaded from things such as from a trip to the beach. I could easily pull it out and shake out the sand then put it back in. I didn't care what color it is but I think it only comes in beige. There are velcro tabs on the back that help hold it in place. You can keep them covered if you want to drag it across the bottom - which I want to do when I put stuff on it and can't reach it - it just makes it easier to reach. It also prevents spills from leaking into the floor of the van. I had another one that was larger and thicker that I really liked. This is a smaller and lighter version of that - but it still did the job just fine - except when ALL the seats are folded away, it doesn't cover everything. I just wish it were another foot or two longer."
1,"Solvit, I don't think so!","So it looked good, we bought it and immediately the stability rod was broken. When I contacted their Customer Service with a kind note that all I wantedwas a replacement rod, they never had the decency to respond let alone send me another. I wouldn't deal with these people who do not have any respect for their customers. I guess it's all about profit with total disregard for consumer satisfaction. My dogs are more considerate than they are,on a bad day!"
2,Solvit Waterproof SUV Cargo Liner,I think the material is fine but the Velcro like strips sewn to the bottom have proven most dificult to work with and do NOT stick to the rug in the 1997 Tahoe. I am sure it can be rigged up somehow to make it lay flat but my dogs have it all crumpled up in the corner. It is going to take modification on my part to make it work.
4,Good product for the money,"This is a good product for the money. Especially good for SUV's where the seats fold up/down. Unlike molded plastic liners, these liners are easy to fold up and put out of the way when seats are upright."
3,waterproof liner,"This product looks good, but I have a large SUV and the liner is not large enough to fit across the cargo space. That was a little disappointing."
2,Works OK,"This product is OK it just did not work well for us. Unless the back of your vehicle is the perfect size you have to be creative to get this to stay in the car. We had to fold part of it over which makes it hard to keep those corners down. There have also been several holes worn in the material with limited use over 2 years. It works when you get down to it but so does a tarp, there are better options out there."
3,good quality but too big,"This item would probably be great in a bigger cargo area. It was too big for my GMC Terrain, and wouldn't stay in place, so I returned it."
4,Mystical Intensity,"Denis Quinn captures the heart in this heavenly music. It is however not so ethereal as grounded in its powerful lyrics in Italian, Greek and Hebrew as well as its heartfelt melodies. It is the second time I have bought this CD for myself. The day I found that my old CD was scratched I went immediately to buy a new one. Songs such as Allah, Halelujah, Elohim instantly life the sprits no matter what the issue. It is one of the most beautiful CD's you'll ever buy."
3,Motive for a mission: What is the books motive?,"It is hard to tell if this is a story of Rudolph Hess, the Nazi war criminal, or Rudolph Hess, the misplaced peacenick. Albrecht Haushoffer is portrayed as a German-Jewish confidant of Hess, who is a confused member of the underground. I believe that Lord Hamilton is too complimentary to the memory of these men. It is a good, strange story worthy of further analysis. Book is heavy footnoted. It is amazing that all this material survived."
1,A terrible printing.,"This book was ""printed"" on cheap paper, all in black and white. It looks like it was Xerox'd and then bound. My purchase was a terrible mistake. Review other professionally produced German text books."
1,Are you a middle-aged housewife?,"I was sleeping and cringing through this book...basically a compilation of the life events of these women, and i guarantee you that it is nothing exciting enough to warrant a book! These new authors are so ""egg-cited"" to write a book that they got carried away with the chicken catch phrases. Unless your ""little chicks have left the nest"" i recommend that you don't crack this egg open."
5,"At the doctors office, he had to wait for me to finish.","I found this book at my doctors office and I became so engrossed with the stories I actually told him to wait for me to finish the section I was on. This book is fun and sad, quite the emotional ride of everyday life. Enjoy... I did."
3,Bad Sound,"I have this t.v. The picture is great, The DVD is great, The vhs is great, But the sound is way to low. I have to set in front of the set just to hear it very low. Can not get the sound louder. Tryed everything. And when my 3 months warranty was up so was the T.V."
1,tops keep coming off,All three tops had to be glued as they would come off as soon as you put it in your palm
2,Good book...if you're a communist!,"I had to see what all the fuss was about, so I finally read Jungle. It started out pretty good, about an immigrant who struggles in a new country, trying to find work and housing. At the end of the book (and after many more unsuccessful struggles faced by the immigrant) Sinclair suggests that Socialism is the ideal way to guarantee work and shelter for everyone in the form of a speech given by a motivational speaker at the end of the book. This is in a manner reminiscent of John Galt's speech in Atlas Shrugged, also at the very end of the book. In both speeches, the author reveals their philosophy, but if your looking for true motivation from within, read the latter."
4,An Eye Opener,"For me this book was a real eye opener in relation three areas. 1.Immigrant life in the 1800s. It is a sad commentary on the US governement, and how they allowed people to be treated as nothing more than animals. It makes one appreciate the struggles our ancestors went through to make a life for themselves and their future families. 2. The roots of Unions for the US workers. 3. The method used to process meat. Hopefully it has significantly improved since that time period...it's amazing more people didn't die from the food they ate. It has been more than a year since I read the book and still look hesitantly at the meat counter. The story is a good reason to consider becoming a vegetarian."
4,An amazing exposé into immigrant life in the early 1900s,"Although The Jungle is known primarily for its descriptions of the meat packing industry, this book is about much more. Sinclair brilliantly presents the life of a poor immigrant family searching for the American dream.Jurgis experiences the highest levels of wealth as a politician and the lowest levels of poverty as a beggar. Although his repeated reversals of fortune are quite exaggerated, Sinclair effectively makes his point. He shows the huge gap between rich and poor and governmental corruption.The last several chapters disappointingly lose the personal touch of Jurgi's experiences. Sinclair ends the novel with what amounts to direct socialist propaganda. It too certainly makes a convincing point (probably the main point Sinclair wanted to make), but it leaves the reader wanting a conclusion to Jurgi's character."
1,Poorly written,"Is this a biography or a novel? I have read about Earl Manigault before and the story is tragic. This treatment is an example of a ""writer"" putting himself into a biography. He writes as if he is talking to the subject, which makes reading this story a trying experience. The word you is used so often it becomes annoying to the reader. I really do not think the ""author"" has any literary ability at all."
2,Four Short Stories - not one of Peterson's best,"I am a huge Tracie Peterson fan but these four short stories (novellas) were too shallow and predictable for me. Since it is Christmas the stories were relevant, and since we have servicemen and women overseas the stories were certainly poignant. However, I think the third story was my favorite and one which could have happened to any couple in love and impatient during a war situation as Tracie wrote about WWII. That one, alone would get 4 stars, the others would not."
3,"Ok, but not great","This is a good collection of novellas. The common theme is WW2 and Christmas. There are 5 sides of serviceman relationships here. First is a story about a returning vet, who has to deal with survivor guilt. Second is a story about a man stranded who thinks that his girl may have found someone else AND a man back home who has somehow never been drafted. Third is the story about the impulsive marriage that leaves a young woman alone to give birth to their child. Lastly is a story about two people who put off getting married until they finally decided the war was too great a risk not to get married.I enjoyed each of the stories, but the relationships were left hanging. You don't really know what happened--did everyone make it back alive? The only story you get some kind of closure on is the first one, and only then because you are able to pick up the clues in other stories.All in all, it's a good book, but I wouldn't buy it---I would borrow it from the library."
5,Great product,"This little piece of software and hardware combination works great. I had a bad problem with colors being different in my color managed applications (adobe photoshop, rawshooter premium) and my windows using a Samsung LCD screen. Calibrating the colors using colorvision solved this - now I have consistent and precise colors throughout. It's simple to setup and run. Just remember to turn of your screensaver / powersaving mode when running this because if your screen goes off in the middle of the process you will not get a working profile."
2,Not working upon install,"Just installed this on Windows XP today. It seemed to install & run, but when it finished going through its rather lengthy procedure (colors changing on monitor white/black/R,G,B) I received a runtime error with report to send to Microsoft. Tried restarting/ unplugging/ etc. but still doesn't work. Their web site had no real useful info on debugging or common error info. It also states they're closed until the first of the year, so we'll have to wait a week+ to see if it really works; I'll pass on giving my final rating for now."
5,This book is great,"This is one of 3 books that I recommend if you want to learn C and C++. In fact, I think so highly of it that I have had to purchase it several times because I keep giving my copies to friends (who also think highly of it)."
3,Nice but not all there,"Can't beat the price. But, the green light bulb didn't work. I've seen the light in action and it's exactly what I thought it would be but haven't fully tested out for any party. I 'm giving it 3 stars because the product's price is right but with faulty bulbs which feel very cheap."
1,Piece of junk,Do not buy this. Two of my bulbs have quit and one of the sockets is not working. Get a led unit instead.
3,Good for the price,For a larger stage this unit is not big enough. but for other applications it is good. I am not sorry I bought it.
3,eliminator lighting,I use it in my store front to draw attention to the store...it works just fine...not exactly what I wanted but for its low price it works just fine
1,Do not waste your money!,"This is a thin cardboard kit that is lame! It takes forever to punch all the little holes and then I could never get the northern and southern hemispheres to stay connected. My 7 year old and I never even got to try it out on the light bulb because it was so flimsy and would not hold together. The tape is ridiculous and I had no idea until I read these reviews that it was 2 sided--that's how bad it was! Waste of time and money. Manufacturer belongs in the toy ""hall of shame!""My 7 year old's thoughts are:""So, parents do not waste your money on a very dumb toy!!!"""
3,Fun to build,I built this with my nine-year-old daughter. I used a small finishing nail locked in a pair of vise-grips for piercing the holes in the constellations. My daughter had fun doing this. You push down on the light to turn it on & off (4 AA's). Double-stick tape is a little tough to work with but the cardboard patterns are accurate and fit together well. We put it in her room & she was impressed with the ceiling pattern it projected. Would be more educational to have a color paper map to study while looking at the ceiling.
2,There is a reason why the best outdoor gear is usually expensive..,"If you are looking for comfort, this sleeping pad isn't really it. It obviously does its job by giving you that extra few degrees of warmth since you are not sleeping directly on the ground. It is also extremely light, so that is good for backpackers. I had to live in a tent for about 3 months because I was working in state parks in California, so for me comfort was important. After the first night using this pad, I decided to get a different one. It felt the same as if I were just sleeping without a sleeping pad and on the ground. Only perk is that it is cheap and light weight. Obviously if you want a sleeping pad that is more comfortable, you'll have to shell out the cash.."
4,Great for camper on a budget,"For the price you can't beat this pad.It definitely serves its purpose, and for its pricepoint you won't find anything comparable.This is not a product for someone who is looking for a lot of padding, but it is very lightweight and will serve its purpose well. For people on a budget, like myself it is a perfect pad. Doesn't offer too much comfort as the pad is pretty thin, but it does cover any odd bumps and stones/etc in the ground.I would recommend this product for anyone who is young and on a budget and doesn't need a lot of padding. Not too bulky and pretty lightweight so a good option for backpackers, and hey if it gets lost/torn you can just buy another because they are so cheap."
2,"Eh, you can do better.","Okay for the price. I got this as a temporary until I find a good one I want to really buy. It's okay, but if you got the extra cash, go with something better."
5,Garden of Wellness is wonderful!,"I ordered Lori Lite's Garden of Wellness for my five year old daughter who was having some bad dreams and was a bit scared when going to sleep. I play these stories for my daughter as she lays falling off to sleep and it helps her to feel more peaceful as she drifts off. I often lay with my daughter and listen. Listening to the calm voice and soothing music calms me as well. All of Lori's products are wonderful. I have used other products, books and cd's, with my 11 year old son. These products help soothe his anxiety as well. I highly recommend all of Lori Lite's products."
3,cute but too narrow,I bought these for my daughter to wear but they were really narrow. She loved the way they looked but unfortunately they cut into her feet. Just be aware that these shoes are fairly narrow.
4,BEAUTIFUL and well-made,"These look so gorgeous on my almost 8-year old's feet! The silver/diamond wreath accent over the foot really looks so beautiful. The straps hold her foot in nicely and the heel looks much daintier than I thought it would. But it is very sturdy. She's never worn a heel of ANY heighth before but she's doing really well in these. They are a little taller looking than I thought they would be... it's right on the border of appropriate for a little girl. Also, her feet sweat in the plasticky sole.... but other than that I'm extremely pleased with the shoe! She is so excited to wear them with her beautiful baptism dress!"
4,Made my daughter feel like a princess!,"Bought these for my six-year-old who is tall for her age. I was nervous that the size 4 would not work with her size 3.5 feet, but they seem to fit fine. I bought them for her to wear as a flower girl in a wedding, so hopefully they will be comfortable for her. So far, though, they're gorgeous and not too high, but high enough that she feels like she's walking the runway. :)"
1,All About Shoes,I Have Twins they just love shoes they had to sleep with the NEW Cind-R-Essa Sandal. Thanks
4,Chocolate is bad for dogs!,"ISBN 0816711542 - Klutzy Missy wagers her beloved dog, Baby, that she can make the soccer team and has to find a way to rise to her own challenge - or poor Baby will have to go live with snobby Stephanie! This a cute little book with a lot of potential for parents who read to or with their kids, or who like to make sure their kids get something out of the books they read. Overcoming obstacles, the negatives of ""gambling"", not judging a book by the cover and the value of teamwork are all built-in lessons to be learned. Pet owners take extra advantage - make sure your kids know that Baby can eat chocolate because he's not real, but your pets are real and chocolate is very bad for them! That oversight aside, it's a good book for the kids as they begin reading ""chapter books"".- AnnaLovesBooks"
2,Not a good read,"Despite the other good reviews on this book, I have found the book not to be a good erotic read. It felt like some sanitized version of a dirty book. There is no eroticism because there is no danger at all. I get the feeling that all will turn out well and that there is nothing to fear.Even when the heroine is being buggered, she shows no feelings of guilt either and her attitude is that of ""Yes, do your worse. I can take whatever you dish out to me."" She may as well be a robot.As for the brother and sister, Damon and Desiree, it's quite obvious that they are non-sexual creatures which get their kicks from other things. Trying to seduce Damon is like trying to turn a heterosexual male into a homosexual. There is plainly nothing exciting in the effort. This book is simply a waste of my time and resources. Both of which has been consumed and lost forever."
2,no directions and no patterns,"this is a book with pictures of things people have made there are no patterns. there is a statement next to a picture like"" so and so made this out of felt and it has jointed legs"", I guess its more of an idea book i was disappointed there are quite a few pictures black and white and color in my opinion most toys are ugly 70s not cool 70s I actually just put the book in the recycle bin."
2,Clamps Didn't Hold Up,"I originally reviewed these clamps are being a good value but unfortunately must now recall that statement. Having only used this clamp a few times, when finally using the clamp in a scenario where higher clamping pressure was needed, the clamp broke.The plastic housing which holds the handle to help ratchet the mechanism split open when attempting to put moderate clamping pressure on two items. I used super glue to reassemble the item but these clamps can't exert any pressure at all when required.The spreader function works after using some effort but again, cannot exert any moderate pressure. A generic parallel clamp by Peachtree I had nearby was able to exert more than 300% more clamping pressure."
4,"Decent quality, and somehow it helped reception I think.","I purchased this headset for 6230 because it provides stereo sound and plus the connector to the phone won't block the charger port. When using this headset you actually get higher volumn than using the handset, it gets pretty loud if you crank it all the way up.I usually get only 1 bar of signal where I work and the calls are always breaking up, but one day I found out if I have the headset plugged in I can actually hear very clearly with still 1 bar of signal, somehow it helped the reception although the user manual of 6230 says the wire is only acting as FM antenna."
4,A fun way to test,"This Jeopardy game is fun, and very realistic. It feels a little soft anc considering that teenagers are going to be using it, I wonder how much it will last, but besides that wonder, it is a very good tool to include in your classroom."
5,Love the product but.....,My students love to play this game. My only complaint is that there are not a lot of math symbols to choose from. I teach Algebra and need to be able to write with exponents!
1,not white,"the coat is great but i dont know if they got my order wrong or is the description is wrong. the one i got is white with really thin black lines, from far you cant see but they are there."
3,Decent player with some flaws,"OVERALL: I purchased this for $70, which is probably what it is worth. It will get the job done, but not gracefully. I would not purchase another Yamaha DVD player, but I'm not rushing to get rid of this one either.Video : good quality output, no problems here. Lots of output types supported.Audio : Again, good quality, digital outputs are great.Mechanical : This is where I have trouble. CD Switching is VERY SLOW. which makes shuffling (primary purpose of multi-disc player, in my opinion) painful. The Open-Close is equal slow. Poor mechanics. Only nice feature is ""play-exchange"" which means that you can switch discs without stopping the current DVD / CD.Remote : ugly, poor button configuration, difficult to use, and the player responds to the remote variably (slow, or sometimes not at all)User Interface: On screen is a nice feature, but ugly. Not very user friendly."
2,Great heat--when it works.,"This throws off great heat, and the thermostat works well. However, more times than not, it will not even turn on, and I have never figured out why. Sometimes it will turn on right away. It is very unpredictable."
5,Very cool.,The poetry info and references are spot-on. I know because I paid a lot of money to get a degree in this stuff.
3,Good for getting thoughts down.,"I love the unlined pages of this book. However, I was a little disappointed with the ""tips."" Maybe I didn't read the description closely enough, but the ""tips"" are quotes from other writers. Either way this book is finding lots of use in my house."
1,Boring,I got this book for one of my college classes called global issues . First off this book is basically a restatement of the millennium goals . Also it has nothing but statics in it i dont like this book at all
3,Adequate book,"This book is targeted at people considering an MBA and those already preparing for and starting their courses. It addresses the necessary basic competencies required for surviving the hectic datelines and complexities - which includes areas of time management, verbal/written communication, personality profile & group dynamics, study skills/techniques, dealing with case studies and numbers, handling assessments, exams & report writing, and career planning.Most of the stuff is ""standard"" stuff and can be applied not only to people who are taking an MBA. Overall, this can be a good starting point for people who have been out of touch with ""going back to school"" and need a refresher."
3,A window to the east,"The Author has a distinct style, sort of voyeuristic. What you get here is a lot of conversations from some of the players from Czechoslovakia, Poland and East Germany before and after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Interesting, but far from being a crucial read."
3,"Slow Start, but smooths out nicely.","Rosenberg's book is divided into 3 sections, each dealing with a newly democratic nation. The first section analyzing Czechoslovakia and the Stb starts off extrememly slow, and almost derailed me entirely from finishing the book, but it pulls you in once you get into the discussions on Jaruzelski and Poland. Overall was a good read, and sends a very good and objective message in the end to how a nation can move on from its totalitarian past. Although Rosenberg's constant referalls to her experiences in Latin America can cometimes be completely irrelevant to the topic at hand and get rather annoying after a while. Good read though..."
2,Book strongly criticized,"""Miss Rosenberg does more than merely deny the moral equivalence of Nazism and Communism; she is saying openly that it is acceptable to question whether the crimes of Stalin were crimes at all.... It is as if she had missed out on a part of her moral education, or was unable to think in one part of her brain."""
1,Someone cleaned out their attic,"This CD's sound quality is very primitive. The recording has a lot of analog hiss to it which goes quite nicely with the music style. You'll feel like you're listening to a favorite old record of your grandparents, if your grandparents were thirties communists. There are better recordings out there of this music. Keep looking."
2,Disappointed,"This item was wanted very much by me, I purchased this item at a high price, I then recieved item and went looking to see my orders, because the case was all broken, I them saw that there were two other items on sale by two individual, with the same description of the condition, when I called them or emailed them to see why they had priced it SO high, I recieved 59.00 back for this cd, its still did not come close to the price the other two were offering this item for. I then recieved an email telling to please change my review on them and I told them to give me my money back, because of the sale price of the other two cd's on sale on Amazon. They did not really comply, I paid $159.59, and the other two items were $11.00 each. What am I to to believe from this place."
2,Did not work for me,Seems pretty simple with CD included. Newer software is online from Nokia--but I could not get connection with Nokia 6820 and gave up. At least the cable was cheap enough. No idea if I failed or cable was incorrect.
4,Works for Nokia 6820 - with a bit of effort,"Connects my old Nokia 6820 to my laptop. Just be aware that it emulates a COM port thru USB. Make sure you have the COM port set correctly in the Nokia PC Suite to match the virtual COM port assigned by the driver. This you can check in the Device Settings in the Control Panel. I need to set the COM port to COM16 every time I plug in the cable.In short, the product works - as long as you are willing to put in a bit of effort. For the price, good value. And it saves me from having to turn on the bluetooth - which is slower and drains the battery faster."
1,Wrong Item Sent,I am unable to give any kind of review for this item since I was shipped the wrong cable. On a positive my payment was refunded and I was not required to return ship the incorrect item.
1,Does not fit all models,"Product cost is very reasonable, and it arrived in good order.However, different phones need different cables.This did not fit my phone, although the model number ofmy phone was listed."
1,Can't get it to work,"I bought this and ran the setup file only to find that the drivers and other files are meant for xp. I have vista so this is no good. I don't have any experience with phone data cables so I cannot figure this out. It would be nice if they included instructions! I get the feeling I just wasted $5...this is not an official nokia cable and I saw posts on a forum about people saying you need different drivers in order for it to work. The links to said drivers had been posted 5 years ago and are now dead. It may be that my 6800 is locked, I'm not sure how to tell if it is or not. Perhaps I should try backing up my contacts with a different phone/cable. Ah well, live and learn..."
1,Proselytizing Pap,"Transatlantic were great. I love Roine Stolt, but I draw the line at Neal Morse's solo projects as he pushes ""Jeezus"" at us like were are sinners and he's got The Answer.When Neal formed the so called ""CPR"" project, I emailed him and told him where to stick Christian Progressive Rock.I don't like being preached at in my rock music from either end of the musical spectrum - so avoid this one and also ""Unweaving The Rainbow"" by Frameshift."
5,No question of the ability of Neal Morse,"I've been reading up on Neal on the net lately. I finally picked up this disc to give it a try. Wise move on my part! I've always had an affinity for prog (Yes, Camel, Saga and such) and I am a Christian also, as a result, this disc really is very special to me. It's not 'preachy' and it doesn't have that CCM Candy feel to it at all. It's real prog. I was almost this enthusiastic when I first discovered Dream Theater, and being that Mike Portnoy (drums) and Jordan Rudess (keys) also play on ? that explains my enthusiasm for this disc. Cprog enthusiasts, feast your ears on this one! This disc is THE new standard."
3,One mod-prog pseudo-epic wannabe religious trip worth taking,"3 1/2Of course it isn't the hour long intense trip into the heart of a God, but aside from a few clunkers, ? is a stimulating if somewhat derivative modern progressive conceptual work that hopefully overshadows some of the potentially offensive Christian positing with many outstanding musical passages and a worthy climax."
2,"Good music, shame about the subject matter","I've been a big Spock's Beard fan for years now (along with Dream Theater, Shadow Gallery, Magellan, Flower Kings etc) and own everything they've ever released. This solo album fits in well with the rest of the band's catalogue music-wise - except that it extols the virtues of God, apparently because Morse has discovered Christianity. I'm fine with the occasional religious reference now and again but when there're constant references and it's in your face, I get turned off. I'm sure there'll be many people who'd disagree with this point of view and to some extent, it should really be only about the music. But when the lyrics start to grate on one's ears, I draw the line. By the same token, I'm sure there'll be a lot of people who feel the same way as I do. If you don't mind such content, then by all means, buy this CD. As for me, I'll probably avoid future releases if the theme doesn't change."
1,I Should Have Read the Reviews More Closely,"If you want to learn a real lesson about this disk, take a look at how many are for sale used: 70 as of this writing. I am a Porcupine Tree fanatic and acted too quickly when I saw that other PT fans had purchased this disk. It's pretty good if you are looking for a long sermon put to music."
4,Another masterpiece???..well ....almost,"First let me say that i believe that Neal Morse is a true musical genius. I love everything he does. I just received ? yesterday and have listened to it about 10 times already. Although i love this cd, i cant really call this a masterpiece, nor his best work yet.I feel that some of the jams,especially the part with jordan rudess, are a little over the top,almost to the point of being obnoxious. I also feel that the lyrics are kind of buried in the mix a little,making it hard to hear what God has laid on neal's heart to share with rest of us.There is a very important message in the lyrics on this cd.This is a great album....but, i dont think he can top the ONE CD.A cd like ONE only comes once in a lifetime.you will not be disappointed by ? There is an answer for you in ? GET IT TODAY !!!! YOU'LL LOVE IT"
3,Hearable Christian Rock,"Only reason I listened to his album is because it has good production value, and some surprising twists and turns and the melodies. Otherwise, it's all christian stuff...if u can get over this, well, enjoy."
2,Flimsy,"Although the ring is very nice looking it bent easily. Maybe I don't know enough about metals or silver in particular to know what kind of durability to expect, but this ring was really soft, almost like pewter. It just didn't have the quality I was expecting."
2,"An expert book, but sold by encouraging selfishness and panic","My mother asked me to buy this book for her, and she has not slept since and I wish I read it first. She is upset because bird flu is a worrying possibility, yes, but also because this book writes about it in a way that is designed to make you think, o dear what if the neighbors infect me? how would i save myself, if other people were suffering? It is a bad state of mind, to think of your self when the whole community is badly sick. This book remind me of those men who go to remote deserts and dig fallout shelters and hide there with guns and canned soup. It sounds too excited about the possibility of everybody else dying and being horribly dangerous to you like a zombie film, even though it is written by doctors who should be wise and not selling to people's selfishness and fear. My mother keeps crying in the night and she needs comfort and shame on them."
1,some stories are nice...,"Before going to Tybee Island, I wanted to read the book. Some stories are nice but most of them are very boring. Also the Breakfast Club (mentioned in the book as the author's favorite place) was very disappointng, expensive and greasy.....Save your money for something else!"
3,Good but not great,"I bought this book because I had begun reading the other items in the ""Fantasy Island"" series, and while this one passed the time sufficiently, it seemed a little over done. The characters go a little too far in denying their feelings for each other and drag the story out longer than needed. Still a simple sensual romance that is part of a greater series."
2,The Bill Maher of Anthropology Textbooks,"My cultural anthropology professor assigned this as a textbook at the beginning of the semester, and I can say without hyperbole that this is the most biased textbook I have ever encountered in my life. The definitions in this textbook have an unmitigated liberal bias which for me, as a liberal, are pretty hard to stomach. The authors completely ignore any compulsion for objectivity in this text, the reading of which leaves one feeling like they just got slapped in the face by Bill Maher. Just a warning: political and fiscal conservatives may have a very hard time wading through much of the content of this book, as it is concerned only with presenting the deep liberal bias of its authors. This should not be used as a classroom text, and if it is presented as such, I recommend asking your professor to use something a little less politically charged."
1,Anthropology Unbound,"I've been reading this book for about two months now, probably finished half if it, and I am not impressed. Throughout the book I find extreme bias that is unsupported by evidence. The authors continually make claims against all forms of government using small tribes as evidence that all people should be free of enforced law. I find the book extremely aggravating to read, especially when it tells me that I am brainwashed because governments have been doing so using the internet among other things since prehistoric times. (Yes that is in there (ch10) I find something ridiculous on about every page."
4,Great bang for the buck,"I bought this 2-man tent to use while backpacking.It sets up in a hurry, is very durable, and is very light for a 2-man tent.I generally backpack with one of my kids, and this will hold two of us, plus a change of clothes and our small gear with no problem. There are two doors, which is great, so that we don't have to climb over each other to get out of the tent. Outside each door is a small vestibule, which is a great place to put your shoes to keep them dry. The tent poles (2) are aluminum, and they are very strong and light. I also like the fact that this tent is free standing. Once you get it set up, you can move it around easily if you're not happy with the location.This is a great backpacking tent for the money. It will hold two people with just a few things comfortably, or one person with all your gear comfortably. There are lighter tents out there, but you'll pay for them."
3,Buy some seam sealer,"PROS: Price, lightweight, compact, easy to assemble, good ventilationCONS: Not water resistant, much smaller than advertisedI bought this tent for a recent backpacking trip in the Cohutta Wilderness near the base of the AT. On a 3-day trip, it rained 2.86 inches. Granted, it was a lot of rain, but water came right in through the corners and the base of the doors. My gear was soaked after the first night.Also, I'm 6'5"" tall. The base of this tent is not 7'5"" long as depicted. Just like every other tent on the market, I have to sleep diagonal or have my head and feet jut out the ends of the tent.I just finished sealing all the seams, so I'm willing to give this thing another try. Overall though, I'm a little disappointed."
2,There's no free lunch...,"These were incredibly inexpensive pliers. They look and feel great, but the metal quality is not up to par. It didn't take long for the serrations on the jaws to mush into rounded bumps. Conclusion: These are great to throw in the car trunk, but for real use, buy American."
4,"Good Quality, great value","I have seen similar items at the local hardware storethat are at least twice the cost, and poorer quality.Well made.I could use some of the pliers to be a bit bigger - like theside cutters, so only 4 stars - but they all seem towork well - like a tool should - but usually not at such a great price. Great value item."
2,Good price and that's were it stops...,"The price was right but the product was poor. Undersized tools with poor operation. The first time the channel locks were tested, they failed miserably. With the slightest amount of torque, they slipped open to the next setting. After a bloody knuckle and a few words they were out of my tool box... Sorry for the bad review but it's frustrated to by tools that don't hold up."
4,Decent Set of Tools,"Surprisingly solid. I bought this as a bundled pkg with Johnson 9"" Magnetic Aluminum Level and the Sheffield Folding Lock Back Utility Knife. As the whole pkg was only $14 (w/ free shipping), I figured the tools would be cheaply made. I was wrong. The plier handles are made of hardened plastic and the pliers themselves have smooth movements. I would recommend these tools."
2,Dumbest heater around,"It heats a small sized room, but it can't decide what the temperature is. If you set a low or mid temperature it will reach that temp and shut off. So it goes into a stupid cycle where it turns on for 10 seconds and then turns off. When it tries to turn on it has a lot of fake outs. As soon as it tries to turn on the temp is reached and it shuts off. Instead they should've put a timer that if the heater is turned on by the temp dropping it should at least run for 5 minutes before it turns off no matter if the temp rises above the setting. It should also make sure it doesn't turn back on in less than a minute after it has been turned off by reaching the temp. This would avoid the fake outs and not be so annoying.I like the heater design and how the heater itself doesn't get hot. Also I like the fan which better circulates the air. That is why I give it 2 stars. It is a little loud. If only it would be less annoying by being smart about when to start and stop as stated above."
2,Feel like bashing it with a hammer until it is in little pieces,"The first four months this heater worked great - none of that switching on and off, just steady heat as long as I wanted it. Now it is useless or at least the thermostat is. When I first switch it on it will work for a few minutes, then it will switch on and off every second, sometimes 50 or more times in a row (I lost count). It will make a starting sound like its going to go and then switch off immediately, then start again and stutter again. If I am very lucky it will stay on for 10 seconds. So basically I'll get 5 minutes of heat and then it stutters on and off for the next half an hour, until I switch it off in frustration. Money well spent!"
5,Creative Eating / Creative Writing,"You think you've got a buddy with great hunting/fishing stories? Steven Rinella knows how to hunt and fish AND tell stories. And to make it all more interesting, he attempts to follow challenging, age-old recipes from one of the greatest: Auguste Escoffier (""Le Guide Culinaire""). It makes sense, too, because as a hunter and gatherer he can assemble much more exotic ingredients than you and I could shopping the aisles of the wal-mart produce section. It sounds easy, but just sit down and read this if you appreciate the art of the cooking experience and thrill of the gathering adventure. In fact, I wondered at times whether Rinella would pull off his big meal or not. No, this book is not a detail writing on the fine art of French dining. But in the end, this book is about the process, and learning how to appreciate the end result with family and friends."
4,A DIY geek's introduction to hunting and cooking.,"I don't read outdoor books, and am only mildly interested in food writing, but I really admire renegade DIY personalities. This book is all about people doing things their own way. From the author to the crazy characters he encounters, this book will inspire you to think about doing things yourself rather than having them done for you. Which is an interesting way of life, to say the least. Maybe I won't build an eel weir anytime soon, but I'm glad to have read about somebody who did."
1,"If you're looking for stories about food and cooking, don't get this book","90% of this book is spent dealing with hiking and fishing and hunting, and very little to do with the actual food--the last ten to twenty pages or so. I suppose that it could be amusing at times but to have the book promoted as food related is tenuous at best. If you are looking for stories about food and cooking, look elsewhere. All in all I found it a disappointing book."
1,The Scavengers Guide to Haute Cuisine,"Steven Rinella, big game hunter of sparrows and squirrels, doesn't know the first thing about the value of wildlife to human well being. Wild birds eat insects, including mosquitoes. Squirrels bury acorns and thus spread oak trees across the landscape, providing food for more wildlife. During the reign of Chairman Mao, the Chinese tried to eradicate small birds, believing they were pests. Instead, they discovered that they were critically important predators of crop pests. If we continue to disregard the value of wildlife, as Rinella does out of ignorance, we do so at our peril.He is the real backyard pest and should be ignored, both for his advocacy of destroying wildlife and his claims to haute cuisine.Eric Chivian M.D.DirectorCenter for Health and the Global EnvironmentHarvard Medical School"
1,If you have XP - DONT BUY,"This game is made for older OS's and it will NOT work with XP or newer OS's. The DX build is configured off of very old drivers, hence once installed, it will not run and gives an error message. I tried to update to the latest patch and it still didn't work. Too bad, I was hoping to have some fun with it."
3,Great system but you may not want to buy it here,"I agree with the previous review in terms of quality of system, but beware the exorbitant shipping cost if you buy this item here! Hence the 3 stars."
3,thought this was the movie,It is how they made the movie and their struggle to get it out. I guess it may help those hoping to do the same thing.
2,Not What I Expected,"I learned of the subject matter through my brother, who advised me that I ""had to"" learn about this information. I went to Amazon to buy the book, admittedly not scanning the reviews first. Big mistake. This book involves a behind the scenes at the ""making of"" the documentary film. It does not discuss with any great detail the issues or criticisms of Walmart, which is what I was really looking to know. As anxious as I was to receive and read the book, I am disappointed now. If anyone is interested in these issues, it would be my advice to get and watch the film---do not buy this book."
3,Worth the effort.,"This book has some beautiful prayers and invocations. However, to get to them you have to have patience because it's filled with incredibly long run-on sentences, there is not much rythme or reason to the layout of the chapters and sometimes it's hard to follow the authors line of thinking."
2,An Unfocused Disappointment,"After reading Beth's other book, which was excellent, and a reccomendation from a Wiccan pen pal, I started this book with high expectations. However, I was soon disappointed. While Beth does a good job of explaining the role and necessity of the Dark Goddess (Crone) and relates various goddesses to Her, I found some of these comparisons to be questionable. Also, this book is unfocused, trying to be about the Crone, reincarnation and Atlantis in the same volume with little logical connection. The dissertations of Atlantis were mostly boring and seemed to go on and on. Her past life memories were interesting and entertaining at times, but could have been better connected to the theme of the book. I disagree with her assertion that we repeat the same life purpose and gender in our incarnations. If we don't have different experiences, how can we learn and grow? Overall, this book was a disappointment and I would not recommend it."
3,Bionaire Ceramic Heater,"We bought 2 of these ceramic heaters; 1 is perfect and works well, the other 1 has made noise since we got it (although it does heat well) and when we called Bionaire to try to get it repaired or replaced, we were told we couldn't do so. We don't think we'd buy these heaters again for that reason, although they do work pretty well. We don't feel the customer service and followup is good on these products."
1,Horrible Horrible Horrible!.,"This heater is INCREDIBLY LOUD, even if you set it to the lowest setting, it makes no difference. I bought one these heaters for my parents and they did not even want it because of the superfluous noise and it's poor quality. It takes hours to warm up an enclosed bedroom and it dispenses heat unevenly. You're better off with a basic heater or no heater at all."
1,quite suddenly and could smell smoke,"since i got this for a gift and it suddenly started smelling like and smoke and quit working, does anyone know what retailer carried it so I can return it?"
2,EHHHHH!! it's ok.,"When I first got this heater, I thought it was pretty good. A 4 stars because it was a little bit noisier than I expected but that's just how most portable heaters are. 2 months later I noticed that there is this annoying whirring/clicking noise that sounds like something came loose within the machine itself. It's definitely very annoying and something probably is loose inside the machine. I am going to bring the heater back to costco and try to exchange it for a new one. WIsh me luck cuz i don't have the receipt."
5,Don't overpay !!!!,I just bought this heater from costcco for $45 compared to $80 here..... i haven't taken it out of the box yet but i already love it !!
4,very good,this book is great. i loved it and loved the chacters in too bad it was so short. i am hoping for a sqeul
2,Johnny B,"when you sell a smooth-face framing hammer, you ought to put ""SMOOTH FACE"" in capitals. Most framing hammers have waffles. Guess we'll use it for something else."
4,"Seems to work, but only spoke on test","It installs easily and is very loud. It went off once or twice for a fairly good reason, but it didn't speak either time."
4,Kidde Carbon Monoxide and Smoke Alarm,Item appears to work as expected. I haven't owned it long enough to know about battery life. Fairly easy to install.
4,Carbon Monoxide/Smoke Alarm,"The alarm arrived in a timely fashion and was fully functioning when I received it. The voice is clear, at least for the smoke detector portion. I have not heard the alarm for carbon monoxide."
1,Waste of money,"What a shame. I've had Kidde products before, and I trusted the name. Big mistake. I live in an apartment, and even a very small amount of smoke from the kitchen (say, roasting a chicken in the oven) will cause this alarm to go off, even though it's around the corner at the end of a hallway and I routinely have windows open with excellent cross ventilation. And I'm not talking about smoke that you can see, either. Just a small amount in the air. And then there's that d**ned voice (yes, this model has a voice as well as a beep). I have to reach up, take it down, shut it off, and set it in a window. Every time. It's too sensitive. I won't buy a Kidde product again."
4,WORK WELL,I'm the manager of a high rise building which has 160 apartments the combination carbon & smoke alarm happen to be the best for my building.
3,2 chirping episodes in the first 2 months,"I installed this alarm in my master bedroom two months ago, and I have already encountered the low battery chirping twice. Obviously, I put in a fresh set of batteries when I originally installed it, and both times to silence the chirps I pulled the batteries out, popped the same ones back in, and hit the reset button. I find this obnoxious and will be shopping for an alternative."
3,not for interconnected detectors,"i have a 6 zone interconnected system that runs on ac and uses the battery in smoke detector as backup, meaning it runs on ac current and if the ie: garage zone goes off it will trip all detectors to alarm mode. i typed in the model# off old detector and this one came up so without examining specs carefully i ordered this one, however this one will not work in a interconnected system it is a stand alone smoke detector. use the model that has IB listed after model # if you have interconnected system."
1,DANGEROUS! Fails to detect smoke,"Due to a kitchen mistake, the room this was in filled with smoke. Smoke detector never went off. Figuring it must be out of batteries or something, I hit the test button. It speaks its warnings indicating that it is operating just fine, so it thinks. I even held a smoldering piece of paper right under it. No smoke alarm.Dangerous. Do not buy."
5,Great Service,"I have been very pleased with the three of these that I bought but one of them started beeping every 30 seconds or so. I tried thee sets of batteries but after about 15 minutes, the beeping would start again. I called Kidde and after asking a few questions and having me try a few things, the customer service rep said that they would replace it and it should arrive with a week to ten days. I had it within that time and it works perfectly, I am very pleased with Kidde products and customer service."
5,works,it works fine. not much else to say. i have to write 18 words which is strange- it works. it works.
5,Highly recommend this dual detector,"Very easy set up...Tested out & I love the fact this detects smoke & monoxide.I don't no for sure if monoxide works other than voice activating tests,I did physically tested smoke, and this picks up great. I love the fact thiscan distinguish between them both.... & also lets you know. I highly recommend this."
3,CO/Smoke alarm not for RV,"I purchased this product, intending to install in my RV. Only after opening the package did I discover the information that it is not recommended for an RV. Since it was already opened, I couldn't return it, so now have an extra on my house. Otherwise, seems to be an o.k. sort of alarm."
1,Terrible battery life,"I bought this smoke detector almost exactly a year ago. It seemed like the batteries ran out pretty quickly--we've had to change the batteries a couple of times already. The last time we had to change the batteries, I decided to write down the date. Today I got another low battery warning. I checked the date, and the last time we changed the batteries was November 23--one week ago. Ridiculous. The product is still under warranty, but Kidde requires the consumer to pay shipping both ways. The fact that this product is so faulty is particularly scary considering that people rely on smoke detectors to save lives. I don't trust this product at all and will replace it with a different brand."
3,Smoke filled house,"one day last week was cooking and apprently the house was filled with smoke and realized this after the detector went off,seems it took a very long time to pick up this condition,would say the house was filled with smoke for 5 minutes already,will change the batteries now because its been approx 1 year although manufacture says a voice audio will state low battery power ? anyone have similar experience ?"
5,Excellent product!,"When I read the reviews I knew this was the unit we needed in our home! I have purchased 2 so far. Thankfully we have had no need to ""use"" them yet, but I am comforted by the thought of how well they work!"
4,Works Fine,I bought two of these units to replace two old units about three months ago. These units act independently (not in a linked configuration).They installed reasonably easily. I had to replace the existing harnesses since they weren't compatible.I have not had any false alarms on either unit.
2,ALARM HORN NOT LOUD ENOUGH!,"I purchased this unit for my basement, where my furnace is, and the horn is not loud enough to hear on the 2nd floor. I subsequently bought First Alert units, and the volume of the horn is much better, and satisfactory. In addition, the First Alert units can be linked, so if one alarm sounds, they all sound."
3,Carbon Monoxide Detect,It is very useful in my home to ward off carbon monoxide in my household every day. I have one in my apartment.
2,smoke detector,"It's very good- EXCEPT there is NO volume control- and is WAAAAAY to loud! I think the sensitivity of detecting is also way to high- example- in winter, had my furnace on- was roasting a Turkey- and had 4 burners of stuff simmering-on top of stove- the resulting steam caused the alarm to go off! Frustrating and embarrasing-as NOTHING was burning! I have removed the detector to a far back bedroom. Where it isn't doing me any good."
4,still working,"It has not emitted any weird beeps and it is still working months later, unlike others I've purchased. Seems fine."
3,It does what it does,"...that is it has a 5yr warranty and a 7yr life expectancy and mine went out in the 8th year. So be prepared to re-purchase when the sensors fail and you get the 30-sec loud shrill beep that won't quit even with new batteries. So the manufacturer, Kidde, is willing to give me a 20% discount off of $40 with free shipping--still higher priced than amazon even with Kidde's discount. So the noise won't quit. I'm going around the house trying to locate this loud shrill beep that starts again and again, every 30 sec. Which one is it? Sooner or later you'll find the one that is bad."
1,Do you like paying for an electrician? Then buy Kidde products.,"I've had the Kidde combination smoke and carbon monoxide alarm installed for three years and have paid $300 in electrician bills to install and fix them. Tomorrow morning I will pay again because the things wont stop chirping again.The chirping is not caused by the battery. All the wire-in units have been reset. This is not the first time this is happened or that the units have alarmed because of a malfunction. Last time the units were still under waranty and Kidde replaced one. (Kidde didn't offer to pay for both visits by electricians.) Tomorrow morning I will pay another electricial but this time to unistall all of the units. I'm going back to the simpler battery-opperated ones (not by Kidde). I will never buy another Kidde product.Oh, and forget any trouble-shooting help from the manual or the KiddeUs.com site. I found no help for this either place."
1,Did not pick up Carbon Monoxide.,"My husband and I smelled a strange smell every time we used our oven. We were not alarmed because our carbon monoxide detector did not go off. But we have two small kids, and decided to call in Nicor anyways just to be safe. Our oven was seriously spewing out carbon monoxide every time it was on. And the detector did not go off. We are replacing it with another brand immediately."
5,Perfect,Reasonably priced for the required CO smoke detector required by code in our location. Have had this for two years now and have had no problems
1,Base Won't Fit,"The base of the unit will not fit easily to the body. Once you manage to put it on, it's just about impossible to take it off. You can try twisting all day long until your hands are raw, it won't budge until the tabs break. Piece of junk."
5,Combo Smoke Alarm sensor.,Required by law in California now. So it was a great price. It works well with gas wall heaters. Easy to install.
3,"It works OK, but ...","I have given this only 3 stars because we got a defective one :-( After a couple of months it started alarming for carbon monoxide while every other CO monitor in the house said there was no problem ... Of course it only did this in the middle of the night :-( I would give Kidde customer service 5 stars, as they replaced it ""No questions asked"", and the new one hasn't gone off in the night (yet !)."
4,Smoke and CO detector,"I bought two of these. One of them was apparantly defective (started chirping every 30 seconds the first day). I called the Kidde number on the detector, and they sent me a new replacement within a week for no charge. They are both working currently."
5,Ultimate Safety First!,"After someone explained to me that ""beeping"" noises of smoke alarms do not always wake people (especially children), I looked into this `talking alarm'. It is amazing. Instead of that annoying `beep-beep', you hear either a vocal, ""Fire! Fire!"" or ""Carbon Monoxide!"". Not all smoke alarms will detect carbon monoxide and any firefighter, policeman or paramedic will tell you that carbon monoxide can be just as deadly. Plus, this kit comes with batteries and a DVD that shows firefighters in action. This is the kind of protection every family needs and at the price, it can't be beat. You can easily test it weekly and a small green light will tell you if the batteries are functional (you should change them every year anyway). When the batteries are low, the red light flashes and a voice warns you along with a 'chirp'. This is a no-brainer!"
2,Hope you like changing batteries often!,"This alarm works great, but it goes through batteries like crazy -- and somehow it always seems to happen in the middle of the night when you're trying to sleep. But really, if it's convenient for you to reach then changing the batteries often will be no problem. Otherwise, look for something that has a longer battery life."
5,Great Buy,I needed 4 CO detectors for my 4 family house that's a rental owned by my brother and I. These detectors meet NYC Housing code for existing buildings. The price I paid is hard to beat and Kidde alarms are of good quality.
4,"No false alarms, peace of mind in case of fire or carbon monoxide","Most smoke alarms only cover smoke, this one also covers deadly carbon monoxide which you can't smellInstallation is easy, just remove your old smoke alarm and put up two screws to mountThis takes 3 AAA batteries vs. the 9V D cell of oldWhen you press the test button, it talks to you to alert you of fire or carbon monoxide warning vs. high pitch squeal of oldIt also has warning leds, and will let you know if batteries are lowIt works, does the job, you shouldn't hear unless you have an emergencyLittle pricey, hence 4 starsNormally you should change yours every 5 years to be on the safe side"
5,Kidde Model KN-COSMXTR-B Smoke/Fire and Carbon Dioxide Detector Very Predictable,I have three of these units in my house. I replaced them right at 7 years when the CO sensor failed as predicted. I like the units because they keep you reminded to change batteries and tell you when they need to be replaced.
3,the carbon monoxide detector does not work,"Smoke detector works, but the carbon monoxide detector probe and what does not work and I tested a lot and did not work, sorry for that I really like this alarm but just thank you very much amazon"
4,Replacment,"Nice little voice activation for checking accuracy, and telling you if there is any problem. I like this feature very much. I would recommend this product it has been reliable for me as I am a Landlord using these for Unit."
3,Arrived with factory defect,"This product was ordered to replace an identical make and model that gave up the ghost after 7 years. When it arrived, the base would not twist off of the smoke alarm. Finally had to force it off. There was no getting the alarm back onto the base that came with it, so I would have been in big trouble if I didn't have the non-defective base from the previous alarm to use."
5,smoke & co2 combo alarm,i had similar item before but this one is much better as it has voice notification making it dummy proof. good price for combo model compared to items at Target / Walmart / Home Depot.keep it up.
5,A must for everyone,Sorry we didn't buy more at the time. I should have bought some for gifts. It is a great smoke and carbon monoxide alarm and it talks.
4,smoke/co2 detector,it appears to be working as advertised. I now know that it has a lifespan of 7 years. I called Kidde customer service re the model that I owned. It started beeping 7 years and 2 months after purchase. This info is buried in the bowels of the documentation. Purchased the same model that I previouslyowned.
3,Great Product - Poor Battery Life,I have had this in my house for a month now and have had to change batteries twice already. To the reviewer who speaks of 6 mos according to the product manual - Wait a little while after you buy a product to give it a review.
1,Three of Three Detectors Malfunctioned,"I bought 3 of these from Home Depot immediately after closing on our home. Within one month they began to malfunction. Every 15 minutes or so they began to output a loud beep, and repeat this behavior for about an hour before going silent. Once quite they would remain dorment for days on end before repeating this behavior. The sticker on the detector says that this behavior is signaling that the detector has malfunctioned. Being an optimist I tried swapping out the batteries hoping that would put an end to it; unfortunately it didn't help in the slightest. The last straw was when the detectors startled us awake at 3:00 AM for the 3rd or 4th time. They all came down that night. We will never buy another Kidde detector."
3,50/50,"I purchased my two units in 2009. One works fine. The other started to beep every 30 seconds, which means unit malfunction. The warranty is 5 years but the price of boxing it up and shipping it to the factory in North Carolina (and return shipping another to us, as I understand it) will cost as much as buying new, just about. I like the new price so I'll purchase another. Otherwise, the device works fine; even went off when I was burning my dinner on the stove one night."
4,Kidde Alarm - CO and Smoke,"The only reason I gave this 4 and not 5 stars is that the alarm has not been given the ultimate test, and I hope it never will. Other reviews of this product, especially one where the alarm did perform in a real-life situation, persuaded me to buy. It was well priced, easy to install n my travel trailer, and tested just fine."
1,Don't waste your money on this one,"This Kidde CO & smoke alarm combination did not perform to our expectations. It constantly beeps for no apparent reason, chosing to do so in the night time more often than not. I wouldn't waste my money on one of these. I bought a First Alert at the same time as I bought this one and it has been excellent; no problems."
4,"This is our second one, we love.",This is one of the best quality detector and we replaced a former old one with the same brand as it remains the best one out there. The alarm is loud and the fire fire alert is clear! We end uP settings it off with my cooking! We Liebig that it has he combo carbon monoxide with it too. Great value and great quality.
2,It's battery changing time!,"This seems like it's probably OK at what it does, but I have to change the batteries every 5-6 weeks. That's really not acceptable.I'm not sure if it's easier to switch to lithiums than to throw this out-- maybe I can get 6 months out of lithiums. That will be about $11 per year to run this. Oy.P.S. to all those internet geniuses who reflexively tell people to get better batteries: my batteries are rated above-average for alkalines by Consumers Reports. So save it."
1,Horrible Alarm,"One week after installing them, a 30 second chirping noise started, then I replace the battery and the same issue. Annoying chirping every 30 seconds. I checked the manufactured date and it was Feb 2010, so it was recent. Called the number and it was useless. So, I ended up with two alarms that do not do anything for me other than chirping every 30 sec. I lost receipt to return them. Learn from my experience those alarms are horrible."
1,DO NOT BUY,"Carbon Monoxide detector has a tendency to go off for no reason whatsoever. The first time it happened, I thought it was a fluke. Then 2 weeks later I get a call at work from my super saying that my smoke alarm is going off in my apartment and he thinks there is a fire. Long story short I race home to find....nothing. This thing is absolute junk, buy from any other company."
1,Overly sensitive!! Do not install in any room adjacent to a kitchen,"This alarm is way too sensitive. It goes off every time we pull bacon out if the oven, doesn't even take things to burn before it goes off. If you can't cook anything greasy ever, why have the alarm installed? Rip out! And get a less sensitive model, because I don't need a smoke alarm to tell me when my bacon is done."
3,Maybe it works - Maybe it doesn't,Installed it and tested it with the tester button.No way to be sure it works unless we have a carbon monoxide problem. Which I never have had in the 25 years I have been using these sensors.But I sleep better at night knowing it is installed...
5,"Annoying, but in a good way.",This alarm is very sensitive(and has brought my attention to the fact that I'm a much worse cook than I thought)but that's what you want in a smoke alarm. The hush feature is nice and simple.
1,Poor Carbon Monoxide Detection,"I have had one of these units in my furnace room mounted on the ceiling for over a year now. During a furnace repair, I discovered that the entire back half of my furnace exhaust pipe had rusted away and the furnace had been pumping exhaust directly into my basement all winter. Even though the detector was located only 5 feet away from the furnace and still responds correctly when the test button is pushed, it NEVER detected carbon monoxide. It is possible that the exhaust was being dispersed in a large basement area, but the detector still should have warned me. I have lost all confidence in this device."
2,Date Of Manufacture is VERY Important!!,Amazon does not provide the date of manufacture for this (and similar) items. A CO detector is typically good for 7 years before it starts beeping as an indicator to be taken out of service. We just replaced a CO detector in our home recently and upon opening it found it was manufactured in Aug of 2007. This does not leave much operating life left in my home for the money. Buyer beware as these are important and expensive life savers in your home to keep replacing every few years. Worth buying in person to check the date of manufacture.
5,My Kids Respond..that's all that matters,"We couldn't get our kids to wake up to a standard fire alarm and that was extremely troubling. We tried this model out and with the talking alarm, they heard it and were able to get out of the house when we did a firedrill. Scares me to think of what could have happened with the other models but I have comfort with this in the house. A great solution. Highly recommended."
3,FYI,2nd Alarm my family has owned. Probably wouldn't have purchased again if the price weren't so reasonable due to the fact that the Alarm actually is programmed to fail after 7 years. At which time you have no choice but to purchase a new one. Both of mine failed within a day of each other. I do have peace of mind knowing that I am protected.
4,Smoke Detector,"This smoke detector, the Kidde KN-COSM-B Battery-Operated Combination Carbon Monoxide and Smoke Alarm with Talking Alarm, is replacing the very similar Kidde smoke detector that finally died after many years of faithful service.I thought that I might replace it with a ""First Alert"" alarm, but after reading the reviews it became obvious that I should stick with a sure thing and buy another Kidde alarm. The one I had worked fine over the years and I expect this replacement to do the same.I don't need any false alarms at 2:00AM in the morning or any other time, or setting it off every time I hit a button on any remote control device in the house, or have it malfunction only after a month or two of service and the hassle of sending it back. I am sticking with Kidde and it's proven record.Another nice thing is that the new Kidde fits on the same ceiling mount that the outgoing one did. So I didn't have to redo the mount. I just snapped on the new Kidde and it was done! Life is good!Pete"
4,good purchase,"replaced two separate detectors. works fine Have not used it long enough to see if the quality is there, but it looks and feels like good construction."
4,great product,"voice command, mute feature and price make this a great deal...comparable units cost much more with less features..I highly recommend this item..."
1,Eats batteries!,I bought this talking alarm specifically because I thought it would be easier for us to react to it if it does go off and boy was I right. It has been up for 1 month and has gone off in the middle of the night 5 times for a test and low batteries. This smoke detector has eaten 12 lithium batteries in a month! It is completely ridiculous and is now going in the trash.
4,It works,"It has a dual purpose, and they both work with audio tones and voice ques for those who drown out audio tones. Good product."
3,Seems ok,Seems to work. Installs easily.Need to fill up this box so I can submit. I have not actually tested it beyond the button
3,Amazon sent me a one year old unit.,"I bought this detector on 10/17/10 from Amazon. The unit I received had a manufacturing date of 9/17/09 written on it. Amazon sent me a detector which was over one year old. These detectors have a life span of 5-7 years, so my ""new"" unit is already 20% used up. I hope that it won't have problems after sitting around in the warehouse for 13 months.Other than the manufacture date, this is a decent detector. It replaced an old KN-COSM-B whose batteries corroded and damaged the battery compartment. It's odd that they corroded, but the detector was 6 years old, so I gladly replaced it.Buy your detector from the local hardware store, who may have units which aren't a year old like Amazon."
5,great!,"this item was ok just as I expected I wish you didnt have to comment here on every thing, one two three four five six seven"
3,It is still working,"I bought one this last year from Lowe's. It was out of order June of this year. Then, I bought another one this product from Amazon.com. It is still working now."
4,good product reasonably priced,"This is a good product, easy to install and reasonably priced, will buy it again next time I need a smoke/cm detector."
4,Kidde KN-COSM-B battery carbon monoxide and smoke combo,Very happy with this product. However bought two and one was defective. Had to call manufacturer and have replaced. They did with no problem or cost.
4,Fantastic combo detector,I love this detector. As a combo unit we bought it due to our state requirements and to put outside our daughter's room. This unit is very clear and audible. I can assure you that this works well. The voice alarm leaves no question as to what's going on and what you need to do. The only downside was that I found the bracket to be a bit clumsy comparative to other smoke detectors I have used.
5,Smoke/Carbon Monoxide Detector Tested Good,"I purchased this combination smoke/carbon monoxide detector to replace a single smoke alarm to have a more secure feeling of protection from the odorless carbon monoxide gas as well as fire danger. So far no detected indication of carbon monoxide. I feel confident this unit will perform correctly since every test has indicated it is operating properly. I've tested it every week for a month now.This is a battery (3 AA) operated detector that can be installed just about anywhere. The backplate is also ""holed"" and designed to be mounted to an electrical box.Overall, I am pleased with this purchase and now have a more assured feeling of protection."
3,Not exactly what I wanted,"I was a little disappointed with this because it all comes apart so easily. When you are using it, it is not a problem. But when you want to move it out of the way quickly to do something else, the whole thing comes apart and you have to put it back together. It would be better if it locked in place or something."
2,Not long enough!,"This step is ok for basic low impact aerobics but for some of Cathe's Advanced tapes it doesn't work as well, she uses the bigger step on her harder tapes and some of the moves take up the whole step and I fear that I will step off by accident."
5,Great retrospective of the Kings,"10 Years Deep is a great look at the history of the Kottonmouth Kings from their humble beginnings in P-Town to the present day as one of the best underground groups around along with videos from Fire It Up and some live version of KMK classic Day Dreamin` Fazes and Bump. Plus the bonus material is excellent, especially the DJ Bobby B segment. The only negatives about 10 Years Deep is not enough Saint Dog and leaving out some stuff like Rob Harris being the first KMK DJ. If you`re a devoted Krowner, then it`s a great addition to the KMK DVD collection. However i highly recommend it to anyone that is new to the whole world of Kottonmouth Kings."
5,An excellent book,Man all his life around books sworn I enjoyed every photo in the book.Moves the experience of a man of letters.
3,"Bernstein is great, but the sound...","As with the Unitel videos mostly released on DGG, Bernstein conducts wondeful, emotive performances of these Brahms symphonies. The performances pulls one into them and they are wonderful played by the IPO.The video quality is OK appears to have originated from videotape with noticeable flare on bright images. The sound is a dissapointment to me. It sounds small, closed in with glassy strings even on the DTS track. If you are buying this for the performances go ahead and be confident in your choice. If sound is important, then hope the Unitel has a version of these symphonies with the VPO that they will release in the future."
4,Bernstein's Brahms with Israel Philharmonic,"Excellent video and stereo sound, from performances of 1973. The Israel Philharmonic sounds wonderful and the interpretations are of the mainstream ""Germanic"" style.....powerful, poetic, beautifully played and sometimes a little self-indulgent. Mr. Bernstein's podium antics are sometimes embarassing to watch, and are not models of restraint, but the results (in sound) are enough to outweigh the over-the-top physicality of his conducting."
2,Blades are terribly lopsided.,"I purchased this knife after misplacing last one. It's a nice size, and is very light. It's made by Gerber, not a cheap $5 flea market special, so why are the blades so badly ground? Blade is very lopsided. This issue ruins what is otherwise, a really good knife! How does this get past quality control? This won't do. I sent it right back.I don't blame the seller, but maybe they should pull these out of the box, and look at them before shipping. I didn't order a replacement, but went to Sportsmans Warehouse to inspect before buying...guess what? Out of the three they had only one was acceptable. If Gerber machine grinds these, they'd better recalibrate. If people are doing it by hand, they should be fired.Buyer Beware! The rating for this knife as received is Two stars, but a properly ground one gets a Five."
4,Great value for a quality product,"This knife is slim and compact so it's easy to carry and keep on you without any hassle. At this price, it's probably not going to be the most durable knife if you plan on using it heavily every day but it feels solid enough and just big enough for moderate everyday use around the house or office. I just got it so the jury is still out but I think it's a great choice for this price and seems like a dependable knife around to get some things done."
5,Excellent hand knife !!!,"Have to admit I was wary about purchasing this, but I intend to buy another one! The blade stays sharp, and it's only ""draw back"" is, it's so comfortable to use I sometimes forget it's in my hand! A person at work saw me useing it and made a remark about its size, so I handed it to her and the first thing that was said was ""Oh! This is comfy!"" She then wanted to know where it could be bought...It is one of the best knives I have ever owned...Pure quality! A few of the guys appreciated its' size and sharpness...very light weight, fits in any pocket!"
5,Gerber LST,"The Gerber LST is an amazing knife for the money. I have used them for years. Light, well made and inexpensive."
5,"Gerber 22-06009 L S T Drop Pt, Fine pt knife","Excellent service, quick easy. The knife replaced a knife I lost after carrying it for 20 yrs. This knife is just the right size and weight for a pocket knife, edge is sharp and stays sharp. I am very pleased with this knife."
5,great knife,"This is a great everyday knife. Sure, it's not as heavy duty as some people might like (the blade is quite thin), but for an everyday knife to have in your pocket, it fits the bill perfectly. It's extremely light (you will only barely notice that something is in your pocket), very sharp, and very well-balanced in your hand. It's an ideal blade for slicing things. The only bad thing I have to say is that it doesn't come with a pocket clip.I highly recommend owning one of these, but don't pay more than $15-$16."
4,Great photo album,My son is 9 years old now and I have been looking for a good photo album for his baby pictures. This album is great!! I love the space near the pictures to write favorite moments.
5,Amazing Book,"My 3 1/2 year old son loves this book! I'm forced to read it to him every day, and he now tells me: 1. ""Lymphocytes are the smartest cells and make antibodies that knock out the germs...I want to be an antibody!"" 2.""Macrophages are garbage collectors"" 3. ""Virus turn my cells into virus machines"" 4. ""Fibroblasts pull my cut together""He is still a little confused about the whole ""blast"" part of the fibroblast...thinking that they should somehow makes something explode..."
1,A career finished in crisis,"I find it hardly surprising that nobody to date has reviewed this record. Gary Glitter was probably at his peak in the mid 70s, his glam rock music was always hitting the mainstream UK charts with a measurable amount of success. Now though, for how he has been portrayed following convictions for downloading child pornography and allegations of child rape, his career is to coin a phrase, finished. I also noted not long ago at a local club when they put a Glitter song on and everybody walked off the dance floor and when you see things like that happen, it makes you wonder whether anybody is buying his records at all now."
5,Excellent video,"Zecharia Sitchin really deserves to be a household name. His theories at a quick glance seem really far fetched , but once he starts backing up his theories (which he does) the man shows himself to be a genius. There is no other human that can decipher & educate people honestly about ancient Sumeria & the Sumerian texts as well as he does . He is not afraid to shock mainstream science. In the not to far off future , I'm sure his theories will be more widely accepted by mainstream science. A must own video for all. It could have been produced a bit better but that will not stop me from giving him 5 stars. My only complaint is I did not want the video to end . He's a fascinating man with fascinating theories. If you haven't read this mans books , you are truly missing out on history being re-written."
1,Marketing Tool,"This is simply a marketing tool for the MLM ""Young Living Essential Oils"" and most of the positive reviews here from probably written by shills of the company. If you buy this book, simply be aware that it is intended to steer you to their products and not give a truly unbiased view of this science. Contrary to loyal customers of this company, there are other places to get quality essential oils - don't be fooled by their rhetoric.Essential oils may be useful, and I am not playing down their potential - I am simply against this book serving any useful, unbiased purpose in educating people about essential oils."
2,Not as good as it looks,The book should cost not more then $20 based on the information contained. Much of the information is either watered down or appears in his first book. Needless to say I was not impressed with the book.
2,Another one idea book.,"The writing is mediocre. The book swings between absolutely fluffy anecdotes and inadequately explained scientific techniques. I think he is totally underestimating the readers intelligence. May not be the author's idea to dumb it down this much. I'm trying to get into it, but it's difficult. Richard Wiseman might be a better read if you're looking for something in a similar vein."
4,Take this book with in long travels!,"Not being a specialists in brain sciences, reading these lenghty stories about our brain might need some incentives. In connection with pleasant things like happiness, pleasure, satisfaction etc. reading about our brain is now easier than along gloomy, sad, mad and bad things ... the later ones are not entangled in the book. The stories (or quasi-essays) got anyway thinner due to the view kept constantly open towards the basics of physical and chemical brain functions.Psychological cultivations on happiness and related subjects must mainly be sought elsewhere."
1,cheap bag,"cheap bag. it fell apart literally after 2 weeks of usage. First it started with the threat then the zipper got stuck. then i started to use it as blanket and then i realized it was falling a part at then and there was a hole. The next thing I knew I felt some cotton. And when I woke up one morning I take a look, the cotton was all over my bed because the bag fell a part cuz of loosen threats/stitches. I bought two of these and they both fell apart."
2,Great microwave...while it works,"Absolutely loved this product...for the first 50 days. Then it died. I called Haier to find a local service center and was told they don't do repairs on this. So if I send in the receipt, cut off the power cord, take a blow dryer and remove the label on the back, along with a check for $15 via registered mail, they will send a replacement in 3 weeks.As if it wasn't bad enough having the unit not even last 60 days, now I have to jump through all these hoops. And pay for the pleasure of doing so. Oh, and wait 3 weeks for a replacement, which means I have to go out and buy something in the meantime anyway.The microwave is great, when it works. But Haier has a lot to learn about standing behind its products."
2,Most disappointing knife I own,"This knife looked like it would be a winner, so I bought one for myself, and one for my Dad. I'm VERY disapointed. It doesn't hold an edge, the steel is horrid. I carried it every day for a month or so, and went back to my previous knife (Kershaw DWO)Disclaimer - I'm a bit of a knife nut, and have a LOT of pocket knives, so I'm quite picky, and I'm willing to spend for a knife"
4,Wow - really small!,"Wow, this knife is a *lot* smaller than I thought it would be. I used to have a larger one which looked exactly the same, so I eagerly ordered this one (without reading how long the blade is - oops) and was a bit disappointed to see how tiny it is. I guess this knife would be good on a keychain, but it's so small that it's hard to hold and it seems that it might be easy to cut yourself on it. Still, seems well made, and if you're looking for a *tiny* knife, this is it."
2,Syntax & Semantic Reference Guide,"This book should be called the ""Syntax & Semantic Reference Guide for Common Lisp"". It is not a primer on Common Lisp; for the most part the author spews information about the specification (which he was part of forming). This might be the best reference book on Lisp ever written, but don't attempt to try and learn the Lisp language from this text."
4,Still a great reference,"While you can use the online ANSI HyperSpec, there are still several Common Lisps which are not fully conformant, and used CLtL/2 as their base. For these Lisps, this book is a must.In general, I think this book makes a much better reference than the HyperSpec, and I don't think any other book I've seen can compare. GLS is a terrific writer - very clear with a dry sense of humor that pervades the book, and has a number of useful examples. While there are many parts of Common Lisp that can be difficult to comprehend at first glance (e.g., backquotes) GLS's presentation brings a clarity to the effort that makes it a pleasure to read (and in the case of FORMAT, read again and again! ;-)Read the index carefully for additional humor! END"
3,NOT a third edition,"If you own the second edition, published by 2.13.61 in the mid-90s, be aware that this is an exact reprint. I believe the only new material is a 1.5-page preface, and there is a different cover design (the new art is a painting based on the photo on the cover of the second edition). Redoubt misleads in calling this a 3rd edition. Unless you're sick of dirtying the pages of your second edition and want a brand-new copy, you don't need this. I rate this 5 stars for content and 1 for the false labeling."
4,Excellent quality,It is excellent quality and I believe it will hold up even with two boys playing with them all the time
1,Light,CAN SOMEONE HELP ME! I just got this light for Christmas and when i plugged it in the light did not turn on. The light bulbs were rotating when i plugged it in but no light emitted from it. PLEASE HELP ME IF YOU HAD THIS PROBLEM! or if can anyone give me the address so i can return it because it has a limited one year warranty.
4,Eliminator Asteroid Light,"This product is worth the money ! It is very professional, bright, and fun to own. It colorfully lights up a room as it makes the bright colors twist and rotate to the sound of music."
3,Eliminator,"Strong throw & cool shapes. However, music sensor doesn't work, so nothing moves. Used it 5 hours straight with no fuse/bulb problems."
3,good light,this is not exactly what i expected. it does get the job done but it's extremely fragile. the small tabs on either side have both broken already. one side from being opened and the other from a possible drop. the three led lights are barely brighter than the single light and the normal light dies down pretty fast compared to the other three. all in all it gets the job done.
2,Teach you teens to drive,"I ordered the used version (Book/Video Kit) on amazon.com for the parent taught class and they didn't send the spiral notebook, they only sent the video. Be careful, you get what you pay for."
1,Not a reasonable product to review,"It is small toy size. If you want to keep it with your barbie, it is a nice product"
3,Soft and Cuddly but Toxic.,I got this pillow as a free Amazon gift with purchase. It is a very unique and soft pillow that is comfortable to use. Be careful because the packing inside the pillow is toxic. It might be helpful to note that the warning label on the pillow states that the pillow is decorative and should not be used for sleeping. I would be careful with this one and other Mogu products.
4,Quite shocking.,"The shocking pink is nice and shocking, which I guess is what you're going for if you buy this. It has a great squishy texture and the material feels nice.I guess as a 'decorative' pillow it's not really supposed to be useful, but I like to put it under my head if I'm laying on the floor watching TV."
1,A free piece of junk,Threw it away shortly after I recieved it as a FREE GIFT with some other order.
3,This pillow is fine.,This pillow is just an average everyday run-of-the-mill deal. I got this as a free gift along with something else I ordered from Amazon.
5,I use this ESL book to teach Kreyol at Duke University!,"I realize that this is an ESL text, but I have been using this picture dictionary since fall of 1997 to teach Haitian Kreyol to Medical and Divinity students and faculty at Duke University, as well as to youth and adult groups traveling to Haiti on mission trips. It has proved true that a picture speaks louder than words. The bold graphics make the vocabulary learning a wee bit more exciting than they would working only with text. Also, I appreciate the practical mix of verbs and adjectives, as well as nouns. I recommend it to everyone who is teaching or studying Kreyol, especially beginners."
3,Not sure if this works,I'm always on the lookout for new ways to dry my nail fast. I'm not sure if this really works though. I may make my nails dry to the touch in 2-3 minutes but that's normal with or without this spray. And they don't really make them so hard that they are smudge or nic-proof so not sure if this is worth it...
4,Does the Job,"I had read good reviews of this product, so I decided to try it. It gets the job done, and I'm satisfied. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I had expected the drying time to be a little faster."
5,very good product!,Works very well and cheaper than Sephora dryer!!This is a very good deal from OPI.I use it every time i put on nail polish.
4,I'm pretty happy with thos product:).,"I had a bottle of this years ago and remembered it being a little less oily-feeling, but it does dry really make polish dry fast and it arrived fast from the seller:)."
1,Does not work,"I tried this on numerous types of polish and it didn't work. Polish stayed wet and sticky. Have never found any product that really dries nails fast or even speeds up drying a little. Waste of money, wish I hadn't read other's review and gone with my gut instincts that it wasn't any good."
5,Super Product!!,"I first tried this product when it was given to me as a free sample. I fell in love with it. It's much faster and easier to use than the OPI Rapidry polish. And it actually works. I spray it on about 15 seconds after my second coat of nail polish. In about a minute or two, the tops of my nails are dry enough that the polish won't mess up if I accidentally tap my fingernails against something. It also allows me to get dressed AFTER polishing my nails without ""bunching up"" the polish."
4,Rapid Dry Spray -works Great,"I prefer to do my own nails over going to a salon, this spray works great. I try to polish my nails every weekend in hope they will last during the ""working week"". This spray dries them fast, so I don't get ""Sheet Marks"" on my nail polish. I have used the spray and polish both, but like the spray better since the application is faster and more user friendly. Great product, I recommend it for anyone that likes fast results."
5,nail drier!!!,"Am satisfied with this spray. my nail polish dries in few seconds after spraying this.very good product for nail art.My only concern is with bottle, it is made of some cheap plastic.now i feel like buying drops instead of spray as i feel there is wastage of liquid when we spray. apart from tht it works really gr8!"
4,Great sleeping bag,"Very good bag for spring and summer/early fall camping. It is very soft and comfortable.The reason I give it 4 stars is I find it hard to believe this is a 30 degree bag. I bought a 40 degree bag also from Wenzel at the same time, and the weight and amount infill seems the same in the two. I may be wrong, but the two seem identical except for color (and price).Otherwise, an excellent sleeping bag for light use or for kids."
4,great bag,Lining would be more comfortable in a cotton or flannel. The nylon is a bit icky to sleep on. Overall a great bag and really good for my needs.
2,Cheap design,"We bought two of these for a camping trip and they ripped on the first night. It was pretty a pretty big let down. Luckily we were able to return and get our money refunded without any hassle. Before they ripped, they were very warm and comfortable."
2,Not working out of the box!,"Has great features, however 3 of the 8 switches are not working. Have had similar problems before. Using because I had to, but not happy."
3,Interesting articles,"This is quite a good book filled with a large number of articles about the political freedoms in the USA a year after 9/11.As would be expected with the contributors, there is not a great deal of love to the Bush Administration or its handling of the nation in this time period.The articles (as the editors state) tend to get repetitious after a while, so the second half of the book is more of a speed read in certain sections.I found this book to be thought-provoking."
3,Inconvenient when emitting nuisance alarms,"Although extremely sensitive, it is prone to emit nuisance alarms caused by broiling meat, sawing or painting in a room. For the first, just make sure your kitchen is adequately vented. For the second, make sure your detector has a ""shower cap"" on in while you work. If your detector gets dust in it caused by sawing or spray painting, you will most likely have to replace the detector (according to my electrical contractor).In new construction, detectors are usually connected to one circuit--they are interconnected. When one goes off, they all do. This model does not have a hush button. To shut it (them) off, you either have to fan a magazine under the suspect detector or trip the circuit breaker. This being the case, if you are having new construction, I suggest you connect your several detectors to a dedicated circuit.My recommendation is to buy units with a hush button, connect them to a dedicated circuit breaker, or do both."
1,It won't shut up!,"This alarm does not have a hush feature and it is very sensitive. It has gone off for such things as normal stove top cooking and running the dryer for extended periods. They are all connected so they all go berserk when one goes off. Since they have no hush feature you either have to kill the power or manually run around and remove each one from the wall (there is a socket connection on the back at least).We live in a rental home so we can't get rid of them, otherwise we would."
1,Goes off when it gets cold in the house,"Tomorrow I am going to replace both of my model 1235 units with something else. I have been trying to save money by turning down the heat at night and it seems that sometimes when it gets down aroud 65 degrees it chirps all night long. When I get angry enough to get up and disconnect one, the other one keeps going off. I have had it. Enough is enough."
3,Nothing romantic.,"I hope I never have to find out if this works or not. I got it to replace the last one that I thought was goofy and beeping all the time. Turns out nothing was wrong with the Kidde I had, the beeping was a different alarm altogether, but I found out after I had ordered this new one......so now, I'm one alarm ahead of the game."
3,Great product if we knew how to use it!,"As always, Amazon is amazing when it comes to shipping times and prices. Unfortunately, this manufacturer sucks when it comes to product instructions. What is actually spelled out in English gives no good explanation of how to attach the butane cans: does the can stay attached? Do you just fill the chamber with enough to get your job done? When playing with fire, I'd really like to know before ""winging it"" and losing an eyebrow or two."
3,"Eh, it is what it is.",More complicated than necessary. I bought this because it looked nicer than a multi use torch from Lowe's or Home Depot. I should have gone with useability and not aesthetics.
5,"Just as advertised, so far","Have only used it once, but very happy with its performance while making a creme brulee. Good flame control. Also, looks like it would make an excellent cigar lighter on a breezy deck."
2,we returned it,It burnt everything. Don't laugh. I know it's a torch. But it burnt everything. Even Creme Brulee. I think there was a problem with the fuel regulator or something. I felt like I could have welded steel or something.Maybe my household was never meant to have creme brulee :(
2,A little disappointing,"I purchased this torch to use for Creme Brulee. Mine did not come full of fuel as other reviewers mentioned, so I was glad to have purchased a fuel refill. After filling it, it worked fine on the first ramekin, but continued to go out when I tried to use it on the second ramekin. I repeatedly tried and it just kept going out. I followed the directions and made sure the flame indicator was in the mid-range and even tried adjusting the air valve, but every time I use it, it just sputters out. The fuel indicator shows that it is full. I eventually get the crust I am looking for on the Creme Brulee, but it takes entirely too long."
3,Get the Other One from Bonjour -- It's Better Made,"I've tried these both. This one's not nearly as nice in look and feel as the other one made by the company, which I ultimately decided to buy instead:BonJour Creme Brulee Chef's Professional Culinary Torch with Fuel Gauge. It's literally just a few dollars more but a huge step up in quality and appearance for such a small added investment. It also performs flawlessly, and fuel was easy to obtain at my local Walgreens for $5."
3,Useful with Reservations,"I got this to make Crème brlée and used it so far five times. It does its job, but the biggest problem is to get it to lit. It is very tricky and the first time I used it I thought it was defect because it was so difficult and took a very long time. Since then I gave up using its internal lighter and started to used matches turn it on. While filling it up you have to be careful not to overfill it since the level indicator shows you not right away how much it is filled up. This makes it very easy to overfill it. Finally this size of torch requires a long time to finish a single crème brlée, usually a minute or two, which adds up if you have several ramekins. Next time I would get a stronger torch."
1,"After 2 lights, no go.","I just received this kitchen torch tonight, and after two lights that were pretty powerful, it will not ignite again. Have checked fuel gauge, slid levers in every position, and tried more than 30 times to get it to ignite again and it won't. I am returning this item the day after receiving it and will get another brand."
5,Caramel !,"This culinary torch looks great, and works beautifully. I like the visible levelof fuel, which makes the torch ready for work . It can be used for many dishes, notonly creme brulee : I have caramelized onions on appetizers, apples on tarts, evencheese on soups, it's fun to use, works every time, makes you feel like a chef atthe table ! I don't miss my old one a bit. A great tool for the price !"
4,Flames and Creme Brulee....,"As a toy my wife has wanted for some time but never acquired, this produces adjustable fire on demand (whoo, whoo)in quantity sufficient to put a proper crust on creme brulee, french onion soup or, most recently, roasted salsa (three major food groups). Reasonably solid feeling, and appears on short experience to be enough for a non-pretentious, occasional use, home chef.As others have mentioned, our unit showed up already filled with butane. A couple of minutes with the directions (enough ""push two buttons at once"" to avoid accidental ignition or use by the underaged) and we had a respectable, adjustable blue torch in the kitchen. Operation wasn't intuitive, at least for me, so you may want to rubber band the directions around the handle if your use isn't regular.Short of a really commercial level demand, this unit seems just fine for home use. I suspect it will find things to singe around our kitchen and dining room for some time."
3,Okay when it works,"Very fussy little gadget. It took several people to try to make this work. It may just be that it took a lot of priming. Once I got it started it performed well enough, but don't let it go out during your project or it may not finish."
5,Hookah Coal Torch,"I bought this sepcifically to use for lighting hookah coals mainly because I don't like lighting the coals on the stove and having to carry the burning coals through the house.The product itself was perfect, worked flawlessly and is easy for anyone to use. I don't like the safety switch because you have to push it down every time to try and light it. If it doesn't light the first couple of times it gets annoying. The adjustible flame switch is nice but I don't have much of a need for it. It is also nice to see how much fuel you have left in the convenient window located on the side."
5,super fun,This is a fun tool. I've always wanted one and decided to splurge. I will be using it for crème brulee on Christmas day.
3,Sunny side up--YES; Sous vide--NO,"We bought this torch to brown meats cooked sous vide. It doesn't do that effectively, I think because the heat output isn't enough. I understand this isn't the torch's intended use, but sous vide aficionados tout torches like this, and I thought sour viders would want to know.While it doesn't NOT work, it is finicky---hard to get lit, hard to keep lit. For occasional in-home use it's certainly adequate.Imperfections notwithstanding I would buy it again. It's great for pan fried eggs sunny side up. It takes just a few seconds to blast that last little bit of translucent egg white, without having to leave the whole egg cooking until the yolk is hard."
4,sweat a copper joint? You bet.,"I got this for the kitchen. It works nice, fast easy, maybe a little tricky to light first time.looks nice, works well what more could one say.I was fixing a burst pipe from last winter, only just got around to it a couple of days ago. My torch started flaring out, stopped shutting off and let me down. I really wanted to put this job to bed, so I went inside to the kitchen and pulled out my ""BonJour"" first off the size is so small it let me get a much better angle, and at full blast it heated the pipes, sweated the joint just a little slower than a joint torch..Bravo to this little tool, it is coming camping ,removed one star due to awkward lighting up."
5,Perfect Torch,"I have always wanted a torch for Creme Brulee and I finally bought one. I am very pleased with the BonJour Chef's Torch. It is very easy to operate, I love that it has a viewable fuel gauge and it has a safety latch. I have aready used it for Creme Brulee and also to add a nice finished touch to some meringue. I recommend this to anybody looking for their first torch."
4,Solid Chef Torch,"I was looking for a torch primarily for making creme brulee. This one got good reviews on Amazon so I figured I would give it a try. I have only used it a few times but it works well for making the brulee. It is made solidly and puts out a strong flame. I was in a department store and picked up a different brand of torch, which felt very cheap compared to this BonJour Torch. The fuel gauge is a nice additional feature included with this torch. I am happy with the purchase of this torch."
4,Works great!,"After doing exhaustive research on kitchen torches, I decided on this one because of the good reviews and price. This product is easy to fuel, easy to hold and use, and has great safety features. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because on the lowest setting the flame is fairly large, and at the highest setting the flame is way too big to be useful. I made a great brulee and some in-home smores with this and it worked great! I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a reliable kitchen torch."
4,awesome!,"I bought this for cupcakes, and it works great! took a while to figure out how to fill it properly, but once we did, it was amaizng! love this tool! I only gave it 4 stars because I know it's not ""top of the line"" but it works well!"
1,No butane size indication,"I went to 9 stores before I finally found one that carries butane bottles (Home Depot). Unfortunately, the nozzle on the bottle was too small and the gas simply leaked out when I tried to fill the torch. Nowhere on the box or packaging does it indicate what size nozzle works with filling the torch. To me, this is a huge safety hazard and it caused me to inhale butane which I really didn't want to do. I'm tempted to chuck this into the trash out of anger."
4,great torch,"For creme brulee this torch is perfect, carmelizes well and quick.For dabbing i think this torch disperses a lot of heat before it reaches the nail and a different torch should be purchased"
2,It's ok.....when it holds fluid.,"This product looks good, if it only performed that well.I have issues with this product holding butane fluid and I'm not sure why. I have looked in the reviews and have not seen anyone else having these issues. I am looking at trying a new brand for my next one.The flame on this guy is amazing,but again not being able to hold fluid makes this guy pretty useless."
5,Great torch!,"I just love this torch. Bought it to use when I make creme brlée. It's just great, works perfectly every time."
4,Nice for what it is,"I got the BonJour Creme Brulee Culinary Torch for Christmas. It works well as a torch for cooking. You need to buy fuel. The reason it's not a five star product is because the large button you use is a bit tough to hold down for a long period of time, say when torching a creme brulee. It looks like it would be comfortable, but it's not. Other than that, I'd recommend it."
5,Love the flame.,"Maype I am a piro, but it is fun to just light and watch the intense flame come out. Efffective in teaching the cat to keep of the new leather sofa... Please, just kidding, We love our cat"
5,A must have for serial communications troubleshooting,"Though devices using serial connectivity are becoming a thing of the past, there are still a good number of devices that are not available with native USB connectivity and require serial port connectivity. Unfortunately, serial devices are not as plug-and-play as USB devices and thus often require some level of troubleshooting to get them up and working. This handy little tester can be invaluable in determining if the serial connection is mated properly and if communications is occurring. I have used a number of these types of devices over the years and this one is right on par The only drawback is the LEDs are not as bright as I would like to see. If you are in a brightly lit room or out of doors, it may be difficult to see the indication. Overall, I give this tester a thumbs-up."
4,Las Habichuelas rule.,"As a student of the flamenco guitar who has studied in Granada it was very nostalgic to see the Habichuelas in their home town and although I was aware of the band Ketama I was more interested in Pepe and Juan senior than the younger generations. I especially enjoyed the concert in La Plateria, one of my favorite venues in Granada. This testament to one of the great family traditions of Gypsy Flamenco is a worthy addition to any flamenco afficiando's collection even if it just makes you want to go to Granada to experience it first hand."
5,SWEET KNIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this knife is durable and awesome if your going to get a knife get this one
5,"Good knife, good value, terrific company.","Although it isn't a top-of-the-line knife, the gator rubber handle is, simply put, amazing. I've used this knife for almost anything and I've never had a problem with it slipping. Whether covered in water, oil, or even animal fat (from gutting a deer at single digit temps) I've never had a problem with this knife.The only drawback I've found is that the knife seems to go dull much more quickly than any of my other knives... despite what I do to keep it in tip-top shape."
5,drill bit,"For some odd reason, I guess I don't know my own strength, but anyway I always seem to need another drill bit in this size. It's perfect for my Makita drill and it's the one that I use the most. Awesome!"
3,Not bad for a first try,Don Omar didnt do bad at all in producing this album....He did all right and the album was good....Not the best cuz i thought it would have been more of him droppin lyrics wit some good rappers....He and other producers are taking chances on newcomers and he needed to focus on himself more with some old school cats and new people....nonetheless...its a good album....some tracks i jus had to burn on to my computer
3,"Pretty ring, but it bends easily","After only 3 days of normal wear, my ring somehow got bent, and as a result, there are now a couple points in the ""links"" that are separated. Not so much that I can't wear the ring, but I am concerned about it breaking in half if it gets bent again."
4,love this ring,"This ring is a beautiful shiny silver band. I love the celtic never-ending knot design. I like the fact that the design goes completely around the ring, and doesn't have a ""solid space"" because my rings twirl around my finger and I wouldn't want to keep twirling it back around to see the design. It's sturdy and well made and fits nicely. I wear a 5 1/2 size ring so I ordered a size 6 and it is just right for my hand. It is about a 1/4 inch width and would not be suitable to wear with other rings on the same finger, but it looks very nice as a solo ring. I am very pleased with it."
1,Who cares?,"Tailhook '91 is now a dead issue. After eight years of Clinton's disgraceful debauchery in the White House, the Tailhook scandal now looks like a choirboy's convention."
5,Highly recommeded !!,"As a sensitive sleeper, I 've been looking for a heater for my bed room, working quietly, keep the space at a set temperatue.This heater satisfies me 100 percent.It is small, but really warms up my room quickly, not taking up much space in my small bedroom, keep it at a desired temerature all night long, and most importantly works quietly.It is rather costly compare to other budget heaters, but it is worth it. I higly recommend this product."
3,Good heater but not long lived,"I'm on my second Bionaire heater like this. It's great because it's quiet, small, puts out a good amount of heat and has the remote control. It does lose contact with the remote unit ever so often, but that's not a big problem. The first one we had burned up a bit when I moved the two halfs to direct the heat elsewhere. The rotating halfs must have a wire going through that gets worn, or.. Anyway it was replaced by warranty. Currently, this one has flashed an electrical spark once recently and is starting to smell a bit (electrical smells) and the fan is starting to rumble a bit. Time to replace it. To be fair we've used it a lot but these don't seem to last more than a year or so with a lot of use."
1,If This Book Had an Honest Title...,"almost no one would have bought it. It's not about assessing sex offenders at all. It's an attack on the civil commitment of sex offenders. The author spends the entire book attacking the assessment methods used in the civil commitment process. Even this attack is false, since Campbell is an ideologue who opposes committing sex offenders and has a new line of attack every year. It's not surprising that Dr. Campbell has no suggestions at all on how sex offenders should be assessed, since he has never worked with sex offenders. He's too busy writing books attacking things other people do. The ethical code of the American Psychological Association prohibits psychologists from practicing outside their area of knowledge, but apparently Dr. Campbell is above such petty rules. For anyone who needs real information about evaluating sex offenders, see Dennis Doren's book."
5,The sound of Satan's fists beating Santa Claus,"This album is a healthy serving of sleaze. Their debut disc, ""One Night High"" is also great. If you like the Dwarves or Turbonegro, you'd probably spin this one enough to merit buying it,"
3,Silver NOT Black,"First, the system is Silver, not the advertised BLACK. Second, the speaker wires are very poor (as previously noted)and should be replaced with better gauge if you wish to use the system in any room outside of a closet. With that said, the system has a decent cost/performance ratio. Not bad for under $300."
3,Switched Outlet Needed,I gave 3 stars because of the lack of a switched AC outlet. This is desirable for the subwoofer power.
5,Great Product for Price,"This is probabaly the best system that $300 can buy. The only upgrade throughout the system should be all the cables (Speaker Cable, Subwoofer, Coax, optical, etc.) I was looking for something basic and this system exceeded expectations. Yamaha has good recievers so this system is easily upgradable."
4,banjo man,"I play 4-string banjo and this is mainly about the 5-string, however, the majority of information is still relevant. Mr Siminoff has set the standard on how to produce a worthwhile book on how to look after, and more importantly, how to set up a banjo. Thanks, a treasure, and is referred to often. Regards, Jack, New Zealand."
4,Great outdoor knife,Quality grade and tough enough for moderate outdoor use. 5 stars if made in USA.
5,Best Knife Ever!,"I actually bought this knife for my husband, who lost one just like it on a job site. He says it's the best knife there is."
4,good fishing knife,"Gerber is a great brand no matter were made. I bought 3 one for myself the rest gifts. The grip on this Knife is good for when water is invovled working in wet conditions or for out fishing. Blade holds a good edge. The only thing I would like on it is a pocket clip all though it is a little big for a pocket knife, I dont like the big sheath for a belt."
4,value and quality,"I received two Gerber folding knifes, one serrated the other plain, both are superb in value and quality. Fast delivery, highly recommended seller!"
4,Great knife,This knife is the perfect size and I carry it constantly. The sheath is a bit cumbersome so I don't use it. The blade holds an edge pretty well for the price.
3,Garden expert,"This book gives you the basics of how to grow and take care of your garden from separating bulbs,maintenance of your garden and so much more."
5,Beautiful Ornament!!,I love this Hollywood Glass Ornament!! Brings me the magic of Hollywood to my Xmas tree!! Great detail and beautiful colors!!
3,LA Skyline/Hollywood Ornament.,"I was disappointed in the detailing, paint job, etc. I have collected blown ornaments for many years and I would have to say the quality wasn't as good as I had hoped for. I probably would not have bought this ornament had I seen it in person."
2,"A workshop, not a textbook","I have no rating for this book, so I put in 2 stars on the basis that workshops are not general interest books.This volume contains the proceedings of a workshop on Analog Integrated Neural Systems held May 8, 1989, in connection with the International Symposium on Circuits and Systems."
3,Got it as a Gift,"I use to be a HUGE fan of Metallica, but after there S&M album I just lost hope on them. It good there releasing a music video collection dvd FINALLY. But if you don't feel like paying $[...] for videos, do like I did, download all of there videos and make your own collection dvd using Nero 9 software. UPDATE: Got this dvd today, I noticed in the video for ""Turn The Page an unblurred breast, what's up with Unblurring one scene and not all of them. [....]"
1,"just the ""new"" metallica","I remember when Metallic a said they would never make a video. Just get Kill em all, Ride the lightning and Master of puppets. This was metallica. They died with Cliff Burton. RIP Metallica"
3,Long in the Tooth,"Metallia: The Garage Band that won't go away. Like most old rock and roll bands that loose the edge, out comes the videos next concert footage and the endless Great Hits CD's volumes 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, , , , , . Nice stocking stuffer for the head banger in your life."
3,"Awesome greatest hits collection of videos, but beware this version is censored!","This is the collection of pretty much all of the Metallica videos from 1989 through 2004 (yeah, pretty obvious from the title, I know). So as a die hard Metallica fan since 1989 (the first time as a 13 year old, I saw the One video on MTV, I was just floored by the power of their music), how can I only give this comprehensive collection only 3 stars?Well, don't get me wrong, the video quality is fine, sound is good on my 5.1 surround sound system. But the a number of the videos (Turn the Page, Whiskey in the Jar) as other reviewers have also noted, are the editted, censored version. Look, I'm old enough to have seen enough titties so it's not like I got this DVD to see tits, but it does bother me a bit that I don't get to see what the director/Metallica originally envisioned for their videos.So this gets 3 stars from me, but it's not really like we have another option to get the uncensored version."
4,Good Companion to Thomas Stanley's books,"This book is a good companion book to the books by Thomas Stanley (The Millionaire Next Door, The Millionaire Mind). Most of the people profiled in the Thomas Stanley books own their own business. In this book, the author shows you how you can also become rich by investing and without day-trading. Change to title and this is worthy of 5 stars."
4,The CG series continues,"As a fan of the book, the movie, and Henlein in general, I bought all the DVDs in this series. The CG is a little crude, sometimes it looks like a very old computer or X Box game, but that said these DVDs are the only way I can see more of Johnny Rico and friends. Lets hope that someday they make a big budget movie that is spot on with the book's origional story. Until then we will make due with what we have."
5,The Zephyr Campaign,The Best Anime I have seen. Wonder why they stopped making anymore series. I hope they make these more.
5,Give US More,I totally agree with everyone that's reviewed so far. We need the missing 2 catchall clips and the last few episodes!! Why stop when your so close to finishing the mission?
5,Zephyr,"The long awaited DVD that completes the series. Although I believe it was called the Ice Asteriod Campaign, but eh Zephyr is better. Now only if they will release the clip shows and the lost episodes that were never aired. ::sigh:: maybe one day"
3,I got because I could find it nowhere else at the time....,"That said, I do not regret being able to complete the series. But at the time this part of the series was created, money was an issue - and it shows in the finished product big time. Movement is incredibly choppy and backgrounds are not good at all. I understand that this was at the infancy of CGI, but wow...it sometimes hurts just to watch."
5,this is awesome,now this is an awesome lego set the pit styop is the best part there is a guyt that does fuel 4 do tires and there is the driveer obvously it has the formula one ferrari which in real life michael shumacer i think thats his name but it s a good lego sert (dont mind my typing plz)
1,Product Never Received,"I ordered this product over on Sept. 12th. Today is Oct. 15th and am still waiting it's arrival. I have directly called the company twice to find out what is happening, and they just tell me it's been shipped.They also will not give me a refund due to the fact that they have not received a returned item. So, basically it looks as though I'm out $30.I have tried to contact someone from Amazon to voice my displeasure, but cannot find any numbers or addresses, so this will also be the last time I shop through Amazon."
5,"Great classical music, a brilliant orchestral performance, and a low price!","This CD contains the favorite Anton Bruckner 4th Symphony, aka the ""Romantic"" symphony, performed by the talented Berlin Philharmonic with the all time great conductor Herbert von Karajan at the helm! And while this CD is no Deutsche Grammophon, it is a worthwhile and recent (2004) recording of a classical music collection staple. Amazon currently has many such all time favorite classical music pieces on sale for under $10, so add a few more greats to your cart and receive free shipping in the deal as well."
1,Low budget in more ways than one.,A waste of time. Bruckner does not respond well to band-masters. End.
3,Not What I Expected,"I have been out of the Foxpro world since 5.0. I was looking for a reference that would help get me up to speed and provide some assistance, some example code. This was not what I expected, and it seems a little light given the ""stars"" who contributed to it.Why can't the Foxpro community come out with a book like Ben Forta's Web Application Construction Kit for Cold Fusion? He shows you how to use the product, goes into each command and function, gives you example after example, tells you how to tie in to common and some uncommon areas, and generally provides the book that the software publisher SHOULD have published in the first place.C'mon, Foxpro authors! Kick it up a notch!"
4,Nice First Truck,"We bought this for my 12 month old for his first birthday. He really likes the fact that it lights up and I like that fact that it does so without making noise! The retractable tow hook makes it ""rumble""....very cute. Overall I would say this is a good buy for a beginer trucker!"
2,Product is not as appears in the photo,"I have been using the exact Gerber MP 600 for many years now. I just purchased 4 more, to give to family members. When I received them, they were different from the photo. The photo on Amazon.com shows a standart drop point blade, with some serrations in the back of the blade. The product arrived with a straight blade, and 2/3's of the blade is serrated, with only about 1/2 inch being a standard knife blade. This product is completely different from the photo on Amazon.com. I'm sure the quality of the total unit is fine, just disappointed to not receive the actual product shown on the Amazon.com."
4,Unfortunate wrong picture,"I loved all the Gerber products I've owned so far. When my last Gerber multitool was stolen, I figured I would buy an exact replacement. The picture for this product IS the one I had. This multitool has a few difference which is the build quality and the blade. Not the same at all! I preferred the one I had but this is still a solid product. I'm just disappointed that the item I received is not the one displayed."
4,Great everyday pal,"I own a Car Repair Shop in Argentina and like a famous Credit Card Commercial, feel the same: NEVER LEAVE HOME WITHOUT IT. I give it an everyday use, even on week ends at home or field. Woulk like to be able to buy the holster separately, because of wear and tear."
5,Gerber FTW!,"I've had this multi-tool for around a year now and I'm blown-away by how useful it is. With the modular bit drivers, not to mention everything else on this tool, I've found it useful for everything from Disc Golfing to IT (Information Technology (Computers)) work. Usefulness aside, the durability of this product is outstanding. For all these reasons and more, I rarely leave home without this tool; if you are on the fence about whether or not to get this tool, just do it, you won't regret it."
5,works great,"always been a fan of Gerber multi-tools, and this is no exception. a great multi-tool and plenty of tools. the bits that come with it is an awesome addition, makes this tool VERY useful. would definitely buy it again. have not had any problems with my tool, although admittedly i don't use it all the time like some might, i have one for my B.O.B. and for random stuff around the house, and it works great."
2,Keep Away From Heat,"Does a good job of juicing and it's hard to complain at this price, BUT the plastic lid and cup are made of such soft plastic that they deformed when they were a couple of inches from a hot toater oven. And they definitely are not dishwasher safe. This renedered the unit unusable. If you buy one keep it away from the heat."
1,Poor and unreliable quality,"I bought this product during the weekend in Fry's. The first time I used for my carrot juice and I cut the carrots into pieces to fit in the chute. When I turn on the power, the juice container craked and leaked all over my countertop, which was a mess.I tried to return to Fry's and it rejected because it was damaged. I tried to ask for the warranty replacement. The manufacturer rejected it claiming the container could be damaged in shipping or misuse or wash.I have read through the instructions and make sure the vegetable is not to big for the machine to handle. However, the poor and unreliable quality of this product cannot even survive any vegetable.I won't recommend this product if you want to use for vegetable juice at all. It is a ""lousy"" product."
4,Good for Price,"This product was perfect for what I was looking for - an inexpensive juicer that easy to clean. It does stain easily from strong colored veggies and fruits, i.e. carrots, spinach, blueberries, etc, but I think all juicers do. Great for those just starting to juice and don't want to commit to a more expensive machine yet."
2,Cannot clean without instruction or cone removal tool,"I liked the juicer at first because it seemed to work well, with the exception of a little leakage, but then when I tried to clean it, found that I could not remove the steel cone inside that cuts up the fruits and veggies. There was no instruction manual in the box, nor was there a tool so i had to scoop out all the waste myself. It ended up being completely inconvenient. What kind of juice doesn't tell you how to clean it?"

5,Great for the price,I have been trying to find ear buds that didn't hurt my ears after wearing them for 20 or more minutes and these do the job. I have tried at least 1/2 a dozen different kinds before trying these and would recommend them to anyone who has trouble with wearing ear buds for long periods of time.
1,Nnot worth that much,Nice book nice information but by no means is WORTH THAT MUCH please don't fall for that. Way too overpriced
5,such a deal!,"Heck, you get a dvd for gosh sake! Bonny is one of Merengues most versatile and talented performers. He writes, arranges, is a fabulous pianist, and uses his less than massive voice in chorus with his Coro. To wit, it's harmonic like the jazzy Manhattan Transfer and its unique and stll swings hot and sweet."
5,NJ Devils: True definition of the word TEAM,"I've been a Devils fan for four years now. They are the modern warriors and they are worth the price of admission IN GOLD! Other pro teams(NBA especially)should look at the Devils as role models for teamwork and inspiration. When one man goes down, 19 are there to back him up. Leadership starts with Scott Stevens, perseverence is with Ken Daneyko, commitment is John Madden, stregnth is with Turner Stevenson, talent is with Jeff Freisen, determination is Scott Gomez, power is Patrik Elias, truth is Brian Rafalski, back bone is coach Pat Burns.

3,Bead Cutting Lathe Chisels,I purchased this chisel set in hope of cutting beads that are of a uniform size. I have used the set once with mixed results. The chisel I used did not cut well and burned into the wood. I will try sharpening and perhaps will get better results but my basic recommendation is to stick with cutting the beads the good old - old fashioned way and save your $$$$.I have had good results with other Benjamin's Best Chisels. I love the Versa Chisels.
2,Not excited about this set.,"I am disappointed in this set. They cut beads, but not very nice beads. They should have had some instructions with the set - such as how to sharpen and use the tool! The set is packaged nicely - and the two larger chisels work much better than the smaller two. The small ones appear to chip out the wood."
1,The 6mm chisel is missed,"I am very disappointed with this productI have received 2 chisels of 8mm, and the 6mm chisel was not included into box.I live out of USA, and return item is not an option."
4,"Very Good, Lots of Photos","I liked the book. It talks about how graffiti evolved from the subways to railroad cars. It also talks about those people that do it and their styles. If you aren't a fan of graffiti on railroad cars I wouldn't buy it, it must just get someone more upset."
3,Not all stories are good.,"Some of the stories are hard to read and hardly interesting. While Mr. Jakes thinks these stories are great literature is his opinion, it's not mine. Some of these short stories are dynamite which makes up for the crummy ones. Just skip the crud and read the good."
5,nice,"I have had a knife of some sort on me for 30 years now. Usually a large folder of some sort or another. I had a Gerber LST magnum (the full size one) on my hip the first time I saw my wife, and so I always thought the Gerber knives were a good luck blade for me. The first time I worked with her, I used it to clip a thread on her skirt. Well, this is the same knife, only smaller. It is nice and stiff, just as a new knife should be. It locks firmly into place, and unlocks easily. It will smooth out a bit with use, and in a month or two of use, it will be slick. I got this knife for my Nephew's Christmas presant next Christmas. he will be 12 years old, and ready for his first knife. Uncle steve will be the favorite uncle this year.Steve"
5,Can't imagine not having it with me....,"About 27 years ago I put a Gerber LST into my pocket and left it there for 20 years. About 7 years ago I swapped it out for a Gerber Magnum LST Jr.This knife is ALWAYS in my pocket. It is thin, very light in weight (pretty much unnoticeable), and has a locking blade. It is extremely useful ... I would be VERY surprised if there was a single day during the seven years that I've had this in my pocket that I did not use it several times each day.This knife is in perfect condition ... it does not corrode in any way.I prefer the LST Magnum Jr to the LST as it is just a bit thicker than the LST and feels like a sturdier knife. I have given a couple of these away as gifts."
5,precious moments,"As a brand new mother, I received such encouragement from this book. I realized just how precious a privilege it is to be entrusted by God to raise one of His special gifts. I felt overwhelmed and underqualified as I realized how much my daughter will look to me. Even in the ""hard"" times of sleepless nights and fussy days, this book helped me see the joy and amazement in every moment. My only complaint of the book is that it ended too soon!"
3,Strangely unengaging,"Strangely unengaging is how ""Rusty Wires"" describes his impressions of this video, and I totally agree with that; couldn't put it better. An OK performance, but ... see the title. From myself, I'd only add that the best symphonies are, imo, the Bohm/Vienna Philharmonic collection (volumes I, II, and III from DG)."
2,Don't buy the grass,"This product seems like a waste of my money, comparatively. The taste and grit accompanied with it is awful too.The labeling is deceiving (to me), stating that there are 90 servings. When you read the fine print above, you're to take 3 servings a day. Then, when you read the label, it says that there is 610 mg of ""proprietary HSO probiotic blend"" and lists what that consists of (barley grass and oat grass being the first two listed). Only if you read the side of the package do you find that there are only 3 billion CFUs of actual probiotic in the three servings. That's the same amount you will find in as little as 1/2 a gram in products like Organic GUTPro orBio-Kult Probiotic. And you spend less per actual amount with these other brands. I do see the danger of getting a super potent product such as GUTPro though, if you don't use it wisely and carefully.I feel like I pretty much got scammed into buying some probiotic-laced grass."
2,Not bad,"Good product, however, the blend contains different grasses, and for some, these cause an allergic response or reaction. I prefer ones that contain no wheat, grains, soy or fillers, especially corn. Decent, not great."
1,I can't believe this has dirt in it!,Is this even safe for edible consumption? I want to return this because I am shocked to see actual dirt in it. Can some one reply and let me know if I can return for a refund - it's opened but not used.
4,Good,"This product is much like the probiotics for kids that is sold by the same brand, it will NOT dissolve in ANYTHING (hot or cold; I even put it in the blender!). I like this brand a lot and it works, but I'm done with this ""powder"" business. It's simply the fact that when my glass of whatever I've put this in is done, there's ALWAYS a ton of this stuff sitting at the bottom. This leaves me NEVER knowing how much or what part of it I actually got into my system. I've resorted to just putting the recommended dose straight into my mouth, then washing it down with about 6 oz of water. Otherwise, it works and it's a great product. I'll just be purchasing their capsules and tablets from now on."
3,Satisfied Customer,"My intent was to add this to home-made ice cream to make a sort of frozen yogurt, since I don't care for the tart yogurt taste of actual frozen yogurt. While this wasn't the best product for that purpose, since it's very green, it was extremely effective as a probiotic. I add it to water, it dissolves well, and I drink it plain. My stomach issues have been dramatically reduced by using this product. I would highly recommend this."
1,Not as good as they say!!,"I started this product 6 wks ago and nothing but problems!!! Three {3} bouts of gastritis, with one landing me in the hospital. This product did not help my stomach, but, made it worse. I discontinued use and feel much better. Go with Amazing Green Superfood. A superior product and one i have been using for over 1 year with no gastritis!!! This is a con item product by Rubin."
5,Chaparelle rocks! And I don't usually don't like country music.,"If you want to hear some amazing honky-tonk rockabilly Texas country, Jeff Hughes and Chaparelle is it! I am so lucky to live in Austin and get to listen to them live once in awhile. You'll start tapping your foot the minute you put this on..."
5,Delicious!,"I don't usually go gung-ho over fragrances--I've owned a few over the years that I liked and found attractive in fragrance, but when I first smelled Euphoria in a magazine ad I was hooked. The scent is warm,woody,full and sweet with a light oriental touch. And what's best is that Euphoria smells creamy, as though once you spray it on your skin it seeps into your skin as though it were a lotion. If there is one fragrance that is a Must-Have for 2005, Calvin Klein's Euphoria is it."
5,this is my most favorite perfume,"Jessica Savitch, you should never rub the area when applying perfume. It breaks it down. Shame on you for telling us to do that. I am over the age of 50, so I think I have a little more experience than you in this department. never, ever rub your wrists, apply the perfume to the areas you want scented. As it evaporates from your skin, the notes in the perfume will come forth, and areate the air around you. That is one reason I like this perfume so well. It stays with you longer than most!"
2,Not the one,"For Christmas I got my 9 year old son an electric guitar. I also got him this DVD. It started off by telling you the different parts of the guitar. After that you were trying to follow him playing a song. My son was confused right off the bat. It did not focus on the very basics like how to hold the guitar properly, telling you that you have to push the strings down hard to make it work. The correct way of pushing the strings down. So now I am looking to find another dvd. I would tell you not to buy this one."
4,Works as described for me,"I had considered this product a number of times but sat on the fence because of the price. A recent increase in my BP, despite taking the usual steps to lower it, required an increase in my medication which stabilized but did not lower it. I made up my mind then to try RESPeRATE. After a month of daily use, my BP as well as my resting pulse rate have all lowered.The machine is easy to use and requires only 15-20 minutes per session. I also find the routine to be meditative and relaxing. I recommend finding a quiet place to use it with no distractions or interruptions.As far the price, however, they should have included the carry/storage bag. The earphones supplied are no better than the throw-away type airlines sell for $2. They could have been better quality. Also the built in storage compartment is barely adequate for the sensor, belt and wires."
1,Did nothing for me,"This was a real waste of money, I started using it everyday in June '08, and kept using it all summer without a drop in my blood pressure AT ALL.I read it had a one month return policy, but they recommended using it for at least 6 weeks....Go figure. I E-mailed their customer support and NEVER heard from them. So between the failure to lower my blood pressure and no response from Resperate..I think my blood pressure might have actually gone up a little."
2,A lot of money for what it does,"I used this for about a month. Although it teaches you to breath slowly, so does a cassette and relaxation tape. It appears to be a lot of money for what you need."
4,resperate blood pressure,This item is very good. Easy to travel with. Accurate and easy to use. Compact and comes with travel bag. Optional battery is great when traveling.
1,Don't waste your money,"After using the device for several weeks I noticed little or no lowering of my blood pressure. The technique of slow breating can be accomplshed on your own with sufficient concentration. Also, the machine quit functioning properly after a time."
2,"NO customer support, product has SOME value, $50?","I just took mine back within the Costco (Goddess bless them :) one year electronic warranty review. I had called at 60 days and they reminded me I had a YEAR if I wanted to keep trying. They sold them a year ago for $239, tax AND ship included.CRAZY over-priced, because there IS no customer service (try calling Resperate) and all the machine knows to do is keep making you breathe slower. Breathing slower AND becoming AWARE of your breath definitely has value, but this machine WOULD kill you by stopping your breath because THAT is all it knows to do, KEEP slowing your breath down. No sweet spot, no ""you're there!""...just slower.I DO think it has some value, and you can learn the value of slowing your breath down within 60 days, and then SEND IT BACK until they come up with a likely upgrade that knows something more than just slow your breath until you STOP breathing...Success! NO more high bp problem, NOW you have NO blood pressure- you're dead:)"
4,Resperate Device,I have found this product to be of good quality and and effective in it's intended use.
4,"Not bad,","Basically a relaxation feedback device. I started with a breathing rate of 18/minute, over the first session I lowered that to 4/minute. 2nd I started at 10 and went to 3. I'm hovering about there now while on the machine. Not sure what it's doing for my blood pressure yet but it's certainly relaxing."
3,Best for those who struggle with the basics of staying healthy,"I am glad this product is available. Not for me, but perhaps for the majority of people who are not aware of the huge benefits of slow, deep relaxed breathing. If you are disciplined, and you are practiced, at yoga, relaxation response, or meditation, this product will seem a bit silly. You can save 300. bucks by following this advice: Take slow deep breaths for 10-15 minutes a day, take less than 10 breaths per minute, and try to do less if you can, but not below 5. Do this every day and watch your blood pressure go down. Thats it. I think they could send a CD with the same tracks on it and give you90% of what this things does. I sent mine back and opted to just do the breathing with my cheap timer...Kudos to this company for making a drug free way to lower blood pressure. It will help a lot of people i am sure"
1,Works but you can accomplish same results for FAR less.,Breathing slower and deeper does work. But why pay 300 for something so simple?I downloaded an application called Breathing Zone for my iPhone. There are other comparable apps available in the app store too.This app cost only 2.99!! just plug in your headphones and follow along. Super easy and works the SAME way as this overpriced machine.Resperate company - you should be ashamed for charging so much for something that really helps people.
1,may as well shred your money for a ticker tape parade,"I guess this product may work a bit if your hypertension is caused by too rapid, too shallow breathing otherwise forget about it. The machine prompts you to inhale and exhale to musical tones until your breath rate reaches 10 breaths per second then it lowers your breath rate to the point that if you follow the cues your breath rate will get down to about 4 1/2 breaths per minute. The problem with this is the manual suggests not letting your rate fall below 5 breaths per minute so then why doesn't it stabilize around 6 breaths per minute? When I contacted customer service I NEVER got a response. This is a sure sign of a company selling a ripoff product. I've had it for a few months and it mostly had no effect on my blood pressure but what was worse is that on a few occasions I took my blood pressure before using the Resperate and after where my blood pressure was actually HIGHER afte using the product."
4,Not bad,This product does relax you so it would lower your pressure to a point. I used it a bunch of times and it teaches you to relax. You wont believe how unrelaxed you really are until you use this. I would recommend this to help lowere your pressure.
1,A Piece of Junk,"RESPeRATE Blood Pressure Lowering DeviceI bought this product 3 years ago, and was then diagnosed with breast cancer so I could not begin to use it on a regular basis. I just began using it 4 weeks ago and the sensor broke. I called the company to ask about a repair and they said they do not repair anything - you have to send the machine back for a new one for which they charge you $[...] (original cost was $[...] for 4 weeks of use - you do the math). All they needed to do was replace the sensor,but why do that when they force you into buying a new machine. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
4,I used the new ULTRA much better built from what I hear,I am only 24 but since I was 14 doctors and nurses have always been surprised by my blood pressure; especially given my skinny athletic build and overall great health. Recently over the past two years my blood pressure crossed the line from prehypertension into hypertension (148 average systolic). My doctor wanted to put me on blood pressure medications but I asked her to give me a month to bring it down. I was already really active and eating relatively healthy so I didn't really know what to do then I stumbled upon this and gave it a try. I also started drinking teas with hibiscus. So either the hibiscus or the resperate has cured my blood pressure!!! Also it is great for relaxation... Obviously the the device is not worth $300 dollars if it wasn't for the fact that it improves your health though it is well built... but not $300 dollars well built... know what I mean? I would like a lit up or colored screen because I use mine mostly at night
2,Didn't help,"I was looking forward to seeing if Resperate would help with my B/P. Unfortunately, after 5 straight weeks, it increased my B/P, not decreased it. I thought the guiding tones were annoying.Quite disappointed."
3,"Good, but not good enough","This may look like a great invention; it may have helped many, but I just can't see anything in it that is worth the price tag. There is nothing that this device can give you a 15-minute yoga session can't give. And, if you are too lazy to do yoga for 15 minutes, chances are that you are too lazy to use this device for 15 minutes. The price tag may force you to use it for 30 days, but after that you are stuck with it and it will probably end up under the bed along with all other ""easy-storage"" gadgets.Negativity apart, it is actually a great invention. It does a good job in sensing your breathing pattern and forces you to stick to a pattern for 15 minutes after which it shuts off by itself. It guides you through a pattern with ascending and descending soothing musical notes. It is quite relaxing and you will find yourself yawning by the end of the 15 minute session. But, again, it is too pricey for what it does and it is not anywhere nearly good as simple yoga."
5,"Yes, it does work!","I don't know why, but Amazon never posted my review, so I will try again.First let me say that I am in no way affliated with InterCure, the maker of the Resperate. I am just an average person who was looking for a way to lower his blood pressure without using drugs and enduring their dreaded side effects.To make a long story short, I was desperate to lower my blood pressure. It was peaking at 150/100 during the most stressful part of my day. Well, after using the Resperate device for about 2 months, my blood pressure has dropped to an average of about 115/75!I have not experienced any side effects. But, there have been some additional benefits, such as improved sleep,mental clarity, and stress relief.If you are reading this most likely you are trying to lower your blood pressure. You have nothing to lose by trying the Resperate. Go for it!"
1,It just didn't add anything,When I finally got it to work. I was below the level it was training to reach.
3,Resperate,"Probably, I have not had the chance to throughfully try it. I need to watch the video to get more information on his use. I think from what I have tried up to now, that it will help me a lot."
2,May or may NOT work for you.....,"Purchased this machine for my wife (born 1949) who has high blood pressure (150+/90+ untreated) and Type-II diabetes. Had high hopes as this was not a drug-related therapy. But was vastly disappointed by lack of positive results. Yes, she enjoyed using it. But her blood pressure was not improved.HERE IS MY ANALYSIS for your consideration. If your high plood pressure is caused by stress and the cares of life, RESPeRATE may work for you. But there is no mechanism by which it can address or cure arteriosclerosis. So, carefully analyze the cause of your high blood pressure before buying!"
4,Works well but there are cheaper alternatives,"I have this product and use it daily. It looks to me that there are some iPhone alternative application out there that do the same thing. Specifically iBreathe. You may want to check these apps out if you have an iPhone, if anything its nice to have when traveling. I was surprised to see that it even uses the phone as a sensor like the actual device."
1,Not successful,"I reluctantly gave up on this product after a serious effort to make it succeed. I followed the instructions conscientiously and even doubled the time required over the weeks.Resperate claims when you buy you receive ""live coaching from dedicated, experienced Resperate Care professionals."" This is Marketing fabrication. When I called for additional direction my ""dedicated professional's"" idea of assistance was to re-read the instruction booklet. Nor could she answer any of my questions. Resperate's on-line information is more extensive, but still my blood pressure did not drop.I admire the technology and am pleased some find this non-drug method effective in addressing high blood pressure. I do think it is overpriced in relation to the production cost. I also found that after using it for the prescribed month I was getting bored with the breathing tones. I see there are numerous studies on the benefits of meditation in lowering blood pressure and perhaps this is the avenue to proceed."
4,Works great but expensive.,"I read all about this item and was looking to buy it but it was a bit expensive so I began looking on ebay for used ones. No luck. Then I had a bright idea and decided to check to see if they make an ap for the iphone that does the same thing. They do! It's $4.99 and works great. When I use it, my blood pressure goes down by 20 points."
2,bad companay,"The device seemed to work when it worked. It started to act up a few months after I got it. The problem is with customer service as you have got to go through he!! to contact or talk with anyone.For me there was some inprovement when it worked, but the major inprovments were with exercice and diet. Many times when I was done I felt like I been druged when getting up as it did relax me to that point.It will work for some but beware of no suport as you can leave a message and they will get back to you.... yeh right!, emails the same."
2,Disgusted,"Be forewarned! My son was out of the country and left his Resperate at home for six weeks. When he returned, it wouldn't power on at all! I checked the springs, replaced the batteries, etc. And still nothing. When I called their service rep, they said it's only warrantied for a year and to repair it would cost $200! Are you kidding me? A device at this price range? Don't buy this! You can do heart healthy breathing for free at the Pranayma app on Apple devices and it works to lower blood pressure without fear of mechanical failures like this!"
1,Not worth it,"While the stone and earring itself is beautiful, the post broke off when putting into my wife's ears. she did not even get to wear them one time. poor quality for the price. I could go to the Jewelry store and get a better quality for less price. I do NOT recommend these AT ALL"
5,Healing the hollowed parts,"This breathtaking novel maps a few weeks in the life of Amy who returns to her small hometown to consider her relationship with her girlfriend. She encounters two of her childhood friends, Gina (who now works in a lesbian bar) and Gavin (who is dangerously anorexic), and together the three collide into and reconcile past pain and experiences. Banding with Gina to help Gavin, Amy rekindles her attraction to Gina. Sifting through the ebb and flow of memory, she also comes to understand more about her continuing self-mutilation. Echoing aspects of Eric Swanson's ""The Boy in the Lake"", Green gives us a beautiful novel exploring the invisible and visible scars we all inflict on ourselves and others. My favorite line from the novel: ""The hollows of the body were what filled up with hurt, and you couldn't starve them away."""
4,Cause and Effect,"Although mildly predictable, this novel is a powerful read for anyone interested in how one gets from point A to point B with a twist or two inbetween. In a style reminiscent of The Sparrow, Amy's story is told in two times, her childhood with Gavin and Gia and the rediscovery of her childhood friends as an adult. At times difficult to follow, the style nevertheless leads to two stories; Amy's battle with Gavin's anorexia and Amy's discovery of herself.In the end, it's a good book for a slightly haunting read, but it's not a romance so don't expect a cure-all ending."
3,Swear to God,"Scott Hahn writes another inspirational book to instruct the general Catholic population about the power of the sacraments. It is written simply and clearly. He talked about Baptism, Confirmation, Holy Eucharist, Penance, Anointing of the Sick, Holy Orders and Matrimony. I especially liked the chapter on Sex, Lies and Sacraments where he described the sacredness of the marriage covenant."
3,Oaths and Sacraments,"I loved Roam Sweet Home, and The Lamb's Supper gave a refreshing perspective. I read each book in a coule of days. Scott seems to be right on Doctornally Speaking however, this book leaves me wanting more depth on the Sacraments themselves. Scott talks a lot about Swearing, Covanents, and Oaths, but very little on the actual sacraments. It took me weeks to struggle through this dry book. I wanted to give this book to a friend who just got married. Now after reading it, I have changed my mind."
3,Excellent overview of the Sacraments,Scott writes with a warm and witty style that keeps you entertained while you learn.
2,Help Out Is Not On This CD!,"""Help Out,"" one of Bo Diddley's greatest efforts, is NOT on this CD. The CD and liner notes state that ""Help Out"" is found at track #8. What actually appears at track #8 is a mediocre vocal track titled ""Little Girl."" ""Help Out,"" an instrumental, and ""Little Girl"" are both from the 1962 LP ""Bo Diddley and Company."" The liner notes state that ""Help Out"" is an instrumental from the ""Bo Diddley and Company"" LP. It appears that producers intended to put ""Help Out"" on this CD, but somehow goofed."
2,Large no. of typos,I love the content of this book and it is great to have these old strength titles available BUT this is the third book I have purchased from Physical Culture Books and each one had a huge number of typographical errors. I'm talking lots. It's hard to understand how books with so many mistakes could be released for purchase. The errors include spelling mistakes but also key stroke errors particularly when relating to measurements e.g. heights or weights. It would appear they have technical problems with their word processing system.
5,"""""Woo! Woo! Woo!""""...NEW REVIEW !","Well, from eleven to ONE is how many dollars this'll cost ya. And a bargain it is - especially for the foreign,or domestic, Stooge Fan that speaks ENGLISH, SPANISH and/or FRENCH. Those are the subtitles.Spoken-language audio tracks are in ENGLISH & SPANISH.If you're looking for a bargain -- and you ARE bilingual -- THIS is for you. If you've got money, very little shelf-space, and want all 191 Stooges' shorts in ONE box, then, go for the ULTIMATE STOOGES' COLLECTION for about $90.If you are Spanish, French or Portuguese, naturally, you'll want to see all of my latest reviews to see WHICH ofthese are available in YOUR native language."
2,Way Too Much Shemp,"Shemp had been called a much more talented comedian than Curly.That shows you what reviewers know...Shemp is always going to stand in Curly's long, wide shadow. To Stooge fans, it's either watching Curly or waiting to watch Curly.In this [really short] DVD you get more Shemp than Curly...I'd pass."
1,Counterfeit!,"I've been using Oral B Floss Action brushes for years, and have been extremely satisfied with the product. Unfortunately, like many others who purchased this product, the item I received from Amazon was clearly a counterfeit replica that does not work effectively. When I called the distributor directly, I was informed that they ""do not sell counterfeit items."" Extremely disappointed."
1,Fake product,"I just bought these off of 3rd party seller on amazon and they are definately knock offs. The brushes feel flimsy and i do not feel ""clean"" after brushing. I will not purchase these online anymore."
1,Watch out for this seller.,"I purchased this product from Direct Super Center. Little did I know that brush heads can be fake. I should have known better when I received the package. 3 individually packaged heads in one opened package. I thought that had happened through the handling process, but after all 3 heads broke down with in one week of normal use, I figured the package had been tampered with.This seller is giving me the run around. As of yet, I have not received a refund. Good luck if you try to call them! No answer.I did buy new brush heads directly from Amazon and they are perfect."
1,Wrong Brushes,"Well, I was greatly dismayed to find that the brushes shipped to me did not fit my Oral B toothbrush so my advice to buyers is, BE SURE these are the right brushes for your Oral B. We'll see how complicated it is dealing with Amazon to get the right ones which may actually may be of more interest to buyers than a review of the brushes themselves."
2,Broken brush heads,"I thought each Oral B brush head was supposed to last 3 months. After about a month, the screws fell out of 2 of the brush heads leaving them useless. I'm on the last brush head and was not expecting to have to replenish my supply this early. Rather disappointed."
2,Oral B Floss Action refill,"This item was priced right, so I bought it to replace my former Oral B brush head. This product's bristles are much too stiff to clean my teeth thoroughly. They do not get down into the areas between my teeth like my former brush head did. It also vibrates against my teeth easily making it uncomfortable to use. the quality is good, but the application is too stiff for me. Oral-B FlexiSoft(tm) Brushhead works best for me. Maybe that is why it costs $12 each at Walgreen/CVS."
1,Oral B Floss Action refill,I have gone through all three of the refills in four months. The mechanical rotary action wears out long before the bristles show any significant color change from blue to white.
1,Oral-B Floss Action Head Refills,Didn't last long! Bought 3 of these in Jan and they're all broken at the head. They would work fine for a week or so and the the head comes loose. Must be a bad batch...
5,Great,Love this toothbrush and refills. Not sure what else i can say but the oral b is a great product. The base has an incredible battery life and easy to travel with.
5,Very effective,"I'm not really sure this does enough flossing, so I do floss the regular way, and also use a waterpik, However, it can't hurt, and these brush heads last about 4 months. A bit expensive, but health is worth it."
5,Great Toothbrushes,I find these toothbrushes with the built-in floss action are far better than the ones without. They are definitely worth the extra $$.
1,Counterfeit or Oral B has gien up on quality,"Some of the brushheads are loose right out of the pack, the others becomes loose after very little use. When the burshheads are loose, they don't rotate back and forth the way they are supposed to when you hold the brushhead against your teeth; they can picnch your lip or cheek, and they can come apart in your mouth. And they can even come apart in your mouth. I've seen knockoffs that are of this poor quality. Either these are counterfeit Oral Bs or Oral B has let the quality degrade substantially."
4,"Great, affordable, useful, durable product","I bought this product using subscribe an save, what a great deal! This is a very reliable effective product. I bought these for my 10 year old toothbrush. Love it still!"
4,My Fave Brush Head,"We've been using Oral B Floss Action brush heads for years. We really feel they do the best job by far. The cost is a edging on ridiculous, however, so lately we've been using the generic version from Target. They are identical to this name brand and probably manufactured by Oral B themselves. Costs about five bucks less than this standard pack. If the generics weren't available when I need them, I'd definitely buy these name brand ones again. But if I can save a few bucks with Target's generic, then that'll be my first choice."
1,i paid 12 $ & 19.25 $ & returned .But refund back 1.11 $,I ordered 1 of Oral B Floss Action 3 pack brush head refill at 12 $ first time.I couldn't use because it didn't fit with my machine.Amazon sent me another one at 19.25 $ after several month.I return both at the same time for refund.Amazon refund me at 1.11$ for both. both cost me 31.25 $.Beware of return product & the way amazon treat their customer.
1,Too big and Hurt,"I've been using this for 3 months, and they are too big and hurt.I would never buy this again.I wonder if anyone would like this kind?I would rather get the one that came with it"
2,came without packaging or barcodes,"For an item of personal sanitary use, I would have expected the refill brushes to have been delivered in their original packaging, Rather each was loose, in a baggie."
4,works good. a little bit hard.,"My original toothbrush head came with oral B 1000. This one is harder than the original one - I know it's supposed to be hard - and it took me sometime to use to it. If you don't like a hard brush, you may want to choose other brush heads."
1,oral b floss action 3 pack head refill,I don`t think you will like my review. I have not been happy with these brushes at all-- they are too hard.
5,Great product,I've been using these brushes since they first came out and believe they do a much better job that do regular brushe.
1,FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE,THIS ITEM WAS COUNTERFEIT. A FAKE PRODUCT. COMPARISON WITH A GENUINE ORAL B FLOSS ACTION BRUSH HEAD OBTAINED DIRECTLY FROM ORAL B REVEALED THIS IMMEDIATELY.
4,Just fine,This is the brush head that fits. It works. No complaints. Should I really move on to hyperbole about a toothbrush head? Buy it if it fits.
1,This item was missing from the package,I am unable to rate the product as it was not recieved.Package contained Oral B Dual Clean 6 count.
1,Not happy,As yet we have still not received this item so cannot review which I feel is pretty poor when we ordered it over six weeks ago but you were quick enough to take our money
1,I was misled .,These flossers was combined with the oral-b toothbrush set. The ad said to purchas all three sets for a good price. I opened the flossers to discover it did not fit my oral-b. Then I was advised to return the product only if it was unopened. I gave up after that.
1,OralB brushheads poor quality,In my opinion these are not authentic Oral-B toothbrushs. I have been using Oral B powerbrush for probably 7 years now and I have never had these problems with the brushes. These that I purchased through Amazon/Trend Marketing slide off the powerhead unit while brushing your teeth. The bristles felt much harder then any brand new true Oral-B heads I have ever purchased. After about 3 weeks of use one of the brushes fell apart in my wife's mouth...something a real Oral-B manufactured brushhead would never do.
3,"Effective, but big and pricey","If you like the small head of the standard round brush, be aware that these have a much larger head. The brush is a little stiff too. I have a pack, and I'll use them, but my next pack will be the standard brush heads."
1,copy of original--not the same thing,"This is rip off of the original Oral B brush heads with far fewer filaments in the center. A copy of the original product but not nearly as good. If you have been using these brush heads for awhile as I have (i.e., four years) you will notice your teeth don't feel as clean after a brush. They are an INFERIOR product and should not be sold under the Oral B label."
1,Counterfeit,"These are NOT Braun replacements. They do not have molded/stamped numbers inside the rear oval window on the rear of the brush head. These fakes are made with a plastic that wears out from the friction, and the brush head loosens up to a point where it starts to become useless after about 60 brushing cycles. The ""indicator"" bristles will never change color, because they aren't really indicator bristles... and because the head will start to fall apart after 3-4 weeks.REAL ORAL B REPLACEMENTS:Have a number stamped or molded inside the oval window on the rear of the brush head.Come with TWO color rings (not one)Last for several months, and the bristles change color LONG BEFORE the head loosens up from wear."
1,Not the real product,"I saw that these were ""by OralB"" and usually Amazon is reputable. These aren't the real OralB brush heads, they fall apart, the bristles are poor quality, and so on. I'm not sure whether to return to Amazon or to call OralB.Not pleased at all."
1,it's fake!,"I have used this kind of brushheads for years and the first 2 days I used my new brushheads that I used ordered worked fine. On the third day it feels very strange when I'm using it, as if it's not really brushing my teeth. I came to check if other buyers have this problem, and I saw some have the suspicion that they are fake brushheads. One reviewer suggests to check this picture with my brushheads, and yes, they look different! The ""Oral B"" is grey on the ones I just purchased, and the blue part of the brushhead is darker!! I have never got a counterfeit item from Amazon before! I really didn't think that I need to be worried about whether the product is fake or not on Amazon!"
4,Correct product,"This is exactly the product I ordered. Still, it took three shipments to receive the correct product. There were several models but only one fit my unit. My patience was sligtly stressed because I thougt that I woild have to purchase a new tooth brush to get a somplete unit.Thanks"
5,The Real Deal,"After reading about all the fake versions of these heads, we almost didn't order them. Glad we did, though. With the subscription discounts and coupons, it was around half as expensive as the local store - well worth the risk. Thankfully, the heads we got weren't fake - they had the serial numbers, two colored rings and no color bleeding. I'm not sure if the fakes are off the market or not, but if you're on the fence just order, then give Amazon a call if the ones you get aren't genuine..."
4,Seems Fake,"These seem fake. I just purchased real ones from Walgreens so I can actually compare them now. The ""fake"" ones would rust, the little yellow flossers would fall off the head, and the entire head holding the bristles would disconnect from the mechanism that moves it rendering it useless. But hey, I just went to my dentist and they said everything with my mouth/gums got better! I just wanted to note that there's a difference between these and the ones you purchase from the store."
1,Caused gum loss,"I exclusively used these heads for a year, though my dentist was happy with the cleanliness of my teeth, he noticed much faster gum loss.So now I have gone back to the softer heads without the floss action."
1,They do not look like the ones that I ordered directly from P&G store (manufacturer),"They did not fit propery and made a lot of noise. I ordered the other set directly from P&G store, which is manufacturer's store. The one that arrived from P&G was similar to the ones that I recieved with the unit. The one that I ordered from Amazon was different. Had different color logo along with other minor differences. I noticed after using it, that I have some grooves in the tooth enamel near gums. I do not know if it is because of the material used in the brushes of this particular toothbrush, but I did not have it before. When I used the original ones and the ones from P&G store, it did not occur."
4,Good deal!,If you like the Oral B floss action heads this is a good deal! Quick to ship and the same product you get in stores for twice the price!
4,rita's review,the order was received promptly and I am very satisfied with the quality and the price
5,Love the toothbrush heads,"I love these brush heads they make your teeth and gums feel clean, plus stimulates the gums."
1,My dentist said these Floss Action brush heads were damaging my teeth,I have an Oral B toothbrush and I ordered the Floss Action 3 pack to replace my old brush head. These feel significantly harder than my old brush heads. I had been using the new Floss Action head only a few weeks when I went to my dentist. He told me that my toothbrush was too hard and I was going to damage my teeth.TheThe Oral Health Biblealso states that you should always use a soft brush. It says a medium or hard brush can cause immediate damage to the soft tissues surrounding the teeth as well as severe damage to the teeth over time. It says the only thing to use a medium or hard brush on are to clean car parts.So I just threw away a $20 three-pack of brush heads because they the bristles are really hard.
4,Genuine Oral-B this time,Received brush heads yesterday and they appear genuine. I checked my packaging and product against the photos and info provided by Amazon customers. I have in the past received counterfeit brush heads from Amazon.
5,"It's better, and it's genuine.","The Floss Action provides significantly better cleaning action than the standard brush. They seem to last enough longer than the standard ones to more than make up for the difference in price. I always wonder if I will get a knockoff, but this package is a real Oral B product!"
4,I GOT A GENUINE,"just got mine today, paid about $14 with s/s and coupon.2 rings, right bristle colors, well/clearly layed out, defined, serial no on back, permanent logoTHANKS AMAZON!= )"
4,Oral-B Floss Brush Heads from Amazon,Purchased these heads to try with the new Oral-B 1000 Toothbrush I purchased to replace the Oral-B electric toothbrush I've been using for over 8 years now. I had read reviews from other people about these heads and thought I'd give them a try. I'm still using the head that came with the toothbrush so haven't tried these yet. I'm hooked on Oral-B so can only give an advanced guess that I'm going to like these (I've been very pleased with Oral-B products).
5,Nice Brushes,What can you say about Oral B except they clean the teeth of America! My wife loves her Brush and these are waiting in the wings.
4,Love it!,Purchased based off dentist's recommendation..Great toothbrush; teeth definitely feel cleaner afterwards compared to regular toothbrush.Timer setting is very useful; great feature for kids to ensure proper cleaning.The only con is the cost of the replacement heads. Expensive... Usually replace every 3 months.Buyer may want to research and consider this prior to purchase.
5,Good Replacements,"These Floss Action heads are the perfect replacements for myOral-B Vitality Floss Action Rechargeable Power Toothbrush, Blue and White. The flossy bits are very effective, but pretty harsh. My dentist is critical of the harsh action on the gums, but my hygienist likes my results, so decide for yourself.EDIT (10/6): I've been using this toothbrush for over a year now and have had very good checkups at the dentist. I'm very pleased. HOWEVER...I've discovered that the floss action heads don't travel well. I've damaged quite a few of these heads whenever I travel. The rotating head comes loose and doesn't work well after that. The flossy bits don't function well once the head is loose. And even worse, the wobbly head becomes kind of dangerous: it can pinch your lips pretty badly.I use a different toothbrush for travel now."
1,Possibly Fake,"The brush bristles are coming off after just 4 days of use, Possibly a fake being sold. I would prefer to buy from the local Target in future. It is too much hassle to ship it back now."
1,Flawed Design,"I have been using Oral B brush for years and was very happy with the Oral B Pro White Head but they did not have them at the store so I bought this one, the Oral B Floss Action. When I looked at it I thought it would not clean good in the corners of the teeth since the round brush is not fully round but I said to myself, ""oh, it should work."" I figured I would not know for a few months. Well several months later and I was right. My teeth have dirty spots on them in the crevice corners and this never happened before. They should discontinue this brand. It does not work. I floss everyday with normal floss, a toothbrush cannot do that. I need to get a cleaning from dentist now and will order the Oral B Pro White Head again."
3,Oral B Floss Action 3 pack brush head refill,"I should have ordered the soft brush heads, but I am satisfied with what I have. I think if you like stiff bristles you would like these. LE"
5,Brush your teeth,"Can you believe how expensive the refills are for electric toothbrushes, but I am hooked on the electric kind. Do you suppose they could adopt the same philosophy as printer manufacturers? Make the handle inexpensive and the replacement head cost a lot. But, both are expensive. No wonder there are counterfeits."
4,FINALLY FOUND THEM,I could not find these in stores and now I have a source. Bought six so as not to run out since they are so hard to find. Does an excellent job and will never go back to manual brushing again. I like the floss action which is better than the regular heads. A little hard though.
5,dedicated to great dental care,if you want to really take good care of your teeth and gums ... invest in this simple little gadget!!! what a difference it has made with my doctor's report
5,The best brushheads for Oral-B Triumph Electric Toothbrush,"Oral B Triumph FlossAction Power Toothbrush Refills (3 Count)The best brush heads for Oral-B 9000 Serie. Fast shipping, low price, completely satisfied."
2,i'm sticking to my regular toothbrush,I honestly don't know what the big deal is with these electrics. I just bought these refills for my oralB electric. I find that it really beats down on my teath and the brush seems very stiff and small. I cant really aim properly because of all the vibration and my gums get sore. i used it once or twice and just cant handle it.I've always used a regular toothbrush and floss and i'm sticking to that. i have much more control. my hygenist actually asked me if i used an electric because she didnt see much tartar. i'm doing fine without the electric.
3,Good Product,"Good product as I want, but the USPS shipped the item that you never belive, 10 days from the shipping day... My God..what kind of service in our own land."
2,Does NOT get in between teeth. Should rename.,"I have both Oral B Vitality Dual Clean & Oral B Vitality Sonic. The Sonic & Dual Clean Vitality brush heads DO get in between teeth. They are like using a flat head manual toothbrush THAT DO CLEAN your teeth well.THE FLOSS ACTION IS POINTLESS, since it WON'T get in between your teeth.The top of the brush head sticks out/ too long in depth. It hits our teeth when brushing in an average way; be prepared to open wide to avoid the tooth hitting. DON'T forget to floss separately."
2,Oralb flossaction brush heads,"If you have used the precision clean brush heads, then this may apply. The brush head is not as gentle and doesn't appear to clean any better. The brush head is oval and it rattles against my teeth, which I find uncomfortable. I made the mistake of buying a multi-pack. Suggest you try a single brush head before you commit to the hype. In this case newer was not better!"
3,One of the heads did not spin.,I purchased an Oral B Floss action3 pack brush head refill pack and one of the heads did not rotate and could not be used. I believe it was a manufacturing problem. I have been using Oral B for several years and never had a head not work before.
5,Best value any where on the Oral B Floss refills!,"Wow, I looked high and low for the refills to my Oral B Floss at my local drug store and other well known stores, as well as online stores, but could not find the this brand or the price was too high!!! Thanks to Amazon automatic shipping, I will never be without my Oral B refills."
1,Garbage,Crap product. In 1 month I went through 2 brush heads. Real ones lasts for months. Spend the Xtra $.
2,Not for Tender Teeth,"The advertised ""floss action"" comes at the expense of somewhat rough treatment. I subsequently purchased the Oral B Sensitive brush heads and found them to be much more comfortable."
3,Ok. May not purchase again.,"Shipping - The order was delivered in expected time frame.Product - I got a different package than expected, but the product inside looked the same. I have been using the brush for a few days and I have a doubt whether it is original. The quality of the brush head is not the same as the ones that came with the original brush."
3,Works well but not worth the money they cost today.,"We've had ours for over ten years now and it still works great. The only problem is that the brush heads keep going up and up. The last time I purchased some they were $13.47 for the three pack, and I bought a bunch of them. If they go up anymore, we're going to have to find some another alternitive instead after we run out of brush heads. which will be very soon. Like going back to using a regular toothbrush instead of these or something else! It's just not worth paying over $6 a brush head anymore for them. They don't work that well! I would try and find something less expensive that works just as well or better no matter if it's a manual or electric toothbrush."
1,Not Satisfied,Not happy with replacement brusheads. Heads began to get loose after a month and then fell off completely. Same thing happened on both brushes. Original brushes never broke off. Originals were not floss action.
1,definitely knockoffs,"we've bought these type of brush heads many times and they are great. but we have never bought them from this dealer and never will again. they are terrible!!! first of all, they do not fit right...they are loose not only where the head attaches to the brush, but the brushhead itself is also very loose, and all 3 of them eventually lost the little screws in them and they fell off in our mouths while we were brushing. I will NEVER buy these from amazon again...when I tried to contact the seller, I got an email back saying they are just the distributer and can't do anything about it.stay away!!!"
5,Mine seem to be genuine,"I ordered this product from Amazon this week. From what I can tell by inspecting them they appear to be genuine - there is no dye bleed, they have two rings, serial numbers are there, etc. (I appreciate all the pictures that have been added to show the differences between the real ones and the frauds!)"
3,Does the trick,"These heads clean just fine but I prefer the Precision Clean or Pro White heads. I'm not sure that I get the ""Floss Action"" feeling from these heads. They just seem to lose the toothpaste easier more than anything."
2,Questionable product,"The packaging for this product was very questionable, making me question if this is a real Oral-B product or some knock off. For the price I paid, I wouldn't be surprised if this was some type of knock off. This product seems flimsy, but has lasted longer than the other brushheads I have purchased, so I would consider buying again so long as the price is right."
1,Beware of the fakes!,"This product is a cheap knock-off - not worth the money. The bristles are too stiff and the whole assembly doesn't even snap in place as it should. Frequently, the brush head would slip off the top of the main unit and remain in my mouth. Approx. two month after this purchase, I gave up and went to the local Wal-Mart to buy the real thing (made in Germany) for $10 more."
1,Braun toothbrush heads,"Just read some of the reviews (should have before I purchased). My ""new"" toothbrush heads did not feel right (used for about a week) -- now I read the reviews! At first I thought they were fake -- now I know! Oh well, live and learn."
4,Genuine Replacement Brushheads,"I was a little worried to buy these based on other reviews, but I received genuine Oral-B replacement heads. The brush-heads work great. I just wish they were a little cheaper."
5,Great product,These refills arrived quickly and excellent quality. They are long-lasting and get your teeth clean. They keep the gums healthy too.
5,Received quickly and in good condition,I have been using these Floss Action brushheads for a couple of years and really like the way that they clean my teeth. Using them has greatly improved my check-ups at the dentist and I find that they are easy to manuever and aren't rough on my teeth/gums.I was glad to find refills available inexpensively on Amazon and I received it within a couple of days. Thanks Amazon!
5,Best brushes ever!,My teeth are so much cleaner and in much better shape since I started using these brush heads. I don't know how the brush does it but they are great and much better than the standard brush heads.
1,BEWARE,This is not a genuine product manufactured by Braun. This is a cheaply made imitation. Do not waste your money. You will not receive what is pictured in the description!
1,Amazon sent me a Fake !!!!,"At first i could not figure out why this didn't fit properly and kept falling off, immediately i noticed that they looked cheaper than the ones that came with my professional care 4000 but i just could not believe they were not genuine since im buying from what i consider to be a very reputable seller (Amazon), After doing research i realized Amazon sent me a fake product, the item i received does not have a serial number in the back, look at this pictures in this listing to see what i mean, i will notify amazon and i am sure they will help like always, i will still love Amazon as long as they fix their mistakes."
1,Knock-Offs,"I bought directly from amazon, not a 3rd party seller, hoping that amazon would send me genuine Oral B brush heads. These are not genuine Oral B Floss Action brush heads, they are cheap knock offs as alot of the reviews are pointing out. The brush head falls off the handle instead of snapping on like the genuine ones do. The brush dosent even make the same noise as it does with a genuine head, it sounds more rattly. I've been reading that these heads fall apart in your mouth while brushing so I'm returning mine before they have a chance to do that. Check out the pictures with the notes at the top of the page, the brush heads amazon sent me look identical the the knock-off ones. (Grey oral-b markings etc.)"
1,I don't understand,I first purchased this from a marketplace reseller. It's counterfeit. Fine. I would just return and purchase it from Amazon itself. Again it's counterfeit.I don't understand why Oral-B is still listing Amazon as sort of a recommended reseller on their website. Everyone who bought counterfeit here should complain to Oral-B and push them to take action on this stupid counterfeit madness.
1,CounterFeit Product,"Today, Oct 6th, after 2 of the 3 brush heads broke I called Oral-B Braun. They had me perform the ""scratch test"". If you use a dime, and scratch off the gray Oral-B label, it is a counterfeit. Very disappointed to find my purchase was a scam. Buyer be ware.Vendor: Trend Marketing. Please assess your purchases and vendors to ensure your customer protection."
1,Cheap imposter - not Oral B made,"I really like and highly recommend this floss/action attachment from Oral B - HOWEVER, I purchased this product on Amazon and I do believe it was a KNOCK-OFF and not made by Oral B. I read other reviews warning about unknowingly purchasing a knock-off, and then it happened to me. After only a month of use, the head became very wobbly and seemed to start to detaching. It broke off, falling into my hand, as I was very gently trying to inspect it to see what was wrong. I hate paying retail for these, but I went back to biting the bullet on price to make sure I bought the real deal. I am happy I did. Make sure you buy the ones made by Oral B. You will like them. I have been using them for at least 4 years and let me tell you, the dental hygenist spends a lot less time in my mouth - and doesn't have to scrape and dig around the gumline so much anymore. (Perhaps the price of the real ones is worth that alone!!)"
1,Defective Oral B Floss Action brush head refills,The brush heads broke after two weeks of use and pinched my husband's lip. I returned the unopened brushes and never received a refund. DO NOT order from Direct Super Center.
5,Fantastic!,"I love this toothbrush head! It took some time to get use to, but well worth the effort. Recently had a cleening and I hardly had any plaque buildup. Previous gum issues that I was having are now all resolved. The hygenist even commented that I must be flossing better, which I haven't been at all. My teeth feel like I have had a cleaning everyday!I highly recommend this toothbrush head for everyone. I will never go back to manuel brushing."
4,Work as advertised!,These brush heads are effective -- they get in tight spots and remove even the toughest deposits. They last a long time too.
3,Different from picture,Item received was different from product picture. Picture show a 4 pc but item is 3 pc. Inaccurate description of product.
4,satisfied customer,everything was as I orded and arrived on time and I would recommend these producs to anyone who is interested.
5,Oral B Floss Action,This product was as described and I have been very pleased with it's performance. I would certainly recommend it to anyone.
5,Very Happy,I purchased these toothbrush replacements for my Braun and my husband liked them much better than the original replacements. Very Happy!!
4,Good but a little hard,"We like the Floss Action brush heads for our family's Oral B brushes but these arre a little stiff for the children. They need softer brush heads. My husband and I like the Floss Action quite a bit though, our teeth certainly seem cleaner over the traditional rounder ones."
1,raised price on subscribed price,"I subscribed this item, and received a %15 off discount. They raised the price after a few shipments. I just found out today, and i will no longer trust Amazon.com"
3,Too harsh on the gums,"I'm sure these are great for some people. For the rest of us with sensitive gums, don't buy them! I thought I didn't have sensitive gums....so I didn't heed the warning, so I bought them and after using them for a couple of days, I had to stop. Just buy the precision ones."
3,Good but not sure about floss action,Heads work great with the Oral B electric toothbrush but for regular use only. The floss action is not that great.
5,Oral B Floss Action 3 pack brush head refill,I had earlier purchased the Oral B Triump electric toothbrush from Amazon and our family really likes it.The replacement brush heads were the cheapest at Amazon. The delivery time was great also.

5,Great little knife,It's a great little knife. Fits in my pocket well. I'm a computer tech and I use it for lots of different things including opening boxes. No complaints.
2,Very Small...twss,"This knife is very small and is not of the same quality that gerber holds other knives to. I have a lot of knives, so I know a thing or two about them. About the only thing this knife is good for is opening mail and boxes. It is way to small to do anything else. Had I known how small it was, I would not have purchased it. Since I had it I decided to try and get some use out of it. I found that the blade did not hold an edge very well, and it is not very easy to put an edge back on it. If you are looking for a knife to use occasionally for extremely light duty tasks, you may like this knife, but I would also recommend checking outVictorinox Swiss Army Classic Pocket Knife, which will accomplish everything this knife can but also has a couple other tools on it. The steel used in the Victorinox is better and will resharpen more easily."
4,Durable too.,"Others have mentioned the light weight and sharpness of this knife out of the box, and I agree. I also find it takes a really nice edge using my little ""Smiths"" pocket ceramic sharpener.Smith Abrasives, Inc. PP1 Pocket Pal Knife SharpenerOn top of that, it's also a tough little bugger. I dropped mine (closed) today. It then got run over by a heavy industrial cart and it flew about 6 feet across a rough concrete surface. Not a scratch."
5,awesome pocket knife,"perfect everyday pocket knife. Small, light and no sharp corners to wear out your pockets. Love this as an every day knife. Bought 2 so I could have one for work and one for home!"
3,PoCKET Knife,"The pic is deceiving, This knife is less than 2"" long. Pricey for such a small knife, but a Gerber. Gave it to my wife for her purse. Read the measurements before purchase."
3,Gerber Knife,Nice little Gerber but too small to do much. Sharpens easily but does not hold edge well.
3,Office Worker,"Great light weight knife to carry around everyday to the office to open envelopes, boxing tape, etc. Poor quality, but lightweight blade. Emphasis on lightweight."
2,broke after one week of light use,I used it to cut some twine and some cheese while camping. The lock malfunctioned without me knowing it and cut my friend while he was cutting cheese.
5,good keychain knife,"This is a very good knife for ten bucks. I keep it on my key chain and use it for simple jobs like opening boxes or cutting string, wire, bags, etc. The knife handle is well built and durable despite being made plastic. The blade is less impressive however. It seems to be of lesser quality and it dulls easily but at least it still does the job. It is 2.5 inches closed which makes it ideal for key chains. Also it will not open up in your pocket by accident do to its design. My other kershaw knife has an auto open feature that is dangerous when in a pocket so i dont use it as much even though it is a superior knife. i like this knife do to its small size, ease of use, and that its safe to keep in your pocket but i wish it had a better blade. overall a good deal."
5,Gerber LST,"The Gerber LST ultralight lock blade has been a constant companion of mine since first acquiring it in the 1980s, and hardly a day goes by when I don't use it for something. It holds an edge for a long time, and when it gets dull, and a few swipes on a steel no longer brings it back to razor sharpness, just a few minutes work with a wet stone, followed by a few swipes on a compound loaded leather strop, and it's back to shaving sharp, and I mean that literally, as I test it by shaving off a patch of arm hair.Structurally, it's still perfect, too. Needless to say, I'm impressed. That's close to thirty years of nearly daily service from a lightweight folder, and still going strong."
4,Gerber - you get more than you pay for,Good small knife for the business guy or gal who needs a tool for most of the small jobs.
2,Faith on the Line,"The problems Colson addresss are those that fundamentally effect not only our country, but any civilized society. While both precise & strong in its brevity, this book serves as an overview of the issues. Colson writes to show us the problem is not only within society, but also within the Church itself. Overall, the delivery is simple, yet challenging. ""Faith on the Line"" is more than a title, it is a call to action. How many of us truly put our faith on the line? How many are ready to 'dare to be different, dare to be Christian""?"
4,Album Track Listing,The songs on the album are:1. Summer Beach2. Shiroi Kai no Brooch3. Sailing4. Naive5. Cherry Blossom6. Anata no Tegami7. Je T'aime8. Natsu no Tobira9. Hanabira10. Ai no Shinwa
5,Plush Chipmunk,"After searching the internet for chipmunk toys, I was very excited to find one that wasn't a cartoon character, but an actual chipmunk facsimile."
5,so soft,Cute and cuddly but did come with a hole along one of the seams. It was easy enough to fix on our own.
5,"plush toys for girls is a great gift idea, haha","the plush chipmunk is a fantastic gift. the product was very soft and enjoyable to hold and is durable for being dropped or thrown around. and girls like it, so there's no downside there :)"
5,perfect :),"Just as pictured, extra soft, and noise-free! My little guy has been sleeping with his new chipmunk every night since Santa brought it!"
4,Awesome idea!,"At the beginning this book was sort of like Ender's Game with Jason's adventures in Capitol. A very different Sci-fi story. I think every Card book revolutanizes science fiction. A lot of ideas about humanity that people won't want to admit. The only thing I didn't like about this book was the way it was set up by a bunch of short stories. But now that I think about it, there wasn't a much better way he could have written it. Card prevails again!"
3,Heavy handed,"While Card is, as usual, a master of plot development and vivid action scenes, the heavy-handed morality in this book clouded my enjoyment of the story. Much effort was made to make the antagonists blatantly evil, complete with racism and sexual depravity. There's also a fundamentally pessimistic view of humanity: it seemed he was trying to make a point through analogy that when people are safe and confident that they can fulfill their basic needs, they always become immoral and decadent, while people constantly surrounded by pain and suffering are always good."
3,Overworked,"This book had some real potential. If Card had stopped with the first story thread, it would have been fine. A little preachy, but a gripping read.But this book is apparently a rework of some of his short stories and when Card couldn't work them all into the theme, he glued them in at the back as ""other perspectives"". For me, it failed. I found it confusing and pointless. Not nearly as much fun to read.If you knead bread for too long, it just doesn't come out right. Card had all the right ingredients, but he just worked this too much."
2,The not entirely Worthless Saga,"I am just about done with this book and I did not like it at all. The shorts about the world of Capitol were the most interesting, but the bulk of the book regarding Jason Worthing, Justice and Lared is just way to shallow, simple and uninteresting that I had to struggle to finish that part. The blatant religious undertones are disturbing, even though Card tries to couch them in somewhat secular ideas.Card seems to have not bothered to develop the individual characters, instead opting for a papier mache cast of cardboard cutouts to promote his thin plot. Moral lessons in a work of fiction are fine, but at least make the vehicle something that makes you want to get in a drive!Card amazed me with Ender and Speaker for the Dead. I have been searching for another Card series to keep me entertained, but so far, much of his other work has left me dry."
4,Worth a read,"I first discovered Orson Scott Card as did most everyone else, reading Enders Game, in fact one of my top ten books is its sequel Speaker for the Dead. The Worthing Saga is Card's very first story he wrote. It demonstrates his promise as an author. While he acknowledges that he afterwards rewrote the entire tale, the basic plot and premise remained. One thing that I enjoy about Scott novel's is how he creates a moral dilemma, often through tension of a desired ideal, and the consequences of faulty execution. This story spans thousands of years and follows the diaspora of the human race among the stars, the scientific miracle of living ""forever"" and the power to save that developed in the progeny of Jason Worthing. The dilemma centers on the age old question of suffering; why we suffer, what if you could prevent suffering and some of the possible consequences of eliminating suffering."
5,The Best of the Best!,"They don't come any better than this...this book contains so many truths about humanity that we don't want to deal with. After you read it you will never see society in the same way again.. Or religion for that matter. The book contains the most obvious truth that most Christian writers of this day and age ignore... we endure suffering NOT so we can go to heaven, but because without suffering there can be no joy - they are flip sides of the same coin. Pain is the finest gift a God can give..without it we never reach our potential."
4,Worth the effort.,"This was a tough read for me. I tend to deplore short stories and was disappointed at the short-stories-cobbled-into-a-book feel. However, I have to agree with some of the other reviewers here that the message is simply the best answer to the question of how a good God could allow evil and pain to exist on earth that I have ever seen. Highly recommended."
4,Some of Card's earlier work shows where his talent came from,"Anyone who is interested in the works of Orson Scott Card must read this book! The Worthing Saga is actually a collection of stories, some of which began when Card was a teenager! First, there is The Worthing Chronical, which is the most recent and complete story of Jason Worthing. Then read tales of Capitol, unrelated stories that all took place on the planet Capitol, providing basis for parts of The Worthing Chronical. Then read Worthing Farm, Worthing Inn, and Tinker, three of the earliest short stories that tell of the decendants of Jason Worthing, men and women with unusual psychic abilities that must be used for good or evil"
2,I'm still not sure,"I like Card's Ender series but I'm still not sure about this one. Everyone speaks in such a weird dialect in the beginning. Also, I kind of think Orson Scott Card is a giant, greasy wiener in person so that may sway my opinion a little."
5,Orientation for when you next experience physical death,"The case histories of people remembering past lives are fascinating, but what I like the most about the book is ""The Phenomena of Death"", a 12-page dissertation on the facts of physical body death and what really happens to YOU as a spirit, when your body dies. This gives the real information any human would want to have in approaching their own physical body death and answers the important and frightening questions about death in a direct way. I also like the ""Historial Sketch of Reincarnation and past lives"". This shows historically when the Catholic Church stopped believing in past lives (553 AD)."
2,Huh?,"This is the only collection of actual case histories and studies available within Scientology. It is truly a bizarre piece of work. The ""benefits"" most people in the book claim to have from auditing past lives do not have follow-up stories; and besides, I don't see notes saying, ""After auditing, this person went on to get a $2 an hour raise and his cancer went into remission and his children all began getting straight A's..."" etc. On the other hand, though the stories are bizarre, they're good fodder for sci-fi writers; just throw out the less credible or usable ideas."
4,Not for the faint of heart.,"This was a very interesting look at the subject of past lives and the Human Spirit. But it is a very frank and clinical look at the subject. One may wish to attempt some of the more basic books on the subject of Scientology before attempting this one! But if you are bold and looking for an adventure, read on!"
2,Not very interesting,"I found this book very boring, It didn't even attempt to convince me of past lives, and I'm open to the idea. The writing style is very very boring, the 'cases' that are shown here are not all interesting, and some are just random. There are other more interesting books on the idea of past lives. I don't think LRH wrote this book, someone else must have compiled it using instructions or something. It doesn't have any flow or anything, its just case after case after case. I have talked to so many people that rave about how great this book is, I don't know why they enjoyed it so much. (and I did clear my words)"
2,not thrilled,"Actually, I have the ""master"" phone and 2 other handsets that came with it. Immediately after purchasing the first phones I was pleased and purchased the last handset for the guest room. That was over a year ago and I have to say that now I'm not happy with any of the phones. Too much static in the lines, the range is not at all good (if I go to the patio, with the receiver in the kitchen about 10 feet away,the person on the other end can't hear me), and I can hear the main line buzzing all the time. I wouldn't purchase the set, or the additional handset, again."
2,"Phone handset from Thomson, Ind","I have purchased 4 handsets for this phone base. 2 have worked as designed. One had a poor LCD display for caller ID, but I kept it anyway. The second was impossible to use. The phone transmitter did not work at all. I had it completely hooked up with phone numbers added to the memory. Then one the first call, I discovered that the person on the other end could not hear me. Trying to return it to Thomson, Inc was futile. The address I had in Texas was no longer valid. To pay shipping charges to Canada will end up costing more than the item. 50% quality assurance is definitely below acceptable standards."
4,4 are better than one...,"We bought the 3rd and 4th phone of a set of 4, delivery was rapid. We are happy with the phones, can move all but the base anywhere there is AC power, no phone line connection needed except for the base unit. We are using the phones on a Cox cable connection. Sound is excellent, especially compared to our Nokia cell phone on AT&T."
1,Awful,"These phones were dreadful, in pretty much every way. If the stuff GE makes for the military is as bad as these phones, we're screwed."
5,GE Interference Free Phone,This is the phone to have if you want interference free talking. It does not interfere with my wireless internet and you can be on more than 1 at a time. Very clear sound and trouble free.
4,"Accessory handet ok, base station faulty","The accessory handsets work fine, but I had to exchange the base. The first one had static and a faulty LED display.The second one seems to work fine."
1,Too quiet,"I purchased this phone as an extra to use with my current phone system. I am comparing it directly with the one I already have, & it does not compare. I don't know why it would be different, but it is. it's not loud enough even with the volume all the way up. Also, when you plug in the earpiece, it sounds terrible. The earpiece sounds perfect with my current phone. Very Strange, since they are the same phone."
2,work well for a short time,"dont waste your money on these. we bought them because they were economical and looked nice. we rarely use our house phone and only 3 years later, all 3 phones have unreadable displays and we are now replacing the batteries since none of them hold a charge anymore. wish we would ahve spent more money upfront and saved ourselves the headache of hacing to spend money on phones we use so rarely."
3,Good looking but not good sounding,"I have the same issue as one of the other reviewers. I have 2 of these handsets. One of them sounds ok. The other always has some sort of static in the background. With this unit, it is never easy to understand what the other person is saying.Looks wise this phone is awesome - that why I bought it in the first place. Sound wise its ok."
4,Just as described.,Good product. Unfortunately through my fault alone I had to send it back. It was one more handset than the base unit would allow. No problems on the return.
3,"Too much ""Buzzing""","I have had this phone for almost a year. At first I was extremely happy with it but I now need to replace it. I work from home and use the phone 4+ hours a day so I may just have ""overused"" it. However, I can hardly hear people due to a buzzing noise in the background. I hear it more than the people on the other end (they say it is a faint buzzing)."
4,Ge Handset--Works great,This item linked well with my already present GE handsets. Would consider buying more when needed.
1,Waste of Money,"I was excited when it came ,thinking that I saved money, because a lot cheaper then Walmart, but to my disappointment, it did not work as I expected no ink came out, it was just light grey , so I called the seller and they sent me a replacement, still the same result, so I ended up getting a refund!!"
1,Junk,Put this new cartridge in the printer and it printed a light brown for about 8 pages then nothing. I think they filled it with water!!!!
3,Works but not as dark as usual.,I've used the same ink for a couple years. Even with a normal setting this ink comes out very very light. I'm not sure if the brand has changed or if it's just this cartridge I received.
4,they are making good,I recently purchased this item and the product was of poor quality. It was not properly filled with ink. They have made it right by sending out an another product. Thank you for making this right.
1,X2480 - does not workj,"I have a Lexmark X2480 printer.warning, does not work with X2480 printer even though the printer test says it does.....beware if this is your printer."
2,did not work in my lexmark x2480,"This product would not work in my lexmark x2480 all in one printer, i'm sure it's a good product just not for my printer."
3,wrong item,"if ordering this product make sure it is the exact match for your printer, i used the tool on here to see & it said this item would work for my printer but it did not. Do not trust that the tool on the item page says that it will work."
1,Will not work for Lexmark X3430,"I ordered this item for my Lexmark X3430 printer because the selection tool provided by Amazon designated it as what I needed. THAT TOOL IS NOT ACCURATE in this instance. It does not work. It may be an outstanding ink cartridge for another printer, but not for mine. Sorry to post review of Amazon's selection tool instead of cartridge itself, but need to warn other users."
3,"Does the job, but . . .",Does the job but would never do it again. I bought this printer quickly when my last one broke. Would never buy a printer without separate color & black cartridges again. This is ALWAYS low and when I tried to buy a refilled one it wouldn't recognize it. That was $15 down the drain.
3,Acceptable value for a low price,"If you are looking for acceptable quality prints at a low price, this cartridge is fine. Does not last for many prints though."
1,I'm stuck buying these until I get a better printer,"Now I know why the printer was so cheap..these cartridges don't last long at all, and don't print strong at all..images are light and weak. Lousy cartridges but you get what you pay for, I guess."
1,"It looks useful, but only from a distance","This tool will not take an edge, either with a grinder or a file. It is very flexible so that the energy of a blow goes into flexing the blade rather than cutting stems, which has undesirable consequences for your hand. If you are looking for a useful tool, keep looking."
1,In No Way Can This Be Considered A Cutting Tool,"I bought this so my son could have a cheap machete.It is cheap but it is not a machete. This is a dangerous piece of flimsy metal designed to injure the wielder. Plants laugh at this pathetic impostor and I highly recommend you never look at this page again.I'm serious... I took one swing with this thing and knew I would never use it. It has no balance, no feel, no blade, and I could break it if I wanted to.For your own good click the 'back button' on your browser and step away from this ""machete""."
1,cannot hold an edge,"i have had this knife professionally sharpened a few times, and it cannot hold an edge for more than 2 or 3 cuts. it is like trying to beat down the vegetation. makes almost no difference which side of the machete you use to cut with, it is so terrible. a complete waste of money, material, not even worth the packaging it is wrapped in. shame on Coleman."
1,not for wood,"terrible machete.Had one,and it bent in half when trying to chop a sappling.Hit the blade against a colombian machete,and the coleman had a big cut into it,and the real machete was almost perfect."
3,made for cutting down brush,i bought this machete from walmart for $7.00 not made for cutting down big trees just small brush the sheath is very nice but the handle will break in one spots after hitting a huge tree two many times i would reccamend buying a gerber macheteor an ontario.
5,I got mine from the flea market,"When I first got this (at the flea market it was only 5$), I went to my woods and cut down some about 5 inch trees easily with 10-20 hacks!It is perfect because its thin, light, and durable. gets stained easily, but you can clean it. The only bad thing (it really didnt bother me that much) was that the handle cracked, but scince it had screws i took it off easily. Then i simply used some duct tape to replace the handle and it worked just great! I would definatley recommend this."
2,Not worth it,"It is a very heavy lamp. It is hard to assemble. If you are a single woman, passs it. Besides, the lights are not bright enough to read. Not worth it."
1,nightmare,"Absolute nightmare! the packaging box was is horrible shape, the middle portion was ripped and repaired by ducktape. I didn't remove the items of fear of broken pieces. The pieces that were visible were of poor quality. This was an absolute disappointment! I wish I could give negative stars!"
2,NOT HAPPY,"When I initially purchased this light I liked the look of it in my living room. However, when trying to change bulbs needed a ladder. Also, the shades kept turning so facing the ceiling. When trying to tighten the shades one came off and could not get it to stay on. Out of the five shades, three are facing the ceiling. Shall try to fix it again and put it in a garage sale."
1,not as advertised,"this lamp is not as advertised. product description plainly states ""Uses standard 40-watt bulb (not included)"" BUT actually uses socket 14 candle type lamps.i did not notice untill i paid someone 20.00 bucks to assembly for me. will return but still will be out the 20. bucks."
4,Cool light,This thing is a beast and looks so nice. I used this for over a year and when I moved I had no issue selling it for next to what I purchased it for. Solid design overall but seems to scratch easily. Love the dimmer on it and looks amazing behind a sectional. The bulbs can get very bright lighting up a room with no issue at all and can be dimmed so low it's just mood lighting. I have attached a customer photo to help you see how it looks.4 stars only because of the scratch factor out of the box. If you do get it in black a black Sharpie is your best friend.
5,Absolutely Perfect For My Use,I placed this fixture between two couches and it perfectly illuminates both. It wasn't too difficult to put together and came with the bulbs. I love the fact that it has a dimmer switch which allows me to control most of the lighting in the room from one point. The bulb covers have slats that allow light to be shown on the ceiling which is a nice touch also. It's a pretty cool lighting device.
4,Very nice lamp,We love the lanp it really gives nice light in our living room the candle base bulbs are fine and the dimmer feature makes tge lanp even nore functional.
2,defective and missing parts,"The package came torn up. While assemling, I was by myself, I realize several parts were missing and one of the archs were broken. I could not fix it. So dissappointed, this is a beautiful lamp, but was defective. I wrote to the sellers."
1,Broke during assembly,"We had a problem identical to another reviewer -- the base plate in the pole is welded to the pole in 4 small spots. This plate is critical for securing the pole to the base. Upon standing the pole upright, the base plate broke at all 4 weld points causing the pole to collapse. At least this happened during assembly. If it had happened while the lamp was in use, someone could have been injured."
3,nice lamp,"Took a gamble on this after reading other reviews. I got lucky because my box came in decent condition. A little banged up but no holes or tears. The lamp itself had all the pieces and no scratches on the metal. The only bad part was the base. It was really dirty and even after cleaning has a permanent ""dusty"" look to it. It's not really a big deal to me as i have the lamp hidden behind my couch. You cant beat the price and overall I'm happy with my purchase."
2,Cheap looking,"Received this yesterday and frankly find it quite disappointing. It looks a lot cheaper than the picture. The metal looks crudely machined, and the most disappointing part was the base. The base looks like it was made of concrete and had a layer of plastic painted on. Honestly, i would value this item at around $75. Nothing more."
1,bad lamp,"This lamp came with packaging damaged and not all parts were there. Tried to get them to send missing parts but was told I would have to repackage and send back, what a hassle!!"
1,Extremely poor quality,Ordering this junk was a complete waste of time. The base-plate is attached to the shaft with 4 tiny spot-welds. Two of these welds broke immediately upon standing the unit upright... which meant it would not stand at all. Assembly (and disassembly/repacking for return) was a waste of two hours. Completely useless.
4,Great Lamp,"Beware... this lamp is huge! You'll need the ceiling for it. I was going to send it back because it didn't work for it's intended purchase reason... but because it's a dimmer, it actually worked great in the home office. I turned the lights toward he ceiling, and voila, great over the shoulder mood lighting and conversation piece! We call it the HYDRA lamp."
5,Great,"Wasn't gonna order this lamp cause of all the bad reviews but come to find out it was just the way I expected... no scratches, nothing broke and box wasn't great but wasn't beat up, or maybe the U.P.S. just took better care of mine... but know problem here"
4,Lamp,Decent value for the price. Comes with no instructions so takes quite some time to figure out how to assemble.
3,Defective,"Funtionally the lamp fits our needs. However, when we took it out of the box the electrical cord was in two pieces. We had to splice it together and wrap with electrical tape. The product was defective."
4,"GREAT lamp, with only one problem...","I am VERY pleased with this purchase. The assembly was challenging, as other reviewers have said, but with two of us, no problem. The fit and finish was very good. Candelabra bulbs are readily available, but my one little nit to pick: I would rather the light be brighter white. I've replaced the original bulbs with xenon and am pleased with the light color now."
1,Don't buy this lamp!,"This lamp was purchased as a gift for my son-in-law. It was received in a box that was damaged. The arms were broken and not usable. We have been working with this company since the end of December, and they are terrible to deal with-don't answer their telephone, slow to respons.... We asked for a refund and they sent us a replacement set of arms. When we assembled the lamp, it was a foot higher than described in Amazon (actually was 96""). Does not fit in any room of our house. Amazon was just about as useless in trying to resolve this issue. After 7 calls to Amazon and a claim with Amazon, we are still trying to return this item and get a refund. Terrible experience!"
4,Really High Up,"Overall, quite a nice piece. However it is very ""tall"" and arms are not bend-able. As such, this floor lamp will not work as a reading lamp. But again it looks nice."
4,"Nice lamp, BAD packaging","The lamp came in a broken box, although it said FRAGILE on it!!!! The quality of the paint on lamp is not very impressive. I really like the lamp and that is why I spent $100 on it but the quality does not match the price."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!,pRODUCT IS HORRIBLE MADE. I'VE PURCHASED BETTER AT WALMART. CHECK OTHER REVIEWS. THE MAIN STABILITY FOR THE WHOLE LAMP IS HELD TOGETHER BY 4 SPOT WELDS...........THEY BROKE IMMEDIATELY AS I ATTATCHED THE LAMP TO THE BASE.
1,Multiple Return/Resold Item,"Ore International 5 Arm Arch Floor Lamp - BlackThis item arrived in packaging that appeared to have been around the world a couple times - 1/3 of package held together with packing tape and the electrical connection for the lamp was protruding from the other end of the package. Fortunately all the parts were there but required washing since they were filthy. The lamp obviously had been sold before and returned since the electrical connection had been taped together with electrical tape and the bracket at the bottom of the pole that attaches to the base had all four welds broken. My husband felt it would be more hassle for me to return the item than for him to repair it - ""you'd probably get a replacement lamp in worse shape"". The repaired lamp now looks and works as described in the product literature."
5,Lamp!,"I am pleased with this product, although it is extremely large. the arms are little flimsy, and the height is taller than expected. i LOVE the fact this lamp has a dial instead of just an on/ off switch. the lamp also gives off heat making it a mini heater in the winter. one complaint, one of the light bulb attachments was broken when i recieved this."
5,great lamp,I bought a black spider lamp off of amazon and it works great!! It's switch offers a dimmer option which is wonderful.
2,Not a good lamp,Pros:1. Lamp worksCons:1. Damaged packaging2. Lamp is missing screws3. Lamp shakes a lot and is bent4. Sockets are not medium base as mentioned in the description
2,WAS BROKEN,"IT LOOKS NICE, BUT WHEN WE RECEIVED IT, THE BASE WAS BROKEN.. WE HAVE IT COVERED, BUT IT CANNOT BE MOVED BECAUSE THE CRACK IS RIGHT THROUGH IT.. VERY DISAPPOINTING SINCE WE SPENT SO MUCH ON IT.."
3,Great method but terrible female speaker,"It is not as well designed as Pimsleur's Russian I. It assumes you know words that have never been presented and skimps on the feminine forms of verbs. But my biggest complaint is the female speaker's voice. I find it unbearable to listen to. Not only is her voice whiny, tight, and high, but she sounds angry, bored, and like she's being forced to do this. The Russian I female speaker had a beautiful voice and perfect expressiveness for enjoyable learning."
4,Good beginning Overview,"I think this was a good first book for parents about to tackle potty training. While as some have posted the author does clearly think infant training is best, other methods are also clearly presented and outlined. Use this book as a starting point. It outlines a few major methods. From this you should be able to decide which method you want to use and then focus your next book purchases."
1,Focus on infant potty training,"The author clearly believes you should train an infant and not use diapers. But then there isn't a clear plan for training a baby. This is kind of a mix of lots of ideas without a committment to one specific plan. Kind of confusing, not too helpful."
1,Waaaaaaay to much emphasis on potty training tiny infants,"The author of this book seemed to me to have a clear bias towards methods of potty training used in places in the world where people do not use diapers and thus begin potty training at a mere 2-3 months of age. If I had noticed that such a large portion of this book was devoted to 'baby-training' versus toddler training, I would not have purchased it. The small sections on toddler training weren't worth the money, as they had no more information that you could get out of any parenting magazine article on potty training."
4,"Great tool, but...","not the best for a surf fisherman. I really like the tool, and the one-handed snap-out of the pliers is really handy. Until, that is, a couple of grains of sand get in the tool. The little push-button latching mechanism does not like sand at all! For fresh water fishing this would be fine. Otherwise, I'm very happy with the overall strength and quality of the tool, and would have no problems recommending it for other use besides surf fishing."
5,It'll last a decade or more,"I bought this model to replace an earlier version of the same that I lost. I was previously in the military and had used this Gerber multitool in the field for a couple of years - it never rusted or broke. Gerber steel is very, very sharp and keeps a great edge. An excellent product."
2,-__-,"Wears out too fast. Didn't last even 2 weeks, I'd buy something that lasts longer like adidas or perhaps band wristbands. -__-"
1,Title,this guy is freaking stupid hes a gaylord liar and didnt give me bolth of them. so now ive got to go duel this pipsqueak and destroy him because i bench 70 pounds at the least
1,Biggest rip off ever!!,"They sell these wristbands for 2.49 on amazon. But you only get one band for one wrist, which is super confusing. And when you get them, two come in one package. 2.50 for a no-name brand and you only get one."
2,Do NOT buy this game!,"We bought this game for our daughter because she enjoys science. When we unwrapped it however we saw that there were definite problems with the game. The ""operating table"" was a very flimsy plastic, but that would have been okay if we just used it gently. The problem came about when we attempted to play the game. The ""guts"" don't fit into the body without a LOT of setting, re-setting, re-re-setting, etc... they just don't fit where they're supposed to. This game just served to be extremely frustrating for all of us and our daughter didn't even want to finish the first game. This game is not appropriate for children (or adults for that matter) and we would strongly advise anyone thinking of purchasing it to save themselves the time, money, and frustration! The only fun part of the game was the true or false questions that we answered without bothering with the ""guts""."
4,fact or ...?,"This collection of stories is really a collection of ingenious essays -- on narrative, fiction writing, and stories themselves -- masquerading as fiction. Witty and inventive. Great fun for grad-student aspiring fictioneers."
3,Lacking in comparison to his earlier works,"John Barth has proven his ability to create interesting, fantastical yet plausible worlds with a deft magical realism. But I found this, his most recent collection, severely lacking and even cannibalistic--there are passages repeated from earlier stories of his verbatim! A sorely disappointing collection, in comparison to his eariler works."
4,Excellent Travel Info,A wonderful introduction and overview of london. the pull-out map is a great idea and the small size makes it a very functional and portable guide. This book enhanced my trip to london immeasurably.
4,Exciting,"This book is definitely more exciting then the first book, and two new characters are introduced, Two Hawks and Swan Circling. Two Hawks is a Salish boy who becomes Kaya's friend, despite his bossy attitude. Swan Circling is a brave woman who is a main character in the third book. This book is the book where Kaya realizes her lack of responsibility, after making a huge mistake that could keep her from seeing her family, and her beautiful horse, Steps High, ever again. My only problem with this book is the ""spirit"" that Kaya comes across near the end of the book. I don't believe in ""spirits"" or ""ghosts"", and I found that part to be very unrealistic. But other than that, I would say this is a good book about struggle, and finding your way home.I would recommend it to people who read the first Kaya book. If you haven't read the first book, then I suggest that you read it before this one, because it will make this one a little bit more enjoyable."
4,The Best of Ska,"Great box set, some great classic tracks on here and to be honest not one lousy song... And I'm into Rock'A'Billy! so if you're a Ska fan you'll love this, so get out your moon boots and lets go stomping!!!"
5,"Long life, nice design","Smoke alarms aren't particularly attractive, but this one has a nice, sleek design that is less obtrusive than most. The high price is from the lithium battery which gives it 10 years of power, definitely worth it in my opinion to avoid changing the battery every couple of years. It has a nice feature that allows you to shut off the alarm for 15 minutes if it goes off because of cooking smoke or other false alarms."
3,Thought it was not working,"When I opened the package and installed the battery it started chirping like a dead battery. So, I tested the battery with a multimeter and it showed full charge. I replaced the battery back in the unit and more chirping, I was just about to pack it up to return, however, for some reason I just let it chirp about 5 minutes, then it stopped and seems to be working, so far about 4 months."
3,Lindon has too much time on her hands.,"Someone who writes a full-paragraph review of a smoke detector obviously has a lot of time on her hands. It's good to see that that she has put that free time to productive use. I've bought a lot of smoke detectors in my time, but I've never taken 10-20 minutes to write an online review of a smoke detector. Kudos to Lindon for taking that extra step to promote fire prevention."
3,Not the best statue ever...,"I picked one of these up for $20 delivered... and I wish I had my $20 back. This was produced by Corgi, who overall did an average job on their Marvel Heroes die cast statues. The Colossus body sculpt is okay, but the paint job is iffy and Colossus has a goofy looking grin on his face. Save your money, you can do better than this."
5,American Idol_Season 6_Finale Performance,"I am a huge American Idol fan. This DVD replayed the final showdown between Jordin and Blake. I loved reliving every moment. The DVD extras were also a treat. It was fun to take a peek behind the scenes, and see what goes on when the contestants aren't on the stage. I wish they would do this type of video (not just a ""best of"" or ""worst of"") for every season."
4,A little to warm for Houston weather.,The comforter is great me and my wife love it. It's a bit warm for Houston weather it never really got below 40 here more then a couple of times. Very soft and plush I haven't noticed the down shifting at all.
5,Naruto Shippudenn Box set 3,"Worth the money, action packed non stop, excellent dvd quality, no problems.When buying says Japanese as Language only. This is not true you have the option to have voice in Japanese or ENGLISH."
5,Naruto Shippuden Box Set 3 Special Edition,This set will include collectible Mininja Figurine..From what I have gathered from websites this set will include episodes 27-39.This limited edition includes a collectible mininja of Sasori and an exclusive art card. The regular one will not..Uncut and Original. A few other sites i have been to says the length of this volume is 325 Minutes
4,Stupid mistakes are easily mended,"Well, I can't believe that the box set came to me with three discs clearly and visibly labeled 8, 9, and 9. Somehow, it oddly came with two identical discs and no disc seven. But I did send it back, and they graciously covered the shipping charges and issued a refund, so I still give them four stars. :/"
5,Shippuden ROCKS!!,"Naruto , and Naruto Shppuden are both amazeing anime works of art i highly sugest them to all anime fans."
5,Happy to see my fav. character Gaara gets the box set cover.,"YES! my favorite naruto character gets the cover! Can't wait for this! I wish it came out in like june or july though. :/ but i guess they want to give time to the people that can't wait and so they'll buy the individual discs and milk it. I vote stop the single discs, this is the only way to put out anime. BOX SETS! anyways I can't wait to for it. woot! SAND TSUNAMI!!! haha."
5,One More Great Irish Artist,"My daughter brought this album back after a stint in N. Ireland where she had an opportunity to see Duke play live in Belfast. I heard the music going on in the background of our home for a couple months and decided to give it a listen myself. A year later or so later Duke Special is at the top of my playlist and not going away any time soon.Pigeon-holing Duke is a tough task. Take one part punk, a shot of vaudeville, a dram or two of pop, blend together with lush lyrics and the Belfast Symphony, top with some scary dreads and you start to get the idea.If you'd like something edgy, yet very listenable, something rich, yet outside the box and won't get old in a week (or a month), buy this album.Songs from the Deep Forest"
3,Freewheel or Freefall?,"I bought this album on the back of the wonderful track Freewheel which is quite excellent. The danger with this strategem is that you can be disapointed if you expect another 9 ""Freewheels"" on the album. What I got was a selection of ragtime songs, which is not a favourite genre of mine. I only listened to the album twice, so these impressions are just my initial ones, it reminded me in part of early Split Enz, but as with all albums I dont initially like, I will spin it every 6 months or so and see if it will grow on me. The world would be a very dull place if we all liked the same things, wouldnt it now?"
3,its a good deal,i have used it once already and for small momentos its good but i wouldnt take it to the family reunion. but its a good deal for 100
2,"Good concept, just wish it worked.","This camera was bought for me as a christmas gift last year. At the time, I was expecting my first child, and was super excited to have a seemingly easy to use video camera to record my new baby with. It's now July and I used the camera for the first time a few weeks ago. I recorded my son's first day at the beach, and his first jar of baby food, and just some other simple little videos of him. When I hooked it up to my tv with the AV cable, it looked great.The problem came when I tried to upload the videos to my computer. The camera says it comes programmed with its own software. However, my computer won't recognize the camera at all. I've tried everything. So now, all these special videos are in this tiny little camera and I can't get them off. If I can't figure something out to get my son's first videos off this camera, I will be contacting RCA.I don't suggest ANYONE buy this camera!"
5,"recorder,cheap,","I love this little gadget. It's perfect for my needs. I'm a senior and we have a lot of little programs, birthday's, activities where you just need a short amount of filming time. Its easy to handle and carry around in your pocket.(waiting for just the right moment) I find it is handy for shots to put in blogging rooms(My Space-You Tube). Just all around O.K."
4,Great but One Problem,"I love this little video cam. The only problem I have is that it will not save directly to my hard drive. It shuts down the system. The only way I can save it is by e-mailing it to myself as an attached file and saving it there. My computer is new and has adequate memory, so I am not sure why I have the problem. Tech support at RCA was not very helpful. This is a great little recorder and it would be perfect if this problem could be resolved. If anyone else has experienced this, please e-mail me at piggypo@aol.com."
3,Best for home videos; not as great for artistic films,"I bought this camera because I like to film and produce movies (just as a hobby). Overall, the camera is good; it is small, has good resolution, and easily connects to most computers. One big problem is the zoom button. I've found that once I load the videos onto my computer, I can hear the click of the zoom button when I pressed it while filming. I feel that it takes away from my movies and distracts/annoys the audience."
4,It took a long time,"18 years have gone, since Vic Vergeat and his fellows gave another sign of life in '93. In fact, he's still one of those guitar masters, that will never reach the hall of fame but is, nevertheless, a class of its own. Hate to hate is an album, which misses nothing, from soft ballads up to heavy rockers. Jump in your time machine and go back to the early 70's, when you listen to this CD!"
3,falls short of expectation,"I'm glad this book exists because there are not others like it, but I cannot give it an enthusiastic recommendation. I'm going to study nuclear engineering and I wanted to read the history of the nuclear industry. Kupp tells you a lot about the history, but it is sandwiched between the rest of Kupp's life story. If you want to read Robert William Kupp's autobiography, here it is. If you want a history of the development of nuclear power in America, read the middle third only. (If someone knows a better book, please let me know!)One last thing: This book is chock full of typos and plain bad English. It is also chopped up into little vignettes. It's not smooth reading."
2,cheaply made,"My son was so excited to recieve this... the amp and battery all worked fine and had no issues with them, however, in the first day a string broke, and then another the next day... i realize this isnt a fancy professional electric guitar, but it still wasnt cheap and shouldnt have strings snapping off everyday... disappointed and so is my son.."
5,Blues To The Max,Savoy Records was a one of the recording industry's premier blues labels & Nappy Brown was one of its premier artists. This collection traces the career of this brilliant performer.
1,K-4713 French Curve,"We bought the Kohler K-3466 toilet which came with the seat K-4713 French Curve. Like the other gentleman who purchased 3 seats, I found the thing sloppy to install and knew it was going to fail. Two weeks later the cheap plastic intrusions that the resistance pegs fit into wore loose enough to let the seat slip out of the friction intrusions and slam down on the toilet. THIS IS A PIECE OF PURE JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!! Kohler, you should really be ashamed of this cheap plastic lid and all its thin components."
2,movement,"This quick release seat, when tightly installed, can move from side to side when used and seems overpriced for this quality defect.Sorry, but I now wish I had purchased the cheaper one."
3,"Nice enough seat, but the nuts are so short",Really strange how short the nuts that accompany this seat are. Had to use nuts from prior seat as well. Other Kohler seats come with longer nuts.
3,Kohler French Curve toilet seat,"Unfortunately, I had to send the unit back to Amazon as it did not match my fixture. This was the color that Kohler recommended but it did not come close. It's a shame that Kohler changes their color tones and eliminates a match for my older fixture. Amazon's return proceedure was as smooth as silk."
1,confusion when ordering,"this toliet seat comes in two different styles...a permanent mount that fits snuggly and a ""removabe to clean"" model that is a loose fit and moves around. be careful when ordering or you will recieve the wrong product. The only model number offered is K 4713-96"
5,Super monster,The sickest cai on the market. Makes my Dakota v8 4x4 a beast. Plus it's $100 cheaper online rather than o Riley's.
2,"Review of ""Blondie in the Dough""","On a site reviewing the the ""Blondie"" movies this had 5 stars. I would give it two stars. The storyline is about the same as many of the Blondie movies: Dagwood, thinking he will receive a bonus for an upcoming business deal with a client, buys Blondie an oven. As usual, his clumsiness, loses his boss's client and causes him to lose his job. He decides to take up home study class to become a radio engineer. With no money to pay for the new oven, Blondie decides to bake and sell cookies. The plot evolves as the eccentric owner of a cookie company befriends her and helps her bake her cookies without her knowing his true identity. Dagwood's newly acquired ""radio engineer"" skills land him into more trouble with his boss's client, and the slapstick comedy and havoc continue. Blondie's eccentric friend, the cookie company's owner, ""saves the day,"" and Dagwood receives his job back plus his lost bonus."
5,Works wonderfully,"I've been using this software (and previous versions) for years. It works beautifully and, in spite of a previous reviewer's comments, can be adjusted to capture snapshots closer together. I've had to contact customer support a couple of times, at no fault of the manufacturer, and received an extremely quick response on both occasions."
3,Beware - they will continue to find ways to charge you after purchase,"I did the right thing and paid for the license on our main PC and then additional license fee for other PC's in the house. They have the option of buying it online or the CD. I used the online option nd was sent a link. But our PC crashed and we had to ""restore to factory condition"". I asked the for the link since I honestly pd for the license on this PC but was told by customer support that I m either ungrade $69.99 or pay customer support $29.99. what a rip of! I have paid for the use on all my computers. Why can't they sent the CD I paid for and I reload it myself without customer support? After 30 days you @$"
1,"Sounds good, but does not work very well.","At first, this product seems to work really well. It has many options and setting to get the exact information you want. However, if you really want to use it to monitor computer activity, it falls short. If you have it on a computer with more than one display, it only gets the primary one. It records only outgoing keystrokes for most chat application (except the main ones like MSN and Yahoo). The playback is difficult to use, jumps around, and turns out to be of little actual value as it usually missing the needed view. It also appears to cause a hit on system performance and definitely requires a lot of disk space. eBlaster is a better application; however, it too can be fooled pretty easily."
1,Only 72 hours Warranty,"I bought the Spectorsoft Spector Pro 5.0 and installed it on three computers in my home. No where on the box did it indicate a license restriction. In less than a week I received an e-mail from Louis@spectorsoft.com that I would have to pay them another $139.00 or they would disable the software on all computers I installed it on. Since I paid $100 for the product and was not going to be forced to purchase more licenses, I removed all copies and asked them for a refund. They said I had 72 hours and would not refund the product after that. They conveniently waited for that period to expire before telling me that I had the product installed on more than one computer. Hence, I am out $100 and have no program. This program allows you to spy on people but you are the one being spied on by Spectorsoft. Also don't let them fool you into thinking you also need Eblaster, a different name for virtually the same product. You'll be spied on and robbed too! Spectorsoft is unethical."
4,Great for the kid and the price!!,"This sleeping bag is great for your teenager or child who is going to camps and occasional sleepouts. It's easy to handle and easy to pack back up. It may not last for the serious camper for an extremely rough camp, but for the money...you can't beat the quality and buy. I was very satisfied."
3,A 30 Minute DVD should not be priced at over $12.00,"This is a good DVD - a documentary - a true story that is inspiring, but it is NOT a movie. A documentary should be priced according to the time it runs (30 minutes)and it should be described as a documentary, not a movie.There are enough reviews on here that I don't understand why Amazon hasn't changed this ad and marketed it accordingly.However, the documentary itself is excellent!"
5,"Beautiful, beautiful film","This is one of those films that will make a lasting impression on the viewer. Every young person should see it, as it realistically presents the struggles that Ben Carson had to overcome. As a young black man from a single parent family, he has become the top brain surgeon in the world, and he is so humble about it that one cannot help but be thrilled that he is there, as well as be encouraged that if you or a loved one needed his gifted hands, he would not hesitate to help you, regardless of who you are or where you are from. Of great interest are the clips at the end where the actual Ben is interviewed. He mentions that the college graduation rate for young black men is 15%, and that this can be changed by discipline and hard work, as he did. Yet the film also portrays his Christian faith, unashamedly, but it is not offensive in any way; simply part of his life. He is truly gifted and an amazing person. Get ready to cry."
5,Stunning Achievement about Achievement,"In this movie I learned that Ben Carson pioneered several successful treatments for rare brain conditions. His methodologies were rare and untested at first, but now they are commonly practiced. I hope this movie has the same effect on individuals who've had a childhood similar to Ben's, that is I hope this movie will make it more common for people to triumph over difficult circumstances. Carson is one in a million, but he doesn't have to be. On top of it all, the movie was well directed and acted."
5,Inspiring,"A straight forward story told with feeling and personal warmth. Anyone should be inspired in the reading of all the obstacles this boy learned to overcome to become one of the most ""gifted"" surgeons in the country. It is an encouragement.Jolene"
3,Gifted Hands DVD's,"There are two ""Gifted Hands"" dvd's, the cheap one is a documentary, the expensive one is the movie. There's no mention of that in the description of either dvd, so I assumed the expensove one just had more outtakes, interviews, etc. and ordered the cheap one, then I had to order the other to see the movie, and for a TV movie, it was overpriced, so I feel I paid about 3 times the price of a regular movie just to watch it. It left me with a feeling of being ripped off twice."
3,Has the vibe of a hospital soap opera,Its okay as far as these made for tv drama movies go. But I have to point out that no movie version of this story seems to mention the fact that the separated Binder twins had to be institutionalized after the procedure due to brain damage suffered. Guess it wrecks the mood?
1,Never Got it!,"Sorry I can't say what a great story this movie had, but since I never got it, I can't exactly tell you anything about the movie. Just don't ever buy anything from this seller~!"
4,Inspiring Movie,This is a great movie to watch about one man's journey to motivate himself to be everything and more in life.
5,Very well told.,This is very well done. The young actors who portray the doctor are excellent. The doctor's personal trials provide an excellent foil for the medical challenge he faces.
3,Wrong Product,"This item is offered as a hardcover book, which I asked for, but comes as a dvd commentary that's supposed to support or be in conjunction with the book. The hardcopy of the book,which I ordered and asked for, would have been nice."
5,Great movie,Story is amazing. Definitely one that needs to be told to many generations...Acting was a very high standard also.JB
5,Gifted Hands: The Ben Carson Story,"Cuba Gooding Jr. stars as real-life neurosurgeon Ben Carson in this made-for-TV biographical drama from TNT. Directed by Thomas Carter (Coach Carter), the movie reveals Carson's inspiring life story as a poor, inner-city youth who overcame great odds to become one of the world's best surgeons, thanks to the love of his determined single mother (played by Kimberly Elise) and an unswerving Christian faith. A touching and fabulous true story that leaves you amazed."
5,Wonderful!,"Great story, great acting, and great movie. Even better is that it is a true story about a real role model for all."
5,Marvelous!!!,"Is a great movie, to teach your children that anyone can be the best in life and specially if you beleive in God. The roll of the mother in this movie is very special, love it!!"
1,DEFECTIVE,"This DVD was defective. It froze, tiled, pixelated, and could not be skipped past any defective part. The seller Amazon.com LLC, had to know this because it froze very early at the beginning of the movie and could not be fast forwarded. I went to my account and tried to notify seller, but there was no ""contact seller"" like there was on all the other orders."
5,Gifted Hands,This is an excellent movie about an actual family and their struggles. Both boys become well known talented professionals. Cuba Gooding Jr. does a wonderful job.
5,Not the movie aired on TNT by the same title,"We had seen the movie that aired on TNT Febuary 7th, 2009 and really enjoyed it. Searching on Amazon, we found this same title in the ""Movie"" section on DVD. It is NOT the drama that was aired on TNT. Amazon does not present this product with enough detail to know that it is a documentary of Ben Carson. It is a great video but we still would like to get a copy of the TNT broadcast if they ever release one."
2,NOT PLEASED,"i ordered from this company at the beginning of March and till this day i have not recieved any kind of package from them and also they falso advertise, i didnt find out the movie i ordered was ONLY 30 minutes long until i emailed the company asking where my movie is, not a happy camper"
5,Gifted Hands,"This was a terrific movie. And, it was true. The acting was great! And, it taught a great lesson for young people. My husband and I really enjoyed watching this movie."
5,Very inspirational,"This movie shows that anyone could do anything in their life as long as they have a person that urges them to do better and make something out of themselves. Im glad this is a true story, amazing!"
5,Gifted Hands,Powerful story of an amazing life! Cuba Gooding does an excellent job protraying Ben Carson. Well worth buying and watching! :-)
1,Warning! This is not the movie!,The way Amazon presents this DVD is misleading. It was found under Movies. It is NOT the movie. It is a Companion to the book and all the reviews are for the book. I returned this unseen.
4,Nice product,"For an incandescent unit, these work great. I removed the 100 watt watt stock bulbs and installed 200 watt instead. The colors and brightness are wonderful, the units haven't shown any issues even when exceeding the duty cycle, and the crowd loves 'em."
2,"This is not ""Easy Listening"" it is ""Lounge""","This is not easy listening music, it doesn't even follow the basic Wikipedia definition. If you're looking for ""Vintage Lounge"", this is a great CD. There's a wide variety of kitsch. Wacky music. Wacky sounds. Wacky theme songs. But it is not easy to listen to. It is not pretty or lush or lite or beautiful. It's a great 50's collection. But don't be expecting any cool, elegant, over-processed radio hits from the 60's in the genre of Anita Kerr or Andy Williams. This three CD set is misnamed on the cover. In the record database it comes up as 'music to lounge by', which should have been the collection's name."
2,"I Prefer Soap & Water, Thank You Very Much","If I'm elbow-deep in an engine block, or just finished shoveling out the horse barn, I'm sorry: washing up with hand sanitizer just isn't going to cut it. Granted, GERM-X HAND SANITIZER is better than nothing when soap and water aren't available, but unless you live on Baffin Island or in a Third World country, soap and water are going to be at your disposal.My hands just don't feel clean once I've applied the GERM-X. They feel oily. . .filmy. . .sometimes sticky. Look, I know Vitamin E is good, which is in this sanitizer, and that this product is high-alcohol in content, which is a bacteria sterilizer, but come on: If I want a sticky sensation I'll wash my hands in maple syrup.When my appendages need a good scrubbing, give me a bar of soap and some H2O. Keep the GERM-X HAND SANITIZER for someone else who doesn't get as dirty as I get. Clean is good; water-and-soap-clean is even better.--D. Mikels, Esq."
1,A Guide for Using To Kill a Mockingbird in the classroom,"Over the years I have used teacher created resources for teaching different books. I have to admit this one is not one of the better ones on the market. What was this author thinking? I have taught `Mockingbird"" to numerous students over the last 20 years and even used it as one of the books for my masters in reading. In all the years I have never found the connection of ""Bloody Mary"" as well as other terms on pg. 26 in the book. Also pg.13 is still having me shake my head. There are much better books out there for teaching this WONDERFUL book."
1,Ironbound Vampire Sucks,"This low budget movie was exactly that. The actors were horrible and said their lines line they were reading them without expression. The plot was lame. I've seen other low budget films that were very good, but this one most certainly did not fall into that category. I'd advise others to steer clear of it and find something worth seeing."
2,Yes! You Too Can Be A Movie Director!...,"A true piece of rancid head-cheese, THE IRONBOUND VAMPIRE has the look and feel of the kind of movie I'd make, which is why I'm NOT a movie director! Scenes jump about, making little or no sense. I know it's about a hippie vampire guy and his harem of toothy ghoulfriends, but the rest of the characters were so bloodless, they all seemed undead! This one gets an extra star for the naughty gal-pal stuff near the end..."
4,"Eat Your Hear Out, Ed Wood!","If you are a fan of the films of Edward D. Wood, Jr. THEN BUY THIS DVD! Ultra B-Movie featuring Vampires, Psychics, Henchmen, Detectives & best of all...John Link!"
1,Lid stuck,"I bought this for my daughter's lunch box. The first two times we used it, I didn't put the lid on too tight and the food was lukewarm. The third try, we put soup in it and the lid locked on so hard that not only could she not open it, my husband couldn't get it open till 8 that night. This product is a waste of money."
1,didn't work!,"This thing is a little small but I was able to get a decent size portion in it. It didn't keep my lunch warm at all tho, but the time I had lunch it was almost cold! I heated it up by the instructions and even added an extra min or two in the microwave and it still didn't keep it warm!"
1,worst thermos,"By far the worst thermos I have ever bought. I am a teenager interested in keeping my food HOT, not cold. I put a simple meal like ravioli in it in the morning and by noon it was cold. That was very disappointing and I feel ripped off. It was a waste of money. I had high hopes because I actually thought it'd work. Wrong. Its best using a Thermos brand thermos because they know what they are doing. People on this review page may think ""OH you should put boiling water in the thermos for 15 mins."" Why, though? I should be able to put food in my thermos and eat it the way it went in the thermos-piping hot. My mom just ordered me a Thermos brand thermos and ive never had a better thermos. When it comes to stuff like this, use the brands that have been in the business for a long time and know what they are doing. Please save your money and don't buy this Aladdin thermos!"
1,"Great hidden spoon, but cheaply made","My son love this secret spoon compartment, but he dropped it the first day we had it (he's only four, it didn't fall that far) and it cracked. So the top leaks now and rather than buy another one, I think we'll use this for his at-home-secret-soup-spoon bowl and buy something else for school."
1,Is NOT leak proof,"I too bought one of these lunch bowls at Target and I can confirm that it indeed is not leak proof. My son started school and wanted soup. When I picked him up the teacher informed me that his soup leaked all over his lunch bag and book bag, making his folder and books all wet! There is a small hole in the slot where the take along spoon is (I assume for ventilation) and when I ran water on the underside of the lid I confirmed that it leaked through this hole. It also only does a marginal job of keeping food hot. When we sent spaghetti or pierogies they were only room temp come lunch time. Again I assume this is because of the small hole in the lid."
1,Don't bother,"I thought these would be great for giving my kids hot lunches at school. I wish I had never bought them. The lid is way too big for my kids' hands to be able to open (ages 5 & 6), but even if they get help from an adult to open it the thing doesn't keep the food warm. A waste of money. If I could give it no stars I would."
4,"Hard to open, but it works for my family","Like others have said, it can be hard to open. Once my daughter came home from school with it unopened and said that everyone from her teacher to the janitor had tried to open it, unsuccessfully. I put it into the microwave for 10 seconds and got it to open that day.We've continued to use it all school year, though, without another incident like that. I'm careful not to tighten it too tight and to wait a minute after heating it before closing it up. It's such a handy size. I just bought another one, so I guess you could say that I'm willing to take the risk--but I do send lunch money to school with my daughter, just in case."
1,"Gasket Popped out after One Use, Hard to Open","I bought this from Target thinking it would be a great idea for salads, soups and mac and cheese. It's shape makes it a nice eating dish instead of a narrower thermos type food container. However, after one use the rubber gasket popped out of one of the lids. It was impossible to put back as the rubber somehow stretched.Also as mentioned in other reviews, a five year old will not be able to open it without assistance."
5,Nice thermal bowl for lunch,"Ive had a pink one for a couple of years. I sent many things to daughter's daycare with success in keeping food warm without leaking. At the daycare an adult would open the bowl. It is wide, shallow and stable which makes it very suitable for kids to use. Being plastic, it is microwaveable. Now that she is in Kindergarten for only half day, she arrives home for lunch and thinks it is a total treat to get her lunch in this container with its own spoon. She loves to open it herself and get out the secret spoon and always eats her whole lunch this way. It holds a decent amount of food as well. For example, if I put in a half can of Spaghetti and meatballs, there is plenty of room left over for more. It washes well, and has not been stained despite frequent use with tomato based sauces. We have enjoyed this product and I forsee using it for quite awhile."
5,Keep buying these,"Not because there is a problem -- my kids keep loosing them. This is a huge time saver for school lunches, since it's microwaveable."
1,Leaks,"This is a waste of money I bought a pack of 2 and both leak--and yes the 1 star indicates ""I hate it!"". Opening and closing is easy if you open the spoon slot and use that for leverage to open and close for a nice tight fit but don't bother it still leaks when used for anything with liquid I tried filling them half full but still leaked poor seal the seal gasket actually popped off on one of them, I managed to get it back in. I was also careful to only hand wash but still very poor design especially when targeted towards kids who take these in their backpacks and the bowl ends up in any orientation. Very poorly designed I'm writing the company and asking for my money back."
3,This is a wonderful retro item,"I highly recommend this item. It is a cool retro gift. I bought it for a 9 year old girl for her room and she loves to stare at it. You have to be careful as the little mirrors fall off sometimes, but you can super glue them back on."
3,Mediocre mirror ball,"Eliminator Lighting is the budget arm of American DJ, but still a recognized name brand. That being said, I was expecting this mirror ball to be about the same quality as an unbranded ball I got on eBay a few years ago. I was very disappointed there is a large nut, washer, & bolt that comes out the bottom of it which is pretty unsightly. Also, the mirror tiles are not as uniform as I expected and are not fixed as closely together as the less expensive eBay one.Overall, it looks like a home-made ball my 14 year old son built and won't buy an Eliminator Mirror Ball again."
3,XAct XTR2CK Sirius Satellite Receiver with Vehicle Kit,"The way the radio seats into the speaker dock, it is not a snug fit, could loose power easily.There is no way to scroll channels, you have to keep pushing the up, down button to get to where you want."
4,For an older model it works great,Fast delivery and speedy replacement of defected unit. Would recommend for people moving from vehicle to vehicle. Eventhough it is an older unit the features are great.
3,No past perfect errors because there's no past perfect,"Interesting. A grammar book, pretending to present sentence essentials for writers, with nothing on the past perfect, one of six important verb tenses. Little wonder, I suppose, since there are numerous 'had' errors in the text; enough to indicate that the author doesn't know what it is or how to use it. And, importantly, when to NOT even try to use it by putting 'had' in front of a past tense verb. All those interested in English grammar should note that the schools of 'creative writing' actually teach that flashbacks should be signalled by putting 'had' in front of the first two, or three, or four, past tense verbs. And they defend it vigorously as the proper thing to do. Lots of Grammorons teach ""creative"" writing. Three stars: ""It's O.K."", but be careful."
4,Great gift for the Grandchild,"Our 4 year old grandchild jumped on this cycle right away and although he didn't immediately show interest in the educational aspect of the game, he loved it and was soon grabing letters and colors while getting some good exercise."
5,I remember this great game from years ago!,"MDK was one of the first computer games I ever played, and as such is one of the most fun I've played. The sniper mode is amazing! It's good to see that there are those that are still preserving this unique game."
5,Still great.,This is a great game and still one of the few FPS games I like. Oh and if you beat it on the PC you get a video by a french band. I spent months trying to find out who it was. In case you needed to know it is Billy Ze Kick (hence MDK BZK). Have Fun.
1,A Disappointment,"What a disappointment! Boosting Immunity is a collection of chapters by different authors that is poorly focused and lacks continuity. There is nothing new in this book. It is mostly a rehash of commonly available information and some of the chapters, like chapter two, read like they were copied out of an enclyclopedia. The most attractive thing about this book is the title. Save your money."
5,Thankgodness,"Wow, am I ever lucky I saw this book on someone's desk. Sandra Wilson has down to earth wit, psychological prowess, and a faith that believes God really can heal your hurts. If you start reading I hope you're ready to start changing. God might just do that using the words of this gifted and faithful counsellor and psychologist."
4,Not that hurt,The book was good but written for people who had suffered much more hurt than what I was looking for. Especially good if you were a victim of sexual abuse as a child. Written well and I did gain some great nuggets of insight. But the analogy I would use is the following: if my cut needed a band aid these cuts needed stitches.
4,"Historically brilliant, literarily flawed","R.U.R. is an immensely important book for its contributions to our language and our perception. Equally, it is excellent commentary on the mechanization of work, and the quest to turn people into simple, perfect machines.Nonetheless, this translation falls short as literature. Devoid of irony and wit, and possessing only a simple, transparent plot, R.U.R. does not equal the standard set by Capek himself with ""War with the Newts."""
4,Nice to have,"A very good accessory to be in the pocket of a photographer, at any type of shooting. Really smooth retractile brush. Once the cap is removed, the brush can be extracted with only one hand, just by twisting the base of it."
3,"Seems a bit coarse for slides, fair for lenses and optical pickups","The fibers of this brush are coated with (or are perhaps made from) a synthetic material that is somewhat blue in color, as in the image. The bristles are a bit coarser than I'd expected, I bought it to see if it might be suitable for dusting of photographic slides prior to scanning. I don't think I'll use it for that purpose, but I will likely use it for glass lenses. I didn't notice any particular dusting improvement over other soft brushes. The lipstick style is convenient for storage and protection of the bristles, I have another much older (and softer) lipstick photo brush that I also find convenient."
4,Great light for the price,"For the amount of light that it throws out, it's a fairly decent bargain. The only thing is that I may eventually have to replace the switch with another one since sometimes it takes some extra coaxing to turn on."
2,Bad switch,"Worked great until it started going off until I wiggled the switch. Usually stays on after the 2nd or 3rd try. Local Wal-Mart has this same item for $8, but if I'd gotten it with Prime, I could have saved standing in line 1/2 hr for a replacement. Noticed a different Wal-Mart has them with rocker switches (instead of slide, like this one).Lights of America 7020-6 24"" Under Cabinet Light, WhiteLights of America 7020-6 24"" Under Cabinet Light, White"
2,Bait and switch,"Consumers BEWARE as this product model#7020, 24"" light is NOT the same as the older models. The older models which you cannot find the the local stores anylonger use the T12 bulb (standard looking fat bulb). I assumed this being the same Model # would use the same bulb. It does Not. It uses a thin bulb T-8. It is Crappy. Thanks Lights Of America."
4,Corner Lighting.,"I am in a studio apartment. I have one of these (The black light version with a white bulb) under the kitchen[ette] cabinet. and when i was faced with a dark corner i decided to grab my final two blacklight stick fixtures from storage and add a white bulb, I mounted them one above the other in the corner and hung a temp. blindRedi Shade 1616204 Original Pleated White Paper Shade 36-by-72-Inch, 6-Pack(redi shade) cut to fit and bridge the corner in front of them. I am now going to purchase many more for the other corners and ceiling, i like a lot of light. These guys do a good job.Long life, durable and solid when mounted properly.I do wish they were linkable.However A great purchase for accent and supplemental lighting."
5,"Happy w/product, good company","The product is simply an undercabinet light, thus, not much to write about. When I recieved my item, the bulb was broken due to shipping, I called the company and without any hesitation they had a new to me in just a few day, I am very pleased with the way things were handled."
4,Light Box,"I was building a light box from Morton's, which recommended the Lights of America 24in under the counter unit as light in the box. I could not find one locally and ordered from ProMax Supply through Amazon. Everything in the box was built to accept this light, therefore no changes or adapatations were necessary. The only thing I would warn buyers about is that it takes forever and 3 days for the light to arrive by USPS from ME. And with no tracking informations, you sometimes wonder if you should be raising the questions about delivery as I was about to do when the package arrived in the hands of my letter carrier. If I hadn't been home, it would have been returned to the PO and then I would have needed to drive 10 or 12 miles to receive. I don't know about others, but I would just as soon pay FedEx or UPS freight, have tracking info and have it delivered to your door and left there. Thanks Chuck"
4,Doctor Who's Captain Jack Sings!,"John Barrowman isn't just another pretty face, and his credentials for entertaining go way beyond the new Doctor Who/Torchwood series, so why not buy this CD and listen to the Man sing his favorite Cole Porter classics?You won't regret it! Order SWINGS COLE PORTER, I did!"
5,Beautiful Voice,"What can I say...John Barrowmans' voice is every bit as beautiful as he is, such a rich and lush tone."
3,A Disappointment,"Coming after his last CD, which I loved, I had high hopes for this one, but found it somewhat of a disappointment. Nothing wrong with John's singing, which is stellar as always, but I found the arrangements uninspired and too middle of the road. Didnt really swing for me. If you're a Barrowman fan, you'll probably like it, but it should have been better."
3,"Okay, but not great.","John Barrowman, has a lot going for him ---- a pleasant voice, good looks, etc. I would have to classify this CD, however, as forgettable, rather than memorable. He seems to be going through the motions rather than delivering a memorable performance. The pantheon of male singers, from my perspective, are those such as Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Nat King Cole, etc. Mr. Barrowman, unfortunately, is just not in their league."
5,John Barrowman Swings Cole Porter,"John Barrowman has produced an excellent CD of the music of Cole Porter, containing many classic Cole Porter numbers mixed with a selection of the not so well known. Each of the selections is given a superb interpretation by the multitalented John Barrowman.I must confess that this CD has taken up residence in my car CD player since I purchased it. CD's like this performed expertly by the popular singer and actor John Barrowman will no doubt introduce many of today's youngsters to the music of one of the great song writers of the 20th century."
5,John Really Swings,"This is a great CD and it grows on you. After listening to the clips on line I purchased this. John Barrowman is more than just another singer, he has a grasp on the period this music comes from and actually sings the songs, as opposed to many who must ""re-imagine"" classic works. A bigger orchestra sound would have been lovely but that's just nit picking. To hear Barrowman with a full studio orchestra listen to him perform Night and Day on the ""De-Lovely"" Soundtrack.De-Lovely"
5,Very satisfied,"As advertised, no hassle.Suggest a spring to reduce impact on hardware.On time, in good shape.The whole family likes it.Very happy with purchase."
1,Inferior product,I don't know why they are still selling this product. I got the first bag replaced and found that the replacement had the same problem. The sand bags and fillings are not distributed evenly. You might injure your hand or feet/shin if you hit the hard part at full force. You have to pay the shipping cost if you choose to return it. I asked for replacement and the second bag is still not working. I gave up because there is too much trouble to bring the heavy bag back and forth.
4,Generic lens cleaning kit,its just a generic lens cleaning kit from china. you can probable find it cheaper elsewhere.
1,"All words, few pictures","This book is a big disappointment. Pages and pages and pages of text. Precious few photos or illustraions. No ""Step 1 illustration, Step 2 illustration, Step 3 illustration..."" I ordered three of this book for my sons-in-laws. I sent them all back and got the Reader's Digest ""Fix it Yourself"" instead. More expensive but A) updated recently, and b) profusly illustrated. Very simple to follow. Don't waste your time or money on this wordy loser."
1,Boo hoo,I had no idea how old this edition was or I would not have purchased it. I was disappointed with this.
3,C'mon now!,"This movie isn't THAT bad. I'm fully aware it's hip to constantlybash the 80's (afterall, that's what the great MTV does) but thismovie isn't the bad.Is there some cheese?? Of course... Most B movies have alot cheese just like most movies nowdays are cheesy all together. While it's not really believeable that a trucker is a professional arm wrestler, it is a good positive feel good movie that displays the best acting of Sly's career..Good movie.. But if you are the average american you might notlike this movie since it's feel good... Afterall, we can'thave that nowdays can we?"
2,SATIN'S ROADMAP,"A study in manipulation and evil.Karl Marx was such a squanderer he could not balance a simple check book.His main intent........make people believe that they are owed a living(re-distribution of wealth) and are supporting a just cause by demonizing others that have become successful through their own labors.(kinda like what's going on today) HUH???????????History's most important document? It Is;if you want to know what the Communists have in store for you and your families.I hope that everyone reads this book, so they may be aware of the danger that Communisim poses to the entire world."
4,"great all-stars album, no booklet, the sound lacks something","I already have the LP, and was waiting for the cd reissue..It's quite disappointing there's no booklet inside, specially for those who don't have the LP.Musically speaking it's a great all-stars album, with Gerry Mulligan, Jon Faddis, Phil Woods, Ron Carter. Arrangements are very good, this is a good job of LeGrand's, who clearly cut the parts on the soloists' abilities. Those who like Jon Faddis playing (like me) may appreciate his playing here, relaxed and not so extreme, if you know Faddis you know what I mean.On the technical side, the recording unfortunately can't claim a full range sound spectrum, sounds lack of mid-bass for example. Otherwise the sounds are technically well mixed."
4,finally,"I have been looking for thread earrings without charms for a long time. Finally, Just what I was looking for. I got a pair for my daughter as well. THANK YOU"
3,well. its beautiful.. but not worth price,This is pretty beautiful earring.. Everyone loved it when I wore.. but it is not as thick as you feel in the picture and very delicate.. It can easily slide out of the hole.. So wear your hear up when you put this on.. I nearly lost it...
5,AWESOME BIG SCREEN,I bought my TV this weekend and the first movie I put in was Black Hawk Down the helocopters were like they were right thier I hooked a souround sound system with dvd and with the cristal clear Big Screen and my system it was I was in a digital theater.The extras like auto convergance is a plus and the digital filtering and auto format of the picture this is a high end TV without speending the $...I work on simulators and deal with barco projectors for a living the picture I get from this TV has me realy impreased at what technoligy has put out for the consumer.Lets see great picture great sound pluse great price what a deal.
1,Go with Windows 98SE or XP instead,I don't see any reason to go with Windows ME. A lot of games that run fine with Windows 98SE don't run in Windows ME.Windows ME no longer has security updates. You can't get an updated firewall with ME. I wouldn't go on the internet with a computer running ME.Windows XP is the best choice for installation on older machines that didn't come with it.
5,From Autumn To Ashes never disappointed me.,"I have all their albums. All of them are GREAT. Some of the songs on Too Bad Youre Beautiful come off a little softer than say songs from Holding a Wolf By The Ears, but still totally hardcore. If you like From Autumn to Ashes, or are just getting into them, this is one of their staple albums. SO BUY IT, AND LOVE IT."
3,Starts off good but then it gets emo and stupid,The first 5 songs are good but then on the 6th song they begin the song by haveing a girl talk to a guy like she's heartbroken and sad about breaking up and in the middle of the eighth song they have a sad guy replying to her and HE'S CRYING. it has other good songs besides the first 5 but the sad breakup talk in songs 6 and 8 killed the album alittle
1,Did not work,"Cable did not work after testing with several tv/computer combinations. The price was too low for me to go through the issue of returning, but obviously will not buy again. Also, my cables did not come in the belkin packaging in the pictures. The cable came in a cheap plastic bag with no brand labels."
3,Ok does what it says it does,This is a good product I use to hook up my Xbox s to a dell monitor. When I got I found outbit didn't support sound and it did not work with my Toshiba thrive.
2,Didnt work for me,I probably didnt do something right but i got these along with a VGA cable to hook my laptop up to a tv.. couldnt get sound out of the tv with this cord. I just bought a hdmi cable instead of using this and the vga
2,Defective Cable,"The cable I received was defective in the way it looked. There were bumps and unevenness on one side of the cable (one of the wires), while the other side was smooth the way cables normally are. It seems that there are seconds or irregulars in this cable being sold. Oh, another thing - the cable is very, very thin.I realize some people may not care about the way the cable looks as long as it works. But for people that would like a cable whose quality looks good, you may appreciate this information.I wasn't able to find any other brand of this type of cable in a 12 foot length online..."
4,Y? Because,"So I have a cheap amplifier without any of those fancy optical interconnects, and it's way over on the other side of the room from my TV, so I need a long cable and this is a long cable so it's what I got."
2,Belkin Audio Cable,"To be honest you get what you pay for. It's great to have a cable that allows me to play my Ipod or computer on my speakers, but the quality is poor. If you are looking for something that does just that than this product does the job. If you are looking for something of better quality then spend a few extra bucks and invest in a cable that is 10-15$. It will be well worth it and evident in the sound quality."
5,Good quality.,Really good quality cable. I bought this to hook up my computer to my home stereo. It's always good to keep a cable like this around.
4,Good price for a good product,I have been using this product for a week now and i would say it has been great. The shielded plates provides Superior sound quality. Good rubber quality. I would recommend this item for everybody.
1,Junk,I bought two of these cables to hook up pc's to TV's. One never worked at all and the other worked once. Junk.
4,Good deal,Nicely made cable. Works as expected. reasonable price. I recommend this product. Do like I did and get several while they're cheep!!
4,"perfect way to connect Home Theater's audio, home stereo's audio, an amplifier (pro-audio that is), a mixer, PA, or ANYTHING wit","The perfect way to connect true stereo audio signal from your home theater's audio, home stereo's audio, an amplifier (pro-audio power amp that is), a mixer, PA, or ANYTHING with RCA stereo inputs! ...to your mp3, smartphone, iPod-Phone, or ANY DEVICE utilizing a 3.5mm(1/8"") jack."
4,so far so good,"This is a pretty basic bit of equipment that you can get at your local Target or Walmart or what-have-you. I picked it up via amazon because it was a couple dollars cheaper, and Belkin is a good brand name."
4,a cheap fix to a big problem,"The sound on my computer monitor speakers is terrible (and no help from the manufacturer despite several calls), so I have been trying to replace them with others I have. No luck, since unlike older computers whose speakers did not require an amplifier, the more recent ones do. So with this product I ran the computer's sound outlet to an old boom box. The sound is vastly improved for a very minimal cost. After some drilling, I will be able to hook it up to the stereo amplifier for even better sound."
5,Does the Job!,This cable is a very good product. It does what its supposed to do without any problems. The length is very nice to have to reach devices farther away. A good buy.
2,Engineer,"I was anxious to use this to connect from laptop to TV-S-video. However I could not connect the adopter to the TV.I think the connecting end is either damaged or not properly made for an easy connection. I am very much disappointed.Also, the cost and time/effort associated with returning the cable is expensive, and we run the risk of not getting the proper cable. Therefore, I feel it would have been better if I had bought it in a store."
1,Still haven't gotten the product,"After not receiving this product way past when it should have been delivered, I finally received a box only to have gotten a CAT6 cable instead. The invoice was correct, the product in the box was wrong. Grrrrr. I could have just gone to the store and gotten it but thought since I was purchasing another product, I would get this too and save me a trip! I will make a wiser choice next time and not use this company. As of today I am waiting on the RMA number to return the wrongly shipped product."
4,Needed better sound from TV,"TV has a good sound system but lacks something in depth. I used this to connect from the TV audio out mini-jack to the home theater system AUX RCA jack input. Work's great and now I can rattle the dishes and frighten the dog (just kidding). Hey, this item is simple and cheap. It's a good buy. What more to say."
4,connect your pc to your home theatre system in no time,"i bought this cable to connect my laptop to my home theatre receiver, eliminating the need for computer speakers whcich could never match up to the sound of my home theatre system. the 12 ft cable is plenty long enough and it is surprisingly high quaality for the price. i don't give the cable 5 stars because i know there are higher quality cables out there with 24 karat gold connectors which will give you a cleaner sound. don't buy the 12ft version unless you need the length because the longer the cable, the more signal loss there is. this is perfect for the average guy who just wants to listen to his mp3's or play PC game audio through home theatre system."
3,"Cable not well sheilded, so it is noisy","You can't beat the price, but if you are plugging your computer into your home theater sound system, you will hear a noise that is a hum, at a lower volume than what I found after buying a better cable that is sheilded, for just a little more money.Pro-Techgroup Professional Grade 15 FT 3.5mm Stereo Male to 2RCA Male 22AWG Cable - Gold Plated Connectors"
1,Terrible audio feedback,"Used this cable to plug my laptop into my stereo system. Got horrible static and hum along with the audio. Not usable at all. As I rotated and messed with the connector, the feedback got better and worse. I suspect it's poor workmanship. I have a shorter version of this same cable that worked fine. Spend a couple dollars and buy a better quality cable."
4,It works,"It's long. It's cheap. And it does what it's supposed to. My sound system isn't top notch so I can't tell if the cable has any negative effect on quality. Some reviewers criticize the longevity of the cable but I have yet to have an issue over several months of use. No complaints, but it's probably not the most high quality cable out there so maybe you should pay more for a cable for your best of the best audio system, but for the rest of us this should do well."
5,Long enough for my needs,This cord works great. It was the only one I could find over 5 feet. I use it to connect my laptop to my audio receiver to listen to music or movies.
4,Belkin Y audio cable,The cable is good but our speaker system is antiquated and has a noise that we don't like.We think we need an updated soundbar or similar.
5,Awesome,The cable works like a dream. I've had no problems what so ever. The sound quality is great and the cable is thick so it's very durable. Highly recommend.
3,Considerable amount of humming at high levels of volume,I connected this cable between a mini hi fi and a TV. I got some sound alright but there was a considerable amount of humming which again is ok at lower volumes but the humming gets amplified greatly when the volume gets turned up to loud levels. This might probably due to the cable not being shielded properly which in turn would definetly result in a deterioration of the sound quality and furthermore would never reproduce sound accurately if either end of the cable is connected to a device with amplification.
5,Just What I Needed!,"Had to replace my last cable beaus we lost it, but this does a really good job! It's also just long enough to reach about anywhere."
2,decent quality but tools look used,There are scratches on the handle and fingerprints all over the blade.
3,"Decent quality, but definitely not new condition","I received both the 3 Piece and 2 Piece tool sets today. The quality seems to be decent, definitely better than I would have expected for the money. I must warn you, however, that these tools have been used previously. There were small scratches on the metal trim, wear marks on the wood grain, and even full fingerprints on the metal! I purchased these tools for myself and will use them happily, but they are not ""new"" enough to give as a gift. The person who receives them will definitely think you gave them your old tools."
1,This is some crappy stuff!,"Eveyone jumped on these because we could not believe they were ""free"" or so, as they were combined with our deal. If they were free I paid too much. Mine are going back. There are sharp edges all over the closed knife to snag and or cut on. Scratches all over too. I would be afraid to use the pliers. As one reviewer stated ""junk"". Nice sheaths, that's about it."
4,Decent for the price (and not used),"Unlike the sets purchased by some other reviewers, mine show no signs of use or wear. They're not Gerber quality, but what do you expect for the price? All the tools seem usable, and they look good. Handy to have in the toolbox or glove compartment.I have to agree with one reviewer that the placement of the smaller tools in the multi-tool handle makes it hard to open them up. Also, the brass inset on the screwdriver handle isn't quite flush, making a slight edge that could be uncomfortable under hard use.Considering I got this set along with the screwdriver/utility knife set for $15, it's a pretty good deal."
2,I think I just had a bum experience,"My set just arrived today and I was surprised to find it scratched, dirty, and slightly bent with fingerprints all over it. It also has either blood or oil in one crevice! It came in a box. vs. the plastic blister pack shown on the manufacturers web site so I suspect this is a returned item that was represented as new to both me and Amazon. Also, there were NO instructions at all on how to use the tools. Although I know most of the functions having owned Swiss Army Knives, there are some tools in this that stump me. Additionally, the tools themselves are either dull or sharp, I find both contained within this set. The lockback knife looks like it's been run over. If you are planning on purchasing this as a gift set for someone, (as I did for my husband) be careful and remember, Amazon.com will take back returns. I will wait to see if he wants to return it before I make a decision."
2,Unlucky - got the used ones,"I ordered these tools a few weeks ago without reading the reviews very carefully. I intended to give them as a gift. Bad idea. As others have described, each of the tools in the set is either scratched, greasy or just worn down. Quality seems decent, not great - about what i expected for the low price. (The unlocking mechanism of the knife is rather clumsy.)I am disappointed enough that i will return these - tool that look secondhand are not a good gift."
2,Disappointed,"The set I received had very noticeable scratches on the brass and the wood finish was dull in several places. The pivoting mechanisms are definitely lubricated with grease (it is black and does stain your fingers.) Overall not very satisfied with the product, although I would not mind paying a few dollars more if the quality was assured."
4,Good stuff for 12 bucks but too big sizes to fit in a pocket,Good stuff for 12 bucks but sizes too big to fit in a pocket!
2,Mine are only a little used,"I'm thinking the vast majority of these sets were stored loose somewhere, and hauled out, oiled/greased, and roughly boxed. The set I got are pretty scuffed, and the crevices are gummed with what I expect is oil applied to dusty/dirty surfaces. My multi-tool had some fingerprints, as well. However, the blades are in decent shape, and it doesn't look like the tools were actually USED, just kind of scruffy.Like everyone else, I got them in a package deal, and together it's a bargain. However, if I'd bought them at full price and/or intended them as a gift, I would be pretty upset.The tools themselves are decent, and have good heft from the wood. They're not top of the line, but they're better than ""Winchester"" or other low-end brands.A screaming deal for the above-minimum quality, in the package deal anyway.However I have to give two stars for the sheer fact of selling used or semi-damaged items as new, ESPECIALLY items that are really intended as gifts much of the time."
4,Wow,"Much better than what I was expecting for the price. The folding pocket knife is very nice and sharp. It is sturdy and since it is so cheap you don't worry about ruining it as much. The multi tool is very nice as well and the multi tool with the pliers is decent, but for the price it is hard to complain. I recommend this to anyone that is looking for some cheap working tools."
2,bulky pieces of tools,"I don't like it because the tools are hard to pull out and the whole thing is heavy and bulky. But hey, it's a cheap piece of gift that you can send off to people who may need it...so, no complain there."
2,Nice Overall But Buy Beware!,"I like many other have recieved pieces that look like they were used. My knife came with very obvious ugly scratches all over the brass. Not really pleased about this, since I was planning on giving the set as a gift. Don't really want to return such an inexpensive product. Too much hassle for how little I paid. Still, sending customers scratched and dinged merchendise isn't acceptable, even at a low price. Buyer BEWARE."
3,Not a BAD deal...,"This set is a PRETTY good set of tools. They're not as well made as a few others I own from Leatherman or Craftsman. Still, not bad for the money. They ARE nice to look at, if that's what you want them for."
1,Just not what I expected,I was expecting more authentic Wizard of Oz style. I guess maybe I didn't look closely enough.
1,This product broke the third time I used it!!!,I purchased this toaster a number of months ago. It broke about a month ago after I had used it three times.-Alfredo
2,Not a great keyboard,"I bought this keyboard to use with a handheld Sony Vaio. It is very difficult to use. If you do not hit the key directly vertically, it does not work. Typing speed is very slow. I think that it is a OK product for the price, but do not expect it to function equivalently to a regular keyboard."
2,not what you see,"This carrier is NOT the one in the picture. It is a solid top do it does not have the top wire opening. No side door either. It opens like a suitcase.I have not used product yet, but appears awkward, and unsure of how sturdy it is.I will not return it because I would have to pay shipping and 15% of the cost of the product. If I can not use it as a cat carrier I will use it for something else. I believe it will work for my kitten, but it seems like he will out grow it soon."
5,FABULOUS,"I loved the kennel. My cat is pretty large for a 1 year old. He's not fat, but he is VERY muscular. He didn't have a problem with this kennel at all. I was even delayed by 6 hours, and I let him out in the pet area, but he didn't seem to mind being in it either.It's not real large, but it fits PURRFECTLY under the seats of the plane. He flew in cabin with me, and slept.The product was sturdy and a great buy. My best friend after seeing it now wants one. If I had to purchase another before flying I would definitely go back to this."
4,Handy Little Cat Carrier,"I recently purchased 3 cabin top type animal carriers from Amazon. This type of carrier has a hinged top that makes animal transfers really easy. The heavy plastic is also easy to clean and holds up well to the constant cleaning/disinfecting schedule required in shelter sanitation procedures. The sliding door lock tends to stick after frequent use, but I will probably purchase more of these in the future."
3,Perfect size but.......,"The size is exactly what I needed. The kennel is made fairly cheap but the biggest problem is the 2 sliding pieces used to lock the top down. It is very hard to open and close the kennel.I was going to get the one with the wire on top but read the reviews and decided against it (again, cheaply made) and went with this one. I should have went to a pet store so I could actually see it since returning items bought on-line is such a hassle. By the way, my dog is crate trained but hates this kennel. It scares her when I try to secure the lid. The price is right but I still regret buying it."
5,Great knife!,Gerber makes excellent knives! Thanks to the clip this knife sits comfortably at the edge of my pocket for east access. The E-Z out description is very accurate since I can open the blade with one hand. The blade is very sharp and the serrations make cutting rope a ton easier! Excellent knife!
5,Great Universal Knife!,"Very solid knife. I use mine everyday for work. Rubber finger grips keep knife in hand wet or dry. Lock release is in a great position...hard to accidently press under use. Strong blade. Stays sharp for a long time ""excluding concrete and metal""This knife won't let you down. Good job Gerber Knives!"
3,Real EZ and stylish,"The blade is sharp out of the box. For what i paid for it, its worth it.I like the design on the blade and the feel of the whole thing on my hand."
5,Great,Good product. Exactly what I ordered. Going to be using this primarily for fishing.Light weight and very sharp. Happy with purchase
5,I gave this knife to myself for my birthday.,I gave this knife to myself for my birthday and it is great for cutting up chitlins as we slaughter hogs in the wintertime at my pig farm in Vietnam.
5,Great knife,"This is my fourth E-Z Out. So far I love it as much as my previous Gerbers. I have carried an E-Z Out in one form or the other since 1996. The only reason I have had to replace them is due to loss or loaning them out, never to be seen again. The price is great and the quality compares to knives costing twice as much."
4,As described,I have started sprouting in quart Mason jars. This rack is good for draining my sprouts but it is too big. I could not find one smaller so it works..it doubles as a cup dish drainer as well. This would be a good size for someone who sprouts multiple jars at a time. I only have two batches going at a time.
1,hate it,"OK I officially hate this item. I was across the room and it just fell for no reason breaking a number of loved dishes. the little notches were in place and everything....previous review (3 stars)get a larger bottom tray than amazon recommends -- otherwise it is fine. does slip occasionally like the other reviewed said, but not so much as to bother me. i just don't like that i end up with water all over the counter bc the tray is too small."
2,Disappointed - Terrible Compared to Prevoius Version,"I had one of these dish racks for 10 years, and loved it. But it was getting rusty so I opted for a replacement. The problem is that the dimensions on the replacement are slightly different (the main slots on the side that has the cup holders is about 1/2"" shorter than the older version) which means that it no longer holds standard dinner plates securely. It is baffling why a perfectly functional design would have been changed in this way. I did figure out that the rack can hold dinner plates satisfactorily (but not still not as securely as before) if they are put in at a slight angle so that one side is in a slot and the other side is an adjacent slot - not an ideal solution but it enables me to use what would otherwise be a pretty useless rack, since like most people I eat off of a standard dinner plate frequently."
1,Won't stand up,"I loved the aspect of being able to fold it up and put it away. Well, all it does is fold up... my housekeeper won't even try it, she's afraid she'll break my dishes if it folds up unexpectedly."
2,doesn't hold dinner plates well,"I really like this dish rack for its attractiveness, and I like the way it is set up to hold cups all down the long side. The only problem with that is that the placement of the crossbar under the cup holders doesn't leave quite enough room for a large dinner plate. It's doable, but a bit precarious. Unfortunately, that makes it not very useable."
3,Not as advertised.,"The ""double cup"" actually arrived as a ""single cup"" dish rack. Even though the item description and photo clearly shows cups on both sides of the rack, the item only has capacity for cups on one side and we were told that was the only rack the vendor had."
5,great drainer,fits eggsactly. maximizes space. strong.we've used it for everything for 3 years now. has never collapsed. haven't used it for a 2 ft high pile of cast iron yet...
3,From the Back Cover.,"Is baptism a man-centered ordinance, or is it a God-centered sacrament? Is it a demonstration of man's faith, or is it a sign and seal of God's promises? Should professing believers only be baptized, or is baptism to be administered to the children of believers as well? What scriptural grounds exist for acceptance of either position? These and other important questions are dealt with in this extensive examination of the controversial subject of paedobaptism."
4,A Good Guide for Rehabilitators,"Concise, useful advice on rehabilitating bobcats. I have been rehabilitating bobcats for over 20 years and didn't find any significant areas where I disagreed with the author.What this author, or any bobcat rehabilitation author, has yet to mention is that a cat is a cat. With the exception of cheetahs, which are dog-like in their ability to be domesticated, cat behavior and body language is the same between domestic cats, bobcats and large cats (I worked with a juvenile jaguar at one point.) The lack of a longer tail can make bobcats a little harder to read, as every cat owner knows that a rapidly thrashing tail generally means a cat contemplating unpleasant activities, but ear position, whisker position, hair being raised, muscle tensing, etc. are the same in all of the cats. Just remember that you can read a cat correctly 95% of the time. The other 5% can kill or main you.Overall, though, a good book for beginners."
1,Horrible!,"This is the most HORRIBLE children's book I have ever encountered. I gave it one star because I had to. I think this quote from the book pretty much sums up the whole book. ""And then it wraps you up within its coils,You feel a faint restriction of serpentine constriction, In moments you can barely breathe or cough, You face a scary issue, Is the boa going to squish you? It's impossible to yank the serpent off, even though you're bony, He clings like macaroni, It feels like you're about to be DECEASED."" Now does that sound like a children's book to you?"
5,One of my favorite American Diaries!,"Thirteen-year-old Summer MacCleary is an indentured servant. Although she misses her parents that died and the aunt and sisters she left behind in London, she works hard for the day seven years into the future when she will have at last earned her freedom. But strange events start to threaten Summer's future. Why did her master's daughter, Letty, appear one night, distraught and weeping? Why is Letty accusing Summer of stealing a valuable ring that has dissapeared? Summer doesn't know why, but she does know that she must find the thief and expose him or her before her master gets angry enough to sell her to a master that could be truly awful. But can Summer find the courage to do this?"
5,I cried so hard,"I cried so hard. This book is the only book i have ever known to make me cry. I could not stop crying. I love this book and it touched me in a way no other book has. This book is worth your money and worth your time. Its a very quick read but a very moving one at that. I thought it would be a really bad novel, but once i got into it it was okay. Eric has AIDS i couldn't believe it. I wont give away any part of the story. You wouldnt understand it anyways. Read the book. Think about it."
5,Really good story,Got that book from one of my students and at first I was not really keen to read it. But I think I would have missed much if i did not do so. Its the only book which made me cry till now and the best one I read so far.Good work Jeannie!!
2,Disappointed from England,"I thought this book was going to be good judging from the blurb on the cover. Suppose it was fairly well written, if very formulaic. Oh boy, those characters, how unreal can you get, as a former art student and incidentally a motorcycle pillion rider myself (sorry I havnt yet lived long enough to pop out and do a spot of plane sky writing in my spare time)I mean there is fantasy and fantasy, and this made mockery of a serious subject, it didnt start too badly then became worse and worse,from a most unbelievable lawyer, ever dealt with real ones? A Dad who would surely have been decked by someone much sooner along the line, a priest that should have been reported, to various other air heads, nevertheless, I see lots of other people enjoyed this, so horses for courses."
3,A Crack in Forever,"i found the writing in this story to be so matter of fact that i couldn't get close to the characters. because i couldn't get close, i didn't really feel for what they were going through. i thought it was a good quick summer read, but definitely not a tear jerker."
2,It wasnt what I expected,"I bought this item two weeks ago, and it was not what I expected from it. I spent couple nights in a camp where the temperature was about 29 - 30 F during the nights. I was extremely cold inside even though the item says zero degrees. I would not recommend it to anybody. I am paying the price for buying cheap. Nice colors, nice material but not enough to be rated upto even three stars."
3,Ok but not fantastic,"I used this sleeping bag on a few occasions and I never felt completely warm, even when temperatures went around 30-40 degrees F.On top of it, the weight is not that light, neither the bulk.I ended up paying up to 180$ to get a real down sleeping bag which weights less than 1/2 of the weight of this one... On serious hikes, this makes a difference!"
2,no way a zero degree bag!,"I've owned this bag for a few years now and although i'm happy with it in the spring and summer, this is by no means a fall/winter bag. I've been stuck very cold in 30 degree temps and was not a happy camper. I even bought a liner for it and gave it another try and in 24 degree temps, froze my you know what off. Don't even think about this bag for cold weather use!"
2,I don't like it.,"I will not be considering the price of this bag in this review just making a few points. The rating on these is strange since I sleep in this bag in house at 60+ temp and it barely keeps me warm without anything. 0 degrees? I wouldn't want to be in this bag at less than 50, outside, but maybe its just me. You'de think by 2008 they would put large zippers on these to make them easier to manage but the zipper is small, and is a constant problem. I guess one has to comment on the price which is cheap, but I would have and undoubtably will have to spend at least double or triple to get the warmth advertised and hopefully a bigger zipper."
4,great for the price,"very warm- was summer camping and used it more as a quilt- just closed it up on the coldest night (maybe around 30) and it was fine (not sure I'd be too happy in it in zero degrees, but I am always cold)- I was used to a down bag so I wasn't expecting it to be so big, but all in all it is great"
3,"Nice try, but...","""Tubular Bells"" achieved its fame when the opening was used as the theme for ""The Exorcist"". The haunting notes of the beginning imparted the feel of what this movie was all about, and, for good or bad, is associated with that movie. This album, which I have on both vinyl and CD, is an attempt to translate Mike's intricate rock-pop composition to a full orchestra. And while it isn't bad, it doesn't impart the same energy and feeling that the original does. I give them credit for trying, but only the truest of fans might want to listen to this one."
4,Soul Jazz At It's Best...Blue Note Style!,"This ""Heroes of The Hammond"" album is part of a well packaged and economical series simply titled ""the blue series"". What you get here is 11 songs that show off the wonderful sounds of the jazzy hammond b-3. I hadn't heard that much soul jazz before this purchase, and it served as an excellent starting point for me. I would recomend it to anyone looking for a good place to start if they are at all interested in soul jazz, or even fans of the hammond sound."
4,It's Balki Claus!,"Perfect Strangers was one of the best sitcoms ever. In this season 4 Christmas episode, Balki feels badly for Mr. Gorpley not having anyplace to spend Christmas, so he invites him to the cousins' party, in spite of the fact Larry had already said he was not welcome. Balki shows the true meaning of Christmas spirit.Normally, I would have given this 5 stars. It's a great episode of one of my favorite shows. However, I was extremely disappointed that this episode was edited (which I should have realized by the 22 minute runtime). Some of that probably came by showing the very short version of the credits, but I noticed three scenes that had lines cut, including the end. I understand (though I do not like) that shows were edited when they ran in syndication, due to the time constraints as more and more commercials were added in, but there is no reason they cannot offer the original uncut episodes for sale."
1,Very bad filter,"I have to replace this FX12P filter only after 4 months of use (I bought a new GXRM10G filter set from Home Depot). Suddenly one day the GXRM10G stopped working - no water out of the faucet.I disassembled it. The post-filter looked OK (still white), but the pre-filter one became black. Worse, the pre-filter then stopped to filter the water well, so as result it damaged the RO membrane, making me to replace all of them.My water quality is fine - for years we have drunk from the faucet. We use the filter just after having childrenThat contradicts to what they claim that the pre-filter can last 6 months and the RO membrance can last 3 years.After relacing first time, 2 days ago, after a month, the filter stopped giving water again. I opened the pre-filter and see that it became black again. I had to buy to replace it again.Don't buy this. If this hapens again next month, I will trash the whole GXRM10G."
1,Junk,"Don't buy this thing..it's trash. I just got it to try it out and it doesn't work at all. It works fine with one ethernet wire in, but once i plug in a second, I get no connectivity from either computer. Save your 8 bucks for a router."
2,misleading advertising,"When ordering this product I was led to believe it shipped free. I was billedalmost $ 5 .! 2ndly, 2 items are pictured whereas I received only one. Notwithstanding the health properties of this oil, I believe it is much overpriced.I suggest buying somewhere else."
4,"Love this corer, but needed to purchase another one","This apple corer is the best, easy to use and the end is sharp enough to cut through large apples. I use mine a great deal as I love baked apples and use the hollowed out inside for raisins, vanilla, cinnamon and lemon juice (yum!). I need to buy a second one though, because the washer/olunger top at the end keeps coming unscrewed and falling off. I was fortunate that the little washer hasn't gone down the garbage disposal yet, as the plunger did. I was able to retrieve the plunger as it's larger, but it would have been a real challenge to find the washer if it had gone. These corers are not expensive and better than the other corers I have seen, so I'm going to buy another one and hope it stays together a bit longer. That will give me time to ask friends for ways to keep the washer on top attached to the plunger (maybe even glue?) I want a corer on hand in case I lose a part and can't keep putting the one I have back together."
4,Apple corer,"Used this tool for the first time yesterday, it does a good job of removing the core from the fruit and the plunger is a good feature, saves your fingers from the very sharp blade. The only drawback I found is cleaning it, there is no easy way to get the inside of the tube clean and it can't be disassembled. It's stainless steel so rust isn't a problem but I'm concerned about having leftover apple spoiling inside the tool, especially on the top of the plunger. It's not a deal breaker but it would be better if the tube was removable for cleaning, if they threaded the rod and and the top disc I think that would solve the problem."
5,Love it,Works perfectly and is very easy to use. Saved me lots of time. Doesn't take up much space in my cabinet.
3,"All right, nothing spectacular","Having trouble keeping the corer straight through the apple so some seeds are left. You have to be aware of your hand placement when using this item to keep from injuring yourself. Works, but will look for something different."
4,Norpro Stainless Apple Corer with Plunger,I use it to core baking apples. Easy to work with as long as the apple are fresh; otherwise the core breaks off in the plunger
2,"Title for listing is very misleading. You only get 250 packets - NOT 500, which means it is twice as expensive as it seams",Product is good - no dyes works as good if not better than major brands. HOWEVER it is not a good value as it appears since you only get half the number of packet the title indicates. It is NOT 500 packets - it is only 250 packets.
2,Another book on the Man.,"This coffee table book covers the once again subject of the great boxing legend, Muhammad Ali.From the 1960s through to the present day is coved with some quite good pictures. However when a great person's life is covered over and over again it becomes quite boring, although no disrespect to the great man himself."
3,Not the Greatest but..........,"Here is a book that adequately covers what it sets out to do. The authors intent was to provide an overview of Ali's career without delving too deeply into any one part, or any one fight. With some terrific photos, Ali's life and career from his start in boxing, the 1960's Olympics, the fights with Liston, Frazier and Foreman etc., right through to the 1996 Olympics are covered in brief details. If you have a growing interest in the Greatest Boxer of all time, this book will give you a good base."
3,"This is not ""The Taliesin Orchestra""","To Begin with, this is a a five piece band with a name of Talisyn. This is not The Taliesin Orchestra that this is listed under. The Group members are Jennifer Holzschneider: Vocals, Matthias Hellmold: Guitars, Michael Haarhaus: Bass, Rudiger Blank: Keyboards and Markus Hinzmann: Drums. The album consist of 8 tracks 1 Sad Reality, 2 Silence Burns Under Skin, 3 What The Moon Brings, 4 Rush Hour (Instrumental), 5 Moving Mania, 6 Way Of Insight, 7 Irresistible Recurrence, 8 King Of Dreamlands. I believe this is classified as Alternative music, I am not a qualified critic, so I found it to be listenable to with the vocals mostly louder than was necessary, and most of the tracks had long instrumentals segments included in them."
5,excellent book with a variety of crafts...,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is one of the better ones in this series. Some of the projects take longer than an hour but they are worth it. Lots of unique ideas.
3,"A good debut, sign of things to come","Hometown Girl, haunting and evocative, is an excellent debut album. While not her strongest work, still it has a lot to offer. Especially evocative are Other Streets And Other Towns and Family Hands, my favorite off the album. ""Raised by the women who are stronger than you know/A patchwork quilt of memory only women could have sewn/The threads were stitched by family hands, protected from the moth/By your mother and her mother, the weavers of your cloth."" Does it get more powerful than this?"
3,"Mary, where are you?","I hear a beautiful song by a polished performer (Maura O'Connell?), my mind says ""Wow"", and I just have to find out who the composer is and, many times, the composer is Mary Chapin Carpenter. So I find myself purchasing her CD's and, while very nice, there's no ""Wow"" in them for the most part--""Hometown Girl"" is an example. I listen to it once and it goes on the shelf, and I wonder why she gives her best away."
4,Good dvd,"Older son loved Miffy, wanted younger one to be able to enjoy it too. Language is clear and simple storylines. Dvd is easy play with good episodes. Only disadvantage is that theme song does not play at start of each episode, and we loved the song."
1,Heavy weight,"I have bought these for my grandfather who had itchy and swollen feet. I was looking for light shoes with smooth fabric that would help him walk easily and not make his skin more irritated. what I liked about these shoes was the fact that they were easy to slip on.unfortunately, when these shoes arrived, they were heavy in weight and the fabric was some sort of wool which would not help at all in reducing the irritation he had.If you are planning to buy it for an elderly to walk with it, I would recommend that you find a lighter shoe and let me know where you bought it from :)"
1,Wast of Money! Does Not Work,"I bought this from the infomercial. It never cooked pasta for me, or for anyone else I would loan it to after I heard them talking about it. So my purchase was good for something! I loaned it out to about 6 people, each after talking about it and wondering if it worked. I told them not to bother. That I'd give them mine if they tried and liked it. They all gave it back and thanked me for letting them try before they bought and wasted their money."
5,"A simple, easy to use tool","I bought this tool, and within 1 hour of opening it, i had made the template holder and was cutting dovetails in an oak drawer.Setup was simple and well explained. I just had to make one small adjustment of the template of the slotted screws to make perfect dovetails on the first test sample on a piece of scrap wood.After that the oak side I cut fit perfect. I would suggest this tool for anyone wanting to cut accurate dovetails.One problem that I did have is the straight 3/8 bit carbide tip chipped, I never dropped it, and didn't run it into a nail or screw either. In all its a great tool."
1,WTF?!,"I purchased this template because I have serious space limitations and needed a small setup. What I don't understand, and hence the low rating, is why they machined this template to require a 2 7/8"" x 4"" x 18"" piece of wood to mount it to. While the 18"" and 4"" sides are not as important, the 2 7/8 side is imperative for the correct function of the template, yet that dimension of wood, or combination of wood, is unavailable as far as I have found. Given my modest wood working setup, I do not have the tools to fashion the needed block out of a tree trunk, so several months later I have still not been able to use this product. MLCS customer service was less then helpful when I inquired how they produced the block in their website's instructional video. Thanks for nothing, I have a $50 piece of machined aluminum collecting dust in my shed."
1,Bad improvement,"Had the original for years and loved it, the clip became stretched and lost it, new design falls way short, thumb hole does not allow to flip open, blade has a 1/2 in blank at base and cutting string is frustrating, got the original jr on eBay way to short, knife less thanks gerber"
2,PLASTIC,The Good:1. The blade has a nice design that comes sharp out of the box. The holes seem to create slight air pockets that slightly help the blade not to bind while cutting.2. Lightweight; it won't feel like you are carrying a rock in your pocket.The Bad:1. Cheap plastic handle that twists in your hand.2. Although you can sharpen the blade razor sharp it won't stay sharp for long.3. It is far too expensive for the quality. I would expect to pay no more than $10.
3,Nice knife but E-Z out did not work out of box.,I was very impressed with the reviews on this knife but not as impressed once I got the knife. The handle feels cheap but is strong just feels flimsy. The EZ out feature did not work when I got it so I will be contacting Gerber. The knife blade is very sharp and is cut perfectly I just have to open it with two hands right now. The back lock is great I had a hard time trying to find a nice knife with a back lock. The only drawback is where the clip is located it is a little uncomfortable to hold. However for the price I am impressed with the knife. I just hope Gerber will fix or exchange it for one with the E-Z out feature working. I will update once I contact Gerber.Pros: Sharp bladeLight weightLock backCons: Feel of the handleNot easy one hand opening (on mine)Placement of clip
3,Tomorrow's Gift - 'Goodbye Future' (Minority) 3 1/2 stars,"Band's 1973 second offering - as this was the short-lived jazz-rock / fusion band's final album. After their first self-titled record, Tomorrow's Gift was stripped down to a trio. By this point, all there was left in the band were Bernd Kiefer, Manfred Runup and Gerd Paetzke. As it turns out, I thought this lp sounded a bit more rocking. Which of course, is a good thing. Tracks that make for fine listening are are the eight-minute ""The Vulture Is Flying By"" (English translation), the sixteen-minute epic ""Naturgemas"" and ""Didden For Dunder"". Produced by the late - great Connie Plank. Should appeal to fans of Frumpy, Annexus Quam, Joy Unlimited and possibly even Siloah or King Crimson."
4,Good Camera but Amazon over charge,Guys:I just bought it from Amazon think that they should have better price but find out that Newegg's price much better with free shipping also. Hope Amazon will drop their price soon.
5,Get this camera,"I've owned 4 different digital cameras in the last few years, but this is the first one that I'm in love with. Compact, light-weight, 5 MP, brilliant screen, ultra-stylish, easy to use, and takes two types of memory (SD and/or Memory-Stick). Add to that the nifty green light bars on front which zoom back and forth when it turns on (reminiscent of a certain talking car from an 80's tv show) How cool can you get?Few things to note. The strap that comes with this camera is about 18 inches long...way too long for my tastes. The included memory is a very stingy and virtually pointless (in my opinion anyway) 16 MB.So far the only really bad thing about this camera has been my difficulty in finding a case that isn't too big. I've tried everything from a pda case, to a mp3 player case, to a small camera case and they're all too big and bulky for this little beauty."
5,Great little camera,"Got this camera as a result of the reviews on here. As a summary of what most of them seem to say. It's great, battery life is good, picture quality is spot on. I've even used both memory formats though I didn't think I would. The two problems that seem to have been noticed by other people is red-eye and the amount of time it takes to take a photo. Though I have had red-eye in photos it's never been a problem really and I've never really seen a camera that didn't have red-eye of some sort. As for time taken between shots, I've compared it to a 3MP camera and it was faster, it's slower than my previous camera but that was only 1.4MP which I think has something to do with it."
5,I love this camera,"This is a great camera. Very easy to download into the computer. Takes great, clear pictures. Nice size. Durable."
3,"Nice small camera, problems with on/off switch","I hae owned this camera for about a year and have taken some great shots with it. It is good basic a point and shoot vacation camera.What I like:-Small size and solid construction, except for the on/off switch-Good quality output/pictures for the most part-Good battery life and multiple card options (SD and Memory stick, although I only use one)What I don't like:-Switch on cover that slides back and forth to both turn off and on as well as protect lense is now broken and renders the camera unusable-Poor low light capability and performance-Poor lcd quality and small size-Poor movie mode that only caputes 320X240 movies-Menus are confusing and not usefulWould I buy again? I would not buy given what I know about the camera and the other better options out there right now."
2,Please read this befor you buy,This camera is great because of its size and ease of use. But only half of my pictures are in-focus. I have experimented with every setting and still can not get consistently clear pictures. I bought this for my upcoming honeymoon and wish desperately that I had not because I don't want any of those moments out of focus.At around $300 it may seem like a great deal but spend a few more dollars on a camera that gives consistent performance.
1,Ask for the seat covers,"Maybe it was my mistake as I thought if you buy a chair the seat covers come with them since I didn't see (Chair Only). Also, make sure you get the right height. I have to buy the chair and cover again."
1,rude,"they sent me no covers and when I called customer support, they told me to shut-up and then said I was a filthy animal and then hung up on me."
5,perfect,I ended up not needed it... but needed to meet a minimum amount of money for the order... or something like that.
3,Decent ethernet cable,"Item came on time. This is a decent cable, except that it has been a little tricky/difficult for me to unplug the cable from the port on my laptop for some reason."
2,Okay replacement,"Okay, but didn't work out for my computer. The picture shown was not what I rec'd in the mail."
1,Not what I thought I was getting.,"The item received was different than the one pictured. The picture shows ""Ace Hardware"" brand knobs that are black with a silver trim around it. What I received was all black with no trim and was a different brand. What is the point of having a picture of a different item? That is not very helpful when people are trying to comparison shop for something. On the flip side, this set of knobs was pretty cheap, so I guess I can live with them until they break like my original ones did, and by the look and feel of them, I don't think that will take very long."
3,It's Okay,"Not what I expected. Just like a review of the past, okay, not great. Haven't had a chance to use the product."
1,this book sucks!,"the diagrams are terrible. i challange ANYBODY who has never tied a fishing knot before to decipher a single one of the diagrams in this book. the pictures in the section on casting are even worse. UGH! i can't believe i listened to all of these five-star reviews. if you are a visual learner like i am, than please, listen to me when i tell you to AVOID THIS BOOK!"
5,Idiot's Guide for fly fishing,"We were very happy with our purchase. Also, the seller was very fair and upfront about the books condition. They found a small cut on the cover to a certain page. They told us about it and even reduced the price and sent it at priority mail."
3,macrobiotic community cookbook,I don't find the recipes very appetizing and there is no pictures to see how the meals look. There are heaps of ingredients I never heard about.
1,Too many wierd ingredients,"This cookbook would be fine if you live in a place where there are lots of specialty health food stores. For the average person, though, the recipies call for too many strange and hard-to-find ingredients. A recipie I just chose completely at random to prove my point calls for, among other things, kuzu, kombu, light miso, and sesame butter. There were just too few recipies in this book for which I could have hoped to obtain all the ingredients."
4,It IS what I needed,This product was identical to the one that was already on the bike that I have and meets my needs accordingly.
5,Riveting,"I read this in one sitting. It was extraordinary. I can't believe after reading this book a reviewer could complain the author did not provide cross-referencing and documentation. She didn't even know her birthday when she escaped. She is still in hiding, fearing for her life, and would not be at liberty to send a request for documents. She wrote a personal (not historical) account, from personal memory, and it was compelling."
1,This is obviously fiction,"Having spent some time in Palestine, working as an aid worker, I have to conclude that this book is a work of fiction. There are so many glaring inaccuracies that you would have to be quite ignorant about the geography of the West Bank, the political situation and Palestinian society to accept this book as some kind of truth.Yes, honor killings and attacks happen. Too bad that there are people willing to profit from that fact by trying to parade fiction as fact. This is not the first false account of this kind, and it will probably not be the last, as long as there are willing buyers."
5,Great story,This is a great story for every woman whether she lives in the first or third world.Couldn't put it down.
4,I like it,Is a must reading !!!! I admire Souad for her acomplishments after what she has gone through . Sadto say that this type of behaviour is still happening in some parts of the world
1,This book is a forgery!,"Honor killings are a real issue that deserve worldwide attention; however, this book is clearly a forgery, similar to Norma Khouri's ""Honor Lost."" (At least that book was better written and had fewer noticeable inaccuracies.)This book is full of numerous inaccuracies - not the least of which is Souad's claim that her sister is murdered by a telephone cord - in a remote West Bank village which couldn't have possibly had a telephone back in those days!For those who want a more thorough review, I encourage you to read ""Truth, History, and Honor Killing"" - A review of Burned Alive by Th?r?se Taylor, which can be found on the Internet.You will understand that Souad's story couldn't possibly be true."
1,Sadistic Fiction,"My sympathy goes to this lady for her burns and mental agony. Having said that, being a victim of violence does not give her a license to defame a society and create lies. Such brutality is rampant in the U.S. and in other ""developed countries"".This is could be a very long article, but I just want to make the point of refuting some of the ""facts"" in this book:http://www.antiwar.com/orig/ttaylor.php?articleid=5801"
2,not at all like i expected,"I really did not enjoy this book. It wasnt terrible but it was hardly believable. It seemed more like propaganda to slander Palestinians. I guess it was because I held such high expectations for the book that when i read it i was completely disappointed. It just feeds into the misconceptions about arabs and/or muslims that many westerners have. But it was good in the sense that it was full of drama wheather it was true or not, and it never really gets boring."
4,good show,"i like itcompletes the serieswatch and enjoywell made, easy to use, product shiped well and arrived on time"
2,Shocked by picture quality,"This is not a review of the content but of the DVDs' picture quality, which is mediocre. The picture is slightly blurry, like a bootleg or a very poor transfer. Yes, you can watch it, but it's not the quality you expect from modern-day DVDs. It's one thing if the video isn't digitally remastered, which this isn't, but this is poor even by regular standards. How could they release it like this? It's good to have the show available, but hopefully they will release another set that looks a lot better than this. Very disappointed in the quality of this."
2,These just don't cut it,"I so want to like these earphones, but the more time I spend with them, the more I dislike them. The bass is just ok, but more importantly, the sound quality is very average for the price. Like some other people said, I should blown away by these."
3,"Overpriced, Over-exaggerating ads.","After watching the demo of sound isolation of this earphone, I thought $212 was a fair price. However, most of the foams are worthless except for the yellow sponge things. They reduce the outside noise a little bit, but not as much as how I heard in the demo. Secondly, Sony is the first creater/investor of this earpad thing, and I didn't like the shure's idea of coping and adding the little sponge things, only that sony's fit on my ears better and actually isolated the outside noise. As for sound quality, like many sais in their review, it's good or okay for $212 earphone. It lacks bass, but I don't listen to Hip-Hop anyway,, but it's awful when I lesten to cello. Some said it sounded ""natural,"" but I disagree.Overall, it's okay but is disappointing, personally. The market price should be fixed, at least."
4,Fits perfectly in the Shure E4 series line,"These aren't available yet, but I tried them at the CES show in January. For those who found the E2 series lacking in high-frequency response, and the E3 series lacking in low-frequency reponse, but don't want to spend what the E5's go for, then the E4's are for you! Very nice sound, great fit in the ear, and extremely good at sound isolation - Even though there were hundreds of people milling around in a large, extremely noisy exhibition hall all I could hear was the music, even when played at a low volume."
4,Worth the money?,"Isolating:The 'isolating' claim is no lie. I can max my volume and not have to worry about the person next to me hearing ANYTHING. On the flip side, having volume at medium and using the foam ear pieces, i can't hear anyone else in the office. Even using the rubber pieces, I can only sometimes hear muffled voices when someone's talking loud.Sound Quality:My old headphones we're cheapy's and these sound nothing like them. Much more crisp, clear, but less bass it seems like (which is odd considering the claims). I'll have to play with the settings, but overall they sound much better.Worth the money? Yeah... I'd say so. But wait until they go on sale. (Buy.com had (or still has them) them for 170)."
5,Awsome,"When I first used them my comment was Wow!, these ear buds have the sound of large headphones. They are clear with lots of unobtrusive bass and very clear mid and highs. I rate the iPod earbuds a 1 and these a 5. I have other high end ear buds which I like so I am not just comparing them to the el cheapo iPod buds. The E4C's are not cheap. I bought them in a moment of weakness and I am now glad I did."
3,Reasonable product,"I like these but don't love them. I prefer the sound of my Koss KSC75s (especially when I place a slight pressure to them with my hands!). These cost one-quarter of the price, but I wanted some noise reducing phones to use at my gym (to drown out the crap they play there). I love the long cord and the angle of the stems on the body of the phones and the large set of covers that come with them. However, I wish they and other companies would pack more foam pieces as these always work best but are the least durable.I have bought quite a number of earphones in my search for the ultimate sound - I should have just saved all the money and invested in the type that require a personalised earmould. BTW, I have Ultimate Ears super.fi 3 studios, and the E4c's are much, much better. This is true with respect to sound (they provide a much broader sound-scape, nicer bass and hi-end) and construction."
3,"Good isolation, not sure about sound","I'm fairly capable person so I spent a quite some time trying to optimize these headphones. I've gone through all the plug types. I settled on the foam ones since they gave me the best isolation and sound.Before I start criticizing these headphones, I will say they saved my life from annoying loud-talking people at work.Regarding sound quality, I get more enjoyment from $50 Sennheisers than these headphones.In a crowded place, shures win.So if you are pursuing pure sound pleasure in your house or somewhere where you can control the background noise, I don't recommend these headphones. The bass is lacking (yes they are fitted properly) and it just doesn't sound as good.In noisy environments, these are great because you don't have to crank the volume up and damage your ear. The sound isolation is great."
2,"Great sound, but often defective","When the earphones work, you get amazing sound. Unfortunately I've had to replace them twice in just little over a year, once due to a fraying wire and the other time because of static in the left earphone."
4,Survived a trip through the wash!,"Still sound great. Accidentally left them in the case, in my pocket, with my iPod nano. Unfortunately I have to replace my iPod nano."
4,good sound but not perfect,"Bought this set after reading numerous reviews. I do think that the newer generation dual-driver ear canal phones probably do a better job of producing rich bass tones. With the proper fit in your ear canal, and some bass boost applied from my Ipod equalizer, what you get is an amazingly detailed mid- and high-frequency response, without any glaring highlights, plus acceptable mid-bass frequency response. To give Shure credit, they give you a great set of sleeves to try to find the one which fits your ears best. Like most people whose reviews I've read, I found the yellow foam sleeves to work best."
3,Will Be Using the Warranty.,"For some reason the volume is not equal between the right and left ear buds. There is a distinguishable difference in amplitude, as if the left earbud has a short. Otherwise the tone is great, though deep bass is a bit lacking. I love the wide range of sleeves provided for best fit."
1,How did Krups go SO WRONG with this one!?,"Bought this to replace a good, functional Braun coffee maker because of the thermal carafe & stainless/black scheme.1st, when you pour water in the reservoir, bubbles form in the window and you have to do addition to figure out how much water you have. I sent it back TWICE to have it repaired, the first time , it still had the bubble issue; the second time they replaced the water meter with the white model version (black on black) so now I can't even read the numbers at all, regardless of the bubble issue, which persists.2nd, the trigger to release the coffee spout broke about 100 pots of coffee into its life... now the coffee just dribbles out. Was this only intended for 100 pots of coffee? With a 1-year warranty, I would not think so. Perhaps they should give it a 90-day warranty so you know it will fall apart.Overall, not Krups best effort! Save the frustration and find another coffee pot. I'm still looking for one."
3,electronic issues kill a good coffee maker,"I received a Krups coffee maker for Christmas last year. It worked well other than operator head space, & made good coffee. If one forgets to check that the pot is empty, or starts machine w/o the coffee basket in place, besides catastrophic flooding of your kitchen counter, the electronics which are in the base of the machine get flooded & short out. After 8 months & several such occurrences our machine no longer works. While it would seem a no brainer that one should avoid such behavior, it also seems that designing a coffee maker with the electronics where they could easily be flooded with water would not be wise either. We did not contact Krups for replacement, though perhaps we should have. It made better coffee than our current machine."
1,Wasted that money.,"1. The only way you know how much water is in it is by the water guage. Too often bubbles slip into it and prevents you from knowing how much it in there.2. If the carafe is cool and you make only 3-4 cups, the coffee is not very hot.I have had a few Krups coffee makers in the past which have been good, this one stinks."
2,Don't buy it,I wish I had read the reviews before I bought also. It has the same problems as everyone else has stated. I bought a few months ago and it gets bubbles in the water chamber so I can't tell how much I actually have and the filter chamber has disengaged sometimes and caused coffee to go all over my counter and down the side of my cabinets. The latest thing is water leaks out of the bottom of the coffee maker and when I program my coffee to go off in the morning I have a nice puddle of water underneath my coffeemaker. I'm very disappointed.
2,NOT The Krups Aroma Control Thermal Coffee Maker of Old,"I had a great Krups Aroma Control Thermal Coffee Maker with Stainless steel carafe until it finally died after about 5 years of heavy use. It made great coffee and was easy to operate and pour coffee. The NEW Krups FMF5 10 cup machine is NOT THAT NICE. The coffee is fair, operation is just soso no big improvement but worst of all is the configuration of the maker, The electronics are at the base of the machine. If you have an overflow of any type it runs into the base plate then into the electronic panel/buttons. The machine is shorter and squared off, getting the pot out of the maker is difficult. pouring the first cup of coffee is simple and effective with the control spout but get close to the bottom, the pot must be turned almost completely upside down to pour coffee. It is awkward at best. If you had a great Krups coffee maker and looking at this model to fill your needs, KEEP LOOKING."
1,broken,"This was a wedding gift a little over a year ago. With one time daily use the basket is broken (It had been limping along for 6 months) and has always filled the water meter with bubbles so I had to get used to knowing how much water I was putting in by estimation. This is cheap, I am so sorry my grandma paid so much for this unit. She was trilled with it because she thought she was buying me a coffee maker I could have for a long time. I will be buying a bunn."
3,Ok but not great,"I like the looks of this black and stainless appliance and it doesn't take up much room on the countertop, but the operation and cleaning part isn't great. The pot is so small and it's hard to get the last of the coffee out. Hard to clean, too, since I can't get my big hand inside the pot to scrub. But the coffee I can get out tastes just fine and is kept hot for a long time in the thermal carafe. Average choice for the price."
2,Not designed to last,"A year of one time daily use and this coffee maker is already going in the trash. The swing-out filter ""hinges"" broke during normal use. Once broken, the filter now no longer stays in place and falls out when the carafe is removed. Hence it's ready for the wastebasket. On closer inspection, the entire filter unit is made of plastic, and the hinges are only a few mm's in diameter. Sturdier design needed!"
2,Krups FMF5,"This coffee maker is not up to the usual Krups standard. The latch to open the coffee filter doesn't always work. Everything on this machine looks and feels cheap-plastic.Also, why does Krups require you to purchase a new permanent filter with every purchase? Older model filters never fit in the newer models.If you fill the water even slightly over the 10 cup line (yes the instructions tell you not to) you WILL burn yourself when you take the pot out. The hot coffee will run right over the top of the carafe and onto the handle.I was always a loyal Krups customer, but will rethink my position on that when making my next appliance purchase."
1,Very Disappointing,"If you are considering this coffee maker because of its good looks, do not be deceived by a pretty face! I have wasted my money on two Krups Programmable coffee makers within two years. Both of the coffee makers ended up with issues that made them inoperable. The first one would indicate that the water reservoir was empty when it was full, and it would not brew the coffee. The second one just gave out on me! It goes on and off continuously and it does not respond to any of the buttons. I am now shopping for for a new coffee maker, but I can assure you that I will not be buying another Krups."
1,Worst Coffeemaker Ever,"If I could give this product zero stars, I would. Had it a week and the display locked the machine up. None of the buttons function at all, including the On button, so no time, no programming, no coffee. The display flashes 8888 in bright blue that won't shut off until you unplug it. Got it at a store, otherwise I would have read all the negative reviews on this coffee maker. I may never buy another Krups product if this is the new standard level of quality Krups offers. Shame shame, Krups."
2,It leaks,"This is our second Krup FMF5. It makes excellent coffee, has a thermos pot that keeps coffee hot, provides ""coffee interruptus,"" and can be operated without its water filter. However: (1) it requires conical filters, so you have to wet the filter as a chemist does to keep grounds out of your coffee. (2) It leaks -- it leaks unpredictably, and the useless water gauge with numbers so tiny a magnifying glass is required, is just one of the places where water leaks. Today, the useless water gauge was spouting. These cheap things made in China cost $100, so we are moving to a different brand."
2,Poor Design and Performance,"Not happy with this coffee machine. The swinging door started to pop open automatically after a few months. It was fixed under warranty, but that took 6 weeks. The water gauge doesn't work properly. Finally, the lid to the pot mysteriously broke. Not a well made product, but an attractive one.These machines are all getting on my nerves as they rarely last for years and end up in landfill. My next machine will be a porcelain Melita."
2,Poor Design,Evidently the people at Krups didn't try this coffeemaker before they put it on the market. The caraffe is hard to take out and put back in. It scrapes the lid every time. They say it keeps the coffee warm if you preheat the thermos but why then have a timer? You need a microwave handy if you want a hot cup of coffee. You never know how much coffee is left in the caraffe. Also you need to turn the caraffe upside down for the last few cups. I'm sure this is the last Krup's product I will buy.
1,multiple problems,"Bought this in Jan '07. Worked fine for about 2 weeks with just one problem: small puddles of water always formed underneath the coffeemaker sometimes with a slight coffee colored tinge. After the 1st 2 weeks the filter swing-out door stopped swinging out when the button was pushed requiring the door to be manually pulled out. From early on I had to be very careful how I poured water into the fill reservoir lest bubbles formed in the fill indicator tube. When that happens you can't tell how much water you've poured into the reservoir. About 6 weeks ago I swung the filter door out and it came completely off startling me as I wasn't using a heavy hand. Now, no matter how carefully I fit it back into the holding mechanism [ a job that's not easy to do] it comes completely off again very easily. I'm fed up and am replacing this pain-in-the-butt Krups machine."
1,Not Reliable - Otherwise Very Functional,"Product failed after 4 months. Initial feedback is the ""mother board"" needs to be replaced. Product has an excellant design, makes an excellant cup of coffee and practical with the thermal carafe but no one likes to go through Warranty to fix a consumer product. Never had a coffee maker fail short of 5 plus years."
2,A Extra Step,"Had a Krups for 10 year, could not have been happier, but it died. Thought I'd give the Carafe type coffemaker a try. I make 4 cups each morning. 4 cups brewed into the carafe end up luke warm. That means you have to pre warm the carafe with hot water. This was a pain in the B###. Returned it and went back to the hot plate type coffeemaker."
2,Not as good as older models,1.very difficult to read numbers in h20 reserve2.Creates bubbles in reserve thus making it even more difficult to calibrate how many cups one is making
2,coffee maker,"I am disappointed at the overall quality of this coffee maker. Specifically, I believe it brews too fast or the water temperature is not hot enough to produce the full coffee flavor. Although the coffee maker is new, it immediately got air in the water gauge tube making it difficultto add the correct amount of water. Also, the latch allowing the filter holder to open is faulty."
1,stay away if you use water to make coffee,"I am writing somewhat tongue in cheek but came to this section to replace this particular coffee maker.That should be warning enough. I felt I would be exempt from the problems other people had with the coffee maker because I would not get the base wet because,...well, I wouldn't! Ha! It got wet and the rest, and the coffee maker, is history, hurled into the trash with the last of its grinds. While it worked, it worked well and the metal carafe was wonderful as we seem to have a problem with glass......but that's another story. My college degree did not prepare me for the advanced technology needed to program the base- the temper/mental one that dies upon impact with water, or perhaps it was having some issues already. Needless to say, on a cost per cup basis, steer clear."
1,This Krups is Crap,"All the negative reviews you see here are true. I ignored the faults mentioned because it does make a decent cup of coffee, but it's just not worth the hassle. You've got better things to do than baby-sit a product than the manufacturer can't be bothered to improve."
1,Hate It!,"There is not one good thing about this coffee maker. The area to pour water is too small. The carafe is just totally made ""STUPID"". Coffee doesn't even stay hot for an hour...I wouldn't recommend this coffee maker to my worst enemy! What a waste of money!"
3,First one broken,I was dissapointed because the first one received was damaged. Amazon staff took care of thins tho and the next one I got appears to be OK.
1,defective coffeemaker,"I made the mistake of ordering a reconditioned coffeemaker. I will never do that again!!! I sent the first one back because it arrived chipped and cracked, then after 2 weeks when the replacement arrived I poured water into it and the water went all over the kitchen. I was pretty upset!!! Then I had to spend my money to send it back. He is supposed to reimburse me; we will see how that goes!!! I am not a happy camper."
1,Buyer Beware,"Coffee maker arrived in pieces and carafe top was broken on the inside of the carafe (broken before screwed on). Shipper promised to send a replacement but never did. I managed to repair with parts from my old coffee maker. When the seller found out about my negative review, they offered a 50% refund and store coupon to change the rating. I told them nothing short of a 100% refund would change my rating and they refused."
1,Disappointing water level malfunction,"This is our second time we have this coffee maker as the water level sensor malfunctioned the first time. It seems that we have another coffee maker that has the same problem within 4 months (no water indicator although the reservoir is full). Purchased the second time due to easily being able to clean the thermal carafe; however, considering going back to the old fashion method of glass pot. The beeping of the ""no water sensor"" and the machine not working due to the sensor makes it useless to pay such money for a coffee maker.Wide opening allows for cleaning the carafe so that no coffee deposits/discolorations are seen inside. Had previous carafes that discolored due to difficulty cleaning it which made the coffee taste differently. Not worth purchasing this coffee maker. If anyone else knows of a large mouth opening of the thermal carafe for easy cleaning please let me know. Thanks."
2,review of krupstypeFMF5,"BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF EQUIPMENT,BUT VER POOR PRFORMANCE.THE THE AUTOMATIC PROGRAM FUNCTON DOES NOT WORK. THE WATER CAPICITY GUAGE DOES NOT WORK. IT FILLS UP WITH BUBBLE AIR SPACES LIMITING ACTUAL MEASUREMENT. BREWED COFFEE ONLY STAYS HOT FOR NO LONGER THAN ONE HALF HOUR. THIS IS VERY POOR PIECE OF EQIPMENT AND SHOULD BE PULLED OFF THE MARKET. FIRST TIME I HAVE EVER BEEN DISSAPPOINTED ORDERING FRO AMAZON.COM"
1,Didn't last long.,This is the second Krups FM5 coffee pot I've had. The first one last a year with heavy use. The latest on I purchased lasted only five days. I hope the exchange (haven't received it yet) lives up to the reputation of the first one I had.
1,electronics die at 1 year - failed in the ON position - NOT SAFE,"Enjoyed the coffee. Didn't mind the bubbles in the water level glass, and a carafe that won't deliver the last couple of ounces. But just after a year of daily use, the electronics went. The on/off started flashing and could not be reset. With no water, and the on/off flashing, the heater element was on. Luckily, we were alerted by the gurgling sound made when you brew a pot and the water tank goes empty."
1,"Lousy coffee maker, not worthy of the KRUPS name!","My husband got this for me for Christmas, just 7 months ago. We got it to replace another Krups machine that we had for 8+ years and was still working, we just wanted the thermal carafe. This one is a pain to program, pouring spout is awful, very tempermental, and has a really annoying alarm. At least 50% of the time the automatic timer fails on ours. The controls stop working whenever they get a drop of water on them, which is often given the pouring spout and poor placement of control panel. This morning, though set up to work as normal, it made about half a pot of coffee and spilled the rest all around the coffee maker. Now, it won't work at all. HORRIBLE machine!"
1,"Hard to clean carafe, ends up smelling","Difficult to clean inside carafe with average sized man-hands, so you end up getting a coffee stain and funky smells/taste after a while.Also, I've grown tired of stainless steel touching my coffee. I've gotten rid of all my travel mugs with stainless steel because they taste so weird after being washed with dish soap.Other than that, the insulated part works OK, but in comparison to other coffee makers, it's not a stand-out by any means."
1,"Beware, could be hazardous!","I bought this coffee make just over a year ago and didn't mind it's bubble in the water indicator quirk since I used another carafe to fill it. Sometimes the door was hard to get open or wouldn't stay shut right...that I could live with. I started to notice coffee and water all over the counter at random times. I thought it was just my husband being a slob. The other morning he made coffee and went to work as usual. As I was getting ready to leave a bit later I heard a strange noise from the kitchen. The coffee maker was shorting out..the LED screen was blinking on and off and it looked like it was full of water. I unplugged it immediately and was grateful that I found it before a fire started.Other reviews have stated that this model leaks and with the electronics at the bottom, it could be a real danger. The most disappointing thing about this was that I probably would have had the same or better luck with a $10 model from WalMart."
1,Very poor design,"The pot spout was designed by the dribble cup inventor. When filling the tank, it is impossible to get the water into it without spilling water on the counter. The shape of the spout is what causes the problem.If you like luke warm coffee as my wife does, you will love this machine. When I read the instructions to determine where there may be a temperature adjustment, they say to heat the pot by filling it with very hot water and rinsing it before starting the brew! I have to do this every time I make coffee just to avoid a tepid cup. They know this is a serious problem yet attempted to fix the poor design with consumer intervention.I bought this because it had good reviews and came from a good manufacturer. Krups needs to remove this from the market."
1,Krups thermal coffee maker,"Buyer beware, we purchased a Krups thermal coffee maker in January and it has already stopped working. Do not expect much help from Amazon or Krups. Krups requires you to print out your own UPS label, package the product, and then ship it back with an expected repair time of 4-6 weeks."
3,Needs improvement,"I have owned two of these coffee makers so I have long time experiance. At frist I loved it, made a good cup of coffee. I always liked the thermal caraffe instead of a heated glass one, but it seems that both my coffee makers started losing their abilty to keep the coffee warm, after an hour if it was half empty or so the coffee would come out barely warm at all. My first maker started making a loud noise while brewing and started throwing out steam from the back, then eventually stopped brewing altogether. I was recently at my sons house and he has the Cuisinart grind and brew and 2hours later the coffee was still piping hot(untouchable hot) and he says it stays warm for a very long time."
3,water level meter not working properly,"The water level meter does not work properly. When u put water in a bubble usually gets stuck in the measuring shoot; therefore, u can't determine how much water is in the water reservor."
1,UNRELIABLE,"You will often find water all over your counter, coffee grounds dribbled under the caraffe, and a cup of tan tea in the caraffe. Cheap plastic connections make the door unreliable, so it tends to burst open if you are not watching the coffee maker constantly, and drain water all over the kitchen. An errant gound caught in the drain of the funnel will easily interrupt the ""coffee interruptus"" feature, too. Don't try to clean the plastic funnel or to order any replacement parts -- they are uncleanable and the parts cost more than the parts to a Japanese car."
1,Bad Macine,"Stay away from this machine. The coffee comes out weak and plastic tasting. The very first week the rubber feet of the machine came out and the machine became wobly. Second week, the water guage got an air bubble in it and therefore the water guage would not show accurate water level. It was within 30 days and I returned back to amazon. And am back to the coffee machine search again"
1,Plastic Smell Unbearable,"Do not buy this product, the coffee smells intensely of plastic, and Krups has no solution for it. Not to mention, they have awful customer service. I love all my other Krups models, but this one is a failure."
5,great coffee maker,"fast, keeps coffee hot , easy to use , good looking goes with other stanlees steel - makes a really good cup of coffe - saves money in comparison to single cup brewers- great price"
1,Garbage,Stopped working after 3 months. Complete piece of rubbish. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM. IT WILL STOP WORKING WHEN YOU WANT COFFEE AND YOU WILL WANT TO THROW IT INTO THE NEAREST STARBUCKS WINDOW.
3,Annoying at times but BPA free,This coffee maker is good when bubbles don't crowd the water gage- it's SO annoying when it does that as it's difficult to read how much water is in it. Another reviewer mentioned that they solved this by taking the piece out and blowing the air/water pockets out but this is also annoying to do when you just want to make some coffee (especially at 6am with a baby on your hip).I emailed the company to inquire about the chemicals in the plastic and they confirmed it is BPA free... if this helps anyone's decisions either way.
1,Many ifs,"IF you can open the Filter Basket Soft Release Button to add coffee grounds, IF you can see around the bubble in the Water Level Indicator to add water, IF you don't run away when the coffee maker sounds like a train is roaring through your kitchen, IF you can pour coffee holding the thermal carafe almost upside you will have a good cup of coffee. If none of this appeals to you, a courteous Amazon rep will tell you how to return it."
1,Not steaming hot,"This is the first time we have purchased the carafe type coffee pot. It probably will be the last. We've used it for a month and we can't get used to the fact that coffee loses its heat too quickly. Also, we were looking for a maker that you could set the night before. While this one does it, we can't use the feature because it's necessary to ""pre-heat"" the carafe with hot water prior to brewing your coffee. OK, it's not ""necessary"" but if you want to do everything possible to get the coffee hotter, then it is necessary."
1,Worst coffee maker ever,"We bought this atrocity 8 months ago. the thermal carafe does not keep the coffee hot for starters. The idiot who designed the program feature is laughing the whole way tot he bank. The cleaning cycle comes on every two months which is fine, however even after cleaning it 3 times with solution, the regular clock does not come back up unless we unplug it and plug it in again which means that it also has to be reprogrammed. the clock and auto program function are so ridiculous it is annoying. I would steer clear of this machine. Oh yes, and the top of the carafe doe snot come apart to clean. Again, Do NOT buy this lousy machine."
1,A huge disappointment,"This is the worst appliance I have ever bought. I chose a Krups thermal coffee pot because we loved the one we bought in 2000. How do I count the ways: First, the electronics are AWFUL. Second, it is impossible to pour into the water reservoir without spilling water. Finally, it is almost impossible to empty the carafe (after the coffee has brewed) without turning the carafe on its top--and often spilling it.I am on the verge of throwing it into the garbage."
