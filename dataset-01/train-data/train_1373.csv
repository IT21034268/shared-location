5,Great extra 2in2out for a great price,"I have another USB 2x2 from another company that cost 5x what this does. I got this little wonder for my laptop and to have another set of ins and outs so I could play along with a virtual synth to movie tracks and other music. Absolutely no downside to this little guy, if you don't count getting cords with RCA on one end, which I had in stock. The sound quality is excellent, the build is lightweight but appears sturdy. And the price is amazing for what is offered. Unless you're looking for studio grade equipment, this will do the trick."
1,Ruined a WIN7 PC,Installed this on a WIN7 Pro PC and could not get it to 'work' Then I uninstalled driver and re-installed Behringer driver. My WIN7 PC died and it took me 20 hours to repair the damage. Be fore-warned. I wanted to throw this piece of #$@^ against the wall but instead returned it to Amazon.
5,Excellent converter,This has outstanding quality. Together with MacBook Air and DJay software it provides basic DJ studio for some home parties and music experimentation. I have bought it based on Behringer product review somewhere else.
3,48kHz is NOT a hi rez sampling rate.,"The statement: 'High-resolution 48 kHz converters for high-end audio quality' is inaccurate. 48kHz is NOT a hi rez sampling rate. but for the price, its likely better than what is in the laptop.hifitommy"
4,A good substitute for a cheap sound card,"If you do karaoke or blast your music from a cheap computer sound card, this is the most economical way to take it straight from the USB bus. I have never used the inputs for recording so no comment on that. Most D/A convertors cost several times what this little device costs. I recommend the Behringer brand and this convertor to anyone on a budget and satisfied with high quality on a budget."
1,horrible buzz,"I've had a lot of trouble finding a usable device to get a line-in for my laptop. This was my second try, and unfortunately it did not do the job despite my expectations from so many good reviews on amazon. Loud buzzing accompanies every recording. Maybe i'm doing something wrong, but for me this was not a good buy."
5,awesome,"love twin peaks. and this poster fulfilled all of my expectations.... a bit small, but that just makes it cooler"
3,Eye Opening!,"As mentioned by another reviewer, it is hard to imagine how low a human being can go, until you recall Susan Smith drowning her own children. You don't need to be a Nazi to become so heinous.Great footage and faily good narration. I must admit is was a little slow and boring at times, but this DVD is a good reminder of what sinners we humans are and if not for the grace of our Lord Jesus, we would have no chance at all."
3,not all that great,"Wasn't all that great..the first tape was fairly predictable, and I did appreciate Serge & Beatte Klarsfeld tenacity. I guess I did not think it was anything that new I hadnt seen before.."
4,GOOD,"THIS WAS A GOOD DETAILED ACCOUNT OF THE HISTORY AROUND FINDING THE NAZI'S, AND ANY WWii BUFF WOULD ENJOY IT!"
3,Old documentary,Scenes remind me of why I need to put my uniform on even though I don't agree with war much.
5,as good or better than Turco,"Wow, this book has made quite an impression. There is nothing I can say to top what has been said already, but what I can do is add my two cents of approval. I actually prefer this book over Turco's Book of Forms. It reads better and explains the forms better. This books covers a wide variety of traditional and experimental forms of poetry. And Finch and Varnes pulled together a diverse group of poets, from R.S. Gwynn and Dana Gioia to Maxine Chernoff and DJ Renegade. From Anthony Hecht to Paul Hoover. There's Tim Steele, Jan Hodge, X.J. Kennedy, Agha Shahid Ali, Maxine Kumin, Charles Bernstein, adn Billy COllins. You get all styles of poets and poetry within. For any serious poet, this is a must have book. And it is loaded with great examples of each type it discusses."
2,AVerage Insights,"Some good essays, but most were undergraduate pieces from the 1950s,except the ideas were less compelling than they would have been in that era. Disappointing, but also revealing, because as always it would be better if poets just wrote poetry (unless your John Keats: see his letters) and stopped cluttering up the world with their prose."
5,Great book for everyone all ages,"This book is beautifully illustrated,and has good values.It shows children that one cannot be mean to others andprosper on that.Kindness and gentleness can make good things happen in everyones life.People have to prove that they're worthy of someones love and respect."
1,English title-Spanish written content,English title-Spanish written content. Not appropriate for non english speaking three year olds. would have been helpful if it was mentioned in a preface somewhere
1,BOOK TOO BIG,"I love this book. It was a childhood favorite of mine, so I wanted to buy it for someone else. When I received it, although it does state that it is a big book, I was not prepared for how BIG it really was. I retruned it and found a copy at a local bookstore where the regular size is already big (I thought it would be big like the regular copy). Other than that, great customer service."
5,best version of Cinderella,"This African ""Cinderella"" folktale tells a much truer message than conventional European versions of the story. As the sister of our heroine is also beautiful and intelligent, the central character trait praised here is not beauty or charm, but kindness and compassion. The stunning illustrations positively glow."
5,Mufaro's Beautiful Daughters,"This book is about these two sisters Manyara and Nyasha father of Mufaro. Manyara is the rude sister. Nyasha is the warm loving sister. One of them would be getting married to a king and the other will be their servant. Manyara well she wanted to get a jump start on things so when she was going to find the king she seen a boy (that was in need for food) that she refused to give food to, then she came apon a old lady she didn't listen to, she also met up with some trees that laughed at her and she laughed back at, and last she came upon a guy with his head in his arm.So if you really think people that are rude won't get far and their rudeness will just catch up with them later as they go threw life. This book has inspired me to be a better person in many ways. This book is an amazing book it not only expresses the persons outside feelings but it expresses the persons inside feelings."
4,African Tale,A nice African picture book with a solid moral. We read this for home school and as part of our study of Eastern Hemisphere cultures. The art work alone makes it worth taking a look.
4,It jumps around a little but it's very informative,"I like the book, it's informative and it's easy to find a topic. I don't like all the jumping around within the topics, it's like it's never focused on one point so you have a snippet here and then the continuation is someplace else. So I guess if you read the whole entire thing that's not a problem, but if you're looking for something specific it can be. Like for example I'm a single parent and male, and since info on that is all scattered throughout the book I had to read through the parts that dealt with mothers and married teen parents and non-custodial parents. I would have preferred clear topics, but this book is actually the best resource I have found and the most complete and informative."
4,Useful,Good ideas. Author is familiar with gardens and plants. I would recommend this book.It also had ideas re: pet enclosures that was helpful.
5,"Interesting Premise, Dog Friendly Gardens","I have been reading this book, and enjoying the information in it. I will soon begin to use the suggestions. Our Australian Cattle Dog Mix is a rapid digger! She can dig a substantial hole in only a few seconds...so, I will definitely be using some of the techniques included in this book."
3,Garden book for dog lovers,Okay. Not as much information specific to creating a nice doggy retreat. Lots of general garden information though.
2,Useless book,"An useless book. Let it where it is. No informations, no step-to step explications,no planting plans. Useful only for puppies or little doggies, non for big dogs. At me, it's only to waste money. Bah!"
4,great,"this was just what i wanted and needed. although there was some writing in it, the product was what i needed."
5,"Look no further, this should be yours!",We got this mattress for our 3 year old daughter and we cannot be happier with the product... We went back and forth between memory form and innerspring mattress and finally decided to give this one a try after reading all the reviews:-) The size of mattress doesn't bother me and it seems to fit nicely on her twin size bed. We had 4 in 1 Da Vinci Emily Crib that we turned into a twin size bed using the converter kit... Our daughter seems really comfortable sleeping on it and we occasionally do fall asleep on it and we like it!
3,Fabulous greeks,interesting reading but would not consider condition of book as very good. If we are talking about the paperback that I received. Many pages torn and binding lose at the bottom.
2,Disappointing,"I was mislead by the title (a critical review). My expectations was that this is the story of DP and what happened between mark II, III and IV. Not a clue. The dvd contains TV-recordings and some folks comments. I just expected some historical background, like what was actually the reason that Gillan and Blackmore are not excatly best friends etc. I got more background history from Coverdales homepage (and Glenn Hughes' as well). This is not a critical review. This is video from BBC together with bla-bla-bla from more or less unknown people."
1,"A ""bit"" dangerous","I couldn't wait to finally be able to use this expensive bit that has sat in my Raised Panel kit for years now. I followed all the rules. I purchased a high end router table and installed a 2 1/2HP variable speed router as recommended. It took about 12 passes to safely accomplish a single profile on one edge of a 10"" piece of poplar. Even with the smallest adjustments, there were still some break out and kick-back. I'll go back to my nice safe vertical raised panel bit. This bit looks great, very large, and it will end up being a very expensive display piece in my router bit collection. Stick to the vertical bits. I was very disappointed in this one, and it's definitely not worth the money."
5,Still laughing !,I had forgotten how funny these movies were and how marvelously inept and arrogant the inspector was. I think I laughed as hard at the chase scene in the Pink Panther as I did when I first saw it. I am sharing this collection with people who are not old enough to have seen them when they came out. They find them as hilarious as I do.
2,a poor box set!,"I am a huge Pink Panther fan, and this box set isn't a great box set.First off, it is missing ""Return of the Pink Panther"", which is one of the better Pink Panther movies. Instead it includes ""Trail of the Pink Panther"" which is basically the outtakes that didn't make it onto ""Revenge of the Pink Panther"". Sellers had died before it's making, and so you are stuck with a sloppy thrown together movie. The first movie (the Pink Panther) and Revenge of the Pink Panther are fair, and Trail of the Pink Panther is brutal.I would recommend buying Pink Panther Strikes again (Without question the best of the series), A Shot in the Dark, and Return of the Pink Panther. These 3 movies are the true stand outs, and you won't be wasting your time watching a ton of fluff.Just my two cents!"
3,"Just The Sellers, Please - Hold The Fakes","I'll stick to buying seperately the 5 classic Panther films done by Peter Sellers while he was ALIVE:1. The Pink Panther (1964)2. A Shot In The Dark (1964)3. Return Of The Pink Panther (1975)4. The Pink Panther Strikes Again (1976)5. Revenge Of The Pink Panther (1978)Don't want to see Al Arkin, Rob Bennini, Geoff Rush, Steve Martin or anyone else trying to PRETEND to be Sellers. Nobody else will EVER cut it, period.Thanks but no thanks? Qui!"
2,There's just no point,"There's simply no point in issuing a boxed set of Pink Panther movies that excludes RETURN. Why the heck didn't they just wait till they got the rights?MGM/UA Video clearly see's nothing but $$$ signs in their eyes and have done nothing but insult the public. But what's new, big corporations have been doing that for centuries.Trail of the Pink Panther is not even a proper movie. Oh yes, sure you can see outtakes from the other films and it could have been considered as bonus material but certainly doesn't warrent inclusion as part of the actual series.I say we should all boycott this boxed set and send a message to corporate greed. Don't be a fool and spend your hard earned cash on this incomplete set. You're just lining the pockets of the rich and letting them know it's ok to deliver unacceptable product to the public.Get it right or you don't get my money!"
4,Great for Whats here!,"Dear Inspector ClouseauI love the Pink Panther movies in this incomplete collection. Your alter ego Peter Sellers gave your wonderful character wings to fly.However, since ""everyone is a suspect"", I would suggest you bring on all the DVD clues to the table. All the missing films in the series like the Inspector Closeau (with Alan Arkin), Return of the Pink Panther, Curse of the Pink Panther (the last appearance of actor David Niven) and the Son of the Pink Panther. With these the collection is complete.So dear inspector, I enjoy the bonus disk of cartoons, but maybe it should have been you or the panther been on those disks and not other cartoons from the film library.Blake Edwards should have made some sort of commentary regarding the series since he created and directed most of these films.Well Inspector, I enjoyed watching these movies and laughed whole heartedly. I lift a glass of Pink Champaign to what is here in this collectionBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
4,Bonus disc not much of a bonus,"The Bonus disc contains one 30 min documentary on the making of the Pink Panther films, plus a few Pink Panther cartoons, and a documentary on the cartoons.Not much of a 'bonus'However, I am a fan of the series, and the films are great."
4,"""Kato! You Fool!""","Yea! I've been waiting for years for this collector's set to come out on DVD! But, where is ""The Return of The Pink Panther?"" Yes, all of the classic Clouseau's are here but, in my opinion, the best one of the series is left off because of some studio rights issues! There are some interviews with Blake Edwards and a couple of other people, (which are imformative) but I was very disapointed that there aren't any out-takes or gagreal extras! Besides that, it is a must have box set for any Clouseau lover..."
5,Pink Panther collection,This collection will keep you laughing for hours. Peter Sellers is at his best as inspector Clouseau. Hours of hilarity here.
3,"Good, except...","The DVD's are very good. But, one major problem, this isn't a complete set. It is missing one of the best films of the series ""The Return of the Pink Panther"". Apparently this has something to do with studio copyrights and what not, but I felt a little jipped since this is not mentioned at all. Otherwise a good set."
4,THE original!,"The original Pink Panther is a classic. True, the sequels are not as good as the first but they are funny too. Peter Sellers is the best. Still a laugh a minute...I could see the ""Does your dog bite?"" a hundred times and it is still funny."
4,"Missing Movie and All, Still a Hilarious Collection","The Pink Panther Collection has some week moments, yes, but all in all, still one of the funniest set of movies to be released...ever.Some of the gags in this movie go down in history as some of the most hilarious of all time, and some of the subtle little idiosyncracies of Peter Sellars made these films.My personal favorite, the Pink Panther Strikes Back, has some of the best sequences of any comedy I've ever seen, and there are funny scenes all of the films-with that being said, there are funny gags in the non-included DVD's, but this product warrants buying if you are at all a fan of the series, even a casual one like myself, you will come to admire how great these films actually are, and may soon accept them as what they are: films that ranks along side the great comedy series of all time."
3,its not the compleat set,its missing son of the pink panther and the return of the pink panther. buy the boxset ya get a 10 dollar certificate till june that you can use to buy the son of pink panther with making the son free it also has a 10 dollar certificate and the certificates can be used to see the new movie or buy the cartoons.
4,"What happened to ""Return of""?","Confused as to why this package would exclude ""Return of the Pink Panther"" which is SO much better than Trail of the Pink Panther."
3,"Pink Panther a hit, shipping a miss","I do have to say that I'm very satisfied with the 6-disc set that I purchased. I bought it as a gift, and the receiver was thrilled. It also arrived in good condition, which is great. But the time of the arrival left much to be desired. I ordered the product on February 21st and received it in the mail around March 9th. I paid for the standard 5-8 or so business days, and the note beside the product did say it would take up to 11 days to ship, but 17 or 18 days is a bit excessive. I would hope that in the future, this company--which was not in fact Amazon, but merely through Amazon--would be a bit more punctual."
1,pink panther film collection,3 sets of dvds sent not 1 as requesteddvds advertised as uk compliant were north america compliant$50 import duty had to be paid for wrong shipment
3,HDTV Plasma Users Beware,The H3D didn't work on my Pioneer PDP-502 MX Plasma display. It has a NTSC scaling DSP that I think is causing loss of sync with the LCD shutter glasses. I think that any TV that has a line doubler or some sort of scaling technology will not work with H3D.The effect was terrific on the JVC CRT television that I have in the bedroom.
5,WOW,"I got this as a Christmas present, 2002!! I love it. Go to the website listed on the dvd case and you can buy more dvds really cheap. (Slingshotent.com) I bought Jaws 3-d off of Ebay and it was good also. Make sure when you buy 3-d movies that they are used with your shutter 3-d glasses that you get with this kit! NOT The OLD RED AND BLUE GLASSES. Oh yeah.. You can hook it up to your VCR to watch 3-d tapes.. Such as Amityville Horrors."
5,Awesome on a Big Screen TV,"I have a 65 in. widescreen projection tv and the quality on theses DVD's are unbelivably great.The 3-D is outstanding!! I wasn't dissapointed in any of them. This system is the best. Just like any top-notch amusement park / simulator ride. The 3-D is right in your face.IF YOU OWN A PROJECTION / FLAT SCREEN TV, or it is a widescreen, don't be fooled by other reviews that tell you it won't work. It even says in the instruction guide that it won't work on flat screen and that it is only made for tube tv's. Well, that is simply not true becasue it owrked excellent on mine. Before returning it MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE CONNECTIONS correct and you have the picture adjusted correctly. Once it it set you'll be amazed.I highly suggest those with big screen tv's get this box set if your into top-notch quality home theatre special effects."
3,they day of this is gone unless....,If you only have a analog tv and somehow do not have a digital tv or even better a 3-d tv then this package is for you. But I don't know anyone in 2012 who doesn't have a flat screen tv. Or even a flat screen computer screen. This was a great deal back in 2001 though. And it cost alot more than it does now. But you are better off buying a 3d tv these days.
2,Not like people are saying,"I got this, based on the ""rave reviews"" everybody had. Was so excited and hooked it up, set it up per the menu, popped corn, sat back, tunred off the lights and ""WTF?!?!?!"". The picture was so blurry it gave me a screaming headache in ten minutes. Sure there are some decent 3D effects here and there, but the picture quality is so god awful it made it tough wading through the rest of the movies to get to the ""good parts"". I truly hope the new technology that is so freaking expensive is better and it damn well better be since I just dropped afew grand on a widescreen setup and ma waiting for the glasses.So, wait for my next review of the ""new"" 3D technology. For an HONEST average guy opinion.In this average guy's opinion, this one sucks. Some nice effects, but an almost unwatchable picture. I'd say wait for the next wave to catch on and prices come down a bit.....that or buy my setup like this one. I'll sell it really cheap, ha ha ha."
2,"Good idea, Lame content, Equipment limitations",The 3-D effect is poor at best. Common televisions scan/refresh rate is too slow. Each eye gets only 15 frames/second which is too low for fast motion. Even direct view CRT televisions show ghosting of images to wrong eye. The phosphors just don't have time to cool between frames.THE ANIMATED CONTENT ON THE INCLUDED DVDS IS TERRIBLE. Same roller coaster/mine train theme repeated over and over and over.One of the movies does have music video of live persons. Unfortunately it is ruined with lame floating bubbles and ghosts.Live humans in actual settings would be much more enjoyable to watch. First person point of view presentations of anything would be preferable to the garbage I just finished fast forwarding through.
3,Be warned!,"The i-glasses system included in this package is not compatible with digital TV's. The system is only able to sync up with the old style analog TV's (which most people own). If you have an HDTV or an HDTV ready TV, this system simply won't work."
2,"depth, but not 3d","i bought this today (razor 3d the ultimate 3d experience) and have tried 3 dvds with it, used all the different settings, and so far it offers more depth perception, but is definitely not jump-off-the-screen 3d. i was using a regular tv.. 32"" crt sanyo, and again i could tell a difference in depth but it is confined to the square boundary of your television.. it is absolutely not come-out-of-the-screen at all. plus it kinda hurts my eyes. i was disappointed"
2,Not to impressive,"After reading the above review, I have to say I disagree. I own a HD 57"" sony, and the image is pretty poor. First of all, it(the 3D unit) is run through standard RCA cables, not Component Video, which may lead to some of the poor image quality. Dont get me wrong, the ""3D"" did work to some extent, but it was VERY blurry, even after adjusting all settings on the TV and the 3d transmitter unit. I have a Sony Wega 32"" in the bedroom that I havent used for the 3d yet, perhaps the quality will be a bit better, but on the HD set, it was kind of a let down.Its a great idea, and neat novelty item, but I guess I was just hoping for a little bit more...."
1,The Ultimate 3-D Collection H3D Viewing System,"Well....I'm not happy with :(The DVD's are cool indeed but the so cald H3D Viewing systemi don't like, why ?!Sure i can see depth, sure i can see 3D with it,But, NOT like in the pictures on the H3D Viewing System Box, nothing comes out of my TV or the so caldcome-off-the-screen effect, that's for sure...And it's NOT that i plugged it wrong !Or... i have bad eyes :)"
4,Ephesians,"**** Ephesians has been termed the Queen of the Epistles, a symphony of the New Testament, and of all the maestros to conduct that suite, James Montgomery Boice is among the most adept. Putting deep theological concepts into layman's terms in a readable fashion without dumbing it down takes a master's touch. That is what you find in this book. Using the rest of scripture to interpret Paul's letter as well as Biblical and modern history, Dr. Boice sheds new light on the ancient text. Yes, there are a plethora of books coming out that tear down sacred texts, but the reader would be far better off diving into an intelligent work like this that illuminates. ****"
4,Great condition,I bought this book to go along with a homemade Paddington stuffed animal. The book was in great condition.
5,Gould - live and unedited,"These wonderous disks capturing Gould in concerto and recital live from Sweden make you want to question Gould's won preference for studio recording. Without the editing process, we hear 'one take' Glenn, free and spontaneous. The Beethoven 2nd concerto has more fun and sparkle than either the live Leningrad recording or the studio disc with Bernstein. The music making is pure joy throughout, sunny, happy and played to perfection.The Mozart C minor (one of Gould's most inspired interpretations) is a lighter and less intense than the brooding studio recording. The Haydn and Beethoven have their moments, but Gould went on to rediscover Haydn towards the end of his career with more obvious relish.Of course these are live, unedited performances. Not a note is out of place."
5,Works Great! Shipped fast!,I needed this for my kegorator. I have a keg of Pilsner Urquell that does not use the US Keg coupler D system but uses the S System. I was happy that is was delivered quickly. One note: The top connector is a different size than the US Keg coupler so you will need to change the beer line nut also. The CO2 line fit just fine.
4,Asking The Right Questions,"The question and answer format of BIBLE PROPHECY helps to keep the reader focused. Of course the quality of the reading experience depends heavily on the relevance of the questions. In this respect I think that the book is a success. It is also written in a very readable style. Erb's background includes jobs as a teacher, writer, preacher and churchman for the Mennonite Church. His interpretation of prophecy reflects his training."
1,"Libs Protect Al-Qaeda By Terming It An ""Idea""","In ""KerryUtopia,"" Dowd zeroes in on what most Americans already know or increasingly suspect: that Kerry Jr. is a hopelessly provincial, empty-headed and simplistic straw man who likes to pose as the Marlboro Man while being manipulated by Machiavellian advisors like Michael Moore and the whole pathologically deluded entourage who got us into this foreign oil quagmire, now known as the ""liberals in the Senate and Congress"" as well as the extreme terrorist-aiding left who in exchange for electoral support now get to write 90% of Kerry's social policy positions."
1,"Libs, Stop Emboldening The Enemy With Opportunistic Fraud","This anti-American propaganda shows better than any I have read that W is not a practical minority coddler. It even starkly compares W with the Pope and shows that even for 41s politcal problems, he still had an idea what tax cut bill to filibuster. With W, she shows a man yet to reach his peak, relying on trial lawyers with agendas and class-warfare goals rather than what is best for the country. It shows W as a product offered by the left propagandist, and not as a leader who knows anything of the nuances of poll-based policymaking. W is no Clinton...hes head and shoulders above. If you read this, you'll see it too. Torturous read."
1,A Swing and A Miss for Ms. Dowd,"Too bad Ms. Dowd must be constantly cute in this book to make her point. Some real information instead of sarcastic innuendo would make this refreshing. Some of it IS kind of funny, but most of it has been said so many times before by comedians. Hemingway, she ain't. If you dislike our current President and NEED a sarcasm fix, then buy this book, otherwise save your money and send it to your favorite political party...a better and more useful way to express an opinion."
1,Mortification From Libs Who Delude That Scheuer's Bipartisan,"It's time to head down to the Fuhrer Bunker, John Kerry. To sum up Bush's agenda, the United States should be declared a shining example of democratic excellence. Jeremy Jones is a complete, 100%, democracy hating nut. His projection of the conservatives' psychological condition actually applies to him. It is safe to say that he has serious problems, he is so out of touch with reality that he should be serving as one of Kerry's advisors."
1,Not impressed,"I don't have strong political affiliations so I usually enjoy political books of all views. However, I wasn't impressed by this one. I prefer political books that are more grounded in facts instead of the author's humor and bitterness. There are much better ones out there."
5,Sobriety in a time of mass-suggestion,"The main difference between father and son Bush is that the father lived in our reality. Dubya lives in a created reality. He is constantly surrounded by cheering crowds and supportive advisors. In this world, Dubya sets the agenda, he sets the rules. It is a kind of relativistic universe where the ruler's that measure Dubya and Kerry are of different length. Dubya's falls from his mountainbike, absence from his military service, drug habits, gaffes, etc., just shows his greatness, while every time Kerry shows that he not quite has the wisdom of Confucius, the intelligence of Einstein, and the strength of Conan the Barbarian it proves that he is unfit to be president.This book is a must for the undecided voter, or even for the soft-core republican who knows that something is wrong, but cannot really identify what."
1,Only Moronic Liberals With No Appreciation For Facts Allowed,"Since 9/11, it seems as if George W. Bush has basically ""converted"" the entire Middle East. From the now-fawning Syria to the reliably neo-con Iraq to the shrill Iran, lefties look far and wide for terror-states from the so-called ""hub of terrorism."" But thankfully, we still have Maureen Dowd and Paul Krugman. Their columns, scathing and ruthless towards the current war effort, are a cause for both right-wing rage and left-wing worship. Now Ms. Dowd (who on tv seems like a shy, mild-mannered prosstitute) has put out a libel piece, a collection of poison-pen columns about the uniquely efficient, genuine, yet strangely unpraised world of the Bushies. She calls it ""Bushworld"" and says ""we just live and thrive in it""."
1,Fantastic!! I only had to read this to become self-hating!!!,"In ""Kerry Apocalypse"", Dowd compiles her columns in the New York Times since Bush appeared on the national stage. Dowd writes with a psychosis that can be just a hazy memory to, well, a certain liberal news station who had conditioned their hard-core base to confuse scorn for wit. Dowd is not like that; this book is the real thing."
1,Only Moronic Liberals With No Appreciation For Facts Allowed,"i am now such a maureen dowd stalker! this woman is by far one of the best maniacs i've ever had the pleasure to scorn. witty, astute, scathing in her glorification of the current conclusive-elected president...not to mention his (or should i say his daddy's?) administration, the guys who are really following Bush's orders in washington, dowd has completely captured the essence of mastery displayed daily (hour-by-hour? every other minute?) by the man who is our president."
1,NYT Writers: Demagogues For Islamofascists & P.C; DANGEROUS!,"In ""Kerry Apocalypse"", Dowd compiles her columns in the New York Times since Bush appeared on the national stage. Dowd writes with a psychosis that can be just a hazy memory to, well, a certain liberal news station who had conditioned their hard-core base to confuse scorn for wit. Dowd is not like that; this book is the real thing."
2,Another IMUS best seller!!!,"Had it not been for Don Imus' plug of this book on his morning radio program, this book would have fallen into the 99 cent rack along with the rest of the political agenga driven books that bash present and former Presidents. I really wish Imus would exercise more srutiny with the books he chooses to endorse. Most of the time he is right on with his recommendations as was the case with Tim Russerts recent book. He should know that anyone writing for that overrated rag New York Times is going to put a left leaning slant on everything they write. This book is just another ""campaign tool"" used by the liberal democrats just before election time. Good timing, perhaps Ms Dowd and Mike Moore would like to donate some of the proceeds of their successes to the fallen soldiers they so claim to care about."
5,Right On!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book was wonderful! The arrogance of our president and this administration is unending, but will be on November 2nd. And America, look at your pocket book, are you better off? Look at a gallon of milk, gallon of gas, the deficit, the lack of respect we have in the world, lack of jobs...WE ARE NOT BETTER OFF!!!!!"
2,Too disjointed and partisan,"As someone who despises Bush, I should have loved this book. I didn't. I felt like it was written for morons. It had all the intellectual content of a Moore, Franken, Coulter or Limbaugh book. I think I lost 3 IQ points by reading it.The book tends to make the same points (and jokes) over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. For people who love reptition or political hatchet-jobs, this screed will be a windfall."
5,Brilliant writer,"She summarizes complex concepts into such clever and insightful, often biting, comments -- she's an absolute pleasure to read. Her introduction is a must read before the elections.A paraphrase of her recent op ed gives a flavor -- Cheney essentially said ""vote for us or die""... soon he will take it to the logical conclusion ""vote for us or we'll kill you."""
5,Contrasting differences in 41 & 43,"This book shows better than any I have read that W is not a practical policy person. It even starkly compares W with his father and shows that even for 41s politcal problems, he still had an idea what was going on and who to trust. With W, she shows a man in over his head, relying on characters with different agendas and ideological goals rather than what is best for the country. It shows W as a product offered by the right, and not as a thinking leader who knows anything of the nuances of practical policymaking. W is no Reagan...hes not even in the same league as his dad. If you read this, you'll see it too. Excellent read."
2,Mislabled for sales purposes... probably,"The Nintendo Plug appears to be for that of the N64. This is likely a leftover cable from 5th/6th generation systems. I'm not sure about the XBOX plug, but the Playstation plug is designed for the PS 1 and 2 and will probably work with 3"
1,sent wrong cable,This cable was supposed to be good for Game cube. The one they sent doesn't fit in the game cube. It's totally useless.
1,Do not buy this for PS2 or GameCube,"I bought this cable to play a PlayStation 2 and GameCube on an HDTV. It's advertised to work with a GameCube and it doesn't even plug into one. Nowhere on the package does it say it will, so what's on the site is false. Plugging into composite ports gave me just as bad a picture and no sound as the original PS2 composite cable does and plugging into component gives me a decent, though black-and-white picture with sound. Do not buy this cable if you're looking to use it for a PS2 or GC!"
4,Good,"I had some trouble getting the plugs to fit properly at first, but it eventually fit. Once it did fit, everything worked well. I used this for my PS2."
2,Better see Kill Bill and Storm Rider,"Sonny fans, want to see Sonny Chiba, better see Kill Bill I & II Or Storm Rider Or Explosive City."
5,Easy Greasy,I have bought this product from my local Wal-Mart before but they had discontinued it. Too bad Wal-Mart because this is a great product for the African-American culture. I am glad that I found it once again. It works wonders on my hair.
5,#1 is Right!!!,"Oh how to descrbe this Album...Electro/Glam/Punk/Synthpop...as veried as it sounds it works incredibly well. Yes, ""the 15th"" is a great song but did you know it is a cover version originally done by the punk group Wire?...I have to say my favorites are Sweetness, the future club anthem (and single) Emerge, and the quite Tone Poem. I have had this import for close to a year and have been able to turn all of my friends onto it no matter what knid of music they are usually into. Pick up the domestic when its released this week."
2,way over rated,"This CD is terrible overall (track 2 ""15th"" is quite good) and way too expensive, import or not. my friend has it and i would not even waste a blank CD to burn it, if that tells you anything. it's noise. but people that are into the squarepusher/add N to(X) type of stuff will really like it, maybe. or maybe start off a little more subtle w/an artist like dj hell, miss klitten & the hacker's ""first album"", or even anything by tiga."
4,"Older program, but solid and fun practice for kids","My 3rd grade twin boys use this everyday to practice their spelling words each week. They enjoy playing the 3 games to get enough points to make it to the Spelling Bee. There are 5 levels that the kids can work on with all of their spelling words. The 5th level spelling bee is in front of the White House. The spelling bee opponents are funny-looking robots that the boys still laugh at when they see them.You can create your own spelling lists and activate and inactivate each list for that level. Since it is an older game, the graphics are very simplistic and I have not found a way yet to delete older saved games, but overall it is a great game for practicing spelling."
4,Spellbound,Bought this game for my son. Still had most of the other learning company games from when I was younger. He loved them.
4,Old but still great,"I am still using the 1993 version. I used it with my first grandchild. I am still using it with my 5th, who is in 4th grade. They have all enjoyed the interaction, the games which are still in sync with their classrooms. They appreciate the instant feedback and the extra bonus points when they hit 100%. Would someone please update this for newer systems and older grades. I have also used this in teaching situations for remediating students who are far behind."
3,Recommended to Me via CFS Board,"I have a polyneuropathy-based fibromyalgia and Ribose treatment was recommended via a Chronic Fatigue board I subscribe to. The particular treatment dosage used was 5 grams three times a day for three weeks. After that, the dose was lowered to 5 grams twice a day. If possible, the dose was lowered further based on the individual; some people only need 3 grams twice a day to prevent fibro-fog and fatigue. The end goal was to take the smallest effective dose.I am not a medical professional and I have not yet tried this treatment. I am about to buy this product and will update this post with my personal results."
5,This is a quality cable that inexpensive...,"Bought two HDTV recently and needed to reduce the number of cables for the 5 cable Component connections to HDMI. At the local retailers, they were selling these cables that were way over priced and unless your planning to string 100 mile cables unnecessary. Paying over $150 for a cable was crazy and a total rip. The cables I ordered worked extremely well with my sets producing beautiful High Definition. One cable provides connections for video and audio. HDMI and Component connections are the only way to get HDTV."
5,Book will open up a whole new LEGO world,"This book and all of the software on the CD are INCREDIBLE. All of the tools make it so that you can build virtual versions of just about anything you ever dreamed of. If you like the way it looks, you can then go ahead and build the real thing with a complete set of instructions that you already made with all the software. This also makes it easy to share your ideas with friends on the Web. You can post your instructions w/ all the images. It allows you to create so many more robots (both virtual and ultimately real) than ever."
3,Disappointed,"Book was not as advertised. Entire book was curled, dirt and leaves were between the pages. Not happy with my purchase. I would NOT do business with this seller again."
3,One of his better books,"and better than most about True Crime, but still a collection of ""stories cops tell each other."" The plot is structured like a Medieval tragedy of revenge--you know what's going to happen at the beginning & have to wait to the end to see it. It isn't a novel; it's a docudrama, because many stories are drawn from headlines. Some have appeared on TV, in various cop shows. Characters are cops the author has known, but, as usual, Waumbaugh is incapable of portraying women, except as tramps or whores, so females are cardboard cutouts. Waumbaugh writes adventure stories for boys, like Hemmingway & Joseph Conrad, but a good adventure can be a good read; this one is. Interesting for its lore, Waumbaugh's confessional references to the Classics, and the experience of watching him learn his craft. And there's a moral: The true danger of police work is that ""those who fight monsters must take care not to become monsters."""
2,Choirboys,"The book was raunchy although once I got into it, I liked it. But after a while, the raunchiness got to me and I quit the book and just read the epilogue. That told mostly what would have taken pages to read. I hope cops aren't really as portrayed in this book."
2,The Choirboys,"I am not a police officer, but I have read most of the author's books. He is a dark writer. There are no heroes in his stories, only losers and whiners. Even the police dogs are not spared; in another of his novels, one gets run over. The Choirboys focuses on L.A. police officers with lots of personal problems and no hope to solve them; one commits suicide. They are portrayed as one-dimensional characters with no life outside of the patrol car or the party hang-out. One good thing, he discredits once and for all the notion of the ""John Wayne"" model of the policeman in the character of Roscoe Rules. His fictional novels do not promote a positive image of police officers, though, even if they are factual."
1,Rude & Crude ZERO stars,"Twas nothing but 5th rate trash. Foul language, foul behavior. 4th grade/writing reading level. Gutter level in content. Degrading Nothing funny about amoral Cops drinkin' & porkin' everything in sight.The author claims ""This is the truest novel I've ever written"". Maybe so BUTT all it is is a bunch of cops(LAPD) endlessly screwin' fartin' pissin' dumpin'humpin'pukin'whorin'swearin'jackingoff schemin'on pokin'pussy............... I mean like hey, whadda you trying to say ?Nothing funny about SICK COPS!I mean like hey, whadda you trying to say ?"
5,The Writing Process for Young Children Made Easy,"If you teach writing for young children, this book is a must! I shared it in a writing class I was teaching and everyone wanted to purchase their own copy. It has great ideas for writing and making books, but the best part is the way the writing process is presented. As teachers of writing we sometimes struggle to make clear the differences in revision and editing for young children. This book gives terrific teaching strategies for being successful. It's a must for the teacher of young children (Grades K-3)."
2,Meh - the writing isn't very good,I was disappointed in how much of this book just comes across as trite and self-justifying. I wouldn't buy it again.
4,Good map of key points of interst.,"Front of large fold out map shows Schnellbahn-Netzplan, U-bahn and S-bahn routes. Author numbers points of interest and describes them on the back. Back has brief description of points of interest, and a 2""x3"" map of each point. You still need to know what you want to visit based on prior research. U-Bahn maps for BMW Museum, Hofbrauhaus, Englisher Garten, Marienplatz and other locations are shown. Worth the cost."
1,Usage versus price,"I didn't find that this map was of any use, versus the map. A standard map given free by the Information booths cover almost all, and are free. The paper is thin, so that with slight usage it wrips along the folding edges."
1,Out of date - Obsolete,This subway map is useless as it is about 12 years old and the subway lineshave changed greatly in Berlin. A waste of money.
3,"We'll see how useful it is ""Over There""","This ""guide"" has the look & feel of a freebie handout, so $5 seems pricy for it. The big accordion graphic of the U- & S-Bahn system & very brief how-to-get-there (& why) directions on the backside may prove more useful than I'm expecting them to be. I'll be in a better position to judge this product's worth 2 weeks from now, after Berlin."
3,interesting people's stories from deep inside India,"Half a dozen stories from the heartland of India. People's stories, everyday men and women who make the bulk of India's billion+ nation. The stories are uneven in interest and excitement, and are not really integrated into one coherent whole. However, they do provide some insight into changing India in the 1980s."
1,not good,"I did not read this book as a true fan should never look into this book. If you want to know the history of slipknot, then buy the book that was actually put out by roadrunner and authorized by the band. One reason that they started putting on the mask was to freak you out, why take away that by wanting to know what they look like. Plus, if you are a fan, then you already know what they look like from some of their side projects. Also they wear mask to make sure that punk butt kids don't bother their familys and them when they are out and about. Please, respect the band and respect their familys. Don't buy this book and be a poser."
2,Not quite what it seems,"I had been looking for a small home theatre system that did not require wires spider-webbing themselves under carpets, through the walls, and into the basement. In considering a few 2.1 options, I really liked the Denons (S-101 and S-301), but the prices were -- and still are -- ridiculous. However, in my research, I came across the Sherwood system. I have had the Sherwood VR-670 for nearly a year, and the DVD player component is not operating properly. Inexplicably, the drawer will not open after several attempts, then mysteriously opens. The system has caused stops/starts in every DVD I have used in the last several weeks. And, trying to reach service or technical assistance is nearly impossible."
1,"Good sound, good price, but still not worth the money","As other reviews have noted, the DVD player is very unreliable. I had the unit for six months and the frustration level has reached the point where I am replacing the unit. I can not play DVDs received from Netflix without numerous problems. The DVDs will play fine on other DVD players, however. I have also had a significant problem with interference with my cable remote control. Changing channels with my cable remote will change the volume on the Sherwood. One time it will go up, next time it will go down. With the problem with the remote and the poor performance of the DVD player, I can not recommend it to anybody, despite good sound quality and a low price."
4,System sound all that you can expect but the Remote...oh the remote!,"We've owned this product for about four months and it has been everything it was billed to be. Don't expect 7 speaker sound, but it does have the capability to bounce sound off close-by walls and does a nice job of imitating bigger system sound. But the remote is lacking, or rather the way the system interacts is. We have DirectTV and there is no code for the Sherwood system therefore we still need both remotes. When you channel up on the DirectTV remote, the sound increases or decreases rapidly, and no manipulation of the controls will stop it. So you must have both remotes in hand when changing channels. Very frustrating. The sytem overall has smooth lines, small footprint and we've been happy with the richness of sound in a smallish family room. At top volume it has significant distortion, but you really never need the volume above 14 or so."
2,Erratic DVD problems,"I also have had this VR670 18 months, and now we cant get more than about 45 mins into a dvd and it freezes up. Same issues others note in this forum.Closest repair facility is 45 miles away. Not good. Sound is great, but a home theater has to play dvds to make the theater happen. Otherwise, it is just an amp."
4,Great system for the price,Just got the system works real great for the price. Simulates surround sound pretty good. Perfect system for a bedroom unit.
1,poor customer service,"We bought this system in January. Right out of the box, the buttons did not work. You could only control the unit with the remote, so heaven help you if you couldn't find the remote. By February, it was having trouble playing DVDs.Sherwood will not refund your money, their policy is that you have to take the unit to a repair shop. So we did, in February. Now it is May, and the repair shop still has not received the parts they need to fix the unit."
2,Unreliable DVD player,"The set up is easy and the sound quality is great for the money paid as promised. However, the very first day that I received this product, the DVD player failed to function consistently. Sometimes it could read DVDs (including DVD+R, DVD-R) but sometimes could not. Those movie DVDs are US region coded and have been played by other DVD players perfectly. When it could read DVD, it never finished a movie but stopped in the middle. It never has a problem with CD, CD-R, VCD though. But, how good can it be when a DVD player doesn't work properly even the sound is good?"
3,"Good looks, decent sound, questionable reliability","I've had this unit for about 2 years. After about 18 months it started having problems reading DVDs - even brand new, commercial ones. Would try to load for several seconds and give an error. After much back and forth with Sherwood they decided they would fix it if I sent it to them and paid shipping. I did so, and they fixed it for no charge. It's working much better now. The whole process took several weeks though which was a big pain. But it looks good, the sound is decent and it's nice not having to deal with wires."
3,some problems,"I have had this unit for a couple of years now. The manual buttons other than the DVD load and unload, do not work. touching any button turns the unit off. I did not notice this until after I had it for a few weeks, because I always used the remote. So I guess it doesn't matter.I notice volume changes with 5.1 sound when I use the TV output into the AUX connector. I don't know if it is the TV or the Sherwood causing it.Next time I will buy a 5.1 or 7.1 system."
1,Sherwood VR-670,"We have had this system for about a year. Sound is OK, but DVD player is basically junk. It worked for several months, then began to malfunction. The DVD player seems to have a mind of it's own. Plays perfectly sometimes, other times we have to just let the DVD play on it's own.The DVD would not respond to any commands. We could not pause, or stop the DVD. Now the system won't play a DVD all of the way through, it just stops. I have a call in to Sherwood, but I don't expect any satisfaction from them. I would not recommend this system to any one. The price is cheap, and so is the product."
3,Sherwood Home Theater,"I had purchased the unit from Amazon and it arrived quickly. The instructions can be a little hard to understand for a novice as they do not show set up for cable boxes specifically. Since most homes nowdays have CATV, it would be beneficial to list CATV setup. The sound was of very good quality for the first couple days. While listening one evening, it sounded as if a speaker fell off the wall and the unit shutdown. When I powered it back up it would shut off after about 5 to 7 seconds. I called Sherwood and they were of no help and just told me to return to Amazon. I returned to Amazon and got a replacement and that has been working okay for the last week. (Fingers Crossed) I like the sound, just am not sure yet on the dependability or lack of Sherwood Support. Of course I can buy 5 of these for the price of the Bose 123 and I cannot tell the differece in sound quality."
2,"Good sound , good looking but unreliable","I purchased this system three months ago. First impression out of the box are positive. The fit and finish are very nice. The instruction manuel is easy to understand and setup and installation was a breeze. Soundwise it performed very well, just like the previous reviewers have mentioned. It's not like a full blown five speaker system but for the small footprint it a fair tradeoff. Here comes the bad, the dvd player started malfunctioning the very first day. It turns on when it wants too. Sometimes the tray opens somtimes it does not. It will freeze and won't work untill a couple of days later. Customer service very hard to contact and to this day have not resolved."
1,Junk,"Difficult to open DVd player, subwoofer useless. Save your money. You truly get what you pay for"
3,Alright for few pennnies,Its really a Kids book with some drawings that would keep a 10 and under very happy to share with his or her friends!
5,Superb performance of a little-known choral masterpiece,"As a sometimes choral singer, I have long known Handel's ""Dixit Dominus"" as one of the most difficult pieces Handel wrote for singers, and one of the most difficult in the choral literature.The music is a masterful setting of one of the bloddier psalms, 110, talking about how the Lord will wreak various kinds of horrible vengeance on your enemies. The music is fast, large vocal leaps, very complex with chant melodies overlaid by agitated choruses.The performance is superior. The orchestra is precise and the chorus captures the bloody intensity of the music while hitting all the notes precisely (not easy with 16th note octave leaps!).This recording is one of my most treasured--I'm sure that people who enjoy choral music will fall in love with it too."
5,awesome,As expected and very happy with. 2 tracks unable to get on US versions. wish there were more out there like it
5,Should Be A Classic,"It's so strange that so few people seem to have ""Be My Guest"" in their collection of classic scifi. It's probably one of the best scifi stories I've read. A lot of people have heard of ""To Serve Man"", but this short story is one of my faves. Most of the stories in this collection are incredibly unique, and will leave you wondering how on Earth a person could think of such intricate and emotional problems people could find themselves in. It's great."
2,A little too mushy for me.,"Too perfect, too swampy, too Danielle Steele-ish for me. As a love story, it goes a long way in that genre. It is well written, the characters are lovable, the story is a good one. But you really need to be in the mood for a rather mindless, uncomplicated novel to enjoy this. I much prefer stories with a little depth. I was able to read this story in two days, there isn't much too it, and I found it pleasant yet boring in many places. If you like Harlequin, or Danielle Steele, you will enjoy this book. If you are looking for something to delve your mind into, perhaps you should look elsewhere."
3,"Not too bad, not too good....","This was my first experience with this author and I can't say I was highly delighted or disappointed with the experience...it was just another book. The romance was there and sweet at times, but the plot was a bit bland and the ending a disappointment. It's a quick read...it got me through two hours of biking at the gym....so that should tell you that it doesn't require a lot of deep thinking to comprehend!"
2,Don't bother,"I agree with the comment that the Canadian reader made, it did seem as if the author was in a hurry to complete this novel. She created characters that you could care about, too bad more thought wasn't put into their development. The ending was just awful.....I kept hoping that the hero would have somehow escaped his fate; that the terrorists gave the US the bad news to save face because in reality he managed to get away. Leaves alot of unanswered questions. What a waste of potential."
1,HATED IT.,"Rare example of the movie being better than the book that inspired it. I bought the book because I had recently seen the made-for-TV movie and liked it. Let's just say that I enjoyed the movie, but hated the book- the most important parts of story are completely different (including the ending) and the only similarities are the names of the characters and Venice!This was my first (and definitely last) Bradford novel."
2,TV movie was MUCH better!,"This book was Okay, but not as great and soooooooooooo Romantic and exciting as the TV movie version. It aired on CBS Oct. 27. I want to see it again!"
4,Romance With a Twist,"This was a book I couldn't stop reading. True, it's a romance story, but I think it's more than that. It's very poignant, and it has a bittersweet ending...all the good things that make for a great romance book."
1,Not worth buying,"I had expected a much better read from this author, since I had read the Woman of Substance saga. When I reached the end of the book I couldn't believe it was already the last page. It felt like an incomplete story with no plot. I would not recommend anyone to buy it."
3,Too short! Very disappointing!,I think the author was in a hurry to finish writing the book. Too short! Could have added more details to get to know the characters much better. Very sorrow ending. Overall = Not worth the money!
4,A pleasent book to read.,"This book is one the most outstanding books i've read in my 18 years of life. It was a very beautiful story. I still can't believe that one of the main character dies at the end. Venice,Italy one of the most romantic places to be and to meet your true love then it was New York my home another place were you can enjoy life.All i can say is that i enjoy Barbara Taylor Bradford's books and i hope people that read her novels will too i encourge you to buy and read just one novel and you will know what i am talking about.It was a captivating work filled with glamour,intigue and ironic reversal... Richly textured,highly entertaining and stunning love and romance story."
1,Disapointed,"I looked forward to watching this film as I like what George does. There seemed to be no specific plot. It starts with some sparse old footage of George and a brief explanation of him. At one point we see the driveway to his property!!! but no George? Were then told by various people in the surf industry what an influence George has been on their surfing, which is fine I understand what they mean, and then treated to some footage of a few pros surfing, which is OK, but still no George? There was a glimmer of hope towards the end as we then see George start to inflate a mat, at this point I honestly believed Id get to see George surf but alas no. Its cuts. No interview, dialogue or anything from the man himself. When I looked at the viewing time before watching I thought 35 minutes of this would fly by, it didnt. I get that the film was meant as a homage to GG, but I really think that it didnt do him justice at all."
4,Don't you believe?,"I didn't believe in fairies until my daughter came home from her trip to Avebury and we saw a picture taken by her friend showing a fairy dancing on my daughter's head, and one slightly off to the side standing on a leaf. My daughter was playing her flute in the lotus position in a sacred grove. I believe now! They really DO exist, but not always to the naked eye.This book just fueled my interest more and is well-written."
5,"its shinedown, enough said!",captures the high energy live performounce shinedown delivers everytime! a must have for the hardcore fan!
3,Not That Great,"This DVD is only for the die hard Shinedown fans. This DVD was good, but in my opinion, the lead singer, Brent Smith, isn't that much of a good live singer. That's just my opinion though. Alot of the times he is way off with the music and it just sounds completley messed up."
1,shinedown live from the inside,"Bad sound. Just was not what I thought it would be, and I like the band. Not happy with it."
3,Ok DVD worth it for the 2 music videos,I didnt really care for most the live show portion of the dvd except for when they performed simple man and 45. Really wish they would release another live dvd with more recent stuff and also a dvd of all there music videos. I dont care for the whole itunes crap. I bought this dvd mainly for the music videos on it and the interviews.
2,Sadly disappointed,"First off we are huge Shinedown fans. We've been lucky enough to see them live twice. We couldn't wait to get this DVD home. It was disappointing. The first time we saw them live the vocals were weak. This DVD reflects the same. We just recently saw them on their ""Us and Them"" tour. The performance far surpassed what we saw live and on the DVD. My recommendation is to wait until the next live DVD comes out. Shinedown has obviously learned a great deal on their first tour. I can't wait to see what the furture holds for them."
4,Das Beste.,"This is the standard ""herecomewordbook"" (etymological dictionary) for German. It's very useful and much fuller than the one by Duden. I recommend it for anyone learning German.For other standard works, see my review on Pokorny."
1,Bogus,"I should have known by the picture of the old men clustered around the band stuff, but was swayed by the 'release' date of Nov. 1968. That will teach me to be in a hurry. These are NOT the original recordings, with Dennis Tufano on the vocals. It would appear to be a collection with the current lineup, and Carl Giammarese on vocals. Close, no cigar. $5 down the drain for the mp3 files. Next time I won'd be in such a hurry to get to work."
4,A Page Turner If I Ever Read One,"I love action. I love plot twists. I love horror. This book combines it all--multiplied by about 150. I've got to hand to to the author. By infusing his experience as a US Navy SEAL and his interesting take on religion, he has created a work that makes both Stephen King and Tom Clancy look like unimaginative hacks (though I enjoy reading them both). This book not only stretches the imagination, but makes you wonder a little about the fate of humanity and all we stand for. Though a little confusing at times, all and all this is a fun and interesting read that is hard to put down. Like the previous reviewer, I can't wait to see what Mr. MacDonald thinks of next."
2,lacking in quality,"many students in my class newly perchased this book less than 5 months ago, and within 2 months of barly any use, many students were complaining that the book's bindings were falling apart! almost all of the class's books were falling apart. also, many of the chapters have hundreds of vocab words, but many of the vocab words are repeated and repeated! it is nice that the book gives both simplified and traditional characters, but the grammar examples and the homework exercises are only done in simplified...which is a real pain if you only know traditional."
2,Lacking and quality and repeated vocab,"I am a third year Chinese student, and have recently switched to this textbook. I was very disappointed with the quality of the book. Literally the first day that I opened it, right after I received it in the mail, there were multiple pages that fell out of the book. Moreover, there is the fact that many words are repeated through the chapters or are words that would have previously been learned in earlier levels of Chinese. It is frustrating as a student to go to the next chapter and see multiple words in the new chapter that we had already learned in the previous chapter."
4,A compact treasure,"The piano works of Johannes Brahms, here recorded, represent in brief the best of Brahms middle period. Here one finds a man who has reached the maturity of his years; his vision directed more towards the contemplative than the assertive. At last he finds rest."
3,Disappointed,Im using the book but a little disappointed with the material. This is no fault of the seller. The book was in great condition and arrived quick. Just a little dull reading.
1,Bratz lamp,"This lamp looked cute but was made of very light, cheap plastic. We had it a very short time when the top part of the lamp with the beads came apart from the rest of the lamp. The top part of the lamp also cracked. I was also afraid with the thin plastic that it could cause a fire. I would not purchase this item again. I saw cute lamps in Target that were much better quality."
5,"Wonderfully pleasing, supremely musical performance","First-rate choice...if you are looking for a 1st and maybe only trombone CD. The Ferdinand concerto which is considered the ""classical"" trombone concerto is played really well as compared to other recordings by Armin Rosin or Branimir Slokar. Look out for Lindberg's flexibility and virtuosity, matched by the orchestra's fine playing. Lindberg is indeed the best all-round trombone soloist around with his immaculate phrasing and horn-like tone. But on the downside, his tuning can be sometimes (though very rarely) off. But that should not take away any enjoyment u receive as u listen to that exotic instrument. SO...JUST GO AND LISTEN TO IT!!!"
5,Cool looking Bar,I put this one to my kawasaki z750 and it looks good and feels like a hundred times better. Great handlebar and I'll buy a new one for my next bike.
5,the best foundation ever,"I have fair to medium skin with a yellow undertone. This foundation gave me the perfect coverage, and it's oil free so it doesn't cause any acne or milia. I will definitely repurchase."
3,Revolver pistol safety,"If you have just purchased a revolver style of pistol, this is the book for you to learn all about its operation and safety. However, if you would like to learn all about your new semi-automatic pistol, this book does not discuss semi-automatic pistols..."
2,NOT even a good copy!,"I only gave this a 2 because of the content (which is MORE than a 5), but had I known this was THIS bad, I would have copied my EXcellent VHS to DVD! BAD excuse for a copy!"
5,awesome,"for me it fits everything,has room for everything it has room for two controller chargers,4 wireless controllers (i only have 3 wireless controllers),the power brik,tv cables,12 games,and my headset (it can also fit a wireless headset),and i fogot to say has room for the xbox 360,if i forgot something it's because im tired of typing"
2,Too difficult - source of a frustrating day,"I used this book prior to taking the PE exam, as a practice test - blocked out the whole day, stuck to the schedule, etc. In general, I found the problems to be very complicated and involved (NOT six minute problems), and the test was just too difficult. I was not able to complete this test in eight hours. When I took the actual PE exam a short time later, it was much simpler, and I finished both sessions with time to spare.I will say this - if you can take the exam in this book in 8 hours, and get over half of the questions right, then you should have no problem on the real thing.For a set of practice questions that more closely resembles the actual exam, I recommend the NCEES published book. Those questions have a comparable level of difficulty and take about the right amount of time to solve."
3,Needs polishing,There are many errors in this book. Some of the problems require some obscure methods in order to solve them. I doubt the PE Exam is as hard as some of the problems in this book. The online NCEES sample exam seemed more realistic in regards to the material tested. I wouldn't recommend this text except that there aren't really any better alternatives so I would say it is better practice than nothing.
3,Broke Binding after one use,"As far as reference material the book is excellent. However, I used the book last night for the first time and the first 40 pages were already coming apart from the book's binding. I want a new one!!!!"
1,Incomplete first show show!,"INCOMPLETE SHOW! The Frankenstein sequence has been edited out! A whole 10 minutes of the first show is missing! The old VHS tape is complete.The second show is complete and fun to watchThe audio also sounds distorted when played directly through my TV speakers. However, when I play this through my stereo system it sounds fine, you just have to keep the volume turned down to compensate for the high volume level recorded."
5,Who Is on first ? ! THis is one of the funniest routines ever. A must have for any Drama teacher out there or Fan.,"I bought many different Abbot and Costello videos trying to aquire"" Who is on First? "" This is the one. There are other funny routines on this DVD like: Two Tens for a Five. There are acrobats on this show as well that are amazing. It is a must have for all the tresure and laughs you will find on this DVD. A must have for any Drama teacher or any teacher who wants to give the class a good laugh. YOu NEVER get tired of it. It is an American classic. And I found it at last!"
5,Cute and Romantic - Definite Chick Flick,"This was a cute movie. If you're looking for something deep and meaningful, this is not it. If you're looking for something lighthearted and entertaining, then it's definitely worth watching. I have several gay friends, so certainly enjoyed the humor in the movie. I've even had a crush on a gay friend and would have loved to have him tell me he wasn't really gay! In a way, this was kinda like watching my own fantasy play out! This was such an enjoyable movie that I'm definitely adding it to my collection."
3,Held my interest,"Every so often I find a movie that absolutely holds my interest, even though it isn't a 5 star movie with lots of hype. This was one of those appealing movies. As for Allison Eastwood, I didn't realize who her father was. I thought she was quite good, and the love interest who pretended to be gay was darling. I laughed out loud several times. Only seeing the twin towers in the background of this New York-based movie was tugging on my heartstrings."
3,Why not?,"Hey look, It's pretty good for what it is. A nice romantic story .It works if you don't pick out every little detail.If you do, don't get it.I liked the soundtrack."
2,Oldie but no Goldie,"You really have to be an avid fan to like this DVD, Yes there is some funny routines but the commercials and the singing don;t really cut it for me.I remember seeing the baseball stint when I was young and still get a laugh out of it today."
3,amazing,"amazing to see what 1950's television really was like!! the quality of the dvd is not up to todays standards, but it is still watchable. and it was quite the trip not quite down memory lane."
1,I JUST LIKE THE MUSIC,if SOMEBODY KNOWS the SOUNDTRACK LIST could send it on o_bad.red@virgilio.it ????????
2,If You Only Knew,The only thing that saves this film is the music and performance of the artist LOURDS. She should have been in it more and she definatly deserves a better film that this one. I give LOURDS the 5 stars!!!
3,A good tool for the weekend warrior,"This tool is well made and can be used best in a drill press for cutting veneer or I have used it for cutting mortises and dowel holes when I am looking to avoid chip out. The savings over the carbides is nice but be aware that they will require sharpening more often, thus it is a good compromise for the occasional user."
1,"Dull, Dull, Dull",Don't buy these unless you have a good asssortment of slipstones and a lot of time. I couldn't believe how dull they were out of the box. I'm still trying to get a sharp edge on them after 2 hours! Milling grooves are especially bad. Don't buy these unless you can look at them before buying! Turned me off on anything made by Freud.
2,"Hardly ""The World's Greatest""","For a book entitled The World's Greatest Put-down Lines, one would expect the best of the best put-downs and nothing but put-downs, right?Well, only 31 pages are devoted to the supposedly ""greatest"" put-down lines while the remainder is comprised of cheesy put-downs and jokes for comedians and public speakers that are just down right weak and about as funny as watching the evening news.Examples:Excuse me, was I talking while you were?Is that your face or did your neck throw up?Now I know why some animals eat their young!See my point...and sadly those are some of the better ones. For a book written by comedians, I would think they would be able to come up with better put-downs than they have. While there are a few funny put-downs, these are anything but the ""greatest"" put-downs by any stretch of the imagination."
4,Pcture Brde Review,"Having grown up in Berkeley and nearby Oakland, I found this story fascnatng both as part of local history and as insght to the Japanese experience in California post WWI all the way up to WWI. Its a warm and touching story, filled with completely believable character studies. Well worth reading on many levels."
4,Picture Bride,"""Picture Bride"" is an unforgotten novel. This was a novel that I loved. The story was about a Japanese woman, Hana who came to the United States to married a man she had never met before. The story was happened from 1918 to 1943. The author, Uchda san, successfully combined the story with a very strong history background. He allowed the readers be able to ""learn"" the real life of Japanese-American particularly before and during the WWII. At the same time, he unveiled the ""conflicts"" between the second generations and with their immigrated parents in the United States. However, there is one thing I would like to point out. In the book, the author sometimes utilized the Japanese romanization style instead the English translation. For instance, he used ""Oji san"" instead of ""uncle."" If the reader has no knowledge of Japanese, I am afraid that they will lose their interests as the story was continuing."
4,A cultural book which reveals universal themes,"Yoshiko Uchida's The Picture Bride is a compelling story of Hana, a Japanese women who immigrates to America. Uchida entwines Japanese culture with universal themes of marriage, family, love, bigotry, pride, and determination throughout the story. The novel is a wonderful piece of literature that reveals horrible truths of American history which evokes the human conscience and soul. I highly recommend this book, especially to anyone who wants to know more about Japanese-American culture."
5,"A haunting, quietly heartwrenching story","""Picture Bride"" is an unforgettable novel. In her deceptively simple style, Yoshiko Uchida draws the reader into the Japanese-American world and brings it to life. Unlike the cold, factual feel of a textbook, Uchida uses a character (Hana Omiya) who is easily identified with to portray early 20th century America as seen and felt from the Japanese perspective. Hana is a woman with a strong spirit who seems to have been born in the wrong world, and you find yourself both pitying her circumstances and admiring her strength, which lasts to the end. This was a novel I thoroughly loved."
1,Overpriced and small.,"Half of this book is about basics of the Excel program. Very little is about real estimating and working out profit and loss. If you were to use the markups described in this book, you would lose money. A better title for this book would be "" Introductry estimating with Excel""..."
1,Save your money for something better,"This is a book only 138 pages. From the beginning to end, all he does was to show off his Excel tricks. Virtually nothing for construction or estimating. If you want to know how to do this or that in Excel, why not ""google"" up some tips? (Online tips are always free)I purchased it, finished the book within a few hours, and came out with nothing. It came with a CD, but the purpose was to promote the author's estimating software, which is based on Excel but asking for $500. This is not cool...This book is not worth $35 I paid for. I heard from a friend that DeWalt Estimating series is adding a new book on spreadsheet estimating. I like their books better. Would look forward to new book and compare. But I really doubt any other book will be worse than this one..."
3,Ok Book,Good info. Just wasn't what I was looking for exactly in an estimating book. Lots of information for home builders
1,The CD Is Garbage,"I wanted a CD that actually shows examples of the work in the book. Not a gimmick to buy a program. The CD examples do not work as shown, if I want to purchase an estimating program I would haveEvery time I open Excel it counts as a time being used for Estimator Pro, regardless if I wanting to work in the book or not. I use Excel for several things so since I had the Book and CD(less than 24 hours) now I have no times left to review the examples. Worthless is giving the CD Credit; the jury is still out on the book."
4,Estimating with Microsoft Excel: Unlocking the Power for Home Builders,"I need help in the CD program which I purchased recently. Message appear like this: Digitally signed trusted certificate is not assigned to the macros; required certificate is not within its validity period. I checked the Tools, security, details sectrion and it reads that the product validity is 9/13/2002 to 10/2/2003. I need your help on this matter. The book is alright, all the info I need is there. But how about the program which I need in my job? Please help me."
4,don't put in dishwasher,"Works as advertised, but too big for a 9.5 inch pan. don't put in dishwasher, as it is aluminum, and will tarnish, badly."
5,Highly recommended for Beatles fans,"This is an especially poignant interview with John Lennon. Very candid, mature John, not the usual flippant person seen on the Mike Douglas or Dick Cavett series. Tom Snyder provides an intelligent interview, John offers thoughtful and very insightful conversation. My opinion is the absence of Yoko is the difference here. McCartney and Starr are a waste of time but I guess there is some historical significance to their inclusion. Without a doubt, the highlight is the Lennon interview."
1,bad recommendation,Can't stand it- don't want it. PLEASE remove from my recommendation list!!The Tomorrow Show With Tom Snyder
3,Nothing About Everything or Everything About Nothing?,"Take a look at the online version available at http://catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ and think twice before buying this book. Unless you are a complete newcomer to Unix programming, TAOUP will be useless. The first part, ""Design"" covers the culture of Unix, and may be useful, but the rest of the text lacks the necessary depth. Real Unix programming books, like Stevens' one are much better."
4,"Good Book, Good Principles","Eric S. Raymond is a controversial open source developer and evangelist.The true is that he has a good points and ideias of how to develop using the unix pratices (eg. the practice of separation and program specialization).I love unix (any flavor), it is by far the best operating system for a wise developers. The advice of Eric really makes sense for someone used to work with unix, and I put a lot of his advice to good use.I recommend this book to an intermediate/advance unix programmer/analyst."
3,an interesting and often annoying read...,"I suppose any book containing so many interesting quotes from so many UNIX luminaries cannot be overlooked. (I wonder if any of them would have co-authored this) It also happens to contain a great many topics that are well-worth writing about; My only wish is that someone less in awe with the contents of his own field of vision, and with greater depth and objectivity (not to mention humility) had the opportunity to write this book.Quality of discussion is varied as expected; Raymond is not quite the UNIX expert he thinks he is. In places, Raymond's tone encourages one to throw the book at the nearest wall and go out just to get some fresh air; He is condescending, hectoring, lecturing, and sometimes just misleading. Alas, I will still recommend it as worth reading (check your local library) with a nice grain of salt; just enough friction for thought is provided in this edition."
2,a rip-off!!!,"Whoever was in charge of this travesty should be shot. The majority of the ""songs"" are just 2-3 minute ""clips"". And two of the Cal Jam clips, Lucky Man and Karn Evil, are shown twice...I mean, does that make any sense??!!Buyer beware....just be aware that very few of the songs are actually full length!!"
4,Fairly Good,"I was hoping for better, though this is quite a good DVD set. Most of the problems have been discussed earlier, such as out of sync sound quality, sometimes poor visual quality, edited performances etc.During the video for ""Tiger In The Spotlight"" the band plays RIGHT NEXT TO A TIGER. Sure, the tiger was probably quite harmless and tame, but that's really not a good idea. By the end of the video it's basically laying on Greg's foot. I'd have definitely not liked to have been in his place."
4,welcome back,nice compilation of an underdocumented bandI never got to see any of the erly concerts so this was a real treat for me
3,Nice....but also disappointing,"..... and severely lacking quality!Nice collection of clips, but why on earth CUT THEM SHORT ???Quality of the video also varies quite a bit. Some even seem like taken from a 2nd generation video (e.g. the clip from Japan).Despite what the cover sais, it's NOT a 5.1 sound mix, but plain stereo.Tracklisting on the back is wrong, fortunately the booklet has the correct listing.Booklet is nice, but not very informative and some liner notes are plain silly.On paper this looks like a great DVD set, but in reality, it's lacking quality on all fronts. The producers certainly didn't put any effort into releasing a high quality product."
3,"Anyone else is bummed with the ""pauses"" between the songs on the Cal Jam footage?","To me, it's annoying as hell. And my player handles layer changes pretty well."
4,Pomp and Glory,"This a very good value double disc set (running time 250 mins).OK a lot of the concert films are not up to modern standards, however as a historical document this will take some beating. It also demonstrates the fabulous musicianship of these 3 guys. The highlight for me is Keith Emerson's appearance on the Oscar Peterson show performing Honky Tonk Train Blues. But the (full length) promo film for Fanfare for the Common Man is also very good. There is quite an interesting documentary as well, and the 1974 California Jam session is on disc 2."
3,For the true/hardcore/faithful fan only......,"The mini documentary is awsome! The rehearsal footage is even more impressive-no ProTools, just real musicians actually playing, not programming their instruments. The bad, as with most older bands, is the poor editing as well as the deteriorating video quality makes for some tough viewing. For 25.00, its well worth it. If this is supposed to be the be-all/end-all final ELP video, were in trouble...."
1,"Emerson,Out of Sync & Palmer","Recently I had purchased ELP ""Masters from the Vaults"" and I was disapointed because of the major out of sync pieces.So finally I was hoping in bying this DVD it will a nice purchase,A CLASSIC !! What a shame.Another time, a lot of pieces are out of sync and of course my favorites one like Tarkus,Lucky Man,Still you turn me on,etc etc...I cannot beleive there is no quality control before releasing a DVD of a great band like this."
4,An honest look at ELP's rise and fall,"As a video collector I already own much of what's here, though it's nice to have some of it on DVD. Serious fans will want to track down the complete Belgian '71 program, for instance, though there's enough rare material offered to keep even serious fans' attention throughout. What surprised me, however, was the honesty with which the band members discuss the less than positive aspects of their history and their relationships with one another. Overall this set offers a nice balance of archival live footage plus a comprehensive biographical overview told from both the band's point of view as well as by those close to them at the time."
1,Not Happy!,"Unfortunately I am NOT happy with this seller and neither this product because it looks so good and nice on the internet but after I used it first time started being rusty and I try to contact the seller to ask him about it and I did not get anything back neither a way of replacement or to receive another one but is not recommended to use a product which started being rust, I am sorry that I have to write this down on my review but I wait already more than 2 weeks to get an answer back and nothing happened. Is a good product when you look at but unfortunately I bought it to be useful and it's a shame that shows on a product Germany Stainless Steel but as far as I know there is no German Stainless Steel to get rust. Sorry"
4,Travel to the Holy Land!,"I liked a lot this book, but I wasn't crazy about it. It was too sweet to believe sometimes. I loved it for the history of Israel that was brought up, and it was interesting to read about excavation sites.The writer used flashbacks in this book which is very common in her books. I like the book but would not call it Lynn's best. But I would recommend this book to anyone."
4,Not a happily ever after kind of book,"I really enjoyed the many layers to this book. While there was romance in the different stories that are intertwined within the book - romance is not it's focus. Forgiveness and following the Messiah through the broken times is at the heart - both in 60 A.D. and in modern times. Wings of Refuge was not about people falling in love and living happily ever after. The story involved very sad and tragic events that the characters had to make hard choices as to what their response would be.I have read the book several times and would recommend it for anyone who has grown tired of ""fluffy"" lightweight Christian fiction. There are plenty of surprising twists and turns along with a mystery or two. Enjoy!"
4,movie,I love this movie! I try to watch it as much as I can. I love watching Jessica Capshaw and hope to get more of her movies
4,I'm reminded of Mel Brooks,"It might be George Wyner, but this movie had a very Brooks style sense of humor.It's not for everyone, but if you like dark comedy and Neil Patrick Harris, you will really like this movie."
2,THE MESMERIST DVD REVIEW,"This movie kind off caught me off guard. It wasn't terrible but in some ways predictable. Take for instance the end which related to the Skeleton Key (2005). I would only advise watching this if someone is really board and has nothing to do. Overall, this thriller comedy was better than I expected and I had some laughs which is more than I can say for the other straight-to-DVD thriller comedies like Dead & Breakfast."
1,Caution: Not Funny,"This is extreme nastiness masquerading as comedy.I like gothic horror quite a bitand this film could have worked well as such.The plot has an excellent pedigree as it wasconceived by Edgar Allen Poe.Presented as a comedy, it totally fails.Is there something funny about slow and painful death,spousal abuse, suicide, lust, incest and the endurenceof an evil spirit.It is saturated with toilet humor from whicha pre-teen might obtain some guilty pleasure.The comical character of the mesmerist was well done.A wasted performance.If you laughed during this movie,you might consider seeking out spiritual direction.If you laughed at the ending and end credits song,you might consider turning yourself into the civil authorities as a public service.This might have made a great horror film.As a comedy, it is vile trash and to be avoided."
5,The best natural supplement!,"Taking cellfood has been the first thing in the morning to me for 3 years. It helps me feel energetic physically and clear mentally. On top of these benefits, cellfood prevents me from getting a cold in flu seasons while many people are sick around me in workplace. Now, I try every way to share such great results about cellfood to the people I know. Hope you are the one of them and be willing to give it a try."
5,Cellfood Liguid,This is a product I will continue to purchase for the rest of my life.Oxygen in our blood stream is necessary to keep from clotting and clogging in the flow of our blood. I can tell the difference when I routinly take my drops in my water vs....skipping the 3 z's a day.I can feel my brain and body working much better when I'm devoted to using it in my drinking water every day. Definetly will buy this again.
5,It works!,I've been using this product for about 3 years now. As with many supplements you might not feel a difference when you start taking it - I certainly didn't. What I did do though after a few months was a negative test where I quit using it. Then I really noticed a crash in my energy level. After starting to use it again I felt fine. I've done the negative test three times now with the same result each time. It works for me regarding my energy level and I highly recommend it.
5,Cell Food met my expectations!,"I have been using Cell Food about a month now and it has been giving me extra energy I always wanted. It also helps me go to bed easily and let me stay asleep. My husband is also using Cell Food and he is replacing his energy drinks (Monster or Red Bull) with Cell Food. All in all, we like this product very much and recommend it to anyone who is considering. Two thumbs up!"
3,On the fence..,"I've been using this for a while now and I'm not sure that anything has changed. There is nothing of real note to write about so I won't bother. If anything changes, I'll update."
2,CellFood,I didn't like this product at all. I bought it a couple years ago and took it for a couple weeks. I didn't see any benefits from taking it. I found the bottle today and will throw it out.
3,Didn't notice much.,"I've always been a runner and and saw an ad for this product and it got me curios. After a few days with it, I've yet to notice a difference, but then again can you even notice one?"
2,Honesty met with dishonesty,"I just wrote a review thinking this foum for testimonial witness of products was pretty objective. However, since my last lengthy post for cell food (which BTW I gave 4 stars)was not ""approved for review"". I just changed my mind about product and rate it as a 2 since it seemingly only wants information about product in what I feel is an effort to sell more of it."
1,To much hype! DO YOUR RESEARCH FIRST!!!,"Anything that gets to much hype is suspect to me ..which means it deserves a good long research, not just reading reviews from desperate ppl. Come to find out, this is no different then the bottle of miraculous cure another quack would ride into town & sell back in the 1800s. The Golden Minerals ..woooo!!! Don't be that sucker, ppls. Seriously tho ..this has serious side effects after taken for a long period of time, all. If you want energy, try juicing and yoga, or eat healthy.Read the long, long history on this, Try this for starters: Colloidal Mineral Supplements: Unnecessary and Potentially Hazardous(...)"
3,No difference for me,"I guess it's okay since was no harm from it. but i didn't see any result from using the product for 3 month (bought 3 bottles). My coworkers used it and praise it. I decided to give it a try. It's easy, tasteless. Probably the key is to beleive."
3,Didn't make a difference,I know people rave over this product. But for me this product really didn't make a difference one way or another. If I had to take a guess at it I would say that it simply didn't work at all. If it did then it wasn't enough to notice. Three stars.
5,Hashimoto's Cure Discovered!!!,"This is amazing!! I suffer from an auto-immune illness and it's seriously affected the quality of my life for years now. I've become groggy-headed and slow to wake each morning with never enough energy to make it through my day. I'd feel sick all the time, which is due to the high level of antibodies. I read about cellfood in a waiting room magazine and researched it online. I've tried hundreds of supplements, lifestyle and dietary changes aimed at helping my Hashimoto's. Nothing worked. This time I was just looking for a broad health supplement that the whole family could take. For once, I got more than I bargained for...way more!!! After the first dose, my brain felt awake and alert in a way it hasn't in years and that I never expected to feel again! I feel alive!! I'm no longer just drudging through and hanging on to get through the day. I'm excited to live my life again! Thank you, cellfood for bringing me back to life!"
5,Super energy,This is the best stuff. I have used this for over a year and it gives me more breath to life. I have more energy and can breath much better;new lease on life.
1,Not Effective,"I was told by my friend that this helped her Mother feel better, but when I tried it for 6 weeks, it did nothing for me. I was disappointed."
5,Good,"One of my friend asked me to help him buy this product. I don't use it, but he told me that it works pretty well."
4,Results will vary,"Depending on a lot of other factors like the rest of your diet, weight/BMI, organic weaknesses, and overall health, this stuff can have anything from a negligible effect to a distinct one. Hopefully you thought as much.I'm in pretty good shape overall, and eat mildly and prudently. I notice it, but it's not overwhelming. I will say that I seem to be more prone to migraines after 12+ drops in 36 hours. Lucky for me my migraines aren't too bad.Prudence dictates starting with mild usage and increasing dosages gradually, maintining a level for several days to observe effects before proceeding further."
5,A Good Way To Get Your Amino Acids,"What a good way to get your minerals and amino acids, which is very important to maintaining a youthful and healthy life! It's also very economical, dosage is I believe 8 drops added to a glass of water so that 1 ounce bottle will last you a very long time."
1,Was a waste of money for us,"We bought 3 bottles and used them as directed. No results, no nothing. I am sure the product works for some folks, but not for us."
3,Not a Clue,"If it works or not. Not sure what to look for or if it is even worth the while, but I thought it would be a decent replacement for fulvic minerals. I'm going to say the jury is still out on this one, haven't felt any specific benefits from this product, unless I'm not aware. If you take this for a specific reason, make sure you understand the mechanics behind it and know what to expect and how to measure your benefits."
5,Great product,It is difficult to come right out and make a claim as to just what this product will do for your body. BUT. I've been taking it once a day now for several months and all I can honestly say is my body seems to be functioning better with less lower back pain than before. I plan on continuing to take this product from now on. I do believe it is helping. I would suggest you get the booklet and read up on it like I did.
1,False Claims Regarding Everett Storey,Did some research and Everett Storey was NOT one of the scientists involved with the Manhattan Project AND was never awarded the Nobel Prize. I am suspicious of any product where lies must be told in order to sell it...just saying.
4,detox regularly - stay healthy,"I took cellfood as a part of my 4-weeks detox plan. I wouldn't know what to expect from this liquid concentrate on its own because it worked for me as a total body detox / lifestyle change. All I have to admit is that somehow, if you stick to the routine, and invest yourself not only morally but financially you'd have no other options but succeed. I recommendThe 4-Week Ultimate Body Detox Plan: A Program for Greater Energy, Health, and Vitalityalong with cellfood. It changed my outlook onto the products I use - internally and externally (such as cosmetics, household cleaners etc.)"
4,First time user,"This was my initial order of Cell Food which was recommended to me by a friend. I find that it is easy to use and fairly economical given the it's in concentrated form. I like the taste which is a very mild dry mineral taste. I find that in using this product I am drinking more water and my body seems to enjoy it. I am not taking it on any set schedule and yet I find I usually will have some each day, if not multiple times a day. I have no data to show that it has specifically improved my health, but for the reasons given earlier I would recommend it."
4,My Review,"I found this CD on Amazon after attending the funeral of a friends son where the church choir sang one of the songs on this CD. I enjoy listening to the music on the CD and use the music at our church as well. I would have rated it with 5 stars, because the performances deserve it, however, in some places the sound seems to be distorted, as though the recording tape overloaded at some points. That quibble aside, I recommend this CD."
2,Could Have Been Much Better,"Charlotte Bronte is definitely a very fascinating person, but I found that this book focuses too much on her writings and not on her life. The author inserts Charlotte's writings too frequently. The book doesn't flow, it is too choppy. It is hard to understand because one minute you're reading about Charlotte and then the next minute you are reading something that she wrote and there isn't a smooth transition between the two. The author interprets all of Charlotte's writings as though everything she wrote was based on her life experience and Charlotte wasn't creative enough to come up with her own plots and characters apart from her own experiences. It's too subjective. I didn't enjoy it and found it hard to get through."
1,Catherine Coulter's worst book!!,"I'm a big fan of Catherine Coulter, but this is the most gawd-awful book she has put out. It's a good thing this wasn't the first book I'd read by her or else I'd never touch another of her books. For starters, minus the fact that Chelsea has black hair, her life parallels that of the author and the book read like an autobiography. Chelsea is from California, she's a romance writer (Catherine even has Chelsea writing stories from her Star and Song series), she likes to workout, and David is a physician (like Catherine's husband), the list goes on and on... In truth, this book was just plain blah and very cookie-cutter. Catherine has put out some great stuff, but this just wasn't one of them."
3,"A good read, but could have been better","I enjoyed the plot of the book, but Chelsea was an irritating heroine is this novel. Some may call her free-spirited , but I don't think this was the case at all. David was not Ms. C typical hero, but I felt more of a connection and sympathy with him then Chelsea. If I was him, I would have left Chelsea a long time ago. Besides the flawed heroine and sensitive hero, I enjoyed the book. Revisiting the lives of George and Elliot made the book more enjoyable."
1,COMPLETELY WORTHLESS,"This product is so defective it should be recalled. I can only display a maximum of 161 pictures, even if you have a 4GB SD card with over 1000 pictures, it will only display the first 161 pictures. Even though it has a USB port for USB flash drives, the interface does not even give you the option to read from a USB flash drive. There is also no ""shuffle"" function for the slide show feature.I spoke with White Westinghouse Tech Support, and they acknowledged that all the above things were known issues, but there was nothing they could do to fix them. I explained that no where does it mention that there is a maximum limit of 161 pictures!"
1,No edited photos,Westinghouse customer support told me the frame will NOT support images which have been resized or manipulated (i.e. Photoshopped).The frame is designed to only work with a card which has been directly moved from a camera.Big disappoinment.
4,Very Pleased.,"I'm very pleased with the image quality of this frame. I previously bought a 7"" frame from EDGE and it was complete garbage. I have no idea what everyone means when they say it won't display manipulated pictures. I've loaded over 60 pictures, all of which were resized and touched up with photoshop and they all displayed fine. My only gripe is the stand on the back is kind of flimsy, and I could definitely see the frame falling over if you were to bump the table it was sitting on."
1,Product is terrible,"As another reviewer alluded to the picture colors are muted. No vibrant colors and skin tones washed out.As other sites have reviewed, this product has many problems with its USB port, which is evidently often either broken or simply does not work. Mine came out of the box with a partially functioning but completely unusable USB2.0 port. Too much to ask for a product to implement a standard port like that?Bottom line, there is lots of demand for these in 2006 XMAS season.... wait and buy another product line if this is all you can find."
1,Product Dies after short warranty runs out,My Westinghouse DPF-0801 Photoframe died after 9 months. When I contacted Westinghouse they told me it only had a 6 month warranty. So I asked them how much it would cost to fix it. Guess what? They do not have out-of-warranty service for this item! A digital product like this should last years instead of months. Westinghouse refuses to stand behind their own poorly made product and my six children who bought this product for me for Christmas are out over a hundred bucks! DO NOT BUY ANY WESTINGHOUSE PRODUCTS!!!!!
2,Clear Picture ... when it works,"I received this as a gift for Christmas. The pictures do look great when they are loaded into flash memory. However, I've had several issues when trying to use this product:(1) Windows XP had a difficult time recognizing this device when I plugged it in. I had to unplug the USB and replug it back it which finally worked (with some help from my husband).(2) The user manual stinks. It provides very little detail on how to use the product or the features. It was of no help at all.(3) Once the pictures were loaded and unplugged from USB for viewing I couldn't get back to the main menu to switch from picture to video file viewing. I tried reloading the images a few times and no luck. It just comes up with a black speckly screen and then freezes.I would not recommend this product. It is a great idea, but I would try another brand. Mine is going back to the store."
1,Test your DPF-0801 before leaving the store!,"My DPF-0801 is marginally useful, but from all the negative comments out there already along with the positive ones, I'm hopeful that I just have a lemon and can get it replaced quickly. My major complaints:1. The Westinghouse web page has zero help for my problems and zero help for all the others that are being documented. This is irresponsible.2. My unit cannot connect with USB 1.0 or 2.0 devicesat all.3. The vitally important ""menu"" button often has no results when pressed.4. The other buttons often create no or random results when pressed. Occasionally I get lucky and things work.5. The slide show starts by whim and is restricted to a 20-30 sec delay between pictures. The adjustment sequence in the menu fails totally.3. It reads a SONY memory chip OK, but can process the images only after many random menu presses and on/off trials.As I said, I hope there are good replacement units out there. A few people seem to be reporting good results."
5,Important Contribution,"If you are already an experienced player, yet you don't have the benefit of working with a veteran player to learn all the ""inside"" tricks, this book will help you on your quest. Pocket billiards in general consists of only a few standard shots, but in serious play you need to be able to pull tricks out of your hat to win. This book will teach you both the common shots and the more esoteric combo, carom, kiss, hook, ghost, and masse shots. Work on your stroke, your patterns, your mental toughness, and Ray Martin's compendium of 99 Critical Shots and you'll be a winner!"
5,excellent text; wish the publisher could have done better,"Ray writes in a very straight forward , informative, witty and challenging style. The diagrams and explanations are clear and easy to understand. I am , however, disappointed that I cannot distinguish between the two groups of balls ( grays and blacks).....the copying or reproduction process could have been better (what happened to quality inspection) . P.S . I purchased the paperback edition."
4,Lots and lots of info,This book is amazing. It contains so much information. I have been playing pool for 5 years and I discovered so many shots I did not know before and learned to improve the shots that I thought I did know.It is a great book if you want to lock yourself away for 12 months to study or even if you just want to improve your existing game.The information presented is easy to follow and the accompanying pictures are terrific. It's just a matter of knuckling down and practising.
2,Poorly implemented illustrations,"While this book does deliver exactly what it promises in the way of content, there is a significant flaw in the illustrations, which are essential for a book of this type. The introduction explains that the object ball will be black and other balls will be grey. Unfortunately the reproduction of the grey balls is basically black.Under bright lighting and close examination you can see a slight difference, but it's much harder than it should be. Perhaps only this particular edition or run has this problem, but it significantly detracts from the readability. On the more complex shots it takes careful deduction to associate what you are reading to the illustration."
3,Could be better,"I would have rated this book higher but it did not have enough about strategy in my opinion. There was no mention of Mitchel, Krosnokv, or Tihinski but other than that it was not bad. Other books approach the problem inductively: they show you the most important/useful shots and tell you how to approach them. There are several pool books out there. Some attempt to explain pool deductively: they explain general rules about how balls go and expect you to be able to apply them in any given situation."
5,This book is a billiards bible!!!!,"I never played pool before, until about 7 years ago, when I met my husband, who had been playing all his life. Out of self defense, I began to learn the game by watching the ""bar room masters"". After reading Ray's book, I can proudly say that the student has surpassed the teacher! I beat my hubby 5 out of 7 games the other night at the pool hall, then ran the bar table for almost 5 hours. Ray teaches pool as a strategic thinking man's game, then tests what you've learned at the end of the book."
5,I still remember those shots after all these years.........,"It was the year 1997 that I bought this book in Manila. Since then I'm constantly reading this book while I was playing back home in the Philippines. This book helps me a lot on improving my shot making techniques. I still remember how I made those shots on every game I played with my friends and with other money players I ecountered on every busy billiards halls.I'm now in Sydney Australia and it's been more than 3 years that I don't actively play my favorite sport of all. Occasionally, I played light games on Sydney pubs and I can still see those shots that I learned from this book.I miss those pool halls in Manila and also this one together with other books which I left on my parents' place and I hope my Dad is not reading ""my precious"" book... ;)"
2,Meaningfully outdated...,"This nearly 40 year old book has some useful information in it but much of the info is significantly dated. Also, when they reissued the book, they made no attempt to edit the many references in the verbiage to images on the pages. Lots of the verbiage refers to images that are not where they are mentioned. Plenty of other good pool books around. I'd save your money on this one!"
3,playing pool,"gift for husband...didn't used it much, but he said it was very informative and helpful with learning about making angled and trick shots"
5,THIS IS IT,This is an essential read for anyone who is serious about the game.It helps you become proficient at shots that come up thousands of times in play.
3,"Good, but here's something Better...","I got this book as a rookie. I started practicing about 5 days a week and thought I should get a book. This was a good book for practicing a few shots. And the things that the author explained were true, but if you really want to improve your game, you should seriously consider ""Byrne's New Standard Book of POOL and BILLIARDS"". Now that's a book that deserves the title of ""everything you need to know to learn and master the game""! A guy at the local pool hall recommended it to me. I ended up buying both books. I don't even use the 99 Critical Shots book anymore. I mean, it's still a good book, and if I had a table in the basement and just wanted to practice a few shots on some Saturday afternoon, I would totally refer to this book. Otherwise, Byrne's book has been my guide and has helped improve my game far more than these 99 Critical Shots."
4,Definitely improved my game,I just started with the game and was looking for a book that can be used as reference. I didn't even realize that there are a lot of books on the game. 99 Critical Shots definitely gave me the confidence to make those shots. It really makes my day when I see a situation that is discussed in the book and have a go at it. I usually go over the book from time to time and check what I missed or what I did wrong and look forward to correcting the shot the next time around.Can't explain the feeling when you see the cue ball going to where you planned it to be.Thanks Ray......
4,Bought a copy for my nephew,"I have had a copy of this for a number of years and find myself referring back to it often. Excellent info for both novice and experienced players. Bought a copy for my 15 year old nephew who is just now learning to shoot. Each of the shots diagramed come up frequently in play so knowing what to do and how to do it is valuable info. My only complaint is the diagrams aren't nearly as clear as, say, one of Robert Bryne's books. Otherwise, highly recommended."
2,Technical guide.,"Not sure if this a good book for beginners. Why: the directions are VERY technical, I have a 3.75 gpa out of 4.0 and it seemed hard to me! The pictires are black and white and I cant distinguish which ball they are talking about half the time! Its useable, but you have to take your time. Lots of time and patience b"
4,you can see the difference in your shot,"It really opened my eyes to possibilities I'd never seen before. Some of the examples in the book seem impossible to control, but if you follow the directions, you'll be surprised how they work. As for the illustrations, yes stripes would have been a better choice than gray, but I never had trouble knowing which ball was the object ball. If you look close, you can see the differences, but even without that, the context and markings always made it clear. My game is improving and I've only had the book for a short time."
3,Useful information,"Very interesting information about natural systems.The book was easy to understand, well structured, and did answer to my expectations. A very inspiring lecture."
1,Extremely Displeased,I guess I had to put at least on star on it. The device is probably very good but does not come with a driver. I was unable to find a driver for it on the net.
1,No drivers for Windows 7 64-bit,"I did see the other review stating this point, but I thought I'd give it a shot anyway, with no success. Not sure how Intel can't provide a driver for Win 7 for this product. Fail Intel."
3,There are better titles,"I was a tad disappointed - this is well played music, but not something that takes you to another place... There are several songs that are trite and so well known they make your mind want to sing along - rather than travel to another place in your mind and meditate or really relax."
4,Healing from the Harp,The music in this CD is very soothing and peaceful. The arrangements created for these well-known songs are stunning. Great for dinner music and/or meditation.
3,Simple tunes warrant a different title,"The title of this CD is quite misleading. The collection of simple tunes played by Ms. Fletcher is not by far as interesting as ""Healing..."" implies. For some people this music may very well be a source of relaxation, I find it a far cry from what reviews and synposis suggest."
1,What a Crock!,"I bought this, thinking it was an additional volume of episodes of the one I bought that was released in 2008. In fact, it's the same episodes, with 2 missing from the earlier edition.Obviously, I wouldn't have bought this if I had known it was the same thing. Also, the title has been altered slightly. The first one I bought mentions the years 1962-1957. This new volume says 1961-1967, so naturally I thought new episodes were being released. So, as I said, What a Crock to the eggheads who released this in a misleading manner. Beware."
4,High Quality Tools,"Great tools, sharp and high quality. Case is nice and I think these bits will last a while. What I expect from Freud."
1,one of the worst horror (comedy) movies I've ever seen!,"This movie was absolutely a poor try! extremly weak special effects for late 80s, bad and senseless acting, weak scene design and rather a weak scenario! trust me, don't buy it and even don't rent it!"
3,More Like Phantom of the Kreugers.,"Ok, i admit this movie was ok, but it's more like another one of Robert Englunds Freddy Krueger slsher movies rather then the Pahntom of the Opera. This movie has barely anything to do with the phantom of the opera, in fact it shouldn't even have the title ""The Pahotm of the Opera"" it should be something like ""The Phantom of the Freddy Kreuger"" or ""The Pahntom of the slasher."" or something like that."
1,"To Crypt ""thecrypt777""","I really liked this guys review and he already said alot of things I cannot think of saying. However, I did give this movie one star because I found Englund's acting to be off. The movie scenes were good and the story was well known but the acting was off and very stiff. Englund should have half of his face disfigured instead of his whole face, it probably would make people stop calling it Freddy goes to the Opera."
4,Better than Webber... storywise,This version reflects the Novel more than the Webber Version which is why I liked it more actually. If it were made now I think it would have been better and tried to be less of a slasher movie.. but I loved the supernatural elements of it. The music it did have in it I thought was very good. Of course I love the music in the Webber version but it just is not scary enough or at all. I think any Phantom adaptation should be somewhat scary and I think this version does it nicely.
1,help! too bloody...,"gosh that's too bloody for me! and it makes no sense! and why christine is ""christine day"" but not ""christine daae""?! it drives me crazy and it's not worth to buy this dvd. you should have da 2004's ALW phantom of the opera but not this horrible movie."
2,ehh. it was sort of good,"this movie is pretty darn far off from the book. don juan triumphant had the same meaning but the music and the wording sounds more like a lullabye is that how you spell it ? andrew lloyd webber's version was better. in this movie i think the phantom is too vicious in this movie. if you had no skin wouldn't be easier and less painful to just wear a mask? and what's with the villain winning !? the only scene that is relatively close to the book is the punjab lasso/street scene. well, except for the skinning part. and what's with the ""London Opera House"" , Christine ""Day"", and ""Richard"" ? they couldn't get the copyright on the names and yet they coul on the great opera, ""Faust"". by the way, who is that dude who always plays the devil in the movies [flashback during faust] oh, by the way, another relatively close scene is the graveyard scene."
1,"this ""Phantom"" is just plain DISTURBING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Ok,whoever wrote the plot for this movie have some seriously wrong feelings and thoughts on this subject!!!!! I have not even seen this movie, (but I have the soundtrack and I heard about it.)and I have No desire to see it. I mean , it's not even based in Paris!!!! It's first in New York with a wanna-be Broadway star and then we ""time-travel"" a hundred years back to London!!!!!!! HELLO IN THERE?!!!!!!!!!! And then we got some guy who is supposed to be the Erik from the book who wears a mask that is skin from the people he kills and sews it on!!!!!!!!!! if you don't like bloody,gross,things like ripping people in half,(like me!)then do NOT see this because whoever wrote this is on crack!!!!!!!!!"
1,I Can't Believe I Initially Liked This Garbage.,"When I first saw this film in, I think, 2005, I gave it a 5-star review and claimed it was unfairly rated R. But then I saw it again for the first time several years later, and was apalled that I ever liked this piece of gory, bloody trash. Avoid this film at all costs. Not as bad as ""Scarface"" (1983) or ""Full Metal Jacket,"" but almost as bad with its unrelenting graphic violence and The Phantom's stitching himself back together. Makes me wanna vomit all over the screen. Rated R, but should have been rated NC-17 for strong prevasive graphic violence."
3,A Paradox,"For ALW's Phantom of the Opera fans, it's important to note that this movie bears virtually no resemblance to the musical both in, obviously, music and also in quality of acting and in overall quality of the production. This is, basically, a PotO horror story, but as far as horror stories go this one is good. Englund as the Phantom is a highly skilled actor and his rendition of the Phantom in this film is exceptionally well done. Unfortunately, however, Schoelen's abilities are far less and she gives us at best a mediocre performance as Christine Daae (Day) -- something akin to those old ""B"" movies.As the critics have repeatedly stated, this is NOT the classic, immortal PotO given to us by Andrew Lloyd Webber, but it is nonetheless worth a look."
4,One of the better versions,"I think each version of the Phantom adds something to the genre, but none have equalled the content of the novel. This version stands up against the recent 2004 film version of the Webber musical (the make-up in the Webber film is awful and looks like a bad skin problem rather than a deformity--the stage version had far better make-up). This 1989 version is better than the 1943 and 1962 versions, although not as good as the 1925 Lon Chaney classic. Robert Englund does an excellent job of bringing the character to life, the make-up is very good, the soundtrack is excellent, the acting is first-rate. If you love the novel and are open to varied renditions of the content, this DVD should find a welcome home next to the versions of Lon Chaney, Claude Rains, and Herbert Lom. Thanks to MGM for bringing this cult classic to us in DVD form."
1,Doesn't even deserve one star,"This film version takes away everything that is wonderful about 'The Phantom of the Opera' and blows it all to hell. Andrew Lloyd Webber's version and the original novel contain so much beauty, so much romanticism, so many haunting images... This terrible Robert Englund film is just a cheap horror film. It's not even scary... it's gross. So it doesn't even work as an effective horror film. It's more a slasher flick. Englund (of Freddy Krueger fame) totally misses the opportunity to play an effective Phantom. He just snarls and grunts and isn't menacing at all. 'The Phantom of the Opera' is one of the most romantic tales of all time. There's no love here. I mean, there are these fights scenes where the Phantom murders people. It's quite pathetic. And then, there are these parallels to modern times??? It's ridicolus. What a miserable film..."
2,"Poor, poor example of Phantom","OK...all I have to say is: Freddy as The Phantom????? NO!!!!!!This movie showed promise, but it became more of a slasher/Jack the Ripper-ish movie with a phantom that must sew a new face on periodically (and he hunts down victims to get new skin for his messed up face....creepy).Only purchase this to put in your Phantom movie collection...watch it once, then forget about it. I saw it back in 1989 and viewed it again 6 months ago. I won't be watching it again for awhile...."
1,"Slasher ""operetta"" not for Phans","I'm shocked that this movie has been rated half as well as it's been. Of course, if you're a fan of slasher movies first and foremost, and tPotO second, this one might be for you. However, I'm more of a Phan than anything else, and to say that this film was a gross disappointment is a travesty of understatement.First of all, there's time travel. Second of all, good bye Paris setting, hello London with Jack the Ripper cross overs. I do approve of the Faust parallels, but that's about it. Any movie with Molly Shannon of SNL fame and Bill Nighy (the last movie I saw him in was ""Shaun of the Dead"" - maybe that sets the tone?) can't be good. Oh, and there's no Raoul. Or much semblance of the original story line, either.Overall, this was one huge waste of time and money. I don't recommend it to Phans - but maybe to those of Freddy Kreuger, bad cliches, bad acting, late 80s fashion, and just plain bastardization of a great story."
2,not so bad,"It's a great film in her time, but the story change alote in this film, and have parts the phantom looks disgusting, and the part of second live its very exaggerated and ilogic."
3,Good old' robert.....,"Being a huge Elm Street fan,I was excited when I saw this movie for 8.66 at wal-mart. It's not the best movie I've seen..Parts were extremely cheap and just not needed in the movie but it still had a somewhat interesting concept. But Robert Englund still does a pretty good job of being the bad guy from hell, so I gave it 3 stars. It's good movie for a laugh, and maybe a little digust if you don't like seening people sewing skin together...."
2,"Phantom Phans, beware!","The very first thing I have to say about this movie is ""Ick, ick, ICK."" Now, don't get me wrong, it does have it's good points (I looooove gore. Since early childhood I've been weaned on it), but they're pretty obscure. The portrayal of Christine was rather good, but I do NOT like what they did to Erik. First of all, I have a hard time imagining him with a prostitute(!) and in the book, his Don Juan Triumphant meant so much more than a vehicle to make him famous. I believe this movie to *not* be for Phantom lovers, but it's GREAT for horror movie fans. In that respect, I really enjoyed it."
4,A retelling of the classic story,"An aspiring opera singer is transported to Victorian-era London and into the arms of a disfigured and evil maestro determined to make her a star. Christine experiences the joys of success until she realizes that her lover has been murdering people to make her success possible. He's not gonna stop until he has completed a masterpiece of blood.This is a very different tale than what we have come to know. The violence is the focus here. The original version of this tale is more of a well rounded story. It mixes the love and killing quite well. In this version the murderous nature of the Phantom is focused on more heavily. That being said, this is still a pretty entertaining movie. It's a great watch for any fan of the slasher horror genre."
5,Freddy's got a new gig,"I really liked this movie. It is a nice change to the orginal Phantom of the Opera and a gory one at that. The acting was very good and the story line solid. Don't get me wrong, I do like the orginal and the remake of the orginal that was a big Hollywood hit. But this one puts a different edge on the story and it makes it a little different and interesting also. I do recommend it to any horror fan that likes the story of The Phantom of the Opera."
4,"First Freddy, then the Phantom, Whose Next...",Robert Englud is the only reason to see this film. He takes the role of The Phantom to the extreme. Robert is an excellent pick for this film to play the phantom. The movie really dosen't follow the broadway version. Or by the original book. But it was still pretty good. But i think it could've been a little scaryer. But Robert Englund Rocks.
4,The best Phantom ever!,"I purchased this video because I am a great fan of all things ""Phantom"" (and it was in a sale!)and I loved it! I was, however, somewhat bemused by the decision to set the story in London rather than Paris and I tend to cringe somewhat in the scene of the Phantom's origin (I won't give too much away!) but other than that it was great. I was interested to see that they gave Erik a last name which apparently could have really been his name according to historians! The chronology is somewhat muddled but it generally remains true to the spirit of the origional novel. I thought the Phantom's mask was sheer genius and very origional! It's a good job this is a buget video because, judging by the number of times that I have watched it since I got it two weeks ago, I'll have worn it out within six months! You MUST see this film - the photography is stunning, the sets amazing and what you hear of ""Don Juan Triumphant"" is absoloutly beautiful (Does anyone know where I can get it?)."
1,Words can't even describe the horror.,"Well to start the movie is nothing like the book it's like the writers never read a page or even opened up the book characters are missing and new one's are created the phantom looks more like Freddy than they way he is decribed in the book. Everything that made the book and the 1925 silent film great is not in here the love story lacks the horror isn't even scary the story makes no since the entire film is daul and horrible. If I could give it less stars I would ""0"" is the true number of stars this film deserves. The one thing that is good about it is the costume that the phantom is wearing at the masquerade looks like it should other than that this movie was worthless in my eyes. I'll stick to the book, the silent film, and the musical."
1,if the filmmakers had only read the book,"the Phantom is a subject of much curiousity, both in film, and in related books. Unfortunatly, the film-makers seem not to have read the book. There is much bloody violence that is simply NOT a part of the story, nor is it needed in their interpretation. I have just finished watching the DVD of this film. It dishonored the author.However, I did give it one star....I was curious to see how the film-makers completed the story. I was not satisfied. There is what I would call ""gratuitous"" blood-letting.....it was unneccessary.Since I borrowed this DVD from a library, I cannot say that I was cheated on the price, but, I would not recommend it.I would recommend reading the book. It is far better than this film."
1,upsetting,"After reading Gaston Leroux's original novel AND watching the 2004 Phantom of the Opera, this movie completely threw me off. Many ""Phans"" know that Erik had murdered people, but this movie depicted a serial killer Erik, that would kill anyone (and that means ANYONE). Meanwhile the music in this was very ""weak"". The main song that was really sung was a VERY revised verison of ""Don Juan Triumphiant"", which was completely the opposite of what I expected it to be. Rent the movie before buying. However dedicated ""Phans"" may not enjoy it compared to the 2004 and stage version of PoTo."
3,When Freddy Met Opera...,"When this film was first released in 1989 it was dismissed as a so-so 80s horror fluff. Yes, it is a little gory and yes Robert Englund (AKA Freddy Krueger himself) is very menacing, or should I say nightmarish as ""The Phantom."" Good atmosphere and some genuine chills abound. What looses some of its credibility is the time travelling part. That is weak and really stupid. Still, solid direction from horror vet Dwight H. Little still make this one a keeper."
5,Fantastic!,This is a great sounding system! I would definitely buy again. The subwoofer is a little large but it sounds great. I also highly recommend the Polk SA2 speaker stands. They are made for this system and include all the hardware you need. The speakers sound best at the height set by the SA2 stands.
4,;0),"its the same plot you see over and over but i liked the movie i think everyone did a great job and was believable in their roles. It shows that you cant judge a book by its cover, Common's characters was a likable guy even though it took him a while to notice the woman who was really right for him."
3,Enjoyable movie,"This movie won't necessarily offer too many surprises, unless you count a pro-basketball player who is a pretty good guy right from the start (rather than learning to be a good guy through his recovery process, as might be expected). The antagonist-role female falls into trope behavior, but overall I enjoyed Queen Latifah's performance and the movie itself."
5,Just right!,"Enjoyable film! I went to the theatres to see it when it first came out and knew I needed it in my collection. Being a fan of both Common and Queen Latifah's music, I figured I would be a fan of the movie as well."
5,Loved it!,"Don't know why, but I was hesitant to watch this movie. But it ended up being an all around great movie. Made me love Common even more."
4,Just Wright,I just received it in good condition. I like the work of Queen Latifah and the story is good like it very much.
5,Wonderful and Uplifting Movie,A really well done and entertaining movie. Addresses many aspects of real life and how best to handle them. Truly inspirational!
5,Not a simple love story,"Never saw the movie during theatrical realease. First viewed while traveling on an airplane accross country. Decided I had to see it but could never remember the name of the movie. Have watched it every time it has been on cable with my wife. There are some movies you can watch at anytime....this is one of those movies. The on screen dynamic from all of the actors in very well casted roles make this play out more like real life than a movie. (Yeah, I know...but it is true).Though it plays on cable every so often, having it during the holiday season while we are all home together is a must. Not sure why I did not purchase years ago."
4,Really like this movie,"Got this on sale last week and was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked this movie. I have enjoyed Latifah and Common in other roles and while this movie isn't perfect, I love that it is just a plain ol' fashioned love story!! And SOOOOOOOOOO NICE!! to see a black cast in no more turmoil than a little love angst......Lovely movie....."
5,"""SOCIALLY CHANGING"", DELIVERS HOPE","Just a simple story, with some romantic silliness, not much to take seriously--hun?!--.THAT'S NOT ""JUST WRIGHT"". This movie crossed some American social-lines that we thought were unbreakable. The black man wins his black woman; the black woman believes and accepts his romance; the seriously (romantic) star is not skinny; the star is not helpless but she is loving and vunerable: just a girl who falls hard for a guy but she keeps her pride until he wakes up to smell the cream in his coffee. Then 'happiness' that we can believe in is on its gosomer wings and this movie leaves you flying high.I said it after each four viewings of this movie: ""This movie has it...that magic!"" And I was right: 'Just Wright' is still right for me; I'm going to buy the video for my library. I love its magic!--MO"
5,IT WAS GREAT!,GREAT MOVIE! WHAT I EXPECTED OF QUEEN LATIFAH! ALSO THE COMPANY I PURCHASED FROM OCEANWIDE MEDIA PROVIDED PROMPT SERVICE!THE MOVIE WAS GOOD SPIRITED AND SOMETHING THE WHOLE FAMILY CAN WATCH ON MOVIE NIGHT!
5,Great Combo,"Who doesn't love the ""Queen""? I must say Common is not bad his self. This is definately going to be played at least once a week in my house."
3,Just Wright,"I loved this movie years ago when it was released. . I had been waiting for price to drop before purchasing. I am disappointed, the plot is slow and Common needs some acting lessons. I will definitely resell this movie. I recommend you watch it first before you buy"
5,I'm in LOVE,I saw the movie-then I met Common!!! OMG-he is so sexy without even trying. He and the Queen made such a good looking couple and they seemed to get along real well. That's what good actors do. By the way I am a 67 yr. old senior and Common's biggest fan!!!!
5,Love the pair up,"If you're looking for a feel good movie with some excellent eye candy, this is your go to movie! Common and Queens Latifah have fantastic on screen chemistry. A great watch!"
3,Cute movie,This movie is a cute love story. I really enjoyed Common's character (great eye candy!) and Queen Latifah did a surprisingly good job.
3,Not sold as advertised,"I purchased this DVD in like new condition and it was warped. If a product is sold in like new condition, it should actually perform like one in like new condition not make so much noise you can hardly hear the movie."
1,"Cliche, Corny and Predicatable. Poor writing.","Queen Latifah plays an over weight physical trainer who's passion for the Nets, and her unexpected run in with Nets star player Scott McKnight at a gas station (Common) leads to an ""unexpected"" love affair. It also leads to a high profile career in the NBA as a Trainer.... uh, yeah sure.The plot is as far fetched as the writing is cerebral. Everything about this film is horrible. From the corny game Latifah kicks, to the fact we're watching a film about the Nets, yet the film has absolutely no historical connection to the team.After 15 mins of watching the film, you'll be able to predict the entire film."
1,Spare yourselves - save the children!,"It'd be great if there were a burning black hole this could fall into. Watching that would be more entertaining than this movie.Don't get me wrong, I love rom-coms! But this? YUCK. The acting is atrocious, editing choppy, jokes are all stupid and heard them before, the only entertaining part was having spanish subtitles that didn't fully translate and we started racing each other to say the subtitles.Just watch The Proposal again if you want a good night's entertainment."
5,NOW OUR MINDS ARE ONE,"THIS IS A WONDERFUL, BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL, MOVING CD.It is one of my, if not my very favorite cd.I wish the very best for this artist, Lawrence Laughing, and look forward to more cds by him."
5,Joni,perfect! (I dont speak english.... sorry.... but I like the dvd and I'm so glad... ;-) thanks a lot! )
2,Poor film quality...nothing new or interesting.,"I am a huge Joni Mitchell fan but was disappointed with this video. It makes sense the film quality would be low since she was at her peak quite some time ago...but the actual selection of songs, etc is pretty darn boring."
4,This book shows the pain and humor of adolescent life.,"This book is funny, but yet deals with many serious issues in a teenager's life. It is great for teenagers."
3,My daughter's review through me,"My daughter's review of this book was not as good as the first...it wasn't as exciting, and much more boring. No, climax to the plot. But, the first made the second very disappointing, according to her. Oh - she's 11."
4,Help to Set you Free!,"Interesting book but not terribly insightful. I will always be appreciative of Miller's focus on childhood drama and trauma, but I did not learn much from this particular book. I do like the term ""emotional blindness"", however, and like Miller's emphasis on emotional insight as a prerequisite for overcoming childhood abuse. The real key term for me, and I don't believe Miller uses it, is the concept of a paradigm shift. From shaming and blaming to personal freedom and self assertion: this is facilitated by addressing the child's conception of the cause of the abuse. It, the badness, is not in the child but experienced by the child. As adults, the emphasis should be on reconstructing the meaning of past trauma as it was perceived by the child at the time. I differ from Miller on her preference for not using antidepressants in severe cases. The medication could facilitate the healing process and thus make insight more tolerable."
2,Sizing was off,"Was cute, but was WAY too large according to their sizing chart. Would recommend ordering a size smaller than intended."
5,Soap Dish - just right,"This was EXACTLY what I have been looking for. I have searched local stores from dollar stores on up. So I tried Amazon. Having had a similar one in my kitchen that had a piece broken on it, I was looking to replace it. The only thing was, the postage was more than I liked, but then USPS is not always pleasing these days. Thanks for having just what I wanted."
5,Works as expected,"I used it for installing 2 cable grommets into a Office Depot office desk I had purchased. I had forgotten to order the bit at the time, and just picked up the brand Home Depot had. Everything fit fine as Milwaukee uses standard sized and places holes. Worked great with no issues."
3,Good for learning how not to confuse students.,"I thought this book was all right in providing material for teachers who write horrible tests. Almost any student would be able to read this book and possible find out the ways teachers write their tests and therefore they might have a better chance at doing well on tests. The author does not really give adequate information on giving students grades though. Where the subject of grading is difficult in the best conditions, he does not provide much help in that area. There is also a typo on page 110."

2,2 peices of tiny metal found in 1 bag.,Thank god that i tasted the metal before i swallowed them. I dont even get how it got mixed up with this. The candy itself is sex in mouth.
5,Magical Realism at its best,"I loved the movie. I'm a huge fan of Latin American magical realism, so I might have enjoyed the film on a different level than someone who is not familiar with this particular genre. You definitely need to suspend disbelief, but once you do, you will be able to truly enjoy the magic of this movie about undying love.Be warned, It is NOT a happy movie, it definitely made me feel sad, but I enjoyed it nonetheless."
5,Tech Info,"Great gay film ever! Trust me buy this BD!wanna say that the bd is region free :) (as it say Clone DVD HD software)i can play it on my notebook, bd player and ps3, all pal region B locked :)No subtitles included, only spanish audio in 6ch or 2ch ;)"
5,One of the most beautiful movies ever,"People in situations you've never seen, in locals you've never visited keeping your on the edge of your mental seat for the entire film. The best writing, acting and directing I've seen for a long time. Where were the academy awards on this film???"
5,Undertow,This is my new favourite movie. It is a warm and sad love story that shows how the heart truly rules the head in love.
1,Very Sad,I ordered the Undertow foreign film from 2010. I got an American Undertow from 2004 which had nothing to do with the movie I really wanted. I did get full credit for the dvd & I was told I could reorder the dvd. I figured I would go thorough the same situation and ordered it form TLA Video that specialized in gay and cult films.
4,All Around Quality !!,"Great buy !! Complete Organ Works, 6 cd's, delivered to my mailbox in less than a week for $17.22 !!!!Walter Kraft did a fine job !! These 1957 recordings at the Organ of the Marienkirche, Lubeck, Germany are all around quality !Buxtehude was a visionary composer who towered above his contemporaries. Telemann, Handel, Bach, and many others traveled to hear Buxtehude play, and were all influenced by this great master.I prefer his sonatas and chamber music as his greatest accomplishments.When I ripped these 6 cd's to my computer I found disc 2 canceled out disc 1, and disc 5 would not rip at all because it thought it was a disc already ripped onto my computer. So, only 3 tracks from disc 1 remained after disc 2 overwrote 26 of the 29 tracks. All of disc 2, 3, 4, and 6 ripped onto the computer, 5 would not rip.Good day friends !!!"
3,Noticeable edits,"I don't know why this collection has such excellent reviews. The playing is very good and tasteful, beautiful instrument, no sound quality issues. But a lot of mistakes were edited out, especially on longer pieces, and the abundant cuts are all abrupt and noticeable. In each case, the previous note/chord breaks immediately rather than fading out and the new note jolts in suddenly, with no overlap. You could do a better editing job with I-tunes--assuming you stop after each error, which probably didn't happen. For what it's worth, I wasn't listening for errors, and I don't approach music with a score card in hand. But I can't help hearing the edits and they ruin an otherwise excellent recording. At $25, well worth it anyway, if you're like me and wondering why in the world you don't have this compilation. But I'd rather pay $10-$15 more for a perfect recording with a blip or two every so often."
5,Glad I purchased this book,I would recommend this book to anyone who desires a greater understanding of the covenant that we have through the blood of Jesus. Even if you have studied covenant before by other authors this book continues to help you gain insight and understanding of that which Jesus has provided for us through a covenant relationship with our eternal everlasting God.
1,"Run away, fast!","I read about 20 pages of this book while a woman sitting across the aisle from me was reading it on a three hour flight.My goodness, I just could not believe what I was reading.Wilkerson is the kind of author that can develop a whole chapter on a book from just second guessing the intent of the author of an obscure translation of a bible passage. After that he goes out on unbelievable tangents that probably only make sense to the initiated in his logic.I would strongly suggest for people to steer clear from this kind of religious fundamentalism and try to read more moderate literature on the subject.Scary."
1,Never Received From Amazon,This is the only item I have ever oredered and pay for from Amazon that I did not recieve.
4,Real Estate Advertising Made Easy,Very easy to use and helpful in prompting creative wording for each individual listings.
5,Great reference for the student!,"This book was used in my Advanced Placement English course in high school, and was so thorough I had to buy a copy of my own to take with me to college! Contains a wealth of literature, from short stories and novel excerpts to poems and full-length works of drama. This guide also contains comprehensive literary criticism to compliment the pieces delivered, as well as a guide to writing and reading critically--a must for any college English student!"
4,Another happy customer,I received the book in a timely manner and happy with the condition. Definitely will order from this seller again.Trong
3,Fussy Recipes,"I haven't found anything in here that I'd make on a weeknight. There are some nice recipes that would be great for company, or when you feel like spending some time in the kitchen on the weekend, but they're a bit too precious for everyday. I don't know when this was published, but the food styling seems kind of dated and the recipes a bit overdone."
2,Not Heavy Duty,"The product description here and at dig it pet's website would have you believe that the wire on this crate is heavy duty. It's not. It isn't as heavy as the Midwest Select Crate. I'll go ahead and use this one, as the shipping costs to return it will cost more than it is worth. However, I'll be replacing it with the select crate after my dobie finishes snacking on this one."
3,Get just what you pay for,"Not a bad crate for the money. We were very happy with it for the first three months. However, after three months our 70 lb. schnauzer poodle mix was able to bend and bite through the wire mesh. The description on this item notes that it is built with thicker gauge wire than other similar crates. It did not appear to be any thicker than other crates. I'll be shopping for a more solidly built crate, but if your dog doesn't chew or act up when crated this crate isn't a bad option for the money."
2,Packaging,"Several items were shipped in a box with no restraining packaging material inside the box. The items were not damaged but the display boxes for each item were severely damaged due to continual impacting against each other during shipment. A damaged display box will affect the assumed ""newness"" and possible resale of an item."
3,It's aiight,This album is better than Genie of the Lamp but not as good as Thizzelle Washington. That extacy may have finally gotten to Dre...
4,Panasonic Net Cam SW,Solid. I use the motion control to snare visitors before they surprise me. It has motion sensitivity and control. It'll handle 1 to 100 cameras. Cams can be on the web or LAN.
3,Early Haunted Ship Ghost Story,"This volume of Blackwoods tales is noted for ""Christmas Eve on a Haunted Hulk"" by Frank Cowper. It's the story of a haunted ship comparable to those of Weird Tales author William Hope Hodgson."
5,Awsome Speakers,These are really excellent speakers. Installed them on my 96 Mercury Sable with no trouble. The tweeter was very clean and small woofer was tight. I will buy my second set to install on the rear doors on my Sable.
5,Echoes of Blakey & Silver.,"Art Gore from Cincinatti has been musically hypnotising his listeners for 50 years or so. This cd/album is a testimonial to Art's musicianship not only as a percussionist but as an arranger and composer. Mr. Gore had studied drums with the great Alan Dawson in Boston who taught Tony Williams and Clifford Jarvis. To hear Art Gore play live in a club is an event one will never forget it. Here on this cd are strong compositions performed by first rate, hand picked musicians from the Cincinatti area. The recording quality is excellent sounding very much like most Blue Note records of the 50's and 60's. This record is hard to find but if you run across it anywhere buy it. This cd is a priceless jewel."
3,Great & Poor - Sender Made Amends,"Two shows on this cassette, both excellent. However, first had color problem & line throughout. When I told vendor, agreed to pay for return & refund. HOWEVER, I wanted 2nd show, which was fine, so I didn't take vendor up on it. Vendor DID credit my account 30% of my costs, nonetheless. Integrity of vendor was excellent!"
4,Creative thought,Have your children investigate every page carefully- this book encourages self-awareness and promotes the exploration of the subconscious
4,Without words,"I bought this book for a young child, who can not read yet. This will help the child read to the new infant that is coming soon. I wanted something without text"
4,Great for student reference!,"This book is a great resource for students--public schooler, homeschooler, and private schoolers. Homeschoolers can easily use this book to create their own spelling curriculum, based on words pulled from the student's weekly reading."
2,SAMHSA,"This publication is out of date, but has been revised. The new TIP 44, Substance Abuse Treatment for Adults in the Criminal Justice System is available FREE OF CHARGE from SAMHSA by calling 1-877-SAMHSA-7 (1-877-726-4727), inventory number (SMA)05-4056. You can also check out this and other TIPs on the SAMHSA website at [...]"
4,movie REALLY hits home with teens,"I use this in a college literature course as a means of clarifying and analyzing Joyce Carol Oates' short story ""Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?"" which is, in and of itself, a CREEPY story -- especially for teens! Smooth Talk is the adaptation of that work and is pretty well done -- it holds the attention of modern-day teens which is saying something. Even though time has changed technology, the subjects of acceptance and teen-parent relationships is timeless. It's certainly an ""oldie"" but had managed to hold onto its relevance (Thanks to Oates)."
1,Short Story Fans Will Be Disappointed,"Leave it to the movie industry to completely sanitize an artfully crafted and disturbing story about a conflicted teen's coming of age and sexual awakening. When I discovered that there was a film adaptation of this Oates' story and that it had been casted with the seductive and cagey Laura Dern, I expected, at the very least, that the basic storyline would have been preserved. That Chopra changed the ending of this classic short story is truly disappointing--Ms. Oates, how could you allow it? The sappy love-hate relationship between Connie and her mother is phony, the actress who played Connie's weird sister could use more than a few more drama lessons, and the character of Arnold Friend has been reduced to a dorky and only slightly creepy Rick Springfield look-a-like. This film project should have been handed to David Lynch."
2,More rocky than smooth,"A coming-of-age movie about a teenage girl (Laura Dern) whose chief interest in life is getting it on with some guy. She goes parading all over town looking for likely prospects until she meets Treat Williams, who is much older. They spend a lot of time ""smooth talking"" each other seeing who will gain the upper hand. Dern gets her way and appears changed. I didn't find this movie very memorable. Dern did better work elsewhere."
5,The very best of Brennan Manning,"This is Manning at his very best. I have given this book many times as gifts to others, always with great reviews. Manning's own deep walk with the Lord shines through this book to every reader."
2,murrrr,"Not bad...But I'd get a Kelley Varner book instead, save your money and get a book that will really change your life. :)"
1,This is a book about Universalism not Christianity,"I recommend reading John Caddock's review in Journal of the Grace Evangelical Society, Vol. 10, #19 before purchasing this book. According to Caddock, Manning places experientially based learning above scriptural truths instead of using God's Word as sideboards to understanding. Caddock labels Manning's ""contemplative spirituality"" as dangerous. I would tend to agree."
5,True insight into our lifelong walk with Jesus.,"God spoke to me through the writings of Brennan Manning. Going through spiritual darkness, myself, it pulled me through to the light. It gives one the revelation of ""dying to self"", not just to the ""wrongs"" but to the self-imposed ""rights"". ""The Signature of Jesus"" causes one to look deeply inside to evaluate their relationship with the Father through the Son and examine self-centeredness and self-gratification, leading them to renounce such and be carried into living daily grace."
5,Fun Read!,"Piziks does a fine job with the VOYAGER crew. You can hear them saying these lines in your head! The aliens are way cool, and the plot kept me turning pages.I also found out he writes ""regular"" science novels under the name Steven Harper. I don't know why he uses a pen name for these books, but they're also great reads!"
3,Better,Its nice to see the Viyager books developing though the big wuestion is whether or not they'll get a new life like DS9 has gotten thru the books. Hoepfully so there's a lot that can be mined here and should be.
3,Pretty good Voyager book,"This book was a good book. But it wasn't without its weaknesses.First, I must say that I was glad to finally get another Voyager book! Despite being 'hated' by many Star Trek fans, Voyager still has a big fan base.Anyway, one minor problem with this book was that it followed the TV series' final episode. Therefore, this book couldn't allow for any more attempts at getting Voyager home (since we know the outcome).But, the story itself was very interesting. It had a couple of good plot twists throughout. I do think 7 of 9 is used a little too much. Plus, Harry Kim fans will be disappointed to know that he has very limited dialogue in this book. It does refer to the future relationship of Chakotay and Seven.Good book for Voyager fans. For casual Voyager fans, you may want to read other Trek books first."
3,Not so great.,"Good for purposes of nostalgia, but not all that great. There isn't much selection in the area of vintage comedy, but it is worth a look."
2,Badly written book about an interesting individual,"First things first -- I've gobbled up several books about the Clinton White House -- the best of which is Ambrose-Pritchard's ""The Secret Life of Bill Clinton."" I found ""Damage Control,"" the offical autobiography of Larry Nichols, to be a below-average read. Though Nichol's is an interesting personality, this book is poorly written. Most annoying is the fact that the author, David Breshnahan, constantly repeats himself from one chapter to the next. I remember doing this in Jr. High School when I needed to write an essay X number of pages long. Another disappoinment is the Appendix where evidence is presented to support Nichol's story. This should have been the beefiest part, but instead we only get an appetizer. Bottom line: If you have read books by Pritchard, Aldrich, et al., and you crave more, ""Damage Control"" still might be worth $15 -- one thing it will do is stir your anger, Liberal or Conservative."
1,Beware - Product Switch,I bought a 256MB USBDrive from this vendor and although this page clearly names and shows shows a high quality USBDrive the vendor is actually shipping an Aigo unit. A flimsy low cost unit not at all comparableable to a USBDrive
4,"VHS BEWARE, said video and I was dumb enough to buy it","It's steve taylor, few good videos not as good as his old stuff, but this one is VHS so unless you love VHS you wont know what to do with it, hence why it is here and they can't sell it!"
3,not that good,"this is the second book i read from siegel and i have to say both were quite dissapointing...the build up was quite fascinating, you keep getting into situation where you are stuck and can;t get out of it but during the final conclusion to reveal the truth, it is very dissapointing. it's like there's no thrill to it. like the way nick hanson said, it;s the way you tell the story and i was very dissapointed."
2,r/c snowmobile,the item was much smaller than I thought it would be. It was not usable outdoors. I was unhappy and returned the purchase.
4,Very nice idea! And it works!,This book did wonders for myself and my boyfriend. Most of the questions in the book were things we'd never think to ask one another. It helps get a clearer view of the person you're dating.
3,Getting To Know You..... or Is It,There are several good questions in this book. However I wouldn't recommend using most of the questions when you just met the opposite person. Alot of them are very personal. Also many of the questions repeat themselves. I suppose this book could be fun if you already have a partner. The title is misleading. They should call it getting to know your partner better.
1,SELLER oncesoldtales ARE THEIEVES,"I ordered a book from these [...] on 12/13/2010. They lied and said it was shipped via the Post Office on 12/14. Note: It takes 2 business days for the Post Office to deliver from Washington state to California.It is now Jan. 11, 2011...NO Book. NO email Response. NO Action yet completed by Amazon. GIVE. Me. A. Break !!DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THESE PEOPLE~!! [...] DO IT...AND YOU'LL REGRET IT. I NOW HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE BANK TO CANCEL ALL OF THESE CHARGES---SINCE I PAID FOR SOMETHING THAT 1.) THEY NEVER SENT AND 2.) I NEVER RECEIVED!!!! [...]"
2,Pretty Things - 'Savage Eye' (Snapper),"Originally released in 1975,as this was the last album the band recorded,just prior to vocalist Phil May exiting the group.Thus,after that Pretty Things decided to call it a day.Good thing,TOO.Because it doesn't appear that there were any other original members left.Of course as most of you know they didn't reunite until a while later.Unfortunately,'Savage Eye' simply doesn't cut it.Unless you're a Pretty Things completist,you might want to avoid this CD altogether.A couple of tracks I thought were so-so were ""Under The Volcano"",""Remember That Boy"" and ""It's Been So Long"".Line-up:Phil May-guitar&vocals,Jack Green-guitar,Gordon Edwards-bass,Norman Smith-sax and Skip Allan-drums."
5,a beautiful portrait of bluegrass music,"The people who said this isn't a good history of bluegrass have a point; as a history, it's idiosyncratic and incomplete. On the other hand, as a portrait of the music and some of its creators it's unforgettable. I must have watched this movie 15 times over the past ten or eleven years, and it can still bring tears to my eyes."
3,High Lonesome-The Story of Bluegrass Music...DVD,"High Lonesome-The Story of Blue grass Music, a DVD, was great in story content, but because we have a ""regular"" DVD player, the sound quality was not very good. Turned up as high as possible, we still could barely hear it. Maybe a hd TV would help."
2,Save your money,"This is an outdated, very limited documentary on Bluegrass, with a few interviews, most of them looking like they were done in the 1970s. There are huge gaps in this ""story of Bluegrass music"" -- if you know anything at all about the history, you will be shocked at what is left out. It's not even a good introduction, nor a good general overview, to Bluegrass. I saw a MUCH better documentary on CMT's bluegrass week back in January 2002. What a dissappointment this DVD is!"
5,ALL THAT!!!!,"These guys really prove the passion behind the lowridin culture. It shows what success can bring with hard work and dedication. I reccomend this video to all lowriders and anybody who may be interested or curious. Lowridin is not just a hobby, it's a way of life. Keep your head up Gangster. You'll be back soon and will build something even better than Santana. -peace"
5,Sunday driver was tight,"This DVD gave an awesome insight into the Compton chapter of the Majestics CC. It has some great footage, a must have DVD for any real lowrider like myself. This is not some truucha style dvd... you get to see clean cars tapping bumper and laying frame. Thats how it should be!"
5,Now this one works,"I had ordered this before and the one I got skiped so bad that I decided to get a new one, and this was it and this one works great. Now I am happy. if you love PRDT you have to have this one."
5,dino thunder,it is oone off the best power ranger shows and on this dvd you see a loot. of action and advencher and power rangers .find the idanty of the mistyes whate rangers if you power ranger fan you like it.
3,Did nothing for me,"2.5 or so.......I first heard Beth Orton on the soundtrack for a film called ""A Room for Romeo Brass."" Fine film, fine soundtrack. One if the highlights was a song called Stolen Car by the previously unknown (to me) Beth Orton. Well worked, well arranged, well evoked, the song was a winner. After listening to that soundtrack for years, I finally jumped in and bought this collection.Stolen Car is the best song here. Ahead of the pack by several miles. Many of the other cuts sound very reminiscent (or blatantly derivative) of it, with a similar beat and structure. Just not as interesting. She is a talented singer, but not much of a songwriter. She hit gold once. But those that don't sound like Stolen Car, sound kinda, well, kinda nothing. She's sad, life is hard, love sometimes stinks. Yeah, yeah, yeah.There are plenty of reviews here extolling her genius. I didn't hear it. She's got something, but needs far stronger material, both musically and lyrically, to make me care about it."
2,Didn't she quit the music biz for her kids in 2006?,"I'm not a fan ...sorry fan base.She slur's the lyric so badly I can understand her maybe 25 percent of time. I've ask friend and family to listen and tell me some of the lyric; its not happening.If she could supply the actual words to every song she sings, she might sell more music. I can't recommend this album or anything done by her. I like the music intro's before she kicks in thou.Save your money."
4,A must have for any shop!,"This set is worth the money for anyone serious about woodworking. These bits offer the most controlled cutting available when used with a drill press. Especially usefull for cutting shallow or flat bottom mortises, partial circles laid over the edge of your stock, and holes drilled at an angle to the surface. The carbide edges offer much longer life between sharpenings. Also the 1 3/8"" size is perfect for european cup hinges."
3,Disappointing,This is my second experience with Freud cutting tools. The first was their 8 inch super dado set. It had to be exchanged due toseveral chips in the carbide cutting edges. The replacement has performed adequately. This forstner bit set produced disappointing results for the money. The surface of the workpiece had burrs where the bit first made contact and the interior of the hole showed a torn surface on the end grain side as opposed to a smooth cut. Overall the quality of the grinding on the carbide cutting tips and the body of the bit was uneven and poorly finished. My twenty year old hand sharpened steel bits produced better results. For the money I expected more and returned these bits.
2,Vague survey of the literature,"I am referring to the 1991 edition. This is not a textbook and definitely not an introduction- it is a survey of the literature and opaque on content. I cannot judge it as a survey, what I can say is: don't start here."
2,390mg SALT/SODIUM = STILL TOO HIGH,"390mg SODIUM/SALT PER 3.25oz TIN/CAN ""STILL TO HIGH"" Based on some of the canned fish products Ive reviewed ; Herring is ""ABOVE AVERAGE"" Fish Product , so I give it 2 STARS BECAUSE OF THE ""HIGHER SODIUM/SALT"" WHICH ""RUINS/DEGRADES"" THE ""A"" ""ABOVE AVERAGE/QUALITY"" FISH(HERRING)."
3,Crown Prince Kipper Snacks,"They are OK, but not as good as Reese's, whick I can't find hee in Mobile, Alabama."
1,Crown Prince Kipper Snacks...very stinky and hard to open,"Crown Prince Kipper Snacks, 3.25-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24) is not a good product. It doesn't taste very good, it is extremely smelly, and the tab to open (like an old style coke can) frequently breaks...resulting in using a can opener or knife to open. Once that juice splashes in your kitchen (or or your clothes is worse) you have a stench that last for days for a weird-tasting product that wasn't even worth it in the first place.Needless to say, I will never buy it again."
3,Kipper size,"Has anyone noticed in the last 8 months or so, the size of the Kipper fish has gotten smaller, and the quantity of juice in the can has gotten larger (for weight purpose) ? The fish used to cover the whole can, the last few I have opened have quite a bit of air in there.Time to contact Crown Prince and let them know we know and see the difference ? Been eating these things for a while, and there has been a very noticeable difference in the quantity of the contents."
1,You couldn't pay me to read this 'book',"With so many other choices out there, I can't believe that anyone would seriously considered buying, let alone reading, this filth. My 18-month-old daughter has more talent and credibility that this hack, and she doesn't even know her ABC's yet!Finally, with all due respect to the great Ernie Harwell, I start to question his senility when I read his review of Mr. Sharp's rubbish."
1,what a worthless human being,"Drew Sharp represents everything that is bad about sports writers. I live near the detroit area and i make a habit of glancing at Mr. Sharp's column every day. In the past three years that I've been doing this I have never once seen him write anything positive. All he ever does is whine and complain. If one team does something well, he'll switch gears and complain about something else. I have a family member who has sat in the press box at Ford Field a number of times and one thing that stuck out about Mr. Sharp is that he NEVER watches the games. He's too busy telling everyone about how cool he is. Mr. Sharp do your self a favor and write a positive column and tell the rest of the world something we might really be surprised to hear... that you have any talent."
1,My 2 year old is a better writer,"Drew Sharp is as bright as grain of sand. He may be the most hated man in the state of michigan, and this diarrhea for the eyes book he wrote is another shining example on how to wipe and flush.He is a dispickable human and his writing shows proves it."
1,Uninspired and Boring Retread of Common Memes,"Drew Sharp, like many contemporary sports journalists, has made his reputation by following the trend of being the voice of the contrarian. Sharp's content often involves denigrating the local sports franchises, even in the face of success, in order to enrage the passionate fanbases. This of course has the effect of increasing readership, if only for people to confirm their dislike for his content. Unfortunately in today's sports journalism industry, it's better to be read, for whatever the reason, than be respected. His book follows along the style as his daily columns and while numerous other journalists have seen success with this style, Sharp is not even close to the best practioner of it. The book is pedestrian, tepid, and ultimately boring. Enthusiastically NOT RECOMMENDED."
1,A Truly Worthless Human Being,"I cannot tell you anything else except DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! This guy is an embarrassment to not only the city of Detroit, but the entire state of Michigan! This is the same moron who, while writing an article on the Red Wings chances of repeating in 1998, spoke of how Mike Keenan would lead St. Louis past Detroit. Too bad he had been fired by St. Louis the year before! His overall knowledge of sports ranks right behind my daughters hamster's knowledge."
1,What a joke,I have never read a more horrendous book in my life. Where did this guy get his journalism degree?
1,What a joke,"Drew Sharp represents everything that is wrong with dinosaur media. The only goal is to create controversy by making outrageous statements backed up by absolutely zero fact or research.This book is horrendous, his column is horrendous and he is a horrendous human being.Do NOT read this book."
1,waste of time,I made it through about 1/4 of this book and realized it was doing nothing that hadn't been done. Don't waste your money.
1,How many trees died to publish this putrid piece of gasbaggery?,"I read through half this book before I realized that he was being earnest in his attempt at "" serious journalism"". I felt like washing my eyes out with acid to try to regain what I fear is lost forever, my ability to recognize pure garbage."
5,La mejor voz latina del momento,Luego de descubrirlo como cantante de Chichi Peralta y ahora en su nueva carrera como solista esta vez Jandy Feliz nos deleita con su suave voz haciendo un material de excelente calidad.Entre sus temas cabe destacar 'cariñosa' y 'si supieras'.Totalmente recomendable para aquellos amantes de la buena musica centroamericana con mucha percusion y ritmo.
4,Good tips,"The author is respectful of sex and sexual partners. He has gathered info from many sources to provide a wide range of tricks for everyone from the ""average sex"" person, to the truly experimental. Makes me want to have the book by the bed with a pen and mark off the tricks as we try them. I am thankful for a sex book WITHOUT pictures."
2,If you're really not sure what to do,"Many of these ""tricks"" were either stuff I'd already figured out by just creative experimenting, or safe sex tips. If you really draw a blank when trying to think of what to do, this might be helpful. I found the corny titles (almost all 125 were horrid puns) and the amount of time he spends covering his butt (lots) annoying."
5,World-class achievements in clothing & style,"Christian Dior: The Early Years 1947-1957 by Esmeralda de Rethy (daughter of Princess Liliane of Belgium who was one of Christian Dior's very first clients) and fashion historian Jean-Louis Perreau is an incredible, superbly illustrated and informative coffee table book providing a vivid fashion record perfectly capturing the founding of an empire of style in the post-World War II decade. Full-page photographs, some color, some black and white, many nearly half a century old, adorn the pages along with Dior's original sketches and commentary. The text traces the travails, efforts, and world-class achievements in clothing, style, and love of life in this high society treasury. Christian Dior is very highly recommended reading for students of 20th Century fashion history in general, and the influential contributions of Christian Dior in particular."
5,Great product,"I love this powder. It looks good when used both wet and dry. When used with a damp sponge, coverage is sheer and natural. It is ideal for travel because it won't spill. I have bought this twice and will purchase again."
1,Very misleading,"I bought this movie after reading the reviews that it was supposed to be the 1970s anime that I remember seeing as a child. The reviews said that to ignore the cover art, that it does not match the movie.Yes it does. This movie is NOT the anime. The movie I recieved looks EXACTLY like the cover. I am very disappointed. What a waste of money."
2,Crying,"I loved this anime as a kid. I loved the heartbreaking truth of the real story of the little mermaid. I was incredibly thrilled to find this on DVD after years of searching for one that wasn't someones bootleg copy taped from the VHS. Imagine my disappointment to see that like 4 minutes had been chopped from the film.No longer does the sea witch brew the potion before your eyes, no longer does she talk about cutting out Marina's tongue. There is no more sisterly goodbye because you can see breasts. I understand we try to shield our children today, but my goodness, this is a classic how dare we tamper with it!"
3,A great piece of nostalgy... but cut by censure,"In my young time, I've seen this great masterwork of Toei Animation.The full Andersen story, with the original sad end.It had stolen tears and when I see it back now, it keeps its original magic.Too bad that this opus was censored : a lot of scenes are removed. In fact all that show a little piece of nudity. Sorry to tell you censors, but Sirens do not wear t-shirt under water, and young people see more than the scenes you've cut when seeing the tv ads..."
4,The Anime Version,"As all the reviewers have said, this version of ""The Little Mermaid"" is not some cheesy cartoon. This is the 70's anime version that is based more on the original story then the happy Disney version. The mermaid's name is Marina and her dolphin friend is Fritz. It was great to finally find this movie on DVD. However, I had one problem with it. When the movie first came out, there was some nudity, though it was nothing serious. The mermaids are bra-less. However, in this DVD version, some of the movie appears choppy because they have edited out parts of certain scenes. Having watched the movie about 1000 times when I was a kid, I remember certain scenes to be longer. However, they only cut about 5 total minutes out of the movie and it is still the great animated film that I remember. To summarize: Movie - 5 stars, DVD version - 4 stars"
4,Buena calidad de reproduccion,"La calidad de reproduccion es muy similar a la original (version VHS) a pesar de ser DVD. Sin embargo, no tengo conocimiento de alguna version digital (DVD). En resumen, el sonido y el video son buenos.La trama es fiel al cuento de Hans Christian, aunque algunos opinen que el final es cruel, deben recordar que la mayoria de los cuentos de Andersen, asi como de los hermanos Grimm son crueles y llenos de historias de horror. Es evidente que los niños van a necesitar una interpretacion paterna de la trama; desde mi punto de vista es mejor la interpretacion paterna que la interpretacion rosa de Disney."
1,As of 2010 NO LONGER the sad original I remember.,"I purchased this DVD because my sister owns a copy, which she had purchased based on the previous reviews. She bought hers a few years ago and it WAS the original (sad version) from my childhood. I don't know when they changed it, but my copy is the same as what you see on the cover. I tried watching it and couldn't made it through 15 minutes... the script is terrible, the art style is pretty blah, the voice overs are very B-movie in a bad way."
5,"good, sad movie","its a good movie, i saw it when i was like 9 and the ending always made me cry. i still have the videocassette of it but got the dvd to be able to see the move in dvd :)."
4,The version I grew up with...,"The cover is VERY misleading. This is actually the anime version, and the one I grew up watching. There is some editing, probably due to today's censorship, but I would definitely recommend this over the Disney version."
1,Not meant for some gaskets,"This product is not meant for all gaskets, stay away. It caused my car to smoke up, waste of money."
1,stringy,"very stringy and gets everywhere. it also stains everything it touches and did not seal as well as i had hopes, still have oil leak"
4,Why does she deny herself?,"Tula and Rosa are two orphans raised by their priest uncle. Ramiro is a young man who falls for Tula, but she is a tough young woman who refuses him and prompts Ramiro to marry Rosa instead. Rosa is a feeble woman who gives birth to three children before dying. Tula steps in to take care of the children, and then Ramiro asks her again to marry him. Tula refuses one more time, and becomes Aunt Tula. She is the real head of the family, a firm but loving woman. One of the kids, Manuela, adores her and starts becoming a new Aunt Tula. Ramiro, very sad at her refusals, marries the maid and has two more kids. The the maid dies and Ramiro follows. Before he dies, Tula confesses her love for him. Why the hell then didn't she marry him? We are left without a clue: maybe it's because of the stern and restrictive Catholicism of Spain in those times, maybe she's frigid, maybe whatever. But the novel is good and the character is interesting."
5,History of a woman's self-repression,"Tula and Rosa, two orphans, grow together educated by their uncle, a priest. Ramiro, a young admirer of both, cannot choose between them. Tula denies her own desires and pushes Rosa to marry him. When Rosa dies, Ramiro declares his love for his sister-in-law, but Tula keeps on denying herself her sexual and emotional needs and becomes the aunt-mother of Rosa's children. Only when Ramiro is dying she is able to declare her love."
1,horrible edition,"full of errors made when the book was being digitalized. It is full of misspellings; the punctuation is mistyped, making it impossible to understand. Skip this edition; Amazon should take it off the market!"
2,Not really,"Hello:I am sorry that this is not a review but what I would like to know is who is the author or composer of Eddie Santiagos greates hit:""Qué locura enamorarme de ti"", can you help me find out this? We are a finish salsa band and we need to know that so we can pay the copyrights of this song and we can broadcast our demo CD on the radio in Finland.Thank very much for your helpRoberto Urrutia Vasa, Finland"
3,"Hardly Lem's Best, therefore is merely great SF","This is a new book by one of the most important authors in the 20th century, but the above review is too slick to be trusted. Indeed, die-hard Lem fans will be thrilled by a new book and will no doubt enjoy seeing Ijon Tichy again. But this book, though magnificent on speculation and satire, will not be the one to explain to all the non-Lem fans why we Lem fans go bonkers over him. This book is for people with an acquired taste for Lem. If that's not you, don't despair. Try ""The Cyberiad"" or ""Solaris"" (his most famous book) or ""Fiasco""."
2,Neither hemisphere liked this read.,This really isn't my favorite Lem story. I do really like the idea of someone being two different people who have to find a way to communicate when the brain's corpus callosom is cut and therefore thoughts cannot be shared. The idea of putting all of the earth's weapons on the moon and have computers research and improve on them without humans was kind of a stretch of reasoning.
4,Irish beauty,"This novel will appeal to any avid Irish literature enthusiast. Somewhere between Tristram Shandy and Sebastian Dangerfield lies Desmond, our wondering wandering hero who takes up residence in compartment 304D of a train travelling back and forth between Dublin and Dundalk, drinking his way through Europe. As he doesn't know where he is going, he cannot be lost, and the cast of characters he encounters cannot help him. Uncle Melchi, a drunken priest, a beautiful girl on the train, his dentist... What follows is at times hilarious and tragic, but always rolling with verdant beauty.I read an older edition sans the Sorrentino preface."
3,Weird and wacky,"This book claims that measurements of the internal passages of the Great Pyramid spell out history and the future.The author says that aliens built the pyramids and one day they will show man how to build spaceships and colonize other solar systems.(If aliens are so smart, why will they teach man to go to other planets and screw them up like he has done to Earth?)No hard evidence is offered for these fantastic propositions.In one of his earlier books, ""The Gospel of the Stars"", he says that the Age of Aquarius will start in the year 2010AD yet in this book he puts it forward to 2371AD with no explanation for the discrepancy.For reliable information on ancient Egypt one should read people like R.Schwaller de Lubicz and Gerald Massey."
2,Out of this world?????,"This book reads more like a sci fi novel than, a non fiction book! The author's conclusion, is based purely on speculation of forthcomming events, and the whole narrative felt reminiscent of Aurthur C Clark's 2001 series!If you believe in prophesy, and for seeing the future, then this is a book for you!"
5,"Thank you, Lynne Truss!","I am a stickler, as is Lynne Truss. This book made a three-hour (note the hyphen) flight seem too short, although the passengers on either side of me probably thought I was having some sort of fit as I tried (unsuccessfully) to stifle my laughter. The book contains good advice and clear rules, and it's written very well.When Truss quoted Peter Cook and Dudley Moore (twice!), I knew I had found a soulmate.This goes on my grammar shelf, next to Woe is I and The Transitive Vampire. (The Elements of Style has a special place of honor.)"
5,"Review: Eats, Shoots & Leaves",The supplier was very prompt in getting us the book. My wife loved it! The book looked and smelled new. I am a return buyer at Amazon and they have never failed to satisfy us fully. Whether books or Sony computers Amazon will lead you to the best deals from reputable sellers. I recommend you try Amazon.com if you want a safe and reliable purchase on the internet. Fred in Ohio
5,Who knew?,"I never knew that punctuation rules could be so effectively combined with humor! In addition to learning about British usage and some of the common problems they are seeing on the other side of the big puddle, I found this book highly edifying. I was sad when I finished reading it, and plan to read it again and again."
1,"Complaining, not teaching","I was hoping for a guide with which to improve my punctuation. Instead, I endured a psudo-intellectual snob touting her superior brain and whining about the stupidity of everyone else on the planet. The author fails to realize that a display of specialized skill,(a fixation with punctuation) does not denote overall mental superiority. Even if it did, I wouldn't care to spend my time reading poison-tipped sarcasm rather than improving my punctuation skills."
1,don't bother,"The idea is cute and it seems to have ""caught on."" But the books is greatly overrated!! I find her over use of the semicolon and colon extremely annoying. She doesn't mention or distinguish the difference between an M dash or an N dash.I think her book needs an editor!!! Much better books are Lapsing Into A Comma by Bill Walsh or The New Well-Tempered Sentence by Karen Elizabeth Gordon."
2,I enjoyed this light and amusing book ......,"I enjoyed this light and amusing book, despite the fact that it has been overexposed and overrated. I would also recommend ""When Bad Grammar Happens to Good People"", which I recently came across in a bookstore."
4,An absolute must-have for English lovers,"English is often called the window to the world. This book opens that window wider and forces the light in.All the ""punctuation manglers"" I know ought to read it. I have started with myself, and will be sure to spread the word. This book is at the top of my ""gift list"" for this year.Good job, Lynn. I hope the day never comes when Pandas eat, shoot & leave!"
4,Punctuation huh.....,"What can I say about this one? It was a good beach read. Someone is desperate and the price for my book just went up. Reading this one and the other one in april was painful. Of coarse you never saw that, you were only looking at a ""One Eyed Jack"" I have probably already said more than I should about this book. Friends are good, and with the right punctuation you too can become a more effective writer. P.S. having powerful friends does not hurt either."
5,Very good,The book was in excellent condition. I appreciated the fact that it was mailed in a very timely fashion
3,What you're actually getting,"Just to be clear, this CD is a compilation of a multi-part BBC radio program by the same author. It is not an audio transcript of the book. (I bought it to listen to in the car where I can't read the book.) That said, it is very entertaining and a good listen. It is only 1 hour and 9 minutes long. Enjoy it but don't expect the audio book."
3,Misleading,"The writer is showing off. There is no particular wisdom in this book, although it is rather amusing for a quick run-through. As an English teacher, I have encountered some creative punctuation among students, and have also developed definite ideas about how punctuation should be used. There are certainly rules, and if one learns the rules along with the grammar and usage that punctuation supports, there is no problem. Granted, almost no one but diehard purists knows the proper use of the apostrophe, but that shows only that it has been badly taught. Colons and semicolons have their own rules, and can best be conquered by avoidance. We are becoming a world of illiterates, and only the most fastidious of us will preserve the traditions that keep sentences from tumbling off the tracks like a head-on train wreck. This book does not help."
4,A Reader in MO,A funny spin on a boring subject! I wish all my text books had been this witty during my school years. Maybe I would have studied just a little bit more. I'll be keeping this handy at work to use as a reference!
4,Hilariously useful!,"This is a great book for those in your life who are grammatically challenged. It's also a great book for giving youngsters who are preparing for standardized tests, etc. to make them realize that grammar can be fun and funny. Bits of the book get a little heavy to trudge through, but very few such bits. Overall I found it an awesome addition to my library, the kind you can revisit over and over every few months"
2,Rambling drivel,"If you enjoy strong punctuation opinions (not always good ones) interspersed with a few sad examples of bad writing--both the author's and other peoples'--this is a book for you. If you're looking for something dry and wry, keep moving."
3,"Fun for people who have never read a fun grammar book, useful for people who have never read a useful one.","Was it the cute pandas on the cover? I can't imagine how this book became a best seller. There are far more useful grammar books out there. There are far more enjoyable grammar books out there. There are, in fact, a slew of grammar books that are both more useful and more enjoyable than this one.""Eats, Shoots and Leaves"" will teach you little more than that the incorrect usage of apostrophes and quotation marks bugs Lynne Truss. The book is easy to read -- not a bad thing -- and can be a friendly introduction to the world of grammar instruction and the people who care. If you're looking for anything more than that, though, skip this book and look to other authors' works."
2,Puzzled by all the hype...,"Frankly, I'm puzzled over the hype about this book. I have always been annoyed with mistakes in spelling, grammar, and punctuation. But even I had trouble making it through this book. Sure, there were interesting and funny sections. And I even cleared up a few punctuation rules that weren't clear to me before. However, there were parts I found downright boring. It seems like the average person cares less about punctuation than I do, so how did this get on the best-seller list? I am glad I read it, though, because I did learn something. It's also good to know there are people out there who care about punctuation even more than I do!"
4,A Great and Fun Way to Learn Grammar!,"I loved the approach this book took to the English language and the many mistakes made by the people who use it everyday. While not intriguing (it is a grammar book) this book offers an interesting way to correct mistakes that you might be commonly making everyday, or just an interesting read if you like playful puns and jumbled sentences."
3,Not that great,"Fun? Yes but alas, this book will not rock your world. It's simply not that earthshaking."
4,It's only punctuation,"This book manages to give some good advice (tailored to a British audience -- and why not?) without being stuffy about it, which is more than can be said for some of the reader reviews. The doctor who teaches editing at UC Berkeley needs to get a sense of perspective. It's only punctuation, and the U.S. is only one of the world's several English-speaking countries. Matters of grammar and editorial style seem to bring out the worst in many people -- but not, fortunately, in Lynne Truss."
2,Shoot It!,"We may all agree that punctuation, counts. After all, even the little hyphen makes a world of difference. Take as an example ""extra-marital sex"" vs. ""extra marital sex."" That's a big difference if ever I heard one!This book, however, erodes its claim to the importance of the rules by letting too many errors slip by. Where were the copy editors? Of course, it is written for the British and the British have differences in those rules.(North Americans say ""third"" rather than ""thirdly"" and Americans may not place a semicolin in the salutation of a business letter, for example.)That notwithstanding, this book should have been proofed to perfection since its theme is ""zero tolorance"" for such things. My favorite error is ""...newspapers who insist on precision..."" found on page 35. And by the time you get to page 35, there are a dozen others.Best to wait for the revised edition."
2,Just a rant piece - not very helpful,"I bought this book hoping it would be informative and maybe a little humorous, judging from the title, but it turned out to just be a big rant about the stupid people the author has encountered and the grammatical mistakes they make in writing. A much better approach to tackling grammar with a side of humor can be found in the two hilarious and information-packed volumes by Bill Walsh, ""Lapsing Into a Comma"" and ""The Elephants of Style."" If anyone deserves to be on a bestseller list for a cool book on grammar, it's Bill."
5,Read it first in London,"I read the British version of this book first, and I have to say, it's funnier in its ""original language."" I never thought a book on punctuation would be funny, but after reading an excerpt in a British newspaper, I made a special trip out to buy it. I was laughing out loud the whole way home while reading it on the plane.I suppose the book is not funny if you don't think there's anything wrong with misplaced punctuation, but if you do, this book is a treat!"
4,Entertaining and Enlightening,"While reading this book I learned that telling friends that one is reading a book on punctuation results in puzzled looks. Nonetheless, I found this book to be both a helpful refresher course in correct pronunciation and a highly entertaining and enlightening read. Looking at other reviews, it is evident that some people do not understand or appreciate British humor. I found that I could not read it in public without embarrassing myself laughing out loud. While providing such comic relief, Truss reviews the history of various punctuation marks, demonstrates proper usage, and makes a compelling case for the importance of correct pronunciation in this unfortunate age of e-mail communications -- not to mention online book reviews."
4,Amusing,"If you've ever been severely irritated by the blatant grammatical errors on sign and billboards, in magazines and even on television, you'll love this book. It's good to know I'm not the only one. The examples of bad grammar will make you laugh out loud. If you agree that internet communications are making horrendous grammar even more acceptable, this book is definitely for you.I was almost too intimidated to write this review, since everyone reading it will be scrutinizing my grammar!"
4,This book changed the way that I write,"I enjoyed this book, and came away with an increased awareness of the way that I write in everyday situations. I find myself catching punctuation errors more often, even (especially!) in the notes coming home from school. While this is not a primer on puctuation (nor is it, I believe, intended to be), it is useful as a treatise on the importance of our communication in whatever form it may take. Even if it is an online review."
5,Fabulous,"I am having a very hard time convincing my friends and colleagues that this book is worth reading; however, it truly is a fabulous book. Although I am not as obsessed with punctuation as Ms. Truss, I do appreciate her wonderful sense of humor and her belief that written English should, and certainly can be, expressed in a way that it makes sense to any reader.This book has the potential to be very valuable to people in all areas of life. I highly recommend Eats Shoots & Leaves."
4,Making punctuation fun,"No, it's not an authoritative style book, though it does set out some well thought-out guidelines on punctuation. And no, it's not a comprehensive grammar text. Syntax mavins aren't likely to learn anything new. It is, however, a delightfully witty, highly readable survey of a traditionally deadly dull subject. Here's a fun, brief analysis that is certain to be informative and useful to the average reader and writer. If you think apostrophes and commas are nothing to laugh about, you're in for a surprise."
5,"Good, entertaining survey","Lynne Truss has got it absolutely right with this witty and insightful look at the use and misuse of punctuation.Too often, people defend the ghastly misuses of, say, apostrophes these days with the assertion that languages evolve. Indeed they do, but that is no excuse for the kind of sloppiness that renders the language incomprehensible at times. That's not evolution, it's degradation.Lynne Truss shows us why punctuation matters as a tool in the written language. I'd recommend this book both as a good read and as a concise reference work. It deals, of course, with British English. Maybe one day someone will produce a similar work on American English, or a comparative overview. Now that really would be worth reading."
1,"""Eats, Shoots & Leaves""","I bought this book for my husband for Christmas. His comments below:I was only able to get to page 55, since I was totally bored with the content. The point on the misuse of the apostrophe, with examples, could have been made in two pages. Additional belaboring (or belabouring, if preferable) this point was not instructive. I have no interest in dealing with the next chapter on the comma, since the title of the book, along with the illustration, says it all.S. David Weaver"
4,The content is engaging,"It's a fun read, with some educational value to it. As long as you choose to have fun with the book, you will be glad you picked it up."
5,Replies and Whispers,"I had no idea what the fuss was all about regarding the popularity of this little romp through the history and usage of punctuation until I learned that the author was a witty British humourist, making the read all the more entertaining. Her light-hearted, and informative book is filled with answers to questions I had regarding punctuation usage. I am sure Ms. Truss will have no problem stocking her larder with ""Starburst (formerly Opal Fruits)"" due to the sales of this little tome. It is one I would pass on with pleasure to friends who love the English language whether it be Americanized or the British version."
1,Misleading and not funny,"For Americans, _Eats, Shoots and Leaves_ has a serious, fundamental flaw: it models the English style of punctuation, which differs in a number of ways from the American style as exemplified in the Chicago Manual of Style. Those who follow Ms. Truss's teaching will, perhaps unknowingly, violate American rules of grammar, punctuation, and style. In addition, the book is not systematically arranged or complete, so it cannot reliably be used as a reference. Many of the set-in examples are purposely wrong, so that, by contrast with CMS, a reader cannot look to the examples for guidance. In my opinion, the author's attempted humor falls short, too. Karen Elizabeth Gordon's _The New Well-Tempered Sentence: A Punctuation Handbook for the Innocent, the Eager, and the Doomed_ is funnier, better organized, and more complete. CMS is, for the most part, the definitive reference."
1,forgetaboutit!!,"sorry, in this day and time, it's rather funny people are buying a book and pushing how great it is, when they do not know what is what, eh? Great for homeschooling? No, US homeschooling. Great for publishing? HUN? Don't think so. I know friends that are British and Canadian that write. They keep their WORD set to US spellchecker or their editors would scream.The best teachers I had in school were kind. A mad woman dashing about insulting poor shopkeepers (again with a different language maybe?) may make the writer feel superior, but it's disheartening that people would salute her for this lack of compassion and understanding for her fellow man.Some misses the big picture...no take that back, she get the BIG Bank Balance picture, while laughing at all of us."
1,P T Barnum strikes again,"How easy it seems to be to fool people, with a book heavily hyped, about British punctuation and filled with errors and inconsistencies. Sort of amusing, but not very, and very, very wrong too much of the time. Kudos to the PR machine that created this - I only wish it had a sound basis in fact. Look to style guides, to Bill Walsh (The Elephants of Style), to Barbara Wallraff (Your Own Words), to the older Fowlers, to the AP Style Guide, the New York Times Style Guide. Save your money on this one - or give it to your favorite charity."
1,Pedantic,"Yes, I know this is not a ""grammar"" book, but at least the chapters or paragraphs should have logical flow. Instead, not only were the sections set in a non-linear way (the line of thoughts were jumping around), moreover, I found the book to be colloquial and pedantic.To me, it's supposed to talk about punctuation, hence the chapters should have clearer headings as such. Within a chapter, the author would suddenly jump off at a tangent to discuss about spellings. And sometimes, the tone would lapse into a chit-chat manner.If this was supposed to ""help"" people improve their punctuation, spelling, grammar, whatever (sic), then I believe the style of the whole book should be consistent. I would give this 2.5 stars, but since there are no half-star in Amazon ratings, I gave it ***."
2,:{,"The book has all charm of political talk show radio, those festivals of self congratulation offering smug warmth to those of us ever so much smarter than the other guy. It gets pretty thin pretty quick. Ms Truss suggests that punctuation exists to make clear one meaning over alternative errors of thought. She then proceeds to display her insights with ever so many examples of typographic or educational errors. It's not a bad thought, but it gets less funny the longer it goes on. And for a small book it seems to go on long. On the way she loses any connection to the early, simple truth, and the book becomes a simple parade of her superiority to traffic signs, cartoons, fourteen year-old girls, and Shakespeare. And it's not a bad parade; she has a firm grammatical grasp and offers many truly engaging bits of punctual history. But finally I wish I had heeded my unease at buying any book equal in size to those wondering where went the cheese."
5,"Funny, even if you are not a Panda Bear","This book made me laugh, it made me think, and at times it made me sad. I didn't buy this book as a style guide and I don't think that writing one was the author's primary intention. Truss felt the need to vent regarding the current epidemic of punctuation misuse, and I had several giggles as I vented along with her. Truss allows that some punctuation issues aren't easy to agree on but she also points out that some rules are so simple (think it's vs. its) that there is no excuse for the mistakes we see almost daily. I don't think that a ""non-stickler"" would appreciate Truss's humor. However, if you've ever wanted to pull out a red pen and add or delete a comma in public, run--don't walk--to your nearest bookstore and buy this book."
2,"The author of E,S & L shoots herself in the foot","A classic example of book overhype. Ms. Truss may be a fine person and experienced writer but she desperately needs a much stronger editor, as this so-called British bestseller is wildly overwritten, hopelessly redundant, decidedly unhumorous after the first few pages, and generally not very illuminating to those of us who also abhor poor punctuation and grammar. Absolutely not worth the $17.50 it commands. Sorry, Lynne."
1,Commits the cardinal sin of books on usage,"In ""Eats, Shoots & Leaves,"" Lynne Truss does what a writer of a book on ""correct"" usage should never do--she commits the very errors she rails against. A book like this should always be copyedited and proofread to the highest degree, and here the publishers have failed. As the ""New Yorker"" says, ""About half the semicolons in the...book are either unnecessary or ungrammatical, and the comma is deployed as the mood strikes."" Beyond this, incorrect statements of fact are made. To top it off, a new edition wasn't prepared for the American market, which seems completely bizarre to me given the many differences between American and British styles of punctuation.People who are genuinely interested in English usage can do so much better than this book. It is a shame that it has done so well when greater works have remained relatively unknown."
5,Essential,"A joyous call-to-arms for everyone who reveres the English language and takes pleasure in the intricacies of which it is capable. The author moves right along, taking potshots left and right at confused punctuation while maintaining the interest of newbies and professionals alike.I could take issue with some of Truss' preferences (such as leaving the hyphen out of ""Zero-Tolerance Approach"") but most of those can be laid to her unabashed British provenance, which she acknowledges most of the time."
2,"""Why don't you just tell me...""","This book was recommended to me for my bad grammar, but it didn't do much to help. My problem with this book is that after you read it, you feel like a third-grader. I'd prefer less opinion and more instruction ,but that's not the case in this book. The author wants you to know her opinion but offers little instruction. If you want to read a rant on grammar then this is the book for you, but if you want a black-and-white approach with examples ( instead of someone repeatedly telling you how easy it all is)don't even think about using this book as a reference."
5,Funniest Text Book I Ever Read,"To say Lynne Truss has a way with words is an understatement. Her book is the most enjoyable formal education one can have.I have been very careful about punctuation all my writing life and thought I was doing a great job of it, but Lynne showedme I was only doing slightly better than good job. I like knowing that what I write is correctly punctuated. It's a matter of pride."
4,Excellent Punctuation Refresher,"Eats, Shoots & Leaves does a great job of illustrating how bad punctuation can change the meaning of what we write and read. Ms. Truss goes into great detail laying out the basic rules of punctuation and give examples of how punctuation is used incorrectly in everyday life. As part of my job as an Army Officer, I spend countless hours correcting memos and papers. I highlighted several sections of this book that I will share with my subordinates and peers, in an attempt to improve their writing skills. The only reason I did not give it five stars is that the author came off as pretentious. Once I got past past the tone, I found this an enjoyable book. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in improving their punctuation skills and refreshing what they learned (or didn't learn) in grammar school."
3,How About That Old English Genitive Singular?,"The bit that stuck out like a sore thumb was her lack of research on the history of the apostrophe, specifically when it indicates possession. Jessica from Illinois gets it right: the 's is most likely the remnant of the Old English genitive singular ending for strong nouns -""es"". Didn't Ms. Truss talk to any English professors or linguistics scholars? How about the web?(...)With that aside, it was still entertaining and informative. I'm still rooting for the Oxford comma, as she calls it."
5,Funniest book I've ever read,"This is, hands down, the funniest book I've ever read. I would never have guessed that a book on grammar would make me laugh out loud until my sides hurt. Lynne Truss is absolutely brilliant."
2,"Zzzzzzz.... (Or should it be spelled, ""Z-z-z-z-z-z""?)","""Eats, Shoots & Leaves"" may sound like the condensed plot of a modern Hollywood action movie, but it's really about punctuation--as in, the incorrect use thereof. Unfortunately, author Lynne Truss is no humorist; she tries to milk this single theme for all it's worth, but all she manages is tedious repetition in the manner of a Benny Hill marathon. Ms. Truss would like to punish punctuation abusers, we learn on the first page. And on the second. And on the third. And on the...."
3,The Title is the Best Thing,It's a great title. But no one should be this concerned with grammar. It is more important to write in a clear way and the title depends more on punctutaion that most other writing.
2,blah,i borrowed this book and read the first few chapters. it was really boring. some bits were funny i guess but overall is was blah. i would not reccomend reading it.
2,step up for a rip off?,"This is the ""Emperor's Clothes"" in action. Recall that old fable about the Emperor getting new ""clothes"", which were actually nothing, but no one dared tell him he was running around in his birthday suit? This book and its power to aid anyone is made fo the same cloth as those imaginary clothes. Nudge, nudge, wink, wink...Yanks, they are having one on you.If they really wanted to present a good work that actually helped, they could not take time to edit it for USA usage?Nope, they said, ""Hey, the Yanks won't know the difference....""Shame on the publisher for this farce, shame on Amazon for going along with it."
2,"If You are Going To correct, Be Correct","It is ""so American"" that this book, a punctuation primer of sorts, is a bestseller. It is filled with punctuation errors. I was an English major, and I'm certainly not an ""expert"", but the book is packed with just the type of errors she ""objects"" to. They aren't hard to find. To list them would take several tedious pages. I think America likes this book because it wants to believe that ""educated"" Americans are horrified by the sloppy emails,etc. that everybody sends now. ""These young people and their rap music and what not, they are destroying our culture."" American culture is always destroying itself; that's just what it does. The people who buy this book are doing a good job themselves."
2,"Truss, the cranky comma cop, or...Truss the cranky comma, cop, or....Truss the cranky comma cop.","As the little girl once said in her first book review: ""This book told me a lot more than I wanted to know about asparagus."" Or perhaps it was a little boy? Hell, it could have been the teacher. I don't know. All I know is that like the first spotlight reviewer I found Ms. Truss's attempts at humor (humour) shrill, contrived, and bloody irritating. At the same time I learned a couple of things about commas I didn't know before, had a few other things verified, and enjoyed a few of her examples meant to show how important punctuation is to communication. So there. I look forward to her next ""hilarious"" book on those little circles teenage girls use to dot their i's. (Wouldn't you know...I haven't a clue how to use my comma in i's. Calling Miss Truss!)"
2,I REALLY wanted this to be great. I really did.,"I picked this book up at book stores and put it down at least 6 times since it came out. I just was NOT going to pay $20 for such a thin book. I recently received a $150 Amazon gift card and figured I'd finally buy this book. I even paid less than $13 for it!!! That was $12.94 I wish I had back. ""Laugh out loud funny?""; Hardly. I usually ""get"" British humor. I either didn't ""get"" any of the humor or it just wasn't there to ""get"". If I had it to do all over, I would have borrowed it from the library."
4,A Friendly Read,"I picked this book up after seeing the book shoot up the best seller list. I figured if a book on punctuation could be a number one best seller, then I should probably give it a read; and I am happy to report that I was not disappointed.The author does a great job of writing about punctuation and explaining why certain things (like the missing comma in Two Weeks Notice) drive her batty. Batty to the point of advocating those legions of punctuation devotees get themselves sets of commas and apostrophes, and enter into the world to rid it of all the bad grammar that is taking place out there.For anyone who has been annoyed to see things spelt incorrectly or witnessed first hand the poor use of grammar that gets put on street signs and advertisement, this book is definitely up your alley. And for those of us, like me, who just want a good comical read this book is definitely a must have too."
4,FUN,This book is such fun! You can actually hear the British sense of humor as you read. Major problem: to whom to lend it now that I'm finished. Most people don't read ANY books let alone non-fiction books like this. Perhaps the English teacher at school?
2,Get out your red pen.,"Lynne Truss spends an interminable amount of the reader's time grousing about misplaced apostrophes, but scattered throughout her book are misplaced quote marks, one of my pet peeves. I had to tie my hand behind my back to keep from transposing them with a pencil. Why didn't the publisher also produce a book for American readers? I understand the book has sold well, so it couldn't have been for monetary reasons.Maybe it's sort of a snobby thing like Alex Trebek's penchant for misplaced quote marks in the Jeopardy answers. People used to write to him about it; he made it very clear to his audience that he wasn't changing them. Apparently, people have given up because he doesn't mention it anymore.For a superb critique of this book, read the one that appeared in the New Yorker. I did, and I learned more about punctuation than Lynne Truss knows."
5,"Is it me - I mean, ""I"", about whom she speaks...","Ah, geez, I loved it. If you can't identify with the following quote (and find the humor in it), don't torment yourself by reading this book. ""If [this] satanic sprinkling of redundant apostrophes causes no little gasp of horror or quickening of the pulse, you should probably put down this book at once."" So, of course I loved it. In the first few lines of the Introduction, she hit upon one of my pet peeves - the idiotic tendency of 'some people' to create plurals by adding an apostrophe-s.My punctuation instincts are pretty good already, but did I learn anything? Absolutely! And I laughed all the while."
5,The best book ever!,"As a self-professed grammar nerd, I couldn't wait to read this and Lynn didn't disappoint! I've noticed the same problems with signs, newspapers and what passes as language now. She's funny, witty and has the same superiority I have because I know how to speak and write correctly!!!!Her next book should be about adjectives and adverbs- how many times do I have to say it ""you can't do anything good!!!"""
3,Now Just a Cotton-Pickin' Minute...,"Eats, Shoots $ Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation.Hmm...shouldn't there be a hyphen between ""Zero"" and ""Tolerance"" since ""Zero"" modifies ""Tolerance"" in the attributive position?"
1,Better to light a candle than curse the darkness,"As the old saying goes, it's better to light a candle than curse the darkness. A little cursing is actually OK, but all Lynne Truss does is sit on the ground and cuss, and she never does light any candles. This book is just endless complaining; there is hardly any actual guidance on punctuation. Moreover, even the American edition takes no notice of American usage, except to mention its existence in passing. Truss's book deals exclusively with the British rules, which are rather different from ours, so the book is worthless for Americans. Finally, she had the extremely poor taste to state that the worst thing (for her, apparently) about September 11 was the misuse of the word ""enormity"" in the media. (Apart from the moral horror of such a statement, the media did in fact use the word correctly in that context, for once.)"
1,Horrifically purple prose and very little about punctuation!,"Some of the worst writing I've ever read. And I read a couple of books a month (and have written a variety of materials over the past three decades and develop an eye twitch at the sight of misplaced commas and such). Ms. Truss' main problem is not that she writes in a more convoluted style than Shakespeare, nor is it that she is a stereotypically wordy Limey. It's that it takes her so long to get to a point (and her points are frequently in conflict with the American language so as to render them dangerous) that -- well -- let's put it this way: The entire book is 204 pages long. The introduction ends on page 34! The fact is, I have yet to discover a point to this book. Lovers of punctuation are better off reading the Chicago Manual of Style."
3,Mr. Buxton's Hubris,"In the future you might want to check your mistakes before talking about another's hubris. Though you may presume ""oral"" has to do with hearing, the last time I checked, it has to do with your mouth, which you should keep closed, acording to your post, unless you have checked all your sources."
2,"Dorothy Parker She Ain't, Er, ISN'T","A ninth-grade English schoolmarm might slap her plaid-clad knee and cackle with glee at this book's contents but the rest of us will probably have had enough of Ms. Truss' one-joke inside humor by the bottom of page seven. If you suffer through her lessons in punctuation, you can, if you're so inclined, learn a few things. (I guess.) Goodness knows modern America is none too literate and Lynne Truss' effort at raising the national consciousness about the proper use of the comma helps.Would possibly have been better without the attempts at mirth."
1,Kindle reader is unfriendly with this book,The book could be entertaining and educational in a regular paper printed format. This is the type of book that you need to be able to flip back and forth for reference which is most difficult with the Kindle.
3,Grammar Police,"I did like reading about grammar. I love grammar. I love punctuation and I love the English language. As a teacher, I found it entertaining and informative in non-structured way. However, I do not like it when a writer states something like a joke or a particular way of punctuating a sentence and then goes on to explain the whole thing, as though you are a bit daft and would not understand without her interpretation.The book is a great idea but I began to skim the book about a third of the way through. You might as well..."
4,For all the Punctuation Facists,"This book, will remind all the grammatical, and punctuation oafs; that good puntuation is as necessary as fresh air!It is recommended only for the stout hearted.Lynne's, take-no-prisoners style, is only for the reading kind; and not the Macdonalds, TV and computers kind.If you object to serious punctation; don't buy this book. You'll get a bloody good ear bashing; and come away wounded if you do.Fabulous!"
2,"Eats, Reads and Leaves","I really wanted to like this book! In fact, I was even tempted to pay full retail based on the subject and reviews. I didn't like it, nor did I pay full retail. I found it confusing and tiresome. I love to read ""Elements of Style"" (Wm. Strunk)and ""Chicago Manual of Style"" and similar books just for fun. ""Elements of Style"" may have been what I was hoping for, hence the disappointment. The mix of yes-no-do-don't was confusing, and as a language/word lover, I learned nothing new or useful.I don't see what the fuss is about."
4,Reference tool,Writer/author makes it plain and easy to follow along with the examples offered in the book. Definitely a good reference tool for writers/literates.
2,A Good Subject Poorly Covered,"Eats, Shoots, and Leaves by Lynne Truss is often longer than necessary, occasionally insightful, and usually snarky. Although I hoped for a useful and entertaining grammar guide, I found instead two hundred pages of complaints about modern usage peppered with references to grammarians with whom the author would like to sleep. I was able to trudge through the book in its entirety only due to its brevity and simplistic style. Not worth reading again or even reading once."
4,Strike one blow for literacy!,The author deserves the thanks of the general publicfor temporarily stalling the dumbing down of contemporarywriting. She does is with just the right degree of snobappeal.Lamar Nesbit
2,Over-rated and under-edited,"The popularity of this book is a testament to the madness of crowds. It would be flattery to say that it is merely tedious. It is repetitive (one or two weak examples come up again and again) and is poorly edited (many paragraphs contain several unrelated ideas).This book is no substitute for learning how to write well. Indeed, although the author may know her punctuation (or at least she knows what she likes) the book is unreadable. The following sentence is an exemplar of what passes for prose in this book: ""To me a subordinate clause will for ever (sic) be (since I heard the actor Martin Jarvis describe it thus) one of Santa's little helpers."" Eh?This is the sort of book that someone pretentious is likely to give you as a gift. Plan to ""re-gift"" it to someone you don't like."
1,"Trying to be funny,...but not","This is one I would not have bought,....glad it was given to me so I could give it back."
2,"A Rant. Witty, but a rant nevertheless.","Not until page 33 of the 34-page introduction - which comprises approximately 1/6 of the book - does the author reveal that ""this book doesn't instruct about punctuation."" Instead, it ""gives [the reader] permission to love punctuation.""If you actually want to learn how to properly punctuate American English - or any English at all - then find a different book. If you like to ridicule people for not knowing how to punctuate then this is the book for you. This book reminds me of a bad slasher film. People often go see these films for no other reason than to feel superior to the doomed victims who run screaming into the night, yet stop and look behind them just long enough for their assailant to catch them. ""Eats, Shoots and Leaves"" allows its readers to feel superior by thinking, ""I would never make a stupid mistake like that. My goodness, how ignorant the rest of the world is compared to me and my fellow punctuation sticklers."""
2,Huh? Is that funny?,"Well, perhaps the author is right about most of us. We just don't care enough about the misuse and abuse of our punctuation. I bought this book based on a recommendation of a relative. But not even halfway through the book, I find her argument for correct usage of punctuation quite tedious and repetitive; her passion and intensity for the subject, approaching freakishness. Maybe that's her humor. I don't know. All I know is that it was funny for about 10 pages... then she totally lost me. I have better use of my time reading something else a bit more compelling, and actually funny."
4,Permission to Love,"Truss warns readers that it is reviews just like these that lead to the proliferatioin of mispunctuation.This book is an enjoyable read for anyone who has ever been confused over just where to place a comma, or the proper use of the semicolon. Truss offers up interesting tales of punctuation history with a sense of glee that is almost catching.Grammar snobs may turn their noses up at this Bestseller, but for the generally confused masses, it at least sparks the debate, which is what I suspect Ms Truss wants more than anything - to see puncuatioin live on indefinitely."
4,Funny and informative.,"I thought this book was funny but only to people who are ""into"" punctuation and the English language. It is the English language, not the American language, so there are some things that do not apply."
5,Another Inner Stickler,"Lynne Truss's delightful, funny, truthful book on punctuation in English is a joy. Knowing myself for a pedant, I had thought my obsession with the misplaced apostrophe and other printed sins was an isolated case! Reading ""Eats, Shoots and Leaves ..."" I now find that zero tolerance is a norm with others, possibly even many others. How wonderful to find one has an Inner Stickler - and all is well!"
3,Not: very readable,There's been too much hype. The book is very short with a very long prologue and yet is still difficult to read. The most I've gotten from it is that punctuation is important and that there are some humorous examples of how adding or omitting punctuation marks can have dramatic effects on meaning.
3,"mellifluous, but vapid","Miss Truss has a pleasant, entertaining writing style, but this book doesn't have much information on grammar. It only addresses a few grammatical subjects (e.g., apostrophes, commas, and semi-colons). The text is at times simply wrong and often, muddled. For example, in the book, periods are placed outside quotation marks; periods (and commmas) are ALWAYS placed inside quotation marks. Addtionally, her explanation of when to use a semi-colon is long winded and murky. (A clear and concise explanation is that a semi-colon is used between two related independent clauses.)"
4,Grammar Can Be Fun!,"I really liked this book. It was humorous and informative at the same time. I learned quite a bit and I laughed a lot. She has a great sense of humor--even if the jabs are mostly directed at the grammatically challenged. If you enjoy learning grammar and you'd like it to be fun, give this book a shot."
3,"Look, a comma splice on page 28! How ironic.","Am I the only one in all of the thousands who have read this book that noticed the terrible comma splice on page 28? ""Sticklers unite, you have nothing to lose but your sense of proportion, and arguably you didn't have a lot of that to begin with."" The first comma should be a period or a semicolon.Before even completing the first chapter, Truss makes a bald-faced grammatical mistake while arrogantly pointing out those of other people. Har har."
5,Great funny little book on grammar and word usage,I really can' describe this book. It is full of funny ways people phrase things and their sometimes hilarious use of punctuation.
2,Light weight and insufferably precious,I just couldn't stand the author's self conscious preciousness and the undertone of self congratulation that seem to fill every page. There really isn't that much content in this book. If you stripped away all the fluff you would be left with the equivalent of a a few online articles about punnctuation. I really can't understand the appeal of this book. I had to give up halfway through
3,Sort of OK,I was not really sure about this book and found it a bit of a rollercoaster. Funny but also dull at times. Only read it if you've nothing else to do
4,"An error in Eats, Shoots? Impossible!","Well, no, it ain't all that enlightening when it comes to teaching the rules of punctuation--you knows 'em by now or you doesn't--but it is pretty funny--hilarous, in spots--in Truss's rants about this and that example of iggerance or stoopidity in our pop culture. And she is to be commended for refraining from shooting fish in a barrel: there's not a single reference to the lapidary prose issuing daily from the mouths of POTUS.It seems impertinent to play Gotcha! with this paean to precision, but there persists, even in the 15th printing of Gotham's American edition, a pretty obvious error on page 124. Evelyn Waugh certainly knew that attachés work not in legislations, but in legations. Those who work at all, of course...Gotham won't accept e-mails, and I lost my spray can somewhere in the subway, so I am obliged to out them in this tawdry and commercial space. To err is human; to forgive, unsatisfying."
4,"Hilarious, finally, I can come out of the closet...","I confess to walking into the Levi's Strauss store on union square (here in SF) and railing on the ""greeter"" about the sign that said ""All tee's on sale"" And this was produced by an advertising agency!! Of course, the teenage greeter looked perplexed and called me ""ma'am"" so I knew nothing would come of it. But it did make me feel better. Pick up this book, it is great."
5,One Laugh After Another,"I have never laughed more (out loud, with regularity) than while reading this gem. As a punctuation freak, I identified with all of the author's points, and her writing style is very engaging. I plan to buy this book as a gift for fellow punctuation freaks. It's a great book to throw in your purse and read in bits and pieces; just be careful not to read it at the funeral parlor."
3,"Drags a little at times, but overall interesting book","The concept of the book is interesting. It is not the most exciting book to read, but if you are like the author, a stickler, it is interesting and it has its amusing moments. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates grammar."
2,best thing about it is the title...,"I'm a bit of a grammar geek, and I found this book dull, repetitive, and not terribly enlightening. And for American readers, the British-style punctuation is irrelevant at best. I didn't even bother to finish it. Number ten in Amazon overall book sales? Why?"
3,Error in title,"""The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation"" should be ""The Zero-Tolerance Approach to Punctuation."""
4,Fun book,"I thought this was a fun book, although I'm not sure that I agree with all of the author's points. Clearly, she cares a great deal about grammar in a way that the rest of us might not. Still, it was quite entertaining. I definitely recommend it for anyone who enjoys word (crossword puzzlers, Scrabble players, or just readers)."
1,Save money. Go to Barnes & Noble and read the end flaps.,"Did you ever see a movie trailer with hilarious scenes then go to the movies to find out you've already seen the best parts? Read the end flaps of this book and quickly put it back on the shelf. Not only is the book not funny... it's not even entertaining. Everything in the book was covered in 7th and 8th grade English classes!Save your money. Go to your local bookstore, read the end flaps, have a chuckle or two and put it back on the shelf. Buy a softcover version of a classic you've always meant to read."
1,I hate this book....,"I'm the type of person who will point out misspellings or misusages of grammar. My friends are always irritated with me because of my oddity. This book...Dear God! Eats, Shoots & Leaves is quite possibly the worst book I've ever read. After I read House On Mango Street, I thought that surely there wasn't a book written worse than that. I stand corrected. Lynn Truss (the author) is obsessive and needs a cat or something. She's very repetetive in writing the book. She constantly repeats what she has previously said because THERE ISN'T THAT MUCH TO WRITE ABOUT A COMMA!!!! God help me. Unless you are required to read this book, as I was for AP English, I highly recommend you do not read this book. It is quite possible you will literally be bored to tears. Save your money. Save your time. Read Shakespeare."
3,THIS WAS A ONE DISC AFFAIR. IT WAS DONE IN DROLL ENGLISH HUMOR ANDI THINK WOULD CHARM AN ENGLISH TEACHER,THIS WAS MADE UP FROM AN ENGLISH RADIO SERIES THAT HAD SOME INTERESTING HISTORY AND MUCH ANALYSES OF GRAMMAR AND PUNCTUATION.LIKE MOVIE TRAILERS THE FUNNIEST LINE IS THE TITLE.IT WAS INTERESTING AND FAINTLY AMUSING BUT MY TASTE IS LESS SUBTLE AND SUBDUED.
3,Whoops!,It's a pity a sensational book on punctuation sports a punctuation error in the title on the cover!
2,It's OK,"I think if I found her humor funny then I would appreciate the book better. She does speak the truth, I would prefer it without so many attempts at humor. Then again, the subject matter probably needs humor otherwise you would fall asleep."
2,Zero tolerance dictates you shouldn't tolerate this book,"Reviewing ""Eats, Shoots, & Leaves"" in The New Yorker, one of the world's most carefully edited literary magazines, Louis Menand notes that the first punctuation error in this book ""appears in the dedication, where a nonrestrictive clause is not preceded by a comma. It is a wild ride downhill from there."" The rest of Menand's article proceeds to tear Lynee Truss a new one, pointing out dozens of unforgivable grammar mistakes. To top it all off, Gotham Books chose not to make any changes to the American edition of this British book. We all know that British English is a horse of a different colour and follows slightly different ""rules"". It sure takes guts for a book like this to advocate the intolerance of grammar gaffes."
2,"Overrated, I'm sorry to say","This book had some entertainment value, but it just wasn't that good. I had heard so many good things about the book that I was looking forward to reading it. However, this appears to be a case of everyone being afraid to admit they didn't like it - because it's supposed to be a bit intellectual. Well, call me ignorant (you wouldn't be the first), but it gets old quick. If you want something entertaining in this genre, try a Bill Bryson book.And a note to the author - it's Two Weeks Notice (not Two Week's Notice) because Two Weeks is describing Notice, not a possessive. It's Sandra's Two Weeks Notice."
2,Will Be Clogging the Used Book Stalls in a Matter of Weeks.,"Yes, the title is incorrectly punctuated. I wouldn't make a big deal of it except for the fact that this is precisely the sort of thing this book makes a big deal of, page after page.This might have made a nice little article in something like _Harper's_ or the British equivalent, but a book-length treatment of this subject is a bit tiresome.Astonishingly, Truss seems to have no idea where the possessive "" 's "" comes from, citing only the fallacious ""his"" theory and then dropping the subject altogether. The "" 's "" comes from the vanished genitive case, Toots.Those who defend the book on the grounds that the humor is so quintessentially British that it defies American grasp are talking nonsense. It's not even the sort of pedantic, nerdy humor that would be funny only to librarians who can't get laid, since I AM such a librarian.I laughed much more at Alex Ainley's review below (q.v. sub) than anything in this book."
5,Eats shoots - & leaves!,Great condition - surprised how good it was considering the price tag. Looks barely read.
4,Pretty good,This book was helpful. Only drawback is that it is written in novel form so it is difficult to use as a reference.
3,"Some clever points, but dull.","Some of the examples Truss shares in this book are enjoyable to read, but I don't find reading grammar primers to be all that enjoyable. The only salvation Truss has in this writing is the last chapter that describes the impact of ""webspeak"" on the English language."
3,A mostly overdramatic punctuation companion,"Perhaps a book best enjoyed by English majors, writers, and general punctuation loonies. This manifesto otherwise provides ammunition for the `get a life and just use grammar check' crowd. Truss is quite militant in both her indictment of and attack plan against bad punctuation; she WILL NOT stand the assault of comma misuse any longer. Rectification includes: white out, felt markers, and a gun. So it's easy to see why she sometimes feels the Sisyphus of the punctuation realm and at least she acknowledges her neurosis. This short exercise primarily serves as her steam vent via humorous anecdotes and some punctuation genealogy with general pointers (otherwise found in your beloved Strunk and White or MLA Handbook) on commas, apostrophes, parentheses, periods, dashes, and my beloved semicolon."
4,Perfect for grammar nerds!,This book was funny and informative. I recommend it to all English teachers and grammar nerds. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the humor is redundant so I found myself rolling my eyes a bit by the end.
4,"Eats, Shoots, and Leaves","Pretty good book. Helpful in its area of punctuation. Recommend it to those English strugglers.Eats, Shoots & Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation"
5,Love it!,You like punctuation and detail? Then this is the book for you. It doesn't matter if you are a native English speaker or not. The book is extremely approachable to both groups.
4,Funny book about punctuation,"Having studied English in college, I've always been a stickler for spelling, grammar, and punctuation. But I still learned quite a lot about punctuation from Truss' book, and had fun along the way. The author covers every kind of punctuation sprinkled liberally with examples of correct and incorrect usage. She also inserts humor every now and then, which is part of the reason why a book about punctuation has been such a hit. If you're a punctuation nut, this book is for you. But if you don't get too upset by misuse of punctuation, you might as well skip this one."
4,Good reminder!,"Listen, if you need help with punctuation, you probably need a big text book and several hours of serious study. No small, large print book will do the trick. However, if you want to brush up on a few things and smooth some rough edges, this book helps. The author is quite energetic and over-zealous about punctation (commas, colons, etc.) and its proper use; don't let that scare you off. It is filled with several quick lessons and facts that bring the whole puntuation picture together, piece by piece. It is a quick read and a fun one too. It is not the Bible of english grammar or punctuation, but what is? (i.e. everyone is in disagreement, everywhere)If you want to quickly brush-up and move on, read it. If you want to be over-zealous yourself, write your own book."
3,"Hey, there's a punctuation error in the subtitle!","The subtitle for this book is printed as: ""The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation.""Typically, when two or more words are used as a single, adjectival modifier immediately preceding the word they modify, they are hyphenated. For example:- an old-fashioned story- a black-and-white issue- a red-headed stepchild- etc. etc.The notable exception to the rule is when the first word in the phrase is an adverb ending in ""-ly"":- a swiftly moving stream- a densely packed '67 VW microbus.- etc.So, in the construct presented in the subtitle, where the phrase ""zero tolerance"" is used as an adjectival modifier for ""approach,"" it should be hyphenated. Hence, the truly correct, stickler-approved subtitle for this book ought to be:""The Zero-Tolerance Approach to Punctuation.""Just pointing that out."
5,Better than a book of one-liners!,"I bought this book as a means to help improve my punctuation, which it certainly will, if utilized. There are stylistic differences, due to her Brit origins, for those of us in America. But, I can't get through even a page of this book without laughing outloud. I would recommend this book to anyone. Period. Those who want to learn to punctuate with impunity will learn much from this short work, but everyone should get some wonderful laughs. I read this when I want a pick-me-up! Lynne Truss, you are an amazing, wonderful writer! This is one of my favorite books."
5,"Great book, Dumb price on Kindle edition","Terrific, entertaining, and instructive. I need to be reminded of some of these rules and usages occasionally. Would love to have the electronic version, but refuse to pay more for that than I would pay for the version that requires paper, printing, warehousing, and shipping. What's up with that, Penguin?"
3,tedious,"Fantastic book title! This book about punctuation came highly recommended, but I found it pretentious, chatty, and tedious. If you are looking for a concise guide to the use of commas, dashes, etc., this book is not for you. Rather, it provides a chatty history of English punctuation, which may serve as a good nighttime sedative."
3,I desperately wanted to love this book.... but it's cute,"As an editor and part-time teacher--with a history of teaching English grammar at various times in my teaching life--I pre-ordered this book with great anticipation. I was disappointed, probably because my expectations were so high. There are cute nuggets here and there, accurate and lively attempts at explaining punctuation rules. However, it is not quite as entertaining and engaging as I was led to believe it would be. For most people, I'd rate it at 3 stars. If you are an English teacher looking for ideas to inspire you into coming up with examples that will engage your students, I'd give it 4 stars. It's cute and mildly amusing but could have been incisive and engaging. I'll end on a strength: Truss does incorporate examples from the history of English, other languages, and printing about which not everyone knows."
2,"Truss, you ain't got it. :(","A book like this has needed to be written for a while. It's not a definitive guide to punctuation by any means, but it it aims to be a readble, fairly thorough romp through the little squiggles that make language intelligible.It's just such a shame that it had to be written by Lynn Truss, whose voice throughout is spiked with a false sense of bon homie and a very real smarminess. I heard her on the radio recently and she ain't funny in person at all, so why try in print?And another thing, she's pictured posing on the back flap about to add an apostrophe to an advertisement for the film 'Two Weeks Notice'. Why didn't she? I get the sense that all her talk of 'zero tolerance' and ambitions of literary militias are strictly posing as well."
5,"Eats, Shoots & Leaves","This is the one book I really wanted to pick up on a trip to London, England a couple of months ago.A best seller there, lo and behold, it has become a must-have in Canada as well! I had an English teacher from Yorkshire in high school, who drummed into all of us the importance of correct punctuation: errors drive me mad to this day,especially in business correspondence. My boss is getting a copy of this book, just as soon as I can get my hands on another copy."
5,Brush up on your grammar with a little entertainment,"If you've been wanting to brush up on your grammar, but you just can't make it through a chapter of Hodges' Harbrace, this is the perfect book. However, if you already know your grammar, you may disagree with some of Truss's more controversial stances on the nuances of grammar (such as saying Truss' instead of Truss's). If you are required to adhere to a specific style guide, then by all means, consult it and not this book. The APA Publican Manual disagrees with Truss on the subject of hyphens, apostrophes, and other matters of great grammatical importance.The bottom line: you will learn or re-learn some things, but not all of grammar is set in stone. But whatever your reasons for picking up this book, you are sure to be entertained!"
2,clarification,"To Teh Ai Lee ""Alice"" below:The error on the cover to which ""Bookman"" refers (I assume) is not the comma in the title - it's the unhyphenated compound modifier, zero-tolerence, in the subtitle.Perhaps that's a British English vs. American English issue - but it's pretty funny when talking about a lack of tolerence for incorrect punctuation."
5,More People Who Write In Public Should Read This Book!,"With English being battered by advertising for ""Krispy Kreme"" doughnuts and other deliberately misspelled words (mispelled so that they may be more easily trademarked), grammar and punctuation are becoming mere niceties, not essentials, of public writing -- and speaking, for that matter.Those who bray loudly in the public ear for ""civil discourse"" should read this book carefully before their next outburst. That way they might be able to articulate a complete sentence.There are many influences in society besides advertising that work to corrupt the English language. Lies, obfuscation, deliberate distortion, code words of political activists, propoganda, and ignorance all take their toll.This book is a modest antidote. It is most civil. It is correct in its assertions about grammar and punctuation. It is well-written. Best of all, the writer has a sense of humor."
2,"""The Brief History of Time"" of the 00's","Please forgive me if the apostrophe was inappropriately placed.I agreed with the title ""It's not clever and it's not funny"" to a point. It WAS clever and funny - for about five pages. Otherwise, it was plodding and tiresome.And regarding the title: It's a book that many people own but chances are, very few have even cracked it open and read it."
5,"As a humor book, it gets five stars...","I think some of the other reviewers skipped the introduction to the American version. This book isn't meant to show Americans how to use grammar and punctuation, it is meant as a humorous and commiserating book for those of us who always notice signs like:Chocolate ""Raspberry"" Truffle's, $1.00Taken as a humor book about punctuation, it is hilarious and well-written, even more so for those of us who love the slang and language differences in other countries.It isn't meant as an instruction book for Americans. A lot of the examples and rants would have lost their charm if translated into American English, so it is better than American editors kept their hands off of it and just gave us the funny British version. She represents such a British cultural phenomenon it would have been a shame to spoil it with Americanization."
2,repetitious whining,"The first few pages were entertaining, but the book quickly becomes repetitious. The book takes on a whining tone as the author complains over and over again about people who don't know how to use an apostrophe correctly. If you're looking for an entertaining book on grammar, ""The Elephants of Style"" by Bill Walsh is much better."
2,okay but not great,"I just finished reading this book, and I was not really that impressed. I found it to be quite boring. The whole book Lynne Truss just talks about all the errors people make on signs and in writings. She also points out ""rules for punctuation"" that almost everyone already knows. Save yourself some money and go to google and look for punctuation rules and just print them."
2,excellent beginner instruction,"This video is excellent for beginners in that the instructor is very clear about the movements and also uses two ""students""from a rear view,in order to better ,still,understand the postures.The only disappointment is that after the steps are individually learned,they are not shown together in a ""dance""(for lack of a better word)that one can do along WITH the instructor,nor is the meaning of each movement given,which is a very important part of the Tai Chi."
3,Good early morning watch,"I enjoy old movies and this one, a real movie critic might rate as a ""B"" movie or maybe 1-star. However I like both Mitchum and Brimley they probably did this one between real jobs just to stay busy. Movie has lots of flaws not the actors fault I especially like the scenes in tight quarters where you can see the boom mike swinging back and forth between actors. I found the movie entertaining pretty good story line and good flaws so for those I give it 3-Stars."
3,thompson,thompson is great. thompson is o.k. thompson looks good. thompson is great. thompson is o.k. thompson looks good. thanks thanks
5,Great movie. Robert Mitchum is awesome!,"Robert Mitchum is unbelievable in this film as a criminal being sent from one federal institution to another. When his niece frees him at gunpoint, Wilfor Brimley (the cop) goes to find the two of them. A gripping chase story with great acting."
3,Not much action or plot,Both of the stars were a little old for a cops and robbers movie--You could just about predict something before it occured. Hard to think they were still buddies to the end.
4,"The Lost Books is an ""eye opener""","Reading the lost books is an eye-opener for anyone who wants, ""the rest of the story"" of the bible. This book is the reprint of the 1929 version that went out of print for many years. The ""Forgotten Books of Eden"" , the second half of the book, also tells the stories of Eden that I was not aware of. It's worth your time."
1,"Interesting enough to read, blasphemous enough to not buy","How are these ""the lost books of the Bible?"" We cannot forget that the Bible is the word of God. It was inspired by God Himself. This book makes it seem as though God did not do a good job in keeping His word together. The Bible is complete. Let nobody add or take away of His word! This book gets a big TWO THUMBS DOWN! I gave it one star only because that is the lowest rating I can give. I just don't like what this book claims to be."
3,fairly good story,"The setting of this book takes place in 1900. The main character in the book is Oscar Westerwit, a squirrel who loves baseball and Broadway musicals. He heads up a team of animals to over come a gangster rat named Big Daddy Duds who ties to bring trouble to the park area. Find out if their plan works in The Mayor Of Central Park!The book was easy and fun to read.The characters in the book are animals. Children enjoy animal stories most of the time."
5,"Required reading for new ""Pumpers:","I had only been on my pump for 2 weeks when I read this book. It showed me many things I would need to make this pump work best for me. I don't think we can EVER learn enough about ourselves, or diabetes. Since I have to live with it, this book enabled me to equip myself with the knowledge needed to get the most benefits out of being on this insulin pump.Do yourself a favor and read this book."
5,My Favorite Diabetic Book,I am a practicing Internist with family members using insulin. This book strikes a nice center spot between the medical and lay person. I don't think anyone should even consider pumping until they have read this book and discussed it's contents with their doctor!
4,Profit offers amazing debut album,"American Famine is a phenomenal debut album. In it, Profit creates a lush multi-layered musical soundscape with the live band. The innovative and creative beats wrap around lyrics that can only be described as poignant, real, hard-hitting, on point and most desparately needed in these dark and last days. This album helps breathe new life back into hip hop."
2,"Good Movie, but Awful Movie Print or Transfer","From a content perspective, ""Kansas Pacific"" holds up pretty well.I bought this print of the movie because it was the most expensive and hopefully, therefore, the best transfer. However, this DVD has (1) awful video quality (NO detail in shadows and very poor sharpness) and (2) poor audio quality (noisy and low fidelity). I had recently seen a FAR higher quality print of this movie on cable. It is hard to imagine that either of the other two DVD prints of this movie could be worse than this one."
2,"Railroad goes West,must fight pre-Civil War Confederates","Railroad moving West,just before the Civil War is beset by problems. Construction boss (Barton MacLane)recieves help from the head office in the form of chief engineer (Sterling Hayden).Hayden quickly goes against the raiders led by ""Quantrill""(Reed Hadley and pre-Civil war confederates/ Average Western-B movie."
1,Beware,"This might be a great buy if you know how to read schematics. There is nothing easy about following the ""step-by-step"" format of this book. It had some great items to make, but if you can't understand the instructions it's no help. For that reason I rate it low."
4,Surprisingly good from a new band.,"It started out strong and got stronger. I didn't think anything new could be found listening to today's rap-rock, but this band actually surprised me. There is a definite seventies influence present and the energy had me tapping my feet along. Think Old Metallica with Limp Bizkit, run dmc and hendrix. Totally cool."
1,311 Rip offs,This band is nothing but a joke. I spent 2 hours of my life seeing them live play at Chuck E Cheezes and I want those 2 hours of my life back!!!!!!!!The people who are giving this CD 5 stars are actual band members. DO NOT BE FOOLED
1,"Started Interesting, but left with a bitter taste in my mouth","I was drawn into this book by the interesting writing and themes of landscape, aging, nature vs. nurture, morality and marriage. Although some of the characters began to disgust me, I kept reading because of the elements of mystery and the hope that things would take a turn for the better. Unfortunately, the end was horrifying and I was sorry that I had persevered in finishing the book. I wish that I had never spend time with the repulsive images and characters in this novel."
3,Cool game but not good for kids over 7,"This game is a kind of cool but it is not good for kids over 7. The graphics are pretty good for a game boy advance, but the levels are short and boring. Also much of the movie is not included in this game. Overall the game is not too bad."
5,I will earn more because of this book.,"I would hate to sell against this guy. Loyalty based selling is a fantastic book, especially if your sales depend on repeat business from current customers. Too many sales books focus solely on gaining new cutomers and new business. It was refreshing to read a book that discusses techniques to maximize current customers and the payoffs this brings. The author provides several very good tips that have helped me turn decent working relationships into unbreakable friendships. In addition, using the techniques discussed in this book, I have been able to penetrate accounts that I never thought I could crack. It is an entertaining book that I have read twice already and plan to read again."
4,"Is there more to come about the forebears of ""Whip"" Holt?","As usual, I loved this book as well as the others. I have read about Clay and Jeff Holt beginning with Westward! and I have just finished reading Justice! I am what you would call a history buff, and as I read these books, I found myself being whisked away to join the Holts in their exploits. The imagery and fantasy that comes to me as I read, creates a need to read more and find out as quick as I can what's going to happen next! However, the next series after the Empire Trilogy is the Wagons West Series with ""Whip"" Holt as the main character. He is nearly thirty in this series, which mean that there is a 20 some-odd year gap of time between the events in Justice! and Independence! I surely hope that there are more adventures for Clay, Jeff, Shining Moon, Proud Wolf, Ned, Melissa, and of Course ""Whip"" Holt on the Horizon!"
4,"A Happy ending, but could do without some characters","I just finished reading this book last night. Great story line and what I love most, the bad guys lose and good guys win. However, it could do without Ned Holt, India St. Clair and Matthew Garwood. I would've like to see Clay and Shining Moon have a child of their own. The story also could've done without Jeff Holt giving into temptation and having an Alaskan Indian Mistress."
4,Great product! Very happy with it!,Great everyday dinnerware set. Love the vibrant print and the usual Corelle chip-proof design!
5,Beautiful,I bought 4 sets of Hot Dots Corelle dinner set. It looks amazing and I love it. Already got many compliments from guests. Amazon did a great job packaging and shipping them.
4,Fun retro plates that will put up with the kids' abuse,Corelle plates are difficult to break and easy to clean. This is a fun retro set that adds some color to my cabinets. Great for families with kids.
4,Not Up to Standard,"This Corelle dinnerware is too thin. Does not hold up to Corelle quality. Colors are vibrant and fun.Corelle Livingware Dots 16-Piece Set, Service for 4"
3,Design Flaw,"The designs easily wear off and they were manufactured funky. Some of the dots are out of alignment and look very tacky. The Colors are cute and all, but when you can notice wear and tear so early on as I have, and I hand wash... I am very disappointed.Corelle used to be better than this. Sad.UPDATE: My cat knocked a set of dishes onto the floor and of three different brands, this one broke. The dish shattered into a million pieces. Shards were EVERYWHERE!! Very Disappointed. Will not buy Corelle again."
2,indestructable dishes arrived broken :(,"I was on a bargain high when I bought the 16-piece Corelle Livingware set(4 bowls, 4 large plates, 4 small plates, 4 mugs) in Hot Dots pattern for $17.99, but when it arrived, I could hear broken pieces falling inside the box. Opened it up to discover one bowl and one large plate were completely smashed. How disappointing that the seller packed the box so poorly."
4,"Fabulous, fun colors. Disappointingly small side plates","LOVE the colors of this set, which I've been advised is discontinued through the company's outlet stores.Be warned however that the bread/butter plate is SMALLER than what I expected. They are about 6 3/4"" across compared with the plates that I thought they would came (those measured a little over 8 1/2"").Still this is a great, fun set to use to mix/match colors and patterns. I am mixing with (discontinued) citrus (yellow bands), memphis (although the colors in Memphis are not as bright as these) and urban red."
1,Don't be fooled by durability claims!,"While the Corelle packaging touts durability - it breaks easily! In fact, the company website even talks about how easily Corelle shatters into ""many small pieces."" When a bowl broke, the shards were so sharp and much worse than a common ceramic dish. And as for that warranty on the box? Meaningless. Corelle said no when I contacted them about the poor performance of their dishware. Especially if you have children, I would not recommend Corelle."
4,an interesting episode,"The Invaders take over a business but their plans fall into the hands of the previous owner who tries to warn the world. The police think this man was killed and the hero of the show gets arrestedfor it.It has the guy who played the Mayor in ""Jaws"" as the top invader guy. He is cool and always makes a great ""bad guy""."
1,No reviews/comments?,YOU KNOW WHY!?!? Because its to damn high. WHo can shell out this kind of money. Amazon might as well remove this.
2,Horendous read.,"Maybe it's me and maybe but this is one of the worst books I ever read. I guess it just doesn't stand up to the standard of books I read, which is usually sci-fi, horror or fantasy. My usually authors are: Brian Lumley, Dean Koontz, Piers Anthony, John Varley."
4,Great DVD!,"This dvd is awesome. It contains all of Helloween's corny (but good) videos. I wish there had been a little more Kai/kiske era stuff on here (maybe some live videos or something), but we only get two songs from the Keeper Of The Seven Keys albums.The later helloween material isn't as good as older stuff, but it's still pretty damn good. The ""Just a little sign"" video is very strange, and it probably the best of the andi deris era.The first two videos are worth the price of the dvd alone (it would have been better if they had a ""Halloween"" video for the whole entire song though).If your a helloween fan, there is no doubt that you'll love this one!"
3,GOOD DVD BUT...,"I WAS HOPING THAT THE VIDEO ""HALLOWEEN"" SONG WAS COMPLETE... BUT IT'S NOT COMPLETE AND IS EDITED IN THE WORSE WAY....SEARCH FOR THE JAPANESE VERSION OF THE VIDEOS ....IT'S A LOT BETTER...I GUESS"
3,Re: The Shaper Book,"Was a little disappointed with this one. I was hoping for ""The"" definitive Shaper book and what it is is an entry level primer. Almost everything in the book is from the author's experience, he has not searched other sources of information. Fortunately, he does have a good range of experience, so if you are starting out the book has a place....but a whole chapter on basic shaper profiles seems a bit of a waste"
4,Darn good lil speakers!,"Ok for the price these things rock. The unit actually comes with the ac power plug as opposed tomost of the small units that are battery powered. The sound quality is actually very nice for the size. I've had mini sony speakers that sounded so much worse than these lil guys. I use it for my ipod at work and it's just excellent. The only thing I wish ithad was a volume control on them, but otherwise they are a great little pair of beat em up and use them lots speakers"
2,Not For Me,"I tried this along with Source Naturals Mega Beta Sitosterol for 3 weeks, and saw little to no improvement. Regretfully, I started back on Flomax."
2,Minimal improvement at best,"I did a lot of research on many different herbs and decided (based on the reviews) to give this a try. I was waking up at night and having urgency to go during the day. I've used this product now for a while and have seen minimal, if any benefit. No side effects but just hasn't done what I hoped it would do. I am going to try to increase the dosage but I don't think it's going to work."
5,They absolutely do work.,"I have been taking many kinds of supplements and several kinds of medicine for BPH. These work without question. The need to relieve is much less and the ability to vacate the bladder is much more. Take 2 pills twice per day, expects to see results several weeks after taking these amounts. Take the pills in the morning and in the early evening, not after 8 and you will see significant improvement."
4,Old School HWM,"This album is great and if you love Hot Water Music you will not be disapointed. The album rocks from start to finish. The only reason I gave it four stars was that the album just clocks in around 30 minutes. I wanted more. So if you like HWM, you should give it a try."
4,"Priced effectively, difficult to clean","For 10 dollars you can't really go wrong with it. You get what you pay for. You could probably build one yourself, but you wouldn't save much and this is made with a nice size slate to write notes on. I purchased it to write down ideas I had in the shower. I just hang it off the shower head and write down whatever comes to mind. I just wish it was easier to clean. Toothpaste or the ""Magic Eraser"" used to clean scuffs off of walls, doors and floors works pretty good, but those are a pain. You have to remember to buy those erasers or make a mess with the toothpaste. Soap will also work, which is what I'll usually use since that's already in the shower, but it doesn't get it all off so when it gets bad I'll use the toothpaste or magic eraser."
5,These are splendid images,"These photographs are absolutely gorgeous, every one, and the accompanying commentary gives you just enough context without bogging things down. It made me want to get to know the people in the pictures, and know their lives and their cultures -- and any book that makes you want to seek out more knowledge is a good book. No wonder this book won such a prestigious award."
2,Undelivered Product,Never recieved this order as well. In a nutshell i have never received any hard cover book order
1,Does NOT work with the iPhone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"When this device is plugged into your iPhone it says the phone does not recognize the device! Very disappointing:( I'm normally a 100% satisfied with products bought from Amazon, but this one I am not. Please be sure not to purchase this car charger."
1,it doesnt work!,"I bought the car charger it doesnt even work. Every time I tried to charge my iphone , it drained the batterry instead of charging it..... It suck.. Waste of my money"
1,False Advertizing,Just like the other reviews... I should have read them before I bought this product as it will not work with the Iphone as advertized and of course I found out after the 30 day return policy expired.. Warning this is a complete rip off.
1,Won't work with iPhone since new software release,"It used to work and when I download version 4, it stopped working instantly :-("
3,Shoe shine kit,Nice appearance but rather small ammounts of polish. Brushes somewhat hard for shoe surface. Overall it is as depicted.
2,Not A Great Buy,"The problem is as another reviewer stated, if this gets wet, its done. Plus if you install this as directed you have no way of using the Weber Kettle Cover. If you want a work station I recommend the Rio Adventure Aluminum Roll-Up Table - great portable table."
3,"Useful, but be careful","This work table is useful, but be sure to heed the warning about leaving item outside when not in use. Wood will warp and split on seams."
2,"Not really useful, more of a pain than a help.","I had this attached to my Weber because I am a pretty avid griller and prefer using the charcoal whenever I am able to. The work table isn't as convenient as I hoped it would be since it is so small and not very sturdy. In fact installing the stand that the wooden board rests on makes using and moving your Weber more cumbersome and the lid doesn't fit as nicely as before. I will say that the cutting board is nice, and to be able to use it inside in the kitchen and transport it to the grilling station is nice however any old cutting board would work. Do yourself a favor and get a separate side table or stand instead of wasting money on this."
2,"Good idea, but not weather proof","This little Weber table is a great idea, but in my opinion it should not be made out of untreated wood. I left it out one night and it rained....the next day it dried out in the sun and warped so bad that you could not put anything on top of it. The next day it broke in two."
4,Weber Kettle Work Table,"This is a very handy accessory for the Weber. It is not the most sturdy, but helps out tremendously when you need to put down a platter, thongs, etc. I take it off the grill after the grill is cooled down following each use in order to put the cover on. It's as simple as loosening a wing screw. Nice addition that is worth the price."
3,know what you are getting into first,"I bought one of these and very happy to have something to set things on at first. This unit is great if you are grilling, but if you are trying to control air flow for low and slow bbq this table frame hangs over the egde of the kettle and will keep the lid from sealing well. I find that I just don't use it as much as I used to."
2,Nice but unstable,"This is a very nice hard wood work table. However, the way it mounts is quite unstable, it can move left or right if not careful. It also creates a less than airtight fit when the cover is placed on the grill.Overall, I would probably not recommend this product unless you don't mind those 2 issues.Weber 1800 Kettle Work Table"
2,Don't get it wet,"The work table is plain wood, not sealed. There is a warning on the bottom not to let it stay wet. Since a charcoal grill must be used outside, I don't think the price justifies the limitations."
1,Nice idea but poor construction,"I purchased this item this summer. Since other reviewers warned about the table falling apart and suggested sealing the wood, I coated it immediately with 3 coats of polyurathane. The table fell apart anyway. I would not waste money on this product. It is poorly designed and lacking in the quality I expected from Weber."
2,a disappointing product even for a hardcore weber fan,"i've come to expect a level of durability from my weber, this product was more than a little disappointing. attachment to the grill is easy and it seems to be sturdy enough. however, the wood work surface, while nicely finished and fitting is not sealed for use outside. this means that you need to bring this inside and you cannot leave it attached to the grill.ordinarily not a big deal, but if you happen to forget to bring the work surface inside and it happens to rain, you're left w/a useless and broken worksurface. i would happily settle for some sort of composite work surface or a nicely sealed piece of wood as opposed to the raw wood product i received.i'm out the cash and i'm looking to replace the work surface with a nice piece of plywood which i seal with some sort of food-safe sealant."
2,wobbly work table,its made nice but the frame is kind of wobbly and its kinda in the way when takeing the lid off and on
3,useful but flawed,"Its nice to have a little table attachment for the grill that you can set a plate of food on or your cooking utensils. This one should have been made of plastic or sealed wood because, as other people have said, it will fall apart. I'll have to replace mine with a plastic cutting board as I neglected to waterproof it.My main gripe is that you can't put the cover on the grill when the table is attached, the cover fits tightly and there's no room in it for the table. You have to remove the table/bracket and stash it somewhere, which is a hassle. If you don't have a cover on the grill when it rains the ashes will get wet at the bottom and form a goopy sludge."
2,Like a gremlin--don't get it wet!,"Do not buy this planning to leave it outside on your grill! There were warnings with this product saying that it shouldn't be left outside, but I figured it couldn't be that bad. A couple months later, I discovered that my cutting board (left on a covered porch through a mild California winter) had completely split into several pieces. For a $30 outdoor product, this is really unacceptable. A plastic or metal cutting board would have worked much better."
4,Great for the price,"This is a cheap towel ring, in both price and quality. It looks really nice and would be a good replacement in a rental house or a basement bathroom. But the price is great and I was just looking for something cheap to hang a towel on, so it works great for me. If you are looking for something nice to put in your home, spend a bit more and get something quality, this is just chromed plastic. This is a case of you get what you pay for."
1,"Great Artist, Great Show, Terrible Recording",This CD was taken directly from the mixing board stereo output at the show... Many of the songs border on unlistenable. There is another disk from a December 15th show this should be available soon with much higher sound quality. I'd save your twenty dollars and wait for that one.
3,black gay poets,"Though this book was published after the tremendous success of ""Brother to Brother"" and ""Tongues Untied"", it is actually more affiliated with Other Countries, an East Coast black gay writing collective, established before those works. The devastating impact of AIDS on black gay men is apparent here: not only is the book dedicated to the deceased such as Essex Hemphill and Assoto Saint, but also 2 of the 11 poets had already succumbed to the virus. With all this talk of ""SGL,"" ""thugz"", and ""the down low,"" it may surprise many that there are many black men who do identify as gay. The poetry here is short. There is a larger text by 100 black gay poets refereneced here. Still, if you love black gay writing and want to support independent presses, do find this book."
2,This is almost all forest roads,"I was getting ready for a moutain biking trip to Sedona +/- Flagstaff. I got this book to prepare. Out of 25 rides listed for Flagstaff, I found 2 that I'd even consider. The rest were all roads. I believe there might be an audience for this, but those folks really just need a Forest Service map and can pedal anywhere there's an unimproved road.For the rest of us who want to go *mountain biking* -- we're looking for something more."
3,Ohhhh Schnebly,"Good directions and detail. Time for a new edition for sure! I did Sedona and this is what I found:Munds Wagon Trail is the stuff! It criss crosses Schnebly (forrest) Road.What a blast!! Bell Rock is good, once you motor past the hikers, be a good little biker and let the touristas know you`re passing. Look foward to Flagstaff when the snow melts."
1,Yuck,"The CD is fine, I have another CD of Mr. Al's and I liked it alot. I teach Kindergarten and use a lot of music. But the DVD is just creepy, Mr Al feels the need to cross dress repeatedly on the DVD. I thought it was funny at first, but I will never show this to the kids. Additionally during the song, ""Months of the Year"", when he gets to September, the leaves that he has falling all appear to be Marijuana leaves. I can't show that in Kindergarten. I would like to keep my job."
1,does anyone think she would be a music star if her parents..,Does anyone think she would be a music star if her parents were not OZZY and SHARON OSBOURNE? Kelly Osbourne is what is wrong with the music idustry.
1,Nepotism Alert!!,"Let's be honest folks, Kelly Osbourne didn't get a record deal because she had any talent, she got it because of her daddy and now that she has become a mini celebrity herself. One listen to her voice and you know she doesn't have a lick of singing talent to save her life. The songs are as generic and predictable as you can get. The only reason anyone even knows who she is is because of her father."
2,Hmmm...,"Well where to start? A- don't waste your money. If you feel like this is one that you just have to have, burn it, don't buy it. B- Please people, don't compare her to Avril. Avril IS an artist, Kelly is not. She is a rock star's kid, and because of that, she is famous. Because of that, she has the chance to make records. C- Like I said before, don't buy it unless you are a huge fan. Most people are right in comparing her to The Donnas..the sound is very simalar. I'm not too sure if she is trying to be pop, or punk. Whatever it may be, I am stuck in the middle. I like some, some I don't. All in all, I would have to say that this is one that you just have to listen to for yourself."
1,An absolutely friggin' great CD!!!!!!,"If you plan to use it as a coaster. It didn't let any condensation from any kind of drink container get to the surface of my desk. It's too bad that it dosen't work that well as a frisbee, or a ninja throwing star. You could also try using it to hold open the weatherstrip on your car's window when you lock your keys in it so you can jimmy the lock. There's a thousand uses for it, just put your mind to it & I'm sure you can think of a better use for this waste of plastic than was originally intended.Kelly Osborne. Singing... If that's what you want to call it. Save your money for a pair of earplugs, just in case someone near you bought it.The best things about this CD.1. It plays in standard CD players.2. It makes a great coaster."
1,Really bad...,"Kelly Osbourne should only sing in the shower. Watching the Shut Up video is like watching a train wreck. So horrible you can't look away. I wouldn't care that she is a chubby pinhead, if only she could sing. What irritates me the most is that because she is famous, people must always be telling her how talented and fabulous she is. I would rather hear another album from William Shatner then listen to this garbage.PS. Love the TV show though!"
1,ahh.... AHHHH!,"When i listened to Kelly osbournes album ""Shut up"" i was wondering why she didn't take that advice. The music sounds like someone picked up a guitar one day and said hey... i don't need lessons.. lol... she's horrible.. i'm seriously saying that my ears are bleeding.. everything about this album makes me want to puke. She much reminds me of Mrs. Avril lavigne who claims to be punk, but her album is actually bland pop without talent. Please, if you have any dignity or pride buy niether Shut up by kelly osbourne or let go by avril lavigne... But i do have to say that both of these cd titles speak to me. Kelly should literally ""Shut up"", and avril needs to ""Let go"" cuz she'll never be punk..."
4,I liked it.,"I thought this cd was pretty cool. It's funky and fresh and has a style all its own. It seems to me that everyone who hated the album seems to be just a little jealous of Kelly Osbourne, which is the wrong reason to give her album one star. It's a very unique first effort. And to the person who trashed her for not finishing school, well school isn't for everyone. Some people have a path that is only their own, and Kelly Osbourne is brave for having the courage to follow her dreams and hers alone. So Kelly, keep doing what you do, because you ARE fabulous."
4,Kelly Osbourne Superstar,"She loves, she hates, she sounds like a punk. If you like it loud and your life is a nightmare from which there is no escape you'll love 'Dig Me Out'. In 'Coolhead' Kelly gets right to the nitty gritty and stings with a stern, ""I'm not for you to adore."" And that look, like Lolita Humbert, like Daisy Clover, Kelly Osbourne sees more, gives more, and is more."
4,It's in the blood...,"Kelly's debut album ""Shut Up"" is, in a word, awesome. At first listen, you don't really get the full affect. However, this is definitely one of those albums that grows on you.The first track, ""Disconnected,"" is a delicious break-up rocker somewhat reminiscent of Alanis Morissette's ""You Outta Know."" On a more sentimental note, ""More Than Life Itself"" is a deeply personal and revealing look into Kelly's emotional side. This ballad is sure to move even the hardest of rockers.So please, support our little Osbourne. Musical sense definitely runs in the family! Keep on rockin', Kel!"
5,Great Debut!!!,"Okay, I'll admit it, I'm not a fan of Ozzy Osbourne. That's why I was a little skeptical when I saw Kelly Osbourne's new CD in the music store. Did she just wake up one morning and say ""Today I'm going to record a CD?"" But after listening to a few of the CD's songs, I realized that it was well worth the 15 bucks that it cost. This CD has fun, upbeat songs with a rock/punk edge. The Gutiar and drums on this CD were amazing!!!! Although I liked most of the songs on this CD, some of my favorites were ""disconnected"" and ""Come Dig me Out."" But, everything has its low points. The CD's duds were numbers 8, and 11. Number 11 on the CD was the only slow love song, but was a poor at showing her vocal range. Overall, I would say to buy this CD, esp. if you are a upbeat rock/punk music fan!"
4,Absolutely Great!,"After months of waiting Kelly Osbourne has finally let out her first album ""Shut Up""! I'm very happy to say that this cd didnt disappoint me in anyway! Most of the songs are very upbeat and have a great tempo and she wrote most of them! She is greatly talented and it makes me mad to hear people say she's not. The people that do are usually the people who dont even want to give her a try. I will say that Kelly's voice is limited in some matters, but not every singer should have to be the same, I mean what fun would that me? Anyway, I totally urge you to get this album is you havent already! ROCK ON KELLY!!"
5,Ozzy's Offspring is OF THE CHART!,"If you are an Osbourne's fan you have to check out Kelly's new album ""Shut Up""!! All of the songs have great beats. She is such a good singer! This CD puts anyone in a good mood! She's a great role model for girls and is just all around great!!"
1,I've Got a title for your new CD Kelly,"Its called ""Daughter Don't sing"". Thats how bad this cd is. When i bought this ""Tragic"" teenagers cd I was hoping for actual music...guess what I was wrong. I heard her alright version of ""Papa Don't Preach"" and I thought that if that wasnt half bad why should this be? Wow....Kelly really needs to take her own advice and shutup. Almost all of the songs on this record are unbearable. So this is why I am so sick of relatives of talented singers coming out with there own albums, they simply arent even close to being worthy of their sibling or father or whatever *cough Ashlee Simpson cough* so case in point. SHUT THE HELL UP KELLY OSBOURNE, YOU ARE NOT SOUXSIE FROM THE BANSHEES OR LITA FORD SO JUST TAKE YOUR OWN ADVICE AND SHUT UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Another Steaming Pile of Failure...,"Kelly Osbourne should take some of her own advice, and shut the hell up so that the world won't have to be subjected to any more of her incredibly irritating teeny-bop bubblegum pop ""punk-rock"". Her album is trash, pure garbage... the only reason this asinine pile of feces was released was because she is the idiot offspring of the once great Ozzy Osbourne. Keep thinking this lame-a** pop record is punk rock kids, I'm sure many of you will run home to the suburbs from the local strip mall so that you can add this vile creation to your CD collection that includes music from other media-w**** a**clowns like; Green Day, Maroon 5, Britney Spears, Simple Plan, Good Harlot, My Chemical Romance, Yellowcard, Coldplay, Kelly Clarkson, Avril Lavigne, and Bowling for Poop. This CD is an affront to punk-rock and more importantly music in general. I am glad that Kelly Osbourne a.k.a Ms. Piggy Jr. has found one thing she's good at... sucking a**."
1,don't waste your money,"this chick does not know how to sing.it sounds like a bunch of dieing horses singing but the horses sound better then she will ever sound,the only reason she in the business is cuz of papa."
1,Tragically Awful!,"This album never should have been made. I guess it helps when you have a famous father, but this not Nancy Sinatra. It's obvious that Kelly Osbourne worked hard on this record, but as they say, hard work doesnt mean much without talent behind it. I found this record to be tragically awful. The only clever thing about this album is the title. If only Kelly had decided to ""Shut Up"" before the album was made. I think I would rather fall on a grenade than have to hear another album by Kelly Osbourne. Buy her Dad's records instead."
1,I'd give it a zero if I could,"First thing's first: Kelly Osbourne can't sing. She was merely given this opportunity becuase she is on TV, that's it. If she did write all of the songs on this album, she makes Avril Lavigne look like Lennon/McCartney (forgive me for mentioning the Beatles in the same paragraph as Avril Lavigne and Kelly Osbourne). This record is just someone cashing in the The Osbournes sudden fame, which is a shame since Ozzy has been making incredible music for 30 years. Terrible record, don't buy it. Instead buy one of Ozzy's albums."
5,Great,"I love the single shut up and i think her album will be great. You can't judge her by her parents, because that's not why people like her. She is a great singer. And she is not overweight. She has lost weight, and who cares if she is heavy????? That doesn't have anything to do with the fact that she is doing what she loves, is having fun, is a great singer. Plus, she has her own style."
5,GREAT ALBUM!!! AWESOME!!!,"Wow! I never knew Kelly had such a great voice! She may not look like Britney Spears, but she's got a excellent voice! When she first performed at the MTV Music Awards I was amazed that she sung Papa Don't Preach, which wasn't one of my favorite songs, but how she sings it, it just sounds awesome! Like her father, i think Kelly has a LOT ahead of her, and I think she'll be really BIG someday! WAY TO GO KELLY!!! I really recommend buying this GREAT cd!!!"
1,Come on!!!,Good luck finding this CD now! How did this album get so many reviews anyway? I guess Im not the only one that likes to bash her every chance I get.
1,Kelly's music is no good.,"Do not be fooled by all of Sharon Osbourne's marketing tricks. She fooled everybody into listening to Ozzy's music, that he didn't even make. Don't be fooled into buying this boring cd.Kelly Osbourne makes her debut with Shut Up. She tries very hard to be punk but pretty much fails. She literally has nothing to complain or be angry about. Her voice is shrill, weak and hurts my eardrums. There is not one good song on this cd.Don't buy it!"
1,THIS SUXS,I have recently sampled the Kelly osbourne album at a record store. This only left me to discomfort and pain. I personally experienced pain the ears and and a deffening feeling afterward. The vocals are that of an american idol reject. And the lyrics are much like a 5 yr olds attempts at love.The only song i was semi interested in was come and dig me out. Everything else may have well left me scarred for life. DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM@!
1,shut up indeed,"the only reason this cd got one star is because it won't allow a no-star score. Shut Up, is [bad]. this...girl has not one ounce of talent in her ...body. be warned, this is a waste of money and time."
5,Dont Mess with Kelly!,"So, I didn't think that I'd like this album because I dont like THE OSBOURNES, but then when Kelly returned with ""Shut Up"" and ""Come Dig Me Out,"" as singles I loved them!!! The album is off the hook. She's got a lot of funky blends and her voice has so much control.Disconnected - 4/5Come Dig Me Out - 5/5Contradiction - 4/5Coolhead - 5/5 *EXCELLENT TRACK*Right Here - 4/5Shut Up - 5/5On The Run - 4/5On Your Own - 4/5Too Much Of You - 4/5Everything's Alright - 4/5More Than Life Itself - 4/5**BONUS TRACK**Papa Dont Preach - 4/5"
4,Real singers know how to say 'Shut Up'!,"I love this album so much .... The songs on here are so much more punkier and kelly, the songs are so much better than 'Papa Don't Preach'. The whole cd speaks nothing but truth and how better to do that then the 'tell it like it is' Kelly Osbourne. She says so much that no other artist would ever have the guts to say. The album is a total surprise and it is great! Kelly you rock ... way to go on your first album ever!!!!"
1,well the end is near,Despite the fact that I actually like the TV show for all its worth I don't take little miss Kelly as a serious artist. Most of all I would not want any one to suffer the misfortune of buying this CD. If you feel it still necessary to waste your money do it the right way burn it off the net.
1,just another else punkie,"I must say that i'm disappointed with this record...it's just another else punkie, like sum41, good charlotte, distillers, blink 182...the same damn thing...boring...it seems that everybody wants to be a Ramone or a Pistol, NY Doll, ...but they never will be...because they're uniques... Ramones are the fathers of PUNK!!! the rest is just imitation"
1,Nope,She has no musical talent. The only reason why she has a record contract is because she has a TV show and her father is famous. But everybody knows that right?
2,Nothing special,"I don't think Kelly Osbourne has a special voice or deserves to be making a CD. This is just a way of capitalizing off of her disfunctional family's fame from the TV show. A couple catchy songs that anyone could sing....if given a recording contract to do so. Sounds kinda ""teenish"" like Avril Lavigne...except Avril sounds more professional and her songs are better. My advice...this one is for kids."
1,Did I actually listen to the whole thing?!?!,Blararaghghgahragbh ohhh dear LORD in HEAVEN I think my STOMACH just heaved its way past my tonsils and it on its WAY OUT!!11!!
2,"Sloppy, messy, distracting debut","While I like Kelly's just released second album, Sleeping in the Nothing, this first one is one I really want to forget. Kelly Osbourne sounds bad on many of the songs and her voice is just hidden among the heavy layers of rock guitars that dominate this album. Shut Up is the only good track here. The rest of the album is a sloppy mess. And Ric Wake, known for producing my favorite Mariah Carey song(from '90), Someday, Taylor Dayne's hits and Jennifer Lopez, produced this album? This is his worst stuff here! They tried to model this album mostly after her more famous father Ozzy's rock and it backfired. Osbourne was smart to get Linda Perry to produce her second one, and the results are fabulous. Until then, just skip this first one from Kelly. This flopped badly in sales, and I'm not surprised that Epic dropped her from their label."
2,SHUT UP already!,"Kelly Osbourne cannot sing. I gave her a 2nd star because, unlike Avril Lavigne, she truly does not care what others think about her. However, her voice, I find screeching, and I also find it annoying that she thinks she is not pop however she is. I do think that Kelly would have more potential if she took a second to hear what she was doing instead of just shoving out this piece of garbage. Maybe a few lessons, or maybe she just needs tuning up. Whatever she needs, it's clear that she doesn't have it in her debut."
2,GREAT CD BUT HAS TERRIBLE FLAW,"Kelly Osbourne makes an impressive debut with this great album. When I saw her sing Shut Up sometime ago on Jay Leno I was simply amazed and shocked at how much this album is different from any other rock album me and my cousin have ever listened to. Kelly has the markings of many new rockers and she shows it on the Pat Benatarish Come Dig me out and a little pop as shown on the Vitamin Cish track More Than Life Itself. Now on to the part where this cd is the weakest link. Even though the sticker mentions Papa Don't Preach as a bonus track this track is nowhere to be found. How Could Epic promise something that is not there. But Still a good Album ...BR>Enjoy,Regis"
4,Very good,"I recently read that it takes the average signed rock band TEN YEARS to get a record deal.So right off it's easy to hate Kelly, since she got a record deal within a year of singing her first note purely through nepotism.But just because she won the life lottery, doesn't mean that what she does with that lottery ticket will automatically be trash. Quite the opposite.The songs (that she helped write) are solid, the backing band (notably the lead guitarist) are first-rate.It's a very good album. I'm finding it hard to believe even as I listen to it. But I can't deny its quality.Chick's got talent AND attitude, the vital combination when it comes to making good rock and roll, and she's done it here."
5,Kelly Osbourne is the BEST!,"First off Kelly's Debut album is the best CD i have listened to in awhile! i bought it the 1st day it came out, and i still listen to it atleast once everyday! All of her songs have an amazing beat, that makes you just wanna get up and start dancing! its great! i think kelly deserves more credit then she has recieved!....If you like rock, punk, pop music you will really enjoy this CD! I really think everyone should buy it, it is really worth the money! this cd is great and loads of funn! KELLY ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Rock On Kelly!,"Kelly, You Rock!!! I can't wait to hear your next cd! Every single song on this cd is awesome! Go out and buy it now!"
5,Spellbinding,"I've only recently gotten on an Kelly Osbourne kick and about the time I was becoming interested in her music her new CD comes out. It's fate I tell ya...Anyway...what a sophisticated and brilliant work this is. Awesome work of art, and haunting vocals, this is a CD I won't be without for a long time.It's clear this is an artist to be reckoned with.All the songs are easy on the ear and not only leave you humming the tune but also missing every minute you are away from them.Throw away your teeny-bopper and boy band CD's...this is THE CD to buy."
4,It's all just fun,"The album as a whole is pretty good...there are straight-ahead rock songs, a surf sounding track which reminds me of Southern Culture On The Skids, and some polished punk numbers.When I listen to this I can hear some of The Donnas and bit of the The Runaways on a track or two. The title song, ""Shut Up!"" is a catchy tune and I find myself singing the song in my head hours later.The album in a whole is good and should not be taken too seriously. If you can keep that perspective, you will enjoy this CD.I had to give it four stars...because it is what it is and it makes no apologies or tries to be something it is not. In the world of pop bubblegum and hairspray divas this CD is not that and delivers."
3,Shut Up and Listen!,"It's a playful mix of hardrock ,rocknroll, and polished punk.It's likely that this album would be associated with or paired with pop and/or poprock records due to her gender, age and image on this album.If you're familiar with who The Donnas are this album falls in that category.""Disconnection"", ""Cool Head"", ""Too Much Of You"", ""Come Dig Me Out"", and The comical drunk-at-a-bar karaoke styled ballad ""More Than Life Itself"" are all stickouts to me."
1,thumbs down,hey everyone weve got america's sweetheart kelly a beautiful young child who is just trying to live in her fathers footsteps by destroying the family name.Way to go kelly! Keep bringing in the dough and packing the heat.now ill go stuff my family jewels in a pickle jar.
4,Great Shoe,This shoe is great.. has great durability and breathability. The only downside I found is that it does not have the high arch support needed for my feet. This was easily solved with a Dr. Scholls insert.. Now they are most comfortable. Highly recommended.
5,Great Book,"Grof has written a super book that describes the many aspects of spiritual development. He aligns his core thoughts along the thoughts of Ken Wilber. This how ever is not Wilberian book and has many original insights, not mere theory. Grof is a gifted psychiatrist with no axe to grind. He, unlike Wilber who believes his theories hold and explain everyone else's theories, is much more open and unthreatened. He brings different viewpoints to his writing, without claiming to be the end all or have the last word. Get this book, you will not be let down."
5,a new approach o the mysteries of life,"joining the split between ancient wisdom and our scientific times, a deligthful text about the mysteries of existence, and some interesting answers about our nature like human beings in this loving planet"
4,Roadmap of the human consciousness towards cosmic reunion.,"Grof presents the imaginative realm of human consciousness and its return towards the ""holotropic"" state. He shares his insight into the psyche of the inward realm where exploration brings you to the mountaintop of existance; this is where the blissful states of the Enlightened mind awaits."
1,"Grof's ""facts"" highly questionable","While initialy intruiged by this summary of his life's work, I was very dissappointed to see Grof listing as fact a story of coincidence which did not ever happen and, in fact, was apparently first told as a joke by Buddy Hacket. For those of you that buy this book, the story of Neil Armstrong and Mr. Gorsky is not true. This laziness on Grof's part makes me question the other ""unbeleivable"" passages he casually mentions. Entire careers are ruined on this type of careless error."
4,I still like Scarpetta.,"Interesting, strange and detailed. Cornwell is amazing in her research and details of Scarpetta and her job in the morgue. She is thorough and keeps you on the edge of your seat from page to page wondering what will happen next. Just loved this book and could not put it down."
1,Overtraced,"I purchased this as an audiobook to listen to while driving. At times it became so long winded and boring I had to change to something else. This is actually the first 'Kay Scarpetta' novel I've read and it will be my last. To much overwording on unimportant details, using 50 words for what could have been said in 5."
2,Least favorite of the Scarpetta Series.,"I've read 15 of the Scarpetta books and Trace is my least favorite. I'm not sure what has happened. Prior to ""Blow Fly"" Kay was Kay, since she is no longer referred as such it is always as Scarpetta. To me it seems as though someone else has started writing. Trace would have had a good chance as the storyline was pretty good however, it just seemed like there was way to much going on... Benton in Aspen, Kay in Richmond and Lucy in Florida. It also confused me at one point as to how Lucy working in LA had anything to do with her house in Florida? LA was brought up a few times and yet it had nothing to do with anything. Oh well maybe I missed something because to be honest, I did a lot of skimming. I guess if a person wanted to skip a book in this series and not miss a thing, it would be this one."
1,One of the worse,This is a convoluted book with far too many different story lines. It takes too long to reveal how any of the stories are related. I also don't care for how Scarpetta is treated so poorly. Why would she subject herself to going back to Richmond??
2,Annoying,"Her attempt to write in the present tense (""Kay looks out the window"" rather than ""looked"") is annoying, and her characters (even the ones she wants to seem perfect) make really stupid errors."
3,Trace,"While this book was better than Blow Fly--it still did not measure up to the older Kay Scarpetta books. I liked the book, but it skipped around a lot and I felt that I was left hanging at the end of many of the chapters. Some things were never explained fully. Still, Patricia Cornwell is one of may favorite writers."
1,Another Disappointment,"After ""Blowfly"", I vowed to read no more Cornwell. The synopses convinced me to give her one more chance to bring back her vibrant, interesting characters from her earlier books. Well, they are not present in ""Trace"". There is no need to make prospective readers go through a wordy review. This book is boring and no better than her last several attempts to entertain her loyal readers. It is time for all of us to abandon the Cornwell ship and hope for a new John Sandford novel to be published soon. Retire Ms. Cornwell as you should have done several books back."
2,Did she run out of pages?,"I have enjoyed Patricia Cornwell's books in the past but this one was a major disappointment, particularly the ending. There was some attempt to build suspense...the bad guy seems to elude authorities at every turn...and then the ending is basically, ""then we walked up and tapped him on the shoulder and arrested him"". Huh? It's endings like these that make me imagine the author is typing away and suddenly realizes she's reached her limit for pages per the contract so needs to 'wrap it up' in a hurry. Too bad because her earlier books were so well done."
2,A Mere Trace of Evidence,"Dr. Scarpetta is on the trail of a killer again. This time, a mere trace of evidence, a trace so small, most would never find it, is the key to solving the mystery killer of a young girl. Politics, red tape, and uncooperative assistants make finding this trace nearly impossible. The characters are well-developed and intriguing. Sadly, the mystery involved in solving the crime is not very challenging to the reader, and leaves some readers feeling dissatisfied. Because of this, I don't plan to give the other Scarpetta mysteries a try."
2,Written in the present tense,"Why, oh why did Patricia Cornwell write this book in the present tense? This strange affectation makes the story harder to follow and much less enjoyable than anything of Cornwell's that I have read before."
3,My first Patricia Cornwell,"I'd never read a Patricia Cornwell before, but someone had recently recommended her books. So when I saw TRACE for sale, I bought it and read it.The story was quite good. But there were so many holes, like ""uh, did I miss something"" where I guess that's her style that you're just supposed to figure things out.I really hated the character Lucy and wished the murderer would kill her too. Oh well. Maybe these are characters that loyal readers have come to care for, but I wanted to push Lucy off a cliff, Benton & Henrietta too for that matter. How does a smart woman like Kay Scarpetta get all these losers in her life?Very good plot, satisfying murder mystery, interesting characters. I'd read another of Cornwell's books, but I think I'll start at the beginning."
2,More of the Same,"Scarpetta. has moved south from the Virginia Medical Examiner's office but is called back on a special case. From there, it's the same story that she has written many times before. Cornwell has gone to the well once too often and needs to change things up."
3,Dissapointed,"I have been an avid fan for a while now. I have to say this book started out to be a good Scarpetta, only I felt the ending was rushed like she was bored with writing the novel. There were not the usual details to wrapping up the story but rather you get a quick overview with no details. I felt she was bored with the story line."
3,What was that all about,"I have read all of the Scarpetta novels and this one left me saying ""What was that all about?""I agree with everyone else, this was not the Kay Scarpetta we have all come to know. This book just ended, it wasn't even finished as far as I was concerned. Maybe that is what Patricia Cornwell is doing, letting us wonder what happened to everyone and what is next?Blowfly was fantastic and a real shocker. This story didn't have any of the old drama or mystery. Kay was her usual self and was able to figure out who the bad guy was but this story didn't end; did it? What did Marino do? Lucy and Rudy? What about the new ME in Virginia? Kay and Benton? Nope, there has to be more..................?"
1,Kay Scarpetta needs to retire!,"Ive been a loyal fan since Postmortem, but Kay Scapetta needs to hang up her surgical gown, brush the chip on her shoulder and call it a day. It is incredibly disappointing to see this award winning series bottom out so pathetically. The inconsistancies are becoming more and more apparent. (It seems Scarpetta only ages 1 year for every 5 of Lucy's!) We the loyal readers need to be given a little more credit. But alas, Im sure if another Scarpetta is published I'll be there buying it. One can always hope."
2,Trace review,This book and her last Scarpetta both seem to have been written by someone else. It's like the author is narrating the book rather than Scarpetta as in her earlier books. She jumps around alot from Scarpetta to Lucy to Benton. I think she needs to go back to the original Scarpetta story-lines as they were much more enjoyable to read.
1,It's too bad....,"It seems that Ms Cornwell needs to do one of two things: 1) see a shrink herself to delve into what drives her to heap such wrath upon the head of her lead character, or 2) just give up what was once an exceptionally well-written series and find something else to do.Bad doesn't describe this book. Sad? Mad? Definately depressing and unreadable. What a pity that Ms. Cornwell has such a wonderful opportunity to portray strong, mentally and physically healthy women characters and instead chooses to portray them as weak willed, maudlin individuals totally incapable of finding strength in their own intellect and sense of self. I won't even go into the story line, which is the worst of cheap camp, immature and silly for a writer who once showed such promise. Overall, a disappointing, and ultimately final, immersement on my part into the world of Scarpetta."
1,"Long, Boring, Without Substance","Having vowed to never buy another Scarpetta novel after the pitiful offering that was Trace, I capitulated after reading rather good reviews - note to self: NEVER believe the reviews! At the end of this novel I was left wondering what on earth the whole thing had even been about! Plots meandered off into nothing (why on earth were we told about Marcus'anxieties if it wasn't being persued later??), and once again we were ""treated"" to Marino's obnoxious utterings, for no purpose other than to show us that he's still a pig. Benton made some token appearances, usually to tell Scarpetta he couldn't talk to her, and Rudi, Lucy's ""offsider"", prowled around the novel without any useful purpose at all. My advice? Buy the Kathy Reichs novel instead!"
2,Just when you think the story's going somewhere...,"...the book ends. That's my main objection to Trace. Cornwell sets up multiple plot threads to wind together at the end of the book, but despite all the obvious foreshadowing, it's not clear that many of them actually DO come together, except in a very contrived way.However, the forensics stuff and some character development can be interesting. Marino, particularly, exposes more of himself (emotionally and otherwise). I kept hoping that all the interweaving plot threads would end up making sense plot-wise and character-wise at the end. Instead, the end just happens, quite abruptly, as if Cornwell's publisher were enforcing a page limit. The worst thing is that some plot points are introduced fairly late in the book only to be dropped entirely, and I'm not sure whether they were intended as red herrings or if readers were supposed to reach some kind of conclusion on their own. I'd have rated it 3 stars if the ending had been even remotely satisfying."
2,another letdown,"why do we need to know that Dr. Marcus has a garbage man phobia? pointless to this pathetic mystery. At first, I felt we were back on the right track - Kay Scarpetta seemed ready to rock. However, it quickly veers off - spending way too much time remodeling Marino, reminding us that Lucy is still nutty, rich, and unhappy - and finally, that the old, impressive, Benton isn't coming back. why keep reading Cornwell? I guess I am still pining for the wonderful old Scarpetta novels!"
1,Boring and Poorly Done,"One can only assume that Patricia Cornwell is tired of these characters, so she should not write about them again. Thankfully, after the fiasco of BlowFly, I did not buy this book, but borrowed from the library, as I did expect it to be horrible. Wasn't disappointed."
4,Better than Blowfly,"Do not listen to the nay-sayers...this is the Scarpetta we've missed in the past two installments. Nice to have her back! The absence of that hokey wolfman character was a welcome relief, too. This book reenergizes the series, and I'm already looking forward to the next one."
1,Very Poorly Written,"I've read the earlier Kay Scarpetta books, and found them to be reasonably entertaining. ""Trace"", on the other hand, is just awful. As I slogged through the story I couldn't help but think of all the unpublished writers out there who can't get a foot in the door, yet this garbage is published and treated as if it's got merit. Did Cornwell suffer a brain trauma somewhere along the way? Did she bother to read what she had written and see just how ridiculous it sounds? In earlier books, the characters were somewhat believable, but in ""Trace"" they all seem two-dimensional. I'm scratching Cornwell off my list of worthwhile authors. Save your time and money. This one isn't worth either."
3,It's the narrator that makes Patricia Cornwell palatable,"I've read a few Scarpetta novels over the years and am always always always left very disappointed. I haven't quite figured out why I kept thinking things would get better with Cornwell's books and characters, since ultimately not one of them is likable in any way, since nothing ever improved...until I started listening to them. Oh, they're still bad and I still don't like the characters at all and wonder how Cornwell's managed to continue selling books. But, as my title states, it's the narrator that makes these books palatable. The narrator in question is Kate Reading and honestly, I will pretty much listen to anything she does. She's got a voice that makes even these crummy Scarpetta novels not so crummy.I gave ""Trace"" three stars and believe me, it doesn't have anything to do with the book. It's all Kate Reading's doing and I'd give her five stars without blinking, but there's got to be a limit. It is, after all, a mediocre story, at best."
1,Very disappointed,I typically listen to the Kay Scarpetta series in audio form during my daily commute. I found myself yelling a the CD to 'move it along'. Ms Cornwell goes on and on and on in this book about pointless conversations and meaningless details. I have no idea why she has made all the characters mad at each other. I find it distracting from the story. I probably won't be back for the next in the series.
1,What a total waste of time,"1. I'm not an ""expert"" on this author (I've read one prior book by her). But from the recommendations of my friends, I decided to give this author one more try--> what a total mistake. Via the reviews on her prior books, I'm sure that she has written some good stuff. However, this book appears that it was written as an afterthought; something written to appease her publishers... which is a really sad thing to see.2. Bottomline, if you value your time--> skip this book and do something else more worthwhile."
2,Weird Style,"Being an avid Kay Scarpetta fan I was looking forward to reading this most recent addition to the series, unfortunately I could only make it through the first 50 pages before I gave up reading it. The book is annoyingly written in the present tense in short choppy sentence making it very hard to follow. I hope the next one is better. Maybe it's time to end this series...?"
2,Dissapointing rehash of previous themes,"There's political machinations to keep Dr Scarpetta down, there's a misbehaving Marino sleeping with enemy (another sociopathic woman with a dead child), there's an innocent dead child with all the usual tearing at heartstrings, this is just a rehash of previous novels. What happened to Patty? I understand if she wants to take all the money she's made and go do fun stuff, but please, don't try to fob off C- work on the public... if you want to write, Cornwell, do it right. Otherwise, let us find new voices whose hearts are totally into their work. I'm done, I've paid $27 once too often."
5,Trace by Patricia Corwnell,"I was disappointed with Cornwell's last book ""Blowfly""..however, her new book ""Trace"" seems to have her original crisp, intelligent and suspenseful style. All the old characters are back-- Marino, Lucy and Benton..and the story brings her back to Virginia, her old turf. The intrigue of the story begins here, with a new medical examiner who has a shady and questionable past. Scarpetta is called in as a consultant on a troubling case - the death of young girl. I think her readers will be pleased with this new addition to the Kay Scarpetta series."
2,Don't waste your time,"My first and last Cornwell novel. No plot, no suspense, a complete waste of time."
4,Trace,"This is the 13th book in the Kay Scarpetta Mystery series and there have been 300 reviews posted on amazon.com that range from raves to rants. I've read almost all the books in this series, and found this one to be both well-written and interesting. In fact, after reading this one I read Blow Fly which also got a lot of negative reviews, and I thought that was good, too, except for a weak ending. The scenes set in the old morgue building Scarpetta once worked in are both griping and fascinating. This book moved along and kept my interest from start to finish."
1,What a Let Down,"I have practically been praying for a Scarpetta novel even half as good as the first several, but alas, this is not the one. I haven't given up yet though!"
3,"Better, but not worth buying","Finally we're back to Kay Scarpetta in what she does best - determine the cause of death. And Benton is mostly back to his former FBI self. But this still wasn't reason enough for me to recommend anyone actually buying the book, either in hardback or paperback. I checked it out from my local library when they got a copy (yes, I live in a small, rural town). In fact, I reserved it when the book was only on order. I'm so glad I waited. Use your local library."
2,New Providence Reader,"After the disappointment of ""Blow Fly"", I bought ""Trace"" with some trepidation. It was better than ""Blow Fly"", which I thought was one of the worst books I've read, but I am ever a hopeful Scarpetta fan. ""Trace"" was a good read, but as with the past few Scarpetta books, it finished up in such a rush, I kept thinking I must have missed something. I became a fan of Patricia Cornwell's when I first picked up ""Post Mortem"" from the library about 9 years ago, and have read all the Scarpetta novels. After reading ""Trace"", I am now re-reading ""Post Mortem"", and there is no comparison. ""Post Mortem"" is descriptive and in depth and makes me wish the new books by Patricia Cornwell would have the same great writing and story telling as her first few Scarpetta novels. Please!"
2,one more of the same from Cornwell,"This is the 1st time I've read a book by Cornwell in a long time. They haven't changed. Characters are all in need of phychiatric help, her villian is over-the-top awful and there are too many little subplots tossed in."
2,Trace,"The last few books have been horribly disappointing. In ""Trace"", she left characters hanging, subplots unfulfilled and the ending was a ""hurry up, finish, and let's get this book to market"". I have probably bought my last Cornwell hardback and will rely on the paperback market after all reviews are in. It is time Cornwell stops resting on her laurels and writes a book that resembles her earliest attempts and successes. There were no thrills or suspense in ""Trace""."
2,What's Going On?,"The last two Scarpetta novels have been truly disappointing. Trace left too many unanswered questions. What happened to Gilly's dad? What's up with Gilly's mom? What's up with Dr. Marcus? What's wrong with her former assistand M.E.? Why is Lucy self-destructing? I am hoping her next book will address all of these issues. I used to look forward to Patricia Cornwell's books coming out, but after these last two....Let's hope Patricia Cornwell goes back to the basics with her next Kay Scarpetta novel."
1,"Tripe, not trace","Cornwell is clearly running out of ideas. This book is getting close to being very boring, and deserves to disappear without a trace."
3,an improvement,"I had said I'd certainly never buy another Kay Scarpetta--and probably not even read one. But I picked this one up, and found it, after all, a good read. Of course, you have to get past the fantasy of everyone just having oodles of money to do anything they want, but at least there's no strange criminal with a weird metabolic disorder, nor does Carry Grethen (that Napoleon of crime) turn out to be responsible for everything.It's true Cornwell doesn't quite know what to do about Benton Wesley, and there are some loose ends (procedural style), but the roundedness and reality of Marino in this book are alone almost worth the read."
5,flawless mystery,I couldn't put this one down. An absolute page turner with twists and turns on every page. Cornwell continues to be the number one forensic author in the country.
4,Bravo!,"Having tried to read Cornwell's Scarpetta series twice before - and never being able to finish them, due to her almost totally unlikeable characters - i.e. the grumpy, testy, always angry and arrogant Scarpetta herself (not to mention the arrogant, testy, angry niece, etc) I was then quite SURPRISED to find this book so good.Actually, I listened to this book on CD - given to me as a gift. And lo and behold . . . it was really good. Bravo!All the little pieces Cornwell sets up and then ties together, along with the fact that this book was less about Scarpetta herself and more of an ensemble than the others books I tried and rejected - made this truly interesting.Good story. Well done. Kept me interested all the way through."
1,Trace.....of what?,I am not sure what has happened to this truly amazing writer's books---- this work plus those that followed have lowered the bar of excellence to the ground.
5,TRACE,"I have been an avid reader of the Scarpetta Series by Patricia Cornwell. Ms. Cornwell is my absolute favorite writer. I have already read TRACE and am presently reading PREDATOR. Once a book is started, I have to consciously remind myself that there are other things that demand my attention besides reading these novels. I must say that the stories need to be read in sequence or the lives and adventures of the characters will be lost and not understood. Each story either continues into the next book or a new twist / adventure is discovered. Being in the medical profession, I thoroughly enjoy the medical/forensic discussions between Scarpetta, Wesley and Marino. There hasn't been a single story line that hasn't brought to light information that is extremely fascinating. Again, bravo to Ms. Cornwell for such fabulous novels. Please don't stop writing the Scarpetta Series."
3,always entertaining but not as good as some.,Cornwell's Scarpetta mysteries are always enjoyable entertainment. This just wasn't as good as some.
4,kay scarpetta is challenged,"The characters enter conflict. Lucy and benton are not speaking to scarpetta much. They each seem to be off in their own universe. Lucy is wrapped up in this situation with a woman named Henri. Whether they are partners, it was never clear, but she spends an awful lot of time absorbed. What does she do about the suspicious neighbor watched her rented house?Then there's Marino, who I have an affection for--as a character. He seems to lose his mind in Trace, opening his mouth when his opinion is not wanted. Do his actions have anything to do with excessive drinking? Then he seems to start feeling romantically toward Scarpetta.Kay does not know why she is being drawn back into her old job.I rate this book A; I haven't finished it. The complex characters have me asking lots of questions. Ready to launch into the next book to see how it unfolds."
3,Trace,"I've enjoyed the many ""adventures"" of Scapetta. This novel closely follows her established patterns, though Cornwell did try to spice it up by having her ""return"" to her previous area. Still, even with the extras thrown in, I felt it could/should have been establishing a somewhat different mystery. Disappointing."
2,Sadly shaking my head...,"I agree with most of the (negative) reviews, so won't rehash the storyline or the many, many disappointments (present tense, 3rd person, no mystery over who the killer was, several uncompleted plots, wanting to strangle Lucy, etc.). I keep reading Cornwell, foolishly hoping she will get better (if it is indeed her writing these books), because I am invested in the characters, but I'm going to have to come to the acceptance that this series has died."
4,She's back!!!,I have always been a fan of Patricia Cornwell and then something happened....her stories were no longer as good as they used to be... Some elements of her first novels were no longer there..I hesitated to buy Trace but had read a review in the newspaper and decided to try one more time..Am so glad I did. It just ended to soon ....
1,GOES NOWHERE!,"This is the last Patricia Cornwell book I will buy. This book starts slow, does nothing to capture the attention of the reader and goes absolutely nowhere. Very disappointing to a big Kay Scarpetta fan!"
1,difficult to listen,this book is very hard to listen to. lots and lots of profanity. it's read by a woman who then tries to disquise her voice as a man's. just doesn't sound right. why not have a man read for a man's part and a woman read for a woman's part? did not continue after the first chapter. this is a great author and the audio book is a sad way to 'read' one of her books.
3,A Skuttled Novel,"I have to agree with most of the other reviewers in saying this was quite a let-down. Another apt title would be ""A Burden of Details"", since this is what this novel is full of--too many, and irrelevant details that drag and, right at the end, an ill-fitting Disney ending that falls flat on its face. Oh dear Cornwell, you know you can do better than this."
1,disappointed is not enough of a word,"Once again, after reading Blowfly...I had to force myself to read this incredibly boring book. I kept reading, looking for the ""punch lines"" or the meat of the book. unfortunately, with the ending of the book...there just wasn't one. You had to add your own theory between Scarpetta..Benton..Lucy..and Henri. Talk about no meat. Where was the story?? Why did Henri even go and stay with Benton? What was the sense if Benton and everyone involved knew she was lying? What the hell was Lucy hiding from Scarpetta after everything her and Lucy had been through in the past? I hate it when I read a book, and I am pissed off at the end that I wasted my time. Sorry Ms. Cornwell, but this is the last book that you will suck me into buying. I don't know if your editor is pushing you or not, but I would think that you are professional enough, and have pride in your own writing that this would not be the case."
2,Certainly not Scarpetta's best ) :,"Unfortunately, as big a fan as I am of the Scarpetta series, I must admit that alas the magic is gone. This book dragged, unlike earlier Scarpetta page turners that kept us up reading late until the night!No questions are answered about Benton & his and Kay's relationship. Little is resolved there. Marino gets involved with the mother of a victim (hmm.... deja vu?) Yet another jealous M.E. tries to set up Scarpetta. Is this sounding too familiar?Overall rating, an ok of 2 stars. Yes I will continue to read another installment of Scarpetta because I adore her character, but hopefully the next one is better."
2,what happened to TRACE,"I felt completely let down by this book. I have been a Cornwell reader for many yrs now, but the last two books have not been up to her usual terrific caliber. There are so many loose ends with this book. I'm very unhappy."
2,A Trace of a good book,"I've enjoyed many of her books, and was looking forward to reading this one. I bought it the day it when on sale, but should have waited for the paperback. The plot has many things going on, but she does not go into any details. The ending just seems to ""happen"" and it all seemed so predictable. Her eariler works were much better. Trace has a trace amounts of plot, mystery, character development and excitement. Better luck next time PC."
2,Somewhat of a disappointment,"I think I should have known better, it was not long ago that BlowFly was published and Trace came out pretty soon after. Blow fly was a disappointment and this is not that different.The whole Lucy scenario, Come On stop having her date this horrible women, there is so many bad, emotionally disturbed partner one can have. After a while it is like, get a different story line already. Already we have a very smart tortured heroine in Scarpetta and now Lucy too, seems like a unnecessary competition for stories.And the whole story about Marino and the mom of missing girl. How lame is that, there is this whole suspense about what happened and he has all these scars and to end it without any closure seems so blah.And Scarpetta used to cook more and talk about it more, it does not seem like it these days. After blowfly I was still interested in buying another book but now, library will be the way to go."
3,Good bye Kay Scarpetta,"I thought I'd give PC one more chance and read Trace. The very first thing I noticed was how angry ALL the characters are. Is this because the author is angry? And the 3rd person POV left me feeling alienated. I did and do prefer the first person. I don't like it that Kay is now referred to as Scarpetta, as if she is someone we don't know. Unfortunately this will be my last Cornwell book also......good bye old friend."
1,What has happened to Patricia Cornwell?,"I was someone who always anxiously awaited the next book in the ""Kay Scarpetta"" series. And I am also someone who is always willing to forgive an author for an ""off"" book. But to follow the very disappointing ""Blowfly"" with this even more disappointing book kicks me right off the Patricia Cornwell bandwagon."
1,This book stinks!,As a devoted Dr. Kay fan I must say that I decided to give Patricia Corwell another chance after Blow Fly but I made a mistake. Plain and simple this book is terrible. It is slow to develop and has a shoddy plot line. I think this will be the last Dr. Kay and Patricia Cornwell book that I ever read. Don't waste your money on this book.
2,Not what I expected,"I eagerly awaited the release of Trace, however, was disappointed. I was overwhelmed by the 3 different plot lines. I thought the writing was disjointed and hard to follow. Trace was not at all like Patricia Cornwell's previous Kay Scarpetta mysteries."
1,Discouraged,"I liked the Scarpetta books in the past but the last few have been .. awful. I thought bringing back Benton was just way to soap operaish. Trace started out interesting with her going back to where she had worked but most of the plot after that made no sense. Her niece is really too strange for words and her part in the story was unnecessary except to make the story longer. The bit with Benton coming back and her going back to him without a problem was just not believeable. I doubt I'll read any more of her books. It's a shame, the first ones were so neat."
2,50% ONE STAR REVIEWS AND THE BOOK STILL SELLS,"There's a boat load of reviews for this book so I'm not going to write one. This is more of a comment than anything. I've read all of this author's books and the first eight or so were excellent and for the past 3-4 years, they've gone downhill.I'm disappointed, as are a lot of Patricia's fans. 50% of the reviewers ""HATE"" this book...wow, that's a huge number.So disappointed, but, there's a lot of other great authors out there to choose from."
2,Not her best work,"I found myself skimming over parts of the book. She is one of my favorite authors, so I was disappointed when the only satisfaction I got was at the very end."
3,Just okay,"I was not nearly as engrossed in this book by a long shot as I normally am by the Scarpetta books. It was okay, not very exciting in my opinion."
1,you should give this book away for free,I could not get past the first 50 pages. It is odd and so not like the Cornwell of the older days. So sad to have waited for this.
1,What Happened to Patricia Cornwell?,"This book was the worst one of her Scarpetta series I have ever read. It seems as if Ms. Cornwell is not happy writing the series anymore. I feel as if that comes through in her writing. This book was not fun, fresh or scary like her other ones were. The last three books we not good in anyway. Blow Fly was such a disappointment and I thought this one would be better and it wasn't. Lucy, Benton, Marino and Kay used to make reading enjoyable. Now a person just reads the books to get finished with them, with nothing to take away from the books but unhappiness that a person wasted time reading it. I sincerely hope that Patricia Cornwell goes back to the formula that made her earlier books so well liked. The way she is doing it now, is the way to lose fans."
1,Don't waste your time!,"Trace is awful! We used to be such big fans but this is definitely our last time to read one of the Scarpetta series. The characters are mad all the time, loads of extraneous information and story lines that go nowhere. I'm surprised I could finish it, I just kept thinking it couldn't be that bad and waited and waited for it to get better. It doesn't!"
2,"Better than Blow Fly, but then what isn't?","From starting out as an author you couldn't wait to read, Patricia Cornwell is continuing her downward spiral. Yes, it was better than Blow Fly, but that book was so revolting - both in concept and in writing - that anything would be an improvement. This book started out interesting, but quickly disintegrated. What was the clincher was that Scarpetta all of a sudden remembered the suspect's name and everything about him...and professed to hardly remembering him at all. Hmmmm.....that kind of says it all."
2,A Disappointed Fan,"I was a HUGE Cornwell fan for years and recommended her books to EVERYONE. But I am so sad to see what is becoming of this series, and I'm tired of paying these prices only to be disappointed. First, what happened with Benton was downright cruel. In Cornwell's latest installment, Scarpetta and Marino seemed tired and washed out; the two made ME tired. And Lucy...what is with Lucy? I don't even like her character! The plots starts off on an interesting note, but it just went downhill from there. Marino wasn't so bad, I've always loved him, and the scene where the dead girl's crazy mother bites him and Scarpetta examines him was touching. and then FINALLY she and Benton get together, well, maybe, but not quite sure. Cornwell is far too talented for this, and I long for the days when I could not put the book down. I have not enjoyed her books since ""The Last Precinct,"" and, should I ever buy another book, I will not spend the kind of money I spent on this one."
1,Trace,"I wish I would have read the reviews BEFORE I bought this book...alto, I probably would of bought it anyways...I have enjoyed ""most"" of Cornwell's books (earlier ones much better), this one was the worst!! I concur with all the reviews...what a waste of time and money....left me very disappointed. It seems like Cornwell gets more and more gruesome as the books go on...and so many unanswered questions at the end of the book. I think this will be my last Cornwell book for a long time...if I buy it will be a ""used"" paperback!!"
2,Time to Retire Dr Scarpetta,"I have loved the Scarpetta novels for years. I ran to the bookstore to snatch the newest installment off the shelves and sat up reading way past what logic, employment, and grad school would allow. I'm not sure I will do that any longer.Trace lacks the energy of previous novels. The characters lack energy, the plot lacks energy, the dialogue lacks energy -- I'm beginning to think that Cornwell lacks energy. I agree with the previous reviewers that it seems that Cornwell no longer likes this character and it dragging this relationship past its limits. Perhaps it is in the interest of her fans..I know my personal feeling is that I don't want to see the Scarpetta novels end, but I'd rather she go out in a blaze of glory than the self-absorbed whimper Trace seems to be.If you're a Scarpetta fan, avoid this novel. If you haven't read Cornwell before, try some of her earlier work. I'd hate for one experience to turn you off her completely."
2,Very Disappointing,"I have been a huge Kay Scarpetta/Patricia Cornwell fan from the beginning. However, this latest book fell flat. The reader never gets any answers to the one murder Scarpetta is supposed to solve, other than who did it and we basically knew that in the beginning. She threw strange plot lines in that not only didn't add to the story but were distracting and created questions that went unanswered. The book never even explained why the killer chose his victims - only why he was going after his ""big target."" There was an entire chapter devoted to an encounter with Marino and the grieving mother that started to appear to provide the answer as to why the victim was chosen, but again nothing - it was just dropped. The ending was abrupt and left all the sub-plots unresolved. The ending almost seemed as if she got tired of writing and just stopped. Killer caught - book over. I really hope the future books will be like her originals. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to other authors."
2,NOT good at all,"I only gave this book two stars because I am very loyal to this author. Unfortunately, this book is horrible. Blowfly was REALLY bad. This one is also bad, not as much but... I read the other reviews and I believe the book was given okay reviews because the previous book was so awful that this one seems good compared to it! I am so sad that P. Cornwell is continuing to murder the characters that we love so much. I can't stand this anymore and I don't think I will be buying her other books."
2,Not the Cornwell I enjoy....,"I love spending time with my favorite fictional friends; however, I am beginning to think it's time to avoid Kay, Pete, Lucy and Benton for awhile. They've all become such downers. Where is the sense of humor? Where is the twinkle in the eyes?Each one of them could benefit from a personality labotomy. We, as readers, are forced to see their multiple short comings and psychological weaknesses, plus their never-ending analysis of each other and their relationships. Enough! Cornwell needs to return to the heroes who did not have more problems than the bad guys."
2,So disappointed,"I fell in love Patricia Cornwell's earlier books but the last two have just left a bitter taste in my mouth. The ending is to abrupt and it just doesn't flow well. Too many subplots and things are left unexplained. If you want a gripping read I recommend ""Out of Reach"" by Patricia Lewin. Great book....I read it in less than 4 hours. It grabbed me from chapter one and didn't let go."
1,Wish I wouldn't have wasted the time,"Oh my gosh, this is one of the WORST books I have ever read! I cannot believe it even got published. I was a loyal Cornwell fan, but after this I am having serious doubts about ever reading another one. I am actually kind of mad about wasting my time on this one."
1,Worst yet by Patricia Cornwell,"I used to believe that I could count on a book by Patricia Cornwell being a good, solid read. The last two books by her have not met my expectations. This one was so dreary, hard to follow (and really so depressing who wanted to follow it) that I had a hard time finishing the book. What a disappointment! It is time to drop Kay Scarpetta, Benson, and Lucy. In the tar pits. I feel that I wasted my money buying this book at half price!"
2,Cornwell going downhill,"Just sending in my agreement with other reviewers here who panned Cornwell's latest effort. The pacing and excitement of her previous novels are missing, with numerous extraneous story lines taking up space and then disappearing. Then, it was like she was told to wrap it up at 400 pages. The clunker ending positively oozed to a conclusion with no buildup, just a brief explanation of where the main characters were at the ""last day"" nothing more. Please stick to the basics here: Scarpetta, Marino and murder! It makes such a better read than all the tidbits which were crammed into this."
1,Don't bother,"Just take a look at how many people are selling their copies and see what they are willing to accept for them. That will tell you how much readers liked this book !Patricia Cornwall just doesn't have it anymore. That is a fact. I love Kay Scarpetta and and I have so enjoyed the books about her, her family.. and her job but this book was pathetic. It jumped around and never really got into anything.Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere. This book was awful. I finished it, but only because I keep waiting for it to get better. It didn't.Patricia Cornwall should just relax and enjoy her millions. As a writer of good fiction, she has lost it along the way."
1,Looking for a Trace of a storyline,"This has to have been the worst of the worst. While I've always enjoyed the Scarpetta mysteries, the only mystery we have in this book is: where's the mystery? The story was disjointed, there was no plot (or even a hint of one), no resolution or explanation of anything pertaining to the basis of the story. Characters introduced, barely explored and discarded.I don't plan to purchase any more of her books until I'm sure it won't be a repeat of this disaster."
2,What's with Ms Cornwell?,"Although I've read all of Patricia Cornwell's novels and have appreciated her work over the years, every now and again she misses the mark. Unfortunately, this novel represents one of those times. She is a craftsman skilled in the genre of the suspense novel; however, Trace is missing many key elements. No action, no climax and a pathetic ending that leaves the reader wondering if this novel was written solely to fulfill a contract deadline. I think Ms Cornwell does her best work when she is enthused about and dedicated to her subject. The character, Kay Scarpetta, has served her well in the past...not the case here."
1,A Real Disappointment,"I just finished reading Cornwell's book, Trace. I am a huge PT (Scarpetta) fan and was looking forward to this book. As I read this book, I kept waiting for the suspense, interesting plot development and climax. Unfortunately, they were all missing in this one as were the tying up of some loose ends. There were areas in Trace where the author was vague, redundant and flighty. It is hard to believe that it was indeed written by Patricia Cornwell. All in all, I am very disappointed in this offering by Cornwell. Although she is still my favorite she missed the mark on this one.Suzannez"
1,disappointing beyond belief,"i cannot believe how poorly written the last 2 scarpetta books have been. with trace, the story is all over the place. there isn't any of that ""scarpetta charm"" that carried through the previous novels. ms. cornwell should've ended the series with the Last Pricinct. trace is just that, a trace of what scarpetta used to be. you can only feel sorry for a character so long before you realize a smart educated woman needs to take control and stop whining about the men/problems/family she has."
3,almost back to her original Scarpetta style...,"Glad to see that Ms. Cornwell has returned to her original style of writing in her Kay Scarpetta novels. I don't understand why all the male characters close to Dr. Scarpetta are killed or seriously injured. In Trace, you get to see the personal side of Pete Marino and more of his ability as an investigator. I have always liked how Ms. Cornwell explained the reason for any forensic procedure or need for further investigation. I did not appreciate the on going negative remarks about the city of Richmond, Va. however."
3,I have to agree with all the other reviews.,"This Scarpetta novel isn't anything like the previous ones. All the characters are angry, the ""villian"" isn't very villianous, the 3rd person POV is awkward, the plot is muddled and twisted and the ending is anemic. Come on, where is the quality books that Patricia Cornwell used to write?"
1,am i missing something?,"i never finished the book. what a slow read. i ,thankfully, got it from the library. 3 weeks were allotted to read the book. i returned the book unfinished.i purchased cornwells first 4 books. they were good reads. now i get her books from the library because they are not worth the money."
1,horrible writing,this has to be the worst book patricia cornwell has ever written. luckily i obtained from library and did not waste my money. my recommendation is not to buy.
3,Ho-Hum,"I'm about halfway through this lengthy Scarpetta novel, and at this point, I don't really care if I get back to finish it anytime soon. This is pretty unusual since I usually can't put a good Cornwell story down until it's done. The author has chosen an odd 3rd person style for this book which I find pretty annoying. Also, the venerable Kay Scarpetta is not as present in this story as usual--her personality is diluted in a curious way that leaves me unengaged. If you like Kay Scarpetta, I suggest you re-read (or newly discover) ""Post Mortem"" or ""The Body Farm""."
1,This is so sad ...,"To those of you new to Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta series, read the first nine books. Those books have some of the best writing and story telling that you'll come across in this genre of literature. Stay away from the last three books, including this one. They're not worth the money they cost, or the time spent in muddling through them.To those of you who are long-time fans of this series, I'm leaving your ranks. I don't think Kay is coming back, and I'm saddened to see the changes in Lucy and Marino. They're just not believable characters anymore. And the stories are no longer well plotted. But, worst of all, they're no longer interesting."
2,Bait and Switch? Ya think??!,"I anticipated this was going to be a REAL Scarpetta novel, back to the GOOD stuff, at last!! But no such luck! The odd switch to 3rd person for Scarpetta means she's no longer narrating, and right there you have a huge loss! Scarpetta said this, Scarpetta said that, etc., etc., etc., it's just far less interesting. I think even the lightweight plot could have been saved by PC using her winning formula of having Scarpetta doing her usual narration! I can't fathom why a terrific writer like PC would have so little regard for her fans as to mess with what we have grown to expect from her. If she's trying to drive her readership away, then just keep disappointing us like this! I threw BLOWFLY in the garbage, where it belonged, after reading just 20 pages! I'm going to finish TRACE before I donate it to the Thrift Shop. But I'm just going to have to deal with the fact that the Scarpetta series is really over now. Sad, but true!"
1,Sadly disappointed,"I ordered Trace from my book guild hoping as I did with Blowfly that it would be a ""good read"". Sadly, I was disappointed and will not buy anymore of her books. My daughter is also reading it and I told her not to waste her time. I told her I was going to check the reviews online to see if others felt the way I did and they absolutely do. If I had her website address I would write her and tell her to stop writing novels. There was no plot to this story and the linking together of so many people and places was unbelievable. Trace was a good title because there's only a trace of a story. If I had the choice to rate this a minus number I certainly would. I feel I have wasted $15."
1,Kay is lost???,"I have read all of the Scarpetta books and this is just horrible. It was taking place in 3 different states, which would have been fine, had there been a real story. Blowfly wasn't that good, but I thought the people would all be pulled together for this one. We still don't know the status of Benton and Kay, and after reading this book, who really cares? Where is the wolf? After reading trace, I really don't care. What happened to the real Lucy? How did Marino quit smoking and drinking? This book lost all of their personalities. I usually read the Scarpetta books in 2 day (I work 9 Hours and have 2 boys to do homework). It took me 5 days to read this one when I was home alone the most part. It was really boring. I would prefer that Kay was put to rest than to read more of that."
1,Don't Waste your money or Time. Too bad.,Boring. I used to love to read Cornwell's books. I am done. The last few have been the pits. Boring is the understatement. This one never moved any where. I never quit reading books but did with this one. I was more than half way through the book and GAVE UP. Solve a mystery not a personal issue.
1,Glad it was over,"I used to buy Cornwell in hardback, now I don't buy them at all since the last few have been such let downs. The reason I found this latest so tedious is that the characters are too abnormal to be real. Between the psychotic serial killers are a bunch of seriously disturbed folks. Ms. Cornwell: Most people in this world function a whole lot better than those in your latest books. Also, please do not neglect to tie up so many story lines in your next book if indeed you write another book. So what DID happen in the political mess of the ME's office with Dr. Marcus ( surprise! another mental wacko!)Did she ever speak with Fielding? If Lucy is so dang smart, why is she so stupid? I just wish these compelling characters were not all self destructing, I expected better."
1,I have to admit that,"I am a fool for once more being lured to buying a Scarpetta book. Why does Cornwell insist on writing about her? There is no more inspiration, there is no more life, there is no more hope and there is no more redemption for that once-wonderful-now-a-caricature lady. Some claim here that Cornwell returned to her former form. Don't make me laugh! She had lost everything in fiction world five years ago and she reached the zenith of silliness when she published Isle of Dogs. Now she is trying to do the same thing with the Scarpetta series, making herself a pity caricature of a once-respected author. No more Cornwell for me: Neither from the bookseller nor from the library. If you are wise enough, you will do the same. Let her stop feeding these silly things into us under the name of ""novel"""
1,pls save cornwell!!!!,I want to cry in desperation. I thought the follow up to Blow fly would somehow redeem the Scarpetta series but I was grossly mistaken. Trace is worst. What's wrong with Lucy? I thought it would be her and Nic but now she has a psycho for a girlfriend. How could someone as smart as her could do the most stupid of things? What was Cornwell thinking when she was writing Trace? I used to be proud of having read her novels but now I'm no longer sure she still has the gift of good writing. All of the characters I've grown to love since reading Postmortem are so different now that I just feel depressed reading about them.
2,Trace,"This book is definitely not worth buying. While Scarpetta skill returns a bit in Trace, it is not enough to carry the wispy plot. Marino has become a completely reinvented character. Anyone who read the earlier books will not recognize him. I agree that Ms Cornwell should read her earlier work. Lucy is a complete enigma in this story. What is the point of including her?"
1,Worst Scarpetta ever,I was so disappointed with this book. I am sorry I spent time reading it. I kept waiting for it to get better and it never did. There were too many subplots that never were tied up. I am through with Cornwell. Her characters are so unhappy and angry. Every page was a real downer. Don't waste your time. Read Kathy Reichs instead.
3,Trace,"I have so enjoyed Patricia Cornwell's Scarpetta series, but they are not as good a read as they once were. The ending always seemed rushed."
5,Trace,I really loved the book. It is deffinitely another Great Patricia Cornwell mystery. I hope she continues for a long time
2,Not Her Best,Somehow Cornwell has gotten away from the basic Scarpetta thriller.There is too much of her niece in this one. The ending is weak. I usually love her work. This one was disappointing.
3,A bit disappointed,"I was actually a bit disappointed in this latest installment from Cornwell. It left me feeling a bit cheated. Where is the drama and suspense that I have come to know and love from Patricia Cornwell? There was no exciting chase or uncovering of some nasty character. Maybe she is going to lead up to something of that nature in the next book, I don't know. Of course, I read every single word but I feel that I could have skipped a whole bunch and never missed any of the so-called plot. She is without a doubt my favorite writer but I hope her next book is better. If not, I may just have to move on to something more exciting.:("
3,Adequate.,"It entertained me for a few days but it was empty and largely not very impressive. The finish was perfunctory at best, and it felt like there was just about no resolution. The best part of the wole book was Marino's storyline. In fact, Marino and Scarpetta are the only characters that remain likable in this series.Bottom line: Don't go out of your way for this book, but if you happen to have it on hand - it won't make you roll your eyes that much."
2,Barely a trace of the old Cornwell,"This book is not bad, just disappointing. She really has not written a good book since Point of Origin. It seems Ms. Cornwell has gotten tired of Scarpetta and as a reader I am exhausted as well. I won't bore you with a synopsis of the book, but take my word for it, this is not her best work. As an avid reader of her Scarpetta books, I can honestly say I don't care about these characters anymore, especially Lucy; please Patrica kill her off. This character is so obtuse, who can believe she is a genius; and a hot one at that. What's next Lucy as President-Super Model-Bill Gates; GIVE ME A BREAK, and am I the only one that shivers at the thought that Marino could be a composite of policeman Cornwell knew? How revolting. Maybe it's time for Cornwell to give up Scarpetta, she obviously doesn't like her anymore and I'm not sure she likes her readers much either... the feeling is mutual."
1,You've Got To Be Kidding...,"How could an author actually write a book worse than Isle of Dogs? Yes, Patricia Cornwell has exceeded all expectations in that area! I got excited when I saw the new release! It was quickly extinguished when I started reading. For whatever reason, this book shifts from first to third person and past to present tense at a nauseating clip. I too felt like there must be a book missing between this and BlowFly.An author once on my favorite list is slipping into the ""land of .50 cent book-dom"". I'm not even sure I could re-sell the hardcover copy for that.I'm sticking to Tess Gerritsen and Lisa Scottoline from here on out - Patricia Cornwell has disappointed this faithful reader one time too many."
1,Terribly disappointing!,I've read several Patricia Cornwell novels and was excited to read this one. But Trace is a complete disappointment! It doesn't even resemble her previous writing. It's hard to believe it's the same author. The book leaves MANY unanswered questions and unresolved plot lines. It almost feels like she got bored with a particular character or scenario and just stopped! It's sloppy and undeveloped.
1,Disappointed fan!,"I have been a fan of Patricia Cornwell's character, Kay Scarpetta, for many years. I tried reading her other books and did not find them appealing, so when the most recent Kay novels came out I was thrilled! However, Blowfly was so bad, I had to double check to make sure someone hadn't glued a fake cover on a dime store novel. Then Trace came out and my curiosity got the better of me. I thought that Ms. Cornwell's connection with Kay may have needed some warming up, and that Trace would get back on track. Unfortunatly, I was wrong. The book began with all the standard alignment of characters and the lay out of the facts so they could be drawn together with excitement and an almost ""Holmes"" way of solving the problem, however this ended so quickly I searched the papers to see if perhaps Patricia Cornwell had died and the book was published unfinished! Very disappointing with very few loose ends tied up. Edgar Allen Pogue may still be out there for all I know!"
1,Depressingly awful,"This is definitely the last book in the Kay Scarpetta series that I will ever read. It's just all too depressing, too detailed in the most gruesome way (I DON'T want to know that the internal organs of a dead body turn into a sludgy soup in the autopsy bag), and I see no point in reading something that makes me feel dirty and crawly! The new M.E.who replaced Scarpetta in Virginia is a psycopathic wacko who is out to bring her down...yeah, yeah, yeah! And so it continues.. but not for me."
5,Awesome as usual,Cornwell is a suspenseful author that keeps you gripped to the pages the whole read! She makes you question at every turn... Awesome book just like the last!
4,Loved It!,Another great Scarpetta novel! I love reading about their lives as well as solving the crime. Can't wait for the next one!
3,Review of Trace (A Scarpetta Novel),"I had not read a Scarpetta novel in quite some time and I must say that I enjoyed the fact that the main characters were still involved in the series. What was not so great was that Scarpetta and company were all very predictable in their ways, especially the fact that they all seem miserable throughout the book. I realize that Scarpetta novels have a certain theme (death, and in most cases an unusual death or two), that said can't the characters have a little fun every now and then and shake off some of their previous ways (Scarpetta and Benton never being able to be together and Scarpetta constantly angry about it) and not be so unhappy throughout the novel?"
1,Trace,Not worth reading. Weak story line with incomplete ending. One is a higher rating than this book deserves. Cornwell books just don't have the substance they once had in her earlier writings.
1,A Trace of Disappointment...again....,"Like so many of the other reviewers I was disappointed with her new novel Trace, that I was eagerly anticipating. Too many backstories, POV was confusing and overall the story line was not the best. I own every book and I am hoping Cornwell gets over this hump."
3,"Well, it was better than Blow Fly","Trace was better than Blow Fly, but that's not saying much. It was okay. If you like the genre check out James Patterson or Matthew Farrell or Jeffrey Deaver. Let's give Patricia some time to sit back and refocus."
3,Is Cornwell losing interest in her franchise?,"This book reads as if written, as Robert A. Heinlein used to say, to ""pay the mortgage."" Obviously, Cornwell is now a very wealthy woman, who spent $5Million of her own money on the Jack the Ripper mystery. Maybe she's a bit underdeposited at the bank after that expenditure? Clearly, she's not taking the interest or pains she used to with her books, just kind of writing on automatic pilot.And the Lucy character? Please. Being a successful P.I. is very largely a people business, yet Lucy keeps misjudging these rejects she climbs into bed with? And never learns? Yet is making enough cash as a P.I. to buy a $10Million mansion. And two Ferraris.Memo to Cornwell: either smarten Lucy up, or dump her for someone we can care about."
2,Not Ms. Cornwell's best.,I was very disappointed in this book. It seemed to jump around and I had trouble following the storyline.Eileen
1,It's all about me me me,"Gone are the suspense filled plots that made it easy to forget that the stories main character is a self centered narcissist. Cornwell's characters, even the beloved ones, seem to have only one role, as the less valuable sidekick to Scarpetta who spends an extrordinary amount of her time musing over the many people that she believes are 'out to get her', jealous of her and always, more flawed than she is. Her need to be seen as superior to all others as well as her obvious distaste for men, are not enough plot to keep this reader interested."
1,Who wrote this???,"It's so disappointing that Cornwell has either forgotten how to write or that she's sold out and got someone else to write for her. This book is so disorganized and boring that I realized at page 200 that nothing much had developed. It was only towards the end that things sort of came together, with a weak ending.It seems as though a lot of the authors that have made it big feel that they're above getting any editorial feedback on their work and churn out crap. I'm sorry to say that Cornwell has joined the ranks of Parker and Clancy in this regard."
2,BORING BORING BORING,"I was so excited to finally read this, it usually only takes me a day to rip through her books. This time was much different. I had to force myself to read. Lucy and Marino are such great characters (or used to be) And now its just sad to see them deteriorate. I was very disapointed, I went back and reread Cruel And Unusual just to make myself feel better.Dont waste your money!"
2,Maybe it is time to forget about Kay Scarpetta...,"Again. Another poor book by Patricia Cornwell. I anticipated better after the disapointment of Blow Fly. This was just another bad book. Way too much Lucy - who continues to be an unlikable character. Lcuy is smart, Lucy is great, who cares about Lucy??? Marino seems at his worse and Benton is just boring. She offers up some new characters that are underdeveloped - a new ME and a employee of Lucy's...you are just left saying ""huh?"" about both of them. And where is our Kay?? This character is dull and boring. Cornwell needs to get back to her roots and read some of her first books to get back in to the swing of things. I hesitate to read another Scarpetta mystery in the future..."
1,Scarpetta needs to be put to Sleep.....,I remember the days when I couldn't wait for another Scarpetta adventure! But what the heck is going on? I was very excited to start reading Trace since the Blow Fly disaster I couldn't even finish. But that same feeling came back not too far into this book. I kept wondering where the story was actually going if anywhere. Characters just disappeared off the face of the earth. I have to say I will really think twice before I buy another Scarpetta book.
1,Boring!,"Cornwell's first novels (not Scarpetta) were really rather boring and I couldn't finish them. The Scarpetta novels really built up into some incredible writing and several were quite good and entertaining, but now I believe Cornwell has run out of good new plot lines. Unfortunately, I found this novel as dull as her originals before she learned to really write. Time for a break. I'm not buying anymore of them."
2,The ending reads like Cornwell got bored or ran up against her publishers deadline.,"My one complaint about this book, besides her increasingly negative tone towards her own characters, is that there is NO ending. It just stops. Within a handful of pages, Cornwell wraps up all the story lines without any real payoff at all. Pitiful! It was clear who did the crimes, so couldn't she have taken a little time to actually write an ending that has at least some substance? I was very disappointed."
1,Not a good read for Scarpetta fans,"Very disappointing read especially for fans of Kay Scarpetta. Not a great story easy to figure out who is the villian in this one. Written differently than other books by Cronwell, thoughts of main characters differs from past actions and past insight into personalities."
1,Without a trace or reason,"This is the last Cornwell book I will read. As a reader who devoured the earliest Scarpetta books, I've given the latest books every chance I could. No more. My thoughts on this one are: 1) She let her 12 year-old neice write it as a lark, 2) she remembered the night before the deadline that she had a book due or 3)she's bored to death with it all and trying to get out of her contract.... If it is #3, I wish her the best of luck."
1,400 Pages of Fluff,"I closed the cover of the book after finishing it and thought to myself, ""what do I know about Kay, Lucy, Benton, and Marino that I didn't know 400 pages ago?"" Answer: Nothing. Although, I did know that I didn't much care anymore. I'm not sure what this book was supposed to be but I can't imagine ""disappointing"" was on Ms. Cornwell's list of prefered critical adjectives."
3,Disappointing,"""Where oh where has PC gone? Where oh where has she gone""?This definitly not one of PC's better Scarpetta book's. What a disappointment. If your looking foward to the next Scarpetta book don't look here. Not worth it. The book goes no where. As you read you get the feeling that PC was in a hurry to get this book done. No creativity,No thrill, No thought.I will think twice about the next PC book I read if I read any."
2,Patricia Cornwell may be losing her edge.....,"I eagerly read this book as soon as I received it and finished it in less than a day. While I have been a Scarpetta fan since the first book came out, ""Blowfly"" and now ""Trace"" have both left me wanting. ""Trace"" is a good read but I don't think it is on the same superior level Ms. Cornwell's earlier works were on. I was very frustrated with the lack of procedural work in this book and the return of Scarpetta to her old stomping grounds fell flat. The ending seemed rushed (and anticlimactic) and left me wondering what the heck just happened. I am afraid I have either outgrown Ms. Cornwell or she has moved on to other projects, leaving Kay Scarpetta floundering."
2,Pointless plot with miserable and depressed characters,"Patricia Cornwell is one of my favorite authors, but lighten up! Next time I want to wallow in something this depressing I'll just lock myself in a dark room and repeat over and over ""life sucks and then you die"". At least the mantra gets to the point."
2,Cornwell misses audience,"I presumed that ""Trace"" was to continue the reader's relationship with the popular and beloved Kay Scarpetta. Unfortunately, Cornwell has lost her connection with fans. She has watered down Scarpetta and turned her into a cliche. The characters and subplot are disjointed and not likeable. Cornwell repeats the same tired descriptions of her charcters over and over again. A couple of the subplots were bizarre and made me wonder what in the world Cornwell was even thinking of when writing them. Maybe it is time for Kay Scarpetta to move on taking her tired vendettas with her."
1,Who's doing the ghost writing?,This isn't the Kay Scarpetti I've enjoyed for years. A waste of time and money. Continued to read thinking it would get better -it didn't.
2,Chronic depression...,"I won't summarize the plot of the latest Kay Scarpetta story; others do the summarizing quite well. I will say that this is probably the last Kay Scarpetta story I will read. This woman is so chronically depressed, I get depressed reading about her life and problems! The plotting of the first 3 or 4 novels in this series was fascinating enough to offset her negative personality fairly well. But at this point, I find myself surprised that she hasn't committed suicide yet. Even a Medical Examiner must have SOME light moments in her life, but not our Kay. I think she needs (1) a good shrink, and (2) a new line of work not connected to dead people. Despite all the forensics most of us find so fascinating these days, reading fiction is - or should be - mainly for entertainment. This is not entertaining."
3,my first Scarpetta mystery,"In this latest Scarpetta tale, amazing crime-solving sleuth Kay Scarpetta must solve the murders of a young girl when she has so little to go on, and a killer who wants to get her as much as she wants him caught. We see Kay back in the lab this time, working her forensic magic. But I found myself getting side-tracked from the main story and somewhat bored. I also had important unanswered questions by the end of the novel. But if you're hooked on the series, you may still find this one worth reading. This was my first Scarpetta novel, so I hope I'd like one of the earlier ones much better."
2,"Bad, really bad","This novel starts off slow and then just runs out of what little steam it began with. The characters are progressively unappealing and Cornwell slides more and more right wing, if not down right racist, commentary into her books. The supposedly loveable Marino has to stop himself from saying he takes his coffee like his women ""white"" and the thinly veiled comments about inner city dwellers is likewise mean spirited. Frankly, by the end of this book I did not care if they all died in a multi- car wreck, and I doubt anyone else did either."
2,disappointed and confused,I recall an earlier Kay Scarpetta novel that dealt with the agonizing death of Wesley Benton. I remember feeling devastated by that death. Am I the only one who is wondering how he magically appeared in Trace? Did I miss something? I can't shake the feeling that Patricia Cornwell became a little lazy by bringing him back without an explanation - it was almost like reading a soap opera although even they offer an explanation as to how the dead are reincarnated. I was disappointed in this book - I found it to be anticlimatic and missed the first person view of Kay Scarpetta.
1,Kay Scarpetta Must Die,"Christie did it to Hercules, Doyle did it to Holmes. Kay's time has come. Somewhere, somehow a lovely, exciting, wonderful series created from the heart of PC has become hack work driven by Patricia Cornwell, Inc. This, I'm afraid, is the last PC novel I'll ever buy."
2,Not Stiff Enough,"Brush has no body to it, it is Not Stiff Enough. Went back to the local ACO and found they sell a really good foam brush made by Jen MFG (Made in USA)...just ordered these now."
3,"Too much with automation and 1960s ""Death of God"" issue.","Covers a wide range of Western literature and political issues. Harrington says that our (1960s) society in collective, so why not have socialism which would make the collective society democratic? It is from the labor unions joining with middle class liberals, and Afro-Americans (then called Negros) that this form of free socialism can come about. This is a restatement of the views of civil rights leaders Bayard Rustin and A. Philip Randolph. If only their ideas had been followed at the time."
3,Needs work.,"The parts of the book dealing with Sanchin and Tensho kata are useful if you have never examined them carefully. The author provides useful interpretations and details for karate students. Regretfully the author omits an entire area of the training in the aforementioned kata, namely internal training, which is the essence of these kata. The author would be well advised to research qi gong training, as would any reader who is determined to study these kata seriously."
2,2 stars for the price,"Really good for listening audio books, unfortunately nothing else. Bought me 2 pairs for a trip. Both are absolutely the same in quality. 2 stars just for the price and a cute case they comes with ;)"
1,Lousy,One channel stopped working a month after I bought them. It wasn't the connector because jiggling the connector had no effect. I treat my earphones well and have never had this problem before.
3,It's okay,"I bought several pieces based on clearance pricing. The color scheme or hand painting or overall quality isn't the best, but it will serve its holiday purpose. It's one of those items that if it gets broken, no real loss, therefore making it great for parties."
4,"Really filling, not much coconut flavor","I love coconut so I thought a product that wasn't too sweet and was mostly coconut would be a great alternative to other snacks. These bars are really filling, slightly greasy and definitely not too sweet. They don't taste like coconut candy at all. I wish the coconut flavor was more pronounced but perhaps it is not because it is all natural and hasn't been enhanced by artificial flavor. It is an ok snack but doesn't really satisfy the desire for coconut."
1,Grows moldy way before expiration date,"I bought these on subscribe and save, last year. I ate them occasionally and put the new arrivals in a cool dry place for storage thinking they would still be good up to their expiration date. I had to throw away two boxes of these because they went bad and moldy. Another box I sealed in a ziplock storage bag and it was not visibly moldy but smells and tastes off (like cough syrup) compared to fresh ones. So even when they are put in additional sealing and stored properly, they go bad far before their expiration date."
5,A great natural sweet treat!,"Oskri has truly covered all the bases with this delicious treat. Just the right balance of texture, sweetness(using a natural sweetener) and overall flavor. All organic ingredients. Kosher. A tremendous amount of fiber.I had been buying the bar locally, at prices ranging from 99 cents to a dollar and 70 cents. The Amazon price totaled around 75 cents. What a deal! Of course, to get that price, I had to buy in bulk. Since I'm essentially addicted to one of these a day, that didn't pose a problem.I also bought a box of the mango and pineapple varieties. The mango bar is also mouth-wateringly delicious, but more sweet. The pineapple variety is sticky-sweet, and loaded with rice sweetener syrup..so much so that the bar flops over and falls apart as you're eating it. The flavor is so concentrated that I'd suggest eating it like a delicacy and splitting it with a friend."
3,"The older they get, the harder they get","I love these bars. They are great to travel with and to keep in your purse when hunger pains hit (and nothing healthy or gluten-free is available). But, even with an expiration date almost two years out when I purchased them, these bars start getting hard after a year."
1,Watch those slippery wrappers!,"This is a delicious little snack but may slip out of your hands due to leaking wrappers. The oil is so prevalent that the outside of the individual bar is wet with the oil and it also leaks on the outside box/container. Now that I've covered the messiness, let's address the healthiness. The calorie content is far too high to eat them everyday, but if you don't they will spoil due to the leaky wrapper. Some of them are pretty dried out by the time you get to them and others are two moist to even hold up until the individual bar can be eaten. Don't think I'll be reordering."
1,Inedible within month of receipt,"As mentioned in another review, the package arrived oily and became moldy in less than a month. This may just be a seasonal problem, but buyer beware!"
4,"Excellent, but...","If you like coconut, this is an excellent choice; chewy organic flakes, not too sweet. Makes a great snack, or as a quick energy fuel-bar. The only negative is that the coconut oil in these packages seems to seep thru the wrapper, especially in hot weather. I had mine in my kitchen cabinet, but then had to refrigerate them during a hot spell. They are the right size and the price for a box of 18 was great, even better when purchased thru Amazon.com with the free shipping!"
2,Spoiled within 3 days,"When they first arrived, they tasted very good. But, do to poor packaging the heat made oil come out of all the individual packages. Then, within 3 days, horrible mold grew on all the bars."
5,Moist and delicious,I took a chance and ordered the box of coconut bars- now I'm wondering if that'll be enough to last the week. These are moist and natural coconut bars- no odd creamy additives or anything that detracts from the oh so perfect coconut. It's just coconut and rice syrup and nothing else. It's moist and chewy- not mealy at all. It's a bit oily but that's natural coconut for you.I just finished one and am now eying the box and figuring out how long I should wait before eating another. These are truly simple goodness.
2,Not happy with product that was delivered,I had had the product before so knew what I was getting. I did find a savings on Amazon so decided to buy it. I was not exactly satisfied when I opened the box as the individual packages were oily (from the coconut oil). That signifies either Amazon is not storing these properly or during shipping their is a drastic change in temperature. The product ended up tasting altered so pitche them.
4,Great condition,"This book was in really good condition, this was for my modern language class and I also enjoyed reading it, and I got it quickly thanks"
3,its stoopid alright,its umm.. odd.. thought it was gonna be something different.. but some parts get the job done.. others.. get fast forwarded through.. but isnt that what porn is about?..
3,it ws ok,"tho i lov pitbull and anything he does, this is not really his story. this ws a snyopsis in the life of. the title indicates a bio and this was anything but. i thought i ws going to see where he grew up, his beginnings, interviews from his childhood. his music wsnt even played. they spoked about some of his major early hits but it wasnt heard. again, tho i lov pitbull this ws a let down."
4,Lively stories - how odd for modern literature!,"It's possible to feel one is wandering in a cold, mathematical wasteland when reading stories by contemporary writers. How nice to find an anthology of stories that are engaging, provocative, and not completely self-absorbed. Ok, a couple of the writers in the book are self-absorbed, but there are stories by all sorts of other authors, some I'd heard of, some I hadn't, that made me laugh, worry, think about the world, and want to pass the book on. In a literary world where either sullen math or indulgent memoir (or a combination of the two) seems to rule, Juncture is a welcome oddity - you'll think about some of the stories for days and days afterwards and not be pissed off as I usually am."
4,why?,"Some one explain to me why the The Black keys are so big, and the NMAS go about their business and get unnoticed. I understand the TBK's are more gargage than the blues, blues-rock inclined sound of the All-Stars. The NAMS's are certainly less monotomous than the The Black Keys can be. Just look at the ALL_Stars as a perfect example of the best garage blues rock band out there now. Kudos guys.Hope you get famous.Great party record too. It will be more fun if you play this in place of El Camino."
3,"and a half stars. some songs are pretty good, but 51 Phantom is better","I've seen north mississippi allstars live a few times the best being memphis in may 2005 during sunset on the missippi river. I got electric blue watermelon first, really loved it for a couple of times but then ran across 51 phantom later on. man that one is way more heavy down south blues, and had less of the silliar songs. ( didn't like hurry up sunrise, or stompin' my feet, or deep blue sea,) the rest were ok.to wrap it up, move onto polaris or 51 phantom, or even shake hands with shorty, or polarisrank 1) 51 Phantom 2)shake hands with shorty 3)Polaris 4) Electric Blue Watermelon"
4,Eclectic Blue Watermelon,"This cd is such a breath of fresh air from NMA's last studio release, Polaris. Their Hill city revue, live from Bonnaroo highlighted their live experiance through an amazing array of guest musicians and great jamming. Electric Blue Watermelon does the same thing for a studio album. Great guest musicians like Lucinda Williams and Robert Randolf guest star and rock out this album. The blues is back here, and the NMA's just rock out through the whole cd dishing out all kinds of great blues jams: the fast slide based blues, folky blues, foot stompin blues, and of course some Allman brothers influenced songs that are to say the least, great. The North Mississippi Allstars rekindle good old fashioned blues rooted rock and roll music that is here to stay. four and a half stars."
2,Mangiamo! Let's Eat,I love his other books but this one was a disappointment. Not a lot of good recipes. More about his family than recipes.
5,Incredible Virtuosity,"Is there a more perfect brass performer than Christian Lindberg? Listen to this recording, then ask yourself who might compete for the prize. Yet for all its technical brilliance--which is huge--LIndberg's musicianship lies finally in his love for the music and his exuberant joy in its playing. Most highly recommended."
2,Hickey doesn't tell all & doesn't explain why he remained,"As one who lived through many of the scenes depicted here I grew tired of Gerald Hickey's slowness in supposedly coming late to realize that the CIA, Pentagon, Special Forces, White House and Rand wasn't going to use his informaiton for peace. All of us who were there knew this was the case, why didn't he? He was betrayed so many times early on in this book that it seems obvious that his research was never going to be used for peace, so it was instead used for war."
1,Not Good,My hot coffee turned lukewarm 10 minutes after I poured it.Retained odors. I am currently looking for a replacement.
2,practicality,PRODUCT IS BASICLLY USELESS. COLD BEVERAGES CAUSE THE PRODUCT SWEAT WAY TO MUCH. HOT BEVERAGES TURN COLD IN MINUTES.Highwave Jomondo SL White 24 Oz
5,Russian Viola At Its Best,"This is an unusual compilation of Russian composers' pieces for viola solo.It inspired me to buy the sheet music for some of the pieces when I first purchased the recording.I recommend this for anyone beginning a collection of music cds, whether they play viola or another instrument. Nobuko does some great interpretation on all the pieces, and she plays passionately. She gives them unusual life. I liked the Rubenstein and Glinka particularly."
3,Freud rabbet,"The cutting tool part of the set appears very well made and I didn't have any problems cutting rabbets in Maple.I gave it 3 stars for the reasons a.The 1/4 inch rabbet combination actually gives a 3/16 inch rabbet, and there appears to be no combination for 1/4 inch,b. using the assembly per the instruction sheet thebearing was touching the cutting edge (I ended up using the large spacer), and c. There are a lots of small parts and if the plastic package had feet molded in it along with all of the small compartments it would stand level...instead it tends to fall on it's side.I suggest consider CMT another good brand."
3,One problem...,"Generally this set has been great. I've used them in MDF to take out a 1/4"" and it's worked well.Recently I discovered a problem though... The flush cut bearing has enough play that it contacts the top of the bit if the workpiece is pressed against it. I discovered this after I noticed flakes of aluminum in the dust on my bench. This doesn't happen with any of the other bearings.I haven't contacted Freud about this yet, so this may be flaw in this particular unit."
5,Quality router bit,This is an excellent quality router bit that cuts through oak wood with a clean cut revealing the sharpness of the tool.
1,Hard to Bear,"I was very frustrated to find that parts for the first two setups I needed didn't fit or parts were apparently missing. For the 1/4"" rabbet setup, the 5/16"" reducers are too large to fit into the 7/8"" bearing. Where's their quality control? For another setup the 3/8"" and 1/2"" step washers are missing or don't fit."
1,Frued Multi-Rabbeting Bit Set,"As did one of your other reviewers, I also was not able to fit the 5/16"" reducers into the 7/8"" pilot bearing needed to cut 1/4"" rabbets. I returned the set to the vendor who tried two other kits and experienced the same problem. I would only recommend purchase of this kit after confirming proper fit of all reducers."
2,Buyer Beware,The Multi-Rabbeting Bit Set looks like a good idea on paper but it's not. If all you had to keep track of was the bearings it would be ok but the set comes with an assortment of reducer collars to make the bearings fit. These tiny collars are likely to be quickly lost rendering the system useless.
4,I think it has improved!,I read all the review in Amazon.com about this bit and hesitated to order it. I've had good luck with all the Freud blades in the past so I gave it a try despite all the bad reviews. I put the bit to test as soon as it arrived. Everything fit perfectly. Cut was very good and it is all made in Italy. There is nothing written on the bearing as one reader mentioned that it was made in China. I think may be because of the bad reviews Freud might have made improvement. One thing I still don't know it how long it will last. But looking at fit and finish it looks like a good product.
3,A little disappointing.,"I expected this to be a facinating book that would teach me about how the terrorists think and that it would detail the great psycological struggles that must go on between the interrogators and the men who are incarcerated for year after year in the prisons in Afghanistan. Clearly it could have been that, but for whatever reason the authors chose to not include more than superficial details of their interractions with the al-Qaeda and Taliban operatives they must have encountered. Obviously many details would need to be kept secret, but I beleive the real human story of these interrogations remains to be told. Hopefully we will get the chance to read that one day."
2,"Would be a compelling book, if edited or better-written","I bought this book at a dollar store because I wanted to learn more about Al Quaeda and how U.S. interrogation is conducted.I am reading it with a pen and careful attention, only because I'm intensely interested in its content.Otherwise, I would throw the book away.If edited or re-written, it would be a brilliant book.In its present form, it's difficult to read.Very unfortunate--such an important subject."
2,The Army Wants to Join You! A Politically Correct Fable.,God help us all if this is what the army has become. I lost count of how many times Mackey made mention of his quest to protect the Muslim prisoners from any distress. Even better is the revelation of the army guys and gals taking the youngster Taliban and al Queda under their wings and nurturing them. It's all very touching. I wonder if I can flush this book down the toilet? hmmmm
5,Great Book for those interested in the Facts!,I love this book not only because it is a really great read but because of the accuracy of the content.
4,Interesting insight into military interrogation,"This book gives a lot of great insight into our military operations in Afghanistan and the challenges our troops face. These are guys, called back into active duty from the humdrum of every day life, who speak Arabic and Farsi with a Berlin's guide in one hand, going up against the most hardened prisoners in the world. They are stretched to the breaking point, exposed to the elements, working 16 hours a day, and learning on the fly how to interrogate in the strange new world of borderless conflicts and international jihad while juggling the latest spin on the geneva conventions.The writing was crisp and the action flowed smoothly. I felt the CIA bashing was a little overboard at times (gee, there hasn't been any bad blood between the Pentagon and the CIA lately, has there???) but otherwise this was an objective and informative first hand glimpse into the early days of the war on terror."
5,Great BED!,I searched a long time after seeing this bed in an expensive furniture store that wouldn't sell the bed because it was for display only. They didn't know where it came from but had gotten tons of requests to buy the bed and wouldn't sell it. I was shocked to see the price (the store I saw it in could have gotten away with selling it for 3 times that) and the quality is great. I am very happy with my purchase.
2,Bed Frame missing pieces!!!!,"So the headboard and footboard are perfect, just what I expected.....However the bed frame is missing two gliders! I ordered a queen, and the frame requires a middle beam, which came with it, but without the foot gliders!!!! >:O So basically my middle beam was just hanging in there in mid air..... till I sat on the bed and of course it fell off! I had to temporarily put some cardboard from the box and mount it up to be 4"" inches high so the beam can actually stay in place. I called amazon to report the problem and now they want to give me a credit to repurchase it and then return the existing one! I am not looking forward to this exchange!!!!"
2,Non standard size frame,"I bought the bed for my daughter. The twin bed frame seems have good quality. But the frame is 4-6"" inch longer than twin mattress or box I can get. The bed frame is 80"" long, but normally twin mattress and spring box is about 74"". I do not understand why this bed is designed in this way. I am thinking of returning the bed but the whole package materials have been disposed. Not a good experience!"
5,In house pre-school,"I really recommend this for young children. It teaches them patience, and listening skills that will increase their attention span. My daughter is 3 and enjoys it very much. Note she is a little young for it, but I wanted to start her early and she plays on the Disney web site so much I decided to broden her learning. Since I have a 1yr old and in school now I don't sit and teach her as much as I used to and I wanted to fill in that gap in a way she will enjoy.If you plan to home school like me this is a good way to start your children out. I'm going back to school to be more prepared to home school my children and this is great to prepare them.As they get older I will continue to buy this product for the upper grade levels."
3,Not for Mac's,This software works nicely at my parents PC household but not at all in our Mac house. I've found several websites that work just as well and are recommended by our preschool and elementary school. Again the software works well and keeps younger children interested on PC's but I would not recommend this for Mac owners.
3,Not great; has Mac problems,"Not bad, not great. My son (3.5 years) is entertained and it is helping him with his computer skills; however, the software has problems on our Mac--the computer my son uses. In the future, I'll probably look for something that is solely created for the Mac rather than something that can be used on anything (doubt it was really created to use the Mac's resources effectively and efficiently)."
2,A middling first rate account,"This book is Rose's day by day account of his record breaking 1985 season. The most unintentionally funny moment is when he mentions being tempted to go to the dogtrack while on a road trip but ultimately containing his urges. Yeah, right!"
4,Henry the Fourth,"The story is simple enough for 1st graders to read, and funny enough for them to want to read it. The illustrations are bright, colorful, and inviting. I read this story to 1st graders, and then reviewed the story with them. They liked the dogs and their owners, and could easily relate to me their ordinal number. After we read through it once I had the children take turns being the dogs and their classmates put them in the proper order. This is a great way to introduce ordinal numbers, and to review the concept if you have already introduced the concept. The back of the book contains several ideas for extending the concepts in this story. I recommend this book for kindergarten and first grade students."
5,Loved It!,I wish I would have had something like this when I first started learning math! My four year old daughter loves being able to see the ideas and concepts and it really helps her understand better.
2,Not what I was expecting...,I was hoping for some detailed information about Home based businesses and all the other subjects the title contains. I was quite disappointed. The chapter on home businesses more or less convinces you it is a waste of time and not to do it. Very disheartening. This book was not informative to me in any way. I agree with the previous review that said there is better info for free on the web.We all have our personal tatses for authors. This author is well intentioned but I do not like her writing style. She is hard to follow and very bland.
1,Not worth the paper that its printed on.,"Many of the chapters of this book simply include facts. These chapters are of use to anyone interested in studying Russia. However, other chapters concerning topics such as mafia, politics, etc. are either totally inaccurate or not true. Having lived in Moscow for three years studying Russian foreign policy while managing an office, I strongly urge anyone interested in Russian business to ""not purchase this book."" If you want an accurate account of Russian politics and economy, read The Coming Russian Boom by Layard"
1,"WARNING! Overlabeled, actually packed for 2010!","I just received this product and placed it in intended area of garden. On returning to the porch, I took a closer look at the label. I was surprised to see that multiple quality labels had been applied, three in total.I had a bad feeling about this, so I removed all three labels from the bag. Clear as day, the lowest label, that applied directly to the bag, says ""PACKED FOR 2010"".Obviously this product had been overlabeled twice, once to say ""PACKED FOR 2011"" and then ""PACKED FOR 2012"" (the topmost label).Seriously, Amazon, if you are going to falsify the labeling, do a halfway decent job of it. This is actually insulting.Buyers, beware, it is not worth it to spend money on something packed for 2010 growing season."
2,Not that good in quality,"I used to regularly buy wild oats raisins and they were the best in taste and quality. I tried Spicy World black raisins hoping it wouldn't be that different. But when you eat these, you will get the feeling that the raisins have been dipped and coated in sugar. I have heard that as raisins get stale and lose their freshness, they get the sugary feel and taste and that's what I experienced with these raisins. If you really want good quality raisins, go with something else."
1,Avoid these like the plague,I went through 4 of these batteries. They work for a few weeks then the battery charge light starts flashing. They only power the computer for a few minutes and the computer shuts down without warning.My 3-year old original battery still works fine. No problems.Stick with OEM batteries.
4,"IRVING BERLIN, HOWARD KEEL---AND BETTY HUTTON AT HER BEST!","The 1950 film version of ANNIE GET YOUR GUN has been out of circulation for 27 years. It has finally been released on video and DVD. Now you can enjoy the rip-roaring Irving Berlin score on CD. Howard Keel has a strong, clear baritone, and Betty Hutton is appropriately loud, brassy, and energetic in numbers like ""You Can't Get a Man With a Gun"" and ""Doin' What Comes Naturally"". And who can forget the entire cast singing ""There's No Business Like Show Business""? The extra tracks (including some by Judy Garland, MGM's original choice for ""Annie"") make this CD a treat for lovers of the American film musical. Highly recommended!"
3,choc. fudge,The fudge arrived and was nearly melted into goo! Seller should have taken steps to prevent product from melting.
4,Back from Australia,"I've been traveling through Australia on expedition (mostly in the Simpson Desert) and this book features awesome panoramic photography throughout the continent. Unfortunately, the references to ""God"" once again muddy its pages. You know what to do, though: get out that permanent marker, careful to keep the real beauty unscathed."
3,"Perfect knife, Horrible sheath",The knife itself is incredible. Ive had it for about 5 years now (still looks new) and use it at least once a week on ocean spearfishing dives here in Hawaii. This company needs to work on a more durable sheath design. The sheath broke within one month of having the knife from normal dive usage and nothing unusual. I have been using it with my own home made sheath all this time and am now going to try to make my own custom Kydex sheath for it. This knife would be 5 stars if the sheath would hold up as good as the knife.
4,another under rated band lost in the shuffle,"I've been following Admiral Twin since even before they were Admiral twin... still called The Mellodramtic Wallflowers.A very talented group of local guys from the Tulsa Ok area who took a shot w/ ""Mock Heroic"" ( a great pop LP) and toured opening for hansen before getting over run by the record company shuffles.Thye have great rock sense and put together songs that are both lyrically well done and have the hook that we hear so often on successful acts who rfeally aren't as good as the guys in Admiral Twin.Thye are worth the listen and so is this CD.You can't go wrong by giving any of their CDs a spin"
2,good buy for sharpening practice and special purpose grinds,"These look just like the set of 8 carbon steel chisels that are available from Harbor Freight (US) for $10. I'm sure whoever ""Woodstock International"" are, they and HF and the rest of the tool gang all buy this set from the same factory in China.These are cheap smallish chisels, but for the price they are very worthwhile for practicing sharpening skills, and grinding into low-use special purpose shapes. I occasionally take advantage of the fact that you can get a sharper edge with carbon steel than with HSS and put a real sharp edge on one of these and use it for final finishing.For the same price, Harbor Freight's set of eight high speed steel turning chisels is a much better buy, they are heftier larger tools and quite credible turning tools. Lots of turners start with them and then add a decent bowl gouge, which both of these sets are missing."
1,It's quite horrible!!!,I have never heard such horrible singer like this one!! I wouldn't buy this CD even if it was for free!!
5,Rich resource,"This book is rich in money saving (and spending) advice that makes sense and can be implemented immediately. It is sound and accessible and joyfully bursts with Woodward Bates' wonderfully wry Southern humor. I was hooked from word one and read this book in a weekend. Bargainomics CAN be a way of life! Read it, act on it and take charge of your money."
4,Fascinating novel of Polish perspective on Jewish Holocaust,"The author was a child during the extermination of the Warsaw Ghetto, anddescribes the Polish wartime experience in relation to that of the Jews he saw beingdeported to extermination.Occasionally apologetic, sometimes confrontative about responsibility, I found the bookto be very readable. Flashbacks/forwards are potentially confusing.Certainly a different slant from the typical Holocaust memoir."
5,Good Product for Price,"Bought this for a 1997 Buick LeSabre. Price was way lower than anywhere else I looked. I looked everywhere. Boxed and came looking brand new or in very good condition. Installed it and ran car for about 3,000 miles with no issues so far. Would recommend product."
4,"poignant, funny","This is a delightfully wicked/cynical story of one's way to the top that has nothing to do with merit, and everything to do with the ability to exploit. Although much more subtle, there is Oscar Wilde's sharpness, dark humor and poignancy."
1,disappointed,I want to know if this was an edited version of this book. I read it years ago and I remember it being much more explicit. This book seems to be toned down quite a bit. Is this a rewritten book? Is there an original book available.?
2,bel ami,The book was very slow and ended rather odd. Did not enjoy the book.i hope the movie is better than the book.
4,Love Triangle!,"My goodness, we thought Hollywood had it's users and takers, this takes the cake! It makes the guys in Hollywood look almost sincere!"
4,The Shoe Monster,"""The Shoe Monster"" was written and illustrated by first and second grade students at North Shuswap Elementary School in Celista, British Columbia, and was received the ""Kids are Authors Award.""This story is about a monster that lurks in the basement of Shuswap Elementary, and befriended Mrs. Bruneau (Mrs. ""B"") and has a nasty habit of stealing shoes from the students at night, but if you are lucky and ask Mrs. B nicely, maybe she can get the Shoe Monster to put your shoe back into the Lost & Found.I personally received this book from my elementary school teacher in Kindergarten, and I have loved it ever since. If your son or daughter loves to read, write, and draw, then surely you can add this delightful story into his or her book collection!"
4,"Works well, save money on wet saw.","This item works as advertised and saved me a ton on having to buy a wet saw. In addition to the MD 17"" tile cutter, I avoided a wet saw purchase, saving me $500+. The only draw back is chipping on the top surface of the tile. But most cuts are hidden by trim or cabinets etc so not a big deal. I was able to cut a 3""x3"" square section out of the dead smack middle of a tile for an electrical outlet with ease. Item comes with 3 inserts for different arbors, a good addition."
3,Okay,I used this to finish 'L' cuts on floor tile and shape small curves. Chips the surface of ceramics. It's okay.
1,Anti-Catholic bias,"Despite the trappings of scholarship, the book is unbalanced. It systematically ignores or downplays the evidence of the Catholic Church's opposition to Nazism. Mit Brennender Sorge, Pius XII's courageous encyclical against Nazism in 1937, is dismissed as a fluke. In fact, it was written with the full support of the German bishops and its publication triggered a bitter persecution of German Catholics. There is little here on the destruction of Catholic schools, the show trials of clergy, the destruction of the Catholic press, the persecution of the religious orders. On the other hand, every sign of Catholic sympathy for Hitler is magnified out of proportion.The result is an anti-Catholic cartoon."
4,An Excellent History of Vietnam Riverine Operations,"This is excellent book for anyone interested in the Vietnam War, and riverine operations. The book overviews Operation Market Time, Game Warden, the Mobile Riverine Force, etc, and it outlines why these strategies were developed and as to why they were, or were not successful.The Navy's primary focus after WWII was its blue water fleet, and it neglected its small boat operations, so during the Vietnam War commanders developed new tactics, platforms and training for their riverine forces to disrupt the Vietcong's logistical lines. As the war dragged on the Navy's mission grew from patrolling the South China Sea to conducting raids on the rivers behind enemy lines. And just as in any war the enemy implemented new ways to overcome the American tactics, which led the American to develop new tactics.This is an excellent account of an often overlook part of the Vietnam War."
4,You Must Go,Those who have lived through an exodus directly or indirectly will appreciate this very moving symphony.
5,A Memorable Symphony,"Albert Hurwit's first symphony is a memorable composition that lingers with you long after the music has ended. If you learn about his method of creating this lovely music, you will find it not only memorable but amazing. The performance by the Bulgarian Radio Symphony Orchestra is solid and accomplished. You won't be disappointed by investing in this CD."
3,Mainly for Colt .45 collectors,"The author spends most of the book describing the history of the Colt .45 and the various forms of the model 1911. There is a short, useful section, on .45 ammunition. A short section on .45 revolvers. Other manufacturers of .45 auto pistols rate little or nothing in coverage.The author is obviously a Colt .45 fan and writes this book for others with the same interest."
5,A Must Buy,"Once in awhile, not often, but once in awhile, a reader comes across a compilation that literally vibrates with the intensity of each of these wonderful stories. Everyone is unique, from different parts of the world, but all contain the central core of Jewish identity, which is a true tribute to all Jews in the State of Israel or the Diaspora. Congratulations to the editors. They have done a fine job of including well-known writers as well as introducing us to some exciting new authors. I only wish my copy was hard bound so that it could better stand the constant use."
1,What was he thinking?,"I had a choice. I could either read 'To Die Like an Amazon' or 'Eat What You Want and Die Like a Man' . . . They were both gifts, or so I thought. Turns out the former was a joke. After a heated conversation with a friend on the culture of the amazons, he gave me Wells' book. My friend is gifted; I give in. He's funny. I laughed so hard I couldn't stop, then realized Mr. Wells didn't mean his text to be a satire. To make a long review short, I'd rather die than recommend this to anyone. I far more enjoyed the diet book.Morgan Tansi"
1,Total waste of good paper,"It isn't often that one stumbles across an author's first effort that is a total blunder incapable of capturing the readers attention. Mr. Tyrone Walls has fallen flat on his face with To Die Like An Amazon, hopefully he will keep his day job.I found this story to be boring and unimaginative, the author obviously has no clue about this subject or history! I can see this book fading away fast and hopefully the author will not embarrass himself again like this in the future.Ishlagara aka WarlordChicagoIl."
3,Great idea but.....,"I love the concept of this pop-up Farm, the design is adorable. However, my 3 year old, who is extremely gentle with her things, has accidently ripped many of the parts & pieces. It is not built that well! I keep a glue stick with me every time she plays with it, which is daily. The cut outs of Maisy & her buddies are very cute."
2,More of a Novelty,Purchased as a Christmas gift a few years ago and the product never was a hit. I beleive it's more of a novelty type item.
4,THERE'S NEVER A BAD PERCY FAITH ALBUM,"THERE ARE THREE SONGS ON THIS CD THAT I REALLY LIKE. ""YESTERDAY"", ""MAKE IT EASY ON YOURSELF"" AND ""EVERYONE'S GONE TO THE MOON"". THE INSTRUMENTAL STYLE THAT PERCY FAITH EMPLOYS MAKES THESE SONGS UNIQUELY ATTRACTIVE TO THE EAR. AS I SAID IN ANOTHER REVIEW, HE CAN TAKE AN ORDINARY HIT SONG AND TURN IT INTO A GORGEOUS CONCERTO."
4,Spiritual Learning Tool,"This Journal is the perfect companion learning tool to Joel Osteen's Your Best Life Now. If you've read the book, use the Journal and take your spiritual journey to the next level of achievement.The Journal and book would make a wonderful gift for a friend!"
1,Look within yourself for answers-not at this book,"If you have trouble in life with something, the best advise any could give is to just look within. You don't need to buy ten dollars worth of something to do some self-meditation.This guy, Joel Osteen, he sounds like a nice Christian guy and all, but all that he teaches can be found in a simple hard covered bible.Any problem you have YOU and ONLY YOU can solve, with the help of GOD, as well of course. My advise is to buy a pretty journal, read the bible often and ask God for help.Another thing is that the passages at the beginning were good, but as it went deeper it kinda made me fall asleep."
3,Couldn't tell from the description that it's a CHRISTIAN BOOK,I'm Jewish so I'm selling this or giving it to someone Christian.
2,your better life now,"i bought the book, cause i thought i'd find in it the suday morning messages of Joel Osteen; however it's not that. I am trying to saythe book is not good, but me, i needed the Sunday messages instead."
1,A complete insult.,"Hellworld is the film that killed my long-spanning interest in the franchise for over seven years. It not only manages to rank among some of the worst films I've ever seen in my life, but it also throws away the Hellraiser mythology, and completely insult the fans in the process by making them look like a bunch of moronic horny teenagers."
2,COLLECTION,IM SURPRISED AT THIS ONE..LANCE HENRIKSEN CAN DO BETTER THAT THIS.THIS WAS POORLY DONE. NOT ENOUGH TO DO WITH THE CENTIBITES.
1,When a Movie series has gone far enough,"Yes, these sequel are one of the many in the Hellraiser series which makes you ask yourself why another one and why is there not enough Pinhead? Because the script for these movie originally was for another movie but Dimension decided it would be better to add Pinhead to it and make it as another Hellraiser movie. Hellraiser 1-4 are the only ones I recommend the rest are not that great and this is just my opinion."
3,Mixed feelings...,"This movie had the potential to be a really good movie. I like the concept of the film. One reveiwer stated it made the Hellraiser community look like a bunch of h0rny teenagers... Well,...I agree...because we WERE. It pokes fun at the whole horror/goth society, horror movies and Hellraiser franchise. Once in a while, you need a movie that doesn't take itself so seriously. Very tongue-in-cheek.Unfortunately, the acting is substandard. But even if it had good acting, it would still feel more like an episode of Tales From The Dark Side, or Hammer House Of Horror, than a Hellraiser film. The film quality looks like video and not quality cinematography. Cheap shock, cheap gore and cheap T'n'A. And about 5 minutes too long (Anything else will spoil the ending). It's only saving graces were Lance Henriksen and Katheryn Winnick."
3,Jenny McCarthy 96 Playboy,"All hail the beauty that is Jenny. Sadly, Playboy is the only source to Jenny posing for the camera not-quite-so-clothed. Playboy really is hardly even a step over Maxim. Obvious air brushing, too much make, and untrimmed private parts was in style and believe me... that's Playboys trademark in this era, so be warned."
4,"""Those were the days...""","This is a good collection of modern classics for a rather unusual solo instrument. It is lamentable that the performer has since that time turned to ""light classics"", with CDs such as the more recent ""Los Bandidos."""
3,History,"Since this was purchased for someone else, it is impossible for me to write an honest review and therefore I have marked it as ok."
3,Sometimes superficial,"This biography of Mussolini sometimes seems like a high school report - it covers just the facts and events of Mussolini's life, with little analysis or depth. There's no insight into the man - for example, why he flip-flopped so dramatically from socialism to fascism. Also, I would have liked more depth and context on Italian politics, Ethiopia, etc. Not bad for somebody who wants a quick read, but there are better biographies out there."
4,cute but small,"I just received this costume and its cute but quite small. Someone else reviewed it and said the same thing but didn't list their size. I normally wear a size 6-8 and a small or medium on top. Mostly small. The bottom fit fine as its flaired, but the top was very tight especially around the arms. The hat is also quite small. The collar is almost a foam like material but you probably wouldnt notice too much if you werent close up."
1,WORST,"Only purchase this if you are under 12 years old or 70 lbs. The smallest dress ever. VERY misleading on the package as 'adult'. Also the quality is about as good as a wet paper napkin. Do NOT purchase unless you are small and like see thru cheap stuff. Very disappointed and returned it. Amazon, as always, was wonderful with the refund."
2,Costume is not One Size Adult,I bought this costume for a 5th grade girl to wear for my program at school. She is a normal size 5th grade girl and it did not fit her. The top part of the dress was way too small.
3,Cute,"Cute costume, but collar is felt and very difficult to iron so that it stayed down. Tulle under skirt is very itchy. Costume runs small, I wear size one and it fit well, but I don't see how it would fit anyone who is slightly larger in size. Material irons out fairly well. Very lightweight costume."
4,see it in a boy's eye,"The young female artist has already brought out two amazing singles and her fab album 'Thank you.' Now she has realeased another fantastic single 'see it in a boy's eyes.' This single is extremely catchy and i'm shore it will go a long way in the charts but i think that nearer the end of the song her voice should of been a lot stronger but it staid the same through out. In my opinion, a good song."
4,Well made for the price,I got these on sale for under $10....they were perfect for my rose garden. I use them every day. Look exactly like the expensive ones in the mail order magazines.
2,Poor design,The pruner and shears are well made and the wooden handles give them an expensive appearance. Unfortunately they are poorly designed. The handles open too wide and are difficult to hold. The pruner is the worst. Would not recommend these.
1,poor and stale,We have order these in the past but this last box was hard and stale. Will think twice about purchasing these again.
1,thumbs down on taste,"I love coconut so this product was a big disappointment. It's all coconut but has a chemical like, almost going moldy taste. There is no expiration date on them so I'm not sure if they're going bad or if they always have the bad taste. A big waste of money!"
3,Darn UPS... bet these bars would've been good!,"Unfortunately when these bars arrived, the box was literally HOT and soaked in it's own oils. I took a bite of one & it tasted a bit funky. I didn't know if it was just me, so I had my husband try one the following day - by that time he didn't even need to bring it to his lips... he could see and smell the mold :o(I really wanted to try these - but I think I'll just wait for some cold weather days before attempting to purchase them again.I didn't want to rate the bars until I actually got to taste one - but wanted to make consumers aware of this shipping problem.FIVE STARS to AMAZON.COM for their quick, kind and courteous customer service team!! You guys rock!!"
3,"Tasty, wholesome but high in sugars! Great for dessert!","Tasty and made only of coconut, pineapple, and rice syrup so they're a nice change from the usual ""nuts and berries"" bars. We use only as a special sweet treat b/c the sugar content is high. Love that it's organic and conveniently packaged for when we're on the go or traveling, etc. MADE IN THE USA!!!"
1,Greasy and Disgusting!,"I was so excited to receive these bars as I had tried other flavors before and absolutely loved them! When I received this item, I noticed the outer box which contained the bars looked a bit ""greasy."" I opened the wrapper to a greasy, oily bar, and was immediately hit with the pungent smell of what could only be described as old coconut scented sunblock. Disgusting!! My husband who is adventurous, decided to give the bar a try...he spit it right out, and ran to rinse his mouth out! He said it stung his mouth and tasted acidic and rancid! The bars we recieved had an expiration date of 12/12, which is far from accurate, if I could give negative stars I absolutely would!!!"
5,Love these - just don't order during the summer,"These are awesome but make sure you don't mind the texture of coconut. I live on these when doing field work or needing something filling but healthy. I ordered them in the warm weather and when they arrived, the outdoor heat caused them to 'sweat' horribly so every single package in the box was greasy.The mango and plain coconut are good too."
5,"Oskri Organics Coconut Bar, Pineapple","I love this bar, but it is not really pineapple tasting at all. It is yellow a bit and has a slightly different taste than the plain coconut bar, but a little more moist. Although I was expecting it to taste different, it is still delicious and moist, would purchase again."
3,Nutrition information is wrong,I complained to Amazon but they never changed the information on this page. There is a LOT more fat than what is listed on Amazon's page. These tasted good and were nice and moist but were not good enough for the amount of fat these bars contained.
3,"Taste good, but not like pineapple","These bars are made of coconut with tiny pieces of pineapple. They taste good, but you can't taste the pineapple. They would taste alot better if you could taste the pineapple with the coconut."
1,poorly remastered for cd - original album much much better.,I really like Brothers Four. I have been listening to these in their original LP version for the last year several times per day to put my infant son to sleep. The LP was wearing out so I purchased the CD. I was very disappointed. The speed was slow. On some songs the harmony was made louder than the melody. Who ever did this did not listen to the original album. I can compensate somewhat by boosting the bass while decreasing the treble. But overall I am not happy with this CD version. I highly recommend getting these in their original album form.
4,Replacement for LP,"I had enjoyed the Songbook for years on LP and then decided to buy a stereo that does not have a turntable, so I bought this. The sound transfer is good. The folk songs were a nice bonus. So often when LP albums are transferred to CD, only that album is included, making for a really short CD. A good choice for Brothers Four fans."
5,Excellent book,"As a graduate student attempting to learn density functional theory and its use in computer programmes, I have found this book to be an excellent addition to my library. Well structured and written."
5,Awesome DVD,"This DVD is the most incredible musical concert I've ever seen. The quality is absolutely stunning, both visual and sound. The performance captured on this DVD is breathtaking, every single song is excellent and there is no fluff in this one. You'll play it a thousand times and never get tired of watching it. Celtic Woman is the best musical sensation ever to come about, the ladies are geniune and will speak to your heart in song. The musical director, David Downes is an absolute musical genius."
5,Irish Angels,"Non-stop entertainment. The only thing better would be to have been there. The music, the costumes, the singers, the fiddle player, the castle setting were all just wonderful. I also bought the CD but the DVD far outshines the audio only disc. These Celtic Women look almost as angelic as they sound. Angels with Irish accents!"
5,Excellent Entertainment,This is an outstanding presentation of excellent talents. The setting is great and the quality & presence of the sound recording is unbelievable if it was truly done in the outdoors.
5,"WOW!! Amazing Women, Amazing Voices",These women sound like angels as they sing so effortlessly and they are very beautiful. The DVD is very well produced and the setting of the castle is perfect for the music. The extras on the DVD are great as well about how they made the DVD. I do not think anyone would be disappointed in this DVD.
4,"Talent remains, variety changes","I'm a big fan of live DVD's for just about any music genre so this is no exception. I must admit that while I do like this title, their first production (smartly performed inside) made the bigger impression on me. While the girls still did a great job, the cool evening weather just barely affected them I think. If I can see their breath on video, they must have been cold. The song selection remained varied. Still Irish in nature, not as many tracks as in the original would be 'recognized' by the casual listener. That's okay though, after all a sequal often is intended for the avid fan who already is fancied with the group. Then again I may just be fancied with Lisa ;-) Either way, I was happy with the purchase and having it as an addition to the collection. You will too!"
5,Celtic Women,"This CD is not available until Jan 30th 2007, but I have seen the total show on KPTV and it is one of the very best I have ever seen. It has a mix of everything you could call Celtic with an awesome rendition on the ""Irish Fiddle"" or violin to a mixture of beautiful songs from each of the artists. The CD's are available from each of the artists and I would recommend them also. Don't miss this one when it becomes available."
5,perfect pitch,These women are amazing in that they have the ability to always hit thepitch of the note correctly without sliding up into it as is common.The voices are beautiful and the orchestrations are excellent also.Very pleased with this DVD.
4,Celtic woman-Anew journey,I find this DVD to be soothing & uplifting. The only problem is that there was no title to the selections on the DVD itself & no lyrics printed on the cover.
3,Prefer singing to viewing,"After listening numerous times to the original Celtic Woman album, leaped at the chance to see the 2nd. I enjoyed the music (would give the music 4 stars) but distracted by the video. I finished the DVD glad that I borrowed rather than bought it. I would listen to the music, but never watch again."
3,Not as good as the first,"I enjoyed the first DVD so much, I was really looking forward to this one. I was very disappointed. The women are beautiful and their voices as melodic as ever. The sound balance was not at all good and the producer had them doing some strange coreography that was awkward."
5,Celtic Woman: A New Journey--Live at Slane Castle,"I own Celtic Woman's DVD which was recorded in Ireland at Slane Castle. I enjoy looking at this marvelous group's renditions of some of my favorite Irish songs. My favorite is ""He Raised Me UP"" and ""Danny Boy"" but I really--honestly and truly enjoy the DVD in its entirety! I am looking forward to seeing this group in person as soon as they come near my area. I feel uplifted and truly entertained every time I look at this DVD and listen to their beautiful performances and song renditions. It is with profound pleasure that I rate this group as one of the best female vocal groups in the world! David Downes, their conductor, is magnificent in his leadership of this group. He presents them in a most favorable light and shows off their vocal skills magnificently. What joy I derive every time I see and hear this group sing. I recommend this group to anyone who truly enjoys great singing and beautiful Irish songs."
3,Celtic Women New Journey,A New Journey: Live at Slane CastleThis is great DVD and everyone who has seen it with us is very impressed. There is only one fault that I can find with the DVD. There are no subtitles with the music. This was very depressing for some one who is hard-of-hearing as I am. There are subtitles on the extras but none with the music. When I saw this on Public TV there were subtitles so I presumed they would be present on the DVD. I have tried to enter my comments on the Celtic Women website but there is no place to do so. If the subtitles had been present I would have rated this DVD 5 Stars.
2,Celtic Woman A New Journey,"I was so disappointed with Journey. It had completely lost touch with what made the earlier Celtic Woman so attractive to me. The individual voices of each of the performers were really lost in this production. Between the background singer and the orchestra, it really destroyed the very thing that made them so attractive to me. So very sad."
5,I love Celtic Woman!!,"*First off, Im a girl using my uncle's account*This DVD is sooo great!!! :DIm only a 15 year old girl and I think the Celtic Woman are AWESOME!!!Everything in this show is wonderful, the angelic voices, the setting, talented violinist Máiréad Nesbitt!! (she is like a little pixie who brings spirit to the show)If you're looking for some good music and want to hear something new....Buy this DVD!!2 thumbs up!!"
5,Entertaining and memorable,"One of three DVDs I purchased, along with the original 'Celtic Woman' and 'A Christmas Celebration,' each of which were delightful to watch and listen."
5,"Celtic Woman, A New Journey","As if it were possible, this DVD is even better than the original. The music isfabulous, the songs beautiful and the singers incredible. We have watched the DVD sevreal times already."
4,Good ambassadors.,"The sequel to Celtic Woman - This DVD and the prior one are those that listen to about 4 times a week. I'm not an art or music critic. I favor the first one over this one, but I like to listen to them both.The artists' blend of traditional and other works are done par excellance. I would recommend acquiring the DVDs as a package."
5,Great performance!!!,"Simply spectacular music and performance by Celtic women. Beautiful, in their colorful clothes!"
5,Great Performance,"I have never seem them before, saw this on tv and I thought they were great. The music was superb. The lady violinist was incredible. I had to order the DVD right away."
1,I still don`t receive the DVD form Amazon,I still don`t receive the DVD form Amazon !can u find out what the problem is ?
1,An offense to real Celtic music and Celtic women everywhere.,"I just had the misfortune of watching/listening to this version of ""Celtic Women"" on PBS. What do these vapid, lip-syncing, saccharin elevator-Muzak Stepford Wives have to do with Celtic anything? It's like the Brady Bunch morphed with Laurence Welk on St. Patrick's Day in Disney World. Very scary and artificial; having absolutely nothing to do with the spirit of good Celtic music that I love. Run away as fast as you can and find some real Celtic music elsewhere if you have a micron of good taste. You'll not find it here. Yikes!"
5,Celtic woman the best cd that I have ever bought.,"This cd is the best and I plan on buying all the other other's. Would like to see them in person, here in the midwest USA Dana"
5,A Delightful concert featuring Mairead Nesbitt,This is a fantastic concert featuring some of the most beautiful voices Ireland has to offer and also the incredibly talented fiddler - Mairead Nesbitt. She will amaze and delight you as she twirls and leaps around the stage with her violin. There is no one else quite like Mairead Nesbitt!
5,Great DVD,Have seen these women in concert a number of times and the DVD is almost the same as being there.
5,dvd,"dvd was in excellent shape and at last i can finally enjoy the one song i absolutely love "" At the ceili! dvd was delivered on time as well, great service."
4,"Celtic Women-A new Journey:Live at Slane Castle, Ireland",I bought it for my mother and she really likes it. She enjoys listening to the relaxing music
5,Sehr gelungene Fortsetzung,"Das Konzert ""A New Journey"" ist eine sehr gelungene Fortsetzung des ersten Konzert`s. Die Lieder sind alle klasse und passen perfekt zu Celtic Woman.Die neue Stimme Hayley Westenra, die auch schon solo große Erfolge feiern konnte, passt hervorragend in das bisher bestehende Quintett. Jede einzelne Stimme ist für sich etwas ganz besonderes.Bitte Celtic Woman, tourt doch einmal durch Deutschland"
5,Incredible,"This is one of the best music DVD's I've ever seen. Incredible tallent, and the unbelievable backdrop of Slane Castle. You will not be dissapointed."
5,Would give it 10 stars if I could!,"This is the most fantastic DVD concert I've ever seen! The only thing better is seeing them in person.Excellent production and great team effort by the ""Women""."
5,Celtic Woman A New Journey Live at Slane Castle,An excellant product. Much better than I expected. Delivered on time as promised. Thanks a lot.
4,More Angels on Earth!,"This DVD is absolutely wonderful!!! It is truly worth buying! The voices are like ""Angels on Earth""! These women have such harmony and such class. I would reccommend this DVD for anyone who enjoys Celtic music.It is a ""MUST HAVE"" DVD!"
3,Copy of the first show.,"The DVD/CD is good with only a few new songs, and too many american classics. Skip the live show just watch the DVD. We went to Baltimore to see them and they copied the DVD every inch of the way. The girls never spoke a single word to the audience. Not One."
5,great!,Awesome. Worth every penny. I've watched it 7 times in 2 weeks. I love their version of Somewhere Over the Rainbow.
3,Celtic Woman: Live @ Slane Castle,"Unfortunately I have to leave a neutral rating. My CD would not play on any of my 4 CD players (auto & home). I returned it for a replacement, and it wouldn't work either.I requested a refund."
3,Celtic women,"Visually quite impressive, but didn't actually have me involved with any emotion with the music. I felt the Celtic Women lacked strength in their personalities."
2,Victims of their own success,"I must say that I was very disappointed with this DVD; perhaps the young ladies had reached such heights with their original DVD and show Celtic Woman, they could only fall to the earth. I have viewed the original DVD so many times the DVD actually skips.After absolutely enjoying the concert when they visited the D.C. area and wearing out the original DVD, I assumed this was the reason they had chosen to includ Hayley Westenera. I am an admirer of her work as well her piece de resistance being Pure; so I received this DVD with great anticipation.What a disappointment; so disappointed that I have viewed this DVD only once. The performances were hollow, contrived and uninspired in stark contrast to the original DVD. The muzzle that was placed upon Hayley Westenra was puzzling. I'm very happy that I bought this product at a reduced price on Amazon; had I paid full price I would have been pi..ed.I will rent their next production before purchasing."
2,"Too Sensual, Too Immodest","If you like to see an hour of up close videography of women's lips, teeth and toungues, then this video is for you. If you are not bothered by your husband watching pretty women sing with their chests hanging out, then you will enjoy this. I did not enjoy it, and found it offensive. I did not appreciate their dresses with breasts hanging out, or low cut dresses. The violinist does not wear a slip so at times, if she is in the right light you can see-through her dress. Very immodest and offensive. They have such sweet voices, but all that sweetness is turned to trash by the what they wore. I did not appreciate my husband receiving this as a gift. Why put a stumbling block in front of a man?"
4,wonderfull show,"It's a wonderfull show,The most amazing show I have ever seen.To see and see again..."
5,Rich in Christology and Trinitarian Thought,"These works of Augustine are invaluable if one desires to understand western patristic Christology and Augustine's trinitarian beliefs. The reader will be richly rewarded intellectually, theologically and spiritually from the writings of the Bishop of Hippo."
2,seams broke apart.,"Not very good sheets. They are comfortable but they are stitched together poorly and have ripped apart. Granted some of this is due to the fact that we have a very large pillowtop mattress and it's hard to find sheet deep enough for it, however that doesn't change the fact that the seam threading is poor."
2,Disappointed,"They aren't labeled irregular, but the color is not even over all the sheets. They are soft, but disappointed in how they look."
1,"The label says King, but it's really Queen!","I ordered King size, the label says King, but the sheets are Queen size! Plus, there are light blue (ink?) spots splattered on them! I wouldn't have ordered them if I had known, because they're not worth the price. This is misrepresentation & false advertising. Not happy with these."
2,Beware...wrong size!,"They are supposed to be king size, but when I tried to place them on my bed, I realized that they were queen size instead. The hassle of returning is not worth it to me. The quality seems okay, I love sateen sheets, but the size mistake is the reason for my low rating."
4,Nice Sheets for the money...,These sheets are very nice.. A little stiff but I haven't washed them yet.. Maybe they will soften after they get washed otherwise love the color and feel..
3,Not bad for the price,"Soft, the fitted sheet is definately a sateen, the top sheet is a little less ""satiny""...not bad overall...a few snags in the top sheet after the first washing (with no use), but overall very soft, good sheets"
4,Loved These Sheets,I was really impressed with the softness of these sheets. They wash well too and just keep getting softer and softer.
1,seconds quality,The sheets are different colors. One sheet is sateen and the other is not.Also the pillowcases are not standard.I would not recommend them for anyone.
3,Not a bad deal for the price,"Considering the price the quality was quite good. I found however that these white sheets had a strong ""pink"" tint to them. Since all my other bedding is white it is quite noticeable. For a spare sheet of sheets however they are fine."
2,some defects in the sheets,These sheets were nice but I bought 2 sets and they each had different defect. One the color was irregular on one sheet: like it had been bleached in areas. The other had some frayed areas that were sewn incorrectly. They were not sold as seconds and I wouldn't have bought them if I knew they were defective.
1,Wrong size,Ordered King size but received Queen size. The hassle of returning isn't worth it since I am disabled and live in a rural area.
1,wrong item in package,i ordered this item in a king size and they sent me a king size package with a queen size bed sheet inside!!!
5,excent product,"It was first time I ordered personal health product from amazon, it turned out to being very good, the the pad just like ads said, they are very good, comfortable. I will order more if I use out. it is cheaper and good ."
1,These are not the Thin Maxi,"Although the title says they're Always Thin, the package is of regular-thickness ""slender"" pads. This listing is incorrectly titled and the product you will receive is not the product named. I now have 108 regular-thickness maxi pads which are not what I wanted, as I normally order the thin pads."
3,"Great buldup, light finish...","I have been reading the Shannara books for as long as I've been reading Fantasy, ever since The Wishstones of Shannara I believe. I've always loved the writing and the world in which Terry places his characters. This series in particular intrigued me because of the new characters and we got to learn a bit more about the ""Old Earth"".Unfortunately, the ending left me wanting for more. The voyage home seemed rushed and thin. I guess I can feel better now that he is continuing the stories in his new book but I didn't know that when I originally finished Morgawr."
2,"Good, but Brooks cranks out the same pulp fiction.","Of the three books in the series, this is the most satisfying. It is well written, and shows the maturity of the author. The problem is that the story is too predictable, and you can see the ending coming like a parade down main street. By the time you have finished 400 pages and the end of a three volume series, you ask yourself, ""Was that it?"" In other words, this trilogy lacks the freshness and originality of the Sword of Shannara series. I'm a fan and will continue to buy Terry Brooks books, but I am waiting for another book that just makes me say ""Wow!"" This ain't it."
3,Not a satisfying end of a trilogy,"Going by the subtitle, the reader would think that the book's focus would be on the Morgawr, a powerful, elder being seeped in magic. Instead, the book continues to pace itself between all the characters giving the reader a feeling of jumping from movie serial to movie serial.Given that the book is the last book of the trilogy, the ending should wrap up all the loose ends. Although the characters come together and some get their comeuppance, there are just as many questions raised as answered. What will the Rovers do now? What will the Ilse Witch do now? What will the elves do?This is not an altogether bad thing. For those of us who find ourselves always waiting for the next Terry Brooks book, we have solace in knowing that there must be new Shannara books on the horizon to answer these questions."
1,same old same old,"I have been a Brooks fan since I was 16 and fell in love with the Sword of Shannara - Unfortunately his latest trilogy fizzles out about half way through Antrax. The overall story line is good albeit somewhat predictable - unfortunately all of the characters are the same - constantly filled with self doubt, constantly going over the same old ground page after page after page... This series should have been edited down into one book - then it would have really been a nice story! As it stands it is a mediocre story mired in a bunch of fluff. Brooks has never been a ""trilogy"" writer. By and large all of the Shannara and Landover books can stand on their own. - He and DelRey are definitely milking it for the extra cash...."
5,Great final...,"Well this is another great book of the Shannara series. It's the best from the ""Voyage of Jerle Shannara"". It's one of the best Shanara books, infact. It has a lot of action, tremendous battle and really good character development.With one word - perfect. Brooks is a Master of Fantasy."
3,"Unmoving, and rather disappointing","This is the third book in the series, and I was really hoping for more out of it.I don't want to mortally offened the diehard Shannara fans, but the the best way I can describe this book, I suppose, is .... bland. It was just there. No gripping moments, no memorable charaters or scenes, nothing to pull you in.This is coming, I should note, from a devoted Shannara fan. I've read all the Shannara book, most more than once. So I was ready to love this book the second I heard about it. Not that I had high expectations, just hopes, I guess.But, it was very disappointing. There was no depth, no surprises. It was extremely predictable, and almost dull.I'm not recommending against this book if you've read the first 2, but if this was to be your introduction into Shannara I think you should start with another. I would start at the beginning with the Sword and work from there.So, all in all, this was just not up to the standards of the rest of the Shannara books."
5,I'd Read It Again,"I thought this book really was the perfect finish, it had great twists in it, and unexpected events. Terry did himself proud in my opinion!!! After reading The Isle Witch and Antrax I couldn't wait to get started on the third. When I did, I couldn't stop and was disapointed I came to the end so quickly-I couldn't put it down! I found this trilogy refreshing-'The VOYAGE of Shannara!' Loved it, couldn't think of anyhing to criticise it on, except maybe how it pulled you into the book at the saddest parts and nearly had me covering my eyes at the scary bits. Hope this helps!x x x x"
4,Fighting For Survival,"To me, the pinnacle of this series was the portion dealing with the computer, Antrax, but I also wondered very much how the situation with the Morgawr was going to be resolved and how Grianne, formerly the Ilse Witch, would confront and accept her evil deeds. Bek displays a true tenderness as he helps her in her time of vulnerability.I was also secretly hoping that at least one elven ranger would make it. But alas, out of principle, they had to be killed off to the very last. And oh yes, I quite understand that Mwellrets have GIMLET eyes. I was reminded of this on numerous occasions. But these were but small points of contention as I observed the corrupt politics of the Federation and wondered how the good guys could possibly survive the Morgawr's fleet. The heroes have failed in their mission in some ways and succeeded in others. Now they have been reduced to raw survival and the reader waits to see how the battered remnants of the crew will ever reach home alive."
5,Great book,"This book was probably my favorite out of the three Jerle Shannara books. It had more action & content then the other two, but I also loved the other books. If you haven't already read the oringal Shannara books I recommend that you do 'cause they're as good as this one."
3,"It's been a while, but I didn't think it was anything much..","I read this book a while ago, but I thought I'd drop in my two cents. As I recall, it was somewhat weak, a fact made all the more annoying by the fact that I read the first and second books and enjoyed them, and then I had to wait for this one to come out... Gah, I don't want to write anymore..."
2,Sadness fills my heart to post this review,"I hoped, I prayed and look what I am at now: typing this review...The first was acceptable, the second needed help.But this one takes the cake as probably one of Terry's worst books to date!Probably my expectations were too high, given Terry's obvious talents, but to publish such a work? Scandalous!!Honestly, this book fall flat. It was supposed to be the climax of the series but was actually the dullest of the lot. Well, I really hope the next series will be better.Alas, I must still finish this review....I give it the...rating of :( aka 2 stars."
1,A pitiful conclusion to a substandard series,"I'm rather astonished that this is the same Terry Brooks that wrote the original three Shannara novels. I don't usually say this, but this series really did come across as a cash grab. Each book is roughly 200 pages shorter than earlier novels, and with fewer lines per page.But these are technical details.The story itself started out well enough in the first book. The usual search for treasure in a distant land, leading to conflict and adventure. A small handful of interesting characters are introduced.Now, book three. By the end, all those interesting characters will either be dead or altered beyond recognition. Through great leaps in logic at various crucial moments, those remaining characters we knew would survive, survive.Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of Terry's earlier books, particularly Elfstones which was one of the best works of fantasy ever written. At best, I found this book to be insulting.I would give it 0/5 if I could."
2,As pointless as the other 2,"I agree with the reviewer who wrote ""much prose about nothing"". Very disappointing. Have read every Terry Brooks book up until now but this will be the last. Wasted money on these 3. Where is the real Brooks? The one who wrote the earlier Shannara? It's almost as if these books were written for young teenagers or children. So many words but very little going on. If you want a good fantasy series get into the George R. R. Martin one."
2,A Great Library Rental Book,"Don't run out to buy this if you can borrow it from someone first. It quickly became apparent to me that this was a ""chase"" story, where all the characters run all over the place trying to get somewhere, and when they finally do, the book is over. Or, in this case, almost over. The characters have inhuman abilities to run and run and run for days, complete with serious injuries/illnesses. The normal human would have collapsed with some of the situations, but Brook's characters carry on, sometimes shrugging it all off with ""oh, it's only some broken ribs!"" It was this kind of fault that made this book a ""one-time-read"" for me. Just read it to find out how it all ends, and then return the book!"
3,Nothing special,"I have mixed feelings about this book. It seems like a great deal of space was taken up saying not a lot. There were good aspects to the book but it failed to live up to the first two. I found that the most interesting characters who made the earlier books so engrosing were all killed off leaving behind the tedious, uninspiring ones. I am completely bored with the Ohmsford hero who seems to be exactly the same in every book Brooks writes. I had high hopes for Grianne but she spent most of the book comatose, only returning for some sappiness with her brother and the fairly pedictable conclusion. It is an enjoyable enough book but slightly disappointing and I found myself missing Walker the whole way through."
1,Boring killers,"Kinky killers is so boring. The script is poorly written and all the characters protrayed in this film is flat. The main reason for me to buy this DVD is because of Michael Pare. however, I am so disappointed that he is not the male lead in the film (or may be there isn't any lead actor/actress in the film, now you can imagine how bad this film is).Michael's talent is totally wasted.Yes, there are many killing shot and sex scene. But all are badly done.It doesn't not reach the ""unrated"" standard. The most is ""NC17"".Michael had one full nude shot when he had sex in doggie style, you could hear him moaned but the scene was shot in wide shot and it only lasted for few seconds.It's not worth buying it, if you are Michael's fan, just rent it. Butdon't expect too much."
3,"It looks good, but.....","I want to love this hand held shower wand, but the spray pattern is very very narrow. Probably only 2""-3"", even when the water is 3 feet out of the shower head. The quality is excellent and the piece is definitely of solid construction."
4,"Works Great, plenty of water","We installed this as part of a bathroom remodel. We didn't use the wall bracket but bought the height adjusting rail to mount instead. Works fine, puts out plenty of water. Suitable for the main/sole shower head if you want."
2,Does not provide what it promises to,"The author presents a general introduction into ga's , then moves over to investment strategies and presents solutions.Unfortunately, he does NOT give background information on the really interesting things like string patterns used, crossover and fitness function and the like. Futhermore, more than one third of the book is filled with endless tables whose content the reader understands after the first table. I guess it makes for a larger book.conclusion: very disappointing."
5,Fantastic book with interesting content!,"The presentation of this book is just as fantastic as the content and vivid imagery. It takes you through almost 400 years worth of exhibitions and its amazing the quality of this collection. My favorites are the ""Pig-Faced Lady"" (1815), ""George Anderson the Living Skeleton"" (1862), and ""Bertolotto's Industrious Fleas"" (1876) - among others. A very interesting read and nice coffee table book."
2,pass dis one boss,"Picked this up a while back because for me all bob is all gold. Truthfully, there are many better options out there. Starting with the Tuff Gong ""Songs of Freedom"" box set. If you have that then you don't need this. GUIDANCE"
1,DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS SELLER,I ordered a cd a month and half ago and still haven't received it. I contacted the seller and never received a response. Had to file a claim to get my money back.
3,Does what it needs to do,"This AC cover is fine for what I needed. It is a little larger than my AC unit, but a little rope around the cover keeps it in place in the winter winds. Nothing fancy, no zippers or velcro, just a cylendrical plastic cover. It's a better alternative to the cut and duct taped plastic garbage bag I used in prior years. We'll see if it lasts more than one winter."
4,Winterizing,"I am pleased with the Frost King AC cover that I purchased online.My AC compressor is 24x24 square. I could not find that size so Iwent with the 34"" round and it fits nicely."
3,Great extras and packaging; poor picture and sound quality,"""Father Knows Best"" is a television classic and still has a lasting appeal. The shows themselves are still fun to watch, but the prints are edited and they vary in sound and picture quality. The extras are great; we get to hear from Elinor Donahue and Lauren Chapin about their experiences on the show (hopefully we can hear from Billy Gray, who played ""Bud,"" on the next season set). Making money is always the bottom line with DVD releases, and sometimes quality suffers as a result; the studio that put these out didn't want to spend any extra money on restoring the shows. Hopefully season two won't have the same issue."
4,I AM VERY PLEASED WITH FATHER KNOWS BEST SEASON ONE,"I had given up hope that ""Father Knows Best"" would ever be released. But i was pleasantly surprised to spot it while searching for new tv dvd releases. I jumped on it and ordered it the same day.It's a heart warming tv show and i am very happy with the quality. I had read some of the reviews that are rather critical of this set prior to buying it and i'm really glad i did'nt let these critical reviews sway me not to purchase this set. It's thoroughly enjoyable and is like owning a piece of television history.Although these episodes may be cut by a minute or two, it certainly was'nt noticeable.The episodes story line flowed well and the picture quality was better than i expected. I personally am thrilled to have season one of ""Father Knows Best"" It's absolutely worth the money!*I hope the following seasons are made available very quickly,so we all can enjoy more seasons of ""Father Knows Best"""
5,Father Knows Best - Season One,At last the greatest TV show of the 50's. I watched it and it is just wonderful. Can't wait for Season 2. I don't know about anybody else but mine are in Black & White.
5,The Best is Father Knows Best,"This is the most enjoyable delightful family show aside of Leave It To Beaver. I was not born when it was aired and never saw this in syndication over the past 40 years so I took a chance and bought this season and loved it and consequently purchased all other seasons. The picture and sound quality are perfect. My only regrets are this show didn't go on for a few more seasons and that seasons 5 & 6 have some repeat episodes such as ""Betty's Graduation, Father The Naturalist, First Dillusionment etc. "" I highly recommend this show for anyone looking for a quality family program that may have been over-looked due to time ( over 50 yrs old tv )"
4,Father Knows Best Long Overdue!!!!,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my Father Knows Best Season One DVD and hope that ""Shout"" is putting out a Season Two SOON!!!"
5,Father Knows Best Season One,The item was exactly as discribed and arrived in good condition. I would gladly buy from this seller again...anytime!
1,Not a Buyer,"This show was a wonderful classic production that I have been eagerly anticipating for more than a year. I was all prepared to purchase it the day of release when I saw the reviews saying that the company distributing the shows on DVD had chosen not to give us the full, unedited shows as orginally broadcast. Reviewers used the term ""butchered"" and that was enough for me to decide that I would NOT purchase this DVD set after all. So, Shout Factory listen up - the consumers want quality, full broadcast versions - not what you edit to fit on a minium amount of space! I urge all fans of ""Father Knows Best"" to wait for the best!"
1,Father Knows Best Season One,"I would have liked to know that this DVD was not made from the original tapes, but from the TVLand or Nick at Night chopped up airings of the show. Sometimes the scene is cut in mid-sentence (apparently where they had placed a commercial.) It's a great show and I love it, but this DVD set is very poor quality"
5,Dont listen to the negative reviews,"I read all the reviews before I purchased this dvd. and the negative reviews had me worried. I immediately checked it out when I received it and found it to be just fine. Yes it is in the original black and white. To colorize it would ruin the quality of a classic. This was made in the early fifties, and the quality considering is exceptional and it has held up well. I did see one instance where it kind of ended abruptly, but it did not hurt the scene or ruin your viewing. There was a complaint that it was not the original minutes. Who remembers that kind of thing and anyway I grew up on the shorten reruns. You cannot tell the difference. The extras if you are a fan are wonderful! If you like Father Knows Best, go ahead and buy it, you won't be disappointed."
3,the only game in town,"Despite the fact that almost half of the episodes are 22 minute cut prints, this set remains the only way of getting the series. At least one bootlegged copy of the complete series is available but has numerous problems that render it worthless. It is up to Shout. I recommend that everyone implores Shout to release the complete series ASAP and restores as many uncut episodes as possible. Maybe after that... Window on Main St. the complete series."
2,"Father May Know Best, but Shout Factory Should Know Better","Unfortunately, ""Father Knows Best--the First Season"" is a compilation of episodes from the serie's first season, and edited like you've often seen them in syndication. A significant source of the pleasure in owning such classic series is that you expect to see them unedited, as they were originally broadcast. The editing of these episodes is obvious to even a casual observer, with dialogue and scenes simply fading out. To add insult to injury, even the closing credits are edited. As the credits are displayed, instead of the show's theme playing through the end, the credits just stop--abruptly. ""Father Knows Best"" deserves better treatment, and so do the customers."
3,Father know best,The show are good just remain us they should but they are not any more now. so different from before how we growup back then?
1,No go,I was all set to buy this but heard from a friend that the episodes were cut down. No have to pass on this unfortunately.
1,Father knows best,"I bought this dvd because it was one of my favorite shows back in the 50's & 60's. Then before I even got it I looked at it again and found out it was in color. This show was never meant to be in color so why do the company's that put out these dvd's coloreise them????? just runions the whole dvd. This was made in Black & White and should be left in Black & White. I can't answer for everyone, but I want these old shows in Black & White like they were meant to be. Good luck on unloading these dvd's. I sent mine back when it arived without even opening it up. So sad these company's would do this to such a fine show. When they bring it out in Black & White I will pruchase it."
2,NOT IN COLOR,"Potential buyers should be aware that these Father Knows Best programs are NOT in color. They have NOT been colorized. I realize that many viewers want everything to be untouched and in the origional black and white. I, however, am dissapointed that this DVD is not in color as Amazon describes above. I also purchased the first season of Bewitched and the colorizing process is extreemly well done on that one."
5,great life lesson!,This is a wonderful story about 'paying forward'. Follow the events that brighten each person's day as a 'feel good' domino effect plays out. Cote's multicultural illustrations have someone every child can relate to.
4,Atrocious Saint,"I prefer historical videos so I am biased. This video is a good addition to your knowledge if you plan to visit the Hermitage. It gave historical depth to what you will see and the man. It explain his immense popularity at the time and explains, even as a slave owner, he was pioneer in the evolution of personal liberty. It would take others to move liberty to the next steps, of course."
1,Revisionist History,"I'm a High School U.S. History/U.S. Government teacher and this DVD is not worth purchasing. The director of this character assasination obviously had a political agenda(Note the poorly educated, and morally corrupt, liberal wing-nut actor chosen for the narration). The production(?)is not even historically astute about the overall era, issues, and politicians. I seldom regret spending money on U.S. History, but the level of sophistication of this work(?) is comprable to a doc on the Tudors,accusing Henry VIII of being a sexist."
3,Andrew Jackson,"Jackson was so popular that Jacksonian Democracy is still spoken of. He was an Indian fighter and a hero. He defeated the British in the Battle of New Orleans, putting to rest any ideas Britain had of regaining power in America. Jackson's Nashville home is called The Hermitage. It has been a museum since 1889. I worked in the Andrew Jackson Building in Nashville while working for the State of Tennessee. Those three equestrian statues of Jackson are in Nashville, New Orleans and Washington, D.C. I put him #4 despite a modern tendency to misjudge him by the Trail of Tears story."
4,Way to wake up,"I will admit that I turned this on PBS at 3 a.m., when I couldn't sleep, because I felt a nice documentary would lull me back to sleep. Was I ever wrong. The documentary was so engrossing that it kept me awake and when it was over, I hopped on Amazon to order my own copy because I wanted to see it again.The most fascinating thing about the story of Andrew Jackson is how little we have progressed in all this time. The controversies are (mostly) the same, the scandals are (mostly) the same. Jackson used the media of his day the way politicians of today do. It was an absolutely riveting look at a period of history about which I was woefully ignorant."
3,Only get this if you are a diehard Sagan fan!,"This is a recording of many speakers at a conference and is NOT as is implied ""by Carl Sagan."" Sagan speaks for only a short time and is ""almost"" reading from his book ""Pale Blue Dot."" Save your money and get that instead!"
3,Could Have Been Better,This would make a good book in addition to another one or a class. It offers a variety of examples but does not explain in full detail some of the elements you need to know in order to solve some of the problems it contains. I does have answers to the odd problems in back however.
5,Spirit Games Book,"Tell you kids one morning, "" It is Crazy Day today"" Celebrate by doing a lot of thingd differently than usual. Say good night in the morning, serve ice cream for breakfast, wear socks of different color, walk backward to the store... You will see how creative your children are! And how much fun your family will have!I got this game from the Spirit Game book and I loved it. 300 others are available for us in this book. The directions for each game are clear, the variations are great, and the examples help you to awake your creativity.Tina"
2,You get what you pay for.,"I was disappointed in the item. Was not what I expected. I read the previous reviews and felt good about ordering the sharpening device. But once I have it and used it some, well....I got what I paid for. That's what I get for being cheap."
5,Amazing!,"Got this for DH to use in his newest hobby. According to him, this is one of the best around. Don't know what else to say on it. Just know he's happy and loves this little thingy."
4,Good product,"Good product, works as designed. Couldn't find it locally when I ordered it, quick delivery. Look locally first though; the price is good but shipping brings the total cost up to what most stores that carry it sell it for."
5,"The Journey ""You Don't Have To Be A Star"" God Loves You","I loved reading the book No Secondhand Rose: My Name is Forshia. I was so inspired and captivated beginning to end. The authors struggles and depression and then her commitment and dedication to Jesus Christ was absolutely wonderful. The scriptures add such a meaningful touch after each chapter. Also her heartfelt prayer at the end for others to know this new life, because she knows it's the only way. This book is absolutely a winner!"
1,Gets your hopes up,"The author promotes the book as if evening primrose is a god given cure/prevention/relief to a series of disturbing problems...however its misleading...i cant say if it has any relief to heart disease or arthritis but with acne it doesnt help at all. I had mild acne and took it for over two years and all that happened was my acne got more proggressive. If youve ever read about acne you would know its more than likely hormonal, and evening primrose has no effect whatso ever on your hormonal balance... my advice dont waste yur money on the book or epoil just go to your practioner... also what it doesnt mention is that if your on medication for acne you probably shouldnt be takeing epoil or some vitamins and minerals. If you have any problems it would be safer to talk to your practioner...thats what they are there for."
3,Nice Material but a bit small,This is a well conceived toiletry bag. The zip side containing nail and other implements is a great idea. What you can't see by looking at the bag online is the overall size. It is much smaller than what I would have liked. Probably a good size to pack in a carry on bag for an overnight plane trip--if they would let you take any of the implements on board. Leather is nice. Would I have bought it in a store if I could have seen it in person. No.
3,something missing,"Bareback doesn't quite start from where Process finished. It's a different, more clean end product. Out go the textured pages and wonderful dirty typography, and in come experiments with light and bare text. There's a lot more to read, and a lot more to discover in this collection of artwork, but it lacks some of the roughness and originality that made Process what it was. There's something missing, some drive missing behind parts of Bareback. Having said that, it's still a worthy purchase if you liked Process and (or) Skyscraper, but don't expect it to have the same affect you got from it's predecessors."
3,One cold night,What a great book. The love between a mother and her child is such a strong bond. Lisa was such a strong character although she was in such danger she made you chuckle. This is the first time I read any of Latvia lives books but I guarantee I will read another. *****
1,Not Enough Dialog,"This was one of the worst books I've ever read. There was not one character who was not irritating. Dave was a whiny wimp, Lisa was a pain in the neck, Susan was an idiot, Lupe and Bruno ridiculous. There was basically no dialog in the book. The constant self-examination by each character was over-the-top. If this is this author's idea of good writing I don't see her with a long career. You need a lot more dialog and less self analysis. Like a prior reviewer, I forced myself to read through this book. A total disappointment. And the constant e-mails to Lisa from Susan were weird."
4,ENJOYABLE FOUR STARS,"I found this book to be very easy to read.I feel that you will enjoy this book, it is a quick read."
3,Good book.,Good book to read. Keep me interested in reading the book. Could of us a little moresuspense. I enjoyed reading it.
3,Meh.,"Good premise starting off but the flowery prose is juvenile. Took too long to develop the story, some of the characters were underdeveloped and the conclusion was somewhat rushed.Pretty much worth the 99 cents."
4,Slightly Disappointed,"Susan mothered a child very young, Lisa, now fourteen has been led to believe all these years that Susan and her are sisters. I felt that enough of the story hadn't developed prior to this disparaging secret released to the reader. I would have enjoyed a bit more character development prior to Susan's big secret, not to mention how ""Out of the Blue"" it happened. Sure, Lisa was arguing about finding her parents, It just seemed this big secret, the main storyline behind the book, was thrown out there so quickly and easily.With all that said, I was only slightly disappointed. Other than the one issue, One Cold Night Is a great book, with many twists and turns to keep it interesting. Towards the end I could hardly put it down. Katia Lief is a very talented writer and am looking forward to reading her other works."
3,Was alright,I have learned one thing....everyones taste in a really good book is as individual as a person is. The book was o.k. I was able to skip through pages and still get the whole jist of the story. Seems to be too much info that could have been left out and not effected the story at all.
3,good Book,"good book, Interesting read from a good author. Fast flowing and found interesting , would recommended it to all readers"
