1,waiste of $14.99,"man what a mother lovin waiste of money, jeezy the next mike jones aka black vanilla ice, whole cd just jeezy goin yeah, thats right, gyah, thug motivation gyah, how about lets not get it you fool"
1,"young jeezy,,, no thanks",young jeezy a new raper from the south who is in the group boyz n da hood is quite sucky.... he sucks in dem boyz and gucci manes song so icey....... and this cd is just terrible
2,this is OLD!!!!,"THIS CD IS OLD YALL!!!!!!I CANT BELIEVE YALL THOUGHT THIS WAS HIS NEW **** YALL CRAZY ITS JUST LIKE GAME DID BEFORE HIS REAL CD CAME OUT GIVE JEEZY A BREAK HE IS ONE OF THE REALEST RAPPERS OUT. YALL WILL SEE WHEN HIS CD DROP, THE REAL ONE JULY 26 HOLLABACK"
4,Jeezys first,Its a pretty good album for it being Young Jeezy's first. It had a few tracks I aint like but for the most part it was bummin.
3,Not bad,It certainly looks nice and I love the elegance of the couple and the powder white. I just can't get past the fact the carriage looks like a gravy boat.
1,Buyer beware!,Possible bait and switch. Unit sent was damaged and was a much cheaper brand! After a dispute filed with Amazon I got my money back. Look for a better source if you want to buy an insrument.
3,a little low,"This chair is a little low to the ground. I've had it for a couple years and it still looks great, so it will last a while, but it is sort of creaky when you sit on it and that has not stopped since the first day i got it."
2,"What, no leather?!","Two stars are for the design which I really like. But for the price, and to garner more stars, I expect leather. Yes, it's possible; Ikea does it.If this same vinyl product were priced $69.95 I'd consider buying one just for fun."
4,Good quality,"The speakers are good quality and don't feel cheap like similar, generally lower priced models. My only complaint is that I expected it amplify a bit more. Still, a good value."
3,MP3 speakers,"I purchased this item so I could listen to my MP3 player while I drive, because I have an 1 1/2 hour commute to work. The speakers are easy to use, but I was a little disappointed with the sound. I know that the volume is controlled with my MP3 player, but it wasn't loud enough for me to hear it well while in traffic. It would be nice if the speakers had volume control."
4,just what we needed,"This product is just what we needed. Very portable, no batteries needed and good enough sound."
1,Does not fuction as a speaker,"Very disappointing product. It does not function as a speaker. I plugged it into my phone and another MP3 player and it made the sound smaller than what it would be without the speaker. If it doesn't function as a speaker, what am I supposed to do with a block of metal? Use it as a paperweight? I returned it, requesting a refund. Also, it's a lot heavier than what it looks like in the picture."
4,Very good speakers but ......,"As I said, very good speaker, good sound for the price, and the portability is a plus. But there is an issue about this, I have an Ipod touch and the output inpendance is 32 Ohm and this speaker is 8 Ohn, which means this will drain too much current from the Ipod and may damage it. I would like to know if someone uses this Sony speakers with the ipod touch and how is doing."
3,disappointed,sound is not better than my notebook's sound and cable is kind short. Kind of disappointed and returned it.
2,Not as good as I hoped....,"After looking at the generally positive reviews, I thought that these speakers would be good for me as I'm not demanding on rich bass and hi fidelity. All I wanted was a booster speaker to use at work with my smartphone. I'm a low voltage installer and sometimes have to stand in front of panels and terminate large amounts of wire for hours. All I wanted was a portable speaker that would boost my phone's music player to a more listenable level without chewing through batteries day after day. These are well made with good construction, solid weight, and I love the way the cord stores. They are also the perfect size to slide in with my tools to be convenient. The only problem is that they aren't even as loud as the speaker on my Blackberry! Way too quiet! The sound quality is a little thin, but its fine. I just wish they were louder. After all, aren't you supposed to be able to HEAR speakers?? For me, they were a waste of money and will never be used."
4,Sony Travel Speaker for MP3 Players,I was pretty happy with the sound for such a small and portable speaker. It ran well from my MP3 player and that's what I wanted.
3,Okay for small spaces or on-the-go music,"The sound quality isn't great, but if you need something that you don't have to plug in and that you can take with you anywhere, these are nice to have. May be good for camping, picnics, etc."
4,Decent Passive Speaker,"I got this to use with my i-Pod because the other speakers I just bought did not fill the bill. This feels nice and heavy, the one wire is only about a foot long (maybe less). There is no volume control and the volume is only a slight bit louder than the speakers in my ancient laptop. The sound quality is adequate for listening to audiobooks or podcasts. Since this is what I use it for, I am happy."
1,What? Dentists and guys stealing Canada?,"Out of all the thrillers which combine the secrets of denistry and forensics, this is the least appealling. I wish that the book had focused more the lives of hard-working, but fearful, professionals, anxious about their careers and futures. Something about cults would have been good too."
5,AMAZINGLY well written.,"If you like biographies and are a sophisticated reader, this book is spot on. Every sentance was a work of art. As a woman writer - the story of Pearl Buck was particularly fascinating and inspiring."
2,Pearl Buck was magnificent; Peter Conn's book is NOT.,"This book, although entitled, ""Pearl S. Buck: A Cultural Biography,"" only skims over her life in the barest manner. There is very little of her life in this tiresome book. She was a remarkable woman with much talent; the author takes great license in criticizing her work. I wanted to learn about her - not what the author thinks of her writing. If I hadn't been such a fan of hers, I would have tossed this book after the first hundred pages."
1,Boring!,"I was so disappointed in this book. It was horrible, not believable and very, very short. Don't get duped or waste your time on this one."
1,Is this book really written by a human?,"Scenario is on it's own very interesting, but lacks or omits really deep knowledge of German armed forces organization during WWII. Example: German batallions were not usually commanded by a lt.col but by a major.Some chapters are seemingly made with ""copy/paste"" and ""replace with""-method. Only names or numbers are different. Is this the book is created with some kind of software or robot?I was expecting much more for this book than I got."
2,Not so much a story as speculation,"If you are looking for a story such as Fatherland or in the Presence of My Enemies, this is not the book to buy. This is a speculative work based on historical documents. Interesting but not a traditional alternate history."
1,$5 for this? Don't Bother,I paid $5 for this short book. It took me less than 30 minutes to read and it was not very good. Do not waste your money on this piece of trash.
1,no talking,"I searched long & hard for a dictionary that would pronounce french. This product, for which i was willing to pay handsomely, does not speak french. While it does written translations both ways, the only audibles are in english, and I could hardly understand the english pronounciations. The dictionary capabilities are good, but there is no reason to pay more to HEAR the words if they are only in english & you can't understand them anyway. I'm returning this item, and buying a non-talking electronic dictionary."
2,Highly Disappointed,"The information was good, but I was very disappointed to see the pictures only in black and white. Most of the information was about the color of one's aura, yet there were no color on the pages where it should have been. The whole book looks copied from the original and only in black ink. Now I have to rebuy the book from the original publishers, The Theosopical Society and I was very disappointed to also see that the Society has it in color and cheaper."
1,Don't waste your money.,"Although I didn't try the 20 x 30 size, Elmer's 9 x 12 ""Self Adhesive"" Foam Boards DID NOT STICK AT ALL (at least no longer than 5 seconds) on ANY of the four different types of photo paper I have at the house! I ended up having to use spray adhesive since the project had to be shipped immediately, so I was VERY disappointed in the Elmer's product.Instead, you might want to try the following self adhesive boards that I had great results with ...Just Stick-It! Mounting Boards: 11"" 17"" Four Piece Set, BUT!!! ...be extremely careful and accurate on your very FIRST attempt. I found out that the hard way and destroyed a photo in the process (since the adhesive on this product is ""not very forgiving."") Worth it though, because you can be sure that whatever you are mounting will ""stay stuck!""Good luck! Hope this helps!"
2,Sorry I bought it.,"I purchased these adhesive foam-boards for the purpose of mounting large format photos.Here's what I didn't like:~You're supposed to be able to 'easily reposition' photos' - I assume until you really press them into place. I found that just touching part of my photograph to the sticky surface resulted in an impossible-to-remove bond. Any repositioning was ridiculously out of the question.~For large format photos, even careful placement - followed by pressing into place - resulted in many air bubbles, which were impossible to remove.~The boards warped within a few days of mounting large format photos."
3,Does not include the foam,"I ordered this because I can't get these locally. I chose this one because it said ""Includes the Filter Cartidge 2LK0540000 and the Foam 1LK0545000"" The foam was not included."
4,took forever to receivie it.....,"just what i needed as my old one was just that...old...and I had trouble finding a replacement at my local stores...ordered it online and although it took a couple of weeks before i got it, I am so glad I have it...my vacuumm is much happier now...packaging was appropriate, pricing was fair"
5,It's A Vacuum Cleaner Filter,"What can I say? It looks just like the original filter. It does have a different color sponge in it, but I got another (same) vacuum cleaner, and the filter has yet another color sponge in it. I guess that makes no difference.I didn't like the way it was shipped to me. It was shipped in a plain manila envelope. By the time I got it, it was nearly ripped out of the package. The post office actually had to tape the hole. That may not be relevant anymore. They may use a different shipper, or they may do a better job, because I did complain.Bottom line, it's a filter. It is same as original."
5,Dirt Devil F13 Filter,The filter fit and worked as expected. Found the best price on Amazon.com.Dirt Devil F13 Filter
3,No Need For a New One,"While I was looking for my model number I saw a sticker that said ""Washable Filter"" on my Dirt Devil vacuum. I checked the manual and it said to run the filter under water and rinse out the foam sponge, let dry for 24 hours. So everyone double check your filter and manual."
3,ESL Writing,"This book was suggested for my language and literacy class. This book is more theory and research than a book that has quick tips and bullet points for you to refer to. If you want a methods and techniques book that points out quick ideas, you may want to look at another book. This book mainly deals with the hows and whys of ESL writing. Very good theory book."
3,Toning the Sweep Review,"The novel Toning the Sweep by Angela Johnson is a story about Emily a fourteen-year-old girl (the main character) and her mama are moving to Little Rock after Emily's grandfather's funeral. Where Ola lives Emily's Grandmother . Emily finds out that her Grandmother is dying from cancer. Throughout the whole book Emily is videotaping Ola and her friends for memories. Later Emily finds out what really happened to her grandfather and why her mama is so mad. Ola, Emily and mama are moving to Cleveland so mama and Emily can take care of Ola. Toning the sweep the name of the book comes from a chapter in this book when mama and Emily tone the sweep of Emily's Grandfather. To tone a sweep means to hit a plow so it makes a loud noise to make sure everyone knows that someone is dead. This book shows that what ever goes wrong families should always stick together. This book was good book that was quick and easy."
3,Toning the Sweep,"Toning the Sweep is a great book by Angela Johnson. The main characters of this book are a girl named Emily, her mother whose name is Diane, and her grandmother, whose name is Ola. Ola and Emily are very close. Throughtout the novel, you can tell that Emily's mother is jealous of the relationship that Emily and Ola share. Towards the beginning of the book Emily and her mother find out that Ola has cancer. There are alot of happy moments in the book such as when Emily viedotapes her grandmother under the Joshua tree. In the book you can see how much Emily cares for her grandmother. The book is based on relationships between mothers and daughters."
1,THE BOOK THAT PUTS YOU TO SLEEP,"I will always remember this book as one that put me to sleep quickly. All they ever do is sit around in ""the dry"". The mother goes through amazing mood swings too. One minute she is tired, the next angry, and the next sad. And what grandmother and mother in their right mind let a 14 year old girl drive a car around the desert?! The book has no ending either and is extremely anti-climactic. I hated this book and everyone that i know also despised it. I strongly recommend that no one who wants to read something half way engaging read this book!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,TONING THE SWEEP FELL FLAT ON ITS FACE!!!!!,"If you have bought this book...consider yourself deceived. Toning the Sweep has voice, but no action, or plot. 14 year old Emmie and her mother Diane come to the desert to visit Ola. They discover that Ola has some sort of cancer. Emmie wants to tape Ola's life and friends on a camera. That's the weak and so dramatic(just kidding, actually it has no dramatic parts)plot."
3,My review of Toning the Sweep,"The story Toning The Sweep by Anglela Johnson is a powerful but sad story about a fourteen-year-old girl, named Emily, and her mother going to the desert to help her dying grandmother, Ola, pack up her home and move back to Cleveland with Emily. Ola was diagnosed with cancer. I thought that all the characters in the story very interesting, especially Ola. She was very lively and was a good blance when the mood is sad. I would definitely give this book three out of 3 stars."
3,Toning the Sweep Review,I felt that the book was O.K. I only felt that it was O.K. because I like books with a lot of action and also like books that you do not have to read sections over again to make sure that you know what happens. But I still liked the book a little because I felt that the characters were done very well mainly meaning the relationships and how that they were all brought together in the end.
1,"Dumb book , Dont waste you time","I thought that Toning the Sweep was a good book if you are able to deal with boring chapters were nothing intresting or important happens. It is just about this girl named emily and her mother, they go to california to visit ola and then they find out she is dying of cancer. Then emily decides to video tape her life. Then they decide that ola should go back to ohio and live with emily and her mom so they can take care of her becasue she is old and has cancer. Ola has an old convertable buick that was her husbands who was lynched in alabama were she used to live but when her husband was killed she drove to california and stayed there. In the end i thought the book was boreing and i would not suggest it to anyone."
1,A boring book,If you like staying home and retaping your glasses and watching old Star Trek episodes then you will like this book.The book Toning the Sweep was not a book I like. It was short and not exciting to me. There was not anything but my teacher to keep me reading it. Nothing happened to pull me in and be into it. I did not like the way it was written at all. It was short and I did not to know what was happening half the time because it would jump all over the place. So I did not like it.
2,sweeping the tone,"Ty Parrish Bill Keeney Toning The Sweep Engilsh 10a Nov. 14,2000 Toning The Sweep, written by Angela Johnson, is a book about a girl's life who has to move from place to place and has had some loss in her time. Emily (main character) is a young girl at the age of 14 and has a pretty boring life. Ola (grandmother) makes the family move because of deaths in the family and hurt feelings. I think Toning The Sweep was kind of boring but had some good points about young people's lives. Emily has to deal with this death, and in doing so, she learns about the desert. I liked the fact that she is in the desert but I felt this book was missing something. I thought it should have some bigger climax scene. The climax scene was boring and I didn't care what happened to this character. Even though she has a dramatic life, it is still very boring and unsatisfying."
2,Toning the sleep,"The book Toning the Sweep wasn't a very good book.It was ok at first because I though it would get better but it didn't. Maybe I didn't like the book because I'm in the 11th grade and this book is a 6th grade book. The book would have been better if it would have talked more about the civil rights and how Ola's husband died. I don't want to make it seem like this was the worst book ever because there where a few good parts,like when Emily took Ola's car the first time. Also, when Emily and her mother had that ceremony for Emily's granddaddy. Another good part of the book was when Ola was dancing and then Emily learned how to fandango."
3,A@b.com's Review,"In the novel Toning The Sweep, Emily, who is the main character, is telling her story about how she and her mother, Mama, are going out to California. They are going out there to pick up Emily's grandmother, Ola, who has cancer. Ola is slowly dying. She moved out to California after her husband was killed. Ola has many friends in California but she had to leave them because she is going back to Cleveland, where Mama and Emily are going to take care of her. The book get the name toning the sweep came from a local custom that occurs when someone dies. They hit a plow so that it makes a loud tone to let everyone know that someone had died. Emily learns this as she get to know her grandmother more and more. The book shows how three generations can come together and share what has happened and what they think will happen. Although I did not like the book that much, I thought that it was good in telling everything that can be learned by talking to different generations."
2,Toning The Sweep,"Toning the sweep was a very good book about life.I didn'think i would learn anything from this book. The book tought me that ever one has inner secrets,that don't want ever one to know but they just are scared of there secerts. Her grandmother had a secrect but ever one knew about it i think she wanted ever one to know so that she colud have everone's help. She had help and she knew were it was it was in her family i think it was nice of here daughter to let her live with her. I think the diana justneed to catch up with her mother, and she wanted her daughter to learn more about her mother and to have her mother and daughter to spend time together.so she colud learn more about her faily histoy, i think that is why she was video tape was for i don't think it was more than a tape for her grandmother buti i help her get to know her grand mother."
3,Toning the sweep,Toning the SweepThe book is about a fourteen-year old girl named Emmie dealing with the fact her grandmother is dying of cancer. Emmie becomes very confused by the change in her family and was too young to understand what was going on.The book is very hard to understand becaues it jumps from place to place and character to character. The chapters don't seem to flow into one another and it made it hard for me to follow. I would not recommend this book to anyone to read. There is no action in it and it didn't keep my attention.I think that someone in the 5th or 6th grade might like this book or if you like to read journal writing you may like this book.
2,Toning the Sweep,"Toning the Sweep, by Angela Johnson, in my opinion, was not an exciting book. Itdid not catch my attention. There was no climax in the plot. The only dramaticthing is Ola's pain, which is not too interesting because people go through pain allthe time. David and Martha's character's purposes were not apparent to me.There were many parts I did not understand. I would not recommend this book toanyone I know. I would not have chosen to read this book for pleasure. In the end,when Mama (Diane) and Emily, her daughter, tone the sweep together to sendEmily's grandpapa's spirit to heaven. It seems too late but at least they can finallybe pacified with it. The plot in this book was rather vague."
2,"The not so good story of a girl, her mother and grandmother",~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I thought that Toning the Sweep was a good quick read if you are able to deal with boring chapters where nothing really ground breaking or important happens. If I had had a choice I would not have read this book at all. I think if I had to rate it on a scale of 1 to 5 I would give it a 2 since it wasn't that that good of a book in my opinion. I kept waiting for the book to get good but it never did =(!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3,The thoughts of slappy,"Toning the Sweep by Angela Johnson is a good read if you want a book that is short but has a lot of meaning behind it. It teaches you to be strong when things are looking bad, to keep on going when it looks like you cannot go any further. But best of all it teaches you to make the best out of your life because you only have one life."
5,"Dream: A Tale of Wonder, Wisdom and Wishes",This is an excellent book. I read it to my father at his 90th b-day. He loved it! It is a great book to review life's journeys and experiences.
5,Amazing book!,"This book was a gift to my son and I just recently ""discovered"" in our mass library of books. It's such a gem... a beautiful story about dreams and the changes of life growing up. The illustrations are gorgeous. I love reading this to my kids! (ages 2 & 3)."
3,Inappropriate Age Range,"This book was too immature for my 14 yr. old niece. However, I will send it to my 11 yr. old granddaughter. It has beautiful pages."
2,disappointed,I purchased several of these books as high school graduation gifts based on recommendations. I felt the illustrations and text was far too childlike to give to a high school graduate and therefore ending up returning them all.
5,Dare to Dream,"Dream by Susan V. Bosak is a daring picture book featuring the work of 15 famous illustrators, including Leo and Diane Dillon, Shaun Tan, and Robert Ingpen. All of the illustrations are beautiful and amazing unto themselves, but it is Ms. Bosak's words that tie them all together into one brilliant tapestry.Each page takes you through a different stage in life, from exploring infant to introspective young adult, to confident adult and beyond. All are about dreams - little dreams, big dreams, and everything in between.This is the kind of picture book you collect and then buy additional copies of, so you can give it away to all your friends and family. It's really just a beautiful book and you'll want to share it with all the dreamers in your life, whether young or old.It reminds all of us of the importance of our dreams, our wishes, our hopes and desires.--Kimberly Pauley, Young Adult Books Central"
4,"Dream: A Tale of Wonder, Wisdom & Wishes",This book made excellent graduation gifts for several high school graduates this year. It helped me convey my greatest wish for each of the recipients--to keep dreaming. I also use the book in my classroom and use many of the activities at the related website to help my students learn more about dreaming and then taking the steps to make those dreams come true. http://www.legacyproject.org/The book contains one of my favorite poems-Dreams by Langston Hughes. The whimsical illustrations highlight the wonderful message this book conveys. I would highly recommend this book.
5,Top of the latin house heap,"To the uninitiated, Sancocho is one of the best Latin House bands. This music is hot, loud, fun, and full of mischief. This CD has the indispensible ""Tumba la casa,"" which is one of the great contemporary latin thumpers. This is great dance music, perfect driving music. For young latin bands they are only outranked by the masters, DLG."
3,A twist on some old favorites.,"I think that this album is pretty okay. I myself am a devoted Christian who of course loves God, and thus I don't exactly agree with all of his principles in his music, but I have to admit that Sweet Dreams and I put a spell on you are some of my favorites. Although I am not a manson maniac, I sure do like those two songs in particular."
2,All Human make mistakes,Sorry but whit this album Marilyn Manson show os that he is Human...Not SATAN Or GOD....so we can love him.
1,Waste of Time,"I'm not even going to waste alot of time writing a review on this poor excuse for an album. I love manson but this ""album"" is mostly noises that run for about 3 min and there are only about 3 songs on it. Some not even his own. It sucks. Save money for ANY of the other albums or remixes."
3,"Good, but not great.","I am a big Marilyn Manson fan, and I own a lot of his albums including this one. Out of all the Marilyn Manson CD's, this one is probably the least best. Don't get me wrong, it does have some pretty good songs (Sweet Dreams, Kiddie Grinder, Everlasting C******, and Rock 'n' Roll N*****) but most of it is just a bunch of ridiculous skits and wierd eerie sound fx. It's strictly for fans that appreciate wierd musical art with an eerie touch to it. Others should steer clear if they want some real music. Most of the songs on this album are remixes from songs on Portrait of an American Family. Portrait of an American Family is a much better album by the way."
2,Not Manson's Best Work!,"This album really is quite poor for the multi-talented singer. With the exception of Sweet Dreams (are made of this), Dance of the Dope Hats and Rock & Roll ... there is nothing I can recomend. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big Manson fan, it's just that you're better off keeping your money for albums like Antichrist Superstar, Mechanical Animals and Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death).All of which are truely worth of being called Marilyn's best work."
4,Manson's MIXED UP,"I agree that if you want to first-listen to Manson, you shouldn't start with this one, this is a record for fans and people looking on weird stuff. I love the gags, and my fav song is I Put A Spell On You, i thought that song was written by Screamin' Jay Hawkings. Anyway, it includes the song that made them popular worldwide: the cover to ""Sweet Dreams"", and ""Rock n'Roll Nigger"", which is an anthem for misfits in a beautiful society instead of a racist song. Manson plays around with cool horror landscapes, such as babies lamenting and backwards masking. This is a fun CD to get, but to start on Manson, buy Portrait, that was my first album and i was lucky enough that was the way.Cya"
3,Manson's Brilliant Marketing Scheme,"Marilyn Manson hoped this EP would gain them more attention in the media, as well as a legion of angst-ridden teenagers, and they got exactly what they wanted. The music, videos, and odd noises stirred up controversy every where, and of course this only increased sales. The inclusion of ""Sweet Dreams"" was another good idea since the cover hit brought serious rock radio and MTV airplay to the band for the first time. Other than this, there's not much here besides weird skits such as ""The Hands Of Small Children,"" ""F-ck Frankie,"" ""Sympathy For The Parents,"" and ""May Cause Discoloration Of The Urine Or Feces."" This EP began Manson's rise to fame, but much better albums like ANTICHRIST SUPERSTAR and MECHANICAL ANIMALS showcase the real musical talent this band has."
2,OVERPRICED!,"What? This is just a bunch of talking! Sure, the songs are good, but this CD as a whole is only worth half the price. Whatever you do, save your money for another one of Marilyn Manson's CDs, and just avoid this one!"
3,Uhhh...,"I bought this album at the local Fred Meyer, and was shocked that I was getting a Marilyn Manson album for under twelve dollars brand new. Well, I took it home, put it in the stereo, and was really stunned, and almost felt really short-changed. This album, or maybe I could say it is an EP, is sixteen tracks, and not even half of them are real music. I don't know about you, but then again, when it comes to buying a CD by one of my favorite artists, and I blow good money on it, I really expect my money's worth. However, this album did get a higher review than expected, only for the reason of the covers and remixes are out of this world. And besides, hearing some redneck country guy doing an accoustic version of ""Cake and Sodomy"" is absolutely priceless."
3,fans only...,"im not a Manson fan...but i like his music very very much...and this Ep...i couldnt say that it worth buyng...cause it has 16 tracks...and only 6-7 are indeed tracks....the rest of the cd is full of instrumentals and hidden tracks...i almost got scared when ive heard the last hidden track..i thought that is something wrong with my stereo or something....anyway..the best tracks on this cd are sweet dreams,rock'n'roll nigger and some remixes from cake and sodomy and dope hat...i recomend this cd to die fans only..."
4,THIS IS NOT AN ALBUM.,"it is a great EP tho. it was originally a dope hat single, which shows. that would have been okay too, as dope hat was the first song that turned me on to marilyn manson.anyway, there is some filler, and i'm not that fond of the cover songs that much anymore except for rock n roll nigger. you should definently buy Portrait Of An American Family before you get this one."
3,Not A Must Buy,"This album is just another album to have in your collection, but it's really just remixes among other things. My personal favorite song on the album being ""Rock and Roll N*gger"". You gotta admit; the first track is creepy. Overall, it's just an album to have, but it's not a must have."
3,I agree with John. Not Manson's best.,"A year on from Portrait of an American Family, Marilyn Manson released the stopgap EP Smells Like Children. Where the full-length debut showed sparks of character and invention beneath industrial-metal sludge, Smells Like Children is a smartly crafted horrorshow, filled with vulgarity, ugliness, goth freaks and sideshow scares.Manson wisely chose to heighten his cartoonish personality with the EP. Most of the record is devoted to spoken words and samples, all designed to push to the outrage buttons of middle America. Between those sonic collages arrives one new song, retitled remixes of Portrait songs, and three covers, all given a trademark spooky makeover. Musically, it may not amount to much, but as a sonic sculpture, as an objet d'art, it's effective and wickedly fascinating.See U in the Future..."
3,A Little Bit Better!!!,"This is my 5th Marilyn Manson CD, and on the last two I bought, he didn't have that spark I was looking for. Right now, my favorite songs on this is Sweet Dreams (Are Made of These)and I Put a Spell on You. If you are goth, and like Marilyn Manson, you'll love SMELLS LIKE CHILDREN!!!"
3,"OK, Manson's worst no doubt about that!","If you are going to buy this CD, take warning right now: This cd is all remixes, with 3 cover songs. Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This) is the only cover that's ok to listen to, and most of the remix tunes you immediatley forget as soon as they're over. Buy Potrait Of An American Family instead, if you like the 30 second demos, since most of the remixes (except for Scabs, Guns, and Peanut Butter, made by Twiggy Rameriz a.k.a Jeordie White) are from that CD, however I can't be too harsh on Manson, since he owns the crappy bubble-gum pop records that people call ""music""!"
5,THREE TON GATE,This album lives and dies by Daisy Berkowitz's guitar playing but forget the past his new band THREE TON GATE is alive and well!! check it out !!
3,a decent album,smells like children is not Marilyn Manson's best CD but in my opinion is still worth purchasing. Some of his best music mixed with some crap but what CD doesn't have a few bad songs.
3,OK,This cd is just ok i am a dedicated manson fan and most of the songs like discolouratin and eternal c*** sucker are mostly skits i enjoyed white trash and sweet dreams alson the diary of a dope fiend and rock and roll nigga i like the cd but only a few of these songs will be frequently listened to by me
2,"Marilyn Manson's worst album, but it has it's good ones","Don't get me wrong, Marilyn is a very good artist, but what happened with this cd? I have all of Marilyn's cds but once I got this one and popped it in, it made me think, where is the good Marilyn music I bought this for? This cd does have a few good songs on it, but nothing that is not on another one of his cds. I'd recommend downloading what you want off this or previewing it before purchasing it."
4,Good Remix EP from Manson and the Spooky Kids,"Every single Album from Marilyn Manson has been extremely good in my opinion, and i add this one to the list. This Remix EP is a mixed bag, with half of the EP being filler, and the rest killer. Its about 8-8 of each. This EP has a very creepy feel to it, and definitely sounds like something that is best listened to while doped up. I would compare this remix cd to that of Trent Reznor's Fixed. Both are distorted masterpieces and i recommend fans of reznor and manson to pick each of these titles up.** To Jackson Brooksbay: You are ignorant for even thinking this is deathmetal. You obviously have no clue what Industrial/Metal or *Shock-Rock* is and you sure as Hell don't know what Death Metal is. Next time, think before you write a review that the rest of us laugh at."
4,Not His Best,"This one is not as good as other works. In fact may be the worst album by Manson. ""I Put A Spell On You,"" ""The Hands Of Small Children,"" and ""Sweet Dreams"" are the beauties here, but the rest pale in the realm of Manson music. I would recommend ""Portrait Of An America Family"" or any other fine work by this master poet."
2,This isn't Portrait,"POAF is much better than this crap! (I know, not helpful). But cover EPs shouldn't be allowed in sophomore albums. Why? It doesn't show their REAL talent. This is mainly shock value, with one good cover: THe one of ""Sweet Dreams."" But it's real freaky at the end, for anyone who hasn't heard it, but I bet you have.I used to be scared of him because his cover for ""I Put A Spell on You"" hurt my ears so bad. Every song here that's not a remix is a cover. Actually, a couple of tracks are funny. But I like some of the remix, but those choppy sounds are just pure irritating!However, a few tracks hold my rating back from a one and have made me think twice.I ONLY RECOMMEND THIS TO MANSON DIEHARD FANS. I like POAF and LTOE. Also, Holy WOod, his latest. But this will not be for you."
4,This cd is ok.,"This CD is only OK! This is probably among Manson's worst disks. Only about 5 songs are good, including Sweet Dreams."
3,Not for the faint of heart.,"If you are part of the Manson craze spawned by the ""Antichrist"" album, then this album would probably not be well recieved. This second full length album is more for those who are interested in the underground sound. If you liked the portrait album, then I definately recommend that you at least listen to this one."
4,The most creative Rock CD I've ever listened to,"With this ""Smells like Children"", Marilyn Manson has probably made one of the most inventive and new ideas bringer albums since NIN's Pretty Hate Machine, remembering a dark-sided Pink Floyd. All the ""non-musical"" sequences (which are the bigger part of the album) create a dark, heavy, dense, almost impenetrable atmosphere of pain, decay and delusion. Not recommendable for the straight-music fans, this album is a must-have for every lover of the musical experimentalism."
4,It's pretty good,This has more skits than songs I think but the songs and remixes are great and the sweet dreams cover is worth the price of the CD. The skits are hilarious to and if you're a Manson fan you need to get this!
2,ok,"this cd is ok, the majority of it is samples and remixes, what talent. there are a few good songs, (rock & roll nigger, the dope hat remixes, i put a spell on you, and sweet dreams). this disc has the coolest titles, but imagine my dismay when i put on the hands of small children and it's just noises. if you like smaples and noises i recommend it, but if you like Portrait i don't recommend it."
3,not bad,"it's got 3 ok songs on it, and the rest are just remixes of the good songs from POAAF. i guess if i'd paid about 1/2 the price for it i wouldnt' be complaining."
2,odd,"this album is odd. anyways it only has about 3 or 4 solid songs and two are covers...well it has some pretty eerie content but the price is too high. most of the ""songs"" are just conversations that were recorded. buy antichrist superstar because it sounds good."
3,WHERE THE HELL DID THIS COME FROM?,I owned this CD back in the day. I really liked SWEET DREAMS and lets get this correct... nobody would have noticed MARYLIN MANSON if not for this song. I thought the CD was garbage even then but I put it on once in a while for a few laughs. The White trash cake and sodomy was pretty hillarious. I never really knew why I had it.When MANSON came back a couple years later his whole game had changed with ANTICHRIST SUPERSTAR. There was a lot more attention on that one which I virtually paid nothing. I basically always thought he was sort of a retard or something.Three stars for this cuz its somewhat enjoyable for the rare tracks that I have a habit of collecting.The real material is on PORTRAIT OF AN AMERICAN FAMILY which isn't bad;and maybe you should know that there is also a BEST OF package now that may be allright.I can take or leave it. Sometimes I think his lyrics get in the way of the music when it actually starts to rock. Too bad.
3,Its ok but not Mansons most brilliant work,Now this cd is decent not great i like all the covers and sweet dreams did get him noticed but there was so much left out i would have loved to see a get your gunn and lunchbox remix it had potential some of the skits are cool but can get annoying. Don't look at this as a manson album to get look at it as a album to get after you have all this major album and are looking for more MM.
1,manson has better albums than this,"This album has five OK songs:tracks 4,5,6,7 and 15 and these aren't even that great,dont even play the other tracks as they will probably scare the (crud) out of you due to how bizzare they are. Dont get me wrong I am a huge manson fan and I love all his other albums but if you buy this album you are going to regret it."
1,A Brilliant Revelation! Thanks Manson!,"Boy, after listening to this hate addled,talent-free, squalid and cheerfully cruddy disc, I began to put two and two together:This is the reason that S.A.T. scores are declining!"
1,Smells like crap,"I cannot stand this disc.Like most manson discs it's repetitive,boring,atempts to be shocking,and in the end is pointless. It's hard to belive after something as good as Portrait,he released this awful EP.His band all look like transvestite wannabees,and the cover is the stupidist thing I think I have ever seen.I got it for for 5 bucks and I feel ripped off.DO NOT BUY."
1,Wish the rating system went lower!,"What The (...) is this. This album sounds like a soundtrack to a ... man. Every song is S**t! The track f**k frankie is sick, s****Y chicken gang bang is like whta the hell is this?, and Thr rest sucks. People think this is metal but I got news for you ,This is P****y music! If you want real metal check out Pantera, Metallica, Megadeth,Alice in chains and Ozzy Osbourne. That's real metal unlike you gothic, (...) up creeps.MARILYN MANSON S***S A**!!!"
1,Sh*tty and pointless at the same time.,"Wow, this album really f****d up. The best song is sweet dreams are made of these, and it is not that decent. Every song on this album sounds like Marily nmansons mind. Tracks s***y chicken gang bang, F**k frankie, scabs, guns and peanut butter, Hands of small children, Everlasting c**K sucker, and may cause discoloration of urine or feces sound like his mind. Just hold a Microphone up to his head and you will hear one those songs. Then the rest is some crappy covers that are all crap. Don't buy this album. If you think Marilyn manson is real metal, then you are wrong. Go get some good stuff like Metallica ,Black sabbath, megadeth, Ozzy osbourne, van halen etc. All of Mansons albums suck."
4,"great cd, not enough actual songs",i though smells like children is a good cd not quite as good as anticrist superstar. the only bad part is alot is just messing around not actual songs which i like.
5,Great C.D. of goofing off,I liked this c.d. almost as much bas Antichrist Superstar because I thought it was interesting and spooky. This is a classic c.d. of weird stuff
2,Waste of money,"Ok was this a remix album or what? All I heard was remixes of portrait songs and covers of 80's songs, and very disturbing skits. Sweet dreams and everlasting c***sucker are the only ones worth playing. If you want a good manson album then get holy wood or grotesque. But don't waste your money on this."
4,interesting and entertaining!,"even after a long time of being into all sorts of rock/metal it wasn't until I really sat down and listened to this that I broke my preconceptions of Marilyn Manson. I don't agree with what Marilyn Manson has to say, but this world does have a dark nasty streak and hiding and pretending it isn't there doesn't help so I feel Marilyn Manson say what they want to say well. Music is dangerous but banning it can be even more dangerous.Although this album is a bit lacking in content I only paid budget for it, so in that respect it was worth it. More recent albums are better value for money but this album has a rough dark and nasty aspect to it which I didn't feel existed so much in the more recent titles. And `Sweet Dreams' is fantastic."
2,Not that great...,"So, as sort of a newfound fan of Manson, I'm not sure that I have a right to truly give a review of his work...but this CD is not that great. There are two good songs on it, Sweet Dreams and I Put a Spell on You. All the others are weird and really not the style that I fell in love with!!"
5,The break through.,"Still remember my friend and myself buying this on a school field trip to the movies. We had to hide it until we got home to rock out with it because the teachers would take it away due to their poor judgement and terrible taste in horrid music. Anyhow they would not stop this classic from reaching the masses. Amazing album, very well done and contains the break through cover Sweet Dreams. \m/"
4,Very good product,"Long lasting and cleanable, a filter can't be much more efficient than that. I've used this item previously in my Porsche, and I'm pleased to see it offered in domestic cars"
3,"Well, its Ok....","I bought this based mainly on the reviews from previous customers and also because of the amazing low cost it has. Its even cheaper than the original air filter.I was very excited to install it on my car and see any noticeable difference, unfortunately there isnt any big difference. Dont expect this to be like a cold air intake or that you car will make differences sounds.I felt the car had a better kick when accelerating or perhaps is a placebo effect.Either ways, its cost affordable, you can wash it and gives better mpg. My final recommendations is to buy it, but with correct expectations."
2,PITA,"SERVICE GREAT, PRODUCT OVER REPRESENTED. COULD NOT FIND JUSTIFICATION FOR CLAIMS WITH ACTUAL USERS. MORE TROUBLE THAN IT'S WORTH."
3,Dodge Ram Tailgate cables,"As fate would have it, both of my OEM tailgate cables broke at the same time. I thought I'd try these as they had mostly positive reviews. The item DOES NOT match the photo, the metal tit is missing on both post connectors, though this doesn't affect performance.Of greater concern is the QC on the manufacturing of these cables is obviously ""loose"". My identical cables are of different lengths (approx .7cm (~1/4 inch)) this results in one being slightly slacked while the other is taught.May not be an issue, but thought I'd let this be known..."
5,Same as OEM,These worked great for my 98 dodge ram. They look exactly like the ones I replaced. They seem good so far.
4,Son of Erasure,"Too often, comparisons of synth bands to the old masters (Depeche Mode, Erasure, Pet Shop Boys, New Order, etc.) are made unfairly. Most bands thus compared are given the benefit of the doubt. They rarely live up to the comparison. Usually, these bands make pathetic attempts that come no where close to the creative power of their forefathers. Usually...Blue October is an exception to this rule. While there is not an original note to be found, Blue October (BO - unfortunate acronym) are the champions of imitation. They DO Erasure. This is no small feat. These are not Erasure covers. These are Erasure songs never heard before. Vince did not write these but if Andy were singing, you'd never know.The voice is not Andy and that's the give away. Otherwise, this is classic Erasure. Well... son of Erasure."
1,please change your name!,"we all know who the real Blue October is and this music from the Blue(UK), is just more 80's, Erasure type music, that's been done over and over. No originality what's so ever. Nice try!!"
5,Excellent!,"I've studied innumerable books on Security Analysis, but have yet to find one that satisfied my desire to fully integrate financial statement analysis with valuation--until now! Penman's book does an excellent job of presenting all the various valuation methods and critiquing the strengths and weaknesses of each one. He does a superb job of showing the relationship between cash flow and accrual accounting and how each relates to valuation. He also shows how corporate strategy affects both the financials and valuation and how to do decent pro formas. For the studious stock analyst, this book is well worth the extra time required to digest its many insights. I rate this book second only to the original Graham and Dodd's Security Analysis."
2,Not a good teaching tool,"This has been the worst textbook I have had to use! The book is poorly written, and does not convey its message in a clear and concise manner. I have had to re-read several passages, and still can't make sense of them. I have also found that when trying to solve the problems at the end of the chapter, I have not had great success in finding the assistance I need to solve them by going back to the reading. The examples are not very well written, which makes it that much more difficult to solve the problems. This may be a good text book to supplement a live lecture, but it is not a good book for online classes."
2,Not very sturdy. Call me disappointed.,"I purchased this item based on positive reviews, but sadly am pretty disappointed. The individual rings keep popping open, spilling belts all over the closet floor. The rings don't seem to be sturdy enough to handle more than a few lightweight belts per ring. The description says it can hold up to 40 belts?? Unfortunately, not the case for me.I was excited to try this new belt holder, but think I will be going back to the large single ring style (had to dig it out of the Goodwill box). Old style is inconvenient, but it actually holds the belts without coming apart."
3,80% doesn't cut it: 1 of 5 rings were bad,"After a lot of research I ordered one of these, based primarily on positive reviews and it seemed as if it would be better than single-ring designs.I was surprised when I opened the first ring, because it was very tight and I had to pull it apart. Three of the other rings were also tight, but that's fine since I figured they would loosen over time. But one of the rings is so sloppy that it flops around and won't stay latched, and falls off the hanger. I didn't want to take a chance on one of the next five rings being defective so I requested a refund. Wish I could just get a replacement ring, but that isn't possible,now I have to start searching for a replacement. It was nice to get all my belts out of a dresser drawer and didn't take up much space in the closet."
1,Bised and obsolete,"This volume, an update of an earlier work by the late Peter Bebblewaite, is little more than an obsolete exercise in wishful thinking by the Catholic radical left. For the book to be at all relevant, it needs to be updated again, to reflect the changes in the College of Cardinals (fairly significant in the last few years). Even such an update would do little to further recommend it, as there are other, more recent and less biased works on the same subject.Give this one a miss."
5,One of my favs by McNaught,This is one of my favorites by Judith McNaught. I read this book last summer on a hot summer day on a boat. Nobody could pry me away from this great story! Needless to say I had quite a burn.
1,This was my third and last Judith McNaught book....,"Ms. McNaught's books are all the same: overly long with similar twists and turns, just different details. They all take you on an unenjoyable roller coaster ride of infantile emotions from immature characters. The men and women only have to hear some bit of gossip or witness some scene which they've totally misinterpreted, and instead of asking the person they are supposed to love for an explanation, they turn on them with a vengance that is downright scary. The men especially seem to be able to turn their feelings from adoration to animosity with lightning speed, causing them to treat the women very badly, while the women don't seem to do much in return except still love them, which makes them appear rather weak and pathetic. My first McNaught book was Whitney, My Love, and while it was the best of the 3, there was much in it that I found unsatisfying. Perfect was the second, and Almost Heaven will be my last."
3,It's dragging and not as good as i expected,"Well, i've read other McNaught's works, unfortunately I am quite disappointed with this one. I found that the story is rather too long and i didn't feel really attach to the story as i did with the other novels. There's lack of chemistry between the hero and the heroine and i think it's rather annoying to see Ian treated Elizabeth the way he did and how could Elizabeth be so stupid to be so forgiving and trusted her brother so much over her husband. I believe that their problems could be easily and hastily settled if they use their brains and discuss the matter rather than prolong the matter by running away etc. Judith McNaught is not at her best with this one though."
4,"A Good Read, Well Worth It","First of all, I bought this book because I'd heard many good things about it, and it was by one of my favorite author's. The begining was intruiging, but I started to get bored of Elizabeth's recolection of the past. When it finally got going again, I was having to wake myself up. At the end, I actually skipped some pages just to get to the reconciliation. But i loved the Scottish setting, and the characters seemed to come alive. And JM always does a good job, so if you like her, go on and read this book."
3,NOT awestruck,"3 stars was a stretch. I love Judith but not this one. The prequel, Something Wonderful,was wonderful, 5 stars, but Almost Heaven failed by comparison. I thought it was slow, flat and too much back and forth. I would have given it 2 stars but I enjoyed the fact that Alexandra and Jordan from Something Wonderful were back! Judith, how about a steamy make up scene at the end instead of boring words that leave us wondering?"
5,Coulden't Put It Down!,"This is the first book I've read by Judith McNaught, and I simply loved it! I found myself entranced for the next 24 hours; I didn't put it down until I finished it. I highly recommend this book."
5,The Kind That's Worth Multiple Reads!,"Just got done reading some of the 5 stars and all of the 1 stars and felt I had to add another to the 5's! This book has been one of my favorites for years. Have probably read it 3 or 4 times. Since there are so many reviews, I won't go into detail other than to say:There is a moment in most of her books when the man realizes he was a dumb jerk. Ian's light bulb moment was really spectacular and touching. The first time I read it, I cried. Not many books can do that to me."
5,The best of McNaught,"If you have never read a Judith McNaught book (you're missing out) this is the one to read. This is a great book to read when there are no distractions around - you will find you can't put it down!I fell in love with Elizabeth and Ian and their story. From the moment they meet, the chemistry sizzles. I found myself laughing out loud and cheering their triumphs. I found myself saddened by their despair. Judith has such a way with character development that the reader usually feels as if they are old friends. I have read most of Judith's books over and over again but this is the one I have read the most.The story touches me as much now after many reads as it did the first time I read it."
5,I keep re reading this over and over,"I love this book, it's amazing, as are all of Judith McNaught's historical works. Elizabeth and Ian are so lovable yet incouragable at the same time. You want to ring their necks, and hug them at the same time. I read this book time and time again, and this, and something wonderful, are my favorites."
5,My favorite of them all,"I have been re-reading this book this week. It is my favorite Judith McNaught book of all time! I like the setting, the twists, the characters. Even the secondary characters are so well-defined (i.e. Robert, Roddy, Duncan, Lucinda)that really fuels my imagination even more.Moreover, Ian and Elizabeth are my favorite characters. It's refreshing to have the hero admit his love to the heroine at the middle of the story - often it takes until the last few chapters - but in Almost Heaven, I was made to feel that love, which made the trials that they had to endure later more painful, and their reconciliation, more poignant.I definitely recommend it for the romantic at heart. :)"
3,ALMOST A DISAPPOINTMENT!,"I have almost read all of JM novels except ""tender trumiph"" But This was the only book that I almost disappointed in...It was in the begining where the story went on about her past, i got so bored, then when they got down to the point i was happy until Elizabeth runs off with her ""lover"" or whatever...damit she can't even put two and two together..I mean why don't she just asked Ian about the truth since Ian would never lie to her, then she has every right to go...But no she doesn't want to hear both sides of the story so she runs off with her brother making hm feel like a jackass in front of England society!...The only thing that made me changed my mind about the book is how she wrote the ending..."
1,"An annoying, frustrating, infuriating book!!!","I have read glowing reviews of Ms. McNaught's books, and this is the first one I have read. I found it delightful up until exactly page 425, when suddenly the man who was a ""genius"" couldn't put two and two together, (wife's brother is missing could appear at any time, wife runs off with mysterious stranger--get a clue!) and the woman who was so in love threw over every ounce of good sense, facts, and loyalty, to follow a worthless brother in a totally cruel and harebrained scheme. I lost all respect for either one of the characters, but especially her. I can forgive many things in a heroine, but disloyalty and stupidity aren't among them. And the ending is totally contrived--the simple characters and incredible plot are definitely more forgiving of our lovely and faithless heroine than I am. If this is what makes Ms. McNaught's works so glowingly wonderful, I will happily read not another one of them!"
3,Cute Regency,"Cute. Sluggish in parts. I got this after reading her ""Kingdom of Dreams"" a medieval (I'm guessing this authors only medieval?), which I loved."
1,NOT WHAT IT SEEMS TO BE,"This item is listed as series 6, unmasked, wolverine varient. The problem is, is that the item pictured is the unmasked series 3 wolverine. Series 6 is the brown costume wolverine.Marvel Legends Series 6 Wolverine (Variant) Action Figure"
1,Disappointment,"We agree with Wendy - don't waste your money. The method used to attach the footrest to the Ketrike is a belt that goes around the main bar of the trike. After buckling the belt and tightening, it'll work until the child puts any amount of pressure on the footrest. The belt easily loosens and the footrest digs into the wheel/pedals, causing the trike to stop abruptly - which is a pain for both the child riding and the parent pushing."
1,Doesn't work properly,We've had the same problem with the footrest locking up the trike and lurching our child forward. We took the trike to the toystore where we purchased it and the sales associate is going to contact Kettler to see if they can resolve the issue.
2,Good in Theory,"We purchased the Kettler Lil-Toote Kettrest to use with our daughter's Radio Flyer tricycle after reading that it would be compatible....however when we received it,we damaged it just trying to install it. Good idea to make a footrest for little ones, but Radio Flyer needs to make one for their own tricycles."
4,Does the job but a little expensive,"I bought the 4 in 1 Radio flyer tricycle and my son is still too small to touch the peddles so I bought this foot rest. After reading someone else's comment about breaking it during setup, I was gentle when I installed it and it was fine. It took a little coaxing to get the foot rest pushed low enough to sit on the peddles but once it was setup it was great. It has been two months and still works fine."
2,Sounded like a good idea but not needed.,"The footrest sounded like a good idea to keep our 14 month old's feet off the ground, but she quickly figured out how to keep them up and now on the pedals. The footrest does a good job of transforming the trike into a stroller, but we use the trike to learn and have fun, hence the footrest went on once and came off after the first trip, and will not be used in the future. I'd skip the footrest, unless you need it for some reason. A horn, bell, and basket are all great add ons for the Trike though."
1,Any information????????,"We have the kettler Blossom and I ordered the foot rest assuming if would work because from the descriptions it sounds like almost all Kettler have the auto free wheel system thing.I cannot find the answer anywhere which is extremely annoying, not even the manufacturer!I'm starting to be annoyed with Kettler!!!"
5,Great read,This is a great read for anyone who is going on a vacation or just needs a break from their day.
2,"Amusing, at best","I stopped reading it at the halfway point. It was just too, like one reviewer said, contrived. I gave it a two instead of a one, as the author really nailed some of New York City's unique eccentricity. That was good for some laughs. The description of the Southern town was authentic, as well."
4,Another hit by Franks!,I love all of the books the Franks writes!! This along with all the others does a great job of transporting you to the lowcountry!
3,"Really good, but a little too familiar","I thought this book was another fun Dorothea Benton Frank book about the south and island living. Although it was a little too much like Plantation. The same basic story of a woman who moved to New York from the south and found herself becoming swept up in city life and her husband's world. Although this time, Miriam was struggling to find her way back to herself by reconnecting with her sons and becoming a part of their life again.After several trips back to the south, she began to see the new ""Mellie"" arrive and reconnect with her mother and her friends. She begins spending more and more time with her mother and begins to see a drastic change in her heath...ending even more like Plantation."
3,Not her best work,I have enjoyed all of her books but I just could not connect with these characters and the story line seemed a bit predictable and contrived.
4,Land of Mango Sunsets,"This was a great book. It explored the relationships that are found in many families. It also evoked the magic of the particular part of the country that was showcased( the low country). A great read, kept my attention and was indeed a book I was happy that I purchased."
1,"BORING, not up to par for a DBF fan..you will be disappointed.","I'm not sure why so many ""5 stars"" for this book, but will go against the popular vote and tell you honestely that is BORING compared to her other novels. I have read them all and it is apparent that DBF may have run out of interesting characters or storylines to write about.The story is very bland, predictable and silly.Read reviews from national book critics for this one and you will see it's actually not the ""greatest book"" written as some of the readers on Amazon have claimed.I'm sorry Dorothy! I really do love your other books!"
1,Dumb,I thought this was suppose to be a funny book! I couldn't get past page 10! It was just terrible.
2,Maybe I missed something..,"After reading the other reviews I feel like I might have missed something, because I did not care for this game. I played it with 9 friends who also agreed with me. We felt the play of the game was tedious and in many cases some teams just 'free jumped' their way into a big lead. We also felt that at least half of the questions, especially in the movies and tv categories were totally obscure. Anyway, just my opinion maybe you'll feel different."
5,great game,"If you love the 80's you'll love this game, it has alot of 80's trivia questions, we play this game alot with the family."
5,The definition of fun in a box,The 80's game is one of the most enjoyable trivia games I have played to date. What makes it so enjoyable is the fact that not only are you playing a great game but it sparks some fond memories of a decade that shaped a lot of us. One of the best features of this game is that it can be played very casually as well as played by your more serious trivia buff. I recommend this game highly to anyone who enjoys playing games and having fun with friends.
4,Great 80's Fun!,"If you remember the 80's (or not but would like to learn), this is a great game! It's the best source of entertainment for people who grew up in the 80's and try to think of the years in which the events took place. The questions took me back to my teenage years. What a decade!! This is one of my favorite games I have, and my guests enjoy it as well."
2,not as fun as the reviews make it sound...,"I added this item to my wishlist (and received it as a gift) after reading all the positive reviews. But after playing the game with three others, I didn't get a lot out of it. The others who played with me didn't enjoy it, either.Part of the problem is that I grew up in the 80's, but was probably too young to remember some of the things that happened. (I graduated high school in 1997.) But I also felt that the questions were phrased funny and were hard to read and although the game shouldn't be completely simple, some of the questions were really obscure.So, if you were teenage or above in the 1980's, go for it. You'll probably enjoy it. But for today's early to mid-twenties crowd, I would recommend that you pass on this one."
3,Not as good as I had hoped...,"I am definitely a child of the 80's but found this game a bit difficult. We did better when we played it as a team, because the sports questions were way too hard for everyone except the one sports fanatic of the group. It took a very long time to play unless you land on the jump space just right. We ended up changing the rules and it was much more enjoyable, but the questions are quite challenging even if you grew up during the 80's."
2,Not for the average cook or foodie,"I was first introduced to Kylie Kwong through her cooking show on the Discover Home channel. On her show, she's always cooking these warm, savory soup dishes with lots of veggies, fish and seafood. Her cooking seems very simple, but this cookbook is anything but.The recipes it contains are complex and filled with exotic ingredients that i doubt I could even find at my local Whole Foods. There wasn't even a simple seafood soup recipe listed. I flipped through the entire book, and made my final decision after flipping to the one of the last recipes in the book, octopus something-or-other. I'm out.Kylie Kwong seems very nice, and she has a great cooking show, but this book is a complete departure from the food we see her prepare on TV."
3,Not What I Expected,I was hoping for a book more based on Kylie's TV show. The ingredients in this books were too exotic. I want to be able to find most of the ingredients in our local supermarket. I ended up returning the book because I couldn't find one recipe I would even try.
5,Heart and Soul,"Another stunning cookbook from Kylie. This recipe book also has a narrative about the making of the tv show which inspired the book. The recipes are again outstsanding, they include cuisines from other cultures but done with a chinese twist."

3,"If you like Breakfast at Tiffanys, you'll like this album","That just about sums it up -- Breakfast at Tiffanys is the hit off the album, but the rest of the album is satisfying done in the same vein. You remember, don't you? That kind of alterna-jangle light guitar rock that was popular in the early 90s, before grunge took off? Deep Blue Something has a little bit of that 1990 Madchester sound, crossed with a bit of the Posies' first album (a truly spectular listen by the way). They really do sound a bit british -- surprisingly, I believe they're from the South (alabama or something). The record's not groundbreaking or anything like that, but it's a fun summery sound.So if you're the kind of person who's still humming Breakfast at Tiffanys, and is curious about the rest of this album, give it a try. You probably won't be disappointed."
3,Very Van Halen-ish on half of the songs.,"Deep Blue Something had that alternative thing with their big hit Breakfast at Tiffany's. But did they listen to Eddie Van Halen's guitar riffs too much while making this album? Most of the album's second half sounds like something pulled off of any of Van Halen's first few albums. And while that helps, it doesn't show the band's originality a lot. There are some reflective numbers here, but this is a very guitar-heavy album for their debut. It helps to have musical influences, but show your own music instead of sounding like another band. DBS made a good first effort, but originality needs to be expressed more, and I hope they did it on their later albums in the '90s and 2001."
4,Don't judge this cd by breakfast at tiffany's,"I loved this album! breakfast at tiffany's is good song, but doesn't reflect the bands style for the rest of the album. its more alternative rock, then pop. Way more guitar and drums, than you run of the mill pop tunes. But i love it, and have been trying to get another copy, because i wore out my first."
3,Great CD,"When I bought this cd in high school I thought this was the next up and coming band. The cd from beginning to end was a joy to listen to. I am very surprised they did not make any more music. I wonder where they are today. If you liked the song ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" and like this type of music, then I highly recommend that you purchase this cd."
4,Don't judge it by Breakfast at Tiffany's,"I love Breakfast at Tiffany's but this album is so much more it's shame for those who listen to it and judge it by this song. Halo, I Can't Wait, Song to Make Love are great, but the whole album is solid effort. I held off Home to end because it's perhaps one of my favorite songs of all time, mellow but uplifting, the perfect on the road song when away from friends and family. I still play this album at least once a week and I have had it for 4 years."
1,Flash In The Pan Album,"This album was nothing. No wonder no one remembers this group. The only reason I remember them is from the song ""Breakfast At Tiffanys"" the song that VH1 played to death a few years ago."
3,Actually 3 1/2 stars :),"When this album was initially issued (1973), the critics were merciless in their criticism. I'm not sure what they were expecting....""Mr. Tambourine Man"" all over again for 40 minutes? This is very good album that represents where the various members were at that time (musically) in their lives.The Gene Clark songs (along with the Neil Young song Gene sings) are among his best, and these guys may have never sounded better vocally. This album is certainly better than FARTHER ALONG and(the dreadful) BYRDMANIAX, and I'd definitely buy this one before buying even the reissues of those two albums."
3,What might have been...,"The title of this effort should be ""What might have been"". The potential for a great recording was there but unfortunately the hearts of all of the 5 participants were not. Gene Clark stands among the ruins as the hero of this effort. His two originals are beautiful. ""Changing Hearts"" still gets to me after all these years. His singing on the two Neil Young songs are among his finest efforts. Where were Roger McGuinn and Chris Hillman? Too much David Crosby excess and not enough McGuinn/Hillman input. For example, ""Sweet Mary"" is beautiful. However, despite the flaws I wore out the LP and very much welcomed it's release on CD. Ah, what might have been....."
4,One of my favorites...,"I'm puzzled as to some of the less-than-stellar reviews given here. This has been one of my favorites for 24 years, especially ""Full Circle & Sweet Mary"". I think it's very evocative of a certain space in time and I like it."
2,Byrds disappointing 1973 reunion album,"This is a must have album, but only for the Byrds completist. The best song on the album is Neil Young's ""See the Sky about to Rain"" which evokes the powerful voice of the late, great Gene Clark and Chris Hillman's mandolin in counterpoint to an electric guitar lead. Otherwise the album is nearly a complete dud. I rate it well below any of the previous Byrds albums and would recommend any of them in reissue (Sony/Legacy) over this. Also Gene Clark's ""No Other"", or Roger McGuinn's ""Cardiff Rose"", ""Thunderbyrd"", Hillman's ""Clear Sailin"", etc...."
4,The Circle Is A Wheel,"Unless you are a Byrds fan, you probably aren't aware of this album. Which is why I feel that it got somewhat poor reviews. Based on previous Byrds albums, their fans had come to have higher expections in original content. However, what is not taken into consideration on this album is the fact that not alot of planning or preperation went into this project. For me, it was accomplishment enough for some of the original Byrds to check their ego's at the studio door long enough to treat us to their harmony again. Then the ego's pulled the plug on the tour."
2,file under: nothing,"An album of nothingness for no reason.Hillman's song is the only stand out.This isn't a band.This isn't even a singing group.This isn't The Byrds.I don't know who this is. I don't know who this was intended to cater to. I don't know why this was made. By the sound of it,neither do they.Inoffensive Californian Rock.The one thing the REAL Byrdsnever were.FILE UNDER: NOTHING"
1,Hidden agenda?,"Marilyn's review hit it on the head. Moreover, it should be emphasized that Elizabeth Clare Prophet is actually the charismatic leader of a religious cult located in Montana that secrets away weapons among other things. Their belief system is a hodge-podge of theistic speculation. I can only conclude that this book is a 'hook' to get people interested in E. C. Prophet and perhaps even recruited into her cult. Buyer beware!"
5,"very informative, i have the book published in1883","the versiion i own was published in 1883,, I have read this book several times and am now reading it to my grandchildren"
4,Dope Album ( a must for underground hip hop heads ),"This is a dope album, the beats and flows are sick. Support the underground and buy this album, you wont regret it."
4,Masterminds Underground Railroad,"A lot of music these days blends into a generic melay making it indistinguishable from other artists. Though hip- hop often maintains originality, the genre can fall to the same fate. Underground Railroad (and the follow up album Stone Soup) are fresh to the point where you want to listen to the whole CD all the way through, not just a few tracks. Do yourself a favor and buy this album."
5,The Boys come back to the Present.,"I thought this to be one of the best coming of age stories. It teaches a valuable lesson, about being happy the way, the where and WHEN you are!"
1,TABLE TOP FOUNTAIN,NICE LOOKING TABLE TOP FOUNTAIN AT FIRST THEN LIGHT STOP FLASHING AND WATER BUILD-UP ON INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF THE BLACK BASE WITH WHITE WATER LINES DOWN THE SIDES OF THE BLACK BOX
3,Beautiful Fountain,"This is truly a beautiful fountain, i purchased this for my sister for Christmas; she loves it. The first one I received had a broken piece. I informed the company & they quickly sent me a new one. I would recommend this for anyone that loves fountains"
1,"32"" Titanic Cruise Ship Model","I have not received this item, emailed the company for help on locating my order the only thing they would give me was the tracking number, and I already had that. I was missing my order. I have requested for return of my money, but have not received an answer yet."
5,A fine Groovy accessory!,"This chair is so cute for the Groovy Girls Dolls. They actually are able to sit in this one without flopping over like some of the others. I feel it is very unfair for this to have received 1 star ratings from poeple who didnt even read what this was for. Its a groovy girl accessory, they did not intentionally make it look like a child size chair, they took a picture of it and thats exactly what it looks like. Some people are so scary!"
1,dont buy it!!!!!!!!!,i thought this was a chair for my grandaugter! it is for a barbie doll. the ad is misleading. unless u want a barbie doll chair dont buy it.......
1,"SF fans, enjoy. Literature fans, keep looking.","Admittedly, Asimov is not often compared to Nabokov or Melville or Bronte, but if you've found yourself wondering why not, this book should clear up the matter in your mind. If you're a lit fan and want to sample the best of the SF genre, you'll do yourself a favor to look elsewhere (like maybe Dune or The Martian Chronicles). According to the forward, Asimov's inspiration for the novel was essentially a self-imposed dare. He inflated it from a short story to convince himself he could still write a novel after not having written one for 10 years and it shows. Characterizations and a story that barely would have sufficed for a short story have been spread to complete transparency over 8th grade prose. The whole thing feels very forced."
1,He Can't Write,"I have to admit that the Foundation Trilogy completely blew me away. Not only was it entertaining, but I loved the idea behind the books, whether or not they are realistic. But I still say he cannot write. He is not Hemingway, Shakespeare, or Austen.This book is the quintessential example of those oh-so-many SF authors who have mediocre-to-great ideas but just can't seem to convey them effectively and beautifully. The prose borders on the quality of high school essays and ""The Gods Themselves"" was certainly not an exception. His ideas were marginally interesting, but the book was written so incredibly badly that I barely got through half of it before I threw it down in disgust. Don't waste your time with it."
1,Really bad,"I picked this up at the library since I didn't recall reading it. What a horrible borefest. It drags on and on and on. Even the first few chapters are completely repetetive. In short, he had a poor three-part short story that he turned into a dreadful three part novel."
4,Whoa...Beyond Intelligent.,"The Gods Themselves is such a...philosophical book. The questions that ran through my head as I read it were not the traditional ""How's it going to end?"" And ""What is THIS character going to do?"" But deep, intelligent questions came to mind like, ""Is it really right to stop something that everyone loves even if it IS destroying them?"" And, ""Is this how gods REALLY act?"" To read this book, you have to be prepared to ask questions like that...this is not a traditional work of fiction."
5,Ingenious,"This is perhaps the most brilliant book by one of the gods of Sci-Fi. The story behind the book is almost as interesting, with a ""washed-up"" Asimov, compelled by the mistaken reference to a non-existent isotope (Plutonium 186) by another author, to come out of retirement to pen an award-winning tour de force. The merging of science and imagination in this book, both at the grand scale and in myriad little details, is humbling. If you ever feel like you could write a good science fiction novel, don't read this. The bar is set way too high!"
4,Classic SciFi,"Very interesting novel. The science was a bit over my head and apparently fairly accurate (in the sense of theories and accuracy). This book- written over thirty years ago- still has some resonance in our times. The theories are just as fair as any we have for our existence. I enjoyed the ""para"" world and its inhabitants- in fact this was my favorite part of the book.The book is not without its flaws, but for a fan of science fiction it was pretty good. As this is my first Asimov novel I can't compare it- but it does make me want to read more of his stuff."
2,For diehard s-f and Asimov fans only,"The Gods Themselves is an archetype of a certain brand of s-f writing: dull prose, cardboard characters, wooden dialogue, lots of pseudoscientific mumbo-jumbo, and even an alien three-sexed species. For diehard s-f fans, it's heaven as Asimov explores the ramifications of energy transferral between parallel universes. For anyone else, it's very tough and unrewarding sledding."
2,I learned an important life lesson from this book,"any value this book has is near completely ruined by the main character. A tour guide on the moon her never ending, never ceasing incessant ranting on her xenophobic viewpoints is laced liberally all over the book. The main character is so unlovable that I would be forced to commit an act of violence against her if stuck with her for more then a few minutes. Anything too stop the jingoist propaganda that her mouth vomits outward at one and all. The sheer volume of her ranting is enough to make one question her sanity.I would say the book did have one important thing to say:the most unattractive quality anyone can ever have is xenophobia and snobbishness. I have learned this lesson from this book and incorporate it in my life."
2,Hugo and Nebula awards? How?,"I frankly cannot believe it won both Hugo and Nebula awards.Terribly boring with stereotypical charcters. Even the aliens whose eating, living, mating, and reproducing habits are completely different from humans, seemed to have emotional and psychological habits remarkably like humans.This is the second book I read of Asimov, and both times, I wondered what the point was to put incredibly typical and mundane characters in an extraordinary situation and make them think and say very ordinary things. Maybe it was newish back in the 70s, I don't know.But the alien life in Part 2, was enjoyable, kind of cute, and fun to read. In order to understand Part 2, you would need to go through Part 1. And if you've read until the end of Part 2, you might as well read it until the end. In that sense, it is a fairly readable book."
5,Tremendouse raelity,"Isaac Asimov is no doubt the finest of all sci-fi writers. The way he builds up completely different realities, completely possible in his mind, and the way he puts these realities to writing, are by all means a heavenly godlike experience. One might actually think he lives in such realities, thus understanding the finest details in every word chosen and all the acting characters themselves."
5,My favorite Asimov novel,"I've been a reader of science fiction and a fan of Asimov for about 45 years. Pebble In The Sky was the first SF book that I remember. I re-read a bunch of his books recently, including the entire Foundation series, and was surprised that they didn't hold up to my memories of them, though they were still enjoyable reads.The Gods Themselves is different. I think it is one of the greatest SF books of all time. His development and portrayal of the alien species is simply unforgettable. His humans have always seemed to me like the humans in the Toy Story movies, not quite relaxed, not as real as the animated toy characters. But he sure gets inside the head of an alien in a perceptive and natural way."
5,"Nostradamus move on over, Asimov has taken over","In yet another compelling novel by one of Science Fiction'sgreats, Hugo and Nebula Award winner Issac Asimov evelateshimself to the level of Jules Verne, H.G. Wells, and AldusHuxley in his prophetic view of the future. While what shallpass may be indistinct, Asimov demonstrates that the scope ofHumankind's role is not: Presented with a boundless sourceof energy, human culture develops at an astounding pace.Scientists, blinded by the infinite rewards of their newfoundpower refuse to consider that what they do -- the soul of theirwork -- is endangering the sun, our Earth, and the entire Humanrace. The fate of billions of humans is within their own handsas they have become The Gods Themselves."
3,"It said ""good dust jacket"" but there was no dust jacket","The book was in good condition as stipulated. However on the website and the packing slip, it said ""good dust jacket"" yet there was no dust jacket. I'm keeping the book but don't like that I can control what I'm getting. That's what the descriptions are supposed to provide to customers."
3,GOOD Science Fiction,"Aasimov is great at being able to explain and teach science through this work and tell a good story at the same time. It was a good story, but it did not particulary appeal to me as being great. I picked up this book specifically from the library, as it is part of Easton-Press' 'Masterpieces of Science Fiction' Collection, and I do not want to spend in excess of $40 on a fine leatherbound edition which I do not consider to be a classic in the genre, and which doesn't particularly appeal to me personally. Instead, I recommend 'Dune', by Frank Herbert, and/or 'Ender's Game', by Orson Scott Card, as being two of the BEST science fiction books I have ever read, and well worth owning."
4,A master from the master...,"Three interconnecting novellas, the middle one being the best and the most ""alien"". Extremely worthy of the awards it won. It's an ""idea"" book and it's a doozie. Read it!"
2,so-so,"I found this book rather irritating to read. The plot is good, but my problem is that every hundred pages or so a new section begins and introduces an entirely new cast of characters which makes me feel like I'm reading a completely different book and also makes it difficult to stay interested. I am really annoyed by this, so that's why I give it 2 stars. I wouldn't recommend this book."
3,Sci Fi at its roots,like meny of azimov's books it starts very slowly but builds speed as it progresses down the paths of two universes intertwined by the need for more energy. a tale of overwelming powers that are to blind to see that destruction might come to there world. an advanture in saving the world all wraped in one book. if your willing to read the slow start its well worth the wait
5,Rooster!,"I love Rooster's music. This is by far one of the best albums I have. I think Rooster are probably a mixture of rock/indie band/pop/ballad lol. All of the songs are great but my fave is probably deep and meaningless but other faves are come get some and angels calling. Whats not to like about them, they sound and look great. :)"
3,"Lots of promise, except...","All the hype and ""rave"" reviews aren't exactly wrong, because these guys have some solid rock, good riffs and catchy melodies... all the stuff you want. But I have to warn you that the album is over-engineered, over-recorded (as in extra guitars, etc) and compressed to make it ""loud"" during the mastering.Forget the technicalities here, it just means you get this wall of sound with every song that's tiring after a while and does the actual song-writing and musicianship an injustice. Sometimes you think, ""Hmmm, there's some drums in there somewhere"". Think Matchbox 20 with grunge.This could have been a great album with a producer who had more appreciation of dynamics and putting a little bit of ""space"" around each instrument. There isn't a nanosecond in any song that they haven't filled with some kind of noise.But these guys will go far, I expect. Good muso's, good song-writing."
2,rooster?,"Unimpressive. The single has the slight ability to make you want to buy the album. But they are just boyband with guitars and trying to break through the market meant for real musicians. Come Get Some, Standing in Line, are okay songs. The others... well, what I recommend, would be you , downloading their songs instead of spending so much on this cd."
3,The 'Caveman' of Cake Like,"Just like everyone else, I didn't know this band existed until hearing them on Viva Variety. Personally, I find this CD to be my least favorite of the three. The style is very raw, but the overall mood is that whimsical, angry-girl mood that I sometimes feel the need to listen to. Generally I prefer singing to yelling, and Delicious has a lot of yelling. The packaging is cool, with the white and silver changing when you hold them up to the light and move the angle of the case a little bit. Its nice to listen to their CDs in order and hear their growth as musicians."
4,Solid Presentation of a Solid Giallo,"This well-crafted 1971 giallo spends more attention on characterization and police procedure than on actual thrills but don't let that deter you. Yes, the gore is minimal but the murders are disturbing and the plot twists pile up to a conclusion that answers the title question in a gripping, beautifully filmed fashion.The scope photography is excellent and the widescreen transfer is sharp, colorful and accurately framed. The mono audio track is a bit 'hissy' but it's more than passable for such an incredibly rare film. Extras are on the slim side with a handful of trailers and nice display of artwork and stills over Ennio Morricone's haunting theme.If you're a fan of the film or the genre then this disc is a definite buy,"
4,Excellent Horror Thriller,"Strongly plotted horror thriller, with a fine cast and excellent Ennio Morricone score. The violence is more subdued than normal for a giallo but still graphic enough to be disturbing. Highly recommended for all horror fans."
1,Not Recommended At All.,"I actually do NOT recommend these vitamins. I took them for only two days and felt horrible including Panic Attacks,Nausea and Dizziness. There is just TOO MUCH crammed into this product. Many people think that since vitamins are good for you, they can't hurt you. That is not true if they are taken TOO MANY at a time and in TOO MUCH of a quantity. These vitamins are made by DRUCKER LABS and are most likely SYNTHETICALLY created, which are the worst kind of vitamins. Save yourself some money and buy a good quality WHOLE FOOD vitamin instead. The benefits will be much greater."
2,DIDN'T WORK FOR ME,"I tried this vitamin with high hopes as it was highly recommended at my health food store.Well, I took this product for about 3 weeks and I just kept feeling worse and worse. I was told that my body must be ""highly toxic"" for me to have that reaction, but I've never had that kind of reaction to any other health food supplement. And I don't smoke,drink, and workout all the time and take lots of supplements.So, I know this product has a great reputation, but I switched to another liquid multi and felt much much better.I guess it boils down to experimentation. We all have to find what works for us. What works great for you may be poison for me and vice-versa.And personally, I think you can find products that are as good or very close for less money."
2,Received 2009 Stock Packed in Dirty Cardboard Boxes,"I was expecting these to arrive in the well-known blue packaging one sees in the retail stores. Instead, I got stock packed in dirty, shop-worn cardboard boxes, dated 2009. Although they appeared to be Schlage knobs, there was another company name stamped on the boxes as well. It makes me wonder if this was old stock that was originally packed for and provided to another company's warehouse. I would have returned them but didn't have time to order more because the installation date on the new doors was fast closing in."
2,disapointed,"Expected multi color or at least colorful it was black and plastic. First time using your services, will probably be my last as well"
1,Gross distortion of facts,"Graber claims that the Armenians who were taken to the Syrianborder either died of disease or exposure, or if not, wereshot and killed at their final destination. What a pack of lies !!These ""caravans"" were all accompanied by gendarmes (police force in the Ottoman empire) to make sure their journeys remained safe and many people survived to tell their stories. The Ottoman Turkish gendarmes did not even cross the border but turned them over to the Arabs or Kurds once the Armenians were out of the Empire's soil. Real-life stories we get from surviving kids (todays grandmas, grandpas) tell us that the Ottoman (turkish) gendarmas were mostly the good guys. As for dying from cholera, typoid, and the like, this was not a plan of genocide rather a consequence of time, and place. Cholera did not discriminate during World War I, it killed both the Armenians, and Turks."
2,Away from being a objective study,"I expected this book to be more objective and more detailed, however it turned out to be more prejudice and the author seems like he doesn't know where he wants to get to. I was disappointed, but you can try it..."
2,Away from being a objective study,"I expected this book to be more objective and detailed, but it turned out to be more prejudice and also the author seems like he doesn't know where he wants to get to. I was dissapointed with this book."
2,Lacking overall understanding of the regional history.,"Is another reincarnation of the lobbying effects of Armenian communities of the US. The book, though heavy reading is light on supporting material. Fails to integrate the Ottoman archives which are the single key source for events of the time. And instead relies on a series of documents which can be classified as war-propoganda documents against the Ottoman by various groups. Alleges that the Ottoman government for no reason at all massacred thousands of civilians but fails to go in depth on the Armenian revolutionary movements or the Rusian Czarist expansionist manuevers.Overall it is not worth reading if you have read any other books on the subject and if you havent it really is not the one to start up on. It does however reflect the one-sided biases plauging stability in the region today."
1,Waste of time...,"I really wander if we will see an unbiassed book about ""so-called"" genocide.Not only biassed, the book has many historical mistakes too. There are some errors even on the chronology of the events during the period 1910-1920.anyway, you're free to buy it since the money is yours!"
2,reignite ethnic hatred,another one of those books with an obvious agenda behind before even the first ink was put down on paper. an aggressive but at times interesting literary style does at times got me going but for people aware of the subject is a piece they will be skimming through with the typical historically revisionist views. there factual historical and numerical errors wrto the historical time period. as long as you dont take it for real history the story line is about average for a historical fantasy.
2,Unfortunately not up to standards,"Graber is well intentioned but fails to present a comprehensive view on the subject matter. Despite initial hopes the reader becomes disappointed with the lack of clarity and confusion of the author, particularly on some very controversial historical matters. Unfortunately, the book is not up to standards. I would suggest another source on this period. Can sell you mine for five bucks..."
2,"Good title, some truth, rest fabrication","A very manipulative look at a very controversial, emotional subject. The steady stream of genocide claiming books will not end as long as we as Armenians take comfort in seeing ourselves as 'victims'. Even though there may be little truth to some of our claims.."
5,A readable history of the Armenian genocide.,"""~There are many dense and scholarly histories of the awful Armenian genocide by the Turkish government in 1915. But, scholarly though they may be, these histories seldom reflect the agony, the pain, the horror of what was inflicted upon a whole people by a militant religion-driven government bent on using World War I as an excuse to kill an entire class of its residents.""~ ""Caravans to History.""""~ Turkish government gave free rein to Kurdish nomads to pillage the Armenian refugees, most of whom were too aged or too young to resist. There are factual reports of how Armenian men, many of whom had enlisted as a patriotic duty as Turkish citizens, were abused and brutualized by the Turkish Army. government of today horrified and ashamed of the Turkish government of the past."
4,A good introduction to the subject,"If you do not know about the Armenian genocide this book is wriiten for you. Concise, clear, and not encyclopedic. If you are looking to a very comprehensive study try Vahakn Dadrian's The History of the Armenian Genocide. Unforgettable- the story, events and characters will stay with you long after you finish reading it."
4,"The author is very detail oriented, and explores all sides","The claim that not ONE British account of the genocide is present is ludicrous. The book has plenty of accounts from ALL sides. Take Page 119: Captain Harry Armstrong, ranking officer is being marched through the desert by a Turkish army unit when he comes across proof. People need to read this book before they make ludicrous claims about it."
5,The author uses great detail and feeling.,"This book is a wonderful account of the life the Armenian people, the hardships they faced, and how they overcame those hardships. I also enjoyed Graber's other books. They had a great amount of detail and showed deeply that he felt the way he wrote. There is much feeling in this book and it helped me to learn more about my heritage. I think that anyone who is interested in Armenia and the Armenians and their culture should read this book. It is touching and moving. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about the struggles and hardships of Armenia."
5,THIS WOMAN'S WORK,"I LOVE THE SONG ""THIS WOMAN'S WORK"" I THOUGHT IT WAS A PERFECT MATCH IN THE MOVIE ""SHE'S HAVING A BABY."
5,No other is like Kate Bush,"I actually purchased this boxset in vinyl when it first came out. There is no set of music that is better. This boxset is very complete and amazing. If it cost $500, I would of bought it. I keep waiting for an artist to come close to this stuff, and none ever has. This music is forever... it has spirit, depth and soul.... when listening to it, you transcend. Music doesn't get better than this."
3,Section 508 Compliancy,"Not the ""How To"" I was hoping for, but a lot of useful information nonetheless. I am responsible for Section 508 compliance at work and deal mostly EI&T rather than the physical applications, but this has a lot of good information as to what to plan for and how to avoid many problems regarding accessibility issues. Worth the price, but use it as a reference along with other publications such as those by Karen MaCall."
3,Thief,"Thief is a sound track for Michael Manns debut as a writer, director and executive producer. Many of the synth sounds are similiair to that of Vangelis and one can definitely hear that the string sounds sound alot like the ones he used on Chariots of Fire. The booklet is quite sparse with a list of their albums and short liner notes written by Mark Prendergast. The cover is a travesty and looks like a high school project. Allmusic gave this album 2.5 stars. I give it slightly better. 3/5."
2,Disappointing,"I found this book disappointing. The stories varied in quality, from pretty good to really bad. The bad ones seemed unpolished, amateurish. Should have been workshopped a good deal, or maybe a good editor was needed. The formatting was strange on my Kindle: one story would end and another begin on the same page, with no warning, often not even a title. I'd start reading a new story, without being aware that it was a new story, the last one had ended. Confusing. Especially since the endings often didn't bring a sense of closure. They just seemed to stop, without having made a point. It's disappointing to feel that excuses are needed to explain the (poor) quality of the stories."
5,Awesome :),"Not only is this stuff great for its intended purpose, it's incredible for new tattoos. Something that normally takes me 10 days or so to heal from has healed in less than a week. Figured I'd try it, since I was out of the normal lotion I'd use .. this stuff is just incredible!"
5,A great book,"I have read all the Jake Grafton books, however this is the last one I have read. I have not been able to get it in hardcover so I bought the Kindle edition.The nice thing about the Jake Grafton books is that you can depend on there will be action and excitement. The good guys always win, but until then things can get hairy."
4,Jake Grafton is born!,"Having lived during that time and remembering the political situation, demonstrations and the way veterans were treated when they came home or even enlisted makes me mad but watching a character like Lt. Jake Grafton bring it to life while telling the day to day trials and tribulations of a carrier pilot and also losing those close to you gives this book a real feel not just a story but a personal story during a hard time for this country.Thank you S. Coonts for hooking me on this American hero, Go Jake!"
5,Meet Jake Grafton!!,"I liked the movie, but loved the book. The book adds drama and detail to a movie that was enjoyable, but not an academy award winner. I'll say nothing about the ending except, thank heavens the book and movie vary, adding an air of unpredictability. What a fascinating read. I felt like I was sitting in the cockpit as Jake Grafton felt his way through the skies trying to do his duty as best as he knew how. From the start, you can tell that Stephen Coonts was an A-6 driver. His perspectives add realism to the fictional character of Jake Grafton, leaving you wondering how much was fiction and how much was fact. I gained an a small understanding of what the navy life may be like for the men and women who sacrifice to serve our country. I recommend this book for anyone who likes to sit back, relax, visualize and read."
3,"ho-hum, but the theme added interest for me","I'm interested in the Vietnam War and air operations, so the book had the right setting. I enjoyed the detaield description of the air planes, carrier, and air operations. The story was ok, nothing special. The movie was far better. The author didn't create interesting characters, nor was I riveted to the book.For those who are not particularly interested in air operations you will probably be bored with much of the detail and find yourself skimming many sections.Overall I though the book was fair, but you can save yourself some reading and see the movie instead.For a great book on the Vietnam Air war try either book by Marshall Michel :The Eleven days of ChristmassClashes: Air COmbat over North Vietnamfor a book on naval air combat during Vietnam tryOn Yankee Station by Tillman"
2,Fairly generic.,"Navy airplanes. Viet Nam. Minor love interest. This one stuck pretty close to form for the genre. It started off a little bit slow, and the technical details were overemphasized a bit. Overall it isn't a book I'll remember a month from now."
1,No More Coonts,"This was the first Stephen Coonts book that I read, and definitely the last. This book seemed to just go in circles. It was slow and didn't seem to develop very well. It took forever to finish, and was I glad that I was finally through it. I read reviews saying that it was action-packed and fast paced - maybe for a total of 10 pages."
3,My Review,"I don't know why, but I had expected more from Flight of the Intruder. I vaguely remembered the movie of this novel from the early 1990's and had the book sitting on my shelf, so I thought that I'd give it a read.Overall, it's not THAT bad, but it's not really that good either. Flight of the Intruder falls smack dab in the middle-of-the-road category to me. The storyline is ok but fairly predictable. The characters really don't have a whole lot of depth and the dialog is really nothing to write home about. Also, for an action/adventure style of novel, the action scenes just didn't do much for me.I wouldn't really recommend this book. However, there is a series of ten books following this character. Maybe it just struck me in the wrong way. I do own one other book in the series, Under Siege, so maybe I'll give it a try sometime and see if that changes my mind. In the meantime, I won't be holding my breath."
5,WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,The classic debut novel of the Coonts/Grafton series will make you grit your teeth and hold on to the seat of your pants as you fly through the trials and tribulations of being a carrier pilot in the Vietnam Conflict. As you read you begin to understand Grafton as if he were real and feel anything and everything that the characters experience like the loss of a shipmate and best friend to a man dying so others could survive. If you want a more exciting ride than this you'll have to be strapped to the nose of a bullet
3,A Perspective of the Vietnam Conflict That Is Sure to Please,"An A-6 Intruder pilot fighting in the Vietnam conflict loses his dear friend as well as his bombardier bombing a ""suspected truck park,"" he decides to attack a target that will make a difference: the Communist Party headquarters in Hanoi. Flight of the Intruder exposes the reader to action, compassion, romance, and humor."
2,unbelievable! no code for download!,"I am new to .net threading and this is the book i could find which is about .net threading. Since there are not much choices,comparisons are almost unlikely.The book is well organized but with one main problem, no source code download. Actually i don't mind there isn't a code for download, because i prefer to type myself. but the author had to make sure all the codes are within the book and all workable.When i read until chapter 2. I found some difficulty.There is a topic about ""Life cycle of Thread"". when i gone thru the ""Interrupting a Thread"" it prompt me error. Then i skip this part and go to ""Pausing and Resuming Threads"". no error but the pause button doesn't work. the thread still continue running even i press the pause button. till i put a break point in the pause button. A little dissapointed hope the author can rectify it immediately"
2,Give at a miss,"I've sat and read the book till chapter 3 and it's so academic it smacks of not being able to think in real programming scenarios. It really doesn't find a way to be jovial and sounds so disinterested in the topic. I've read so many books that do better than this. And, I love reading these type of books but oh god these guys are sooo dry I had take breaks just to sleep :) But... since I have the only book on 'c#' threading to date... I'll keep going... I am really pleased I read the book on books24x7 before I purchased!...Anff"
1,no code support,the vb.net has code support but the c# has not.it is diificult to review the book withouttranslating the vb version to c# to see if the code works
5,Yukon microSD card,"What a great product! I just returned from the Yukon. After using the detail maps and navigation from my GPS, I would highly recommend you not travel without picking one up! It surely is a must!!"
1,very frustrated,"I purely bought this tinted moisturizer to even out my skin tone, since in the summer I thought I'd avoid powder or foundation. I don't have problematic skin, no major dark spots or blemishes, but unfortunately this product doesn't do anything in this regard at all...my face looks the same with or without it... very frustrated!"
5,revolution,"The cush album ""New Sound"" is just that. This project has awakened the spirit of a music landscape dormant since 1994. Music has been dry with no feeling as of late,and now we are all inspired because CUSH has put the mezmerizing joy in music lifting our collective spirits again"
5,Great CD with catchy tunes,This is a top-quality that is all different from mainstream rock. These guys rock with all their songs!!
5,positive,My opinion is not for the shipper. Mine is for Amazon. I don't like to do these because you require way too much typed information!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Not a 4 pack,"I bought this thinking that it was a 4 pack which is says at the end of the title, but only received one in the mail. I was looking for a four pack because they sell 4 packs of other fuses for about $10 at the local hardware, but they don't have the 8 amp in a 4 pack. Instead they're selling it in a one pack for around $8 which seem like an outrageous price for one fuse. Just be aware that you only are getting one fuse, not 4 like the title says."
5,It All Comes Together,"Even die hard John Cale fans have to admit he's a frustrating artist who in admirably resisting pigeon holes has at times made himself decidedly difficult to warm to. On Slow Dazzle however he clearly settled on a genre he liked for a moment and absolutely nailed it. Yes, its possible to argue that by focussing his vision so tightly he deprives the 'true' fan of the eclectic weirdness that characterises so much of his work but on the other hand it does mean he delivers a superbly tight and coherent slab of dark rock and roll. And dark it truely is. Once you've heard Cale's intensly menacing version of Heartbreak Hotel its hard to ever take the original seriously again. Sometimes criticised as too commercial because of its clean and punchy production, Slow Dazzle shines with repeated listenings. The tortured love songs, the twisted narrative, the glorious pop sensability, they're all there. Not so much a slow dazzle as an immediate, enduring, and dazzling tour de force."
4,Glorious,"Sixty Glorious Years is the follow up on the author's book Fifty Glorious Years. Lots of great photos and stories about the world's best aircraft, and the first REAL airliner. A Glorious buy, but if you bought the last book, there's no need to buy this one. However, if you own NEITHER - this is the book to buy. A must for every Total Aviation Person's library."
3,Empire Earth,"Unfortunately this game is a disapointment. Although it combines many of the aspects of other simulation games, it has awful graphics. On the other hand it does cover more time than any other sim game (cavemen to futre). All in all this game is ok if you dont mind mediocur graphics."
1,Empire Earth,"Empire Earth does have great graphics and gameplay, however, in return, it has tons of wonderful problems! Empire Earth ""promises"" things but does not fulfill them (like the night/day cycle in games-but it only works in SOME campaign games ONLY). Furthermore, Empire Earth boasts about its several units in different ages and many buildings. But, the units and buildings are the same almost. It gets boring from time to time. Empire Earth is NOT flexible. You can't change the color of your civ in a single player game, you can only play random games, civs are weird-if you pick the French, they have a british accent(all civ have this accent). Building styles are the same for all; it doesn't change. Tech Support doesn't help. And, don't bother to go visit the Empire Earth Website because they don't update it. This game, I think, is a waste of money."
5,This is the reason Microsoft didn't launch Age of Mithology,"After playing this game, you can forget Age of Empires! This game is awesome! You can start with a tribe in the middle of nowhere in prehistoric times, and end being a super-power of the world with cyber-warriors, airplanes, ships, nuclear submarines... anything you can imagine! And you can zoom-in and out!!I think that after the release of Empire Earth, Age of Empires is now obsolete, and Age of Mithology couldn't challenge it... so, Microsoft delayed the release of Age of Mithology, to improve their game."
1,Empire Earth Ripoff,"I purchased this as a birthday gift, it did not work, upon sending several e-mails, after my husband tried everything they suggested, i ended up losing my money, since it had been opened and cannot be returned. They suggested the problem was with my computer, absolutly not. i got ripped off."
4,Empire Earth,"If you like strategy games, you'll love this one.Strategy games don't get old easily as long as it is classic. We have seen from Age of the Empires. They have values. The endless missions, the awesome graphics, and the okay sounds. Endless units are in this game, from cavemen to cyber machines in the 22th century. This game is all you are going to look for in a strategy game. This game is simply huge! And that's what's so enjoyable about it."
5,Great Game! Absolutely Stunning!,I played the demo of this game and it just blew my mind at first I thought another Age of Empires game but it was even better! I can't wait until I get the real game then I'll fill you all in on what I think of the REAL game....until then i'm leaving you all hanging!So Long...
2,Unbalanced and No Fun,"I have played this game exactly four times. Three against the computer and one online. The computer AI cheats, literally - read the forums on this game - many people have investigated and determined that the computer builds up resources and advances much faster than the human player is allowed to. This amounts to a game where you build your civ for a while, then the computer troops come in and wipe you out before you've even had a chance to accomplish anything. No fun.I decided to try the online play since playing vs. the computer was so unenjoyable. I found snotty ultra-skilled players that wiped me out in under five minutes - again no fun. These people were not even nice - I asked them for tips on how to play and they just sent back nasty messages.So - this game is a total bust. The gameplay is so unbalanced that the player can never get into it in any detail. You just start playing defensively right away and then lose.I regret buying this title."
4,"Great game, improvement on Age of empires",This is a great game. My favorite part is that it got rid of that anouying problem where every five minutes you had to stop mid-battle and go replinish the farms. A game where you can go from pre-history to post-presant is a game worth checking out. A definate must buy.
2,Not much new here...,"I was pretty disappointed. I'd played all the other Age of Kings game etc and was hoping for something new. It's just the same thing over again, still fun to play, but I've had enough of it."
2,It's weak,"My first impression after playing it is, it's lame. The action is very slow. Everything on the screen it too small. Who really cares how good the graphics are if they are too small to see. The voices that repeat continuously when you move a citizen, boat or soldier, really gets annoying fast. I play a lot of AOE and I was really disappointed with Empire Earth..."
5,Empire Earth is a MUST HAVE,"Well from the preveiws this game looks awsome. it is like Red alert, AOE, Civilization, Sim City, and Mechniwarrior all roled into one. From Cave men with clubs to Bunkers with ICBM's This game has it all. Not to mention the 3-D game engine witch none of the other games have except for the Mech's which [is unfortunate]. With Features including Custom Civilizations, 12 Epochs, Historical based Battles and Events (for those history buffs out there), great multiplay online, day and night cycles and seasones, Plagues and disasters, Over 25 Heros, Realistic terrain and battle stratigies, And with over 300 Diferent units and Upgrades, This game Packs a real Arse Kickin. Five Stars. A Really Great Buy!"
1,Lag Unlimited,"Look - I like Real Time Strategy games as much as the next guy. I loved StarCraft, Dune II, Command and Conquer, and their ilk. I loved Age of Empires. So when Sierra (a company I have followed since Ken and Roberta opened shop in the 80's) announced a MASSIVE RTS with all the whistles and bells - I started drooling in anticipation. The letdown was enormous!I have a P4 1.6 GHz computer with a 64 Meg Video Card and a 128 M 3D card with 1 Gig of RAM. ANYTHING should run smoothly - regardless of the number of units or art style. Normally games tend to lag online - it's just a fact of life - you deal with it. BUT TO LAG ON A COMPUTER ABOVE AND BEYOND THE REQUIREMENTS, IN SINGLE PLAYER MODE, IS ABSURD! The art is repugnant, the sprites are rediculous, the gameplay is so incredibly dense, slow and hard, I regret ever having given my money for this tripe!"
1,Expected a smasher...found a crasher,"Bought the game twice, returned twice. Too many bugs, crashes too often. It was fun while you can play, but they should have really tested before release."
5,Much better than Age of Empires,"While Age of Empires only lets you control the far past, Empire Earth includes the past, the present, and even the future. There are a lot of great units which evolve as you progress through ages. The graphics are also much better than those in AOE. It is also full 3D. Also, the different scenarios, units, and structures are historically accurate. This includes the ancient Greeks and Romans, WWI, WWII, and much more. If you liked Age of Empires, you'll love Empire Earth. I highly recommend it."
1,Fails to run in single player without internet connection,"I was unable to play this game after installing it. Once installed, I launched the game, then selected (single player) campaign from the main menu. My firewall popped up with a message saying Empire Earth was attempting to connect to the internet. The game then locked up. I have a dial-up connection that was not connected at the time. Repeated attempts to run the game caused the game to locked up again at the same point (with no error messages, even with internet connection working).If this game needs to have an ongoing internet connection while playing (single player), it should list that as a requirement so customers don't waste their money on a product like this.If you want to play a good RTS, play either Rise of Nations (historical RTS) or Universe at War (futuristic RTS) instead of this game."
4,Great,"It is a fun game and I have liked this game since I was young, I have played it for the last 8 years and I still enjoy playing it even though the graphics are not up to modern standards. Empire Earth 2 offers more options and is also fun, but a lot more complex. I have not played the newer ones, but this seems to be the simplest one and the most fun in many ways."
5,The best rts ever!,"If you'r an age of empires fan you'll love this game!!! insttead of 4 ages that span mabey a few hundred years you get 12 epochs that span 500,000 years!!! Its only weak spot is, heck it hasn't got any. The one thing thats puzzleing is that the upgrade of the grenaider, the doughboy is worse than the grenaider. The graphics are great and it's very relistic. I give it 5, 10 if I could."
1,Too Many Bugs,"There are too many bugs. Yes, the game looks really great, but the game keeps locking up, even after installing all the patches. I tried, but couldn't get Sierra to do anything about it. If I could have tried it before I bought it, I never would have."
3,Installation Woes Continue,"After having seen the advertisements, read the articles, and played the demo it seemed that my purchase of this game was going to be flawless. Once I had it home, I installed the game and low and behold I find I can't play half of the game due to graphics issues. Having placed several calls into Sierra Technical Support, their technicians told me ""We hate receiving calls about Empire Earth since the game was released too early and the platform issues have yet to be ironed out."" So... I've been able to play some parts of the game, but due to technical issues it seems that I have to wait for more testing before I can actually play the campaigns. I'm not the only one with these problems either, based on the message boards.I give the game 3 stars since from what I've seen the graphics, sounds, and interaction look very nicely done. I just hope they get those patches out sooner than later so I can enjoy the rest of the game."
3,:)),"Nice game,but not the best.Comparing to the other games like AOE2 or War Craft III graphics is low.The best thing that i really liked is 16 ages,it's a little bit long time to go though then all,but interesting.Every age new technology.It's a litle bit hard to play against computer.If the graphics was good,so and the game.You should see graphics in War Craft III and compare.I regread to buy this game."
5,Just plain excellent,"I have only had the game for a few weeks, but I can tell I will be playing it for quite a while. Its AOE, Civilization, and Command&Conquer all rolled up. It is well worth the money, especially $20."
2,Better than Age of Empires?,"I was expecting game play similiar to that of Age of Empires as Empire Earth packaging states ""from Rick Goodman, Lead Designer of Age of Empires"". I was quite disappointed in game play and interface. While I thoroughly enjoyed Age of Empires II, I found Empire Earth to be overly complicated. In addition to numerous military pieces, each also had several variables. And remember, that military piece will be antiqued in just a few minutes then you have to learn new ones! Also, trying to keep track of which type of warrior could beat whom is frustrating. It's far worse than the simple scissors, paper, rock. Did you notice the price drop from $49.99 to $19.99? And this game just came out."
5,Best Game Ever,This game is the best game that Sierra has ever came out with. I would highly recommend it!
1,Far too difficult for the average player,"Empire Earth has been heralded as the true successor to Age of Empires, and perhaps it could have been. The game fails on two levels.The first failure is the combat system. The military units represent quite literally an enhanced game of rock, paper and scissors. In this case, shock weapons trump pierce, pierce weapons trump ranged, ranged weapons trump shock... rock - paper - scissors. This is pretty silly.The second failure is the difficulty level. There is no novice or beginer level from which to learn this game. It begins slamming you from the outset with pretty advanced computer AI that individually manages the combat units on the rock-paper-scissors scale while you manage by unit groups and the AI builds up its civilization far faster than the beginning player could hope to.In short, this game is a stunning disappointment for the average gamer. Avoid."
3,The best stategy game!,When I bought Empire Earth i didn't know if it would be good or bad but when i opened the package and started playing it i thoght it was the best!
3,not bad but better age of empire,"Well , i think not bad for playing this game if you already get bored with age of empire , many new features, but lack of visualdetail ( even i am using g force 2 )"
4,"If you get it, it's incredible...if you don't, well...","This game is very impressive in terms of detail, which makes it quite a game. But, the only problem the game has is that, if you don't get it, you won't get it. For people who wanna spend a lot of time playing a game, this is the game for you. As it mentions in the Cons of the game, it is rather difficult. But if you want a challenge, this is it.My only complaint is that unless you have a very powerful computer, you can't have the highest graphics settings, or the game is slow as can be. But if you turn it down to medium or so, it'll work well. And the ability to zoom in and out allows for some awesome scenes. Plus, the fact that the game has 14 epochs, where you can go from caveman to robots makes for interesting gameplay."
2,this game needs major upgrades! and the computer is impossible! to beat!,"this game has bad graphics! the helmets are square for cryin out loud! when you attack, the AI has excellent defences, and can always rout you. i had 300 or so tanks and infantry,and was attacking a settlement close to MY city, but was routed by a combination of AT guns, mortar fire, and helis. and that was with air support! if u dont want to attack, but want to wait for them to attack, youll be waiting for a long time! they almost never attack! and wen they do, its only a single unit or something! the ships, there ok, but i dont like how even in the modern age, the Bismark (a battleship)is still afloat. everyone knows that it was sunk during WW2! dont buy this game unless u hav a slow computer or just want a long game!"
2,It grows on you...,'Empire Earth' isn't the EASIEST game to learn. It actually has a high learning curve. And it doesn't look that GREAT. But there's something about it. All these different epochs you can play in. It is worth checking out now if you can find it in a bargain bin.
4,this is awesome,"This is the best RTS by far.It is easy to control,has good gaphics,and only has a few minor setbacks.It's not to hard,if you think it is it's probably just you."
5,The very BEST RTS game played so far,"Empire Earth is an unparalelled RTS game...I'd always thought Age of Kings was superb but I hadn't known EE.The idea of rising a Civilization from the stone age to the digital era is astonishing and allows you play through out all available eras with their own peculiarities.Graphics are excelent and you can zoom in to view personal details such as outfit of troops or tiles of building roof.You can customize your own civilization or play default Civs such as Ancient Greeks, Babilonians or Germans...I've spent the whole past weekend playing it over and over again.It's 100% addictive...If you loved AOK you'd adore Empire Earth. Guaranteed"
4,A very long game,"This is a great game, the one major drawback is that if you want to do a lot of ""ages"", then you will have to strap yourself in for hours and hours of play.In this game, you collect iron, stone, food, gold and lumber. You can build a variety buildings depending on what age you are.(for example If you are in the nano-tech age, you do not have an ardhery range.)You can make more different kinds of units than you care to count. Age of Empires is the closest thing I've played to Empire Earth and Empire Earth is so much bigger and more packed in.There is a show blood option that can enable or disable the presence of blood, for those who think this game is all about gore. This game is about strategy. How to survive the ages.I recommend this game to anyone who likes Age of Empires."
2,Sucks,"This game was too ambitious. By including so many ages, it spread itself to thin to greatly capture the essense of any particular age. The economy design is a stripped down version of Age of Empires, and it remains the same throughout every age. This game will be fun for kids, but the build build, build, attack, attack, attack game has gotten really old with me.My rating may be biased because I prefer turn based strategy games. I just found this game to be kinda boring."
3,Empire Earth,Although Empire Earth has the potential of being one of the best games I've ever play I have problems with the game bogging down. It's like the system gets overloaded. I've E-mailed Serria through thier web site with little success. I have more than the minimum requirments in order to run the game. It's very frustrating and I hope they fix this problem soon. Great graphics and attention to detail.
2,Nothing Special,"Sorry, very dissapointed. No strategy just a race. Interesting concept but already covered by AOE. One thing I'll give this game is incredible graphics but if you are looking for mind chalenging, strategic planing and military execution this is not it. Just build up as much resources, advance as fast as you can and send your military into your opponents center to rampage. That's about it. I wish someone would come up with a real military combat strategy battlefield experience. Shogun Total war comes close. If they could use the same engine in the context of Roman empire that would be great.Buy Empire Earth after price goes down. Not worth (...)it. This game is mildly amusing. You could say it's AOE part next."
3,It crashes my machine,"I tried installing this game on at least 5 machinesranging from XP, 98 , 2000 and ME and finally managed to make it work on one of the 98 Boxes, The games feels very slow .... .I want my money back or at least compensated for all the time I wasted just trying to install the darn thing.None of my freinds can install it on theirs so we ll be playing Age of empires not this .... I wish they'd released at least in the beta stage not this vapour-ware stage. Shame on you ...."
2,Dissapointing,"I was so excited when i got this game.. I loaded it up asap. I started playing. It was very dissapointing. I loved Age of Empires 2 and expansion, and thought EE would be very good. But as i said EE is very dissapionting. Aoe2 gives me much more excitment than EE. Personally, im thinking bout uninstalling EE, so take this into thinking, Empire Earth isnt very good as you may think it is."
3,empire earth,"looks really cool, though i dont have itit kindov looks like a mix of age of empires and red alert 2"
4,Much better than Age of Empires,"Empire Earth seems like it's a sequel in the Age of Empires series. Seeing as how the lead designer used to work for Ensemble the assumtion seems reasonable.Empire Earth is a lot of game, there are 14 Epoches to progress through: and this lead to some VERY long games if you choose to allow every epoch. The single player campaigns (of which there are four) are very diverse and range in skill level. The game also comes with an amazing scenario editor.Since Age of Empires I and II cover the same time periods as Empire's early epoches, most players will probably find the later epoches more enjoyable. All-in-all Empire Earth is an excellent game, definately worth a look."
4,great allens not sure about the holder yet,"The allens are great nice and long the magic ring works well but the holder will take a little getting used to would have given them 5 stars but the holders are a little awkward, overall, good quality tool."
4,"Overall, very nice.","The hex keys themselves are excellent. The ""MagicRing"" ends up being quite useful when working in tight spaces.As others have noted, the holder is a bit lacking. It lets the keys come loose pretty easily. Also, the metric holder doesn't open quite enough to get out the 5mm key. It can be done with a little extra force, but that shouldn't be a problem.All that said, the holder itself is still much much better than what you'll find with most other sets, and as an added bonus, the holders come filled with some of the best hex keys around."
4,Great Set,"If you are like me when putting in allen bolts, usually they are in a difficult spot to use both hands. This set helps hold the bolt with the Ring in the bottom end if you look at the photo provided by amazon.The only thing that I wish about this set was that it was a standard allen key length. These keys are quite a bit longer than most allen key sets I have had."
5,A Thinking Man's Horror,"Mark Edward Hall creates a thinking man's ""Village of the Damned"" and delivers a rich, complex, and genuinely discomfiting story of good versus evil. ""The Lost Village"" is an ambitious, epic horror opus in the grand tradition of Stephen King, with well-drawn, believable characters and plot twists galore. The images he creates are compelling and detailed, drawing the reader into the terrifying world he creates. A refreshingly intricate read with no easy outs for the reader."
1,Too much like the rest of the stuff out there,"This book is way too long for the story it has to tell. The book drags on and on in many places. The style is too much like S. King, which is over-rated and over-exposed. Your time is better spent doing something other than reading this tedious book."
3,Ray is a great musician but......,"Ray is a great musician, but the singing is .....ugh. Somehow, I guess it worked in the 80's, but now its like you can hear him laughing at his audience."
5,I've only got one more to read!,"I might be the only man to leave a review here so I hope you find what I have to say helpful. The stories were fun! So, yes, you're helping a good cause and you'll get to enjoy it at the same time.My only prior experience with reading romance novels was in college for a class and I hated the story we read. There were so many things wrong with it as a story. Not so with this collection. I thought about just reading the two stories that Kemberlee Shortland wrote since she told me about the book but then after reading hers I started at the beginning of the book and tore through the rest of the it as well. I've got one more story to read before I'm done with it but I didn't want to wait any longer to write a review.So you need not be into romances to enjoy this book because the stories are still good as stories.The only word of caution I have for you parents is that some of the stories are too ""hot"" for my nine year old niece. Read for yourself which ones those are."
2,Freestyle then but not to sure now?,"With the help of Albert Cabrerra, Tony Moran had put an outstanding group in the 1980's called ""The Latin Rascals"" that produced hits like ""Arabian Nights"". But after their breakup in 1988, he had put out some work that had gained much notice with his 1990 solo album. So much notice that his label was signed to Estefan Music which is run by Emilio Estefan, husband of Gloria Estefan. Inspite of his success with artist like Janet Jackson, Whitney Houston, and Celion Dion, this album fails to capture the true ""Freestyle"" flavor that he has. The only song that really keeps its ""Freestyle Flavor"" is the ""Question"" by a Freestyle legend, Noel. All in all, it is a modest effort. If anyone has any questions on Freestyle Music, please feel free to email me at MUGEN0977@AOL.COM"
1,kennan's filth,"His writing lacks coherency and he seems as though he genuinely has no knowledge of the subject, a thoroughly challenging book with no discernable benefit. The conclusion is inadequate and unjust, perhaps he should learn the facts first."
5,My family tree,This is a book of my family tree. I wish I could time travel and meet some of my ancestors.
2,"Not ""Kinship with all life""","I purchased this, having been blown away by the author's ""Kinship with All Life"" - one of my most favourite books in the world, which I cannot recommend more highly. However, this was a huge disappointment - in fact, I didn't complete reading it.However, it may be the perfect read for others - just not for me. It was almost an over-kill of what he explained so succinctly in his first book, and not nearly as enjoyable, or as well written. He seemed to have lost that ability to portray his feelings, to touch his audience where it matters, with this book."
4,Bereaved,"This book is philosophical musings of a man bereft of an extraordinary dog friend, the German shepherd dog movie star Strongheart. Great for anyone interested in Strongheart himself, or dealing with the loss of a beloved companion, or the meaning of life issues."
1,Not worth the paper it was PHOTOCOPIED on!,"I was VERY disappointed with the 'quality' of how this expensive book was thrown together. A loose-leaf binder with an inkjet page glued on the front of the binder containing only photocopied pages of which NOT MANY of the diagrams were even viewable! I bought this book for scale information and the hard-to-find diagrams, most of which I could not even see...."
1,a bit of a disappointment,"A bit of a disappointment...photocopied black-and-white pages in a looseleaf binder. Sure, there is some good information here but no color photographs and even some of the photocopied pages were not very good...it should have been priced at $8 to $10 rather than the $35 that I paid...I must say I'm a bit embarassed to admit that I paid that price...even more embarassed that I didn't demand my money back...oh well, I'm a sucker for space-stuff. I'll just be more careful next time."
5,Love it,"So glad I found this product, I recommend it to anyone looking for an all natural hair conditioning product. Thank you."
5,5 Stars,"I was glad I got the hardcopy version. It differs from the one online in that the editing is not as strong, but it does have a short story and two poems not found on the website. I've read it twice and enjoyed it both times."
3,3 Stars,"Okay, so this book is strange (the narration has a kind of child-like quality) but, I liked the boy meets girl- boy dates girl element. I give it 3 stars."
5,A sad but realistic account of one man's true love.,"Love Story by Erich Segal is a messmarizing story of two people who love eachother throughout their time together. From beginning to end, the wonderful words brought tears to my eyes and laughter to my mouth. I recommend this light, short book to anyone. It can be read in a few sittings, and is worth every penny spent on it."
2,Looking For Love,This book made me think how worthless my life is. I wish I knew this kind of love but without all the swering. If you think you can be my honey bun please e-mail me baby. -I'll be waiting-
5,classic,very quick read. well written and very emotional. not a lot of fluff in the writing. to the point and enjoyable.
3,Mom recommended....,"The book is great and touching, read it in my mom's recommendation and was not disappointed. Was surprised that it was so short!!"
3,Why this book is important,"This book is important for one reason. Let me explain. One of my favorite lines from a movie has been ""Love means never having to say you're sorry"" from Erich Segal's film LOVE STORY because it is so misunderstood. After giving it careful thought, I came to see that love really means ALWAYS having to say you're sorry. I then made the dubious conclusion that Erich Segal got it backwards. After giving it even more thought, however, I came to see that what he meant by NEVER having to say you're sorry is that if you love someone, then you do not need to utter the words ""I am sorry"" in order to communicate your feelings of regret, sorrow, or remorse. A person can communicate a feeling without words. More importantly, if I already love you, then you also know that I care and therefore I never have to say that I am sorry to let you know this fact. I still, however, do like to say those words. I am sorry for going on about this."
1,shoddy at best,"Damn I'm not averse to a good love story, fictional or real, but Segal couldn't write a good sentence to save the love of his life, his eternal flame. Same sort of literary hooks over and over and over and over again ad nauseum. ""Over and over and over and over and over again ad nauseum I said to her."" Yeah ok man whatever. I found this copy in the recycling bin, just happy i didn't buy this rubble. That's how it can afford one star instead of the zero it deserves."
1,Not a real love story,"I didn't enjoy this book at all, of course the end was sad, but this does not make it a good book or any deeper than what i was expecting it to be. Not a good book."
1,Crap,Clumsy and unreadable claptrap for self-congratulatory sold-out Volvo-driving baby-boomers who think buying Ben and Jerry's ice cream means they're rebels. A book only Al Gore would want to be the inspiration for.
5,Hello!!!,"When I reed Love Story at the first time, I coudn't imagine anything better!!! When the end was near, I cried!!! That was so sad!!! Now I shoud do my school work about it!!! Wish me a luck!!! Sanni from Finland!"
2,I don't buy it...,"I was excited to read this novel after having seen it on a list of Greatest American Bestsellers, and having read reviews on Amazon about what a fantastic short novel this was. However, I was very disappointed with the novel when I was finished.I think Oliver and Jenny are just too underdeveloped to be taken seriously. I didn't feel any real love between the two characters, and it felt like everything that happened was very abrubt and was dealt with in very few pages (i.e. Jenny and Oliver getting together, Oliver graduating from law school, meeting the parents, getting married... basically everything that happened!). At the end of the story I was actually surprised that it was over. It wasn't as breathtaking as some people have described it, and it just wasn't that great of a love story overall.If you want to read a REAL love story, I recommend The Time Traveler's Wife by Audrey Niffenegger. That book breaks my heart every time I read it."
1,Not such a love story,I must say I was so disappointed. I could not understand why these two characters would even like each other let alone love each other. The writer seemed like a casual observer and didn't have passion for his creation.
3,Great idea but too short,"I've just finished reading love story and really wish I hadn't read so much about it beforehand. All the hype made me believe I was in for something really amazing. When expectation is so high, a book hardly ever lives up to it and I can't help feeling disappointed. Although I think the plot of the book is great, it is just too short to be really good. The characters are really underdeveloped and potentially good scenes are extremely rushed. I also can't shake the feeling that the writer's heart was never really in it - he was just writing to a formula he knew would sell plenty of copies. To be fair, he has done just that and all credit to him. However, I like a book with a bit more depth where you really feel for the characters."
2,Lacking the emotions of love,"This story was too overrated. I thought it would be a genuine love story--a tear jerker that made you think about love and life in general. Because the 2 main characters were so undeveloped, it was hard to be engrossed by them. Also, their personalities really turned me off. It bugged the hell out of me and was annoying whenever Jenny called Oliver ""preppie."" I thought that was pretty unromantic. Both Jen and Oliver have sarcastic personalities which was not appealing to me. It was an actual turn off. I would have liked more detail, like more description of their love for each other. I didn't like this book too much. I'm glad it was short--I would not have been able to take anymore."
4,For better..for worse,"I am deeply touched by Oliver's love for his wife and vise versa. Their love story proves that true love can shine through not just the best, but more importantly, the worst of times."
2,Hasty and Sentimental,"I read this book when it came out and I didn't then and don't now understand all the hype. The story is told hastily, almost as if the author is rushing through the plot -- almost as if what he had in mind was a screenplay, and wrote a book instead. The characters aren't well-developed. The story is predictable. And, it is mawkish: sentimental in a feeble way. Feeble because the characters seem two-dimensional and the ending is not satisfying."
5,Such an amazing book!,This book was brought to my attention in a class I was taking - a few pages were given to us on a print-out. This make makes understanding Buddhism so much easier than anything else I have read. Definitely recommend this to anyone who is trying to get in to Buddhism. You'll love it!
4,Good book,I have read a lot of Buddhist books (and go to Buddhist classes) and I really enjoyed reading this one.
5,fresh thought,there's some thought that never cross to my mind but the author can reveal it .the middle part of the book start to make me think more deeply.
1,More social commentary than buddhism,"I found the author succeeded in being provocative- he continually annoyed me throughout much of the book, from his basic misunderstanding that all emotions are painful, to his incessant grousing about the shortcomings of western (mostly American) civilization.He stands in stark contrast to a skillful teacher such as Thich Nhat Hahn.If you want to be annoyed or perhaps entertained, depending on your world view, then this is the book for you, even though you won't learn much useful about the dharma."
3,"My cat said, ""Yuck!""","I think my cat is strange compared to other folks' cats because he just doesn't like this stuff. He ate two bites of it and that was it - he wanted something else. Most cats really like these pouches so may I suggest trying them anyway to see if they work for your cat. Mine isn't that finicky when it comes to his food, but these fish ones in particular seem to really bother him. My previous cat didn't like them either so maybe I just am the odd man out here."
1,Arizona Prayed to God for an ACL tear...,"...and they got it! The University of Kentucky, looked forward to a potential repeat in 1997, led by their two superstars, Ron Mercer and Derrick Anderson. Unfortunately for the Wildcats, Anderson went down early in the season with an ACL tear, leaving Mercer to shoulder the load the entire season. At the Final Four, Utah utilized a very physical style of play in trying to eke out a win against the Wildcats, who had beaten them in the NCAA tourny in 1996 (and would do so again in 1998). This physical game left Mercer drained for the championship, giving Arizona the break they needed to take the 1997 NCAA Championship. As viewers, we were robbed of an outstanding matchup in seeing Derrick Anderson (The man Michael Jordan said he hates to have guarding him) defending against Miles Simon, who had a career game that day. This video neglects to mention these keys that allowed Arizona to win the tournament in 1997."
3,Good Bag weird Strap,"The bag is really nice, though one of the shoulder strap clips is placed on the opposite side from where it should be making it very weird to hang correctlly.Great bag though! very happy!"
2,Just interesting,"I'm not a Sigur Ros fan, but I have a great respect for their music. Both Cd's are good, the disspaointed was the Blu Ray. There's two parts, one from the old times and one newest. The old one has a awful video quality but good audio (DTS HD). The newest has better video qualityI (as everybody expects) but the sound is just 2.0 pcm!!! I really can't understand why we can not has a great video and great audio?? Why?? Anyways the performances are right."
2,Scanned by Robots ...,"This is a publish on Demand book. No pictures and obviously scanned using a robot (as it states in the introduction of the book). Most of the charm is lost in robot translation let me tell ya.I do, however, recommend you pick up any of the other Old Mother West Wind books still available on Amazon.I also purchased Mother West Wind's Animal Friends, and it is a keeper. Mother West Wind's Animal Friends also includes the original illustrations.My mother's collection of the Old Mother West Wind Stores are the books I learned to read on as a child and I intended to use the newer editions to read to my Grandchildren. But I'll pass on any more versions of the ""generic, robot typed"" books."
4,Burgess' Original Classic,"Ah, the book that started it all in Thornton Burgess' series on the animals of the Green Meadows and Green Forest areas. This book tells short humorous children's tales of characters such as Peter Rabbit, Reddy Fox, Jimmy Skunk and Sammy Jay. These stories are all tied together with the presence of any original entity: the merry little breezes, who are children of Mother West Wind. The merry little breezes fly around and observe all the fun and mischief that all the forest creatures get into during the day, and sometimes even help those that are in trouble.Each chapter is only 2-5 pages long (perfect for bedtime reading), and has a valuable lesson that parents will appreciate. I, as an adult, find this book very appealing as it talks about nature in a fun and educating way. I'm sure children will like this too.Darien Summers, author ofThe Mischievous Hare, a children's book."
4,Toyah's debut & masterpiece,"Toyah burst on the scene at the start of the 80's with this idealistic mish-mash of raw punk-pop. An excellent album, it opened the eyes of the music press to Toyah, even if her promise was only to reap dividends for the publishers on release of the 3rd album, Anthem. True fans still cherish Sheep Farming & The Blue Meaning as the Toyah that she intended us to hear, and we still enjoy these over & above the more commercial titles. Sheep Farming doesn't possess the artistic production of later albums, but Elusive Stranger has the eeriness, Victims... the angst, & Our Movie the oddity that made Toyah a supreme success & the best lyricist, I believe, that music has seen in modern times."
4,The Real Toyah,"Many people have heard of Toyah from her hits ""I Want to Be Free"" or ""It's a Mystery"" which aren't representative of most of her quirky new-wave oft sci-fi tinged euro-pop. If you've heard ""Ieya"" then you've heard the Sheep Farming Toyah. This album, which I've understand is a compilation of a couple of projects, is a dark, occasionally angry, and compelling song-cycle of birth, life, and death (from ""Neon Womb"" to ""Danced"" to ""Victims of the Riddle""). The whole albums very listenable, with Toyah's quirky multi-faceted delivery showcased. Discover Toyah's intelligence and be amazed. BTW, the Great Expectations release PIPCD 014 sound quality is not anywhere near that on the Connoisseur Collection, be forwarned."
3,Unusual and stirring at times,"I had a difficult time lassoing my mind around The White Hotel, a poetic, tragic and sometimes ponderous story of a young singer's psychosexsual dilemnas and relationships. Curiously fixated on the personal and professional meanderings of Sigmund Freud (especially the first half), the story is mainly about a talented singer as she grows from adolescence into the Autumn of her life. It jolted me to find the story ends with the Holocaust, in which our heroin finds herself in the clutches of the Nazis. There are generous amounts of poetry and letter-writing in The White Hotel; and at times it seems unneeded and gimmicky. Overall, a very sad and thoughtul book, but the story is sloppily rendered because the organization is so bad."
5,Powerful reading.,"I loved this book! Once I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down. I am a vegan and big supporter of Farm Sanctuary and I learned so much more about farm animals. I bought several copies of this book to give to my non-veg friends to read. It is very powerful, just as his other books are. His insight into animal behavoir and emotions is remarkable. I like the way the book is divided into to each animal species. A must read!"
4,Nice Read on Farm Animals,Gives a good and imformative read on the lives that farm animals lead. It includes both their emotional and physical lives and brings into the view the disconcerting truths of farmed animals.
2,No substitue for science,This book substitutes anecdotes and conjecture for science. It is obvious that the author is more interested in spreading his biased point of view than he is in providing any subjective information.
5,Brilliant!,"Fair warning: If you've ever felt even a little disquieted about your relationship to the beings we eat, Jeffrey Masson explains why. You will no longer be able to view chickens, cows, and pigs as mere meat units, somehow ""less than"" dogs, cats, and baby seals. This book may challenge and shake your assumptions and lead you to ask yourself if it is possible to refer to yourself as being an ""animal lover"" while being an animal eater, particularly when the methods used to produce, raise, and ""process"" meat animals (and eggs) is often indescribably cruel. At the very least it may spur you on, as it did me, to advocate for Ethical Eating; an end to factory farming and inhumane slaughtering methods (""google"" shackling live chickens). An inspring and evocative read. Mt Masson continues to be animal's best friend."
1,The Pig Who Sang to the Moon,"This book is a must read for all. It will open your eyes to the suffering of animals to your health and to our environment. I recommend ""The Face on your Plate"" by: Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson as another good book."
1,What a POS!,"Wow, what a POS this dvd turned out to be. I actually felt bad for the actors that were in it. The storyline was horrible and laughable at the same time. All that being said if you must watch this I will give you a couple positives. They could have turned this into a whole season instead of just a hour and a half so be thankful for that. Also, not to give anything away something unexpected happens that really is a game changer. I liked the series and watched every episode but this was a joke and a half. Only dvd extras are 2 bonus scenes...that's it. You have been warned."
5,Prison Break: The final break,Was the final edition to my collection of Prison Break - product was great quality and very quick shipment
5,Great tie in to series finale,"This movie is ideal for the fan that has seen the entire series from the begining and was wondering what really happened in that six months that was skipped over during the series finally. It certainly answers a lot of questions (What actually happened to Michael, what happened to Gretchen and so on. If you are looking to buy this thinking it is a ""cliffs notes"" version of the series, save your time and money, otherwise, it is a great addition to any fans collection."
2,Short of Epic Failure,"As a longtime fan of PB I had to pick this up when it first came out,unfortunately I was highly disappointed with the overall writing and ending..to be honest it's not worth collecting because the original season finale is sufficient enough."
2,The Final Break. Prison Break,Quality and product was good. However the movie was not. I crammed what happened in all of a previous season into one episode. Everything that happened was just to crazy however of course it worked out except when Michael died at the end. They should have left it at the end of season four instead of adding on this last bit.
5,Feedback,I ordered the movies and it only took 1 day to get here. I will most definitely order from them again.
1,Serious? Worse script ever!,"C'mon, this was serious? A DVD for 2 episodes that do not answer NOTHING?First, we can't see if Michael is really dead and, this was the worse idea EVER to kill the protagonist and ""hero"" of the show.Second, how Sara got her freedom? She is a fugitive now!4 years of answers was said, and nearly 1 month passed in this episodes!With this DVD you murdered this fantastic series and destroyed the good memories. Everyone who really enjoyed Prison Break, will be pissed with this DVD.My personal recommendation is: If you really enjoy Prison Break, don't watch this..Not worth it. It only furthers the story, without any decent answer or shocking final."
2,"Repeat of Season 4's Episode 23's ""The Old Ball and Chain/ Free","This ""Final Break"" is the exact version as Season 4's Episode 23.Of course this film is thrilling; I'd give it a FIVE STARS!!Just realizing it's the same thing with a different name and then I'd have to pay for it; is kind of frustrating.I love all the actors and plot is awsome!Thank you FOX for this great action experience!!"
1,Lousy end for a great series!,"Totally agree with Nora Lamy.If we were supposed to just get a rush from the wild ride on the roller-coaster of this plot and series then the ending was like slamming into a concrete bridge abutment at 90 miles an hour!There is no logical reason that after all the sweat and tears, that there could not have been a happy ending. Yes, this was a skillfully crafted work, but it makes this viewer wonder now if it was worth the investment in my time and money!"
2,Very disappointed fan,I bought this DVD in the hope that the writers would redeem themselves after that awful series finale and show us that Michael had to fake his death somehow but is enjoying life with his family after all. Boy was I wrong. It just brought back all the frustration I had after watching the series finale. The writers totally got it wrong AGAIN!
2,Prison Break saga continues...,"As usual, the writers spent minimal effort with creativity - although I have been a fan of the series since day one, I was a bit disappointed with this mini movie - they could have made a season out of it (aren't they pros at stretching ? :-) ). Perhaps it was a nice way to explain a few things; however, I felt a separation from the regular episodes and this feature film. The acting was ok and it felt more like a reunion show. I think it is still worth seeing (who can't live without those 3 seconds predictable twists?). If you are a die hard fan go for it, otherwise wait for FOX to air it - for once, I think it was pretty much right on the money. Spoiler alert: at least, one of my favorite characters, T-Bag lives on his fate and lives happily ever after!"
2,"bad, just bad","loved prison break, once upon a time. me and my girlfriend watched this and as soon as it was over we just laughed at how horrible it was. we couldn't decide which was worse, the acting or the script. even if u are a fan of this show there is really nothing noteworthy here, and definitely NOT worth $20, heck not even worth $5."
4,the end,I absolutely loved this series and couldn't wait for the Final Break. As usual there is a lot of action along with twist and turns. I think it was a great value but I was a little disappointed with the ending.
4,A Good Finale,This DVD is definitely worth seeing if you were a fan of Prison Break. They made it well and in my opinion is better then Season 4. I am really happy I bought it.
5,Prison Break The Final Break,"Prison Break is an awsome show. It's action packed from season 1 all the way thru to the Final Break. I highly recommend this show. I just wish it was still making new seasons, this is one show that needs to be brought back. I love to watch the reruns when ever there on."
1,Additional Post Series Finale Episodes,i am thinking this is not a divided Season 4 set but the 2 additional episodes that have been taped post-Season 4. It will probably be a 2-hr movie event although an air date has yet to be scheduled by Fox.
1,Horrible writing of unbelievable script,"As a disclaimer, I've never seen the tv show. We rented this as a stand alone. The plot was trite and unbelievable, full of people doing things that no person would ever do. Plus the lame, cliched bull dikes on steroids routine in the ""Bitchs' Wing"" of the prison. Even fast forwarding through much of the appalling dialogue wasn't enough to keep this show painfully dragging for what seemed hours."
5,prison break ending,im sure the movie is worth watching and will answer lots of questions... and perhaps find out Michael is still alive
5,Best Prison Break episodes yet...,"Just finished watching this, and it is by far the best PB episodes ever. It ties everything up and leaves nothing undone. This happens right before the 4 year time gap at the end. Prison Break fans MUST see this."
3,Disappointed in Final Break,"I bought the entire series of Prison Break DVD's because I loved the show when it was on and Seasons 1-4 were fine. Prison Break, The Final Break, is only 1-1/2 hours long. The whole DVD is that long! They could have included it with Season 4 but to spend another $25 for the last DVD that was so short irritated me. Plus on the show at the end they showed Lincoln etc. went back to Panama to be with his son and that wasn't on this DVD. I know you have to buy all 5 to watch the whole series but I was disappointed that they only put the last 1-1/2 episode on a separate DVD."
3,Good...but unhappy with the ending.,I watched every episode of every season and enjoyed it all. I only regret that they didn't end the story at the beach on the final episode of season four. I'm left feeling that after many hours of faithful viewing I am walking away unfulfilled and quite disappointed. They never wrapped it up properly!
2,"Ho-Hum...Nonsensical plot, good for die-hard fans...","Plot has plenty of holes....doesn't pass any reality/common sense test at the basic levels. I won't give the plot away, but only say that it is bad enough to spoil the movie. They could've done much better with only a little bit more effort.Fortunately, Amazon allows resellers...I sold my copy immediately after watching..."
2,Not much to write home about,"If you've seen the end of Prison Break's Season 4, you already know how things turned out. This add-on, composed of two episodes that weren't aired in the U.S., fills in the gap.If you're a die-hard fan who enjoyed Season 4, this is for you. If you thought the series went downhill in Seasons 3 and 4, you might want to see this anyway, but you might want to rent it rather than buy it.The story is as contrived as the rest of the series, but with everything pressed into 90 minutes of action, it goes by so fast you can't really enjoy it. Season 1 might have been this bad if it had been only 90 minutes long.The story opens with the wedding of Michael and Sarah. Two minutes later, at the wedding party, Sarah is arrested for murder. You can take it from there.It's watchable, but since you already know how it all turns out, not that exciting."
3,Works fine but not great,"It worked well overall but...The device does not heat evenly, the center is hotter than than the ends. The stone easily becomes stained."
4,hard shoes,"I ordered these shoes for both wearing when I do certain types of work, if I go hiking, and when the weather may be rough. I have only worn them once and probably will not wear them too often, but I like them as a pair of dependable shoes that will protect my feet when I need that."
5,A classic tale of love and devotion,"This book is a classic tale of love and devotion. Belle gives up her freedom for her father, and is willing to do it again for the Beast whom she once hated. A woderful retelling of the French folktale."
1,The Worst of the Worst,This book was so bad...I used it to level off a table in my garage that I keep my tools on. Part of the reason is a guy named Scott Maiko. Is there any redeeming quality to this book?
5,Addicting,"i have spent a lot of hours playing this game and its awesome. grapics, game play difficulty interface, system requirements...everything. what i mean by System requirements is that its got great graphics for a game that doesnt require a high end computer. of cource you have to have diablo 2 to play the expantion. it only adds one more act, act V. if you pick this one up, you'll enjoy it, but you might want to say bye to everyone you know cause you wont see them again till youre done with this one, its that good...well atlest i think."
2,Buyer Beware,"While this is indeed a good game, it is too highly addictive. If you are looking to find a game in which you mindlessly play for hundreds of hours, this is it. I was totally into this game so much so i did one of the stupidest things one could do, bought items for a game on ebay.Another very annoying portion of the game is the online. While free is a very compelling insentive, there are drawbacks. Constantly not being able to join games that you are making, constant lines to make games, and above all, the hacks. the hacks make the game unbalanced and irrating in fighting.I HAVE PLAYED FOR AT LEAST A YEAR AND HACKS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN PRESENT, MANY OD THE SAME HACKS. (hella days since the last update)I COULD HAVE GOT A JOB AND ACTUALLY MADE HELLA BANK IN THE TIME I HAVE PLAYED IN THIS GAME.IF U DO WANT TO BUY JUST LOOK BACK EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE AND ASK YOURSELF, WHY DO I PLAY?"
5,Worth the wait,"Most of the new features are minor but do add up. Since D2 was all about killing the minions of evil and finding new and powerful things, the expansion does more of that better. There are new items to find, new ways to customize items and many things have gotten a boost. Such as how worthless socketed items were. Now when you collect the right runes in the right order you can make a powerful unquie out of a socketed item. In ways like this it makes the gameplay fresher and more interesting.Even with new features and imporved old ones, it still plays the same. This is good if you liked the basic concept to start with, but while it's lack of complexity makes it enjoyable, it would be nicer if there were more to it."
5,be careful,"...For one, the correct class weapons are:Necromancer-Totems Barbarians-Helms Paladin-Shields Amazon-Bow Spears, Javalins Assassin-Katars Sorceress-Orbs Druid-HelmsJewels arent like gems,they have magical mods (prefixes and suffixes) instead which just get given to the item they are socketed into.Only certain things can have 6 sockets, not everything, and uniques and rares can only have 1. And still no boots/gloves/belt/jewelry sockets.A bunch of the names of runes he gives are wrong.Most charms are 1x3 or smaller, none are larger.Glad i could help :) as far as my opinion of the game (or expansion)... well of course it rocks"
1,diablo II,"...this lousy game STILL runs slow... unless u have the super computers used at space shuttles dont bother geting this game......ALSO, THERE IS A BUG IN THE GAME WHERE PEOPLE CAN STEAL UR PLAYER ON BATTLE.NET"
2,"This isn't exactly a BAD game, but...","I used to play D2:LOD. A lot. I mean all the time. There wasn't anyhting wrong with playing this game so much, it was free and it was fun. After a while,though, it just go SO BORING. The same levels and stuff, over and over and over again. Sure, you can makea new character. Big deal. You're still not doing anyhitng new and interesting with the game. You're just seeing the same sights in a new suit. I recently purchased Everquest and even though there's a monthly payment, I truly beleive that it's worth it."
1,"A horrible addon, for a not so good game in the first place.","I just didn't like it...more clicking....oh yay....don't waste your money on this junk, but since your probably won't listen anyways...whatever."
3,Not up to par,I own every Blizard game ever made and I have never been as disappointed as I was with Diablo II and the expansion. It is exactly like the original with nothing to offer that would make it worth of the original. So save you money and look to anouther game. This is the one Blizard game I wish I did not own.
1,updated to make sure you die alot,"I had a lot of fun with this game until they ""updated""it to make sure you die alot and have to spend all the money you don't lose when die to buy healing potions I am selling my game and getting something else to play."
5,"I play this everyday, im an expert","I play this game all the time, im one of the godliest people on US East Hardcore. So much fund dueling and trading other ppl. I enjoy the social aspect of this game and the player vs player a lot, loads of fun to scam people too."
2,"Nice game, but don't get excited","So , it's coming... I must Admit I've been waiting for the expansion pack with a lot of anxiosness. I understand Blizzard have made a fine job in making this game. The thing that really bothers me is that (again) for playing under WINDOWS 2000 , I _WILL_ need Administrator rights. I believe this to be a flaw in Diablo 2 , and I'm dissapointed Blizzard aren't doing anything to correct it. You see , the thing is , that while gaming on Battle.net , one is online constantly.And in case of a bug (or a hacker interference) the whole system will go down , if someone is logged as an Administrator. And I'm not sure if i'm willing to risk my computer's stability for a pleasant gaming experience.Are you?"
3,"Ok game real exciting, but TOO MANY HACKERS!!","I really liked this game. I played it for about 2 months, but then all those stupid hackers. God D@&% thats just plain stupid just letting people download hacks on the internet so they can hack into your account COME. ON BATTLE.NET WHY DO YOU DO THIS @ ME!!!!!!!!!"
4,Lod and the fun it will be,"I got the beta for LOD and it rocks, the two new characters and all the new items in the game are going to make it way fun for the hardcore D2 fans."
2,Disapointing,"PLEASE NOTE that blizzard has effectively removed Gambling for Unique items in this expansion set. Which for most of us was the source of most entertainment in the game.As for the rest of the expansion pack: Act 5 looks fantastic, for a while any way. But takes at the most 1 day to complete and realy does not justify the [price] bones it cost. Seems alot more of the same, and you will quickly run bored with it.Spend the money on some other full featured game rather then on this last excuse to run D2. Wait for Max Payne to come out if you can."
4,Little much aint it?!,"If you thought you finally had Diablo 2 mastered think again. Blizzard has released the expansion and this totally makes Diablo 2 sooo much harder. Nightmare and Hell modes are incrediably harder!! So many more items with all new stats you wount be able to keep up. New characters are ok but not well balanced skill wise. Druid stick with wolf. Summon, bear, and elemental abilities aren't to good. Assassin has some ok skills but the good ones aren't the ones you get at Level 30 so becareful where you put your skill points.Have fun!!"
5,REAL review,"Most of the reviews that i have just read were not helpful. The expansion to Diablo 2 is a vast improvement on the most part from the classic game. Lord of Destruction adds many new possibilities by adding 2 new character classes, bringing the total to 7, and thousands of new items. These new items include such things as runes (artifacts that fit into weapons, helms, armors, and sheilds to make powerful uniques if done correctly), charmes (which can be held in your stash to give you bonuses the same way rings and ammys do), and many new character-specific items. Although many believe that the just released patch was made the MAKE people buy the expansion, this is a blatant lie. The version 1.08 patch updates classic Diablo 2 to be more like the expansion so that not everyone has to buy the expansion to get some of it's updates. I encourage everyone that has played or does play Diablo 2 to purchase Diablo 2: LoD."
4,Single player mode is great; muliplayer has problems.,"Ah, chapter V of the Diablo II world is finally played out with the expansion pack. Two new characters are added, items are changed and storeage space is increased -- but you'll need that once you win and start up nightmare or hell level. We can play it between our computers at home with with friends on-line but when we do the graphics get a little jumpy. The previous problems with assistants getting stuck in a pacing pattern continue."
4,Definite fun,"This game is just way too fun. If you loved Diablo 2, then you'll definitely love Lord of Destruction. There are plenty of new features- it adds a new twist on the Diablo experience. There are a lot of improvements- better hireling interaction (you can equip and resurrect them), more hotkey settings, and buying things got a lot easier too. As for extras, LoD has tons of them- more unique and set items, tons of new horadric cube recipes, crafted items, runes and rune names, all these in addition to the two new character classes."
3,"Great game, but then again...","ok, why the low rating? Well, this game is extremely unbalanced. If you play this online, most likely the reason why u keep playing is that u r hunting for items to sell on ebay. This is truely sad sad thing to see. People now adays only play this game for its items, not for the game itself! well, the game dun have much of itself.Online Players are rude, and they will try to scam you for ur account to get ur items. No security at all. People hack, duplicate items and sell it on ebay. This game brings out the worst in people. Play it if u r a fan of Diablo, the CG movies are excellent! But i won't recommand you to get to involve in its Multi Player option."
5,game rocks like doom 3 and half-life 2,this game rocks. its better on the online and its not a waste of money. i got good chars with high lvl weapons and kicking sets. online is never boring and some people can be total dicks or friends. the only problem is that it doesnt let us use our spells and skills in town. :)buy this game along with doom 3 and half-life 2. these games are great and worth money. i dont like to say this and start rumors but they are makeing a half life 3 and expansion for half life 2 and if u heard already this well dont bitch and if u think this game sucks go play hacky sack or that totaly gay halo 2.so peace out.
2,OH MY GOD IT SUCKS! like daiblo 2,I am sooo un happy with these two games easily to say i think they [aren't good]! graphics [aren't good] and ok wow we get a lot of armour and weapons.... that look the same! .... it looks like the same graphics as the first game!!
3,"game: love it, marketing stratigey: hate it",I love Diablo 2 it is my favorite game but blizzard just relessed a new patch 1.08 which completly screws up the game. Blizzard has made some outragous claims that this patch enhances game play when really (in my point of view) this is just a ... to get us to buy the xpack. That makes me mad. plus the put the price at .... ive been trying to get ... for the past week and i havent got it. soo im stuck here trying to get money from my perents adn still dont have the game.
3,"Good, but...","Ok, I've been playing this game for over a year now. It was realy good untill they patched it a few times. It used to be that rare items were better then uniques, but it's back wards. The people that you can play are unbalanced, and there ae hacks every where, you don't know what your getting, a dupe or a legit item. I'm not saying that it's a bad game but Bilz has made a lot of disapointing changes to the game lately. I used to want to go and play on B.net all the time, but now I don't care if I do that or mow the lawn. Maybe it's because that I'm in need of a new game. Well, I hope this helps."
3,More click click click click click,"This expansion adds two new classes and one new chapter. Of the two classes, the Assassin is ridiculously overpowered but consequently a lot of fun to play as long as you're not looking for a challenge. The Druid is good but almost seems as if three different incomplete xcharacter ideas were taken and smooshed together to make one complete one. The new chapter has some interesting new quests but in the end it just boils down to a new background to click your mouse on over and over and over and over."
3,I Quit Playing Soon After,"I was a hardcore fan of Diablo II and had been playing for several months. So when they announced this expansion, I went ahead and pre-ordered it online. I actually thought that Act Five was pretty decent. I liked the new characters, the Druid and the Assassin, as well. However, pretty soon, I stopped playing the game. I had played all the characters, Battle.net was always slow and choppy, and I already knew everything that happened, so the interest really wasn't there anymore. Please, take your money and buy a brand new game. Buy one of the Final Fantasy games. Buy anything other than this unless you're a really major fan and you just can't stand not to see the new cinematics, characters, acts, and other items, and reading about them online just isn't doing it for you."
2,disappointed,"bought it, played it for about 40 hours of game time, went back to classic. LOD is just too equipment driven, you can build a high level char, but if his equipment is not godly, he's no better than the NPCs. I do like the new resolution, but it seems a lot of money to be able to play classic at 1024X728."
4,BUY NOW!!!,"ya soo the main game isnt that good. Try battle.net its soo tubular! ok. Plus the prices here are so good you gotta buy. Theres like millions of diffrent items here including armors, weapons, potions, jewels, and more! These blokes mean bussiness!So you can't miss out. Warm up yur fingers cause this is one hell of a ride."
2,More of the same. Really.,"You get ONE more level, as opposed to the four without the expansion, and two new character classes. Unless you like playing new characters in 80% of the same old, 20% new, arenas, it's really just a little more of the same stuff. I'm sure they could have added this expansion onto Diablo II with no problem, but then they wouldn't have gotten the extra $. You really have to be into this game to think the expansion is worth it. I like the game, but not that much."
5,This is one of the best game.,"I played all of the episode including. Diablo 1, Hell Fire, Diablo 2, and Diablo 2 Expansion. I hope that they are going to release a new Diablo which is Diablo 3."
3,Good but...,"I got this game and loved it. Lots of new extras and two new charecters. But, the problem is how the game ends. Its a big let down. I had hoped for more. All in all not a bad game and worth the price, but it could have been better..."
5,mmmmmmm.............,BUY THIS GAME IT IS FUN BY YOURSELF OR WITH MULTIPLE FRIENDS OVER THE INTERNET!!!!!
3,What have they done?,"Been playing Diablo since the original game came out and of course, very addicted. Not to happy with the expansion though. Price tag pretty high for what you get, but as usual Blizzard has out done themselves on graphics, much slower than before. Also one day as an amazon I could use 2 arrows to kill a bad guy, next day after patch upgrade on battlenet took six to kill the same bad guy. Don't know what there doing to the software but I have found it generally dissapointing except for graphics."
3,so-so,"This particular batch of remixes is quite different that previous NIN releases. While it displays a new direction for their music, it not a direction that I, for one, find especially interesting. The songs are definatey even more mood-music-based that previous work, and at times are just too noisy and unfocused to be enhancing or enjoyable."
4,I never thought this Album could be so good.,This album is a almost a perfect recording. I wonder if there's a better NIN work than this.
3,For Big Reznor Fans Only,This is a trippy album of remixes that goes better with some herbal enhancement. Many of the songs bare little semblance of the originals and detour into unexplored territory. I only can make it through this one with a little help.
2,Not worth going down this far,"2 1/2Even if fans of NIN's more abrasive side enjoy these bloated remixes oif choice tracks from TDS (there are a few choice remixes where the artist reworks some of that great disc's textures effectively), Reznor's insistence on repeating himself throughout exposes this as a cheap cash-in off of Spiral's critical and commercial success."
5,Greatest Remix Album Ever Made,"This, by far, is the best remix album ever created.All the remixes still have the darkness that made the Downward Spiral so unique. The remix for Hurt was perfect. Trent just added a few touches which kept it like the original version, but I have to say that the Mr. Self Destruct remixes were the best on the album.This CD is well worth the money and it's great for anyone who loved the Downward Spiral."
3,"Okay, but not extra specially sugar coated","Um, this will turn you on, if you are heavily into remixes, but more importantly, heavily into Trent Reznor. My impression of the cd is that there is nothing altogether new being explored here, there was nothing substantial that i got from this cd except for the eraser(polite) version which is really good. As for the rest of the songs, they are variations on a theme, that don't break any innovative ground, but seem to repeat the same theme of the album."
5,no one can,This was an album I have been waiting on. This is the album I have waited on. Waiting on the album...
4,"Really good, but not Trent's best","Trent has one of the most beautiful voices in music today and while this CD is good it doesn't really showcase Trent's talent. I think The Downward Spiral and Pretty Hate Machine are better, but this is nice for a little bit of a change."
3,Interesting reinvention of some impressive tracks,"With only three good tracks( Piggy, The Downward Spiral and Hurt ) this CD is really more of a collector's item for die-hard Nine Inch Nails fans. If you're new to this group I would suggest getting The Downward Spiral instead."
1,It's so god-awful it's funny!,"Surely Trent Reznor is kidding us, right? Is this the most immense satire on self-absorption and self-pity, or is this for real? Oh, my poor baby!None of this is worth getting; I'd sooner listen to N-Sync, for god's sake!"
4,very good remix CD,"This was a very good remix cd of NINs. i am a big fan of NIN and i have most of the cds, vhs, and dvds. buts this is probably one of my most listened to remix cds b/c of the Mr. Self Destruct remixs. the whole cd is great to listen to but those 3 songs make this cd worth its money. there are other very good songs one this cd. dont expect much from the eraser remixs though. they arent bad to listen to when you are talking online or driving and not really paying attention too them but they are hard to sit through with nothing else to do. all the other songs are good (piggy,downward spiral,hurt) hurt is also a very good ""remix."" you have to listen to it back to back with the really song to understand. there is one noise taken out of the song and it makes it sound alot better. but the best song on this cd is ""at the heart of it all"" by the aphex twin. great song. takes a while to get into it though."
5,Tortured Beyond,"Listen, believe. Can't feel the negativity. Listen again. Reznor took a lot of time on this one, and it was well worth the wait. This remix album from The Downward Spiral will have you going deeper into the depths of the mind that is Reznor."
4,Nine Inch Nails' friends join the spiral,"""Further Down the Spiral"" expertly reaches its goal, to continue the dark exploration of life and depression started in ""The Downward Spiral"". Many of the various remixers send us through a beat laden journey that continues to explore the original's passion and nihilistic mood. In the song ""Piggy(Nothing Can Stop Me Now)"" über-producer Rick Rubin teams up Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro to create a pulsating and oddly funky song. ""The Art of Self Destruction, Final"" pits Nine Inch Nail's own heavy guitar and over exposed electronics against Apex Twin slow, melodic musical excursion. The title of Coil's remix ""The Downward Spiral(The Bottom)"" summerizes itself and the entire album. It streches out the songs and attempts to translate the album's concepts in music, instead of vocals."
2,there's nothing like the real thing,"I recommend this album only to those starved NIN fans that need something different. I'd give this album 3 stars for those fans. Do not buy this record as a starting point.IMO none of these remixes improves on the original. Then again, how could I have expected a masterpiece such as ""The Downward Spiral"" be exceeded?"
4,"Ok, maybe we went too far down...","This is NIN's second ""follow up"" e.p., their first being Fixed. Well, I'll have to say this is, like Fixed, a great follow up.Piggy is a excellent mix to start out the cd, and could possibly be the best song on there. Nice acoustic/metal collerabration on this track.The Art of Self Desctruction parts 1 and 2 are next, and both are pretty good, and different.This disc also contains 3 versions of Eraser, the only good one being Denail;Realization. The other two are too boring and plain.We also get a not-so-different version of Hurt. The only thing different about this version is that it's a bit more clear then TDS version. We also have two songs by Aphex Twin on this, both of which are ok, yet kind of boring, relaxing if anything.So, I recomend the much better import version of this one."
1,Uh. . . Noise?,"Now, don't get me wrong here, I like Nine Inch Nails and Trent Reznor about as much as everyone else, but this remix album was hardly even recognizable. Downward Spiral was fantastic, but Further down the spiral just took some excellent songs and tweaked them out so much that they just became hard to listen too. I tried and tried with this one, but it just wouldn't grow on me."
1,Non-white noise,"There is at times, a fine line between noise and music. NIN not only crossed that line in this cd, but stomped on it a few times in the process. Not even close to the calibre of WITH TEETH, this cd is a waste of time and an insult to the talent that resides within this group of musicians.Songs that go from semi-music to irritating noise and last four times as long as one can abide, while ""playing"" the same thing over and over and ...well, you get my drift.If great music is your thing, pass this one up. Or write me a note and tell me why on earth such a great group would release such an abomination."
4,"a good companion to ""Downward""","This is a well-done remix album (up there with ""Fixed"") from NIN, it stands as some of Reznor & Co.'s best work. Whereas the import version is somewhat upbeat (mainly due to Charlie Clouser's remixes of 'Heresy' and 'Ruiner'), the American disc tends to expand on the bleaker aspects of ""The Downward Spiral"" (and very well, at that). It ultimately renders the album a bit of a bummer, which is no big deal. 'Piggy,' 'Eraser: Polite,' and 'Self Destruction, Final' are the standout tracks here. I think the biggest flaw is too many variations on 'Mr. Self Destruct' (3 total)--the final version seems to encompass all the aspects of the two versions that went before it, and retains a better essence of the original song."
2,Worked great at 1st,"I wanted to wait a few months befor I reviewed this product and its a good thing I did. It does install easy enough and looks and works great at first. Like the other reviewer posted you can hear it trying to work but the doors wont open. After the doors are opened it works fine, its like there isn't enough power to pop the latch. I leave my back seat down just in case but its a little embarassing climbing into my trunk to get into my car. I would recommend spending the money on a better kit."
4,Small Circle of Friends,"An interesting mix of Pop, R&B and hip-hop with an mellow electronic edge. Not bad! Not bad at all! Four stars (and the price was right)!!"
4,Pretty Good,"Alice seems to have gotten heavier in his old age instead of mellowing out like so many other artists. This album is heavy and brutal, Cooper and Manson seem to have the same ideas about the state of the world and society judging by the lyrics. AC while not as psycho as Manson is can sure rock as hard as he can, and this gem of an album is evidence. While I tend to like Manson better Cooper's albums still are really good, I know the older generation perfers Cooper and I(a member of the younger generation)can see why."
3,HEY ALICE!,"Brual Planet from Alice Cooper...what happened here? I dont believe that the Coop has ever been this political, and that IS a minus for ""Planet"". This CD lacks the very thing that drew me to Alice Cooper, years ago...Twisted Macbre Fun! Gone are the Nightmares, Trips to Hell, and Teenage Frankensteins, ...or at least the fun ones. Present are the Nightmares of living on a ""ball of hate"" in ""Brutal Planet"", trips to Hell involving starving populations, in ""Eat Some More"", and racist Teenage Frankensteins in ""Angry Young Man"". None of these songs are fun, only severly ""Nightly News"" depressing.The music is just West of mediocrity at its finest with no qualifying candidates for the ""last song heard"" hum. Hey Alice! You are still, without a doubt, my favorite performer. However, we all know, too well, the NIGHTMARES of real life! What about the nightmares of fantasy?"
1,Don't believe all the hype!,"Don't believe all the praise this album by Alice Cooper gets. It's nothing more, nothing less, than Alice following the trend, the trend being, in this case (unfortunately) the plague known as nu-metal. BRUTAL PLANET is all about nu-metal. There is almost no Alice here."
2,Cooper is boring.,"Tried to listen to Cooper a lot of times: bought School's Out, Welcome to My Nightmare and the recent DRAGONTOWN. All of them have only sparks of great rock music, but the general quality is so low and boring.. BRUTAL PLANET apresents the same history..."
4,Great Album,"Classic Alice Cooper, great metal cd, hard-hitting Alice with classic society commentary, live concert on Netflick even better, very enjoyable"
4,The heavy Alice,"I was quite suprised when I first played this cd. I mean yeah Alice has always been one of the original Metal Men, but this went past a lot of that. With Heavy distortion, fun lyrics, and a just a great progession of songs. Not his typical album I think but good non the less. Recomended for heavy metal fans and those already into Alice Cooper."
4,GET LOST MANSON! THE TRUE KING OF SHOCK ROCK'S BACK!,"Six years after Alice's last studio album come this crunching grinding monster of a cd. The first time I listened to it I thought ""God, I'd heard that he's such a nice guy, he seems pretty pissed off here"". It seemed to be lacking the grim humor that his fans love, but after reading an interview I understood totally. This is a great album and the heaviest thing Alice has done since 1988's RAISE YOUR FIST AND YELL. BRUTAL PLANET & WICKED YOUNG MAN set the scene, pounding out of your stereo speakers with a fierce, yet restrained, aggression. SANCTUARY is one of those great anthems which stays in your head for long after. Another highlight is the 21st Century's answer to ONLY WOMEN BLEED, TAKE IT LIKE A WOMAN. Sure, Manson's good, but does he have Cooper's staying power? Maybe, but I doubt Manson could retain his credibility if he wrote his own takes on YOU AND ME and HOW YOU GONNA SEE ME NOW. Cooper remains the King. Sorry, Elvis."
3,Why?,"It's not bad, but it sure sounds like Alice is trying to be Rob Zombie, Korn or Red Hot Chili Peppers. Why? All of these bands sound alike and now so does Alice. Alice is one of the best and doesn't need to copy anyone elses sound to sell CDs. Get Kane Roberts back. Not trying to offend anyone who likes this CD, this is just my opinion and it is not right or wrong."
4,Bleak Vision Of Our Society,"Alice's vision of our society is scary, yet unfortunately, pretty darned accurate. Violence, hatred, cruelty, madness - Alice is warning us this is where we're headed - and we don't want to go there. The album is a bit heavy for my tastes, but I do like about 7 of 11 songs. As a Christian, I was hoping for something along the lines of Last Temptation, and while this CD isn't as blatantly Christian, it is obvious to me that Alice is trying to warn us what walking away from God has caused to befall upon our society. Standout tracks, in my opinion: the first 4, Gimme, Take It Like A Woman, and Cold Machines. Enjoy!"
4,Gimme more,"A must for any Alice fan, highly recommened to all others. A new energy has been found on Alice's Brutal Planet. The theatrics have taken second stage with this production. Gimme & It's the little things make the CD worth the money by themselves the rest is all bonus. I would have gave it five stars but the chorus in Pessi-Mystic just doesn't fit the great beginning. 8 out of 11 is better than most."
5,Alice redeems himself with this one!,"I haven't really enjoyed a new Cooper album since ""Welcome to my Nightmare"". Sure, I kept up with a few that followed that, but there was to be nothing again that would equal the brilliance of the original Alice Cooper band. And lately, things in the Alice camp have become just plain BAD (""Hey Stoopid"", anyone! ). Then this thing comes roaring out of nowhere. Surely the hardest, heaviest music he's ever recorded, with Alice's snarling vocals fitting so well over the brutal metallic thrash. Sure, it's a bit derivative, but isn't everything these days? Plus, there's melody and darkness mixed in with the throttle, which serves to make this, as I said, the best Alice album in many, many years. THE KING IS BACK! LONG LIVE THE KING!"
3,Brutal Planet - after the fact,"The dust has settled a bit on this one and I can't help but feel that some of the initial excitement around this one has died down a good bit. ONLY because, the follow-up, ""Dragontown"", proved to be a more cohesive, lyrical and all around original effort. And who would have thunk? That the heavy metal thundering of ""Brutal Planet"" was merely a stepping stone. Go figure. But we all owe an allegiance to ""Brutal Planet"". It put Alice back in the make-up and in to the guillotine. And THAT, speaks for itself!"
5,This is good music,"In my opinion I can say this album is one of the best albums I've ever heard. Not a huge metal fan myself, when I heard brutal planet I was blown away."
5,blow me away,I bought this album cause i am a longtime fan of the man. When i first heard it i thought there was something wrong with my ears cause it didn't sound like anything alice has ever done. To be honest i was little impressed. But as i continued listening the album grew on me. There more i listend to it the more i realised this was a masterpice. The title-track is so raw and aggressive it blows your mind away. 'Pick up the bones' is probably the best song on the album. The lyrics are near poetry (very dark poetry) the references to columbine in several songs give the album an extra dimesnion. Buy it cause its the best album in years.
4,Beautiful ring!,This ring is every bit as lovely in reality as it appears in its photo. And the puzzle pieces work perfectly. Definitely worth the price!The ONLY downside is that the instructions they provide regarding how to actually do the puzzle are very confusing if you've never had or seen a puzzle ring before because there are no diagrams. I suggest searching for the solution online instead so you can put it back together after you take it apart... because you know you will. ;)
5,excellent,thank you so much for your prompt service. Package was received promptly and with no damages. I will continue to view your site for future purchase.
3,Fiskers,I have to make sure paper is placed correctly to get the correct cut .a little difficult to use .fine for what I need as in photographs and cards etc.
5,Good Belt,I bought this for use on 42 inch Woods belly mower for my 1967 Farmall Cub tractor. The belt fit great and was true to measurements. I have used it for about a year to mow four acres with no excessive loosening or wear.
2,A WASTE OF TIME!!!,"Although it is understandable that a single with only four tracks should not stand out, I believe that this one was a complete waste of time. ""Get Your Gunn"" and ""Misery Machine"" are good songs, but if you own the album then owning this single will not make your music-listening life any better. The other two tracks on the album are a remix by Trent Reznor, (which is the only thing keeping this CD above the 1 rating) and a stupid twelve minute long mish-mash of noises and weird voices, which I have listened to once. Compare this single with the single for ""Lunchbox"". ""Lunchbox"" had ""Down In The Park"" a cover version of the Gary Numen song, which is one of my favourite Manson songs. So to sum things up, I feel that this single extremely cons the fans, and I really wouldn't care if a car ran over it."
3,SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT,MARILYN MANSON WILL CERTAINLY NOT GO DOWN AS ONE OF MY PERSONAL FAVERITES WHEN IT COMES TO MUSIC BUT WHEN I HEARD THIS SINGLE THE OTHER DAY AND I LIKED IT. IT ID DIFFERENT FOR ME TO GET ACUSTOMED TO THIS STYLE OF MUSIC BUT IF I LISTEN TO IT OFTEN ENOUGH IT CAN CHANGE.
3,3.5 stars-- probably his best,"Because Trent Reznor helps more. This is much better than anything he's ever done. And POAF is probably his best album. If you're a fan of both NIN and Manson, then buy it. If not, leave it behind. And I dislike him for various reasons too."
5,A Dreambook,"Who knows why his methamorphosis started. Who knows why he turned into a beast. He seemed to be a completely normal, ordinary working man with a loving family. Maybe that normality was what induced the beautiful changes in him. A beast - but still beautiful: colourful, soft, dreaming, surreal, sensual - but still a beast.And when it's over, you'll know you read something just beautiful."
5,AMAZING !!,"For those of you already familiar with Albert Lee's playing you will notice that it just gets better and better. Take some well known songs, add a red hot band, top it off with some of the best guitar picking on this planet and you have Tear It Up. Some of Albert's licks are simply amazing, but many more are very subtle-the harder you listen the more you will discover. For those of you who are just discovering Albert Lee it won't take long to figure out why everyone else holds him in such high regard. No wonder Eric Clapton wanted him in his band."
3,Really Thorough,"I really like the thoroughness of this book and the enormous amount of tricks. Just one thing--there aren't enough illustrations that kept me up with the tricks. Instead, I am still a little confused about some of the more difficult card tricks."
2,Not worth it,"With most EPs, it's very hard to justify spending so much and getting so little, and that's especially true with this one. I'm a huge fan of the older Ned's stuff, but this EP is more like the newer Brainbloodvolume (BBV). The other sucky thing is that the first and last songs are the same, so you only get four songs. Summary: If you like GodFodder then don't buy this EP, but if you like BBV and you have money to blow then go ahead."
4,Ned's lives!,"Corrode lacks some of the Ned's guitar and drum power, but Jonn's lyrics and voice bring back a Happy time. Like Morrissey after The Smiths era, you'll love it, but be left wanting a little bit more."
5,Better than my other Chimney Starter,"I bought this after seeing it in a store. It's a much better design than the regular chimney starters I usually see.-It's much larger, so I can get a good amount of lump charcoal in and not have to immediately start a second batch like I had to with my old smaller starter.-The inside bottom is a ring of wires instead of a sheet of metal with a few holes in it. This made for MUCH better ignition from the newspaper underneath as all of the flame was going up against the coal, instead of some through the holes and the rest out of the vents like my old starter.-The extra helping handle is a nice touch, though I don't really use it.-The holes on the side make it much easier to tell how far the ignited coals are so you know when you're ready to dump it on the grill.Another great Weber product!"
2,bad imitation,This product was not what it was represented to be. I have owned the actual flavor wave oven & I have owned this imitation. I found the quality to be inferior in this one & parts of lesser quality were used to justify its less expensive price tag. Most notable was a plastic cover to supplement a skimpy glass bottom---which is a complete glass bowl in the actual flavor wave to cook in. The plastic is not durable doesn't last long.
3,Not a chicken,"This product worked okay for me. The ads should not make such a big deal about cooking frozen food because that was my worst experience with the oven. Does a good job on most thawed foods. Cooks quickly, browns nicely. I would not recommend buying it to cook a frozen chicken if you have a bad temper. You will need to break something to vent your disappointment."
2,Not impressed,This product is sitting in a cabinet taking up space. I just was not that impressed with it.
3,WORKS WELL BUT...,"This is my second convection oven of this design. The other one, which I purchased years ago, the motor gave out, so I disposed of it.The Flavorwave Deluxe works fairly well, but doesn't do everything that the company says.My first gripe is, if you try to cook frozen food, like the infomercial says, it takes much much longer to cook, while they give you the impression that you can go from the freezer to the oven, that's true, but the cooking time increases greatly.My second complaint, they tell you that it's not necessary for you to flip what your cooking, not true, you do need to flip, otherwise the bottom won't be properly cooked.And last but not least, because there is not much heat circulating on the bottom, you can't cook frozen pizza in this oven, the bottom crust will not get brown and crispy, but will be soggy and raw.If you flip your food, and allow extra time for food to cook, because their cooking times are not accurate, then this is a fairly good product."
2,flavor wave oven deluxe,"I bought flavor wave oven deluxe about 2-3 years ago, I use it less than once a month. It works perfectly. now that the heat element does not work. I do not know where to have it fixed nor how much will it cost to be fixed. If this is the end of my oven , $ 150 that I paid for, compared to about 30 times of use, is a total loss. I cannot say yes or no since other might work but not mine."
1,Flavor Wave Oven Delux Reflux,"A couple years ago I orered a Flavor Wave Oven Delux. It arrived the day before I moved. I lost the instrections! I called, wrote, and worried. I was passed from one phone number to another and allI could find out that no one made it anymore. It sits on my shelf. I tried to push buttons blindly but ... No one seems to know who has the instructions. Everything is out of print.Jerry-"
2,flavorwave oven deluxe,"cooks chicken nicely, i used it quite a bit at first, but then gradually the new wore off. it has been retired to the cabinet for it's term until i get tired of looking at it there; will eventuallybe given to the charity of my choice."
1,FlavorWave Oven Deluxe,"The first oven I received did not work at all. The replacement I received worked for a few days then died. I then asked for a refund which I only received going through Amazon, THANKS!."
5,Flavorwave oven really works,"I bought my Flavorwave oven about 4 years ago and I would never want to be without it. In fact I purchased another one as a back up. It cooks quickly and the chicken and meat come out tender and juicy. The proof is in the taste. Better than larger grills that you have to use outside in the hot weather, and it fits into the dishwasher."
1,Thane does not honor their warranty,I bought my oven a week ago. I've used it twice on frozen foods and both times it took more than twice as long to cook as their chart showed. I called Thane and they said the heating unit was defective and I would have to pay $39.99 plus shipping because I did not buy the unit directly from them (I bought it direct from Get Organized and probably would have bought it here except they had it on sale for $79.99). Buyer beware - the manufacturer does not honor their 1 year warranty!
1,$1.99 is way too much!,"I'm not a Hillary fan, or a Clinton fan in general. From the description i expected something with some meat in it. This was just an empty burger bun. There is nothing substantive here. What is described as the terrible injustices here are something that hundreds if not thousands of other politicians have done and will continue to do, despite the laws that were written to prohibit it. If this were so awful, why wouldn't the Bush administration, FBI, DOJ have started an investigation with an ""independent"" Ken Starr type? Monicagate, Whitewater etc are more ""scandalous. If you used the rules/laws indicated in this piece, all of Congress, K Street and every state in the nation would be backlogged with court cases. Sorry."
4,OMG she is so pathetic!,Not sure if this is a documentary or a horror flick. We dodged a bullet this election year. I'd move to Canada if she was President.
1,Pathetic Neo-Con Pap,"Considering all the lies the present administration has mired itself and the country in... Anything the Clintons or pretty much any other politician have done pales in comparison to over 4,000 dead young men and women in a war started on a lie and continuing on that same lie. This is so yesterday. This guy needs to quit and get a life. Horrible job putting this together, my dog could do better editing. The media banned it because it was cr@p. Nothing new here. Don't waste your money or your time."
2,Highly Partisan,"From the first moment this documentary starts, they try to tell you that it is supposed to be non-partisan. How can one man's story not be partisan?It does provide some interesting facts that suggests that Hillary may have violated campaign financing law. I just couldn't follow the entire trail due to either bad editing, or the director just wanted to make it as hard to follow as possible.Would I recommend this to my friends and family? Probably not, Hillary, and Bill are doing enough to destroy her campaign. I don't think this hard to follow documentary has much impact on that. Also by trying to pass this off as non-partisan, when you can clearly tell it's a partisan vendetta documentary makes all the claims suspect in my opinion."
2,'My Flame' flickers (2.5 stars),"This is one of Costello's more unique recordings. Perhaps it will grow on me with repeated listenings as has happened recently with 'All This Useless Beauty'. That said, 'My Flame Burns Blue' has proved a challenging listen early on.Some of my problem with 'Flame' is simply song preference. There are several selections that are among my least favorite Costello songs: 'Clubland', 'Almost Blue' and '...Forbidden Playthings' among them. YECCHH!The good stuff.....The energized version of 'That's How You Got Killed Before' is a revelation, but nothing else quite approaches that level. 'God Give Me Strength' is pretty faithful to the studio version on 'Painted From Memory' and is sturdy if not spectacular. 'Favourite Hour', 'Almost Ideal Eyes' and 'Episode of Blonde' come off solidly. The version of 'Watching the Detectives' here will likely either amuse or repulse.Declan is nothing if not experimental. He's certainly that on 'Flame'."
5,This man does it all,"Elvis as a crooner? Oh yes. He pulls it off. I saw the tour for this release at the Fabulous Fox Theatre in Atlanta. It only supported my faith in this album. I am up for anything different and when I heard of this I couldn't resist. It holds up.""HORA DECUBITIS"" & ""GOD GIVE ME STRENGTH"" are the openers and closers for this disc. They are the 2 standouts on the disc and let me tell you, all else in between makes the perfect sandwich. You chew, disolve and are left with a pleasant taste in your mouth.When I saw Costello perform in Atlanta, I was blown away by his voice. He came out for an encore and didn't even use a mic. He gave an incredible performance, and he did the same for this CD performance at NORTH SEA JAZZ FESTIVAL.All in all, if you are a fan, or a newcomer, this man does not dissapoint on this. Costello is all over the place in the musical circles, but he remains stedfast on this release. He delivers!"
1,This is painful!,"Go and buy some Bobby Darin, Tony Bennet or in fact anyone who can sing. If I had composed some of the great music on this Cd I wouldn't have given Costello the permission to murder the songs in the way he does."
4,"Excellent disk, but beware, it is a compilation","The music on this disk is astonishing and heart-rending. But Camaron fans should know that the disk is consists of selected tracks from Camaron's early disks with Paco de Lucia. So if you are really interested in getting to know this artist, consider beginning with his first LP, known as ""Al verte las flores lloran."" That way you can avoid duplications. But if all you want is one disk of Camaron, it would be hard to go wrong with this one."
1,"very short, no depth to it","This article, printed, is maybe 1 page long. It says a few basic things. Not very in depth, no unique insights.I wouldn't pay 5.95 for it again!"
3,"Better than Barron's, Not as good as Princeton Review","The title of this review sums it up. Petersen's APWH study guide is just ""OK"" for AP World History. It's a good source for ideas for multiple choice questions. I've used Petersen's, Barron's and Princeton Review with my students--hands down winner is PR's ""Cracking the APWH Exam"", In My Humble Opinion."
3,Fantasty,The story-line was somewhat cute but clearly implosable in todays political society where political views help define belief systems that people hold dear. It it one's world-view that are a meaningful part of what attracts one to another person. This movie was clearly a comedy based upon illogical constructs.
3,Replacement Timer,This was a replacement pool timer. I ordered this one because my old timer had a grounding wire post&screw. This newer one does not have a similar grounding post but a green screw to ground wires. The other timer brands at Home Depot and Lowes are similar. I only replaced the timer mechanism to avoid the work of regrounding the wires to the green screw. If you want to replace the whole timer box check other brands as the prices were similar. I you want to replace the timer mechanism only from a similar box this will work fine.
2,Burned up,"Bought this item for a 65 gal electric hot water heater 220v after six months I detected a burning smell in my garage,it was the timer"
4,Usually Used To Control Swimming Pool Pumps,"This timer is usually used to control 230V swimming pool filter pumps. It operates a single on/off cycle during a 24-hour period, which is adjustable. Purchasing an additional time tripper set will add another on/off cycle. The timer motor requires between 208 and 277 volts for operation and switches both poles (hot wires). My original timer finally expired after more than 30 years of use, so I bought this replacement from Amazon, which was less expensive than buying one from my local electrical distributor.Fortunately, this new mechanism fits and snaps right into the old Intermatic housing. For those who just need to replace the functional parts, this greatly simplifies the installation. Amazon's price for the entire timer assembly including the metal housing was less than others charge for just the mechanism itsef.It was shipped promptly, arrived undamaged and at a good price."
5,Thumbs up,A great item. It was very easy to install and it works perfectly as pool timer. Fairly priced. Thank you.
4,A great read. Keeps you guessing until the end.,"Frances distinguishes herself because she not only tells you what the character is saying, but what they are thinking, and how they look, as they say it. She is a very good storyteller. As in her book Dark Devotion, while you may think you know ""who did it,"" you really do not know the whole story until the last page."
2,Tedious,"This writer's style includes domestic minutiae, which is really not character driven. It is dull, and fills paragraph after paragraph. Her heroine is not likeable, but of course she is lovely, or so everyone says. The ending was no surprise, but I was glad when it did end."
5,Excelent book for beginner woodcarvers,One of my favorite woodcarving books. Nice patterns and easy-to-follow instructions. Great techiques for finishing.
1,Not an 1100-watt toaster!,"I bought this toaster specifically because I wanted an 1100-watt toaster, as advertised on this page. But when I received the toaster, I discovered that the specifications on the bottom of the toaster indicated that it was a 900-watt toaster. This information is available (I discovered later) on the Krups website as well.It did seem to do a reasonable job of toasting, but no better than other toasters I have purchased for less money. I was willing to spend the extra money only because I thought I'd get a higher wattage, and thus more efficient, toaster. Back it went."
5,Truly an unauthorised biography befitting a legendary band!,"A band that do not play by the rules and beat everyone at their own game! Featuring interviews by contemporaries and excerpts from most of the band members themselves ('voxpops' from a Tool special aired on Australian satellite TV Music channel Channel V)- even legendary producer David Bottrill talks about his involvement. Early days are discussed by those who were there. Remember Green Jelly? 1st performance on a TV show featuring Maynard & Danny! I was NOT expecting the rare footage of early 80s King Crimson.My only complaint is that the original bassist's departure is described as a ""dismissal""; in true Tool style, they remained enigmatically tight lipped when asked if Paul D'Amour 'had jumped or been pushed' - it was merely a case of artistic differences, where the parting was amicable.If you are curious as to what the members were up to beforehand and how they came together, this is the DVD for you!"
3,Very short strike.,Nice tool but made to be too short to provide consistent edge. These scissors must be twice as long to be comfortable for post card or picture edging.
5,Must have for labor studies,I first purchased this book two years ago. I have used it in every labor studies class that I have taken and I wouldn't dream of not using it. The definitions are precise and clear. I feel so strongly about this book that I recently purchased another copy for my Local Union President. This book is a must have.
4,Nice gift for little artists,This was a birthday gift for a jungle theme party. The stencils are a great idea for budding artists to make animal chalk art easily. They come in a handy carrying bag. Shipping was also excellent and gift-wrapped.
1,Doesn't work,I was very disappointed with this product. There is so little tackiness on the two side of this product that it just doesn't stick to the bottom of the rug.
1,Absolutely useless,"Tried them under runners to protect my carpet. Did not grips the top rugs at all, they moved all over the place. They were a complete waste of money. Ended up taking them up. Could only return for partial refund as I'd used them for over a month to give them a try. Don't do the job at all."
3,Better than nothing!,"Does not completely hold rug in place, rug still moves, needs to be adjusted everyday! It's still better then nothing!"
5,Helpful resource for foster children and foster parents,"This book explains in an organized, easy to understand way, the various aspects of foster care. This book is a valuable resource for foster children and adults who work with them, including foster parents. -Cynthia Miller Lovell, author of The Star: A story to help young children understand foster care, and Questions & Activities for The Star: A handbook for foster parents"
2,"Very Informative, for a 10 year old","Very Informative, for a 10 year old. I got alot for a project I had to do though."
4,Guinness Poster,The poster arrived on time and in good shape. The price was good and although it is kind of distorted from being blown up it still looks good.
3,guiness toucan,The poster arrived very quickly and in excellent shape.The only thing that is less than fabulous is that the border around the poster is actually bright blue and not brown like it is in the picture. The poster seems to have been blow up so large that it is a wee bit on the blurry side.
2,Remember My Cousin Vinny?,"Remember when Vinny had the witness on the stand, he asked if he used instant grits? ""No self respecting Southerner eats those"" was the reply. Its true. These taste OK, but just go for the Old Fashioned Grits, they only take 20 minutes or so to make, and are way better. Its tradition."
3,Not a starting point..,"I'm not the biggest Camel buff out there, but I've heard alot of good stuff come from these guys (Moonmadness, Raindances...) ..and what makes them good is the way all the instruments usually contribute to the song structure. Whether it be the keyboards or the drums locking you into a 5/4 time signature, or guitar solos that suck...you into the song, these keys know how to do it.But Harbour takes a different approach--not a horrible approach--but different. The short instrumental pieces seem to be avenues for the guitarist alone, over synths that generally just float into the next track. And the vocals are more of a presence... not in a totally disagreeable way, but then Camel, like most bands, is better when they just shut up and play..This isn't a bad album, but should definitely not be your first experience with Camel."
5,Probably the pinnacle of the entire Camel catalogue,"I have been trying to locate a reasonably priced copy of this CD.....Everything available is overpriced......Once an item is out of print and supplies become scarce......The scalping vultures come out of the closet, readily producing copies at extraordinary markups....Does anybody have information regarding a future release date for this selection???"
4,"Good stuff, no solutions manual","Currently using this book for a graduate class in organic chemistry, and I've got to say, it's very good. It's a little dense, but I plan to use it for reference after this class anyway. There is, unfortunately, no solutions manual available for student purchase, but the professor was kind enough to get the solutions manual and copy it for everyone (this is why I gave this book 4 instead of 5 stars). A very nice little addition in this revision: computational chemistry has been integrated into the text, and DFT, MD, etc. calculations are not explained, but mentioned with suggested uses."
4,A very good book for graduate organic classes.,"I used this text in my graduate organic course and I thought that this book helped me alot. The chapters were a little long, but the problems were very thought provoking. I highly recommend this text for advanced organic courses at the graduate level of study."
3,Undergraduate text,"This text is good for an advanced undergraduate course. It is a pretty good reference, with two major problems:1) The book is a flimsy paperback. Other paperbacks I have can withstand usage just fine, but after 1 month the text was in two pieces. It feel apart at the binding. I never even brought it to class, it sat on the bookshelf and fell apart after twice a week readings.2) The solutions are presented as references to journal articles. I am not too shy of searching for articles, but when you are in a crunch it would be nice to not have to search through 10 pages of tangential information to find the one data or conclusion you need in order to verify the accuracy of your work.Besides for that, it worked just fine for my advanced undergrad course in physical organic chemistry. I did have to make frequent references to other sources for more in-depth information, but when study time came it worked better than the myriad organic texts available at my library."
3,Advanced Organic Chemistry,"The bookAdvanced Organic Chemistry, Part A: Structure and Mechanismsis pretty good for the price but copy I bought obviously contains some highlightings contrary to the content of the advert that it contained no highlightings. The delivery is time is excellent and the handling superb!I will continue to buy from Amazon!"
2,save your money for Physical Organic Chemistry - by Dougherty & Anslyn,"This book is written at the undergraduate level. The figures are a joke. It's a paperback and will fall apart. If you are in graduate school; buy the text by Anslyn & Dougherty instead. It is a nice hard bound book, durable & weighs a ton. Its worth the money and the weight in your backpack."
3,Great remixes....all ONE of them,"""Lunchbox"" is a classic Manson song. No one can deny that. The first remix is phenomenal as well. ""Down In The Park"" however left me feeling very unfulfilled. When I took out the CD I didn't even remember a single beat, guitar riff, or catchy anything. It left no lasting impressions. The reason this CD gets 2 stars taken away is because the 3 remixes sound way too much alike. The first remix [as I mentioned before] is the best and the others sound too similar to gain my respect. I would only buy this CD if you find it at a good price."
4,Lunchbox Party!,"I can easily why Lunchbox became a single from Portrait of an American Family. It was, and will always be a fun song. Any Manson fan who doesn't find this song occasionally popping up in his or her head, aught to be ashamed of themselves. It's about rebellion, violence and growing up and being a big rock n' roll Star. With this big single we are given the Original Lunchbox, the B-side Down in the Park, 3 Remix's and an Edit. The original is great in itself. Down in the Park is a very cool cover of the weird Gary Numan song. The 3 remix's are all pretty good, but I would say that the best remix is the Next Motherf***er remix. And I can only see the edit used by High school or college DJ's. I'm one of them so it's ok with me. Normally I am annoyed by Edits but this one somehow doesn't tap that little button in by head that says BURN AND DESTROY. Hope this helped. Bye."
5,This Single is great,"Let's face it. ""Lunchbox"" and ""Down in the Park"" are probably the bet Manson songs there is and them being on the same disc? This is worth it. There are 4 remixes of Lunchbox, the oringinal and the xtra song Down in the Park, which is only on this disc, i think. Go buy it."
3,Nothing but Lunchbox,This is a good Singel...Brown Bag and Metal are olmost the same song....Down in the Park whas realy good song i lakdet beter then Lunchbox
2,Doesn't Fit,"Husky 51121 black front floormats represented as ""custom fit"". Product received clearly not custom and has numeroius ""cut lines"" that may conform to other vehicles. No configuration close to '08 Dakota pickup truck.Husky Liners 51121 Heavy Duty Black Rubber Front Floor Mat - Pack of 2"
4,"good, but nothing incredible","This single was worth the money, and you should pick it up. I've heard Reptile and March of the Pigs many times, and the remixes,although good, aren't much different than the original songs. Yet, the single isn't boring, since you don't hear five march of the pigs in a row (although the closer single is INCREDIBLE). If you are a NIN fan, you should get this single, although it isn't the best NIN out there. Besides, all the pigs, all lined up sounds better on Halo 12 (Closure) live."
4,A high powered single that is intensifying to listen to.,"March of the pigs is great. I love it because it is one of those tracks that inspire an flame in the listener's mind. I used to rock out to March of the Pigs when I was several years younger. I listened then,as a teen, and still appreciate this noise. I had the single ""closer"". On it was March of th Pigs- (a live version) I used to listen to it on long trips and it would make me feel very energetic. I would be fully pumped, and mentally cleansed when I dug the earphones out of my skull. Crank it."
5,One of the better halos,"NIN has put out a bunch of singles, most of which are out of print now, and this is one of the few that isn't, thank goodness. By far my favorite single of theirs (the perfect drug album coming in at a close second). he remixes here are just so surreal and noisy with sonic texture that can't even be described. very skinny-puppyish for lack of a better word. But buy this single up! Buy it in bulk while you still can!"
3,"good song, not enough done","I really like March of the pigs and felt disappointed that this CD single has so little done with it. Check out the inferior song Closer, where there are so many other versions on that CD Single."
3,One of the Better singles released from the NIN,"This, the first single, actually preceeding The Downward Spiral, is a nice little introduction to what The Downward Spiral would later come to sound like. Contents:1. March of the Pigs - March of the Pigs. Y'know, booty beats and marching pigs. 4/52. Reptilian - An interesting remix of one of the best songs on The Downward Spiral. This one's got all kinds of crazy bleeps and bloops and weird computer malfunctioning sounds. The best Reptile remix. 4/53. All the Pigs, All Lined Up - Basically just a stripped down version of March of the Pigs made to sound like a live performance I suppose. It's okay ..I guess. 2/54. A Violet Fluid - A great instrumental piece which is almost dance-y, quite strange. I like it. 3/55. Underneath the Skin - Another remix of Reptile. I actually prefer the first remix of it on this EP, but whatever floats your boat. 3/5A nice collectors item, but I wouldn't recommend it to new listeners."
3,A nice read,"Late Bloomer by Melissa Pritchard is the sassy story of Prudence True Parker. Prudence's life is suffering from a lack of money, men and memories (she doesn't have a life), until she meets drag queen Digby Deeds (alias Mildren Crowley), author of the successful Savage Passion romance series, at a book signing.Digby is dying, and with little forethought, leaves Prudence forty romance plots to write. Life soon imitates art as Prudence pens her first Indian romance. She becomes ""involved"" with Ray Chasing Hawk, a Native American activist, artist and model and discovers that real life is more complicated but better than any romance novel.Pritchard deftly blends beautiful prose with hilarious situations. I laughed a lot and somehow, by the end of the book, didn't mind growing older so very much. I had a bit of trouble getting started and the situations sometimes seemed a bit over the top but I kept turning the pages and was happy thatI did."
4,Marilyn Manson: REMIX & REPENT (1997),"In 1997, Marilyn Manson released his fourth album entitled, REMIX AND REPENT. This album is a remix album, with two remixes, two live recordings, and an acoustic demo. A great album, but not one to match up with Manson's first three albums, or his albums to come.THE HORRIBLE PEOPLEThis track is actually a remix of ""The Beautiful People"", and it's one hell of a remix. Love it.TOURNIQUET (Prosthetic Dance Mix)Original version from the album ANTICHRIST SUPERSTAR (1996). Great remix.DRIED UP, TIED AND DEAD TO THE WORLD (Live in Utica NY)Original version from the album ANTICHRIST SUPERSTAR (1996). Great live performance.ANTICHRIST SUPERSTAR (Live in Hartford, CT)Original version from the album ANTICHRIST SUPERSTAR (1996). Great live performance.MAN THAT YOU FEAR (Acoustic Requiem for ANTICHRIST SUPERSTAR)Previously unreleased. Great acoustic version.This album was pretty impressive, but there just aren't enough tracks on here to do Manson and the band any justice."
5,i give remix and repent 2 thombs up,"This CD is the bomb, it combines great remixes with awesome live tracks and a great version of man that you fear. i recommend it to any manson fan. and its only a few dollars so its a great bargain. take my advice and buy this cd right away. END"
5,hell yeah!!,"very awesome disc! the acoustic 'man that you fear' will make you cry, and the live 'antichrist superstar' will make you scream. hell yeah!! this is a kick-arse cd."
3,Review and Repent.,"An EP released to fulfill fan demands for live material. The CD not only features live blistering renditions tracks from the mammoth known as Antichrist Superstar, it also includes remix tracks, notebly a favourite activity among the Manson crew.See U in the Future..."
4,Very Enjoyable,"This was a pleasant read. I like Christine Bennett and her husband. I liked Sandy Gordon, the man who wanted to know what happened when his wife, Natalie, disappeared at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade a year ago.My biggest complaint was with the title. In the beginning of the book, it's not supposed to be clear whether Sandy Gordon's wife ran away, was kidnapped, or was killed. However, the title The Thanksgiving Day Murder, made me aware that Natalie was dead.Overall this is a good story that's easy to read."
4,dog eats it,"dont know it its doing any good ,but he eats it , he has had senitive itch skin for about a year .hope it will help time will tell"
2,iPod Case,"When I first recieved this case, it looked nice and worked very well for me. Over time, however, I beegan to realize the clear plastic that covered the screen was scratching it up. It is a great case with all of its great features dwarfed by a simple flaw that could lower the viewing expierience and value of your iPod."
5,Great introductory book for serious students,"Pandita is an authority on this practice, and this book contains many aspects of his teaching which are generally not accessible to practitioners unless one personally attends practice in his ashram.This book introduces mindfulness meditation as taught by Buddha and takes a no non-sense approach to give a head start towards awakening.This is a serious book, and as any serious book on this serious subject, it is not a story book. Pandita goes slowly in to details, and makes sure that reality is unveiled systematically. Of course, if the student is weak in determination, the book would not help. However, for serious students, this is an invaluable book.I wish Pandita's all teachings some day become available to Western readers in other books.If you are a beginning meditator truly serious about awakening, read this book. It will really change the way you practice."
3,It was good.,"This was a good book that I would recommend to anyone. It wasn't the best book in the world, but it was interesting. It wasn't boring at all. It is very realistic."
3,Good plot but thin character description,"The plot of this book is very exciting, and it is a real page-turner - hard to put down. However, I feel that you never get under the skin of the characters and really understand them or care for them. I feel the book is a okay read, but not among the best that this author has written. I feel that it could have been so much better if the characters and the reasons for their decisions and actions and change of minds were better explained and made more believable. However, if you like the WW2 genre, I think it is worth a read."
4,Very Nice,"Very nicely done by Allen Toussaint. He pays great respect to the songs, but adds enough of his own style to make it all come together. Very pleasant to relax to.."
3,It works but need improvement,It works but always seems to let coffee grounds past. I wish it has rubber on the edges because either way I try it I cant get it to stop letting ground past. I hope they improve it some but I like the idea. I will still carry it along as it weight is nothing and it does work.
3,Does notinclude lid,"I looked all over for a spare lid for my jetboil cup but have been unable to locate one. When I purchased this coffee press it surprisingly noted that it included a lid. When I received it however there was no lid, and the packaging did not describe an included lid. Customer service offered to exchange the coffee press, but when I questioned if a lid was even available anywhere the response changed to an offer of a partial refund so I could find the lid elsewhere...What... I just wanted a lid, plus the coffee press is pretty much useless without a lid. So now I am returning it for a refund. I hope the description will be updated soon. 3 stars for prompt service, but the rep would have messed up the response by exchanging the first coffee press for another also without a lid if I had not pressured her to verify its availability.The jetboil stove is a 5 star product though, I just wish they made spare lids available"
5,Nice way to avoid instant coffee or 'Cowboy Coffee',"This fits nicely inside the PCS, only weighs ounces. I used to make 'Cowboy Coffee' while on the trial (dump coffee grounds in boiling water, then add cold water to stop the boil, all the grounds sink to bottom and you can drink the coffee) but I got sick of the coffee not being hot enough and the coffee grounds that didn't want to stay at the bottom.This works perfect for me, so much so that I take it to work on days when I'm out of the office and away from a convenience store. I actually use this to make coffee off the back of my work truck.It works excellent, as long as you follow the simple instructions on the package. Most importantly, do not try to force it quickly, just a slow pressure and it will make a great coffee.I have not had problems with this item bouncing or getting damaged in any way, although I usually fill any gaps inside the PCS with napkins or small ziplock bags of coffee so there is no room for anything to wiggle anyway."
5,Slick little tool makes hiking better,Simple little accessory that weighs virtually nothing. It looks a little flimsy but I've had 0 problems on the trail and would recommend this to anyone with a JB stove. I've always meant to get a coffee press for home use but I use the JP cup/plunger on my kitchen counter as much as I do outdoors.
3,Whats with the coat?,"This is a very predictable Steven Segal movie. The only thing that makes it better than his recent flops is the action scenes are a little more believable .In this one he is a ""swordmaster"". There is some swordplay and a few arms cut off etc. Same old story though, bad guys on scene looking to take over the world, bad guys kill friend or family member, Seagal seeks revenge. Seagal looks slower and fatter then ever.In one scene his buddy climbs over a wall, you then wait for Seagal to follow over the wall but his buddy opens the gate for him. Good thing because Seagal would never make it over himself. Also, He never takes his long black coat off through the whole movie. In the jungle scenes it looks like everybody just got out of the shower, clean pressed clothes , clean jungle fortress, they must have a good dry cleaner in that jungle ,and maid service"
3,Are These Your Chopsticks?,"Steven Seagal plays an ex-CIA agent Travis Hunter in the 2005 direct-to-DVD Into the Sun. Hunter is brought in to look into the murder of Tokyo's governor along with his new FBI partner Sean Mac (played by Vampire Diaries' Matthew Davis). The murder is linked to the Japanese mafia known as Yakuza. Hunter was raised in Japan and knows the customs, but his new partner doesn't know about the culture and is more of a distraction. Hunter ends up sending Mac on a surveillance mission, but it ends up in disaster. As Hunter gets closer to the killers, Yakuza kills someone close to him, resulting in Hunter taking matters into his own hands.Despite from the incorrect CIA/FBI jargon, Into the Sun wasn't a bad action flick. Yes, the whole drug kingpin plot has been done to death, but there are some decent sword fighting scenes that kept the movie likeable."
1,the bad guys get iced,"Well I like to see a one-man army lay waste a wall-to-wall cast of hoodlums and devastate Japanese restaurant sets (tongs, yakuza, mafia, and terroristas are all good kendo fodder), but this film just gathers together every action flick cliche there ever was and manages to dumb it down from there - the dialog is dire, the humor pancake flat, and there is not enough action to justify getting out of bed for and it is as badly shot as any kung fu hustle I ever saw. get real"
5,BETTER THAN KILL BILL -SEAGALS BEST,THIS IS DEFINITLY SEAGALS BEST MOVIE.WONDERFUL FILMED;PRETTY SWORD AND ACTION SCENES;BLOODY SHOOTOUTS AND A GOOD STORYLINEAND LAST BUT NOT LEAST THE CREDIT SONG SUNG BY HIMSELF:THIS IS NOT A CHECK IT OUT MOVIE - THIS IS A MUST HAVE!!!!!!I WATCHED IT MORE THAN 30 TIMES and the movie get better and better!
5,great,really great i liked the movie the concept actors everything was reall great me an the grandkids had a good time watching the movie thanks
4,Bill W on Bill W,"This is the story of AA co-founder Bill Wilson's first forty years of life set forth in his own words recorded at the Hotel Bedford during September, 1954. He is assisted by Ed Bierstadt. The book is a wonderful compilation of anecdotes told in Bill's own words in an effort to shed light upon how his experiences led to his personality development which contributed to his fall into alcoholism. It is refreshing and free of controversial arguments found in some of the more recent biographies. The description of his spiritual experience once again by the man himself is very uplifting. The afterword and appendices nicely flesh out this historical account of this truly special man to whom so many owe their lives."
3,"Good, but not her best","From time to time I do like a good, easy read from Danielle Steel. This book was not as good as some of her others but I was not disappointed. My main complaint is how the author continually repeated information over to the reader - especially since what is repeated ends up giving away what is to come. For example, India, the main character, repeats how much her husband loves her and what a good marriage they have. When things do fall apart it was obvious that it was going to happen because we were told over and over again how great things were. You knew from the inside cover that this was going to happen, but it would have been nice to have some twists or leave you guessing a bit more. I would recommend this book to another D.S. fan, but not someone ""new"" to her as it is not her best."
4,OK,This book was good once you get past the first chapter. The longer you read the book the better it gets.
4,"Another great book by Daniel Steele, it ended to soon.","I would love to have a Bittersweet Part II. Interest reading, good perspective for someone in the midst of a divorce - you can live through it and be better off in the end."
4,Interesting but very good,I just finished reading Bittersweet. It is a typical love story by Steel but none the less very interesting. I was curious about just what would happen to India. It is too bad that she wasn't on her own before she met Paul. She didn't have a chance to be by herself and therefore grow and know herself before she was thrown into another relationship. I did like the way that Steel took the time and let the new relationship( Paul&India)grow into love. I gave India time to get over Doug. All in all the book was different and interesting and I had trouble putting it down.
1,Bittersweet should have been a short story!,"To my great disappointment, this one just didn't cut it for me. Steel stretched this premise way too far without enough action to keep it interesting. She kept going over and over the same ""un-fulfilled, mis-understood, unloved"" theme until I almost went nuts. When was India going to snap out of it,see her husband for the louse he was and get on with her life? Not for at least 150 pages! Her long-suffering type of martyr personality (even with her new love)left me unsympathetic. It took real effort to finish the story, and when I did it was disappointing. A quickie, manufactured wrap up to a story too long in the telling and not nearly enough emotion to draw me in the way Steel usually does!"
1,Wait for the paperback---not her best!!!,"Two of us in the office rushed to buy this new book.....and came to the same conclusion....we think she wrote this one in her sleep! One of her worst efforts, cardboard characters, really slow, utterly predictable throughout, and she tends to repeat herself quite a bit, especially regarding how the characters feel...enough already, we get it! I usually really enjoy her books, she is a great storyteller.....this is just not a good example of her work."
3,Not as good as her past books.,"I usually love Danielle Steel's novels but this one is subpar. Her writing style is slow and I had a hard time getting into the book. I thought the character of India was okay but Steel does not go into India's past history (except for her father). I found India unsypathetic. How could she stay in a marriage like that? And the character of Doug, he was very one-dimentional. Why was he like this? There was no sympathy for his character. He was a husband who just didn't care. I don't think Steel developed any one these characters to the best of her ability. I'll keep reading but this wasn't one of my favorites."
1,Wimpy main character was irritating...,"India, the main character, has been a homemaker for 17 years. Now she wants more, a chance to have a career and a family too. Unfortunately it takes 3/4 of the book to get to the point where the character decides she has the right to make a decision for her own happiness. The realization that she could choose herself first, was painfully slow. The new man in her life was also less than enthralling. Older, reeling from his recent loss, he mistakenly pushes her away. By the time they come together again, who cares?"
1,Predictable!,"I used to love Danielle Steel. Either I've outgrown her or she's run out of ideas, I'm not sure which. I was very disappointed in this book. Very boring - I skimmed through the last chapter just to get it over with."
2,C'mon...where are the real people here?,"...I can't help but think this book isn't typical of her fare; how else could she have become so popular? I was astounded that India's husband, Doug, is painted with such a wicked brush. There is no way he could have been so insensitive all those years and she's only just starting to realize it? For a charcter who's supposed to have such insight with her camera, she's certainly blind without the lens in front of her face. I found myself getting annoyed the poor guy got this type of treatment from his creator and waited for the moment when the guy would display any sort of humanity.Having said that, I'll confess I did appreciate Steel's imagery. The sailboat is a bit over the top...but hey, it's a fantasy, right?In conclusion, I guess you could say one thing about this book: black and white (characters) and read all over (by her legions of fans)..."
2,Self-indulgent and poorly written,"I haven't read Danielle Steel in years, and though she's advanced beyond 20-something lovers facing Perils of Pauline strife, Bittersweet definitely left a bitter taste in my mouth. Anyone who reads or watches popular media will be familiar w/her recent romance/marriage/pending divorce from a wealthy yachtsman and will have People Magazine and Entertainment Tonight snippets in their head as they read this book. As a result, this book comes off as self-indulgent and made me wonder if her next book will feature a romance between a thin, beautiful, and wealthy woman and a tanned former-movie-star turned bon vivant (Steel is now dating George Hamilton). My advice? Steer clear of this one.TTFN, Laurie Likes Books All About Romance ..."
3,Not as advertised,"Chose the Rating as the Product was advertised as New, but writing inside the book would indicate otherwise. Not what I expected"
2,Insulting to the independence and strength of women,"I was disappointed by the character's lack of strength when it came to the men in her life. First of all, she has put up with her unsupportive 2-dimensional character of a husband who makes the final decision about their marriage, and lets the second man in her life, Paul Ward, decide if and when their relationship will evolve. It didn't seem like she wanted to have a say in that at all. India Taylor was not a strong character. She was weak and relenting and by the end I couldn't stand reading about her life...."
5,Clever Witty Plot; I want MORE,"This IS a classic Steel. No more of her begging for sympathy, no more of her experimentation with new and quirky books. She's back with her wild fantasies."
4,Good Old Steel,I love reading her books while travelling. This book is just back to herself - the way we all like Steel. So what if we know the ending from the first chapter - this is why we like reading it. Only the last 20 pages were to fast. If I could only find a lover like that;-)
4,Too Good To Be True,"It's my first time reading Steel, and I just loved it. It would be any woman in the situation of India, a dream come true to find the kind of love she found on millionaire Paul Ward. After all she went through, it would be very disapointing for me if the story wouldn't have ended the way it does. I just wish life could be like in this novel, sometimes and for some people."
2,Drivel at its best,"I have read Danielle Steele forever and usually like what she writes despite being far-fetched. This one took the cake. It is obvious that she has no clue what being a middle-aged, suburban mother on a middle-income is like. Come down out of the clouds Danielle and meet some real women."
1,Don't waste your time,"This book was really bad. I only finished it because I hate the feeling of leaving something unfinished. The writing was sophomoric, written as if the reader had absolutely no memory of what transpired on the previous page. The author kept repeating and repeating - obviously just to fill up some pages. I found the plot very predictable."
5,Bittersweet,"A story of a woman named India Taylor, who after a number of years of marriage, discovered that she missed her career as a photographer. She was very talented and well respected in her field before she married. She missed the recognition that a career could give, although she still loved her husband and 4 children. Her husband, was narrow and difficult and could not see her personal struggle. In fact, he was totally against her starting up the career again. As the book progressed, India began to stand up to him because she did not want to lose who she was a person. In the end, she chose to pursue her dreams despite the obstacles. This was a moving and inspirational story with a romantic and happy ending!"
3,Take a bath and snuggle up to this hum dinger.,"Danielle Steel has done it once again with this beautifully written piece about a lovely gal named India. I'm home alone a lot, while my girlfriend is at work, but I certainly did not mind being alone when I was reading this gem of a book. Keep the ramen brewing, because I'm going to read it again! Note: if 'Bittersweet' seems a little slow and cliche at first, stick with it because it gets really great mid-way through."
4,"Generic Plot, But We Love It Anyway","Bittersweet follows the typical Danielle Steel plot: Woman is captivating, current flame is jerk, she meets someone else, obstical comes up between them, can they overcome it? However, if we didn't eat up these story lines, Ms. Steel would be out of buisness. The plot keeps the reader turning the pages up until the very last line. That is my kind of book. If you love being kept in suspense until the end, then read this book!"
2,Typical Steel Fare,"Nothing new here. We have the insensitive husband who views his wife as nothing more than a babsitter and maid. We have the talented wife who has given up her career to raise a family. We have the zillionaire Wall Street type with superstar wife who is a tiger in his business dealings but somehow comes across as just a ""little bit wimpy"" as a man. This is formula stuff for DS. We've seen all these characters before in other DS novels. They're very hard to sympathize with. I found myself hoping they'd all drown on the zillionaire's gigantic sail boat. If you're a DS fan and have to read this, save yourself the money and check it out of your local library."
1,"pretty boring, pretty typical","I have read every Danielle Steel book ever written, and I would have to say this one was her most boring to date. You could predict where the story was headed from the start. I felt no empathy whatsoever for the main character. It had no twists and turns to speak of. Nothing to keep you on the edge of your seat. Ms. Steel should consider starting to write quality rather then quantity. Save your time (and money) and don't bother with this book."
5,She's Back!,"After the disasterious THE KLONE AND I and HIS BRIGHT LIGHT, Danielle Steel has gone back and wrote what readers want, a timeless romance. Good god, I am so over joyed, after THE GHOST, nothing next would beat it, and nothing still beats it.Nevertheless, BITTERSWEET is one bitter and sweet tale of love and loss."
3,A Pretty Story Told Weakly,"A fabulous-looking international best-selling author named Serena and her seductively handsome billionaire husband called Paul grace the ears of the listeners along with a fabulous-looking internationally known photographer named India and her repulsive attorney husband named Doug. India and Doug have lost the passion in their marriage, but Serena and Paul have not. As naughty Gail, India's best friend, says, ""You never know what's going to happen, do you?"" The plot, characters, and the global setting are intriguing; but they are marred by the telling. The belabored explanations of what everyone thinks and the frequent summaries of what has happened allow the listeners to know what will happen. Even so, there is something absorbing about the book BITTERSWEET. Not a relaxing piece of literature, it is still a story of strong emotions. Danielle Steel, with her love stories, entertains her readers and listeners. ..."
2,quality of view,The Bushnell Powerview 10x32 will make a great kid toy. because of it poor focus viewing quality this products will not make the grade. A range of focus should be part of its sale description during sale.
2,Not for me..,"I bought two for a vacation in Alaska last summer. They seemed perfect for what I was wanting, according to the description and published specs. But, they saw very little service because of the difficulty finding the target, keeping it steady, and focusing. Focusing was extremely hard. We could not use them at all and we both tried. A more expensive and higher quality binocular may have worked. Even an inexpensive 7X50 would have been okay for what I wanted. Bushnell makes good stuff, but this 10X32 binocular did not work for us."
2,Ok set of binoculars,"I wasn't expecting much for the price of these binoculars but something basic for hunting where I could make out deer at about 200 yards at dusk and dawn when shooting light wasn't abundant. I was in a field facing NW in the afternoon as the sun was setting and behind the field was a tree line. Once the sun went behind the tree line, maybe the angle we were facing or the conditions that day but the glare on the binoculars were horrible it made them pretty much useless and nothing more than paper weight.Also, the string that comes attached to these binoculars aren't interchangeable with after market parts and poorly designed so you have to move them before using the binoculars as they tend to cover the eye pieces.Hopefully, these will come in handy in a different location but don't expect too much from these. There are reasons why some binoculars with the same power and design go up to $2000."
3,"Neh, you could do better","Not very solid - felt shabby. Definitely smaller than I thought (or hoped). If you're thinking of buying these for the theater, it's a bad idea. If you get headaches easily, you might want to buy a set that doesn't make you squint so much.All in all they work, but I was disappointed in how uncomfortable they were to use for longer than 10 seconds at a time."
1,You cannot use it with eyglasses,"We bought two pairs; one for my son and one for me. The review said kids can use it and those with eye glasses, but it did not work. I do not recommend this product for those who wear eyeglasses or kids. My 8 year old son told me it is too heavy on his neck and we returned them, but they received our return package, but have not refund me. for couple of minutes till my son complained about the weight. One pair is unopened and the other is used only. Two months passed since Amazon received my return parcel. Be careful to order it there is any chance you might return."
3,Bushnell Powerview 10x32 Compact Folding Roof Prism,"A good buy for a first-time pair of binoculars. However, it is a bit heavy. So, I am not using it as much as I would like to."
3,better than decent,"Bought as a gift for my father. he needed something small and lightweight which these are. I dont know how clear and how crisp the ocular qualities are, as Ive not been the one to use them. But he hasnt had any complaints."
2,Pretty Bad,"These are very poor binoculars. The optics are very low contrast, no very sharp, very difficult to focus, flare easily. The focus wheel has lots of slack and feels junky. The eye pieces have very little tolerance, frustrating to use. Pay a little more and get something you will enjoy."
3,OK midsize binocular,"I think these are OK for the price, but I would get the 10 or 12x25 instead. the size of these is just too big. the subcompact size is better.with these I might as well carry full size 10x50's. they will not fit in a fanny pack, where the 10x25's will, and also fit in a large purse. the 10x25's could be used at a concert But these are just too big to take.but the price is pretty good so 3 stars."
2,Had to return them.,One of the lens' was out of line with the other side & also had a smudge or something on it that I couldn't get to come off. Returned them.
4,Great value and Quality!,"Great power for concerts and plays and compact to carry with you anywhere. I like the holder with the belt clip, it keeps my hands free to cary other things like tickets."
4,Decent for field trips,"These were a Christmas present for my grandson and he liked them to go out in the field with to spot target hits, they are light and easy to carry."
5,Good product,Works great at sporting events I like how it is easy to focus and adjust if need be. Great brand
4,I like it so far,"It is compact and easy to carry. The string you wear around your neck can get hurt b/c it is so thin, should make it more bigger and comfortable to wear around neck. Bushnell works fine and it just take a little time to get use to when you first use it. But overall, I am fine with it."
5,BUY! BUY!,"I own a pair of Bushnell 10x25 which I used for hunting because they are compact. These, at 10x32, are just about 1/2"" longer but the 32mm lenses allow so much additional light that these are now my default hunting binoculars.I made out quite well as they were on sale and cost me only as much as my 10x25 did.I also own a Bushnell archery range finder with which I am very pleased."
3,pleased with purchase,I needed this item quickly and I received them on time. I used them for a football game and I was in the nosebleed seats. I'm glad I had them so I could see what I was looking at :) The binoculars served their purpose but because of my lack of experience I had a somewhat difficult time getting them adjusted for my eyes. The instruction pamphlet was written in lettering so small that I had to look them up online so that I could read them. Overall I am pleased with my purchase and the value for the money.
2,"Reasonable content, but awful printing","Like another reviewer, I've found the book difficult to process due to the TERRIBLE print quality. There are unmistakable artifacts of scanning, as if the entire book was photocopied, page by page.Unfortunately, this makes the diagrams quite difficult to decipher at times, and makes for an uncomfortable reading experience. Items supposed to be discerned by shade are difficult to interpret, details are difficult to make out, and text quality is generally unacceptable.It is worth noting that mine is a ""second"" edition - I have to wonder if perhaps Addison Wesley lost the master and then had to scan them for reprint."
5,this book was so awesome!,I think this book was the best! The ending was such a surprise! Once I picked it up I didn't want to put it down! I think everyone should read this book!
5,Sherryl Jordan won't dissapoint you,"I've read two other books by this wonderful author, and all were wonderful, this tying with 'The Juniper Game,' and 'Winter of Fire,' my favorite of all time, swopping down just ahead. But the tale was wonderful, and held you up through the entire story, eager to see how it would turn out. At the beginning, Rocco's character wasn't a very nice person. But at the end he trasnforms, from a rash teenager, to an experienced, and wiser teenager. A wonderful read, and if I remember correctly, I cried. A must read."
3,Questionable title,"I haven't personally read this book. Being a direct descendant of William Carvin Winters,who was a Second Sergeant and related to James Washington Winters, Jr., both of whom fought at the Battle of San Jacinto, I find the title of this book misleading. Out of the 100+ Texians who took part in the battle, only nine were killed or mortally wounded, so I don't know how the author of the account could possibly consider himself the only survivor. That is, unless he was the last surviving participant of the battle, since all others had passed away by 1923. Even this is questionable since he would have been at least one hundred years old by 1923.[...]"
3,Listening Between the Lines...,"...this is an OK album, but rather dulls in comparison to the rest of their catalogue. Dave Edmund's production sounds just a bit too polished on some tracks (although it sounds right at home on ""Between the Lines"") that may have ben due to the fact that they were on the Sire label at the time. I miss the raw production of the earlier works which I believe would have carried home the great performances.Despite all this, the remastering is good and it does justice to hear it in ""Between the Lines""."
1,yellow brick road,"the film starts out well. gives you a story to follow, baits you along and then ends like a worthless m. night snore along film and ends with no real resolution. why does everyone on the road kill themselves or others? what is the historical point of ""walking"" ? the girl who walks off the cliff with out a scream or a thud sums it up, she couldn't stand being alive any more than anyone with a desire to be entertained could want to rewatch this ""epic"".DON'T BUY THIS DVD. my shredder can handle dvds and that's where it will go to keep anyone from asking ""hey lets watch yellow brick road"" at my house again. DON'T BUY THIS DVD!"
3,No Subtitles Again,"This review is for the hearing impaired.If you select Subtitles with this DVD the only choice is ""invariant language"". Invariant, by the way, means constant or unchanging. I have had this option on other disks and sfter choosing it I got English subtitles. However with this disk it seems to do nothing as choosing it does not enable subtitles, nor are there closed captions."
5,Wear the hat,"There have been mixed reviews about this movie, but genius almost always gets a polarized reception. You can't watch this movie once and expect to ""get it"". This movie creeps into your bones. And stays there. It is a ""must see""."
1,waste of two hours,this has got to be one of the dumbest movies i have ever seen. the entire story line makes no sense and the ending also make no sense what so ever. if it were possible i would give this 0 stars but since i cant i will give it 1. do not waste your time or your money on this movie.
2,didnt care for it,could have been a good movie.....as it went on it got dumber & dumber? in the end I didnt know what was going on except a bunch of people lost in the woods killing each other. sad cause the plot stunk & could have been a hit.
2,Boring,"If there is one thing a horror film should NEVER be, it's boring. This movie is terribly boring. Dull. Uninteresting. Etc. Lots and Lots of talking, standing around, doing nothing. Even the action can hardly be called action. Worse, the characters do so many stupid things, I was starting to cheer on the villain...whoever/whatever that may be. Example? They bring cotton balls to block out a sound they suspect drives people mad. Cotton balls. Then there are all the unanswered questions. Do not watch this movie if you want closure at the end of a film. You won't get it. In short, this is almost unwatchable. I had to constantly stop the film, do something else that was more interesting...like laundry, and come back to it. It was a chore to finish."
2,All of It,"This had all the ingredients to be a great story. Very interesting back story, a slow build, and a capable cast. The problem is that the slow build stays slow, even when things start happening. The movie felt much longer than 1 hr 40 min. Possibly with better direction and a stronger cast it could have peaked nicely. This is not a slasher movie, so don't go into it thinking that otherwise you will really be disappointed. The beginning of the movie felt very Blair Witch to me. The creepy legend, trying to interview people, getting lost in the woods, people breaking down, etc. It is not done in the found footage style though. I thought the ending was terrible and not very satisfying. If you have nothing to do and this is a free stream on Netflix or such, maybe give it a try. But don't buy this one."
1,Seriously? Scary? I don't think so.,"Wow, totally screwed me out of my 1-1/2 hours of life. This movie blew. Not scary. Little if any action. All psychological and none of it makes sense. The cover is extremely misleading.Avoid at all costs. To bad I had to give this even one star."
1,"Possibly, The Dumbest Movie I Have EVER Watched.","The Title Says it all. The Dumbest movie, i have ever watched. The movie has No Point, and is very Ridiculous.I Didn't understand, Any Of it. This group of people, are writing, a book, and go down a place Called ""Yellow Brick Road"" The Road Plays Music, and drives them crazy. Incredibly Stupid, and Unprofessional, Don't waste your time with this movie."
1,Yellow Brick Road,"That was an abomination. It was an hour and a half of 'People go missing, they hear music, then go crazy.' Just like the last group. I understand the end and it's metaphor, but the entirety of it all was comprised of nothingness and unsatisfactory drama. Its mostly talking and screaming. Some of the parts were hard to watch, not that they were disturbing in any way, but that they were presented in a manner that was more vexing than entertaining. The methods used to make the movie were sub part to Marylin Manson's methods to demonstrate 'Horror' in his movies with subliminal flashes. I wish I had my life back. At the end of it all, I had to watch Ninja Turtles to make it all better."
1,GROAN.......SNOOZE,"Wow....this movie reminds of co-worker I have, she can talk for hours without having said anything meaningful.Most certainly a talented cast because they had to memorize so many lines......endless talk, throughout most of the movie. You could have condensed the action of this movie in 10 minutes max.It's been a while since I saw such a boring, pointless movie. I would give 0 stars if I could."
1,I'm here to help you,"Do you want to find a more productive way to spend nearly two hours? Sure you do. Then I'm here to warn you to steer clear of this piece of garbage. More and more of these ""real occurence"" home video shot style Netflix time fillers are being churned out to the dismay of intelligent viewers.It's always the same. The hook in these , ""wow, whats could it be"" films is just that, hang in there to see what real ""horror"" it is. In this case it's a bunch of femininely streaked men and shockingly unattractive women running throught the woods in search of some mysterious 1940s townfolk deaths. I gained insight into nothing from this supposed real event. It's the one hundreth repeat of The Blair Witch Project in the 2000's. A very bad movie. I need to take my own advice."
2,"Very good build up, no payoff, stupid ending - wasted effort","Good, creepy build up; but fails completely in the end. A group hiking a trial that previous travlers supposedly traveled but never returned from; a large section of population from a town having vanished in the process. Read the other reviews for the nitty gritty details. Very cool premise and build up, but when you do that you have to pay off in equal amounts - this doesn't, not even close. It's extremely disappointing they could not have come up with a better end (to the Yellow Broke Road...). I understand not answering all the questions and wanting to leave an ending with some deep creepy questions, but they dont' pull it off here. It is much more of WTF type of ending. It left me angry and disappointed they had not delivered at all on the build up. Somebody please remake this movie and come up with a real ending, geeezz. Glad I had only rented it."
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!!!!!!!!!,"DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!! THE SHIPPING IS NOT FAST AT ALL. I SENT AN EMAIL TO THE GUY ASKING WHERE MY STUFF WAS AND HE JUST CALLED ME LOSER. I RATE THE PORDUCT ITSELF 5 STARS BECAUSE IT CAME IN VERY GOOD CONDITION, BUT THE SERVICE I RATE 1 STAR BECAUSE THE GUY IS A MORON. I WILL NEVER DO BUISNESS WITH THIS GUY AGAIN! I DONT RECOMMEND HIM TO ANYONE!!!"
5,Engrossing read!,"This mystery reads as well today as if it was written just recently instead of over 50 years ago. My interest held from the first. Period details were, of course, accurant and an important part of the story. Today's world made ""who done it"" somewhat easy to guess, but it was the clues and how they were found that I appreciated. They say this was considered the first ""police procedural."" That's why I bought the book. That, and the missing college girl angle."
3,"Neat logo, shirt size too small","I love the message and the feel of the fabric, but the shirt size run too small -- not similar to the standard American Apparel shirts."
5,"Best arrangements, good-sized print",A variety of extremely musical arrangements for each pieceSABSATBSATB w/descantThe print is large enough for inter-generational choirs.This alto's all-time favorite!
3,If only I received the correct product!,"I didn't even receive the correct item! I received the regular, 120 tablet, no MSM bottle, which doesn't work as well for my hair. I've used the Plus MSM bottle before and it worked wonders. The product shown is great, I'll be getting another when I finish the regular 120 tablet bottle."
2,Very disappointed...,"I bought these because I was impressed with the ingredients. Unfortunately, once I opened them - they are GINORMOUS! I can swallow pills - but NOT these huge, hard ones. Can't return either. Out $20."
4,I would recommend this product,"I purchased this product just over a year ago, I grew 2 new large patches of hair in two spots on my head, where I didn't realize I had lost any. I have not had new hair growth in the thin areas on my head where I was hoping to but the fact that I did grow new hair while taking it, is why I give it a good rating. I have continued to take the product, hoping that maybe I just need to give it more time before I see new growth in the real thin areas."
3,Haven't Notices Any Difference Yet,"I started taking this supplement about 2 weeks ago and haven't noticed any difference yet. I know it can take awhile for something like this to start working, but I guess I was expecting faster results since so many others had stated how fast it worked for them. I also found out in the last month or so that I have a low-thyroid which can cause hair loss. This could be why I haven't noticed any difference. If you are experiencing hair loss and haven't had your thyroid checked, consider asking your doctor to run your THS levels. Just a thought."
1,Too strong for a human being!,"I had very high hopes for these vitamins after all of the positive reviews, but after taking them for less than 5 days I went through so much trouble because of them. Not only did my urine turn almost neon yellow but I developed a constant tummy ache, and a crazy appetite. I gained 3-4 pounds in just 5 days because of them.I am aware that my reaction might have been one of the more extreme ones but I had never before had problems with vitamins, so if it happened to me, it might happen to you too. Overall, these vitamins are extremely strong, and as a friend of mine says ""You are paying for an extremely expensive pee."""
4,spinning jennies sounding,"If you like power pop in the vain of spinning jennies youll love this cd .It is fill with power poppy tunes and its a lot of fun,from see for the first time,to golden arrow ,to bleed on the outside this cd is great .And youll hear such influences as reo speedwagon ,and bob mould ,on this cd ,its well written ,and well played, as all jeff sheltons projects are.I hope this review was helpfull to you"
3,Good but...,"I enjoy this double disk set but few of the songs have any memorable beats or melodies. Try ""Little Buddha Bar"" for higher quality music."
3,There are better options...,"The Buddha Bar sound can be defined as the sound of Asia, put through a Chill Filter, and tuned for Zen relaxation. And if you like that sound, then you'll love the albums from Hong Kong's Celestial. Check them out, they are titled:Hong Kong Dub StationHappy ValleySpirit HouseAnd these album probably take a deeper step into Asia, possibly because they originate from there."
4,Gooder,Great original tunes........Appreciate being able to find this cd on the internet. No good music stores withing 100 miles.Thanks
2,There are better CDs of this type out there,"I was drawn by the high reviews and listmaina rating, but was dissapointed with the content. I'll try to stop by the bar when in Paris though."
1,Big disappointment,"I have all Visan's cd's, as well as the rest of Buddha Bars, and he is all the time the same. You can not just say difference between Chill Out in Paris or his Buddha Bar compilations. This compilation should not been called Buddha Bar, but somehow else. This is not worthy of Buddha Bar series respect. Big disappointment, even I did not expect much, especially getting it one month after great 'Siddharta, Spirit of Buddha Bar' by DJ Ravin."
1,"Good Lord, this music is bland!","Don't get me wrong -- I'm a big fan of ethno-techno & worldbeat chillout music, but this Buddha Bar disc manages to take an otherwise exciting, vibrant genre of music and render it completely mundane and uninvolving. All the tunes are just so bland; they plod along in a very conventional, new-agey kind of way with the occasional tabla, flute or monastic chant thrown in to lend a vague exotic feel, but you just sit there wondering when the real musical journey is going to start. It never does.For those looking to explore the wide range of excellent ethno-electronica out there, Buddha Bar is not your starting point. Instead, check out some of the big names of the genre: Loop Guru, Shpongle, Banco De Gaia, Bill Laswell and Makyo are all in a league far beyond this meagre compilation. Don't waste your time on Buddha Bar."
5,moondances camel,an awesome gem from one of the top jazz prog- rock bands of the 70s .....if your a camel fan its a must buy d.v.d
3,Wish it had been more extensive.,"Most of the Camel reissues we have seen are labors of love, posessing exclusive bonus tracks as well as a wealth of photos and informative liner notes. These give us a more detailed glimpse of what went on during the recording sessions, and lend a little more insight as to why such a fine band dissolved into a slightly disappointing Eurock act in the mid eighties. This CD unfortunately, is not one of those releases. Every bonus track is available on the DVD 'Moondances' (which I have), and the amount of information contained in the liner notes gives no extra insight into the tensions building within Camel at this time(Camel Productions website would have been more informative). There are a few previously unseen photos, but there are a couple of CD's in my collection (such as Mirage) that were released before the rest of Camel's early catalog were remastered, and the liner notes and photos in these CD's were more extensive."
5,for those of us who remember...,"This kind of epic rock album with movements akin to classical were once wildly popular thanks in large part to bands like Pink Floyd and RUSH. While Camel hung in the background of this genre, their musicianship and compositional prowess are just as valid today as they were in the 70s/80s. Thanks to Bands like Muse, it appears that many of these more classic rock bands are being dragged out of the dark recesses of my memory, and this album in particular has the ability to transport me to distant landscapes and simpler times. I'm glad I found it in CD form so I can play it in my car. The last time I heard it I was quite small."
5,DANCING IN THE RAIN,"One of Camel's best albums, every track is great, especially with the awesome SHM. Must have for any CD collection, but don't pay these ridiculous over-inflated rip off prices. I purchased mine from The Music Specialist on E Bay, save yourself a ton of cash!"
3,Should I get this one?,"If you are a Camel fan, then you should get this one.Don't get me wrong. I love Camel, so I really like this album; however, if you just start going with this band, you should go with ""Camel"", ""Mirage"", and ""The Snow Goose"" first.Anyway, a great album, but not as good as the other three."
3,B-league prog rock.,"This is considered one of Camel's finest recordings. Such a claim could be percieved as being accurate. The sad reality is, however, that Camel are really nothing more than a second rate British prog-rock outfit. The addition of Caravan's brilliant bassist, Richard Sinclair, can't save this disc from being what it is, a second rate outfit at their best. There are better bands worth exploring than this flacid, dull, uninspired outfit. Look to Gentle Giant, early Genesis, 70's era Yes & King Crimson, PFM, ELP, Tull, and Focus for stronger output...Simon"
5,It's About Time!,"I've been waiting years for Rain Dances to receive the remaster treatment that the 1st four Camel LPs and the Live Record enjoyed. I am pleased to report a job wonderfully executed. This version has a punch the original Decca cd lacked...to keep it short it sounds fresh, bright and clean w/ some volume added...it's been in my car since I received it last week...The bonus tracks to me don't really add much, I actually wish they were left off: the single version of Highways of the Sun and 6 live audio tracks from the '77 Sight and Sound footage found on the Camel Footage dvds (which are beyond essential) .Now I am crossing my fingers for Breathless, I Can See Your House From Here, Nude, The Single Factor and Pressure Points to see remasters (Stationary Traveller was remastered by Andrew Latimer and can be found at Camel's website). Overall a wonderful new updated package w/ great liner notes and killer sound...Enjoy this great LP by a criminally overlooked band."
5,Good mirco review for microbiology class,"I used this book for my medical microbiology class as a study tool and found it quite useful. It highlights all you need to know for fungi, bacteria, viruses and parasites. I also referenced the following:Tortora's Microbiology TextandPatrick Leonardi's Microbiology Study Guide: Key Review Questions and AnswersTortora's book was really easy to understand and Leonardi's study guide was vital for my complete test preparation. These three books were of great help."
5,Great transaction.,The book came in perfect condition wrapped in plastic and in a box with styrofoam fillers.
5,Sensational stuff!,"Erik Simmons says in his foreword: ""This stuff works"". I've been using much of this stuff since 1994 and it does.This book explains it better than anything other than Tom in person. Buy it. Read it. And then go and listen to Tom talk about it.It will change your life."
2,2.5 stars,"After folding in 1984 Camel made a return in 1992 with this recording. Unfortunately, it is not much of an improvement on 84's Stationary Traveler. As with S.T. production spoils this outing. The drums and keyboards in particular sound dated. The drums are too loud in the mix and are further spoiled with a too liberal use of echo. The keyboards rely too much on a tacky sounding electric piano. Latimer also fails to play with his usual brilliant flair. The songs are not particularly interesting and Susan Hoover's lyrics (which are typically quite good) give way to overused cliche (""we need you so""?). It's a shame as Latimer and company are capable of much better. Things improved some (but not dramatically) with 1997's Harbour of Tears. It was not until 1999's Rajaz that they truly returned to form. Rajaz is an inspired and complete effort. This recording, Dust and Dreams, unfortunately is not...Simon"
4,john steinbeck-inspired prog rock.,"based on inspiration from the novel ""grapes of wrath,"" by john steinbeck, this is an outstanding work of prog-rock. lots of space surronds the majesty of camels sound here, and andrew latimer's guitar work is wonderful as always. pink floyd fans should love this stuff. great music by an extremely talented outfit of musicians."
2,Wasted one full day reading this book,"-Little UML that makes sense, even less .NET (not to mention the links between UML and .NET - 10% of this book?)-Too much UML and modeling process freestyling.-Can you take an author seriously if he keeps on quoting large blocs of text from other books and weblogs and particularly the ones from the Gilbert comic strip? How about one that not only uses ""stick-man"" symbol, but also provides his own personal ""stick-pet"" symbol?-the whole book seems like filled with personal comments and stupid jokes."
3,"Sharp Author, professional issues though","Martin is a sharp man with great thoughts on UML... however Martin was working for us through Robert Half Consulting and left us mid project with no warning and no follow up, he just picked up and left. I think a crucial part of the development process is that your development team stays put and if someone needs to leave they give you fair warning and also give you the documentation/coding to allow you to complete your project, I am just saying..."
1,Poor construction,Only took one shot of .45ACP to go from cover to cover once the course was over. Weak.
2,The book is pretty much useless,"Make sure you get a good teacher, because the book is pretty much useless. I have a good teacher, so I am fine, but I couldn't imagine it being the other way around. It basically has formulas in it with no explanations."
1,Full of errors,This book has errors page after page. Poor examples and no answers in the back to see if you can follow the dribble typed out before the practice problems.Don't purchase. I've used it in two class at two different schools and I still say it is weak!
1,Unacceptable Text,"This text is largely a mass of theoretical discussion with very few example problems to illustrate concepts. A large percentage of the problems that are used as examples are hard to follow, and others have obvious typos. Language is too formal and, at times, condescending. This text was required for an undergraduate course in Engineering Economics. My understanding is that this is the first year it was used at my college and, due to large number of complaints, will be the last."
4,A lovely Easter story,"The Egg Tree is a great story about a little girl's Easter morning egg-hunting experience. Though she is unsuccessful, she does uncover a wonderful Easter suprise. The little girl, and the reader, is introduced to the Pennsylvania Dutch technique of painting eggs, when she finds a cache of her grandmother's beautifully decorated eggs. The examples of folk art throughout the book are wonderful, and easily accessible for children. This book will prompt your family to begin their own egg decorating tradition."
4,Starts with the Easter Bunny,"We love the Egg Tree idea, and the way Katy discovers the old painted eggs. We don't have the Easter Bunny (Rabbit) as a family tradition, and this book starts and ends with him. Also, the book uses ""Easter"" and ""spring"" interchangeably.We love how the family keeps the egg-painting tradition alive and shares their light and the beauty of their tree with their neighbors."
4,"The Egg Tree, excellent children's book.","This book contains a wonderful story that children of all ages will enjoy, and should be exposed to. It is a great story to be told around Easter time, and it is a must have for any accomplished or imaginative readers' collection. It may be a children's book, but that is no reason why you shouldn't check it out for yourself! I hope that this may help you decide to look into it, and I am certain you will like it."
1,DO NOT BUY,"I recently purchased this product. I bought it because it seemed to be eco-friendly, healthy for my cat, and claimed to be clumping litter and odor-free. It is ANYTHING but. I have experimented with many types of litter. Being in graduate school and broke, I tend to buy clay-based litter because it's cheaper. The grocery store in my neighborhood had this product on sale, so I figured I'd give it a whirl. NEVER AGAIN. The litter does not clump as well as other litters, if at all. It clumps into tiny balls making it almost impossible to remove from the clean litter. Also, the STENCH coming from the litter box is repulsive. I have to hold my breath when I clean it. Granted, litter boxes typically aren't something I want to sit next to, but the entire first floor of my house smells disgusting thanks to this litter. I have never had such a problem with litter before. I will never EVER purchase this product again. I'm in the process of requesting a refund from the manufacturer."
4,I've had good luck with it.,I've used Swheat Scoop for the past year and I'm pleased with it. I started out by mixing it with regular clay clumping litter and now use just the Swheat. I haven't noticed a lot of dust. The cats try to eat it sometimes. I have never noticed bugs.
1,Grain Beetles - Litter INFESTED,"I've been using SWheat Scoop for almost year and thought great product..until I started noticing tiny black bugs infesting flooring around the litter box. Took a while to realize bugs connected to the Swheat Scoop. I tried removing the BOX and keeping litter in air tight container but found More Bugs. So I examined the litter and its well, Littered w/ tiny BUGS. This isn't one box..its several months of boxes.I am alerting the pet store but likely the Litter is infected. You wouldn't notice these bugs unless sweep them onto white background. Gross...switching litter immediately (have no idea to what). good luck."
3,Mice love it!,"I've been using Swheat Scoop for about a year and have been pleased with it's clumping and flushability. It does track out of the box, but the cats think it's good stuff. Apparently, mice think it's good stuff too. I discovered that the bag stored in my bathroom closet had been chewed through. Now that I removed the bag from the closet, the mice risked life and limb to get to the litter box and my cat has caught three of them in the past 24 hours. No more Swheat Scoop for me, now that the mice are onto it. Too bad -- it's a good product."
2,No No No,"It's litter. Cat's will use it. But really, are you sure you want them to?1) No odor control.2) Creates an ungodly odor when mixed with cat urine. I would go so far as to say it's vomit inducing.3) It sticks to the bottom of the box so that you're ""going at it"" at every angle to scoop it off the bottom. I have some sturdy scoops - they've held but but we've worked at it together to clean that box.4) Gooey sticky clumps.5) Too light that it just flies across the room - tracking it everywhere in the houseYes, it's environmentally friendly. As we were trying to transition to this (and we've used it for about 3 months now) we recently purchased clay litter again... we have 5 boxes in our house (yes, insane, I know) 3 in the unfinished basement and two on our main level. There are 2 out of 5 boxes with clay.... they're the ONLY boxes the cats are using.I agree with them. Once the litter's used, it's gone!"
2,Not as good as I had hoped.,"I tried this litter hoping to find a natural alternative to my current clay litter. It has a nice consistency but it's fairly dusty. After it's used, the urine sticks to the bottom of the litter pan so much that I really struggled to clean the litterbox! Feces were barely covered up and the odor control is non-existent. In fact, after one day of use, there was a strange sour smell that filled the room from this litter. This was even after the box was clean. I had just tried a pine litter which worked great for odor control but the urine didn't clump as hard. I will be trying World's Best litter next and definitely won't buy this again."
1,Dusty and TRACKS like crazy,"With a new wood floor, we're especially sensitive toward litter that tracks. Thus far, this has been the worst. Even with all the matts we have around the litter box, it tracks EVERYWHERE. And its terribly dusty."
2,doesn't form clumps you can actually scoop,"It's great in theory, but the clumps fall apart too easily. Not worth the hassle if you want a litter that clumps and stays clumped."
1,Messy and no odor control,"This is the worst cat litter I've ever used. It left a mess, both on my floor and into the other room. The dust was everywhere! Whenever my cat did his evening constitutional, I could smell it on the second floor! Uuuuugggghhh! I have discovered that Cat Country (wheat pellets) works 150% better."
5,10 stars if possible,I've used almost every brand on the market. This stuff IS the BEST. When I clean the litter box I don't sneeze anymore. That is a big deal to me. I used to sneeze for up to a half an hour after cleaning the litter box when it was the clay litter. This stuff is SO good that I forget to clean the litter box because it just doesn't stink. I find myself needing to write reminders.
3,My Experience,"I have 2 cats and was looking to get away from clay litter for health reasons (long-time ScoopAway user). I am a regular scooper - every other day, two days max. I feel this is reasonable. I have tried crystals, Feline Pine, and SwheatScoop. At first SS worked great - great odor control AT FIRST, little dust AT FIRST, but now after 3-4 months of regular scooping I am noticing stronger odor than clay and MUCH more tracking than clay - and some dust! It doesn't matter how much litter is in your pan: cats like to dig! One of my cats is a very enthusiastic digger - cats WILL dig to the bottom of the pan, or close to it - and this stuff is MORE DIFFICULT than other products to remove from the bottom of the pan. I have a mountain range forming at the bottom of the pan that I regularly have to chisel down with a chisel - the scooper won't do. I am hoping World's Best performs better, but I'm not getting my hopes up."
2,"A comparison to ""World's Greatest Litter""","I have used World's Greatest Litter for a couple years, and saw this on the shelves. So I decided to try it. Here was the result:1. Swheat Scoop is cheaper than World's Greatest2. Swheat Scoop is more fun to say.3. Swheat Scoop is less dusty than World's GreatestNow for the bad part:1. I am very allergic to the dust Swheat Scoop causes2. The clumping sticks like glue to the bottom of the box, no matter how deep I filled it.3. The instructions on how to use it were in the bottom of the bag, which didn't halp until I'd already used most of it.4. The litter tracks much worse than World's Greatest, since the clumps are harder, they stick between paws easier, and are transported to all areas of the house.5. The litter is harder, so when you step on a tiny clump with bare feet, it hurts more. Only thing more painful is Litter Pearls.So overall, I am not impressed. Your mileage may vary."
1,Beware the Meal Bugs - Forever!,"Because this litter is a wheat product, it attracts meal bugs. My bag actually came with the bugs in it - when I opened the bag, left it in the bathroom, and came back a few hours later, the bugs were crawling out of the bag and up the wall. I have done everything to eliminate the bugs. Naturally I disposed of every crumb of Swheat Scoop. But once you have these in your house, it is very difficult to get rid of them permanently, due to the life cycle of meal bugs. You think you've eliminated them, and then a few months later, they're back. Do not buy this product, even if you think it works great as a cat litter. You run the risk of being plagued by bugs forever."
2,"Wow, that dust travels","Pros:* Very, very cheap* May be healthier than clay-based* Not a bad odorCons:* Clumps are VERY difficult to remove from the sides and bottom of box* I found white dust everywhere within 5 feet of the box, including on top of the refrigerator, and on pots and pans above the refrigeratorI started using this to get away from the possibly harmful clay dust. I was pleased with how cheap it is. That helped me overlook the fact that it was a workout to get the clumps out. But after a year of use, I could no longer overlook the extremely fine white dust that was accumulating on my peanut butter jars on top of the refrigerator. I am now using World's Best, which is more expensive, but worrth it. Buy it from Amazon or PetfoodDirect."
1,swheatscoop for rabbits,"One of my rabbits found the swheat scoop irresistable to eat and an impacted stomach has resulted with my rabbit now being in the hospital for the last few days, with this litter impaction located in her stomach. Subsequently I found out on a quick web search that there is information on this product and its detriment to rabbits, on the HRS, house rabbit society website, as well as several other online locations. I'm certain this product is great for cats however, and I would continue to use it for my cat if I didn't have rabbits."
3,Use lightweight or metal pegboard,"The molded plastic pins on these bins are suitable only for sheet metal or very thin (1/8"") pegboard. They don't lie flat against thicker (3/16"" or 1/4"") board. Unless you put something heavy in them (like metal lathe jaws) which bends them down but probably weakens the pins. Other than that, they are nice ... good size and well packaged. They stack fine. Paid about $10 and no tax or shipping with Prime account."
3,Not bad.. but not too good on pegboard,"These little bins are ok, but if you plan to hang them on pegboard, they only hang well on the cheap, thin stuff. Tried using it on regular 1/4"" pegboard and the little prongs on the back just aren't deep enough to hang on it. Other than that, they are ok. Nothing special, but nothing bad to say either."
1,Not for pegboard use,"Despite the advertising to the contrary, these bins cannot be mounted in any reasonable way to standard pegboard. Sure, the pins line up to the holes, but they are not deep enough to allow the bin to hang horizontally, and weighing the bin down with contents bends the pins nearly to their breaking point. The bins stack on top of each other, but this takes up valuable workbench space - which is why I wanted them on the wall. On the plus side, Amazon made the return very easy."
2,Does not fit on peg board,Has clips in the back but does not fit on peg board. They are stackable but that to is a little tricky to accomplish. Would not recommend these if you want them soley to hang on a peg board application.
1,Not for pegboard,The description states these can be used for most sizes of pegboard. Bull $***. They only go on sheet metal and if you have 1/8 pegboard they don't sit correctly. A total misrepresentation of product. Got them today sending back tomorrow.
3,SMALL like Tiny,I purchased these to test them out for the space and items I would put in the bins. I decided to go with the Gladiator small bins sorry these are just to small for my space.
2,Does not fit flush with pegboard,"I bought these to use for my pegboard, but the pegboard holders are not long enough, which is causing a large gap between the bins and board. Wanted to use these for nuts and bolts, but because of the weight of these items I'm sure it will snap the little bin holders overtime."
1,Does not fit standard peg board well,"I bought these bins for a shop project, but when put on peg board, the bins will not lay flat against the board."
3,"Low cost, but these are very small boxes.","These we smaller than I thought they would be. The price was cheap, so I can't complain too much. Good size for screws and other small items, but you will not be able to fit anything more than several inches. They stack, which is nice. Units arrived on time and in good condition."
4,space saver,"Wonderful stackable feature, makes great space saver, sturdy material, perfect solution to my organizing needs, works great for hardware storage and organization! Would recommend it."
3,"Okay, but only for edging lightweight paper","If you use these decorative scissors on 80 lb. card stock or paper of a lesser weight, you should be fine, but when I attempted to cut an edge onPetaloo - Glitter Paper Sheets - Red White Pink and Chocolatethese scissors chewed the paper, but didn't cut an edge. If I tried to use extra pressure on the scissors, they locked up and wouldn't cut at all.Another not-so-great feature is the short length of the cutting blades on the Fiskars Paper Edgers. They will only cut 2.5"" at a time, so you have to keep lining up blades to the cut edge, if you want to cut a longer length.The decorative-edge scissors that I use most often areFiskars 98987097 Softgrip Pinking Fabric Shears, which are quite a bit more expensive, but they cut a longer edge, and you can use them on heavier paper or cloth. Unfortunately, there isn't a large variety of edge designs in this product line."
3,rather dated,"The Mexican government has closed many of the runways covered in this book, whose last update was a 1999 supplement. In other cases the airport condition has substantially changed. Talk to fellow pilots before relying on information in Air Baja."
5,A must for every pilot's bookshelf,"This manual is necessary for any pilot's bookshelf. Kershner's manuals are not written as test guides, but they provide the knowledge with which to understand airplanes more fully and check out in advanced models. This book should be purchased and read shortly after obtaining the private pilot's license and before purchasing a test guide for the commercial written. Kershner's wealth of experience and easy humorous style makes for easy reading. He backs up what he says with appropriate equations and diagrams, and this makes for an authoritative source. One should not be scared off by the equations, since they can be ignored, but are available for reference. The diagrams are not slick and in color, but they do the job and keep the cost of the book down."
4,A realistic view into the world of heart surgery on children,"I read this book when I was younger, yet it left a lasting impression. This novel is a sensitive look at the anguish that is felt by a little girl facing heart surgery, yet it is also is very realistic in its portrayal of how a hospital runs, and what anyone can expect when faced with a lengthy stay in a hospital. I really reccommend this book for anyone of any age who is facing surgery, but especially for children."
3,It Can't Hurt Forever,"The book was very informative, but to me not entirely realistic--not all the characters are very likeable. Also, I found the children in the book improbably precocious. While I think most children could handle the material, some may be upset by it."
4,Some gems.,"All I have to say is buy this album for tracks 2 and 5 alone. Both are amazing and smooth and edgy and powerful and very complex and creative and catchy. They stir up amazing emotions. And of course, the classic Suspicious Love is on it as well. You can't go wrong. And their follow-up to this album, Sensor, which was just released this year a decade later, is amazing."
3,perfectly satisfactory,"Camouflage's new disc reminds me of that Botticelli painting, ""The Gargantuan Love Trial of Eduardo Unesterio,"" with broad colorful strokes and deep, deep hues. Of course, it's a rock record and rock is good. It's like my uncle told me, ""you put some guitars, bass and drums on there, add some vocals, and voila, rock and roll!"" Keep on rockin', Camouflage."
1,review of bodega bohemia,I was not to impressed with this album. Maybe if i had'nt heard their earlier stuff. I thought the vocals on some of the songs he was trying to sound like billy idol no thanks i'll keep my old albums from them.
1,Couldn't even finish it,"The first thing you need to know when picking up this novel is that it's part of a series and if you haven't read the other ones you might as well just put it down now. I love Lindsey and I picked this one up hoping the more romance, intrigue and drama that I've come to expect. Wrong! The plot is so convoluted and filled with references to the other novels that it's like wading through the mud trying to figure out what's going on. The characters have zero spark and there's no reason to even hope they get together. My attitude throughout the entire book is ""I wish this would just end already."" It didn't do so fast enough so I just gave up."
2,Unlike Lindsey,"I was very disappointed when I read this book. It's nothing like all the other, what I consider GOOD, books by Johanna Lindsey I have read. The plot made no sense at all to me and I was constantly putting it down and going off to do something more intresting. I suppose Ms. Lindsey is trying a new theme for her romances but I think that she is really best at sticking to historical settings and historical characters. In the mean time, I suppose I will have to make do with my supply of old Lindseys."
2,Let's hope this is Johanna's low point,"Johanna Lindsey is my favorite romance novelist. Sadly, Heart of a Warrior didn't live up to my expectations. Sorry, but Dalden the warrior/alien/barbarian didn't do much for me-- warning, folks--this book contains an attempt at science fiction. But Lindsey, a romance novelist, doesn't quite know how to go about it. Stick to romance, dear.The romance in this book is the only thing that is saving it. At least I could believe their love for each other.I can understand that someone who writes as many books as Lindsey does will have a book or two that doesn't live up to the quality of the rest of her books. Sadly, this is one of those few."
1,Warning....This book is a sequel,"I started to read ""Heart of the Warrior"" thinking it might be an interesting read. Little did I realize this was /not/ a stand alone book. After the first promising chapter staring a 30 yr old virgin (hmmmm), we progressed on to the SF portion of the book with the hero named Dalden.Soon, I was overwhelmed with sci-fi jargon and long interludes featuring characters from other books. This would be fine if kept to a minimum. Unfortunately, it wasn't. Since I have never read the other books I have no clue who Challen or his lifemate are...And didn't particularly care, I quickly lost interest. This seemed more like a 'reunion' book than a romance.Perhaps this book might be good for those who've read the others in the series and want to find out what 'happened' to the other characters. For someone new to the series, I just couldn't grasp it, and this quickly became a wall-banger."
2,Heart of a Warrior,"This book was boring, little to no connection or content of previous books, Warrior Woman and You Belong To Me. Wait for the paperback. I have always valued Lindsey books, but with this one I believe I will trade."
1,Heart Warrior,"In three words, SAD, truely a sad piece of literary. This book starts off very slowly, and then it becomes confusing. I could not figure out within the first chapter what was the plot about. Then the bomb dropped, a sequel to Warrior's Women, which by the way was a good book. However, this story should be given to lost and found box. Try again Johanna, do what Stella did, GET YOUR GROOVE BACK. I skipped over so many pages just to get to the ending and even then it was not worth my time or effort, which, means not worth buying.Sorry"
2,Surprized at how hard it was to enjoy this book.,"This was by far the worst book I have read by this author. I usually thoroughly enjoy her stories, but this one was different. The female character in this story chose to "" not believe"" in the story herself. I don't want to ruin the plot... just in case someone decides to purchase the book. But I am very disappointed with this particular story. I have never struggled to finish one of her books. It usually takes me two days to finish one because I am ""glued"" to them... but this one has taken me a couple of weeks and I cannot seem to make myself finish it."
2,Disappointing end to an otherwise excellent trilogy!,"WARRIOR'S WOMAN and KEEPER OF THE HEART are two of my favorite keepers, but this third installment was very disappointing. I almost wanted my money back. Readers may want to skip this oneentirely."
2,Heart of a Warrior,"Heart of a Warrior is the third book in a series that began with Warrior's Woman. Though Martha's (the super computer)comments were funny in the previous romances, I felt that Johanna Lindsey went overboard with her this time. Martha's character dominates in this novel, often times spouting psychobabble or redundant information. Both Dalden and Brittany spend more time talking to her than to each other. The two of them seemed to have no reason to love each other besides the fact that they were both tall. I didn't appreciate the age difference. Alien or not, he was only 21 and she was almost 30. Brittany spent the majority of the novel not believing that she's left earth despite overwhelming evidence. Her refusal oversteps ""stubborn."" It soon becomes just plain stupid. This novel only served to make me miss Warrior's Woman--a far superior novel."
2,Better stick to your historical stories and romances....,"I love your historical stories better...Futuristic stories lack your 'usual' charm and I agree with some of the readers who have written their comments about this book and the other futuristic-books-you-have-written.I did not finish this book... after a few hours, I got bored and uninterested."
4,Cut Johanna a Break,"While I agree that this was not my most favorite Ly-san-ter novel, it wasn't still a good read. I'm a sucker for any novel that allows me to revist characters I already love. Johanna has delighted us with so many store lines, I think we can cut her a little slack on this small one. Besides, the cover art alone on the paperbacks are worth the price of the book anyday. I remember buying my first Johanna Lindsey book without ever reading the plot simply because of the amazing hunk on the front. I'd always assumed the cover art was simply skilled drawing, so you can imagine my joy the day I found out that particular gentleman, the mane of gorgeous hair and all those beautiful muscles were real! That point aside, once I quite drooling over the cover and actually got into the story, I became a Lindsey fan for life and I continue to buy any book she creates."
2,dalden and brittany's tandem,"are you sure about that? Is this book really depicted the love story between Dalden and Brittany? As I have read it, it was more of Brittany and Martha that played the scenes and no more. I haven't got the chance to know more about Dalden! It was always Brittany's childish whims, always about her insecurities and I hate it! It was repeatedly whinned in there until I gave up but continued it though, for a paid for this book. Anyway, we can't expect JL to write funny-filled stuff forever, can we?"
4,Touching,"Being a fan of romance for romance novels, I really didn't mind reading an author I already knew a little and liked. But among all the books I've read so far from J.Lindsey, this one has been linked in my favorites. Not only it included elements of ""time-travelling"", a kind of romance I really like, but it also is written brightly, colourfully, and with a lot of information about the characters. Moreover, these characters are really living in the reader's mind throughout the pages, which makes the book a great one. I suggest it strongly to the ones who like romance, but in a different kind. It almost makes you wish to be a Brittany!"
2,Fun read but not as good as the other two books..,"Heart of a Warrior is a fun light read but lacks the passion of Warrior's Woman and Keeper of the Heart. The punishment scene was frustrating after such a build up and then nothing happens. I was glad that Dalden finally got his own story and revisiting Challen and Tedra (Warriors Woman)was good. I would have to say don't waste the money, wait for this book to come to the library."
1,Stinker,"I've read many of Lindsey's books and liked them, but this one was awful! Who gave this a sensuality rating of 8? No way--a 2 would be more appropriate.If you like the earth-alien type of stories, read Dara Joy's ""Knight of a Trillion Stars."" Much more exciting, other worldly, and ROMANTIC!"
1,What happened?,I have picked up this book three times and put it down after reading a few pages. I forced myself to read 3 chapters and I don't think I can continue. Normally I get pulled into the story & it would be a fast read but.... I'M VERY DISSAPOINTED!
3,Mixed Feelings,"Heart of a Warrior left me with mixed feelings. It is a good story that could have been great. I have read all of Johanna Lindseys books. Usually, I would describe them as intense, unable to put down. This book left me wanting more. It seems incomplete. The relationship between Brittany and Dalden is not exploerd in great detail. They were more like secondary characters. A computer named Martha seemed more like the main character. Also, some of the major moments were left out. Ms.Lindsey would build up to them, and then move on to another part of the story. On the positive side, This story is very easy to visualize. the settings and people are described in great detail. Also, we get to revisit Challen and Tedra from the first novel in this series. Overall, don't expect the intersity associated with this author. However, as a light fun read this book is fine."
2,Dissapointing,"i must agree with [others] this book was sadly lacking. it had no fire whatsoever and it seems that...the ending of the book seemed rushed...nothing was developed very well. i expected something more out of this book. More passion, more conflict with dalden and his heritage, but nothing.my advice? save your money...a nice read, but not worth [the money]"
3,What a let down!,"This book was a real let down! I had waited so long for Dalden's story and I am glad I did not buy the book. There was no ""fire"" in this story. I got the feeling that Johanna took so much hear about Keeperof the Heart that she was a fraid to really let go with this one. I too would like to see a story about Fallon's brother, but it needs to be written by the ""real"" Johanna Lindsey! Also, I would like to see some more Mallory stories. Save your money, check this one out from your local library."
1,"Johanna, Johanna, Johanna, what is happening?!","Another disappointment! First, with ""the heir"" and now this book. I think her imagination needs a ""jump"" because it's as she's running out of ideas and now the stories are getting too bland, not enough romance and just too many characters and plots. Just keep simple Johanna, the way you used to do."
1,So disappointing,"I own and love several Johanna Lindsey novels. This is one of the worse by far. Daldan is boring; Brittney is rather stupid and purely self-aware only. HOW can she decide that all of these people, animals, and [in her mind] special effects are only to mind-screw her. Seriously?? I could only skim this book, it's too bad otherwise. The very sad part is that the two previous books in this series were great and I loved them...but this is a major waste of money."
2,Not JL best work...,"I agree with many of the reviewers regarding this novel. When I first check this book out from the library I didn't know that it was part of a series. So the flashbacks didn't bother me. However, what did bother me was the total lack of chemistry between Dalden and Brittany! There was no romance, no passion and I don't know where that 8 sensuality rating came. The only thing they had in commom was their height which was the first thing that attracted Brittany to Dalden when she first saw him. He had his mission and she was basically his guide. Where was the romance in that? There was way too much Martha. She never shut up. Brittany was about as bright as a piece of wood. Her refusal to accept that Dalden was from another planet despite the constant proof namely Martha, his spaceship, his planet, the huge house cat ect... was so annoying. I am just glad I didn't buy this book."
1,Oh how I looked forward to this book.,"Oh how I looked forward to this book and what a major disappointment it is. One word describes it: boring. The major characters have no appeal and there's so little plot. And, quite frankly, I was hoping in vain for good sex."
1,Not worth the read,"I can't believe I am about to say this about a Johanna Lindsey novel. I did not enjoy this book at all. I admit I had taken a bit of a break from her books as I have been reading Diana Gabaldon so I was unaware of the two previous books in the series but UGH! Dalden did nothing for me with his warrior's ""control"", Brittany's disbelief gets old real fast, and there seemed to be no plot whatsoever. All in all, quite a disappointment."
1,WHAT HAPPENED?!?!?,"I am a huge Johanna Lindsey fan and after reading WARRIOR'S WOMAN and KEEPER OF THE HEART, I couldn't wait to read the third installment. What a disappointment! The whole book is based on the heroine, Brittany, talking to the computer, Martha. There was barely anything going on between Brittany and Dalden. It wasn't even Dalden who got to save Brittany when she was attacked by some animal on his planet. by the time he shows up, she is already brand new again. The book seems to be more about the friendship between Brittany and Martha then about any romance between Dalden and Brittany. The first two books in this series were excellent and worth repeat reads. This one, though, is a disappointment."
1,Not Sure This Qualifies For Even ONE Star!,"Wow--was I ever disappointed! I haven't read Lindsey in quite a while, so when I purchased this book and started reading it, I kept having to double-check the cover to make sure this was ""The"" Johanna Lindsey writing this book. It was awful! The computer (Martha) drove me nuts with her continual remarks and interruptions in a plot that was hard enough to believe to begin with!!! Where, oh where, did Johanna Lindsey go??? If you love Johanna Lindsey's historical romances, you will be so disappointed in this! P.S. ""The Pursuit"" was another disappontment. Although it is considered historical romance, it severely lacked ""romance"" and a believeable story. I found myself opening up her old books a re-reading them--they're, by far, better than what she's been doing lately."
1,A Complete Waste of Time,"I started to read Johanna Lindsey to see why she's a bestselling author. Frankly I'm still trying to figure it out. The whole book was incredibly silly, and there were plot holes you could drive a truck through. I guess once you're a name like Lindsy you don't have to try any more (I understand some of her earlier books are quite good). I guess it could also be that futuristic fantasy type stuff doesn't work for me, but even the romance portion was pretty dull stuff."
1,Ugh. What happened to Lindsey?!,"Johanna Lindsey used to be one of my favorite authors but over the last several years, her work has gone steadily downhill (for me).The first, almost 1/4 of the book is a vague and muddled history of Dalden's mother and sister's lives. (I didn't read those books), so it was very confusing. Lindsey used to be able to intermingle characters from her other stories seemlessly, but not here.Brittany's character who is supposed to be intelligent, independent and self-sufficient, allows a strange, 7-foot ""foreigner"" to sleep over as soon as she meets him. How naive and unreal.Martha's presence is annoying and detrimental to the couple's development, though it doesn't matter here, as there's no real development. Nothing interesting anyway.Big pass, and I will be more leary of buying any of Johanna Lindsey's works in future, until she gets her stories back in shape.Ugh."
1,A Big Disappointment,"Johanna Lindsay authored ""Angel"", one of my all-time favorite romances. So, I was sorely disappointed when I bought ""Heart of a Warrior"" and started reading. I kept waiting for it to get better. Instead it steadily went downhill. There was absolutely no chemistry between the hero and heroine. Ms. Lindsay is so talented, I hope she will return to writing the kinds of stories she does best."
3,Different but Good,"I really enjoyed this book and am not an avid Johanna Lindsey reader. But reading ""The Heart of a Warrior"" made me want to find the previous two as I was told there should be. Pooh on the fans who didn't like it. EXPAND your mind PEOPLE! I enjoy a varity of romance in my reading and like the new ideas Johanna came up with. Certaninly it was different but that is what I like about it."
5,Better than the other novels of this family,"Heart of a Warrior is the best of the series I Personally couldn't stand the thought of a woman being punished that's why I didn't like the other ones. Okay so she does get punished but not severely and its great what happens afterward when I read a book I like to laugh and this one had me laughing hard. There wasn't much that I didn't like so it wasn't perfect for me but every one has their own opinions, the things was that she was 28 American and a virgin not that its impossible but highly unlikely and how did her family feel when she up and disappeared? huh? well Nothing is perfect but this one came close."
2,Is it just me?????,"I read a few of the other reviews first, just to see if I was the only one. I have been a BIG fan of JL for over 20 years, so I can't help but doubt that ""Heart of a Warrior"" was even written by her. I'd hate to think she has ghost writers, but it took me over two weeks to get through this newest novel, and it usually only takes me a few days. Way TOO much technical and background information, and the supercomputer, Martha, had more of a major role than Dalden and Brittany did. I also have been upset the last few years that her books come out in hardback first and won't go to paperback for a year. If the rest of you JL fans are getting tired of this and would like to read great stories with great passion and flow, check out a Teresa Medieres novel. I fear she will become my new favorite romance novelist."
1,Ugh!,"After reading the superb ""Warrior's Woman"" and equally terrific sequel ""Keeper of the Heart"" I was sooo let-down by this pathetic end to the Ly-san-Ter trilogy. This book was BORING!!No other word for it. JL's good writing days are over."
1,AWFUL,Save your dollars. Check this one out at the library. I give Lindsey one more chance after that she's off the instant buy list!
4,She Loved This Book!!!,"The item shipped very quickly, and I am very satisfied with my purchase, and I would recommend this item to a friend."
2,Disappointed,"Like many other reviewers I have read everything that Johanna Lindsey has written. When I first read what the plot of this book was I cringed. I was not thrilled with the other futuristic novel but it's a Lindsey so I had to read it. I was so disappointed, more than anything by the lack of billed-up in the book. Not to mention the inconsistancy. I mean, how could the heroin leave the planet and her family not even be mentioned. I wont stop reading her books because I do love all the others, but don't read this one as your fist Lindsey novel, try any one of her other books."
2,Review of Heart of a Warrior,I have read all of Ms. Lindsey's books. This particular one was really disappointing. The end came too fast. The rest was really boring. It took me 4 days to read. Usually only takes me a few hours. Futuristic books are definitely not MS. Lindsey's claim to fame. Sorry.
1,Heart of a Warrior,"I have enjoyed all of Johanna Lindsey's books up to now but this book, which I am listing to the unabridged audio tapes, is the slowest and most boring book I have heard or read in years.The story drags, makes little sense and sometimes there just seems to be words to fill up space.Johanna, I am still a big fan of yours, but please stick to what you do best and stay away from this type of storyline."
1,Where have those characters gone,"Once I would have bought a Johanna Lindsey book without reading the back cover or any reviews. That was until ""Say You Love Me"" ""The Heir"" ""Joining"" ""Home for the Holidays"" and now finally ""Heart of a Warrier"".Now I kinda read the reviews and story line and maybe hold off a day or so and then buy the book and pray that the brilliance of all those earlier books is back.Well after Heart of a Warrier, no more......I can honestly say that I disliked the female lead and was disappointed that Dalden got lumped with her. She was shallow and I would have been quite happy if Tedra had thumped her once or twice.From now on, I'll just re read my favourite Lindsey novels and let the new ones alone."
1,Boooooooooring,"I love Ms. Lindsey and eagerly wait for her new book to come out. This one was a major disappointment. The computer, Martha was annoying. I'm glad I didn't spend any money for it. I got it as rental from the local library. It's been left on my nightstand from day one. I tried to read it a couple of times but couldn't get into it."
3,Fun but not really logically,"I was in love with many characters in ""Warrior's Woman"" like Martha (my favourite), Tedra and Challen. ""Keeper of the heart"" was OK for my point of view, the story a little light and more social compared to the first one. But I'd rather disappoint with this third book. I do like Dalden and I am even understand about how I felt so annoying with the part that Brittany gave her hysteric and disbelief to everyone. But it was so ill logically and abrupted when Martha took Brittany to the spaceship and left the planet. The author have left this part like unfinished business and move to another chapter and gave an answer which was to me very unrealistic to be true. The rest of the story is OK. I really do enjoy to read but I do not think this book is the best of the author."
1,Very Disappointed,"I felt the plot was forced and stilted. The romance was not evident. And I actually had to force myself to finish the book. I have collected all the other books out by this author and have always waited patiently for the next book. I'm left feeling she is just not as interested in writing with the same quality and attention getting detail, drama, and romance that true fans have come to expect."
3,heart of a warrior,"Just a quick note to say this book isn't associated with ""You Belong To Me"". They are two different worlds and two different writing styles for Johanna Lindsey. I love Johanna Lindsey and buy all of her books even this one but I am not into futuristic types of novels and that is what this one is. For those who enjoy these types this is the book for you! Have a GREAT Read!!"
3,Disappointed Reader,"Martha was way too involved. There was way too much explanations on how things were. Brittany's disbelief of everything got annoying. Very little plot. I love Ms. Lindsey's ""Warrior"" series. But, this left me wanting more. I hope she writes another."
5,I read this book in one day.,I picked up this book ... yesterday morning and had it finished by 8 o'clock that night. It was a very good book. What interested me about it in the first place was that I was wondering if and when Johanna was going to write about Tedra's and Challen's son Dalden and this is his story. It adds both futuristic and modern day to this story. You will find some old friends and some old enemies but again you will find a love story worthy of Johanna Lindsey. When Dalden is asked for help he has to go to a world that there are just rumors of having life on it and when he gets there he finds the rumors to be true. He finds he will need the help of someone from this planet and she is more than willing to help him. Together they will find a way to help each other and to find the love of a lifetime. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and think you will too.
2,Very disappointing.....,"I have been a fan of Johanna Lindsey since I started to read romance books some 15 years ago. I was anticipating reading the follow up to Warrior's Woman and Keeper of My Heart. I should have kept waiting. Keeping in mind of the poor reviews this book recieved, I had borrowed this book to find out first hand if the book would live up to my expectations of a Johanna Lindsey novel. I am really sorry to say it did not. The book dragged on with Brittany not believing what she was seeing. It had the potential of being a great book if the characters would just have some form of spark between them.The book kept going over what had happened in the 2 previous books, which was a disappointment since I have read both books, repeatedly.This does not prevent me from buying future books, however, I will be hard pressed to buy one just because Johanna Lindsey wrote it, which is what I used to do."
1,Lukewarm Milqetoast Offering,"If you expect to see the father in the son - you'll be sorely disappointed. Dalden is NOT his father's son. This one in the series suffers from a lack of romance, good plot and is outrightly shallow. The fascinating world of Sha'Kaan is barely delved into and for this reader, Ms. Lindsay has done us fans an injustice. The heroine is hard to like or empathise with. She spends the last two thirds of the book in complete denial - if Ms. Lindsay is to believed - three months of being unable to accept Dalden for who he says he is despite both his and the brassy computer's repeated attempts. Oh, good grief!!I had a hard time finishing the book and I wondered why I ever bothered to in the first place."
2,A poor third installment...,"If you loved ""Warrior's Woman"" and ""Keeper of the Heart,"" then like me, you were anxiously waiting for Dalden's story. In a word, the book was ""pathetic."" There was just too much story, and absolutely no chemistry between the characters. Who really cared about the whole conflict of the inter-worlds? And Dalden's punishment was a joke! It is official now, after many disappointing new books, Johanna Lindsey has lost her touch."
1,Who wrote this book? Not Lindsey,"I understand that it is a standard practice for romance writers who are successful to get a break and let someone else write using their name. However when will Johanna wake up and smell the coffee. As with the past 4 books. This book does not measure up. The problem here is that we have to pay more for hard backs and we should get more for our money, not less. I used to purchase ALL her books. Now I just borrow them or go to the library. Her books USED to make me want to read them over and over again. Now I struggle reading the book once. I don't know who is editing these books, but they should have their head examined. This book could not have been written by the same person who wrote the first two books in this series."
1,Very disappointing,"It was like wading through a science text book. I love her historical romance, but this had me desperately trying to find some spark with the characters. There is so much background information before we ever even get into the action, so much telling instead of showing, which breaks all the basic rules of novel writing, that I wonder she ever thought that all the details about the heroins roommate and the heroes entire family, sister, brother in law etc, was even remotely important compared to the essential aspect of romance: the hero and heroine are shown to fall in love."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"Some books are meant to be published in hardback; this one certainly wasn't. It reminded me of STAR TREK: V (the one written and directed by Shatner); it's format would've been suitable for a tv movie, not a big screen. This book, too, didn't need to be a hardback; it's a total waste of money. In fact, it's even a waste of money at mass market paperback prices."
2,Dull as dishwater,"Heart of a Warrior is a lesson I will not soon forget. (Referring to unabridged audio book version) Dalden sounds great, too bad he chose Brittany as his life-mate because she slept in his arms so comfortably. Boy, was he robbed. Brittany's skepticism became so nauseating I started to hope one of the Sha-Ka'an creatures would take her out. I dearly love all Johanna Lindsey novels with this big exception. Save your money and buy older Lindsey novels."
1,THIS IS AN AWFUL BOOK!!,"Let me begin by saying that I have been reading sci-fi for over 30 years and love the genre, but this supposed sci-fi/romance is just plain awful!! The science fiction part of the story is extremely derivative of old Star Trek shows (""phazers"" for ST's phasers, etc.), the plot is threadbare, and the romance is totally unbelieveable. The talkative computer, a plot device used to explain things to the dense heroine, is extremely annoying (why does she keep calling Brittany ""doll""?). And doesn't William Morrow (the publisher) have any editors working for them? The book is very choppily written, especially the first few chapters setting up the aliens' back story. Johanna, please give up the sci-fi pretense and go back to what you know best, writing historical romances!"
3,Heart of a warrior,It was ok. Not wat I expected. Would not recommend to any one. Just not my type. Hard to keep up.
3,mixed feelings,"I have to say that of the three books this was the first on that I read and I happened to like it, but then I saw that I had read the 3rd book before the first 2 so I went and read the other to and I have to that Heart of a warrior even thought I had liked it was saddly lacking compare to its prequles. I have to say that had I read warriors women and keeper of hearts I would have be very disapointed in Heart of a warrior and would never have finished reading it. but I guess I'm glad that Heart of a warrior was the first book I read and not the last."
1,Without Heart,"Without mentioning the rape and explicitly violent books written by the author, this is her very worst. An interesting read at from the begining to the middle, but after that-dead in the water. Anyone ever notice the enormous amount of twins found in JL's books? Also, unless it is a sequal, there is a suprising lack of a maternal parent in virtually all of her stories. Although the character had a mother in this one, she is suprisingly(or rather unsuprisingly) absent. Not once does this girl think about all the wory her mother is going to experience as a result of her disappearence. Furthermore, I'd like to meet an American woman who would put up with being PUNISHED! But then again I'd like to meet an American woman over 25 who is still a virgin. A little realism in my fantasy please. Don't waste your time with this one."
2,Sucks,"Really, this is disappointing! I wonder if this is a romance novel or a fantasy narration. Brittany and Dalden barely interact enough to fall in love. In fact, there are more ink of Brittany interacting with the computer Martha than with Dalden. There is virtually no sex scene, which makes this book unbearingly dull. Brittany is not an impressive lead character, rather stupid and stubborn. How could she keep convincing herself that she is in some fantasy programme?! This romance just doesn't hold water."
3,Riding Down,"When I heard about the latest speed racing game with Sonic The Hedgehog, I definitely was interested in what made the guide tick. What Brady Games made out of the strategy guide for Sonic Racers for the PS2, Nintendo Gamecube, and Xbox was not what I was expecting it to be. The guide showcased the requirements for each of the characters, but I was wrong about the whole feeling about the maps. The maps were definitely flawed a little bit out of focus, and didn't really display the game and each of the tracks as detailed as gamers would need the help. I just hope that another company puts out a better strategy guide for Sonic Riders.Price: C+Maps: C 1/2+Convience: C 1/2-Overall: C"
4,Wonderful for introducing children to classical music and composers,"This book and CD was recommended to me by a friend. It is a wonderful way to introduce children to classical music and the composers. I am using it to teach a class that includes ages 4 through 10. The CD contains short sections of well known classical music and words have been added that includes information about who wrote the music and something about them. The kids really enjoy marching or dancing to the music and the words help them retain the information that they need to know for the class. The book is sectioned into the different musical periods and includes short biographies about the composers, along with key dates and vocabulary. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the musical quality isn't as good as you would get on a traditional classical CD with full orchestra. Regardless, it's a wonderful resource."
4,Truly introductory,"Although the book by Valdez is truly introductory it does give a good overview of financial markets. It is a pity that Black and Scholes' model or binomial trees are mentioned as too difficult. Different option strategies are mentioned but not explained. One or two graphs would have made it a lot clearer, but as the writer indicates on several occasions, that is outside the scope of this book. For a more thorough understanding of financial markets this book is a good introduction but not enough to really get a good idea."
5,clever and charming,"this book has recipes for Holiday Treats, some humorous, some Totally Delicious. Directions are clear and most ingredients are easily available to the average cook. The Resources section is great for unusual supplies and equipment. Try the Kitty Crunchies for April Fools Day-a good gift for any cat lover. The text is fun and informative, and the pictures helpful. Totally recommended."
5,baking,"This book was for my daughter...It is easy to follow, has nice pictures, tells origin of the treat and even gives you info on shipping recommondations...we checked itout from the library then she had to have it."
5,good,"Good book, lotsa info, lotsa pics, good for first timers, haven't tried alota recepies yet but have atot of other candy books"
2,Don't waste your money,"there were a few good recipes, but other than that, a waste of money. Not only were alot of the recipes not ""common"" or even appitizing, but the printing was very bad. In the middle of the book, they duplicated about 20 prior pages and then left out about 30 additional pages. I was so upset, I contacted the supplier. They did give me my money back, but I was very disappointed. there are a million other books to get if you're looking for a candy making book. don't buy this one."
1,IT IS NOT LOTTE LENYA. WHY DON'T YOU HAVE HER?,"WHO ON EARTH ARE ""VARIOUS ARTISTS""? IT'S OK TO SELL THIS RECORD BUT WHY DON'T YOU CARRY THE ORIGINAL? LOTTE LENYA IS UNIQUE."
5,East Coast Viewer,"Thoroughly enjoyed the movie, Would recommend it to anyone who is an Alex O'Loughlin fan."
3,Passionate film about one woman's journey to freedom!,"This was a truly passionate film about one woman's journey to freedom: Mary Bryant, who was transported to a penal colony in Australia for stealing (just once) out of desperation & hunger. Mary Bryant, played superbly by Romola Garai, must do unthinkable things in order to survive the harsh world she now finds herself in. The action in this film is intense and rarely lets up...Please be aware that the content of this film is an R: there is disturbing violence (including sexual violence), nudity, sex and more. This one was a bit of a hard one to watch, as the content was very strong and intense. However, Mary Bryant's story is quite moving, if you are willing to wade through the strong content. Her passion and will to live are truly inspiring."
4,entertaining historical drama,"A beautifully photographed, well enacted drama that explores the human will to survive the worse imaginable circumstances. Fortunately, this drama had a happy ending, except for all those who died on the way. I thoroughly enjoyed the acting and brilliant, natural colors of the movie.This film is important since Mary Bryant's story played an important part in reducing the extreme sentencing guidelines used by the English bench. One 13 year old girl around the timeline of Mary Bryant was sentenced to death for stealing a smock (refer to Wikipedia.org)."
4,great to watch,great story about the adventures of two people in love & trying to stay away from trouble. will recommend to othes
3,Needs to be HBO'd,"Interesting story and fair acting but visually disappointing. The distrubutor should run it back trough post production and re-set the look. Or even better, HBO could do a re-make!"
2,"the record is ok, but i don`t like the singer","i saw suffer play once in fagersta, sweden and after the show i met jocke in the public restroom, he came up to me when i was peeing in the ""ränna"", and he asked me if i could ""suga honom"" and ""pilla hans rövhl"". ok, the cd is ""ok"" but since jocke is a ""jävla pervers gubb jävel"" i can`t enjoy it to the max."
4,suffer? it`s not that bad!,"well, it`s not as great as the structures cd but it`s still has a few strong contenders for the ""svensk toppen"" hitlist. jcke (the singer) really know how to move the listener, with his beautiful lyrics about young school girls and 6 year old boys in tights."
1,suffer sucks!,this is not another madonna release. dont be fooled by the title. i am a big madonna fan and i was shocked when i heard this metallicawannabe cd.
1,Very Annoying!!!,"It works fine but is very loud. There is no way to turn off the sound. It would have been great if it just moved. Also, all three of my cats are scared of it and very rarely go near it. What's most annoying is when you forget to shut it off and as your walking by it, in the dark, it goes off and scares the crap out of you. It's motion and touch activated so if you walk even five feet from it, it goes off. Unless you don't mind the annoying and loud sounds and you think your cats will play with it, then don't buy it."
1,Ear Drum Buster,"This product is VERY LOUD!! Not only is it loud, it actually says, ""NAH NAH Na NAH NUH!"" Both my cat and myself found this toy to be most obnoxious. We would give it negative stars.... But they don't allow that."
1,Terrible,"This toy will scare your cats and drive you crazy. It makes a loud ""Nur nur nur nur nur"" and this weird laughing sound (nothing like a mouse). Simply terrible."
2,Only For the Brave Ones.,This is a really cute-looking toy but it IS loud. It would be best with a mouse squeek or at least a volumn control. My boisterous boy Buttons does war with it. It doesn't bother him and he'll play with it. The others don't seem exactly terrified but prefer to watch Buttons play with it from a slight distance. I think if it were quieter (or had no sound) they just might go for it. Buttons likes it so we're going with two paws-up.
1,Annoying,"I bought this mouse for my cats for Christmas a few years ago, and they were scared and annoyed by it. They had no interest in it whatsoever. I even took it apart and cut the wire to the speaker so it would shut-up, but the motor itself makes a lot of noise. The only engery my cats used was trying to get around the thing without going near it. It might make an interesting toy for some dogs though, but only if you can stand the noise."
3,"WoW, its Oh BONIc","Remember OH Bonic, probably not. I was just trying to think of the cd doing the worst on the amazon sales list, and i got to oh bonic, because i bought this cd years ago. I must say that the beats do get tired and they didnt put alot of thought into, but you find yourself listening to everysong, or at least the first thirty seconds of everysong. I recommend something better, like Moby, or chemical bros"
4,"Charming, But NOT E.B. White","While this has none of the depth of Charlotte's Web or Stuart Little,this is fun. Cutesy at times, but fun. Balletomanes will particularly enjoy this story.Readers who enjoy this tale should discover the ""Miss Bianca"" stories of Marjorie Sharp--they were dumbed down by Disney, but the real ""Rescuers"" is a delight, and I'm sure Miss Bianca would have had season tickets for the Ballet Rodente!"
5,Fascinating,"This love story is a very entertaining dealing with lives of women in a changing African society. It mirrors the social and cultural diversity of Africans and the depth of the African psyche even in the modern world. I enjoyed this rich, well-written, challenging and fascinating story.Usurper and Other Stories, The Village of waiting,Disciples of Fortune, Anthills of the Savannah, Triple Agent Double Cross are some of the other African titles I enjoyed."
2,unexpectedly disappointing,"i thought this movie was going to be great, it's an older flick with John Cusack that i never saw.....until NOW, and that's only because all i've been reading are great reviews...and personally the movie wasn't great at all....in fact...was quite disappointing...with a serious lack of humor and extremely cheesy acting and i was quite surprised at how BORING this movie actually was...and honestly, the flick doesn't even deserve a single star, and the only reason why i gave it 2 stars was because of the mere fact that John Cusack shines amongst my ""MOST FAVORITE ACTOR"" list.....bottom line, this movie is BAD and it lacks.....lacks....well uhmmm EVERYTHING!"
3,Given As A Gift Based On Various Reviews(Xmas 1999) (7/18/05)Updated :Reviewer abj),I liked the title and liked the plot and gave it as a gift(sight unseen).
2,Are you sure you want me to?,"Well I just watched this for the first time last night and I am still trying to figure out what is so damn special about this movie. After hearing countless positive reviews about this movie I decided to see for myself what all the hype was about. In a world of countless bad romantic dramady's I was expecting Say Anything to be a moving unsentimetal view of a new relationship. This is little more than your standard chick flick. Not to say that this is Katherine Heigle chick flick bad, but its also not a very original depiction of a new budding romance. Thier were scenes in this movie that made me cringe because of its cornyness. This would all be fine if I were a 17 year old girl but I happen to be a 30 year old man, and when a movie gets this much acclaim it should speak to all demographics. I am not trying to say that Say Anything is an abysmal mess but I do think that it might have been a more original movie in 1989 and has not been able to stand the test of time."
2,new?,"said new- no wrapping, no cover- just the plastic jacket. i watched it and had no problems- I just don't like buying something falsely advertised, no matter how much I paid."
2,Nothing to Crowe About,"I am astonished that this monumentally witless and unaffecting film wormed its way onto the AFI Top 500 List, or into the hearts of so many customers here at Amazon.Really, the only charm and intelligence on display here appear in the eyes of John Cusack, who is nevertheless undone by the dopey script and bovine leading lady.The chemistry between the leads is almost nonexistent, and their romance is paper-thin, even in this age of epic narcissism.I would feel sorry that the worthy John Mahoney lowers himself to earn a paycheck here as the girl's father, but he went onto redeem himself for the ages as Frazier's dad.I can only assume that the positive reviews here emanate mostly from young viewers who have never seen a classic romantic comedy like ""Bringing Up Baby"" or ""It Happened One Night"".NOT recommended."
3,Say Anything....,"Few weeks ago, i had this strange attack of the 80's. If you're one of those people went through high school and college through mid-late 80's you know what i mean. Well, on that whim, i bought a bunch of DVD's that day. i usually only buy ""keeper's"" on DVD, something i can watch over and over. Some of the movies i hadn't seen in over a decade, but they were equally good now, bringing the pleasant memories of the careless days. Except for Say Anything. All the other movies i bought that day ended up being great choices - ...i don't really know why this movie would be in top 50. Though a decent flick of teenage love, not deserving to be that high on the top selling list. Oh well, i bought one, i guess i'm guilty for it being that high..."
5,Wonderful love story,"This movie is for all ages about two very differnt high school students who meet and fall in love for the first time. With lots of colorful characters mixed into the storyline, and one controlling father, this story will tug at your heart strings.With the new DVD out, a new generation can enjoy the movie. The features are outstanding! There are deleted, extended, and alternate scenes for the true Say Anything fan and plenty of trailers and tv spots to choose from. But most enjoyable was the reunion of Cameron Crowe, John Cusack, and Ione Skye, together again for the first time to record the voice over for the commentary of the movie.I would recommend this movie, just for the boom box scene alone....it's a classic!"
4,"""Say Anything"" dvd","Although this film took about 15 minutes or so to get going, I enjoyed the mild twist and turns their relationship had. John Cusack was excellent! For viewers aged 30 plus, this film will be a trip down memory lane.scifigal."
4,Still Holds Up,"This movie does something that very few 'Teen' or 'Brat Pack' movies do today... it still holds up. This is a sweet touching movie that hits all the right buttons in the heart department but still remains funny to this day. Cusak proves in one of his early roles why he is still popular and a sought after actor today, the guy is GOOD."
4,Good Movie,"i am a huge fan of cameron crowe, and this is another movie on his directing list that deserves recognition. john cusack is perfect in this movie and i doubt that anyone could not fall in love with him after watching this film. it is worth seeing the movie just for the scene when cusack is holding up a radio outside of his girlfriend's house playing ""In You Eyes"" by Peter Gabriel. this is a good movie that is sweet and romantic. i would recommend seeing it!"
5,One of the best films of the late 80s,"Great little romantic comedy drama. This is when Cameron Crowe really knew how to make movies. Cusack hadn't quite perfected the lovable loser role yet (see High Fidelity for a later, better performance) but everyone does a great job. Watch this a few times, it's actually better the second or third time around - the mark of a good movie."
4,One of John Cusack's best,"This is definatley one of the ""must have"" John Cusack films! A wonderful movie, one of the best endings to a movie ever! I was kind of dissapointed in the DVD, however. The deleted scenes section could've been longer, and I guess I was expecting a little more bonus material.It is still a great movie though, and worth purchasing for any John Cusack fan!"
5,"Good film, good vendor","The film came promptly and was in good shape. I'd buy a DVD this way again, especially since its sometimes cheaper than renting."
4,Good classic 80s film,"I had not actually seen this movie and my husband and I couldn't find it anywhere to rent so we went ahead and bought it. It's worth having in our collection, a good story and nice nostalgia for the 80s."
5,Cusack Classic,"One of my all time favorite movies. Great characters, great love story. A movie that shows what falling in love should be about. Great soundtrack, Classic scene, Cusack playing Peter Gabriel's ""In Your Eyes"" over his boom box while standing outside his ex girlfriend's house."
5,say everything,"I love this movie. I saw it for the first time when it was new in 1989, and I've had it on video for years. So, when I heard there was a special DVD of the movie, I leapt at it. And guess what? I love the DVD. The movie is as sweetly complex as it ever was, and the three main characters are just terrific. The special commentary by Cameron Crowe, John Cusack and Ione Skye is enlightening. It's fun to hear them 13 years after making the movie. They are still sincerely excited about what they created. The deleted, extended and alternate scenes are worthwhile seeing. All in all, this ""Say Anything,"" says everything to me."
3,Not as good as we expected,"With the 5 star rating from Amazon.com, we bought the DVD. With John Cusack we thought it would have been a gem. We did the see a good chemistry developed between him and his girl. We would have modified the ending, as neither the girl or father seemed to have learned from their experience.Just expected more."
4,John Cusack's so cute,"I thought this movie was really good. Now being only the age of 18 i had never seen this movie for it was before my time. however after viewing i have to say that john cusack is really hot. Not to mention a really good actor. In the movie john plays the guy that all the girls want, someone to crush on you and would do anything for you. someone who would go to any lengths to keep you close to him. Of course only in the movies would someone like this exist."
3,Not exactly what I was expecting...,"Got this for my wife expecting the usual chick flick and was surprised that it wasn't anything like I thought it would be. Although it does have chick flick elements (the dramatic relationship-ending parts), it was more of an 80's drama on young adult life. I suppose if you are a big John Cusack fan you'll like it regardless. My advice, don't watch this expecting a chick flick but rather have no preconception as you approach it and you might enjoy it more than I did. :D"
3,"Not Bad, but Terrible Ending","Altogether, I thought that this was an enjoyable movie. However, I must say that the ending was very disappointing for me. I love romantic comedies as much as the next girl, but at the end I was left thinking ""come on!"" Of course, the guy gets the girl (big surprise), but you're left thinking that in a few years a breakup is inevitable as they grow and mature into adults. Maybe that's the point."
4,Remembering HS,"Say Anything is about a loser named Loyd who has a crush on a female nerd. They get into a relationship, hit a few bumps on the road and they live happily ever after (""when the sign goes ding you know everything will be all right"")It's not a complicated film but for anyone who was a misfit in HS like I was then you'll probably enjoy this film a great deal. And who hasn't had daydreams that they and their HS sweetheart would stay together forever and ever?"
4,A Guilty Pleasure,"This is one of those movies that isn't just a date film. Guys will secretly watch it when they're alone.Crowe knows how to mirror the range of emotions both sexes go through in the ups and downs of a relationship. It's this kind of emotional realism that attracts both sexes to his films. The men aren't plastic Fabios, idealized and unreal, meant to appeal to the escapist side in a female audience. The women aren't congenial Barbies, serving without demanding, meant to appeal to the escapist side in a male audience.Instead, the guys and the gals go through Hell, and it's the Hell so many of us have been through ourselves. Every guy has been Lloyd, sitting with his stupid friends as they try to console him with macho cliches... And it's this everyman touch, this commonality of experience between Crowe's characters and his audience that gets a guy to watch a ""chick film"" like this without a chick at his side."
3,Love the movie--the DVD still needs work,"I have loved this movie since I first saw it in high school. I've owned the VHS for years and watched it often. I still quote many of the classic lines with old friends to reminisce. It's a good, light-hearted 80's romantic comedy.Having said that, the DVD disappointed me. The first thing I noticed when I started watching the DVD was how the screen jiggled and moved slightly, as if I were watching it in a movie theater from a film projector. The color and sound are fine, and the deleted scenes and other extras are nice, but I think my VHS copy holds still more than the DVD version.I watch all sorts of movies on DVD, and I don't remember any that shifted like this one did. The studio apparantly didn't care enough to make sure each frame lines up with the next. Yes, I got used to the subtle shaking after a while, but I'm almost inclined to return the DVD and keep watching my VHS version."
5,Say anything....,"A classic.... Full of witty dialogue and humor. ""I don't want to buy anything sold, bought, or processed."" John and Joan Cusack are unique in all movies they star in together."
4,80's genre,"This movie is a goodie too. For fans of John Cusack like myself, it's a touching story of a a father who doesn't really give his daughter much time to socialise. John Cusack's character is in love with her and wants to get to know her better, but her father has other ideas. Great music and even Eric Stolz makes a cameo in it too. Watch out for him in a scene wearing a bird suit. It's a soft version of the teenage angst, but still delightful to watch."
5,probably my favorite movie,"I've seen this movie about 20 times and recently watched it with my boyfriend for the first time, and he liked it too. Ione Skye's father is played by John Mahoney, who plays the father on the TV show Frasier, and he does a great job, as do Ione Skye and John Cusack. This is my favorite role of John Cusack's. The movie is funny, warm, genuine and on target in its portrayal of young romance. It's also just the right length at 100 minutes. The movie is also more profound than most teenage movies, and I notice something new every time I watch it."
3,Teen Charmer,"A teen movie of the late 80's, I found this charmer, ""Say Anything."" John Cusak is the quirky misfit teen in love with the unattainable. The unattainable is the senior class brain, Ione Skye. Ione has a wonderful smile, which she uses to disarm. Her acting skills are limited however, so Cusak's antics move the story to the opposites-attract finale. John Mahoney, the dad in ""Frazer"" on TV, plays Ione's businessman, father in deep soup with the IRS. He wants her to go to England on a scholarship. She is wooed, charmed, and then makes it with shiftless Cusak. I must say that Mahoney is believable in a complicated character, both loving father and a secret embezzler. Ordinarily in these teen operas, parents are total dotes. There is the obligatory teen beer-bash, but this one is fairly realistic with kids that actually like each other, as opposed to bashes where kids are trying to be too cool. Nice little date flick for teens."
3,Movie,"This is a classic Movie! love it... I bought it to share with my daughter, since it's one of my favorites from years past!came in the mail quickly- within shipping estimation, but the tabs in the case were broken off and the disc was just rolling around in the case, I had to exchange out the case for another so the disc wouldn't get damaged."
3,I Want to Spend the Summer with You,"Lloyd Dobler (John Cusak) has just graduated from high school and he is in love with Diane Court (Ione Skye), a brilliant and beautiful valedictorian. Lloyd is about to take the chance of his life when he calls Diane and asks her out on a date, a date which Diane accepts without knowing who Lloyd really is. At the end of the date she feels very comfortable in Lloyd's company and they begin a friendship, which is getting more intimate with time. However, Diane is about to go away to college on a fellowship that she has earned through hard academic work in high school. Where is the relationship going? Well, if you want to know you should watch Say Anything..., which is an enjoyable coming to age film."
5,The greatest teen movie ever made.,"Say Anything is the most touching movie I've ever seen. For every guy who ever wanted to be with the perfect girl and could never have her, this is the movie. Say Anything is extremely funny without being biting, very dramatic without being sappy. There is no greater scene in movie history than when Lloyd holds up his boombox, trying to woo Diane back. Say Anything is what every John Hughes movie wants to be but fails, what every ""Hope Floats"" generic romantic comedy tries and can't do. It's a true masterpice.John Mahoney is one underrated actor. Him and John Cusack have an awesome rivalry in this movie, and they just have a great on-screen click. 8 Men Out is also awesome, as they both steal the show."
4,My favorite romantic comedy,"This movie is wonderful. I saw it for the first time when it first came out and it has held a special place in my heart ever since. It is a simple movie, but that is where it holds most of its charm. The relationship is beautiful and feels and looks honest and sincere. When the love in a love story is as believable as this, you can't go wrong. The chemistry just works and John Cusack's character is somewhat of a hero, in my mind. This character is a true romantic, whose weaknesses are as charming as his strengths."
5,Where it all began!,"It's just a shame that this movie came out in the John Hughes era as this is definetely the best of the teen movies. However, it's also the least watched of the teen movies cos hardly anyone knows about it.You have Cusack doing his usual broody acting, you have his sister being his contact with reality, the one-two act seen also in Grosse Pointe Blank, and then you have his love interest who's recent forray into the acting business was 'Dreams for an Insomniac.'However, this is different from all the other teen movies churned out at this time, something similar to whats happening in the Asian movie industry. This film actually has a plot, the parents in the film actually have some substance. It also has one of the funniest characters in all teen movies. The girl who's wrote hundreds of songs about her ex-boyfriend.Isn't it ironic how the best of the era always shines through though. They may have bombed at the time but now they're starting to come into their own!"
5,A perfect romantic comedy,"Although this movie could be classified as one of those 80's high school comedies, it really transcends that genre - it has a timeless quality that will appeal to anyone, regardless of age. There are more classic moments in this movie than I could list here - including the most famous scene where Lloyd (the totally adorable John Cusack) serenades Diane (Ione Skye) with one of the most beautiful love songs ever written, ""In Your Eyes"" by Peter Gabriel. A lot of the other reviews have mentioned how they wished they could find someone like Lloyd Dobler, and I am in complete agreement. He may not have everything in the world going for him, but he knows how to treat a girl right and love her completely, and that's what counts! Everyone should watch this movie - women can love it for the wonderfully romantic story, and it should be required for men to watch this film so they will know exactly what kind of man every woman wants!"
1,I Want My Money Back,"This is the worst video that I've experienced. It's what happens when video making becomes democratic. She lingers on a rat, yes a rat, in Venice. We watch her wash her cloths. They visit an Etruscan burial site, and act like teenagers at a horror movie for several long minutes. It's just really long with very little useful information. I want my money back."
1,BUYER BEWARE -Terrible quality and poor customer service,"I placed a phone order for 4 pashmina scarves - I emphasized my expectation of a high quality pashmina consisting of 70%cashmere and 30%silk - what I received was ""pashmina wool"" that is scratchy and not wearable. I returned all items unused, in the original packaging with all tags intact - but a 20% re-stocking charge was levied against my credit card, even though I asked about any additional charges when I placed the order! No fun..."
1,Bad Customer Service,They sent me the wrong color scarf and then expected me to pay shipping when they sent me the correct color! They also charged me a 20% resocking fee even though I returned the items within the 2 week timeframe required to avoid the charge. Some of the scarfs are very nice - depends on the color. Was planning on buying more but bad customer service has put me off.
3,Good bowl for travel or to leave in the car etc.,"As noted in other reviews, this bowl is not made of very durable materials that will last for the long haul. I keep this in our car and use it for when we're away, or at the beach. It's great to use sporadically, just not every day. I wouldn't try this in the dishwasher either...the plastic isn't thick enough. It is effective for dogs that like to dump their water out - you can hold it upside down with nearly no spillage."
1,Yes it spills...water bowl,I purchased this bowl for my very small puppy 4.2 lbs who loves to dig in her water bowl. I really thought it was going to be much smaller. It took her all of five minutes to make a huge mess. The bowl now sit on top of my refigerator. Maybe if you have a larger dog or a smaller bowl would be great.
2,somewhat disappointed,"My cat is still able to splash water from this bowl. However it does not splash so far as it did with regular bowls. Also, my cat is able to totally tip this bowl upside-down. Not good."
1,big mess.....,"I bought this for my cat who likes to play with water, food, litter, you name it. I was extremely hopeful but it took her all of 2 minutes to flip this thing over and send water flying everywhere. If you have a calm pet and this was for a car or RV or whatever, I'm sure it would be fine. But if it's for a pet like mine, then this is definitely NOT a non-spill water bowl....I'm either going to try adding velcro on the bottom of the bowl or find something heavy to put this in so she can't flip it over. Either way, it would be a lot more useful if this ""non-spill"" water bowl was weighted in some way."
2,dog dish,It was smaller and less substantial than I expected. Would be good for travel or a small dog
4,Seems to work well,"Hole is just big enough for snout of our Vizsla. Most of the spillage he does is because he drinks so much and then dribbles it out of his mouth when he is done. I use a big ceramic bowl as well, but he isn't prone to spilling that or slopping so much at the bowl. Good product, have not tried in the dishwasher yet, not sure on the plastic."
1,water water everywhere,"I bought this for my puppy who was splashing the water from her normal water bowl.She can still get at least one paw in the Water Hole and splash, then she sticks her whole head into it and wears it like a helmet.I found a ceramic bowl which the top will fit on, so she will still be able to splash some, but it is too heavy for her to push around, roll around and wear."
2,non spill water bowl,"If you have small to medium dog breeds, this is ideal..but i have a lab, & bowl doesnt hold enuf water..she still splashed water allover."
2,I must be doing something wrong,"Everyone loves this dish so I thought it would be great for my shih tzu. A few weeks ago he suddenly refused to drink out of his water bottle. A check up at the vet said his kidneys are fine so I am forced to switch to a water dish. The reviews on amazon rave about how this dish keeps a dogs beard and face dry. However, I just got it and after drinking the first time his face and beard still came up sopping wet. He is only 12 pounds so maybe this dish is just better for bigger dogs; I don't know."
5,Love this!,"I got one of these for my cocker spaniel puppy, and at first, I thought it might be a little too tall for him to reach his head up and in (he was only 6 weeks old when I got him), but he's had no trouble at all getting water. It keeps his ears out of the water, and the bowl is absolutely spill and tip proof...major plus for my rambuctious little guy. It's easy to clean too. I wish they made this in a bigger size for when he grows up!"
3,Cooking for the unadventurous,"If you don't like ""ethnic"" foods or anything spicy, this might be up your alley. Although the writer of this book is Filipino, there is only one recipe - lumpia - that isn't a popular dish from the '90's in middle America. I was off put by the fact that MSG was listed in a recipe and canned veggies are promoted over fresh. Otherwise, the book has some interesting history, but I can't help but feel that the writer of this book looks sad and overworked in most of the photos in this book."
5,The Bush Family Cookbook: Favorite Recipes and Stories from One of America's Great Families,Really a good book
5,Unintelligent & Ignorant,"That's all I have to say for those low life Dems who have no clue as to what a review is for. This is a freaking cookbook, not an opportunity to show your stupidity on what you DON'T know about the U.S. and our wonderful President. Get a clue, get a life and go exercise (for the person who blames the cookbook for gaining 40lbs in a week, what a joke!).Have you hugged a Republican today? You should and don't forget to thank us for all we have done.God Bless America"
4,"Interesting as a medical thriller, but..","Although it's a horrible story as the neonates are the victims,it's still possible when the managed care went too far.As a foreigner, I hope the American managed care system is kept under far more close observation in reality.I would rate this book 5, were it not for the unnecessary scuffle of the last 40 pages. Leave it in NYPD hands, doctors!!I wonder why the medical or forensic thriller writers including P. Cornwell, K. Reichs, want to put unnecessary, unreal fighting scenes without probability."
5,The Best!,This may be the greatest medical thriller ever written! Do not miss it! It's even better than Twinkletoe S.'s best.
4,Interesting,"I was recommended this book by a good friend, I am very glad I read it, I was very skeptical at first though because I thought medical thrillers would be diffucult for me to understand, but I found it easy to read.The plot itself was unique and I did enjoy it, but it could have been written differently.There were a lot of different situations going on that were interesting to read. Morgan Robinson and Brad Hawkins have the same suspicions about the babies that are dying in the NICU unexpectantly and they dont know why. So they start looking to find answers, what they get, as usual, goes way beyond what they thought they were getting into."
2,Shattered during the first set,"I was hoping these nylon-based sticks would have great durability, however the joint where the bristles are connected to the stick shaft is very high on the stick, and is very brittle. This joint cracked and shattered within an hour of moderate usage during a live set.I did like the solid wood design and handle grip, so I'll give it 2 stars and recommend it only for light playing. As for myself, I'll go back to using either the originalHot Rodsor Lightning Rods.Hopefully, an S-Rods 2.0 will be produced with a better design, in which case I'll likely try them again."
2,Fast delivery but wrong product,"Ordered 2 pair of Pro Mark Hot Rod drumsticks but unfortunately received 1 x Hot Rod and 1 x Lighning Rod pairs of sticks. Totally different items!!! The Lightning Rod drumsticks are useless for my purposes. In reality, this very rarely happens with items that I buy from Amazon, but, this time I really needed to be supplied with the right product. On the positive side, the delivery was AMAZING!!!!.. 5 days from date of order to delivery in Australia. Incredibly fast delivery."
3,"great sticks, but weak","i've played drums for about 16 years now, and i've used hot rods before, and love them. this time i bought them, however, one of the dowels broke and flew off after playing for under 5 minutes. pretty disappointed about that. maybe i just got a bad pair, but i do still like them, and they are great for playing quieter, maybe with an acoustic group."
4,Great for Cajon,Gives a firmer feel and sound to your playing. They work well in conjunction with a brush to cut through when needed.
1,Broke After 2nd Practice,"I was so excited to get these because of the nylon tips. I thought it would last a lot longer than the wood-tipped ones I had. Wrong! The whole end of the stick broke off after only my second practice. I duct-taped it and it lasted a little longer, but then broke several more times. My suggestion is to do some ""preemptive duct-taping"" right between the nylon tip and the wooden part when you first get it. That way it'll last you at least 4 or 5 more practices..."
4,Cool Rods,"Bought them for our small church, cuz regular sticks are to much.We love them, good product for the money"
4,helpful,"these sticks are popular with our student drummers who accompany vocal music, they give us the tone we want without too much volume, thanks!"
2,break easy,thought i was going to get a lil better product than what i received. the black rods have came out the plastic hole that it was kinda glued in. cheap materials
3,Not as great as I expected,"The stick was not as great as I expected. The brush size is too small that It doesn't provide a warm sound on the snare or tom tom. With the wooden body, it's nice that I can play crostix but overall, I do not really this product! :("
3,"The right rate 3 stars 1/2, as better things had to come ...","Well the right rate is 3 stars 1/2, as better things had to come (regarding for example of some fantastic lives like ""Live Record"", ""Never let go"" and ""Coming of Age""), nevertheless you find here an important version of ""God of light"", performed by the unforgettable Peter Bardens and an aggressive ""Lady Fantasy"" too, a great classic one!! Of course ""White rider"" is the mini-suite They have chosen from ""Mirage"", but I should have appreciated the presence of the other classics from that album, much more ... nevermind, because the last gem is alone worth buying!! The sound production is very good,if you consider the year of its issue,1972 ... besides the track ""Six ate"", from their debut album, is faithful to the original and quite progressive too, as they chose this one in the place of the other classic ""Never let go"" .. Anyway, if you are a Camel fan,you have to check this live !!"
4,It works fine if you use your noodle,"Yes, the card doesn't work with XP when you install it. It's not brain surgery; In fact, it's rather easy, and you will be up and running in no time. Also the second card isn't supposed to fit into the PCI slot the same way the other cards there do since it does not have a PCI connector! Unlike the main card it does not actually go in the PCI slot."
2,Salt Dancers was a Disappointment,"Salt Dancers was a great disappointment after Stones from the River. The story itself had pontential but I found the writing flat, lacking the depth and color of Stones.There was a certain lack of maturity in the writing, which led me to wonder if the book had been written well before Hegi's best seller. Was Salt Dancers, perhaps at the urging of agent or publisher, retrieved from the back corner of a closet to take advantage of the hype attached to Stones from the River? If so, it was a great disservice to Hegi, a truly fine writer."
2,"Boring, disappointing book","I can hardly believe this is the same writer of Stones from the River and Floating in my Mother's Palm.The story is boring (standard story about a disfunctional family survivor - what every other contemporary American book is about), and not particularly well written either.After reading a wonderfully written, profound book like Stones from the River, so deep and thought provoking, the self-absorbed navel-gazing main character of Salt Dancers is unbearable.What a let down..."
3,"Not great, not bad","I would have given up if it had been any longer. It seems that so many popular books these days are written on that old rehashed theme of ""woman abused in her childhood has to come to terms with her past"". Bleah. Nicely written though."
2,"Boring topic, forced drama","How melodramatic can you get?? One more wistful passage, and I would have put the book down. The lanquage felt forced, the character phoney and her dream sequences downright annoying. Am I really supposed to understand what her father was doing in that tree?"
5,Very authentic accounts of Maratha times,Jadunath Sarkar is one of the most authentic Indian historians.On account of his contibution to history he was knighted by the Queen. Shavaji and his times is a very interesting read of the rise of Maratha empire during Shivaji. It all also higlights what a shrewd ruler he was ( unlike most books which try to be one sided). Would definitely recommend it as a must read to anyone who is interested in Maratha history
1,Wrong example file not fixed for 2 years.,"The example of this book is from an older edition. I got the file by following the provided http address in the book. However, the years of these examples range from 2001 to 2005, but the book have the queries that seek rows with the years from 2005 to 2007. Of course, the example queries return empty sets. I had to spent 20 minutes to discover what the error was.This error is even on their ""unconfirmed"" errata list on O'reilly site. Guess when this error was reported. It was first reported in 2009! If you heard from your customer, fix the damned thing. It's amazing that the example file is still not fixed. Don't bother with this book."
3,Good Reference Book,"I didn't get the chance to read the book from start to finish, due to the lack of time, but I now use it for reference. It was very easy to use and had more details compared to some SQL Books that I tried."
2,"Only for MySQL, not for Microsoft SQL Server","Buy instead the excellent book by Ben Forta ""SQL in 10 Minutes"", which is a bit more simplistic but better.This book is geared towards an older version of MySQL, ver 4.x. Despite my best efforts, and I have several books on SQL and am not entirely a beginner, I could not entirely translate the MySQL script source code associated with this book to MS SQL Server 2005 SQL.Also, some of the ""foreign keys"" in the sample database have confusing names--a minor point but annoying.Avoid this book, unless you want to use it (as I do) as a training exercise (since I have other SQL books) rather than a book you can learn from."
2,Not fond of this book,"I found that the book could have been better. Examples were not always clearly explained, or there would be a section of code but only a couple of sentences explaining the code. It would have helped greatly in the book had explained the actual syntax, before giving an example."
5,Extremely straight and effective,"This book is great if you want to learn SQL quickly without taking the pain to scan the available tutorials from the Internet.In contrast to my preceding reviewer Mr Garland, I want to claim that for anybody bringing a little computer science and/or IT background plus a minimum of common sense, this book is of great value: it teaches SQL very straight and effective, and even motivates own experiments with the easy accessible and open source MySQL DB."
3,Muzza's Review,I think the book was ok but it needed a bit more action in it.Some parts of it were ok but others were a bit hard to understand. One good thing about this book is that itdoesn't start of slow.
4,The Car,"This book is a wonderful book. The thing that caught my eye was the title. The Car, By Gary Paulsen. I saw it in the media center and was taken by storm. I was not expecting to find a book that I would like to read, and now that I found it I am so glad that I did. I can feel what Terry Anders is going through. I know what I would do in this situation, and he has done a good job keeping his cool. I would recomend this book to anyone who is into cars and adventures, this book has the both of best worlds."
4,very god but could have been longer,"Brock BoltonMrs. RoweL.A. Block 49-29-08The CarThis book features three main characters Terry, Waylon, and Wayne, but I'm going to tell you about Waylon. Waylon is a Vietnam veteran and he is just fun loving the book mentions one time where he wins 15,000 off of poker. He is kind of old it says in his 50's. This book takes place in a lot of different places such as Cleveland, Ohio and South Dakota. Possibly my favorite part in this book is near the end when Wayne and Waylon are just like beating up cowboys crazy one after one. There is one major problem Terry is driving cross-country without a license or a legal license plate. This is resolved by Wayne getting a license plate for Terry's car. I think the theme is to learn as much as you can as live life."
3,THE CAR,The car by gary paulson there were many interesing points Terry was driving and he got in a car accidentand the car flipped off a bridge. Terry went to the hospital because he broke his arm. I will like to tell you the ending but i would recomend this book to everyone.
2,I did not like this book.,"The book, The Car, is a boring book because they drove places. This book was a boring book because they go places. but the places they went were boring. I can not relate to the book because I don't build a car everyday or drive around when I am under age. Terry met these two guys named Walyon and Walne. I learned that what you put your mind to you can do. You can do what you want to do, just like Terry who built a car by himself. I don't recommend this book for 8th graders because it is better for adults."
3,The Car should be read by older kids and adults.,I liked The Car because they travel aound the country. They had some interesting adventures. This kid builds a car. After his parents left him. Then he met an old Vietnam veteran.They went to the old person's friend's house. They have fun and the go trucking. I recommend this book to older kids and adults.
4,The Ride,"In the book The Car Gary Paulsen shows that car geeks are pretty cool. When the kid helps kick booty to be with his friends and his car, I think that is the ultimate sacrifice in this book, but you don't have to take my word for it. To find out if he (the boy) stays with friends and car you have to read the book.I thought it was amazing, spontaneous, and packed with surprises like when the boy wakes up to find the man peaking through the plastic sheet that is keeping the rain out and says something along the lines of, ""Can I join you in there, out of the rain?"" I recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure, cars, or any of Gary Paulsen's other books. You should and can buy it or get it at your local library."
4,This book was good.,"I thought it was a good read. I have to say that it was not that that great but it was worth my time. I kept on thinking that it was going to pick up but it didn't really. It was still pretty good, just not great. Happy Reading!"
2,I Pity The Wells Fan...,"... who drops 18 bucks on this, her worst album. This is one of the most awful examples of unsuitable material and arrangements being foisted on a first-rate singer that I have ever heard. What. Was. Atco. Thinking?? Even her 2oth Century Fox album was way, way better! Completists probably own the vinyl and don't need this warning; those who are just now coming under the spell of this fabulous stylist should make this their last stop on the way to acquiring her recorded output"
5,good book,i enjoyed reading this book --- good plot and it kept me reading...will try to read more by this author
2,"Get ""Absolutely The Best"" instead.","I was so disappointed at Liquid 8 Records for the careless job they did with this 10-song collection. First off, they misspelled some of the song titles. (What's ""Jungle Jangle""? What's ""Easy Girl""?) Also, the track listing doesn't match what's on the disc itself.The quality is good but it's engineered so the songs fade-out too soon. Also, in spite of using Pro Tools for the mastering, they couldn't get out those tape bumps at the start of ""Bang-Shang-A-Lang"" or ""Who's Your Baby"" that are deftly silenced on ""Absolutely The Best of The Archies"" and ""The Archies"" (On RKO Records). So pass on this one and get ""Absolutely The Best of The Archies"" instead. The quality is superb and they have 16 songs."
5,JAMIE FOXX,"GOT ALL OF THEM THAT CAME OUT AND IT WAS WORTH IT ... IF YOU NEED A GOOD LAUGH, THEN THESE AMERICA'S FUNNIEST IS THE WAY TO GO!!!!"
3,static,Something is wrong with the DVD. For some reason it skips and stops on it's own. I can't play past it. I couldn't do anything with it. I tried just fast forwarding through the part but it wouldn't allow it.
3,Good and bad,"For diamond stones DMT are held as the best of the best. I picked up this stone with that high expectation. I also knew that it would cut overly aggressive at first, so it needed a breaking in period. I used a chisel and took care to work the whole stone, stopping to spritz with water occasionally. Right off the bat I noticed several lumps and bumps that caught on the chisel and left deep gouges. After a couple of sessions at 10-15min the center had bedded in nicely, but the perimeter and several spots were still quite coarse.I called DMT for some advice at this point and was told to wash the stone and to use a waterstone to wear on it. So be forewarned you may need a secondary stone to prep your diamond stone.The stone cuts well and is bedding in. But this process is a bit absurd for nice bench stone. I think they should be bedded at the factory and ready to use upon arrival. Minus 2 stars for being a pain to get up and running."
5,Autorretrato,"I first heard this CD in Madrid in '05 and was blown away by the emotional intensity expressed by the singer. I purchased it in Salamanca a few days later and have enjoyed it since then, but be warned, it is neither easy listening nor for faint of heart. It's a great testimony to the versatilityof Camaron, but not a totally cohesive package; on the other hand, the serious music lover,will no doubt be amazed and cheer for more."
2,Do Camarones Sound Like This Dipped in Boiling Water?,"The few cuts with the Royal Philharmonic save the album from complete disaster. Nothing is good. The arrangements are unimaginative. The accompaniments add nothing positive. As for Camaron's vocals, I wouldn't listen to this again if you paid me. My dog howls better."
1,Major Disappointment,"I was expecting the original recordings. There was nothing to indicate that these were re-recordings. The track for 'Il Silenzio' was the sole reason I purchased the CD and it was nothing like I had hoped. Someone, Bear Family perhaps, will re-release 'Il Silenzio' and 'Spanish Brass'."
3,"Disappointing, mildly!",IL SILENZIO...anyone who has the original version of the title track (late '60's) will be a little weak kneed with disappointment at the NEW offer- ing! Etzel is no Tina Turner......time is catching up with him....and reaping it's toll!Chris Olsen hapynest@linc-net.net
3,Couldn't listen to it.,"Hard to review something you can't listen to. I am not deaf, but perhaps I am dumb. How do you get the CD to play? Would be nice to see a very big button marked: ""Click here to hear.""Thanx for reading."
1,I received another product not the one that I asked for,"Unfortunately, they sent me the wrong product and I don't know how to complain or send my feedback. I have a bad luck"
3,Nothing special and smells cheap,"Just very common fresh smell, lemon note. Like a rot apple. Cheap smell. Also the bottle looks cheap. Cannot understand the high rates here. Will never buy Donna Karen perfum any more."
5,smells like me,"I have been using this cologne for years. Every time I go anywhere right after putting it on, I get people telling me I smell good, and you can tell it's not just because I smell strongly. On several occasions I have had people tell me they were standing next to me because I smell good. :P"
4,Unfairly dumped-on....,"True, Andy Latimer's the only REAL Camel guy on it, but this album is unfairly dumped-on by Camel fans. The whole 2nd side is gorgeous, especially ""Sasquatch"" & ""A Heart's Desire/End Peace,"" ""Manic"" is an Xtremely angry-sounding tale of schizophrenia, & ""Camelogue"" & ""Today's Goodbye"" R at least pleasant & intresting. The 1st side's more of a problem: ""No Easy Answer"" is OK, & ""Heroes"" is nice ... but the rest IS a significant drop-off in quality from previous albums. So play the 2nd side, Njoy the guest work by Peter Bardens & Anthony Phillips, & take it 4 what it is -- perhaps not as ""progressive"" as the band's hard-core fans would like, but still real nice. I think Latimer held-up pretty well under the commercial pressure from his record company. This is as good as the earlier BREATHLESS and I CAN SEE YOUR HOUSE FROM HERE, if not as solid as SNOW GOOSE or NUDE...."
2,A moment of transition and confusion,"This was a strange time for Camel--the only real illusion this album has to being a Camel album is that Andrew Latimer is on every track. The one highlight is Sasquatch. Peter Bardens comes back to the fold to play some nice keyboards, supported by Anthony Phillips' (Genesis) twelve-string and Simon Phillips'(Jon Anderson's Animation, The Who, Mike Rutherford, etc.) amazing drum playing. I got this album mostly because Anthony and Simon were on it, and thought there would be more great moments. The official Camel web site talks about how fun this album was to make, and that energy does come through. I just wish some more good music would have come out of it. Camel is a great band, with their first 5 albums being extreme classics. This album is mostly for someone wanting the entire Camel catalogue."
2,A commercial compromise,Sadly this excellent band had to make some concessions to the powers-that-be of the record industry. Because of that this album and the following -and better- Stationary Traveller were released.Particularly this one was named The Single Factor ironically honouring the whim the record company had to achieve that single FM-hit song which could raise some money.Just forget this poor work. No band is perfect.
4,Very helpful for anyone studying Qualitative Analysis.,This book is a must for grad students with Qualitative Analysis as a vision for their dissertation.
4,Christian Jacq ends this series with a great book,"I have enjoyed the Stone of Light books for many years now and am sad to see this series come to an end. However, I think that the Place of Truth was a wonderful end to this great series.Christian Jacq had created a great mystery in the past tree books. I picked up each book and read it with eagerness trying to figure out who the traitor was inside the brotherhood. Well this time he keeps you waiting until almost the last page, keeping the suspense there right up until the end.This book has all of the things that I look for in a Christian Jacq book, good character interaction, so action, and a great story.All in all this was a fitting end to a great series of books. I would highly recommend reading this entire series."
4,affordable,i got what paid for a at a decent price. my knifes fit in just great.i look forward to bringing my knifes and tools all together in this wonderful knife roll.
3,Seems fine,"I bought this knife roll as a Christmas present for my wife. I don't believe she's used it, but upon inspection, it seems fine."
4,Excellent reference for TA tools,"This book will give you the basics of almost all popular TA tools around. It's strength is that it will allow you to understand how the different TA tools work. One mistake many street traders make is to use several TA indicators that build on a formula including the same basic numbers. Without being able to ""look inside"" the workings of the different TA tools it is not possible to safely combine several TA tools to get a better TA picture of the market dynamics (if you believe in TA at all). As a reference I have not seen any better. However, what I would like to see was someone try to systematically group together TA tools that ""fit"" to each others."
1,"Missing the ""good stuff""","Although this book is complete in its listing and description of MANY market indicators, it has only done what anyone can do, regardless of their technical expertise. What it does NOT do is explain how to use technical indicators in conjuction with each other to reach real decision-making success. Frankly, I have yet to find a book that does this. I think the writers are really missing the boat, or they just don't have the Know-how to pull this valuable feat off."
2,Ok book,I wouldnt recommend this book because I do not think it will improve your performance of trading stocks.This book tells all the basic explanations of indicators (and how to apply.)Thank youNORI
4,"good reference, not much more","This makes a great reference if you want to know what x indicator is, and how it is typically interpreted. The book is often good on giving you general information on how it's calculated, but not always. I'd certainly recommend it as a reference, but don't expect to get a lot of useful actionable items from the book, it's just a reference."
2,Shallow reference,"The book provides limited descriptions of most techncial indicators used in trading. There is very little about how they might be used or how they are calculated - here is a typical comment: ""The Accumulation Swing Index is a cumulative total of the Swing Index. The Swing Index and the Accumulation Swing Index require opening prices.Step-by-step instructions on calculating the Swing Index are provided in Wilder's book, New Concepts In Technical Trading Systems."".As the book is available for free at Metastock's web site and as most of the indicators are covered much better for free around the web, its not really worth buying the book."
4,Good Reference!,"This book is a really good reference for the beginners and provides important and valuable information; However it does not go into details as much as I expected. If you are a math person as I am and really seek the logic behind every aspect you read, this book will not satisfy you since much of the calculations are referred as they are behind the scope of the book. I would suggest you to buy this book and keep it as a reference anyhow."
2,poor quality. Pages garbled,"Several of the chapters' first pages were garbled. I finally figured out to read every other line to have it make sense. Sometimes the pages were out of order. When I found something that didn't make sense, I skipped ahead to find where it did and then backed up and read the skipped pages."
2,Not a big fan,You shouldn't need a wrench like this anyways (filters should always be hand tightened) and this particular model is more difficult to use due to the metal strap. A solid rubber strap would be much more friendly to the filter though obviously alot messier in the event you spill oil on it.
3,Not pretending to be an art movie,"...and it is not. Clean shots of what is going on in a Zen monastery. It tends to be repetitive which I guess is alright as a parallel to the monastic life of these nuns.It feels like a home made movie shot without much detail.Indoor shots are at very bright artificial light. Feels like the people shooting it were in a hurry to get it done and get out of there.But then, this is just my opinion..."
1,Misleading,"This is a misleading DVD because the title leads one to think one will gain insight into zen buddhism. Obviously the title was a marketing ploy. I guess they knew that if they gave a title that was ""real"" people wouldn't buy this. A ""real"" title would be: ""silent, unenlightening montage of video of korean buddhist nuns"". There is no narration or explanation of zen buddhism, simply video montage of korean buddhist nuns undergoing a 90 day meditation. Very cheap documentary and highly misleading. unless you want to watch two hours of korean nuns meditating, avoid this like the plague."
1,Disappointed,"I have watched many documentaries on Buddhism, and I have enjoyed most of them except this one. The cinematography was terrible as if the person holding the camera was clueless. At least if it was shot beautifully then I could at least have a relaxing time watching it.There seemed to be no point to this documentary, and there was nothing to be learned. The short interviews with the nuns were superficial in content, and this is the only Buddhist documentary I have seen that made Buddhism seem stupid. I am a Buddhist so I have a lot of love for the religion, but I think if I was forced to watch this video a second time I may quit being a Buddhist."

5,A Great Album Made Even Better,"This is still one of my all-time favourite albums in this genre...CSN (and sometimes Y) have produced a vast body of work over the years, some of it good, some great and some better off left in the vault. I especially enjoy hearing outtakes and demos, the four chosen here are superb, albeit the tip of the iceberg. It would be so nice if they did a really extensive archival box set as there are dozens of cool things lurking in limbo....time will tell, but don't hesitate to pick this up if you are a fan of this stuff."
5,Outstanding Reissue Of Exceptional Debut From Three Great Singer/Songwriter/Human Beings,"This CD is an outstanding reissue of an exceptional debut from three great singer/songwriters. There are many great songs here, including ""Suite: Judy Blue Eyes"", ""You Don't Have To Cry"", ""Pre-Road Downs"", ""Wooden Ships"", ""Helplessly Hoping"", ""Long Time Gone"", and ""49 Bye-Byes."" The fact that CSN (and Y) all believe that the young Australian tourist jailed in Indonesia since 2005 for drug-smuggling was unjustly convicted makes this expanded reissue, as well as any other CSN/CSNY CD (except LIVE IT UP) an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience."
2,Not Worth Added Cost over Standard CD,The music is classic. This review pertains to the quality only. I purchased this new and the title side appeared to be deteriorating. The play side had some defects but did play. I have higher-end equipment and really couldn't tell that much difference between the standard CD and the gold (I owned both).
2,Don't buy,"I'm sure glad I didn't give away my first CD of this album. I'm not a critical listener but the top end of the sound has been dulled very badly. The bonus material is OK but doesn't fit with this album, it's more like from Deja Vu. I hope nothing ever happens to my unremastered disc. P.S. I gave this disc away."
1,"Crosby, Stills & Nash","The sound is NOT an improvement. Stick with your older copy and save your money. Can not listen to this CD, it is just that bad. Tried to import into iTunes but the sound was just that bad."
2,"LONGARM IN CALIFORNIA, WHEN HE GETS THERE!","Quite a bit of book taken up with non-essential stuff, filler, much of the first third of book on one train or another. This slow moving Giant book from August, 1992. is an 'ok' read but just that, 'ok'.Didn't really care for the book as much as the regular, monthly numbered Longarm editions. Might be the one and only Giant edition I will read. Have read Giant, expanded editions in The Trailsman and The GUNSMITH series and they were very good. Not this one, unfortunately. Slow and dragging.See you soon, Amigos. (as good the Cisco Kid would say)"
1,If you believe in the Bible dont get this one.,I have never read a Bible that believes in evolution before. This bibles has questions and answers in the front that catholics should'nt believe. Take away the first 125 pages I might have given this version a few more stars.
4,Buy the later edition instead,The 5th edition paperback is available from Amazon underMystery Train: Images of America in Rock 'n' Roll Music: Fifth Edition.
4,fairly reliable parts from Fel-Pro,"I've installed this part before, and maybe I messed up, because 5 years later, the oil pan is leaking again.I do have a complaint about how Amazon is doing things. I got an opened box, and the wedge seal was missing. I had to buy one locally to complete my install.If Amazon is shipping out returned items, they should at least make sure that they are complete."
1,use a shoe box instead,I got this wardrobe for Christmas. The metal latch broke the first time I used it. It was pretty lame. Use a shoe box for your groovy girl stuff instead.
3,where are the legends,"coro is the hottest thing in the freestyle world but where re the other legends ? judy torrez , george lamond , cynthia , and my other favorite besides coro-- raiana paige !"
5,Love it!,Great item and still use them to this day. I just bought a washable filter and replaced it for those expensive $20 filters. Once a month I wash the filter and clean it real good and they still work..Have had these for about 4 years now. Definitely would buy again. Great price!
4,Transitional beeping alarm clock,"Ordered it because I wanted an alarm that starts out quietly. It's a very nice little clock. I like that it lights up when you touch it, but I wish it started out beeping more quietly than it does."
1,Holtz can coach...Holtz can't write,"I love Notre Dame football and am a huge fan of Lou Holtz. But this account of the Irish's championship run is excruciatingly dry to the point of frustrating. Lou's quoted many times saying ""...he'll be a fine player..."" ugh! Passion and wit were lacking throughout the book. If you want prose above a fifth grade level, save your money."
5,A Genius Is Born,"Juvenal, Chaucer, Rabelais, Swift ... Glazov. Although many are dissatisfied with the quality of literature at the end of the twentieth century, Glazov's stirring masterpiece is proof that genius still lives and thrives in North American culture. I have not been this moved since I read King Lear for the first time. Glazov has a vast and penetrating mind and his art delves deep into the collective subconscious of our intellectual milieu, if not into the very spiritual core of our society. I believe that this work will not merely be a jewel among the rough, but will spur a whole new generation of writers and poets in the English speaking world. A staggering accomplishment, that may bring about as much cataclysmic change to our understanding of the world as did Darwin's Origin of Species."
1,Craven idiocy,"How courageous, writing a book criticing a chimerical ""left"", without any sustained or rigorous argument and relying on a bundle of familiar stereotypes unworthy of serious consideration. What masochistic impulse leads Glazov et al to be paid sevants of the status quo? To be read only by those unimaginative and unintelligent enough to think that society as it is is basically as good as it gets."
4,A cunning satire,"I came across Jamie Glazov's booklet almost by accident, through a friend of mine from College. Reading Glazov's work was a total joy and I found that he was able to articulate much of the frustration I have felt in my dealings with the radical left. Glazov uses humour as a most effective means of expressing his argument with the left. My only criticism is that, at times, it seems as though Glazov is unable to control his apparent hatred for these people and, consequently his satire becomes almost too vicious. On the whole, however, 15 Tips on how to be a Good Leftist is a gem and deserves much more attention that it has hitherto received."
4,A Fun Book For Children,"The book ""Snowie Rolie"" by William Joyce is a very creative book for children. It sets there imagination off. The set is very aesthetic setting with cute characters. The rhyming and fun use of words, I think, captures the childrens attention and makes them like the book even more. I didnt have Rolie Polie Olie as a kid but my niece loves it. I think its a wonderful book for children."
1,Disappointed,"Again - We love the book titled ""rolie olie polie"" but the two books I purchased are not rhyming books and quite frankly not that great - we are disappointed!"
4,Help Mr. Snowie!,If you have a kid that is 5 or 6 this is the book for him or her.They would like how the sun burns out and if your child has an imagination then its perfect. I liked it because it proves that the author has a really good imagination.
2,Could be better,"The illustrations in this book are beautiful, but the story is not very good. The ""story"" seems like it was written simply to figure out a way to include illustrations of snowmen and a Santa figure. It lacks the rhyming and cadence found in the original Rolie Polie Olie book and Sleepy Time Olie. If you're looking for a book about the wonder of winter, this is not it."
5,Kept me up late reading!,"I couldn't seem to stop reading even though it was very late. When my eyes wouldn't cooperate, I grabbed a few hours of sleep, but first thing in the morning I picked up the book and read until I finished it. The story was fast-paced, and the characters believable. I enjoyed the format, and would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes a good read."
5,Hands down and excellent album!,"Warrant is the most underated band of the so-called ""Hair bands"" or ""Soft metal"". Warrant is beyond that, actually, Jani Lane is far beyond that. He's a great songwriter and singer, and the rest of the band are equally great musicians.Their first 2 albums are not this great, not because of lack of talent but lack of production or time or just will to make them better, BUT they are not bad at all, and they represent what we all wanted to listen to back then.Belly to Belly is a great album, lyrics are so honest and transparent, beautiful songs, great arrangements, clean and powerful sound, AWESOME drummer, and the cherry on top, Jani's voice.If you like(d) warrant because of the pretty faces, the party-like lyrics and ""soft-rock"" sound, in other words, if you were just a poser, don't buy it, it's too much for your ears.If, on the other hand, you like good and powerful rock, go ahead and buy it, you won't regret any penny."
2,It sucks!!,"Warrant was my first favorite band when I started to listen to rock music. I loved all the Warrant records, Cherry Pie, DRFSR, Dog Eat Dog and Ultraphobic. I thought Belly to Belly was going to be a great secuel of Ultraphobic, but i was so dissapointed when I give it the first listen. It was so strange, weird and disgusting to my ears. I admire Jani Lane for trying to seek for new sounds and try to match with the 90's garbage music. But this was horrible! It's so sad that this was the last Warrant record of original material with Jani. I just hate this sound, hate the lyrics, hate the songs. This has nothing to do with Warrant, so If you're a fan and you really want to have this, buy it, but you won't find the Warrant sound here."
2,"Tries to hard to ""fit in"".....","Two stars seems harsh, but this is not a good Warrant album. It does have its merits and is a good attempt to capture the sound that was popular at the time. I did like the song AYM. I'm not sure why others hate it so much. They continue in the direction that 'Ultraphobic' started in and went further. If you have not heard this album before it is worlds apart from 'Dog Eat Dog' and 'DRFSR' sounds. If you like Warrant and want variety in their music then this should be a good purchase. It would have been better had they included a couple rockers in the mix to keep all parties happy. They experimented with their sound, but I am glad they came back to familiar territory with their latest effort 'Born Again'."
2,What happened?!?!?!?,"This is a huge disappointment after the release of what I consider Warrants best work (Ultraphobic). What we have here are a bunch of two minute sings that don't even sound like Jani Lane. I know this guy has the talent and hope he will show it again someday. Take control Jani, you ARE Warrant!"
2,No flow to the music,"I bought this album without hearing any of it first (this was before I had internet access). I'd heard the classic Warrant songs (Heaven, Sometimes She Cries, Cherry Pie, etc.) and figured this album may revive glam rock or at least bring back some memories of my youth. I started listening to it, and I was like, ""uh...what?"" The music was kind of like alternative, without the grunge edge, mixed together with an attempt at introspective psychedelic rock. The music sounded forced and it didn't flow well at all! Jani Lane had some good intentions on this album, but the execution was horrible!"
1,Disgusting.,"If you liked ""Dog Eat Dog"", which was an excellent rock music album, you must avoid this disc at all costs. End of discussion."
1,Not worth the time,"The first track on this album is ""In The End (There's Nothing)."" Very appropriate, as this is probably the end of Warrant and it's pretty much nothing. Too bad Amazon's rating system doesn't go below one star."
1,Not Even Worth One Star,"Where do I start with this album? this has got to be the worst album I've ever heard (& I've heard Mr Blobby).I got this one after ""Dog Eat Dog"", being as I live in England anything after ""Cherry Pie"" is Evil to get hold of, so it came in the post, the whole ""Warrant '96"" & ""Volume 1"" had intreged me, stuck it straight in the sterio expecting to hear something good, instead I just heard this drone, I know the music industry was crap in 1996 but thats no excuse for this.Interlude #1 & 2 are a complete waste of time, its like a 5 second track. Warrant music have been completely wasted to let this slip thru.I'd say stay away from it but if you're a die hard Warrant fan get it to look pretty in your collection but dont play it."
4,Cushion Quality,I ordered this to go along with the teak lounge chair and both of them turned out to be a great deal. Only took one day to Arizona and so far no color change from the every day sun.
4,Right battery for the right job,After Hurricane Sandy we bought a generator and found out we needed a battery. Everyone I spoke to recommended this brand - after some additional research we decided this was the right one. It installed easily and is working perfectly.
2,Didn't really like,"This is the love story of Corey and Trevor. Corey is Trevor's son teacher. At first Corey thinks Trevor is a bad father, since he had been out of the child's life. I liked the part's where Trevor spent with his son and his nephrew, but I didn't care for Trevor and Corey's relationship, I felt that it didn't consist of anything but sleeping together."
3,Love Lessons,This story was very good in the beginning but it started to get tiresome in the end. I am glad that Trevor owned up to his responsibiliites to his son. I really love the fact that Trevor and Corey finally got together.
2,Didn't Enjoy This Book,"I really didn't enjoy this book. The only things I really liked about this book were the sexual chemistry between the characters and that the little boy was adorable. With that exception, I found the story and the relationship lacking. She also used what I believe was Jamaican dialect through too much of the book, too often, and it lost me. Using the dialect made it hard to follow, those parts could have been key in drawing me into the book, but it didn't. Lastly, Ms. Esdaile makes attempts to make the characters more ""hip"" by using slang, which she has done in other novels too, and it just didn't work for me. This book may work for some, but it just doesn't for me.This was my second or third attempt at reading Ms. Esdaile and I finally gave her up after reading this book, which is a shame since she sets most of her books in Philadelphia and it's always nice to read stories set in towns I'm familiar with."
4,A classic!!!,"I have read this book many, many times in the past 20 years. It speaks to the longings within the heart of the believer who desires to know his God more. It is written by an author who has the credibility to write the book. He obviously knows what it is like to experience a meaningful fellowship with God. That fact gives power to each sentence in this classic work. It's a must read!Matt EllisBrooksville, Florida"
4,"Wonderful book, poor printing","""The Pursuit of God"" is a modern Christian classic that makes clear how far modern Christianity has strayed from the primacy of our personal relationship with God. Every Christian should read this book and pray the prayers at the end of each chapter. That being said, I would not buy the edition published by Wilder Publications in 2008 (ISBN 1-60459-319-9) because it is full of typographical errors. (Actually, the errors look like they could have been caused by poor optical scanning software.)"
5,Great analysis of a universal pursuit,"Being the first of his books that I have read, I was particularly impressed with the accessibility of Tozer's insights."
4,Great book.,Anything A. W. Tozer writes is a treasure and this is no exception. it makes a great gift for those searching for greater knowledge of God.
5,Best free book on Amazon.,"I nominate this book as the all time best free book on Amazon. Concise, passionate, thoughtful, compelling. And somehow Toser manages to come off as both intelligent and eloquent yet frank and personal. A fantastically good read. The past half century has done little to diminish the great urgency of this book."
5,Realigning faith,"An impacting book to realign new as well as mature believers in the good news . A classic must read, always a reverent and appropriate theology."
5,"Concise, powerful, best bang for the buck","Concise, powerful, best bang for the buck Concise, powerful, best bang for the buck Concise, powerful, best bang for the buck"
5,honest commentary,"I was very pleasantly surprised by the honest insight of this book.It goes into the truth of religious faith without sugarcoating, or bending itself to denominational viewpoints. The writing style, and vocabulary can be a slight bit heady or archaiac at times, but this book is definitely a must read for any that are seeking a dynamic faith, and more rational knowlege of God."
1,Don't buy this edition of the book.,"The Pursuit of God is a favorite book of mine, and I recently ordered two copies of this edition. It never occurred to me that anybody would publish such a poor quality edition of such a wonderful book. It is as though someone read the book out loud into a computer program and then never proofread the result. In the FIRST CHAPTER ALONE I counted at least NINETEEN errors...spelling, grammar, and margin alignment errors that were so glaring as to totally distract from the message of the book. This book was intended to give glory to God by bringing people to a deeper knowledge of Him, but this particular edition dishonors Him by its poor quality. I had ordered these books to be gifts, but I had to go back and order different editions from different vendors. I highly recommend that Amazon remove this edition from sale on their website."
5,Lifechanging,"A.W. Tozer's book, The Pursuit of God, was used by God to change my whole perspective on life from the time I was a teenager. Since then I have given away many copies. If you long to know God, or even you simply have the vague longing for ""something more"", this book will feed your soul. It will point you toward the purpose for which you were created, and show you how to follow on."
5,Awe - inspiring,"The book brings you into a closer relationship with the Lord. It teaches you how to draw near to God, how to become more sensitive to the Holy Spirit in your life. I would compare it to spending $3.00 on a lottery ticket and finding that you won the lottery. Great investment if you read it."
5,Powerful,It was by God's choice I read this at the same time I'm studying another book that was very close to the same subject. This an excellent book. I would recommend this book highly to any one wanting to know God more.
4,Thought provoking,"One of the best books I've ever read...of any genre! There are many ""devotional"" style books out there, but very few come close to this in either writing style, but more importantly in content. A life-changing book for anyone who has a desire to get to know God better. I highly recommend. Short chapters with different topics and a prayer at the end of each chapter. Very thought provoking."
1,Bad version,"Don't buy yhis version, it is missing the TOC. Spend the extra buck for the other version"
2,Great book; wrong edition,"The Pursuit of God by A.W. Tozer is one of the best books written on our relationship with God. However, this particular edition is very hard to read because the print is so small. I would rather pay more for larger print."
3,"Awesome book, sloppy edition","THIS IS A GREAT WORK, BUY IT AND READ IT. But this edition has so many typographical errors it's shocking. Did anyone proofread this thing?"
5,Best Devotional Book,In my opinion this is the best devotional book I have ever read. A lot of devotional books are the product of the author's mind and not very Biblical. This is an exception. I believe this is a very Biblically accurate book. Every time I read a chapter it inspires me.Tell me what you think of my Christain fiction novel The Palace Theatre.The Palace Theatre
5,Great book,I really believe we are in need of revival in our country. Pursuing God IS the right thing to do. We need to remember just who God is... HE IS GOD!I highly recommend this book to all.
5,Recomended,"Good book, the prayers at the end of the chapters are fantastic.I would highly recommend The Practice of the Presence of God by Brother Lawrence also."
4,The pursuit of God,An excellent book. We used this for a Sunday School Class. It made a great study topic. The language is written in a very high intellectual level and occasionally requires a re-read to understand what he is saying but as you get used to his writing style it becomes easier to understand.
5,exellent book .,good easy reading with much truth really makes you think and search your heart Tozier had a real love for out Lord .
1,"Awesome Book, Horrible Editing","I love this classic by Tozer. In fact, I ordered this book to replace my well worn copy. Unfortunately, while reading the first chapter I encountered six typographical errors. These errors are the result of very shoddy editing.For instance, on page 13, Thee is spelled TThee. On page 17 it's T Thee.Also, one sentence on page 13 reads ""That is the heavenly birth without which we cannon: see the Kingdom of God.""Page 16 reads ""Lift up thine heart unto Gel...""Very shoddy work by this publisher, trashing a great classic.I highly recommend you purchase this wonderful work by A. W. Tozer, but buy it from a different publisher. I've already printed my return labels and will be sending this one back to Amazon. I'll reorder from a different publisher."
1,This Version--Terrible Edition,"The book is amazing and should be read by believers in Jesus, as well as people who ""just go to church."" This edition, however, is edited badly and unreadable at times. :( I've only gotten through the introduction."
4,The Pursuit of God,"WOW! What food for thought. At least I have a better understanding of where to go from here. Look out world, here I come!"
4,Practical goodness.,I may not agree with Tozer on all matters of theology but he certainly knows piety and how to teach it. Truly this is a saint who has blessed my life in ways that I do know. I would urge any young Christian to read this book for a good basis for how to live a life of pursuing God.
3,New Perspective,I really like the part where the author talks about how you don't have to be at church or it has to be a holiday to love God and hold him in an exalted status. You can do that everyday and in different ways.
2,Not so good,"This is like a lot of ideas put together without specific order. I cannot see the main idea (s) contained in each chapter. Instead, the author writes about different things without a unifying topic. In addition, the quoting of ""saints"" and ""The Shorter Catechism"" instead of quoting from the Bible did not offered me enough biblical foundation."
5,Great words to get our focus back,Tozer takes away the religious aspects of what we do and shows us how to center on God completely. Great words to help us remove the unnecessary in our lives.
5,Stimulated reading,Excellent book by a wonderful author! Also got The Pursuit of Man. Should be read together and with a Bible for reference.
5,An Oldie but Goodie,"I recently re-read this book for my third time with my small group. I was reluctant since I had previously read it before. It still grabbed a hold of me and challenged me to the core. This past reading I came across Tozer's ordination prayer. It blew me away. I typed out a copy of it and posted it on the wall above my desk. Great stuff!I gave this book five stars because its proven the test of time, has something for everyone, is challenging and encouraging, and as Franz Kafka would say, this book is able to...""Wake us up with a blow to the head.""This text would be a great read for personal devotions or as a group study. Some newer versions have a companion study guide which includes some historical background, chapter summations, and discussion guides."
3,My Thoughts,A. W. Tozer is a wonderful author. He has a way of writing that keeps a person interested in reading.
5,Great book!,This book does not contain theories but shows the writer's deep relationship with the Lord. I was so much blessed that I decided to buy a copy for my friend too.
1,Poor,"Hate this guy. It always seems with Tozer that its a love or hate relationship, and I just don't like him. To each his own..."
4,Live Your Faith,"An interesting read - and far less about theology than living faith - Tozer challenges the reader to understand and seek God in all aspects of life. Using both practical and profound, as well as leaning on luminaries as diverse as Thomas a Kempis and Martin Luther, Tozer challenges the reader to engage faith through a seeking of God - both imminent and transcendant. Looking to the mystical more than the theological, Tozer appears to open the door to experience God in a way that is personal and as an active component of a life to be lived - not as a legalistic or overly moralistic overlay to life. His cautions against fundamentalism of any type rang true to this reader, and his inclusionary language and open invitation to a life of living faith on a personal level were welcome and unexpected. A thought provoking classic."
5,In Pursuit of GOD,This book is most inspiring. Just what I needed to jumpstart a certain area in my Christian walk. This book was recommended to me by a close friend and I found it to be a book written by a highly anointed author.
3,Good,i bought this book for my incarcarated friend he wanted some books to read i was glad i could find a reasonable price for them. It was shipped directly to him without a problem.
5,A Devotional Classic,"I first read this book 30 years ago as a teenager (giving my age away) and new Christian. It shaped my image of God then, and still does. Tozer writes with a mind on fire for God, with a passion and brilliance rare in combination. ""The Pursuit of God"" entices to God because it biblically portrays God.Reviewer: Dr. Robert W. Kellemen, Ph.D., is the author of ""Soul Physicians"" and ""Spiritual Friends."""
3,"This Vol IV has very rare patterns, should be noted","The earlier volumes have the more common patterns, title should reflect this. I, like others, have never seen more than a couple of these pieces. A good book otherwise, though would have liked to know which items are available in each pattern instead of just the number of items in each. It is difficult to determine if you would like to collect a certain pattern otherwise. Book seems to hint that more information is known, but just not included. In nearly all cases, the pictures are excellent. Index includes previous volumes, a great help."
1,Disappointment,"Gene Florence has let true glass collectors down with this book. With so many etch patterns to identify, he chooses instead to cover more obscure things like Cathay Crystal. I did not solve one glass mystery with this book and wish I had saved my money. Also, again, he chose to completely ignore Maryland Glass. Although a fan, I cannot let this one slide. Save your money and don't bother with this one."
4,A Book to Consider,"This volume has wonderful photos, 3 per page x 179 pages. Of the 4 pieces I was trying to ID none of them showed up. To be fair they did not show up in the other 3 books that I have. There wasn't any suggested values which was a minor disapointment. I am not an expert and this book will be helpful but not as helpful as I had hoped it would be."
2,Florence's Glassware Pattern Identification Guide,"Names all the colors the pieces come in, who manufactured them and the dates, but failed to tell what the pieces were/are used for."
3,Learning Depression Glass,"For a collector, this book lacks many of the patterns, needed to know, in pricing a product. Some of the patterns pictured are not defined enough. Amagnifying glass may be needed for a closer look. For beginners, it is a respected book, written by two experts."
4,Soothing,This CD puts me in such a great space when I listen. It's very relaxing & helps me to wind down.
3,Cannot recommend: 800mAH not as good as 850mAH battery,"When I purchased this battery, I thought that based on the price, I was getting a quality battery versus the cheaper white generic battery.But what really makes a difference is what is under the hood of a battery.In this case, this battery is identical to the white battery in that both are rated 800mAH.I have switched to a battery with an 850mAH rating versus 800mAH rating, and I see a difference in fewer dropped calls and better call quality. Granted, the battery life is about the same on both, but while the battery lasts, at least with the 850mAH rated battery, I am getting better call quality.I now only purchase 850mAH rated batteries as they have made a difference in my cordless phones in my home."
5,Awesome,"These girls are hot, there vocals are hot, every song has a story, they bring every emotion in each song. Great guitar sounds. Wish they had more than 2 Cd's.""She's only twenty but it won't take long, she's left her family and she's left home, Can't you help her, Can't you help her."""
3,Canned Heat Live,"Not as good as some of their other live performances. When are they going to release an album of their Woodstock performance as Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Johnny Winter, Sly and the Family Stone, Jefferson Airplane, and Santana have done?"
5,Great wireless connection. Always strrong signal,Great wireless connection. Would recommend. Never lose a signal. I have three in the house and if needed another would get the same kind.
1,no big deal,"save your money!!!!!!!it will put you asleep.jim the shofar man wrote a dud of a book on the shofar.it mostly talks about how people react to the shofar when he play it.the book is more about braging then anything else.i just glad i got this book free when i bought a shofar from him years ago.his shofars are great,but the book isn't.GOD BLESS"
2,Ministry of the Shofar booklet,"I thought I was purchasing a book for my mother, but it is only a small booklet on how the shofar is a blessing to others. I was disappointed that it wasn't what I was looking for, but it is interesting."
4,Pure Rock 'N' Roll,"Motorhead never fails to provide a pure enjoyable head banging experience, and overnight sensation does just that. Great album, highly recommended if you are a Motorhead fan!"
4,Lemmy's mastery comes again,This is an album that i loved as soon as I put it in. The riffs stay in my head for days. Its simple and to the point. It sticks to the motorhead formula of hard and fast and rates as one of my favorite albums.
4,Motorhead - 'Overnight Sensation' (CMC International),"Good worthy follow-up to their 'Sacrifice' effort. Some fans say this CD is Motorhead's most diverse work in years.Still a great catalog title from Lemmy and crew,that's a true keeper.Well,to MOST Motorhead fans it is.Tracks that I thought made the grade were the metal gems,""Civil War"",""Eat The Gun"",the humorous ""Crazy Like A Fox"" and the steady rocker ""Shake The World"". Also liked ""Love Can't Buy You Money"". It's just that I've got SO much Motorhead and I still don't have every one of their releases. Maybe half of their repertoire. Still churning out that must-have British heavy metal after all these years."
4,A good album,"I love Motorhead . Its one of my favorite bands . Especially Ace of Spades and Overkill are masterpieces. Well this album is not so good as their previous but is good. Its aggressive and there is passion in the music. I Lemmy was a little bit younger then he would have sound much better. If you are a Motorhead fan you will probably like this album, but if you expect another Ace of Spades -> well it is not. Made your choice"
5,The Ultimate JD book!,"Great book, wonderful pictures. I could thumb through this all night and look at the pictures and marvel at the fabulous craftsmanship of these magnificent machines!"
4,very useful,h there have bought ths product one mount before and can say about that very good and very useful f u nterested about nerve moblzaton you should buy one
3,A good book for starters,"This book is the most recently (2004) published directory on air and space museums of the USA and Canada. The title of the book is misleading, there are only about 300 air museums in North America that have aircraft, not 900! The author has done a fair job of presenting details about the museums. The main problem is that much of the info is well out of date or is in error. The book needs to be seriously revised. If you have a recent previous edition, you may want to pass this edition up."
5,Atypical Can but Outstanding Never the Less,"Malcolm Mooney reunites with the band and puts up eight GREAT songs. The sounds are jazzy, poppy, polished, upbeat and raw. The songs are more structured than typical Can but the record is like a breath of fresh air. Highly recommend this one whether you're a Can fan or not."
3,Average,"This is an average performance that has nothing special to say. Having in shelf so great readings of thissymphony, this is not a recommendable option, even for beginners. Absolutely dispensable."
1,Health Food for Cats?,"I only bought this because the breeder where I bought my cat said she wouldn't eat anything else. I'm surprised my cat didn't starve to death, because she wouldn't touch this stuff, nor would my other cat. I donated it to the Humane Society."
1,Some things are just funnier when you hear them.,"Mel Brooks and Carl Reiner have collected many of this character's ""greatest hits"" and put them in book form. Buy the audio tape. This is just one of those examples of a performance that doesn't translate well to the written word. Brooks and Reiner are very funny men but this is not a funny book. Trying to imagine inflection and timing is not a fun thing while you're trying to read."
4,The book is hilarious and probably good therapy.,"Mel Brooks and Carl Reiner have actually lived a long time, and it shows through in this book in a most positive light. The humor is edgy and street-wise without being totally cynical and self-pitying. They follow in the worthy footprints of Harry Golden and Sam Levenson who could generate adult humor without being embarassing. I would say to most of the people I know: Are you getting older and inwardly a little scared of that? Are you ever crying on the inside while you're laughing on the outside? Congratulations -- you're a bone fide member of the human race! You would like this book. (Bonus: It can be read in one sitting, but I would recommend keeping it handy for re-reading.)"
3,Good but not up to par with 2013 year-old man,"I've already ""listened"" to this work four times in the past week. Having acquired the CD collection of all four previous efforts, the latest being created in 1973 (The 2013 year old man), I was thrilled when I read in a recent magazine article of this latest release. There are several very humorous ""skits"" in this publication. They did surprise me with the repetitive use of the infamous four letter word as the basis of one of the stories. A definite, worthwhile acquisition for those of us who admire the works of Carl Reiner and Mel Brooks but after a 24 year hiatus, I was expecting better."
2,Very disappointing,A few laughs but not worth the money. Wish I'd gone to the Library first to read it.
3,Some what funny,A fan of both Mel Brooks and Carl Reiner I was a little disappointed in the book. It's a quick read. Interested? Go to your local library. I took mine of the Express Shelf (7-days loan.) and could have returned it the same afternoon. Unless you collect Brooks-Reiner books save your $$$.
3,Short & sweet,"Yeah, It is a short read. Yeah, I bought it for US$2.50 equivalent. Yeah it is a lot of rehash.It is still real funny. Funnier if you have a knowledge of history, the Bible and ancient comedy."
2,"This is a pamphlet, not a book.","In the hour that it took to read this tiny tome ... more a transcript of a recording session than a literary effort, I was highly amused by a number of the observations. Less amusing was the reuse of old material, both cited and not.Carl, Mel, your mothers would be ashamed. Not worth the money, particularly since there will probably be a TV special containing all the material sometime before the millenium."
1,Yuck!,I Paid a little less than 2 dollars for this book at a discount book store and that is just about what it is worth! Some of the jokes aren't funny ! I whited out all the inappropriate references which where unfunny and frequent! Don't buy this book unless you prefer filthy and unfunny humor books! Mel brooks and Carl reiner can be very funny when they get there mind out of the gutter. That is why I bought this book! I wish I hadn't
4,Missing track,"The performance and sound on this DVD-A are great, but the album notes list a bonus track as no. 6: ""Alison's Uncle,"" which just isn't on the recording, on either side. They must have copied the notes from some other edition.The piano sounds a bit muffled--but I think it's probably just an inferior piano rather than a recording problem. And the stereo separation is extreme as in a lot of early stereo recordings: drums and bass firmly on the right, trumpet and sax firmly on the left, piano in the middle. Probably an accurate rendering of the original release, but not what you would have heard in person."
2,Projects for unimaginative kitchen cabinets,"Projects in book are just not good enough for custom build kitchen cabinets. These types of cabinets come as standard package in even non-expensive houses. Basically, this book presents anatomy of standard, out of mill, unimaginative kitchen cabinets."
2,Basic building guide to ugly cabinets,"As many others have said before this is really just an overview of how to build cabinets, and ugly ones at that. He goes over a lot of the dimensions and some of the techniques involved in making the cabinets but honestly I kind of feel like this book was made by ""Tim the Toolman Taylor"" a regular handyman just sharing some of his thoughts on building a cabinet, he does not appear to be a pro in any way, and his techniques are fairly primitive even in this newer second edition. If you really want to read something written by a pro, and with much better techniques (and results) I'd suggest you buy Building Kitchen Cabinets by Udo Schmidt. I bought that book along with this one at the same time and I've found myself constantly refering back to Schmidt's book as it is excellent, and this one I've barely cracked since I opened the other."
2,D or less,The book makes me think of garage grade cabinets. These are the low end of the scale but the color pictures look good. I would never buy these types of cabinets or make them for my home.
2,book review,"The book does an OK job especially if it is the first one on that topic that you are reading. It is clearly written and the pictures are nice. However, there is too much duplication of the same theme, as well as details of construction and methods of assembly, which are described many times in the book un-necessarily. I have found reasonable amount of free information on the web as well as by looking at pre-built cabinets in retail stores. It provides very scant information about making doors.I would not use a 5/8"" melamine PCB (as recommended in the book)to make the sides and bottom of drawers, which increases the weight, decreases its effectual height and storage capacity. I was somewhat disappointed by the ""rigidity"" of the ""system"" described which restricts you to use the ""cut list"" only with little insight to customize it to your needs."
2,Should of read the reviews,"This book should be called ""Build European Style particle board cabinets"" or ""Build My style kitchen cabinets.."" I'm sure this is a great book if that's what you want to do. If not, it's pretty much useless. Doesn't make it a bad book, it just doesn't have any range for a broadly titled book."
3,Good introductory book.,"Overall, this book is of good quality and point you in the right direction to build your own kitchen cabinets.The title of the book is misleading in the sence that this book only tackle the europen frameless type cabinet build with MPB.One thing that I didn't like in this book is the fact that I had the feeling to read the same thing over and over and over again for each piece (base, top, corner, etc)."
5,Great Book and Detailed Construction Pictures,"I am going to install new kitchen cabinets in the coming month. I ordered this excellent how-to book to begin my research. It contains detailed pictures of the construction process and a system that can easily be applied by the do-it-yourself homeowner. Mr. Proulx shows an easy construction and installation system based upon the modern European technology applicable to cabinetry. With modern European hinges, cabinet legs, and construction materials, cabinetry is within the grasp of the homeowner. This book is not for a seasoned cabinet craftsman of the old school, but, rather, a nuts and bolts how-to book for the homeowner and woodworker with average skills and a shop with the necessary tools such as a table saw, drill, jigs, etc. The harder cabinet door and drawer construction can be avoided, if needed, by outsourcing the same. Definitely worth the money--Thanks Mr. Proulx."
2,Frameless Particle Board Only,"I wouldn't call the book worthless, as I have used it several times as a reference guide for dimensions and things of that nature while building my first set of cabinets. However, I did not expect this book to be about particle board boxes with hardwood face frames and panel doors, but that is just about all I found in it. If you are looking to build cheap cabinets quickly, you may find this book to be quite helpful. If you want to build high-end cabinets at a fraction of the cost, this is not the book for you. As other reviewers have mentioned, look for Udo Schmidt'sBuilding Kitchen Cabinets. I'm a firm believer in using the right tool for the job, and this may not be the right ""tool"" for your project... caveat emptor, as always...-E"
2,Not Enough to Build Cabinets,"Was very disappointed with the book. I returned it. If you build the cabinets EXACTLY the way the author advocates, the book might be helpful. Book could be good as an over view or a ""Do I want to build my own cabinets ??"" I also disagree with some of the methods of construction. Author suggested buying a good table saw. A ""good"" table saw capable of ripping 4x8 sheets of melamine would cost A LOT. There are jigs and many other tools available for cabinet construction that are a lot less expensive ( you could afford to buy if you only wanted to do one kitchen ) and more helpful. Hope this helps !!"
4,Good book for utilitarian cabinets,"I found this book clear and useful. I am building cabinets for my workshop,and its utilitarian approach is what I was looking for. If you are interested in solid wood, high end cabinets, it will prove less useful.I did find an error (I think) in the calculation for cabinet drawers in the top diagram on page 100. Mr. Proulx includes the 3/4 (or 5/8) inch thickness of the bottom of the cabinet as part of the ""free space"", i.e., the area where drawers can be installed. This doesn't make sense to me. I believe the free space should be 28 1/4 inch, not 29 inches (for a 3/4 inch bottom), which throws the ensuing calculations off a bit. He also doesn't indicate the one inch clearance below the bottom drawer, but it is included in the calculation.Still, this book works for me."
1,terriable,This book and every book i have gotten in the last 2 weeks are awful . I just got another book by Jeffery Piontkowski called The complete Cabinet makers Reference .this book cost me about 30 bucks it is the worse book i have ever bought .And would like to get my money back.Maybee i should wirte a book .Because my rating scores right now are going to be so low that there is no number that low except -o.sorry bad books
1,Pictures are terrible,I have the hard copy and thr illustrations and pictures are bright and colorfulI got the Kindle edition and the resolution of the pictures is really poor The pictures ate small and very darkI will return it immediatelyTo bad I really wanted this book on the Kindle
1,sorry I ordered.,"From the reviews and writeup I thought I had found something interesting. Was I disappointed. Amateurish; Not well presented; Not well explained. Use of door stops, cheap materials and plugging visible screw holes is not my idea of quality. Wish I could get a refund.Mark Walsh"
1,"Sorry, but I did not like it.","Sorry, but I did not like it. To the point that I sent the book back (my first time). The cabinets showed on the book are European style made mostly from plywood. If you are looking for a simple a very cheap cabinets, it may be the book for you."
2,"Contains enough info to build cabinets, but not complete","The author clearly knows how to build cabinets, but describes only his ""system"" and never deviates far from it. He has one piece of information he feels is very important (and I agree), use a 5/8"" melamine backer board. However, he harps on this idea in several chapters. Once would have been enough. He also prefers to purchase cabinet doors rather than make them. This makes perfect sense for a production shop, but as a hobbyist woodworker I was looking for information on how to build the beautiful cabinets pictured on the front of the book."
1,Don't. Just don't.,Please avoid this series. Even if you're a fan of the original BSG or the 2004 remake. ESPECIALLY if you're a fan of the original BSG or the 2004 remake.
1,the worst of BSG,"Only buy this if you absolutely must have every episode of this series (both old and new) ever made. Galactica 1980 is appalling, and it's clear to see why it was cancelled after just 10 episodes."
1,Blech!!!!,"Ranks up there with the ""Star Wars Holiday Special"" as some of the worst Sci-Fi ever put on TV."
2,The worst lesser Galactica,This is BSG the second season from the early 1980s. The show was brought back because of popular demand and a chance to cash in on Star Wars Hype. The fist season is B Grade cheesy fun but this season is barely watch-able. All that time to get to earth and this is the crap we got.The new BSG is far better than these originals. The new series achieved the potential we all new BSG had in it.It is till worth a look. Have a look at The Shape of things to Come if you like this.
3,It's about time!,"Like it or not, It's part of the original series which isn't complete without it. As with all series and sequels you can find fault in some parts and love others. I prefer the original series to the new but I still watch and collect both. I think the new series would have been better if they had kept those cool uniforms of old BG. and not turned them into Earthman suit and ties. They are supposed to be from a different world not present day Earth. And bullets in space, what happened to the laser guns? One addition I do like is the saying "" So say we all"".Love it or not BG 1980 is part of Galactica and I have pre-ordered my copy.The original is still the best! If you don't agree don't buy it.T. Roe"
1,Horrible,"When this came out I decided to watch it. Having gotten into the new Battlestar Galactica Series that ended last year on Sci-Fi, I figured I ought to watch the original series and this. 1980 is long, drawn out, and boring. It's storyline did not flow well and it is painfully obvious that this series was just slapped together. The only good episode is the last one of the series. I believe it's called The Return of Starbuck. Don't waste your money or time on this one."
2,"The ""Starbuck"" episode","I only saw Galactica 80 one time, very long time ago. I was twelve or something, I remember it was certainly not in the same league as the original.There was 1 episode however which was great, the last ""starbuck"" episode! For me, this episode is worth the purchase."
2,No where near what I remembered,"If you were a teen like me when this came out, Battlestar was still a big deal. I guess when you grow up, though, sometimes your younger brain remembers things differently. I forgot how cheezy the acting was. Sure, the effects were state of the art at the time, but still, acting is acting. It was still fun seeing the Galactica finally reach Earth, but beyond that, it was a let down.I should have stuck with my own memories. They were better than reality."
2,Get it out of your system,"Galactica 1980 is terrible. Besides the constant reuse of the same cut scenes over and over for special effect, and the seemingly every shortening cast & changeout throughout, the storyline itself is also poor. Conceptually, this series had the potential to be successful, but based on the actual execution of the plot, this is by far the most excruciating 10 hours of film you could subject yourself to. If you are a BSG fan, get this out of your system and wait for the upcoming season on SCI-FI."
3,Half hokey fun / half horrid horrid horrid excrement,"This show stared out promising but quickly went down hillIF you buy this DO NOT (I repeat DO NOT) under any circumstances watch ""Spaceball"" or ""Super Scouts""The 3-part pilot was fun in a hokey-late-seveties kinda way and there is a Halloween episode with Wolfman Jack that has Human-looking Cylons;these are cheesey fun.What you REALLY want this for is ""The Return Of Starbuck"" in which Dirk Benedict gives a tour-de force performance that makes you wonder why he never became a really huge star!! He carries practically the entire episode as he is marooned on an alien world with only a Cylon and an apparently mute woman for company.(Too bad the show was bookended with scenes of Dr.Zee{who really, really wasn't worth the sacrifice--you'll see})"
3,Battlestar Galactica - the complete series,The title online is a misreprestation because it says that it is the complete series but it is only the last season the series.
3,Battlestar Galactica 1980 - The Final Season,"This series is good, but it is not as good as the orignal ""Battlestar Galactica"", but it is a good followup. I just wished that the series would have continued longer. Sorry to see it go away."
1,False Advertisement,"This is NOT as labeled, Galactica 1980: The Complete Series. It is only the final season, a mere two disks for 7.99 for an ancient series. Also when I saw what arrived I checked the web site and it is still labeled the same as above; however the picture shows it as only the final season in very tiny print. Surprised by misrepresentation from this seller because I buy from them all the time."
3,Galactica 1980,"When I was younger,(teens) I thought it was GREAT! but now being a bet older, well, its just fun and goofy! It is a great and encouraging reminder of how my thinking has changed over the years, thank the Lord! On the other hand it does remind me of my thinking then and how my teens think now. Not much difference, thus perhaps I'm a better parent because of Galactica 1980! I can roll my eyes up and think, ""That was me!"""
3,More a comedy,"I was debating 3 or 4 stars but settled for 3. This is supposed to be the continuation of the original series. However it does not have the right feel at all. Missing are most of the original crew. That doctor Zee really gets on my nerve and I wish they had not introduced him. To be fair I only saw the last 7 episodes on NetFlix. My DVD order with the first 3 episodes is not here yet.The episodes are rather funny even the Cylons are comical. Specially the one in ""Return of Starbuck"". No matter it did give me a lot of laughs. So I guess it is a comedy with an environmental message :-) Not the best but not the worst. I like their flying motor cycles but the flying saucer sucks. Watching Adama practically bow to Dr. Zee is nauseating."
4,movie galactica 1980,if you like sci fi movies and shows you like this galactrica dvd with lorne green was worth the price
3,Not as good a the first.,"This is an interesting attempt to continue the series Battlestar Galactica. Most would even consider this just to be the second season of the show. This is probably just for the die hard original BG fans as most of the story lines are pretty lame except for the last episode which is why I and I think most people want this, ""The Return of Starbuck"" which I always thought was part of the original series. This one episode makes it worth the cost of $11, as you can not really feel like you have the entire series with out this episode. That said they should really package this with the original series and just charge a few dollars more for it because that is really all it is worth, the last episode aside."
1,So awful it'll make you...,"""Halloween epsiode"" of this series. Wolfman Jack guest-starring. Cylons walking around in NYC during Halloween so no one realizes they are alien robots. The two Viper pilots in pursuit of the Cylons run into the wrong building and end up singing and dancing in the middle of a stage musical.Read that again in case it didn't sink in: Viper pilots accidentally getting swept into a singing and dancing stage musical.If that isn't enough to make you scream in agony you have very, VERY poor taste in television.1 star because -100 is not possible."
2,Good,"I got this DVD, but it locks up all the time. One show I can't see period of the 8 shows on the two disks, because I can't get it past the blockage where it stopped. The others are fine. The others are perfect, and I would still get this set with all the problems."
2,"Low budget & campy, but worth seeing.","I agree with most of the former reviewers. This is a sad, after thought to the most ground-breaking sci-fi TV series EVER: Battlestar Galactica, the Epic Series (1978).The amazing music, the Cyclons, the cast, the writing and the incredible miniatures created by John Dykstra - the genius behind the spaceships in Star Wars - brought an epic, cinematic approach to television never before seen.I recommend this only as a ""completion"" to your original BSG collection, and for the handful of cool episodes mentioned in the other reviews.As far as the ""new"" Battlestar Galactica, I can only say one thing: CHEESE. The CGI is the WORST. The acting is third rate, and the writing is a FAR cry from the original series. I suffered through three episodes on the Sci-Fi channel and refused to watch it again. It may even be worse than 1980. It just cannot recreate the magic and genius of Glen Larson's original. Sorry."
1,Awful. Just painful.,"This is so painful to watch. Simply awful. I'm not sure which is worse, this or the Star Wars Holiday Special."
1,0 STARS is what I'd like to give it.,"Galactica 1980 has to be the worst sci-fi ever produced for television. Yes, even worse than Buck Rogers or Planet of the Apes (the series). I wouldn't go back & rewatch this show even if you paid me."
1,Galactica was always a joke,"the 1978 series had tons of effects and no plot. This series had no plot, few effects, and bad acting. The new show is nothing but porn, but so many worship it like it was a new relgion or something. All in all a show for losers."
2,Battlestar Galactica 1980,The only reason I bought this was to complete what I have on the series for Battlestar Galactica. I can see why this show was cancelled after a few episodes. I got tired of watching them chasing after that one guy who kept going to the past and watching scene after scene about the children. It was just too boring to watch them on Earth after being in outer space for so long. Only a die hard fan would want this and I guess that's why I bought it.
3,Had Potential,"Galactica 1980 had potential, but suffered from poor writing poor editing and not enough of a budget. They skipped the mystery of actually finding Earth and suddenly are already there. Then the Cylons pop out of nowhere after 30 years and force them to lead them away. How did they stay in range of Earth while flying away from it?! It was nice to see Lorne Green, but all he does is play 2nd fiddle to 'Dr Zee', Gone is the imaginative and decisive Adama of old. It is also a treat to see Barry Van Dyke as dillon. He does a wonderful job of getting into trouble trying to assimilate into Earth culture. He even accidently robs a bank!The plot eventually thickens with advanced cylon and human ships being introduced as well as human looking cylons. I think if the show had been allowed to go on and the writers had been willing to change the formula to advance the plot (that is, make real changes to Earth), they might have had a good story to tell."
2,The last episode is definitely the best,"Someone else commented on how lame this series was, except for the final episode. I totally agree. For the die hard Battlestar Galactica fan, it's worth having in a collection. It's also a fantastic contrast to the re-imagined series."
3,Pretty OK,"This was good in places, but the discs don't include any extras. The video quality was as good as to be expected for a late '70s early '80s TV show. This is at least good enough to complete one's classic Battlestar Galactica collection and continue one's overall Battlestar Galactica collection. One advanage of these discs is that one can select ""play all"" on the menu so that they can see all parts of these multi-part episodes without having to go back and select the next episode on the episode menu."
4,A story of survival,"This one is along the lines of The Pianist. It's well written, and provides another view into a time that I still can't fathom."
5,Purpendicular,"Band Personnell:Ian Gillan - VocalsSteve Morse - GuitarsRoger Glover - BassIan Paice - DrumsJon Lord - Organs and KeyboardsAfter Blackmore departed again, Satriani took over to complete the world tour of their last album, but he left shortly after without even a official recording, Blackmore's fully replacement was Steve Morse, he showed new life to the band and many even think this is the best they have done since the first part of Mark 2, this album is great."
5,Probably one of my all time favorites,"Purpendicular Waltz is pobably my favorite tune on this album. Deep Purple seems to have added a few extra years to their life with the new blood of Steve Morse. Sure some Deep Purple fans may say that it's not the same without Blackmore, but I feel they have progressed and are now finally going to stop spinnig their creative wheels. Blackmore leaving this time is the only way I feel that DP could have gone on."
4,Deep Purple with mandolin?,"That's no bull--in the song ""Aviator"", whose intonation and phrasing would make it possible for it to be done by a country act anyway. Not surprising when you think of it--this is the same outfit that did a pretty faithful cover of a Neil Diamond number (""Kentucky Woman"") early on in their career. DP's draft of Steve Morse to replace Ritchie Blackmore worked out better than maybe they even foresaw. I'm not going to argue Morse's technical prowess over Blackmore--that's largely a question of taste. But Morse's mandolin in ""Aviator"" means he's got Blackmore beat all hollow on versatility. Only time will tell how that will work in the long run."
2,Standard,"""Purpendicular"" just isn't that good of an album in my opinion. If ever there was an album that merited an ""all right"", this would be it. The material isn't very strong, Gillan sounds a bit tired, and the whole affair just doesn't quite cut it. The album's sole saving grace is Steve Morse. He plays with a vengeance, recalling more the Bolin glory days than Blackmore, but placing his indelible stamp on everything. A breath of fresh air that Purple sorely needed, but sadly the band doesn't have the songs this time out to warrant his effort. One of the weaker Deep Purple albums but still worth hearing if only for Steve's wicked riffing."
1,Horrible Beyond Belief,"I have been a Deep Purple fan since listening to Perfect Strangers (1984). Since Ritchie Blackmore left, the songs are totally different. The guitar playing, by Morse, and the overall arrangements are sub-par. When Blackmore was there, his compositions were beautifully written and arranged, with phenomenal guitar rhythms and solos. Purpendicular sounds a little like ""thrash"" in some parts with cheesy lyrics. Simply put, IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED! Perfect Strangers, The House of Blue Light or The Battle Rages On... are all highly recommended. Blackmore should return."
4,STEVE AND MORSE ARE A FINE COUPLE !!!,"This CD shows the caliber of Steve Morse's geniality. WHich guitar virtuoso could merge so well in a traditional band as Purple and lasts so long? Vai? Satriani? Malmsteen? No way. MOrse showed all his virtuosity and also all him humbleness, and merged himself smootly with Deep Purple, helping to record their best album in years, for sure."
3,"Good Cyberpunk, but with a lame ending","""Contraband"" is set in Foy's ""The Shift"" world. I like his future, its noir and gritty. The Pilot is a compulsive speed freak who makes a living smuggling contraband (organic memory chips, drugs, and illegal aliens) into the US. And the borders are tight. Suddenly, the borders get a lot tighter and the smuggler underground starts to collapse. The pilot starts a quest to find the king of smugglers to stop the end of his way of life.Foy is good. His narrative is good. His tech is good and so are his characters. However, he can't end a story. ""Contraband"" grinds to halt the way ""The Shift"" fizzled in the end. I suspect Foy is a novella-length story author with novel-length book contracts. Read it for the scenery."
1,Right Concept; Wrong Author,"The concept behind the book is a good one, but it was rather poorly executed. It started off okay, but as it got further, it became more of a chore to read. It didn't seem as if the author's heart was really in it. To see how this concept fares when properly executed, try Walter Jon Williams' *Hardwired*."
3,Inexpensive battery,The battery appears to work good and was received in an acceptable amount of time.
1,"Arrived ""Old"" - terrible!!!","This product was REALLY BAD.When it arrived, after opening one of the energy bars, it looked like it had melted and also had some white fuzzy stuff all over it.YUCK!Because this was so bad, I hesitate to buy more food products from Amazon grocery. I've asked Amazon to resolve this."
1,DECEIVING!!!!!!,"This bar was shaped nothing like the picture. It is practically just a straight bar, there is hardly even a bend in the bar. I was very deceived by the image of the product. I rate this bar zero out of five stars."
2,mekugi pegs,"Does not come with the 2 pegs as described in the list, and thats what I was hoping for since my other broke on me :( I also needed the cleaning kit as well. It's an ""OK"" Kit, But nothing deluxe..."
4,GET IT BEFORE IT GETS YOU!,"""Music to crack skulls by""--probably YOURS while you're furiously headbanging. NEW LIVE & RARE could be considered VENOM'S finest work, except that CRONOS isn't grunting out the lyrics on these, it's the death-defying DEMOLITION MAN on bass & vocals. Will definitely make any Venom fan turn over every gravestone looking for more CD's with the D-man on 'em. All tracks are ferociously fast, loud and crazy, venturing into punk territory at times, but with very little satanic foolishness. Best track: TEMPLES OF ICE, hardcore homage to HP Lovecraft! GET IT BEFORE IT GETS YOU!"
4,This was an unexpected great find.,"I came across this one kind of by accident when I was looking for some Judas Priest cover songs. They do a rockin' cover of Hellbent for Metal (Leather). They also do Speed King by Deep Purple and Megalomania by Black Sabbath. I grew up during this era and I'm surprised that I didn't hear of them before now. There were just so many bands to keep up with back then and no internet. Their vocals, speed and power remind me a lot of Motorhead. My favorite track is Skeletal Dance. The album cover is really cool to. Its a definite keeper."
2,Too Loud!!,Bought this at Target.Fan is way too loud. I got the Lasko unit which was quieter and provided good performance.
1,It broke after 1 year,"This heater worked reasonably well until the plastic base fell off. The unit tipped over easily, it was top heavy. Poor design, poor quality.I really regret getting this cheap plastic heater that I have to throw out after one year. Is anything made to last anymore?"
5,Love This Chair,"Love this chair. I rarely review products but this task chair is so comfortable and solid that I felt the need to share the news. It took 5 minutes to assemble. The controls work flawlessly, allowing me to lock the swivel of the seat and the seat back in the exact position I want. I am a big guy, and this chair is much more solid than the chairs that I wear out once a year."
3,adequate,"The part that actually holds water/mud is very small. It also should have a provision to hook together with outer mats, since Husky doesn't offer a one piece to extend entire width of floor."
