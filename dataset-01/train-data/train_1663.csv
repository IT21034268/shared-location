2,Broken Item,I couldn't use this item because they send me broken item. I gave them 2 stars because they gave my money back but it took a time.
3,xt,"I do not know much about memory card. I do not know that, this card is better or not as good as the other cards. But this card works OK."
1,Olympus card,"I thought the Olympus Picture card was to be used in the Canon camera I purchased, but it won't fit."
4,Very good,"I install this card to my Camera, work well, now i can store a lot of pictures on it. enjoy it."
3,Olympus xD picture card,"If you own the Olympus E-410 and you want to take panoramas you must use this card. The E-410 will hold this card as well as a CF card. You can switch between the cards, but only the xD card can be used for panoramas. I've found that it is a bad idea to use the xD card for anything else but panoramas because of the way the pictures are labled. Keeping the different types apart seems to work. If anyone has another idea I'm open to suggestions."
2,Good for it's price but went down in 2 weeks,"We got it little late than we thought it would be but we were still happy to get it. At that time we lived in USA, now we are in Europe and the Picture Card went down, we can not make any pictures, we can not downlanda any it is not working at all. We are getting a msg on our brand new Olympus Camera 7010 that there is a problem with Picture card, that we should clean it or format it but non of it works. We can't format it at all.So for the price we payed about $18 it was good but it is a shame it worked only for 3 weeks for us.Would not recommend."
4,Good Product,Worked well while taking 600 High Qaulity photos while on vacation in Alaska. Would have given 5 stars if packing was less wastefull and smaller card storage container was provided.
3,XD Media Memory Cards = Propietary Technology = Expensive,"There may be some added features that come with this propietaty card format from Olympus, but none that are worth the added cost in my book. The cost per megabyte of storage space is almost double of an SD memory card. Plus the XD card is almost impossible to find in some countries, like Guatemala for exmaple. I was unable to buy one before I left for a vacation, but I thought it would not be a problem. I will just buy one once I arrive in Guatemala - WRONG. I had to visit about a dozen retail electronics stores before I found one, which was very overpriced. In the end, I returned the Olympus camera because I am a fan of Canon digital cameras because no other brand takes better photos. I hope this helps!"
3,The price was OK.,"I was happy with the quality. The price for this memory is high compared to SD type memory, but nothing I can do about that."
3,Photo Card,"Performs jsut fine; glad it was available, for an older product (electronic photo frame) that would have been useless without this device. Came packaged very well and arrived in an exceptionally quick turn-around."
5,No problems here,Never had any problems with any XD memory cards. The 2Gb card holds almost 800 pics on a 10 Megapixel camera. Amazon is nearly half the price of the electronic retailers...
2,"Plenty of storage, but very slow to write.","The xD format is the only type of card my Fuji F30 will accept, so I'm stuck with a card that has nice capacity (337 images at full 6MP Fine resolution)...but takes seemingly FOREVER to write files.Granted, it COULD be that the F30 itself is a bit slow, but I think it has more to do with the sluggish write speed of the M-type card. The slow performance seriously hampers shot-to-shot speed with the camera."
3,Insurance,"I much prefer the CF cards, but the camera has an xD slot so why let it go to waste. Think of it as a reserve tank."
5,Es,"Great price, I checked everywhere before purchasing. Shipped out quickly. Definately would use this company again."
2,More product info would have been appreciated,I suppose the XD card is good cos i read the reviews. but i didn't realise that it would be incompatible with my olympus camera which is of an older model.So i actually can't use it.Would have been helpful if there was some information provided on compatibility with camera models
4,Totally worth it,Good product to invest in. Paranomic features works wonder. Should be available in 4GB or 8GB
5,Olympus xD card,I can say that I love my new card. I only wish they would still make them to be adaptable to all computers for viewing.
1,Olympus xd card,"There was a glitch with the card. I took our camera on our month long vacation that we planned for a long time. When I tried to put the pics on our computer, it said the card was empty. When I had it in our camera, it said it was full. We lost all of our pics on our vacation. It was very sad."
3,"Good for pics, Bad for video","One of the reasons we bought our new Olympus digital camera was to take simple video without carrying around a separate digital video camera. We bought this memory card, but never saw anywhere listed that you can only take 10 seconds of video at a time with a Type-M XD card. In fact, I had to dig deep into Olympus' site to find that information out. Now I have two XD cards, Type-M and Type-H. Would have been helpful to know prior. For normal pictures, however, works just fine. But if you want video, pony up for the more expensive Type-H card."
5,BRILLIANT,I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER WITH MY OLYMPUS XD PICTURE CARD. IT WORKS FLAWLESSLY AND ALLOW ME TO TAKE 294 PICTURES AT SUPER HQ ON MY OLYMPUS STYLUS 710.
3,READ IMMEDIATELY --- OBSOLETE,"This card is rather obsolete. The Type M+ is much much better. This card can only record EIGHT SECONDS of high quality VGA video at 30 FPS. On the M+, it can record up to about a half an hour, which is huge at least to me. Buy that card instead, which, incidentally, appears to be cheaper. I didn't and now I will have both the M and M+, spending almost $30 more than I need to. Don't make my mistake."
5,Olympus 2 G xD Picture Card,I purchased this card before a vacation where I expected to take a lot of photos and videos. I had no problem with the card and it holds 744 photos at the SHQ 2288x1712 setting or 1 hour and thirty minutes of video at the HQ setting.
4,Good product,"Usually the ""Olympus"" brand memory tend to be cheaper than the rest. I own several and so far I've never had any problems with them."
3,"Not the best B&C book, but interesting reading","This is not the best book due to lack of research - many authors seem to complie previously researched facts & information. It is interesting and goes into great detail to explore the legend of Bonnie and Clyde. Reviews all movies and discusses the charachters vs the tru people at length. Not the best, but a nice addition to your collection. John N. Phillip's book is by far the best yet!"
2,Bonnie and Clyde,Not as great as I was hoping it would be. Have read better written books on the couple and I have read most of them available.
4,BONNIE AND CLYDE,"WELLL THE BOOK I READ ABOUT WAS SO COOL AND INTRESTING.EVENTHOUGH I ONLY READ A FEW PAGES .I GOT A FEW CAPTATIONS OF THE BOOK ...BASICALLY THE BOOK WAS ABOUT,HOW IN THE LATES 1930'S TWO TO LIVE THEIR ROMANCE BY MAKING CRIMES...THE CHARACTERS OF THIS BOOK WERE BONNIE PARKER AND CLYDE BARROW..WHO WHERE A YOUNG SOCIOPATHIC SOUTHERN COUPLS GUNNED DOWN BY AUTHORITIES AFTER TWO YEARS OF CMMITING CRIME, WHO LEFTED 12 PEOPLE DEAD.THE BOOK WAS ALSO INTRESTING BECAUSE I WAS ABLE IMAGING AND PICTURE MANY OF THE READING THAT I WAS MAKING ....I WOULD RECOMMENED TO READERS WHO LIKE TO READ ABOUT CRIME, TO READ THIS BOOK BECAUSE IT S VERY MYSTIRIOUS AND FUN. THE AUTHOR TELLS THE WHOLE UNEDIFYING STORY FROM WRETCHED CHILDHOOD TO WRECTCH DEATH, BLOODY FAME AND WITH CLARITY, LEVEL HEADEDNESS AND WITH ECONOMY."
1,A Second-Rate Publication,"An irreverant excuse for a publication that assumes WAY too much and poorly connects the elements of science, art and religion that would leave the spirit of Thomas Dick himself mourning in his grave. The author's an apparent Anglophile who should render the service of going back to England and staying there!1/2 STAR, if allowed!"
4,A handy all-purpose home medical reference,"{Review written June 2005}This is a handy all-purpose home medical companion, which is useful for reading up on various problems and conditions as you, your family and friends encounter them in life.Want to read up on the various forms of arthritis ? It's in there.Diabetes ? Menopause ? Sprains ? Bloody Noses ? Sleep disorders ? Various surgical procedures ? Ditto.It's a good all purpose resource. My copy cost me $1 at a yard sale, and it's been worth every penny, many times over ... even though it's slowly become a little dated since it was first published.It's recommended, and used copies can usually be found for a pittance."
3,5 gal water jug,This did not turn out to be as great as I thought it would. If room is very limited I would suggest it. Room was not as big of an issue for us as we thought it might be. It does fold nicely and does hold 5 gal. of water. We use it as a spare.
1,Not the greatest water carrier,"I have two of these, I no longer use them though. The first one , the valve screw broke and the second one had a leak in the seam.I ended up buying a 7 gallon hard plastic jug"
1,dont bother,"Do not waste your money. Took on a 3 day primative camp trip. Cap will not tighten onto bottle without stripping out so it could not be used in a position to use the valve. Purchase a Reliance brand bottle instead, they have served me well."
1,Stay away,"This is a piece of junk. On first use i noticed it is nearly impossible to prevent a leak from the threads. After a couple of uses sitting on picnic tables or the ground, multiple punctures have developed, that I have had to patch. The plastic is cheap and easily punctures. Its depressing to get to the middle of nowhere and find an empty container with water all over the floor of your trunk. Coleman products are cheap, you get what you pay for. I am done with buying Coleman."
1,Skip it.,"This water jug is horrible. Stick with the old blue Coleman ones or the clear ones with the red handle. I camp often (6-7 times a year) and I've not had one good camping experience with this jug. It doesn't fold up well, making it cumbersome when packing. The spout is useless. The water comes out slowly, making it frustrating and useless. I'm probably just going to throw it in the recycle bin purchase one of the brands I've bought in the past."
3,don't drop it!,"I filled the jug, and accidentally dropped it, the cap popped off. Otherwise , it works for my intended purpose."
4,MEKONG DELTA - VISION FUGITIVES,"I am a very picky and selective individual after being into the METAL scene for 25 years so I am pretty jaded. HENCE, I found this disc to be a very nice listen and worthy addition to my collection.This band is technical, symphonic and well orchestrated. The vocals are a bit sunken into the production mix but gives an atmospheric feel to it. But overall, I was into this disc and I recommend other metalheads to give this disc a try if you are into thrash, technicality and classical symphonic orchestrations."
5,Love it!,"This is a great piece of work. It sounds like a mix of classical music, thrash and prog rock. Nothing less than 5 stars."
4,A good product,"I purchased several of these to tame my husband's DVD collection. We're mac users, so the software that comes with it doesn't work on our computers. Instead, I put together a spreadsheet of all of the DVDs and which carousel they're in and what number. They've been great. My husband likes to play ""movie roulette"" and just picks a number then we watch whatever comes out. They're great at reducing space that DVDs in their cases take up. We recycled all of the cases and now keep everything in these. My only complaint is that they area little noisy when rotating to get the DVD that you select. Overall, a good purchase."
5,Love it,"Im so happy to not have to manually search through dozens of backup disks etc now. Also a real spacesaver (I threw out all my old klunky, half broken jewel cases). It will also catalog them all in a searchable database (Yes including file names if you click the right options)As others said, the arm seems a bit flimsy, but I don't think it's flimsy enough to break from normal use. Also glad they gave a choice of colors. White/putty would definitely have been out of place here."
4,They're getting there,"I like this. But it seems archaic to have to open the sliding door to get a disc out -- there ought to be something that mechanically opens it. And if you forget to close it, then dust can get in. And I'm always afraid I didn't align the disc exactly right in the arm holder.But for storage, it's pretty good. Much better than having cds/dvds in cases everywhere."
4,So So Good...,"So far the unit is working well. As with another review I must say the units disc arm seems a bit flimsy. I only gave it 4 stars due to the software. It's a bit clunky and cumbersome to use however I believe that this is an excellent investment for anyone who collects movies, CDs or just has a lot of discs laying around. I would recommend this product although hopefully they will make a larger capacity unit in the future!"
3,Better than the rest but still needs tweaking..,"This Carousel is at least better than the Imation version which I couldn't even get to accept a disc. But still has some tweaking to be a 5 star. First off.. the software is minimal at best it's as friendly as excel (which IMHO isn't friendly). Second is.. my disc does not go in perfect every time, sometimes I to have to push it in a little better with my finger. Once I didn't, and told the software to change the disc accidentally, and the Carousel bent the disc to the point of when I took it out it broke. Despite all this I gave it a three because even after that major malfunction it still worked and really what else is there out there?"
3,Looks Good but takes alot of manual work,When I first recieved the unit I was impressed with the way the unit looked. I was disapointed with the fact all of the data has to be entered in manually. I have an imation unit and like the fact there is no power plug required and it will gather the informtaion from your disk/DVD automatically.
5,Great item,"While it is a little on the pricy side for a storage container, our CDs no longer get scratched and we can go to the computer and pull up exactly which CD we want!"
1,Don't waste your money,After going thru some competitiors problematic units our company decided to try this model.When it works it functions as expected. After several months it started flashing a SOS message and that was pretty much the end of its life. Strangly enough the users manual does not indicate what could be wrong or even reference the error message. After powering on/off and getting it to work for about 60 seconds it went back to its sinking ship message.This failure is not a just a one time problem. Many hits using Google with no resolution.Unless you want it to sink your ship also don't waist your money.
2,"a difficult and obtuse read, for the scholar only.","Although this book has plenty of information, the vast majority of it is presented in such a lenghty and wordy manner that it is very difficult to follow, much less to understand. Any reader will be sure to find something useful and interesting in the various topics covered, but be prepared to be completely lost on a regular basis."
3,Good but beware,"This person Robert Ross knows television but his book is written in a horridly repetitious style (constant references to ""glam girls"" and ""pure class"") and is filled with a distressing amount of errors. He obviously used a spellcheck program instead of a proofreader, so we get the information (in the first paragraph on the first page!) that the show started with the Sousa march and a huge ""bear"" foot. It does not improve. As far as grammer and punctuation go, I'm not the type of person to hate a book for bad grammer and horrifying punctuation -- but if I were, I would hate this book. Nontheless, even though its flaws are terribly annoying, my interest in Python and post-Python was renewed, so I suppose that it did its job."
1,Not My Cup of Dead Parrots.,"I'm a big Monty Python fan,and this book leaves a lot to be desired.Whereas I am not as rabidly annoyed as some readers,I am bothered by the lack of accurate information.We consult ""Encyclopedias"" for facts not guessess. There is a lot missing here. I question how hard it is to mispell names from screen credits.(example: The Missionary - Ishaq Bux is labeled as ""Ishay Bex"").Information on various Books,CD's and vinyl are missing too. And yes, ""Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas"" is never mentioned by its correct name!(Ross calls in ""Love & Drugs in Las Vegas"" and ""Down & Out in Las Vegas""). Shoddy work. I would love to praise this book for having good photos,but they have all been printed before! (Except the 3 Autographed to Ross,but then I have Python photos autographed to me too.). For the Python purest I recommend any other book! This one is the pause that regurgitates on the reader!"
2,How did this get such good reviews?,"I found this book somewhat informative as far is just raw data is concerned but poorly written. The author seems more intent at getting his opinions across than providing information. Specifically I refer to his occasional remarks about how British comedy is far superior to anything that the United States could produce (I was actually waiting for him to refer to the States as ""the colonies"").LUCKILY I received this book free for purchasing the complete set of Python videos. Had I paid money for it I would have been very disappointed.The ONLY reason I gave this two stars instead of one is because it does have good information. However reading through the author's comments are just too frustrating. At some point in the future it will provide me with kindling for a nice warm fire. I haven't touched it since my first and only reading."
3,Not a lot of pictures,"This encyclopedia is filled with information not just on Monty Python, but on the individual members as well. What I mean is, not only do we read about things like ""Life of Brian"" and ""The Meaning of Life,"" but we also hear about ""Silverado"" and ""Splitting Heirs.""The book provides a chronology starting with John Cleese's birthday in 1939 to 1997. There is also a list of videos and books as well as addresses for the British and American fan clubs.The focus for the entries is on the Monty Python cast. For instance, not a lot of information is given on the movie ""Silverado,"" but there is quite a bit of information about John Cleese's role in the movie.Unfortunately, there are not a lot of pictures in the book. Personally, I think that would be a grand addition to this work.I would recommend this for diehard fans of Monty Python."
3,I Was Expecting the Spanish Inquisition,"Seriously. Nowhere in the book do I see it even mentioned. If someone has seen it, please inform me. The book is ok, but some of the information stated is biased or irrelevant."
5,Very satisfied,"I found this item to be of great quality. The picture is clear and the detail jewels on one side are a nice touch, wish they were on both sides.Will not be disappointed."
4,Introspection on the high seas,"It's very good as a sailing memoir, but it's also a deeply introspective and at times painfully honest self-examination. The author presents herself ""warts and all"", which makes for a few passages of uncomfortable reading, as if you're eavesdropping on a private conversation. She's a bit mean to one crew member, but balances it with generosity towards another, and by her deeply felt concern-edging-towards-despair for her aging expatriate parents. The result is an amazingly detailed self-portrait -- after reading this book, you'll know Lydia Bird, good points and bad, as well as you know your closest friends. But it all comes back to the sailing, which is rendered in vivid, sometimes breathtaking detail."
1,Sonnet,"It's unbelievable how someone with Lydia Bird's obvious writing talents can write such a bad book. And shame on the editor who allowed this to happen. Bird wallows in self-pity throughout the entire book. Her self-pity is brought about by an alcoholic mother, a sick father, and the obligatory bad childhood, which frankly sounded pretty good. At one point she writes in the ship's log, ""This sounds empty and silly as I write it, but it made sense."" No, the passage was empty and silly and there are hundreds just like it in the book. What's even worse is Bird subjects the reader to her poetry, as if her expository writing weren't bad enough. If you're looking for a book about sailing, this isn't it. If you're looking for the scribblings of a self-engrossed adult who still has a lot of growing up to do, this one's for you."
5,Best waders I've bought,"And hopefully the last ones. Great fit, very comfortable. Took them out a week after I bought them and wore them for several hours. They definitely work much better than the old pair I had before. And the great thing is that I was dry after taking them off - what a great feeling!!"
2,"Be gone, sticky demon!","Be sure to keep a cookie sheet underneath the pan because it is extremely wobbly when full. Cooks fine and loaves pop out easily. But it is a horrible thing to clean. In fact, after the first use, it never was technically clean again. A sticky film has taken over the pan. I've soaked, scrubbed, boiled and cursed the thing to no avail. It will not come clean. I've tried to ignore the stickiness when using it. But no more! I'm going back to a good old fashioned metal pan."
2,Not that good,I bought this book hoping to get help preparing for the SAT. This book is just a list of 100 questions from general math and comparative math sections with complete answers. I took a practice SAT that was the actual May 1988 SAT and there were many things that I could not find in this book.
1,I have no words...,"Following the passing of my mother-in-law a few months ago, my wife has been busily engaged in closing out the estate. Amongst the many, many good books in the large library was this little softbound pamphlet with a 1972 copyright date (my wife and most of her sibs attended BYU in the '70s and/or '80s; it's unknown which of them got their hands on this book). Upon looking at its cover, I thought it might be a clever and engaging overview of the dating scene at BYU. It's neither. Why Barb Black (whoever she was) bothered to put this little tome together is a total mystery. It's just plain stupid. If anyone spent $2.00 (the price printed on the cover) for this thing, they should demand their money back plus a fee for their wasted time. Fortunately the book is evidently out of print. Trust me, there's no need to try and resurrect it."
3,Cutting-edge design is not the only design,"This book features virtually no organic styles or traditional layouts. I felt the designs were very corporate, cold and modern Euro-looking, which I find has limited application for inspiring the type of design work I do (luxury goods branding and design). I did go through the book very thoroughly.If you're looking for a broad range of styles (traditional and organic styles included) this isn't the book for you.In general, Wilson Harvey books are great, but usually follow the above pattern."
5,PBR rocks and so does this game!!!,"I love the pbr, so what better way to have the pbr every day than a game. This game is NOT for people who who don't like or don't know anything about the pbr. You need to understand the concept of it before you play the game. The graphics are great and it is cool how you can be the cowboy or the bull. Anyone who says that this game stinks is out of their mind and probably can't appreciate the awesomeness that is the PBR!!!!"
4,OK Game,"This game was NOT all I expected. Yes, it is very cool you can make your own cowboys and bull, but that is the most exciting part. When you rid the bull it is supposed to take eight seconds, but on the game it takes about 2. Still this game is WAY better than the first."
5,Field Points screw in type,I ordered this for my parker crossbow so I could practice shooting without using broadpoints. This is good value. It fits my parker carbon bolts. The weight is the same I am using. This company shipped it fast and arrived intact.
5,A Good Book For The Holidays,"I think this is a great book written by Charles Dickens. Dickens is awesome at describing the setting in the story which gives you a real feeling of the story. The story is about a mean old man named Ebeneezer Scrooge. But with the help of a few ghosts and his dead business partner Jacob Marley, can Scrooge change his way of life before Christmas? This is an awesome book, and I recommend it to anyone who loves a good book to read just before Christmas."
4,"Good Product, Good Service",Good double C.D. with v.good quality sound from a mixed bag of sources. One or two stand-out songs. Good service from supplier.
3,Looks Cool,"I bought this barrel because everyone says that the stock barrels for Tippmanns are really bad. Well, they aren't quite as bad as everyone says. Yet, this upgraded barrel is a noticable improvement. It won't transform your game, or suddenly make you a superstar on the field. It does improve your accuracy a little. It also looks pretty nice and people might think you're more of a ""real"" player when they see it. In my opinion, the confidence that this barrel gives you is a greater advantage than it's impact on your marker's accuracy. Other pro's are it's relatively affordable price and it's durability. The main con is that it's called a sniper barrel, and someone might actually think that if they buy it that they can take their Tippmann 98 and a ghillie suit into the woods and say, ""one shot, one kill."" Don't count on it."
5,Awesome,"EVERYONE tells me that my kick sounds better than any kick they've ever heard. It has this full, thick WHUUUMP that is exactly the sound you think of when you think ""awesome kick sound""."
1,BAD-digo,"Rarely has the Chicago music scene witnessed such a flaming wreck of human diaster. This ill-conceived band attempted to ride the faltering wave of success that once supported ""Desert Rain"", the eastern tinged hit by Sting. Inaudible monotone vocals coupled with psuedo-spanish guitar stylings, left urban club crowds scratching their heads. My fondest memory of this awful band was a show they played at the Elbo Room (a popular jumping off point for many local acts). It was late '99 or early '00. Baddigo had just delivered another painful set to an unswayed audience. The poor fellas milled about the club trying to get people to sign-up on their mailing list when the next band took the stage. They were barely teenagers and called themselves ""Sleeping at Last"". Suddenly the entire club woke up as these youngsters rocked the F'n house! Everyone took notice. Billy Corrigan of Smashing Pumpkins fame now produces them. Boy did Baddigo suck."
3,A good collection addition,"The production was a little bit lacking, and Jimmy's vocals were a bit unrefined, but the music makes a nice addition for any collection."
1,It sucks,I bought this book for my 13 year old niece who is an obsessive my chemical romance fan. The book got a millon trillon facts wrong. For instance it got the lead singer Gerard Way's birthday wrong. Also they spelt his name wrong throughout the book. Also Gerard is born in 1977 and the book said that in 1966 he went to school for comic book art. Then he proceeded to graduate in 1999. This little fact was really amazing because he must of started school in his mother's womb.
1,What Kind of a joke is this?,"I bought this because I am a big fan of MCR. I love their music, and when I read this, I gave up halfawy. Is the author on crack or something?Seriously now, everything about MCR in this book is wrong. THEY ARE NOT BRITISH. Gerard is spelled ""Jerard"" throughout the book. IT also says that ""Jerard"" went to an art school when he was young.The author also tries to be correct, but not done.BUY AT YOUR OWN PERIL!And I know this is off topic"
1,What?,"Gerard's name is spelled incorrectly, his birthday is wrong and apparently he started art school eleven years before he was ever born.I also was not aware of the fact that Belleville and Chicago were located in Britain."
1,uh,I havent bought this item.. And I don't intend to!!What was this guy smoking? Seriously. Angst. The description of the book totally annoyed me. I hope you can be sued for being so wrong.
1,Cramps,Molasses is great for your health but this particular brand gave me severe constipation...even with 1/2 tsp in water...I stopped using it for a week; then tried it again with less amount and still cramped me up.
1,petroleum aftertase,The molasses itself and everything that I've baked using this molasses ends up with a peculiar petroleum aftertaste. I have mentioned this to others and they have likewise experienced the same aftertaste. At least being unsulfured it will stands a better chance of passing emissions if burned...
5,A peaceful chill out movie.,It will make you dream of the beach. It may put you to sleep. It is perfect and it is calm.
5,Alamar: Simply Outstanding,"An amazing film really. And it's not just the magnificent photography that captures the natural beauty, as well as the incredible relationship between Father and Son (and the older Father/Son, and Grandfather/Grandson relationships). What makes this movie a masterpiece is the subtle presentation of the purpose of life and how our modern existence is, in contrast, so incredibly uninvolving, mediocre, and fraudulent. The purpose and intelligence of life is shown through the day to day work these fishermen do. It is done with such clarity and compassion by the film makers and actors, that it has restored my faith in human beings."
5,Utterly beautiful,"One of the loveliest films I've ever seen. An affair between a vacationing Italian woman and Jorge, a fiercely handsome Mexican fisherman, leads to the birth of a little boy, Natan. The couple breaks up, with sadness but no rancor, because there is no way to accommodate the distance between their respective worlds. When he is probably around five, the boy goes to spend a summer with his father and grandfather. The father offers all that he has: himself, his love, and his world. It is a world of men who live in nature, doing things a child can share, filled with wonder and beauty. At the end of their time together, a bond has formed between father and son.. ""I will always be with you."""
4,Relaxing movie,This is a very good movie with beautiful scenery and has a nice story as well. We have watched it several times and enjoy it. You will forget it is a documentary.
1,"Cool cover model, Wrong inside model.","This book is a absoluetly a wrong book. I was very tensed to take a look(rather a glance) for the amazing cover character, but when I bought this book, wrong and ugly character was shown for describing character modeling. No eye building details, No apologizing comment about wrong character using. This book is impossible. I can't believe it!"
1,Dont find it useful in anyway,"I dont find this book anywhere near to useful for me. I'd prefer the other character animation book from George and of course Disney's Illusion of life. With those 2, you can live without this one. It's nothing more than some common sense work."
2,The Skeptic,"This is not a review, I was just wondering what they would have to say about Maya, Story Telling or Character Animation of all things, when none of them seem to have a back ground in Animation or Entertainment in general...by the way, the two stars is just giving them the benefit of the doubt I still think it's cool that they have a book at all on Maya...every little bit helps..."
5,Priceless,"I am a beginning animator who just graduated a few months ago. I felt I was getting shorted on my education so I bought your new book along with the Maya complete set. I am only up to the texturing section of the book, but I want to say, WOW! What an awesome tool to have by you when you are burning the midnight oil. Because of your book I am completely starting over on my first story animation. Now I plan to do it the right way, which will definitely make life easier on me in the long run. I think that your book should be taught in schools along side the learning maya2 book. I found the sections on creating stories and designing characters very helpful. By the way, these other critics that I just read must have too much time on their hands to pick the book apart like that. Thank you for the book and you are welcome for the sixty dollars. See ya at the top!"
3,"Not bad, but also not very good","Bill Fleming always says that modeling with polygons is better than nurbs. Why is this I didn't know, until I read this book. The fact is you learn a lot of good modeling, but the hard way. Sure the book has great info, but impractical if you want to get in the business of 3d. You can't waste your time modeling like it teaches you while you know you can do a good job in a lot less time with another technique. Be practical."
3,"Not bad, could be better","While I praise the book for teaching methods of NURBS modelling, some of the methods tend to be very awkward. And the animation portion of the book is rather tedious and long-winded. It tells you that for each joint you create, you have to create attributes menus for them, and create other menus to make them move. You get rather lost because the techniques are very long and complicated. Meanwhile, my Maya teacher taught me a much easier method for animating a jointed skeleton."
3,"good animation, but bad modeling","I bought this book, hoping that it would have some patch modeling tutorials for maya. The tutorials used trim edges to connect surfaces. This is a bad way to model a character. It makes for bad seems and is system resource intensive. It does have excellent skeleton building and facial animation tutorials, if that is what you are looking for. I would not recommend it to a novice Maya user."
1,"""EXPERTS""?","What is it with you ""experts"". You tout yourselves like you're gods gift to computer animation but you're not smart enough to write a book that is remotely effective in teaching what you know. The book is confusing and frustrating, it suceeds in making you want to change your career. I would take my name off this book if I had any part in it."
3,"Not bad, but not too much","Even when this book could be helpfull for beginners, if you have a little experience you'll find that it goes not too far on animation and maya features. Characters are designed not in the best way. There's not much more inside this book than in the tuts of Alex alvarez you can find on the net. Buy it just if you are still learning and want a bit of light in the process of seting up a character. Otherwise, i'd prefer to get on the net and download a few tuts"
3,Beginners need not apply!,"Ok, maybe this book would be good for me if I wanted to have my third Hawaii Ironman be my best ever. But since I am still wobbling along on my bike in the sprint distance, the book is currently a door stop. Maybe this means that I am not yet a ""competitive"" multisport athlete :)"
2,Mortals need not apply,"With all due respect to the author; unless you are training for the olympics or an Ironman, do not get this book. This book was rated for experienced triathletes, definitely not for beginners or novices. Too technical and scientific and a very dry read. Hire a coach, you're better off.I'm a runner and am venturing into Triathlons. In a few years I may be able to understand this book and it may be of some value."
5,This is TRIATHLON BIBLE,If you have trained for enough to discover you don't know what you are doing and you need help this is the book for you. It covers pretty much everything about training for triathlon (most of the advise applies to any sport but the examples and emphasis is targeted to triathlon).You could also stand up with the right foot If you are new to sports but can grasp the knowledge in here.Good luck trainingPS I am waiting for the revised version and I heard it is on the works
3,"REVIEW BY AN OLDER,RECREATIONAL ATHLETE","I'm 57, and returned after a 15-year hiatus this spring to participate in multi-sport events. I think Friel's book would be great for the younger triathlete, or an older, dedicated triathlete with the time and energy to devote a aminimum of 20-25 hours a week to training. For the old geezer like me--- that is to say, a marginal athlete with a job, a family, other interests, and a maximum of twelve hours a week to train, this book is totally inappropriate. It's far too technical and clearly targets younger athletes already competing at or near the elite level. Something comparable to Galloway's 2nd edition book on running or his ""Marathon---You Can Do It"" would be far more useful to somebody at my level."
5,The Holy Grail of Individually Trained Triathletes,"Joe Friel has done an amazing job on preparing this comprehensive triathlete training manual. Engaging as a read from start to finish, yet cross referenced well enough for virtually anyone to open it and find specific areas, this book covers it all. Friel believes in the art and philosophy of training as well as the scientifics--of which there are plenty, so the reader is given a ""why"" as well as a ""how."" You will be immersed in training ideas, nutrition, physiological data, calendars, and more. This book was vital in pushing me from being a recreational participant to a legitimate competitor."
5,True to the title,"It's no hyperbole. This is indeed the most comprehensive book on triathlon training ever written. And unless the way people train changes radically in the next decades, I can't imagine anything surpassing Friel's book. Particularly of note are the scheduling guides and parts on periodization. I find his views on diet, although counter to my lifestyle, interesting as well.Several people have mentioned the value of this work for self-coached athletes. I'm coached, yet I believe it's still my most valuable resource. You can never know too much.My only misgiving is that my competition will read and follow the book!"
1,Blah Blah Blah,"...I have read about four triathlon books and this definitely ranks last. The author bores you with complex concepts and fitness buzzwords. One good thing I can say about this book - At least each section is short, so you will eventually get through it.If you want some good info on triathloning, then read 'Triathlon 101' and subscribe to 'Triathlete Magazine' or 'Inside Triathlon'."
4,"Murder, Music and Mystery","As a bookseller, I read many, many books by new authors, most of them mysteries. The quality ranges from truly awful to sublime and this one falls very near the top. Ms. Ham follows one of the cardinal tenets for any writer---write what you know about---and her experiences as a gospel singer shine through. Plot and character development are both strong and ""Murder in Four Part Harmony"" is a real pleasure to read. Most fascinating is the peek the author gives us into that part of the gospel music world that most of us would not suspect exists and, yet, this still qualifies as a ""traditional"" mystery. This is one I can easily recommend to a reader looking for a new mystery author and I'm looking forward to the next one."
5,Good reading!!!,"The book is well written and insightful!!! Take the time to read it, and you definitely won't be disappointed!!!"
4,A cozy look the world of gospel music,"Murder in Four Part Harmony is an excellent read. I was impressed with the author's crisp writing. It is a first novel and once in a while that shows, but it has plot, interesting characters, a setting I didn't already know, and what every mystery needs--suspense. I look forward her continuing writing career.In another life, some thirty years or so ago, I was a church librarian, and had to really hunt to find good books which fit the expectations of the patrons. Where was Lorie when I needed her? Not born, probably, but I am trying to say that her book meets a very real need."
4,Good for recreational use,"This glove is great for casual softball games at the park with friends and family. It is a good value for the cost. If you are playing in a rec league or more cometative league, get a higher quality glove. Also, if you have large hands/long fingers, you may want to get a different glove. I have very long fingers and the glove is a tad small for me.Overall, great glove for the price for low-key softball playing and playing catch."
3,good glove,Good glove for the low end cheap price range. It does its job. I don't really like the elastic strap in the back of the glove. Seems like that will wear/tear fairly quickly after frequent use.
4,Great Glove for the Price - BAD Amazon listing.,"Great glove for the price, though I can't use it (this is where my complaint comes in).As to how Amazon lists the item should be clearer if it's for the right of left hand. As of the time I purchased this glove, they don't really make it clear if it's for the right hand or left hand, instead they used Right Orientation or Left Orientation. Which means what? Does it mean if I would wear the glove on my right or left hand? Or does it mean if I throw with my left or right hand? Thinking the obvious that it would be asking where I would wear the glove I purchased the LEFT orientation. There you have it a glove for my RIGHT hand :(For those people reading this. I'm not a ball player so I wasn't familiar how they used the ""orientation"" term in describing baseball gloves. I just wanted to play catch with my daughter.Good new thought. Amazon did update the listing to say RIGHT/LEFT HAND THROW. But you'll only see this info in your cart."
4,Good Value,"This is not one of those plastic gloves that will never break in. As soon as I pulled it out of the box it had movement and flexibility. I put a little oil in the palm and it's perfect. Deep pocket and padded palm makes it great for outfield play. Like I said, not one of those plastic gloves. I am happy with my purchase."
3,glove wilson from venezuela,"I do not think outside the glove 13 ""seemed rather 12.5, but very good glove, but I thought it was full of leather .. Only thing I dislike is that the glove said it was made in china? I'm buying this glove you is because I understood that is made in United States. I hope it will last quite gloves because multiple orders. but that they are made in china I don't like. The Chinese are very very thieves and imitators. do everything without synthetic life. I hope not mistaken. thanks"
2,A bit misleading,"The pictures were a bit misleading, and did not show the inside of the mitt, where it had ""softball"", in big letters, printed. This was not a baseball glove, it was clearly meant to be a softball glove. Glove was brand new though, and was shipped promptly. Should have done more research myself, but this was misleading."
5,quality and price,"I recently moved to a new area and church. After playing many years of baseball, I was thrilled that this church has a softball league. Having one child and another on the way, money is tight, but I needed a softball glove. I did some shopping and came back to this glove on Amazon. I rec'd the day of our first game and it has performed well since. Great price and great performance."
2,"okay for beginners,","This would be a pretty okay glove for a first-timer or something, but I would NOT recommend it for a competitive player or anything. It'll probably rip in a week. I only bought it as a really last minute glove because I couldn't find any others and it was cheap. And I've been using it for one softball season and it hasn't been broken it yet, but it's already ripping.Now I have a mizuno glove like before, and its amazing.=]"
1,Very Poor,"I lost my glove last weekend so decided to buy another Wilson since the last one performed well. When I opened up the package I was surprised that the glove was smaller the my wife's 12.5"" wilson glove even though it had 13"" stamped on the inseam. What the..? Be careful buying this glove..it is NOT 13"", more like 12"" or under. Looked like a little league glove. The glove was also VERY stiff and hard. After paying extra for 2nd day shipping I ended up buying a glove at Sports Authority. Won't buy a glove online again."
2,Basic Indeed,"There's no effort to hide the fact that this book is basic, but perhaps it's too basic. The authors scurry through the full set of design principles, but often move too fast and touch too superficially to allow for real learning. Deeper analysis of the basics, substituting thoughtful examples and exercises for the many one-liners, would make this more helpful. On the other hand, it's probably useful for the part-time desktop publisher who needs to browse three ""sample brochures"" before four p.m. and couldn't care less about theory."
1,beautiful pictures little theory,"I thought the book would have been more detailed. There are very beautiful pictures in it but as for the theory there's almost nothing. I would have liked more specific information about visual merchandising: for example how to create good window cases or in store displays. Also a defined visual merchandising strategy could have been mentioned.Overall, I'm a quite disappointed with the book."
3,It's ok...,"I bought this presenter a while back when it was on sale($50). When it works it is great.Pros:-looks great-works smoothly(when it works)Cons:-can't be paired with a different Bluetooth receiver(don't lose the dongle!!!)-battery life is so so-every now and then I have to keep pairing it with the dongle, push button on dongle then presenter, really annoying during presentationsIMO save your money and get an RF 2.4ghz one instead of this one."
3,Cachaca,The Digital Music Disc which I have purchased was well described.However I would recommend Adding an actual recorded music demonstration that would anable me to listen to the music disc before deciding about a procurment.
3,On the Texas Border,I'm not a big Harelequinn Romance novel reader but I saw this and thought I'd give it an try. To my surprise it was a much better than I had imagined. This book was interesting and came with an unpredictable twist.
5,"Informative, exceptionally well presented, timeline history.","This survey of the history of exploration provides an excellent chronological coverage which pairs biographies of the sailors involved with details of the voyages they undertook and the ships they used. Maps, color illustrations and charts provide a fine timeline of events and dates."
4,useful book with minor flaws,"As a Social Studies teacher I found this book useful and informative. I like the charts and maps and the information is well organized. I was surprised at information left out that would create a clearer picture of who these explorers were. For example, we learn that a crew member on Columbus's ship spotted land first but not that Columbus took the credit and the reward.We learn that La Navidad is destroyed and the settlers killed but not that the settlers were cutting off the hands of the Indians who didn't bring gold."
5,Mulan Doll,I am not a kid and my boyfriend bought this for me. I really love it because whenever I was little this was my favorite doll. It is an absolutely gorgeous doll. I would recommend this to any girl any age. So happy :)
3,basically works,"Basically works. The lights are dim and hard to see during the day, they are OK at night. Took some fiddling to get the unit to engage in the cig lighter power source. Get's a good grade for price and simplicity of operation."
3,good device,The Nokia handsfree bluetooth device is a good one.It's ease of use and operation is great. The Quality of the incoming call volume is okay. the out going call and functions of the device are all good but the incoming calls should have a better sound quality. The user friendly calling features and the ease of operation are very good as well.The incoming Call volume the voice or rather reception is poor there is no adjustment for call volume that improves the quality of incoming calls.
3,Convenient but not perfect,"This speakerphone is very easy to set up and convenient to use. Because it is just plugged into the cigarette lighter it is on whenever the ignition is on and you never have to worry about charging it. It does have to be located wherever your lighter socket is, so it wouldn't work on some cars, but works fine on both cars I tried it on. It is easy to hear, but the microphone is a little weak, and of course your voice fades if you look to the left while talking."
2,Speaker power too low,This works very well with my Nokia N75 but the speaker power is too weak when I'm driving my noisy Mustang GT. It's little bit strange because from 12V battery you should able to get 3-4W to 8 Ohm speaker. I'm going to open the case and change speaker driver if possible.I think that this is not Nokia design because usually they do not design or manufacture any accessories. Usually Nokia specifies everything very carefully to OEM manufacturers so I'm surprised to see that output power of speaker is too low for real application.UPDATE: HF-33W died just two weeks after warranty expired. Great!!!
2,Bluetooth connection weak...sound OK,"There are better units out there. I am returning this. What a headache! The bluetooth connection with my Razr kept dropping, sound when connected was not very clear. I'm trying the BlueAnt."
4,Good piece of equipment,"Reasonably priced, well built and small in size. Audio - incoming and outgoing is OK, however, perhaps because loudspeaker is too small, the maximum volume attainable in rather low."
5,Excellent,"This collection of fifteen short stories features characters from Kage Baker's Company novels, including Mendoza, Joseph, Lewis, and the mysterious Alec Chesterfield. I really don't know how she does it - each story is entertaining, the world-building is splendid, and her characters are wonderful. I especially love the thread of dark humor that runs through her books. I hope she keeps writing for many years to come."
4,Works,"Nothing is more infuriating than the sound of a cat taking a piddle on your floor at 2 am. Litter magnet works wonders for my ""little pee-er"" when it's used in a litter he likes. There are some litters he won't use and this won't help. But he willingly goes in the box of litter he likes when there is litter magnet there.The product smells a bit woodsy, but is not unpleasant. There is a lot in the container (thank goodness, it's not cheap!). I rarely use the full amount that's called for.Good luck!"
4,On My favorite Villan,"I loved Othello . Next to Hamlet it catches the attention and the heart of the reader . This play wraps one up in the world Shakespere recreated of Love Hate Lust Desire and Greed . I say Read it , think about it Tell a friend . I was especailly touched by the actions of Iago. Even though he was Evil incarnate one can find a little of him everywhere . Still this cant compare to the effect the drama gives one if they view it being preformed firsthand."
4,"Othello is Othello, but not my favorite edition","Pros:It's still Othello. There's nothing to say about it. It is in its most glorious unaltered form. The story as a whole is not bad. I have read it multiple times, but it never seems to get old. It is one of the most fun to read Shakespeares in my opinion. With that being said, it is also among the easier of his works. There are a lot of similes and metaphors that are used throughout the book to represent such grand topics such as race, status, and leadership.Cons:This is definitely not my favorite edition. I have used the Folger edition before and I much prefer that one to this one. It has much more interesting/informative notes and has better definitions/pictures that can be extremely helpful to understanding the text itself."
1,Does anyone else notice the voice??????,This cracked me up so much. I just watched five minutes of this movie and realized the lead character's voice is overdubbed by someone else. It's not even Jennifer Love Hewitt's voice! Hilarious and that should give you a hint of what watching this horrible movie is like. They should play this movie to the prisoners in Guantanamo as a torture tactic- who needs waterboarding.
1,Not for me,"I tried, BUT, I couldn't watch more than 10 minutes of this movie. Free is too much for my time. It was not for me. Sorry. Next!"
2,"So Many Sexy Outfits, So Little Time","`Confessions of a Sociopathic Social Climber' is an '05 made-for-television feature promoted as a ""social satire"" (an attempt at relvance I guess). Unfortunately it's nothing more than an excuse to film Jennifer Love Hewitt in as many revealing outfits as possible within a limited amount of time.Plot: Katya Livingston (Jennifer) is a beautiful but obnoxious, self-centered ad executive who lies, cheats and sleeps her way up the social ladder. Aided by her flamboyant best friend Ferguson (Joey Lawrence) she worms her way through the film reeking havoc wherever she goes.Jennifer is unquestionably a very attractive young lady and I'll be the first to admit that just knowing she's in a film is enough to peek my interest, however even the lovely Jennifer cannot save this one. This movie is shallow, silly and predictable. It receives -2 Stars- instead of -1- simply because she's sooo easy on the eyes."
1,Dumb and too predictable,"Really low budget, predictable, bad acting. Some of the scenes looked like they were from 1990. I wouldn't waste your time with this one."
1,worst movie,"the worst movie, whatever - comedy - I do not get it. what is all about in this movie?the actress is bad, the movie is stupid, and so on"
2,There must be like a million better things to do in one and a half hours,"This is what I think of it: Bad movie, bad acting. Boring story. Sometimes it is even ridiculous and not because they try."
4,You must be able to relate...,"This move was a fave of mine because I totally relate!! Anyone else that I know that loves this movie is also someone that can relate to the lifestyle.A person that would do anything to be at the top of the ladder, in the know with ""the top people"", wearing THE best everything etc.I love this movie!!"
4,Jennifer Love Hewitt is adorable in this,"fun, silly, watchable film. You know an actor has talent whena character they portray has few redeemable traits, but yet, you still root for them.Katya is a social climber and will do most anything to get to an invitation only ball.The best part of this film for me was JLH character's narration. She has to keep track of all herexpenses for her tax man. While doing so she pretty much ends up witha daily diary of her life. Naughty, silly, charming fun. I rented it and plan to buy it for a pick meup sometime when I am blue."
2,Really Weak,"The only reason I rented this DVD was for Jennifer Love Hewitt. I'm a big fan of her, both as an actress and as a singer. But even she couldn't save this film from sub par status. Jennifer plays a very self centered employee of an advertising agency (she lies about her credentials to get the job), whose number one goal is to become a popular socialite. She falls in love with an attorney who likes her but is turned off by her stuck up persona. She eventually dumps the fake attitude to win the guy over. Jennifer is too sweet of an actress to do a credible job playing a ""bad girl."" But even despite that fact, the film is slow moving, very predictable, and just plain boring. Unless you are a diehard Jennifer Love Hewitt fan, I wouldn't waste your time."
3,One flaw,"These silicone baking dishes are great except for one flaw that can be major or minor depending on your personal use: You can't cut anything in these pans. If you like to make brownies and cut them while they are still in the pan, forget it with these, because the knife will cut right through the pan."
4,My first silicone bakeware experience is OK.,"Pan arrived today. Washed it, sprayed with canola oil, and baked Marie Calendar's ""instant"" corn bread in my toaster oven. Put this pan on a baking tray for support. Lowered the temperature by 25 deg. The recipe said bake 30-35 min, and it was ready in 30 minutes. Slight sticking when I attempted to invert the pan, so I cut the pieces with nylon spatula while still in the pan. No sticking this way. The silicone did emit a slight odor when baking."
1,Do not trust this company,"False advertising. Apparently, ""plates,"" really means ""plate."" I was really excited about finding such a good deal on bumper plates until I received one plate in the mail. Buying an actual set of plates from this vender will run you about $80 including shipping; there are better deals out there- not to mention venders with more integrity."
5,Amazing Descriptions of Higher state of Consciousness,"I have been reading about and studying higher states of consciousness for 30 years, and in all that time I have never read such personal, detailed, in depth descriptions of experiences of Unity Consciousness. Almaas has an amazing facility to describe profoundly subtle experiences. His descriptions are consistent with classical descriptions of that state, yet at the same time he adds an element of examining his own ""ego structures"" in the light of the Untiy experiences. If you are into this type of thing, this is a truely facinating book."
5,Wealth of Information,This book was well worth buying. It has a wealth of information on the subject. It also has beautiful photos that inspire.
1,tre,"I was buying this as a gift. I thought since it was beging sold through Amazon that it would be new. Shame on me. The name of a library is stamped into it as well as having a page cut out. Had I bought it for myself, there were certainly more inexpensive copies available."
1,Not same as pictured,"The photo shows the buckle design and camouflage finish. I received the velcro design in black finish. I bought this as a back-up, and love the way the Little Bitty Goose shoots--but it should have been clear in the description what the buyer was getting.I will be sending it back."
4,Somewhat Misleading,"The c-light itself works fine and is bright and comes with mounting options that make it useable on any PFD, BUT...for it to qualify under USCG 161.012 it must be powered by lithium batteries, a fact not made known in advertisements or promotions for it. The lithium battery requirement IS stated on the packaging for the light, but of course the only way one can see that is after one has already bought it. Kind of a bait-and-switch since the c-light is advertised at the lowest price but then the buyer is hit with the additional cost for the lithium batteries. Customers would be better served if Amazon and its suppliers would fully disclose such requirements in their advertising for items."
1,Piece of junk,"About 6 hours delay every 24 hours, it will never gives you the correct time.Don't buy it.The radio is working fine though."
1,step up!,"If you are looking for FRS 2-way radio, consider models with 14x38 channels as air is saturated with users in areas where you gonna use it -- ski slops, ships, parks etc. 14 channels doesn't give enough options, so with this radio you will listen to conversations of others!To consider: 1) audiovox (model with 14x38 channels) 2) higher end Cobra with 14x38"
2,Good for the kids,This radio is good for the kids. The am/fm provides options not available on all other such devices. It has a flexible antenna and includes a belt clip. I found the buttons somewhat difficult to push and the case a bit slippery. The serious user will want rubberized grips. Overall a good value.
4,Bauhaus Basics,"I think Kandinsky's books are a little better than Itten. But this is one of Itten's best for sure. There are lots of images but not much text. The typography, ironically, is not laid out well and not very big. But the images go well with what the content states and gives the reader a view into the Bauhaus class structure."
4,great jams mixed with weaker tunes,"The Fatback Band tend to get lost in the R&B/Funk music shuffle, but they were a very tight band and released a lot of mighty fine music. It wasn't all geared to the dance floor, but that's definitely the inspiration for many tracks on here. If you enjoyed any of the Fatback Band's music over the years --- and we're talking mostly early 1970s to early 80s --- or like 70s soul/funk/dance music, you'll find a lot to like on this generous 2-CD collection. Some great instrumental jams and funky vocal tunes (both male and female vocalist) are included, but there are also a few weaker, repititious dance tunes that haven't stood the test of time very well. Thankfully, the really good stuff far outweighs the few clunkers, so I think this set is well worth the money. You get so many more songs than what the single disc ""Best of"" contains."
4,Basketball Lover,My son loves this game just for the simple fact that it is Basketball. And he loves that you can play the actual real teams.
3,Older verision,Sorry to say that I didn't realize this product does not work with Windows XP. My students have a more recent version and love it. Wish we could use it cuz the kiddos love thinkin things.
5,Rat Pack Collection,"The Rat Pack Collection is a must for enthusiasts of Franks posse. The three movies amply display all of the coolness and talent of this amazing cast of heavyweights. If you like Frank, and Dean and Sammie you must buy this collection."
3,Better for beginners,"I would say this is a great book for someone with no experience or is just out of grooming school. However, for someone like me who has been grooming for 7 years it was not helpful. I feel that most experienced groomers already use the techniques approached in this book. I was really looking forward to more photos instead of the drawings. I do applaud the effort that Ms. Thompson put into writing it. If you are a beginner, buy this book but If you are confidant in your grooming skills, save your money."
4,"Great in places, a good and handy guide.","This book was almost but not quite what I expected. I thought there would be a little more information on the grooming and styling of basic 'mutts' rather than a concentration of styles on a small group of dogs. However, it is highly informative, gives precise and clear guides to achieving varying styles and is well worth it's four star rating."
3,Great for playing around with but not serious 2 way's,These cobras are a graet deal for the money but don't expect to use them for more than a mile in a city. The interference is bad after a mile. I thought that since eveything on them was digital they would be cool except the volume at the lowest setting is still loud enough to hear by someone one else. Finally don't plan on going anywhere where a lot of people will be using them cause there are no privacy codes and believe me I know now it is worth it to get them with the privacy codes. So overall they are great for the money with the rebate but if I were you i would splurge and go for the privacy codes.
2,Very disappointed,"I'm quite disappointed in the performance. We got these radios, opened them up, put in the batteries, and the first one worked perfectly, but.... the second of the two ""static-free"" had nothing but static until you keyed the talk button. We couldn't even leave it on because even on the #1 setting of volume, it was very loud and annoying! I certainly hope I can get this problem resolved with the company or I'm definately going to want my money back!"
1,DON'T BUY IT,"BECAUSE OF AN ILL FAMILY MEMBER, I MUST LEAVE THE 2-WAY RADIO ON ALL NIGHT. THE STATIC WAKES ME UP. ALSO, BATTERIES HAVE TO BE REPLACED TOO OFTEN. THE ON-OFF BUTTON IS DIFFICULT FOR SENIOR CITIZENS TO USE."
3,Wrong picture,I was expecting a hook style release but the Scott Archery Little Goose release is NOT hook style. The picture is of a hook style release. It is still a good release though so i wont give it 1 star.
2,WRONG ONE,"I ORDERED A SCOTT RELEASE CAMO WHICH WAS ON THE PICTURE, RECEIVED A BLACK ONE. I SENT IT BACK AND RECEIVED THE SAME THING."
3,Wrong release,The picture doesn't match the item that you will get. Its show to be a buckle strap release but it's a Velcro strap release instead. The picture needs to match the product that is being sold instead of fooling people.
1,Don't waste your time,"This book was very easy to finger out. I like to ""The other side of dark"" better b/c it wasn't as easy to finger out. The character Marti is way to emotional in this book."
1,Dont Read This Book,"I really disliked this book. The main Character, Marti, was WAY too emotional and melodrematic. Every little thing that happend, she freaked out. The ending sucked. So PLEASE do NOT read this atrocious book."
5,Suspencful Silent Screams,I could not put down this book! It was great. It kept me on my toes of trying to figure out who did it. I hope you will agree with me saying that this is certainly a good book.
1,Please spare yourself,"I did not enjoy the company of this book. It was to emotional and to dramatic. The character,plot and actions were to PREDICTIBLE!!!!!. And it was bad, bad, badok your welcome"
3,A well told tale,"This book like all of Joan Lowery Nixon's books was a thriller. Although, I believe that this wasn't one of her best books. The ending , which I am not going to tell, is dissapointing. The suspense builds until the ending of the book, and all of a sudden THATS IT the books over. I feel that she needed more detal in this book in the manner that she needed feelings, character description, and plot description. Over all , this book was better then worse, it had some good suspense parts, and great characters. The plot was also so-so."
4,I read this in 8th Grade,"I really liked this book so much so that I read just about every book she'd written at the time. Some of the other reviews on here say her books seem like the same story with different characters, this is true. But, that is what I liked about her writing. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is past middle school age since it might bore them."
1,Secret Silent Screams,"This book was a good book. I thought that it had good suspense and I enjoyed it. In my opinion, this was her best book that Joan Lowery Nixon wrote. If you like scary stories, and are into suspense, get this book."
4,Troy Hill at it's finest,"I grew up on Mt. Troy but went to school at Most Holy Name Elementary. I married my husband of 40 yrs who lived on Troy Hill. I was in the same class as Sarah Wohleber. And yet I never knew these wonderful women existed on Troy Hill. This book was given to me by my sister-in-law who also grew up on Troy Hill. Unless you understand the diversity of Pittsburgh and the nationality division, you cannot appreciate this book. The north side had the Italians on the lower side and Germans on the upper side. The South side had the Polish and Slavic nationalities. The Hill side had the black population and the rest fell in the cracks. These women as in all the neighborhoods of Pittsburgh kept it together like glue. It is an extremely well written book and captures one little niche of an amazing city of cultural pride."
2,Not What I Expected.......,"Maybe it was the writer's fault, but this story just wasn't presented the way I thought it would be. It turned out to be more of a travelogue of this little neighborhood than individual stories about the ladies themselves. I couldn't finish it."
3,No Close Caption,"Was excited to see this final on DVD, but was very disappointed that it doesn't have closed caption. It is widescreen, and quality is fair, a bit grainy on HD. Also beware that it may not work on all players or PC for playback"
2,Bad Sound,"The movie is excellent but the sound track very bad, The dialogue is inaudible unless the volume is turned very high. Very disappointing. A poorly made recording."
5,bought as a gift,they loved it - funny collectors item and they were very happy to accept this as a gift - well done they said
3,Cold Comfort,"I love this film, so my rating is really just a review of the DVD. Despite the fact that the case says ""full screen"", this movie is presented as mentioned on here in what I presume is 1:85/1. While it doesn't present a HUGE improvement over the old VHS framing, it does allow you to see the credits, which the previous version did not. The movie doesn't appear to have been restored in any meaningful way, but it is much clearer than the VHS release. I suspect that the production values were never especially sophisticated, so I didn't expect it to look like a classic Hollywood film. I don't have the laserdisc release so I don't know if this is simply a DVD issue of that transfer. While I would much rather have a pressed commercial DVD release, I'm glad to finally have this movie on DVD and can now retired my old videotape to the trash."
4,"Funny movie, just as I remembered it...","I remember seeing this movie on TV when I was a kid in the 70's and always remembered it being incredibly funny. Watched it again for the first time in years and it was as funny as I remembered it! The scenes where the townspeople are all going through withdrawal are priceless with arguably the best collection of comedic actors of that generation in one movie(just TRY not to laugh during Tom Poston's drunken monologue!). It's not a perfect movie, maybe a bit dated, and some of the characters ( especially the pastor's wife, played by Pippa Scott) could have been given more to do, but it's a great movie nonetheless.Could it be remade today? Possibly, but then again they would probably cast Adam Sandler in the Bob Newhart role which would ruin the movie right there (along with a collection of excrement jokes because nobody can figure out how to write comedy without them anymore)"
5,cold turkey,just great like to be able to see it again after all theis year was funnywas glad to be able to get it
5,A forgotten Movie,I really like this film. All kinds of comedy actors in it that I remember only after seeing the movie. This is a Norman Lear film. It even has Edith Bunker in it from All In The Family. The movie has a real 1971 feel to it.
1,Don't buy this one!,The audio on the Cold Turkey custom DVD is embarrasing! I'm impressed any audio technician was willing to let this product out to market. The music and effects track sound as if the mag track was sliding on and off the playback head making the effect of being underwater. Perhaps the original track was damaged over time but in that case they would have done better to pull a copy of the composite soundtrack off a VHS tape. Pity because the picture quality is quite good. I guess I'll just keep my VHS and toss this copy out. Maybe something better will show up later.
4,A neglected classic of American cinematic comedy.,"Tom Poston's performance as the town drunk is alone worth the price of admission, but there's lots more here, from Edward Everett Horton's last performance to a wonderfully hyper Bob Newhart, lots of great cameos, and even Bob & Ray. It ""gives us all its love."""
2,It's Not Anamorphic! Beware!,"I just don't understand why any studio would release a film today that was lensed in widescreen (1.85:1 or greater) in non-anamorphic mode. Most people, especially those who collect older titles, have widescreen televisions. This one appears as a small box in the middle of the screen. Does it cost more to transfer a widescreen movie in anamorphic mode so that it fills today's screens?Very dissapointed, but MGM is great for doing this. I bet the upcoming re-re-release of Elvis Presley's ""Clambake"" will be non-anamorphic too. So beware, unless you like looking at a little picture surrounded by black on a big screen."
3,Space Shuttle,My five-year-old has enjoyed this toy but it's a little fragile and has required glue in several places so we frequently have to remind him not to pick it up and throw it when it's time to put it away. So far nothing has broken that we weren't able to glue back on.
3,Not worth $100,"This was an average movie, overall, but it had it's moments. What really makes the movie work isn't the action or even the plot, although those pass. It's the human drama, what a dedicated cop winds up doing when she is faced with temptation.So, you don't want to know what happens in the movie, you just want to watch it. You'll follow a female cop on a murder investigation. You might find that it's a little long, too. It ain't over 'til it's over, but I don't think I could watch the whole thing more than once every few years. Not without getting stoned anyway, as this is a sleeper. But despite all that, the drama left a lasting impression with me."
2,A Waste of time and Money,"This movie had no plot, but Joan Severance has a nice body and is a decent actress. I could not figure anything else out about it. It reminded me of a another Shannon Tweed film, so that's why it sucked."
2,Abstract and Ambiguous,"Begins with a good deal of meaningful intrigue and promise of a formidable mystery, but gradually erodes into a surreal farce. Hence, there is no believable plot to hold your interest, and the characters themselves seem to be behaving in some random purposeless fashion. Do not recommend except for those who may enjoy abstract ambiguous foreign films."
3,sunshine frustration,with so many unexpected angles and blocking - its obvious that no one directs like Alain Resnais - his name in the credits is the signal for a visual feast - the result of his directorial choices - along with the stunning use of color and lighting - for which - equal shares of credit go to cinematographer Eric Gautier and production designer Jacques Saulnier - and many other behind the scenersand i mustnt forget how he brings out the best in his actors - here - with half of his old - in both senses of the word - team - Sabine Azéma and André Dussollieras usual - the story is laid back and airy - tho this is probably less logically constructed then other Resnais films that i have seen - yet he manages to blend the surreal nature of the story with a down to earth qualityenjoy the sunshine lushness - and the quirky performances - even tho the unfolding events may ultimately frustrate you
4,how does it end?,"It's about a lady who gets mugged for her purse. A man finds her wallet and turns it in to the police who return it to the lady. She thanks the man. He thinks she is not thanking him enough. He wants more thanking and she wants to hear less from him. He's actually a sweet old guy, you think at first. But is he really? I first saw this movie on a plane. Unfortunately, we landed before I could see how the movie ends. So I bought it to finally see the end. No spoiler alert here. You'll have to watch it yourself to see. Oh yes, the director is one of the greatest filmakers in France, famous for thi sly and sophisticated who-done-its."
2,Love Resnais but disappointed in this film,"I love Resnais' film and when I heard about this one (and the awards it received) I was eager to see it. I agree with the previous reviewer that there is some great cinematography here and some intriguing aspects to the film but the characters make so little sense that it moves beyond absurdist or surreal to meaningless. In Marienbad, it was clear that one would never get to the truth but here some similiar threads just seem forced and pointless. Disappointing."
2,"Story is not interesting enough, but the cinematography is beautiful","The cinematography is really really beautiful, so I am sad to say that the story lags far behind in quality. You don't know where the story is going so it does keep you interested for a while. Ultimately I found the story a let-down.After watching the film I read the NYT review and the following statement made me think: ""To put it baldly, it is a dialogue between the ego and the rampaging id, without the attachment of moral or psychoanalytic baggage."" Had I watched the film with this framing it would have been a bit more interesting."
3,Creative filmmaking with a bit of a let down at the end,"""Wild Grass"" really, really, really looked like it was going somewhere interesting and then...not. Marvelous, creative film-making with some very interesting and well-realized characters. And the disappointment doesn't come until late in the film which is well worth seeing despite the let down."
3,Cute but fell apart,"These were really cute but didn't last long. They were too big for my keys but I left them on and used them anyway. Soon they started to tear and finally, broke and fell off."
2,Unreal and corny story,This was the first book I've read by this author and it will probably be the last. I read to the finish because it was easy reading but the storyline was so corny.
2,A bit of a disappointment,"Believe it or not, I found this SEP book a drag. The storyline was unreal and I found the First Lady, Nealy, quite silly. Not much happens in this book to keep that emotional intensity found in Dream a Little Dream. Reread one of the old favorites 'cos that's what I'm going to do to remind myself SEP is one of the best authors. I hope her next book is 90% better. I don't want to loose the faith."
3,interesting but not unforgettable,"I did enjoy this novel. However I felt the characters lacked some of the pizzazz of some of her previous works. It is not one of her best, but good for a rainy afternoon. I hope her next novel offers a little more of her traditional spirit, humor, and passion."
3,Not up to her usual calibre,"I was SO anxious for this book to come out and was very disappointed to find it not near as entertaining as her previous books. I've read all of them and this book just didn't seem to have the sparkling wit and character depth her other books have. I won't be less inclined to buy any of her future work, but I didn't have any trouble at all letting this book out of my collection of 'keepers'."
3,It was Okay,"This book started off well and I liked the characters very much. Without trying to give anything away, I was very disappointed with the ending. I know this is fiction, but get real! How is anyone supposed to believe this would really happen!"
1,not worth the price...,"this book was extremely corny, did not really enjoy it, try some of her earlier books..."
2,Definitely not her best,"I couldn't wait to get this book. I began reading it right away. I kept reading hoping it would pick up. It didn't. I usually love SEP's work. The characters are usually so compelling that you can picture them,laugh, and cry with them. Not so in First lady. SEP has another book coming out in 2000 hopefully that one will be much better. I just found this book flat. Definitely not a book that I would reread unless I was stuck in an airport with nothing else to do."
3,"good, but not as good as dream a little dream","First Lady was a good read. Better than Lady Be Good, but not half as entertaining or moving as Phillips bestseller, Dream a Little Dream, nor as funny as Heaven, Texas. Mat has a major chip on his shoulder (of course), but melts under the charm and zest of Nealy and baby Button (who created the lightest moments in the book) Would have liked to see more of Nealy's father and his reaction to the whole escape. The trek across middle America helps move the book along quite well, and I got a kick out of the characters they meet along the way. I was anxiously awaiting First Lady, and was mildly disappointed. But i don't regret rushing out to buy it the minute it hit the stores."
5,Seriously Addictive,"The first book I ever read of SEP's was Nobody's Baby But Mine, and I've been hooked ever since. But this novel, a wonderful story of how confining the pressure of the public spotlight can be, was more than just great. It is romantic storywriting at it's finest.Nealy is a character you can relate to, and Mat has just enough flaws to make him memorable. But it was the addition of the children to the melting pot that gave the story it's heart.You can begin to feel the desperation and drama, and yet to say that SEP didn't have as much humor in this book is a serious miscalculation. There are just too many scenes where these characters find themselves in situations so hilarious, I had a hard time stifling my giggles.First Lady keeps you guessing, and is not in the least predictable. This story was like chocolate. I couldn't get enough. And neither will you. My only regret is waiting a WHOLE YEAR for the next one!"
1,The worst SEPs has written,When I heard of the soon release of this book I could hardly wait for it's arrival but was highly dissapointed after reading it. I have read every book by SEPs and she is by far my favorite romance author of all time--but this was very different from her other books--her other books usually have a story line and the characters aren't dull but interesting and usually keep you up till 3 a.m. wanting to finish it....this one made you want to go to bed and try to figure out in the morning how to try to return it to the book store..... Can't wait for next book though!
1,Disappointed,"I've enjoyed several of Ms. Phillips' books and expected to enjoy this one. Sadly, the best part of the book was the endnote indicating that her next book would be about return characters Kevin the football player and Molly, from ""It Had to Be You"". I'd give this one a pass."
4,"A True Fantasy....Oh, but what a Wonderful One!","The First Lady is a modern day romance about a widow of the assignated president who is forced to stay on as First Lady to a new single president. She kind of comes across as being weak and being manipulated by her father and the new president....but then she decides she is tired of it and runs away. She does everything right and then gets careless and has her car stolen...in walks Mat, Button, and Lucy....the adventure begins....this is a story of a courageous woman who needs time to ""find herself"""
5,FUN READ,"This was a very entertaining book to read. Would love to see it played out on TV or movie. With the right people, it could be a good comedy."
3,Farfetched!,"I enjoy SEP's books greatly, but this one was a little too farfetched for my taste. The ending is completely at odds with the main character's motivations and feelings in the remainder of the book. I could not identify with Nealy and her situation at all. Matt, on the other hand....yum!"
2,Uninspired,"Having enjoyed other books by SEP, I couldn't wait to read ""First Lady"". Unfortunately this book is not in the same league as others by this author.The lead characters aren't very compelling or particularly well drawn. Something about their relationship didn't ring true. It somehow seemed ""flat"". The best characters in this book are the kids. I was completely charmed by Lucy and Button.If you want to read a good book by SEP, skip ""First Lady"" and pick up ""Heaven, Texas"", ""It Had to be You"" or ""Dream a Little Dream""."
4,Good read,"Enjoyed this book - but not my favorite Susan Elizabeth Phillips book. Wanted to read it to get the back story on the other two stories with connecting characters.I always enjoy her writing, realistic dialogue and strong women."
2,Not thrilling AT ALL!,"OK, review no 83, nobody's gonna read this, but I just had to, if only to express my profound disappointment that one of the greatest authors in romance is losing her touch. Really, the storyline was borderline believable and the end was ridiculous, sorry. Also, the characters were lacking the warmth of earlier characters. Nealy's just so indecisive, does she want to be free or trapped, picky or loosened up. And honestly, for a woman who wants a normal life, she certainly is right up the wrong path of life... Sadly, I hated this book, it didn't give me goose bumps (except for the kid episodes, which were great. The kids are really the book's stars) and that is so unusual for an SEP book. Thank God the book she is promising for next year sounds like a pure winner! Two very much loved characters hitting it off sounds like a lot of fun, sort of ""Heaven Texas"" meets ""Lady be Good"" although hopefully at last with an original storyline."
2,"Disappointing, buy something else","I was happy to start in on a new Phillips but was very disappointed, very soon. The book starts out good but fizzles soon thereafter.Nealy/Nell, the lead character just isn't believable a third of the way through. The teenage character got on my nerves. If you like fine dialogue like ""I'm gonna hurl"" or ""This blows"" maybe you'll disagree.It seems like there was a good outline for the book but the pressures of a deadline or maybe just plain apathy resulted in shortcuts in character development and plot.I wouldn't spend any money on this one. Reread ""Lady Be Good"" or ""Heaven, Texas""."
2,Rather Disappointed,"First Lady was a disappointment to me. Some of the plotdevicesto move it along were too incredible. The sex was extremely tepid.It was an easy read and was interesting in stretches, particularly the descriptions of life at the White House. Coming after some really great SEP romances, it definitely was a disappointment. I love to re-read my favorites, but First Lady will not get one. END"
4,"A funny, touching story of family life.","The characters in this story are believable, although I had trouble identifying with the First Lady of the U.S. The kids are wonderful, funny well developed characters and the story seemed more about them than about the hero and heroine. Although the book is a great read, I didn't feel quite as much emotion in the love story as I did in SEP's previous books. Still highly recommended."
5,Another winner from SEP,"I was up until 1:30 this morning finishing FIRST LADY. Wow, it left me awed. The characters were something else--three dimensional, very very real characters with dialogue and emotions true to life. There were very funny moments--the kids, the heroine's ""pregnancy,"" the hero's thoughts on life with females. Yep, very funny. But there was also a very clear view of what life is like for America's First Lady. My respect for each of those ladies and all to come has definitely rose to a high level--especially for Hillary, poor woman. It's a tough, very thankless job. Thanks, Susan, for making me laugh, for making me cry, and for making me think."
2,What a disappointment,"With great anticipation I bought this as we were heading to Florida on vacation. Because I was so certain it would be as wonderful as all of SEPs novels, I saved it for last.How sad that I should've read it first, just to get finished with it. I found Mat and Nealy to be not only underdeveloped, but lacking any of the sympathetic qualities I have come to expect from this author. They were, sadly, flat and annoying. The notable exceptions were the children, Lucy and Button who, like most children in SEPs novels, were delightful.While I certainly applaud the attempt to try a new kind of character, I look forward to Phillips' next novel."
2,"not awful, but not her best","This book was by no means her best work. The romance wasn't believeable nor were many of Ms. Phillips' political ideas. I usually love her novels (especially Dream a Little Dream and Heaven, Texas) but this was not even in the same league. The most excited I got about the book was the ad for her next book in the back!"
4,"Good book, poor epilogue","SEP offers nice escapism and fun. This implausible story is fun and sparks the reader's imagination. Nealy and Mat were great, but I especially enjoyed Lucy; SEP did a good job of getting the sullen, but loving, teen ""just right."" The epilogue wasn't believable at all. I doubt a person who ran from the ""fish bowl"" existence of First Lady would actively pursue the office of President later."
5,I loved everything about this book!,"I've read almost all of SEP's books and this has to be one of my favorites. At first I thought the concept of the story was a little unbelievable, but this author pulls it off. Nealy is a good heroine, but I was extremely impressed with Mat. I liked his big-guy hot temper, but soft heart. All the secondary characters are good. This will definitely go on my re-read list."
4,Some good stuff,"I was pretty surprised with this book. After reading the synopsis online, i was a little skeptic. After all, we're talking about the first lady running away and the people she's with don't figure it out? that's kinda stupid. But i'm an avid reader of Susan Elizabeth Phillips and she was the reason i expanded my reading to other authors of contemporary romance, so i gave it a chance.I actually liked it better than i thought i would. Don't get me wrong, it's not her best work like Heaven, Texas or It Had to be You. But it was good.The characters were somewhat realistic and there were references to her looking like the first lady. I was able to understand why she wanted to leave the white house and i felt sorry for her. So all in all, it was a good read, kinda disappointing in the end,but good none the less. If your a susan elizabeth phillips fan than i would read it."
4,"One of SEP's best books since ""Kiss an Angel""","This book was entertaining and kept me interested frombeginning to end. I liked the way that the author worked inhistorical information about the performances of past presidents. She also touched on interesting dilemnas, such as an individual's right to privacy vs. the public's desire to know as much as possible about a beloved public figure like First Lady Cornelia. The constant name-dropping, though got tiresome after a while. Cornelia got make up tips from Sandra Bullock, and called former first ladies Reagan, Bush and Clinton for advice."
5,Another sleepless night,"Another sleepless night...I look forward to Susan Elizabeth Phillips' pub dates like I look forward to Christmas! This book kept me up all night laughing and crying. Having a sexy man, an interesting and mysterious heroine, a sullen teenager, and a toddler stuck in motor home together is hilarious. Ms. Phillips knows teenage girls and babies! And she knows about love. She continues to be my favorite author. Buy this for someone for Valentine's Day. I loved it."
1,I wish there was a No star,I had the hardest time finishing this book. I just couldn't get into the characters. It was not a fast read at all. I picked it up because I thought it would be a good story and while there was a plot to it it just didn't grab my attention.
3,Please,"After reading several of her other books, I was happy when this came out. I bought it right away. As I was reading it, I realized I didn't feel for these characters as much as the other ones I've read. I thougt Matt was mean and hateful. I felt so sorry for the girls, but not the two main characters. Matt also came off to me as being stupid. Who picks up strangers this day and age? I also think its hard to feel sorry for Cornelia. I just wished I hadn't bought this book, but rather on of her other one instead."
2,Erratic SF,"This story went a bit all over the map. Not as good as some of his later work. Not recommended. Instead read Blood Music or Eon, both wonderfully imaginative stories by this author."
2,Not his best,"Very difficult to get into. Throughout the book, but particularly in the first section (53 pages,) the author shows how divergent language has become between groups. The difficulty of trying to figure out what the characters are saying may help us understand how the main character feels, but did not allow me to immerse myself in the story.That alone might have set the tone for me and I never got into the story. Part of the problem was developing a whole new world, covering hundreds of years of new history and tying it together with new scientific advancements all in fewer than 300 pages. New characters and concepts are introduced and developed only in the most superficial way. Great ideas, poor development."
4,good quality,"good sturdy material(a bit lighter weight than i expected, but not bad), well made, and above all, it fits. broad shoulders and long arms can be a pain finding long sleeve shirts."
3,So-so Bleak,"So-so peek into very small time crime perpetuated by non-criminals. The ostensible hero, Chris, is mugged by the inept Leo, setting into motion a chain of events that will lead Chris, Leo, and Leo's buddy Kevin into a triangle of crime. All three are 25-35 and living dead-end lives in a London suburb. Chris' prospects are starting to look up very slightly (he lives in a YMCA) when he tries to juggle two new women. Predictable results ensue with the women, and the smalltime crime ends up in multiple tragedy. Trés bleak."
3,Drive In Trash,"The 70's had some great films and some that are fun to watch in retrospect. These fall into the latter category. Greydon Clark's repreatory cast give you some laughs in these two, you might enjoy them more if you are ""relaxed"" as you watch"
5,Soft Jeans,This was a gift for my step father for christmas and he requested soft jeans and this really fit the description.
3,BUYER BEWARE! This is NOT a Supersax album!!!,"This CD was recorded in 1982 & now appears for the 1st time on the ""LK JAZZ"" label which stands for Lee Katzman Jazz. Lee Katzman is a competent,lyrical trumpet player but not in the league w/, say, Art Farmer or Jack Sheldon.There are reasons recordings stay in the can for 23 years. Out of the 11 tracks Supersax ""accompanies"" Lee Katzman on only 4. Arranger,altoist Med Flory plays a bit on Bill Holman's ""BeBop Love Song"". That leaves 6 tracks by the Lee Katzman quartet which feature the real star of this recording, pianist Jimmy Rowles who plays in his sly & slightly off center style.And that's it. Don't even THINK Supersax...And don't even think of paying $20.00 for a musically mediocre experience.~David HeymannKKUP-FM"
3,sent to wrong address,package delivered to wrong address I had to call ups and track it down--the company can't tell the difference in two different zip codes
2,Price Too Good To Be TRUE,"Electrolux vacs are known to shut off automatically when bag is full. These bags repeatedly turn the vac off with a false reading of a full bag. When you check the bag it is not even half full and you have to put your finger in the hole and push debris down in to the bag to continue use. I have to do this at least 3 times per each bag usage. Next time I will pay the extra for the regular electrolux bags. Plus the bags tear very easily. I found this out when I tried to shake the dirt so it would settle, hence why I have to stick my finger inside the hole and push down the dirt."
5,Best bags for the Buck,"Great product at great price. Bags are same as Electrolux dealer will sell you, but at much lower price. Be sure to select this bag if you have an Electrolux Olympia model. There's another similar C-type bag listed on Amazon which won't be compatible."
5,33 a bag WOW !,Order arrived with all 48 bags nicely inter stacked as to not cause damage. These are the same bags I used to buy atWal-Mart for 50 a bag many years ago. The last time I bought these were almost $5 for a bag of 3. Now I will change the bag more frequently before they are jammed packed. This will prolong the life of my 40 year old Electrolux canister. And prolong the life of the money in my bank account. Me happy.
2,These are not genuine electrolux bags,"Should have looked closer at these before I bought. I had entered genuine electrolux bags when searching amazon and these came up. They say ""electrolux"" but they are NOT genuine electrolux bags."
4,Just like the real thing,"The bags fit my Electrolux vacuum perfectly and they work great. I thought maybe I would lose suction with a generic brand, but they work just as good as the name brand."
4,Good service,Rreceived product timely. Good service. Would order this again. Product is exactly as described. What else can ya say about vac bags?
3,only 12 bags,"I have twice purchased this exact ad for vacuum bags ""48 Electroux Type C Tank Model Vacuum Cleaner Bags 4 Ply"" The title indicates that you'll get 48 bags. The description indicates that you'll get 50 loose bags, and then both orders came with only 12 bags. Same mistake twice, even after I had explained the first time that I had only received 12 instead of 48. For this price, it's comparable to the bags that I can get at my Walmart and CVS stores locally ($6 for a 3 pack). If I had actually received 48 (or 50), then it would have been a great savings. Someone should change the title/description of these bags."
1,No filtering information,"I gave this product one star because it fails to state (on the web, bag or packaging) the size of the particles that pass through the bag. Electrolux states on their box that it filters out particles larger than 0.3 microns. It is not known how much dust these bags put back in the air, 4 ply does not answer this very important question. If it does not filter out much dust you are wasting your time with these bags."
3,So far OK - have used 3 bags (1 I ruined putting it on),The reviewers I read were right. The price is right on the bags so I bought them. THe product is not as good as the real deal but I figured I will still be ahead of the game. I don't think the bags hold quite as much as the electrolux brand. I hope they are doing the right thing with the 4 ply stuff like the real ones. I had one issue where I couldn't get the vacuum tube to penetrate the center hole. I read where one of the reviewers had an expensive repair due to that SO I was really good about double checking to make sure they were loaded properly. The small cardboard piece in the center ripped off and the bag was ruined. I am going to make sure that from now on the end of the cardboard is through the hold in the center and then they should load correctly each time (I hope). Bottom line is I think they will work just fine.
4,Program Planning and Evaluation for the Public Manager,"I consider this book to be very informative to program planning and evaluation. The authors included a complete and thorough explanation of system concepts, functions/techniques of planning, internal processes, outcome evaluation, cost benefit analysis and evaluation designs.I haven't read any other materials dealing with public planning and evaluation but this book clearly pinpointed specific issues to help guide an individual with no prior knowledge.The book wasn't difficult to read or understand. Chapters 1-7 were in sync from the beginning. Chapter 8 ends with a 10 point checklist for program evaluators. The book contained a wealth of information. However, there could have been more practice exercises and examples of program planning and evaluation. Also, the book could have been longer, it was very short but comprehensive."
5,It's not about men,What a great service this new author did for all women. The sections on Community and Sports really gave me some great ideas. They are my favorites.This is an engaging and informative book that covers many interesting aspects of being a single woman. Additionally the author gave the readers a summary of each chapter with a few gems at the end of each. Talk about respect for her reader's precious time.Great read. I am pleased to review it.
4,Very enjoyable and fascinating,"National Geographic does it again. A great story with excellent cinematography.Robert Ballard, actually found the site of the sunken aircraft carrier U.S.S. Yorktown. I think what I liked best was this documentary not only details Ballard's challenge in finding the Yorktown, which rests three miles below the surface, a mile deeper than the Titanic, but also provides an intelligent and gripping narrative of the Battle of Midway, in which four Japanese carriers were also sent to the bottom in a furious day of fighting that turned the tide of the war in the Pacific Four veterans, two Japanese and two Americans, who had been involved in the decisive 1942 battle also joined in the search. I also enjoyed the Special feature of WW2 cameramen. Fascinating!"
5,Excellent,We can appreciate this gigantic fight through film made by John Ford. Excellent bonus program : COMBAT CAMERAMAN. This track represents maybe the most emotional scene of this splendid DVD
2,Not So Fast,"I believe this documentary should have had two parts. One part dealing strictly with the battle itself, and the second part concerning the hunt for the lost aircraft carriers.The post-war search for the ships, in my opinion, gets ""in the way"" of the battle. Many facts are left out. One particular one is how the Japanese survivors of Midway were treated after they got back home. It probably was too difficult to mention those things with two Japanese sailors taking part in the search."
2,"A bit of a mess, really.","I found Simple Aggression's 1996 album Gravity in a clearance bin recently and decided to give the band a try. I figured that since it was on David Chastain's Leviathan label that it ought to be at least halfway decent and should have the kind of guitar shredding Chastain loves so much.More often than not, these cutout bin gambles pay off, but this time I struck out. Simple Aggression's sound seems to be a jumbled mix of thrash, grunge and nu-metal, none of which are my preferred musical genres. To make matters worse, it's bad thrash, bad grunge, and bad nu-metal. Gravity is also totally devoid of melody, which kills it for me right there.I'll give the band credit for maintaining a metal sound at a time when metal was a dirty word (hence the 2-star rating), but Gravity just isn't doing anything for me, and I'm pretty open-minded. It was a struggle to make it all the way through this album, and I'm not at all surprised that this was Simple Aggression's final album."
1,never received,Never received this product. Sent email to seller. Took second email and 1 1/2 weeks for a reply. Response was they would replace. I responded that I would prefer the tracking to see what happened to it. No response since. Will not purchase from them again
4,Good Board,"Biostar board are inexpensive and get the job done. This board has been running for two plus years and saved my wife's old computer. Her Soyo motherboard died after about a year of use and never performed properly from day one. Now, she surfs the net, plays Zuma, edits pics, and plays card games with no problems. I have used many Biostar board with many types of CPU's and they are probably the best bang for the buck on the market."
5,Good mother board,The motherboard is a great deal for an older board. Great for an internet computer.
1,Crap board,"got this board, installed it, DOA, had prescott processor,no beep codes,althought the fans came on ,nothing else happened,wont buy another BIOSTAR product, Will spend a little more for a better board.I hope this helps someone"
4,Balancing the views,"Like his other inquisition [[ASIN:080282126X What Did the Biblical Writers Know and When Did They Know It?: What Archaeology Can Tell Us About the Reality of Ancient Israel], the first half of Dever's book lists & examines all the available pertinent information - both archaeological and biblical. In the second half, he lists (and comments on) everyone else's conclusions. Only then does he arrive at what few real conclusions can be made.This is a pretty slow process - as if he were presenting a case in court. It does however result in a one-tome reference to all the salient details & opinions around this currently hot topic.There are lots of books out now regarding Asherah and the biblical God. Between his methodical approach, even-handed consideration of dogmatic and anti-dogmatic views, and overview of other people's books, I found Dever's book to be a more reasoned, informed & comprehensive guide than any other."
3,Lots of extraneous stuff,"As I read the book, I struggled with all the unnecessary material. The author spent a lot of time review other peoples studies into the topic and how he agreed and disagreed with their conclusions/biases. I found myself skimming large sections of the book.because it had little to do what the title of the book was, and was more a superficial review of other peoples books.I still learned a few things about this fascinating topic, but not as much as I had hoped."
4,Interesting perspective,"Interesting slant on the subject matter, but the insertion of numerious supportive texts in the narrative makes for a rather dry reading experience."
1,An anti-semite in Jewish clothing,Mr. Dever should be ashamed of his/this post-modern diatribe. Those who buy this drivel (in more ways than one) are not interested in Judaism but are instead intent on fostering their own warped worldview of how Judaism should be instead of how it actually is.
3,Not Thrilled,"I like Carrie, so don't get me wrong here, but.....not thrilled with this CD single......her rendition of the ""AI Song"" left me cold and I can think of 2 or 3 songs that she did on the show that would have been better than Independence Day, I truly hope they do a better job arranging her full length CD than they did with the single. She has talent RCA, find the songs that show it!!!!!!!"
4,"I actually, like it!","I was never a Carrie fan when she was on Idol but this isn't bad. The song, Inside your heaven, works alot better for her. She defently pulled it off.I give a 4 our of 5 cause independce day, Again? I mean, she sounds good on it but she sung it on idol twice, on showstoppers, and now her single. I don't know how much she had to do with it but I think a different song would have been a benefit."
4,"Amazing vocals, but dissapointed at song selection.","Carrie has amazing vocals and true sense of musicality. But having said that I don't understand why these American Idol producers (or management team?) can't seem to find better writing for these singles they release. You want to be inside my heaven? Please. And the Independence Day track is great, because it really features Carrie in her element, but it is the same track as on the ""Showstoppers"" CD. I really wish she would have recorded ""Crying"" becuase it was so beautiful on the show, but maybe that will be on her upcoming album. With all of that said, Carrie is an amazing vocalist and I'm excited to see what she does with her album!"
5,WONDERFUL!!,wow! carrie's voice is absolutly amazing and i cant wait for more of her CD's!! CARRIE U ARE SO AWESOME!!!
3,You need to hear the songwriter!,If you like Independence Day then you'll love Gretchen Peters who wrote it and has a great CD out called Halcyonand is releasing a new CD this spring.Learn why those in the UK just adore this gifted writer......she is quite the lyricist.
3,STOP VOTING with Amazon!,"Everybody STOP. The season is over. If you want to review either Carrie or Bo's single, then there is NO need to mention the other one. They are not competiting. You only make yourself look bad when you come and write a review on a CD you obvious do not own. (It would be sad if you bought a CD of someone that you mention you hate.) Seriously...move on. American Idol ended in May. No one is competing any more. This goes for all the 5 star positive reviews too. I find it hard to believe that 100% of Carrie and Bo fans TRULY feel their single is worthy of 5 stars. 5 stars is PERFECT. Again, stop voting! Voting ended weeks ago. And this is not the place for it. Your posts will be deleted eventually anyway. Move on to something mor erecent. Get SOME kind of life other than your bitterness over who lost, or gloating over who won."
2,What was that?,I listened to CD and was very disappointed! The singer screams to hit high notes - very squeaky and unpleasant voice. CD production is horrible. The girl sounds off pitch on her first song? Could not they fix it?
2,another mediocre female artist?,"true artists are born with a gift; they don't make mistakes. in the final show this girl was noticeably out of pitch at least once in every song. does anyone really think that this girl can out-write, out-perform, or even [nearly] equal the offerings of natural female talents such as shania twain or faith hill? of course not. so, what is the point?"
3,Carries first single.,When i heard carrie was releasing her first single i hadto go out and buy it.This is a pretty good single i haventgot her new album yet.i liked both of the songs ive already heardher sing both of these songs on american idol.
2,Another American Idol Miscalculation,"There is absolutely nothing special about Carrie's voice. Carrie won American Idol because she is young, blonde and pretty. Period. Clearly, she was far from the best vocal in this year's competition. Her voice is extremely average. I predict she MIGHT have one more hit and then fade into the same obscurity that Ruben is in, and Fantasia is headed towards."
3,Not Quite An Idol...YET,"Carrie Underwood...this year's American Idol winner. It is odd that so many people say that she was not deserving and yet she won by 15 million votes. Bo is the performer, but not since Kelly Clarkson has there been a small town girl with diva sized voice. What is LACKING in Underwood is what Clarkson possessed at such a high level: presence, not only on the stage, but in the recording studio. She will need work before she puts together a full effort, but this version of ""Inside Your Heaven"" was mixed with the right amount of country to remind her fans why they voted for her. I won't try to change your mind about who should or should not have won, but if you're a fan of the show--buy both singles. Bottom Line: Carrie is a country, less experience version of Kelly Clarkson. Give her time and she will blow your mind."
2,Keep the Volume Down on This One,"Carrie starts out sounding really pretty in ""Inside Your Heaven,"" but she soon transitions into her flaw of oversinging - it seems sharp and is really kind of unpleasant to listen to. ""Independence Day"" is pretty solid, but Carrie's cover of it simply is not as good as the original version of the song. Plus, I have heard her sing it so much (including on the AI Showstoppers cd) that the single isn't worth buying for that song."
2,She can't sing on-key,"While recording studios can do wonders for mediocre voices, Carrie has problems singing on key. I am amazed that so many believe she has a great or ""perfect"" voice. She has potential, but is certainly no Kelly Clarkson."
1,lackluster no talent,"I watched idol from the beggining and I could tell Carrie was not ready for a competition like this. Carrie has already grown into a great singer, but not as a performer. With the single, you obviously can't see her, but the quality is lackluster. I'd rather wait for a full album"
4,Carrie Underwood Future superstar,"American Idol winner Carrie Underwood first cd single ""Inside your heaven"" was handed to her and that being said, Carrie delivers. The cd version is slightly reworked and a chorus is added to the song as well as some echos and backing vocals. Carrie gives her all in the delivery and the final result is a great recording.The B side has independence day which Carrie delivers in the same fashion as the original Martina McBride versionOverall, This cd shows us why Carrie won American Idol and that she is here to stay. I just look foward to when she releases material that SHE wants and not what the idol producers force her to sing"
1,I aint fancyin this one,"i darnt thinik she did a vury good job. She should've tried to sing more from her heart then she couldve had a god turnout, she just sings but nothimg more, when is she gon realize that singing is more than just air ..dont get it"
1,Attack of the Robots,"I really think carrie has a pretty voice, but she doesnt have a heart, like the tinman, so she can't use that heart to put life into this cd.Sorry, just my opinion."
1,she is awful!! just awful!!,"Who on earth gave this girl a record contract? Her voice is so boring, she sounds like a robot. I'm glad I downloaded the single and didn't waste my 4 dollars on it.... EWW"
2,i don't fancy this one vury muche,she didnt sing too good is all ylly and screamy i just wouldnt by it oaver someone more talented lke faih hill and martia mbride...
3,The best is yet to come from this girl,"In my NSHO, Bo does a better job on this song. Carrie sounds a trifle strained, and Bo's voice is more relaxed. I have to wonder if they pushing Carrie to be too country and not letting her natural tone shine through. Not bad on Independence day, but this young lady has tons of potential."
3,I haven't heard the singles,"This is just a note of caution to all out there reading the reviews, if it seems like people are being malicious toward Carrie, or Bo, take thier review with a grain of salt. They may just be fanatics on either side trying to keep you from buying a CD you may like."
1,would be good if,"a. she got new managementb. she sang with more versatilityc. she sang with feelingsd. she sang with varietye. she was a different personsorry, Carrie just doesn't cut it."
1,she won't do well...,"to make this simple and clear, if you like CDs with above average music and top notch quality, do not buy this. it lacks in both areas and carrie needs better managers-- and fast"
1,American Idol goes down the drain,"i thought that american idol would come out with even more season talents but they seem to have gone dry, and espically with material also. this single is bad in so many ways i will not list, but i will only list to not buy this"
1,She's no Kelly Clarkson.,"Sure, Carrie Underwood has a strong voice. For the most part, she can hold a note and stay in tune. However, I find that she lacks a certain ability to connect with her audience. Upon listening to her single, I found myself admiring her voice without really thinking ""she's singing the hell out of this song."" There was no emotional response from me at all and to me, that's the hallmark of a truly great singer. Someone that inspires an emotional response. Maybe this is something that can be learned or that can be brought out in time but as of right now, Carrie Underwood just leaves me cold. If she wants to see who she could emulate, just look towards Kelly Clarkson, she never failed to connect with her audience. I hope Carrie has that kind of power in her and that we all get to see it."
2,Carrie has some amazing talent,"but for me, her talent did not really show in either song. I thought that Inside Your Heaven is poorly written, poorly arranged and overall a terrible song. No person can make that song great. Independence Day was done good, but the vocals still lacked."
2,Extremely Average & Overdone,"In my opinion, this CD isn't worth buying. I bought it because I liked the song ""Inside Your Heaven"", however I didn't like the version on the CD and Carrie sounded simply ok. It's not one you could listen to over and over again. Also, Independence Day is so overdone by Carrie, and done so much better by Martina, that there is no point in listening to it. Hopefully her full album is much better."
5,AMazing!!!!!!!,"The Single Is AMazing. I Was So Happy That She Debut At #1 on the Billbord Singles Chart!!!!!""Independence Day"" Should Have Been ""Angels Brought Me Here"" But Is All Good.. I Hope Bo's Single Debuts at #1. Good Luck To Both Of You!!!!!!!!!!=D"
5,Carrie is the BEST,This single is simply amazing. I can't wait until Carrie's CD comes out this fall!
1,"Disappointing, mundane, and short lived","I'd hoped that what I heard thru the Tv this season was wrong... That somehow Carrie wouldn't need heavy mixing and familiar songs to get anywhere near in tune. Sadly, this CD comes across with the same bland delivery as before... there's no life behind the music, only a mimic or whisper of talent that *could* be, but certainly hasn't developed yet. I sincerely hope that the producers of Carries future albums get her serious training and teach her that music is more than words and notes. I only gave it one star knowing her true fans would love anything."
1,huge Carrie fan dissapointed,"I really did like Carrie on the show. She was a sweet young girl, but once I bought this my view on her has changed. She didn't even try to sing well, this has to be a huge let down for me, and my relatives who liked her as well. We are all in accord, we feel she didn't try to sing with passion on Inside your heaven, and she yelped and screamed on Independence Day, and i feel she didn't really do very good of a job."
2,Blah,Not recommended. Very disapointing. Wished she had ALONE on the CD instead of Independence day.
4,An Angel Brought Her Here,"Carrie's new single is wonderful. Inside your heaven showcases her angelic voice, especially the glory notes. The only drawback to that song was the overproduction and choir backround. Carrie's voice is so beautiful, she doesn't need overblown music or backround voices. This is a problem with the producers, not Carrie, whose notes are perfect.Independence Day, however, was truly great. Probably better than her live performances, if that is possible.This cd is the beginning of a deservedly great career. She will be blessing us with her music long after all the other contestants (except probably Bo, who is good in his own right) have long since been forgotten. Carrie represents all that is good in humans and Perfect Idol material. Now if she would only hurry with her full length CD, and the second one, and the third one......."
1,Overrated...,"I liked Carrie on the show and all but I wasn't too impressed with the single. I wish she would have chosen a different song instead of ""Independance Day"" cuz we've heard that too many times. Nevertheless, Carrie's voice is great, hopefully her future albums will be better;)"
1,I'm not impressed,"I'm not a American Idol fan, but since I bought Kelly,Ruben's, and Fantasia's single I decided to try this one and I have to say I'm not impressed. This girl really isn't that good, she puts absoulutly no emotion into her songs. I think she will fade quickly so don't waste your money."
1,Not worth the 3 bucks,"When I heard Carrie's single was coming out today, I was pretty excited. But then when I heard it, I was disappointed. She shows no heart in her songs and especially with the song ""Inside You Heaven"" it's bad enough with the poorly written lyrics. ""Independence Day"" lacks any heart or personality. If you want a single with originality or heart, then you're looking in the wrong place if it's Carrie."
1,Carrie is a silly girl,"This single was awful, just awful (bo bo face) i mean she didn't even try hard she just screamed and yelled on the songs that she put on here. Maybe she didn't have any choice of what she wanted but no.. nnooo noo.. not good."
5,Don't pass this one up guys!,"I love Carrie Underwood. My daughter and I are huge fans of hers. She sounds brilliant on this CD. If you haven't gotten your copy of it yet, what are you waiting for?? You will love it. America fell in love with this sweet gal and so will you. Her voice is astonishing."
1,not up to par with other idol winners,"when i first bought this single, i thought it was good, but it wasn't. the american idol machine must have stopped with the enjoyable singles since this doesn't even come close to enjoyable Fantasia Barrino Kelly Clairkson and Rubens were mch better"
1,She's Overated (Nothing Special),I think this girl is very overated she's realy nothing special. I mean what's special about her she's a common cruise ship singer or someone you would find singing in a hotel lobby.
1,Her 15 minutes are almost up,Carrie is simply a lesser version of great counrty stars like Faith and Shania. I don't think this girl will be aroung for long. She comes off sounding very boring and generic on this single and it seems as though her 15 minutes are almost up. Sorry Carrie but you're already fading.
3,She needs work but not bad!,"Being a huge fan of the show, I thought Bo Bice deserved to win. He is original and possesses a better tuned voice! That being said, Carrie's voice is pleasant and pretty to listen to on INSIDE YOUR HEAVEN but she lacks as much spunk as Martina McBride has when singing INDEPENDENCE DAY....I hope she works on her range and her prescence so her cd will be a winner!"
2,Lacks Emotion!,"Carrie needs some help with her vocals. She needs a little zest in her voice. I think Bo did a much better version of this song and He keeps you excited and awake. Carries puts me to sleep.She will improve in time I'm sure, but she needs to work on putting some feeling behind her music.Good Luck Carrie!"
3,Lose the echo,This is an average song sung by an above average singer with below average production. They add way too much. Check out the awful echo effect they have added... Just let the girl sing! I am interested to hear her put out a full cd when they get time to do it right.
5,Closest you can to Perfection,"First off I hate country music, but Carrie Underwood is the only exception.Another reviewer said ""The next best voice of perfection"" and they were right. She has got the sweetest voice and we all know she really can sing naturally and without the help of computers.She sings two songs: ""Inside Your Heaven/Independence Day""""Inside Your Heaven"" is her single from American Idol.Im not sure exactly what the song means but it is beautiful.""Independence Day"" is the song she sang at her audtions and during the show.This is a touching song, it deals with domestic Violence or abuse, but you really have to listen to the words,for those of you who haven't gotten the chance to here the song it is not dark and deppresing, actually it's quite lovely.I strongly encourage everyone to buy her first album""Some Hearts"".You will get your moneys worth."
2,No heart,"When Martina McBride sung ""Independence Day"", she had heart in her voice, and she sang it with pride. She meant what she said, and it seems like Carrie Underwood just doesn't care, and doesn't really have heart in what she means...you can't feel her expressions.And in ""Inside Your Heaven"", Bo Bice was a little better for that song. Carrie does it okay, but still, barely any heart in her singing.In my opinion, Vonzell should have been in the top 2, Carrie didn't deserve it...it makes me feel that she got there from her body possibly."
2,She is lucky to have two songs on the CD,IYH is awful and Carrie sounds horrible on it. I can understand that people like Carrie from the show but I do not believe that someone can sincerely like Carrie's IYH. She screams like she cannot sing. She is lucky to have two songs on the CD.
2,Okay.... she isn't anything special,"Her voice just gets boring to listen to, i don't even play the second song, because its tired. This girl needs to learn she can't face up to Martina, what was she thinking embarrising herself yet again on the single. YUCK. Inside your heaven is a crappy original song, obviously was rushed, and the lyrics are ok. She sings it well for what it is.. credit for that. Overall, 2.3 stars... not very good Carrie; I expected more from the Idol that was to ""sell more than any other idol winner"" --Simon"
1,Not Worth It!,The songs are very passionless and leave much to be desired! Both sound very cold and mechanical and it makes the listener feel restless. I bought this CD today hoping it would be good but am greatly disappointed. Carrie does not have what it takes to rock the charts. I hope Bo's will be better.
5,FiVe Stars!!!,"Carrie is indeed worthy of the title ""american idol."" Great talent. Well done, CaRrIe !"
2,It's Not What To Expect From an American Idol Winner,"Very sad that this is the best that American Idol can put out as a ""first"" album. Looking forward to Bo's single. She's a cute girl with a pretty good voice but she needs to record an all Country album and maybe it will get better."
5,Everyone should buy this!,What a beautiful voice! This CD is awesome and everyone should run out and buy it!!!!!
1,Not the right song for her,Carrie has a beautiful voice but you feel nothing when she sings this song. It's like a karaoke version of an original. I don't know what it is about her but she cannot connect with lyrics and it really shows with this song.
2,Inside Your Heaven,Prefer male voice on this song......Bo Bice does it much better. Song is not good for either singer.............
5,FINALLY A GREAT AMERICAN IDOL SINCE KELLY CLARKSON!!,CARRIE IS SO GREAT PERIOD NOT ONLY AS A PERFORMER ON AMERICAN IDOL BUT AS A FANTASTICAL SINGER SHE PROVES BOTH THIS QUALITIES ON HER SINGLE! INSIDE YOUR HEAVEN IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN WHAT YOU HEARD ON THE SHOW THE MUSIC IS GREAT AND IT SHOWS OFF HER AMAZING VOICE. ALONG WITH INDEPENDENCE DAY WHICH IS AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL IF NOT BETTER THIS SONG IS A DEFINANTE SINGLE AROUND FOURTH OF JULY CANT WAIT UNTILL HER CD. CARRIE'S GREAT-FANTASTICAL!
2,"this girl is okay, but I would not reccommend the purchase","I must admit that Carrie did a decent job on Independence Day, but all of her yapping on Inside your heaven just destroyed it for me. That song is so sappy and unoriginal, she doesn't really connect with the lyrics. I wouldn't buy this, or any of her future albums."
1,"emotionless, very dissapointing outcome","if you are looking at carrie's single now for a good buy, then look elseware or at bo's or someone else's that won't make your ears bleed.. I suggest diana degarremos"
1,there is no spark in that voice of Carries,"With so many singles out, and after listening to Carrie's single, I hope Carrie has a great fanbase that will buy lots of singles for her. But, for us people who aren't fans, let's be honest, it's lackluster and you could see just a little more emotion or effort. So just let it blow over and pass on"
1,Not Good,Carrie comes off sounding very boring on this single!!!! Although her vocals seem good she completly seems disattached with the lyrics at times coming off as though she has no clue what she's singing about. If this is any sign of what her album will be like I'm not looking forward to it.
3,Lack of Originality.,"I was dissapointed with this single for one primary reason, It does not contain anything worthy sounding. She doesn't offer anything different in the field of country. She really just needs her own style, she will hopefully find it eventually.Inside Your Heaven - Beautiful voice, but lack of passion or response to lyricsIndependence Day - Sub par compared to the original by Martina.I will look into Carrie's album, but if I am dissapointed by that purchase as well, I won't be buying anymore of her releases."
5,BEAUTIFUL VOICE!!!,"All I have to say is that Carrie has a beautiful voice and I just love her CD. I can't wait for her next CD's!! I mean, this is American Idol material. This is FANTASTIC...BUY THIS CD!!! I can listen to any song that Carrie sings over and over again and just love it the same way I did the first time I listened to it. She is my IDOL and I think she's GREAT!!"
4,Beautiful voice.,"This young lady has a very beautiful voice, which will only get better with experience. Even though I do like Bo's version of ""Inside your Heaven"" better, Carrie does a wonderful job also. It's amazing how two different artists can make the song sound so different. On ""Independence Day"", Carrie definitely does the song justice, and I think Martina would approve. Good luck in all that you do, Carrie!"
3,"A little disappointed, but overall, pretty good","The only reason I'm rating this low is because I would have liked to see a different B side song. She sings ""Independence Day"" well, of course, as she did all season long, but it is the same song as on the compilation CD and I don't need two copies of the same song.""Inside Your Heaven"" was sung well, but as with all the other 'Idol' alumni's first singles, it's just not a wonderfully written song. She sings it well, however. I'm just looking forward more to her full-length album which, if her producers do Carrie justice at all, will have more than just sappy ballads.My mom is a bigger fan of Carrie than I am, and I ended up giving my copy of this single to her."
2,She is a nice girl but...,"I am sorry, but Carrie simply lacks any true emotion when singing. I watched a bit of Idol and she seemed something like a mannequin during her performances. This 'stiffness' reflects in her voice as well. I hope she finds success, and she appears to have a supportive fan base. I personally do not plan on buying any future efforts from her."
4,Nice everyday watch.Looks better than the picture.,"I use it for everyday wear. Its a little hard for me to see the time, but my eyesight is not what it used to be. I'm happy with the watch. I have several Bulovas, and will continue to add to my collection."
5,SWEET!!!,"It is great to have when you are stuck on a game. Comes loaded with codes and combined with the support you get, for the codes, it is worth the investment. Go to [..] for mor codes....."
2,over priced,honestly i bought mine for 20 to 30 dollors so if i were u i would not buy any thing from theses sellers cause thay are way over priced but i lost mine and now im looking for 1 so juststay away from the sellers that are trying to sell for more than 30
3,Not supported anymore,"I've been using the codebreaker on my PS2 for some years now and, though customer support in general was shoddy at best, the actual codes and website upkeep were delivered pretty diligently. However, Codebreaker's website seems to be broken as all old accounts have been deleted and it is virtually impossible to register anew, hence no new codes for anyone. The website administrators won't answer queries and there appears to be no resolution to this issue.Bottomline: the device works great in and of itself but those interested in getting new codes for games (or support of any sort) are left high and dry.CAVEAT EMPTOR"
4,Not bad,Great product and I would recommend it to anyone.The only drawback is that if you put codes in and save them to your memory card it does take some extra space.
5,Great product,This is a great product to buy when you want to do some cheating in your favorite games. The game list is HUGE and the cheats are very easy to use and put in.
4,codebreaker 9.3 for ps2,I've had no problems with any of my previous codebreakers and so far this one is no different.
3,"80GB PS3, nope!","After reading a review that this would work on the PS3, I ordered one up to give it a try. Sadly, although it may work on the 60GB model, I've discovered it does NOT work on the 80GB model. Before the disc even boots up, the PS3 returns to the main menu and tells you it is not compatible with this system. Oh well, here's yet another reason why I wish I'd bought the 60GB model...I'm giving it 3 stars, because I'm sure it works great, only I haven't seen it in action, and never will apparently on my 80GB PS3."
1,rip off,these people are putting expensive stuff for old Pelican Codebreaker Version 9.3 for Playstation 2 thats kind of wrong they should of lower it down more about around 50 or 40 dollars
1,pelican codebreaker version 9.3,the item was wraped up like ti were an brand new broduct once i opened it i notice the the disc had an huge scratch on it it doesnt work and i tried to return it but got no response
2,"no, please...","...or 2.4 stars, No survivors please: Bad points-way too hi priced, not enough action, no spaceships, aliens, laserblasts nor explosions but a lot of boring talk. Good points: good film quality, continuity & very few action scenes, namely-girl off bridge scene, seen on utube & crane trying to drop something on reporter, car over cliff & thats it. maybe i can like it better in a couple yrs to get into it.Better similar story watching: especially INVISIBLE INVADERS, john agar, & THE 27TH DAY.Black cobra-similar from my seeing it all thru but havent fully watched/gotten into it yet.Both shows are spoken in english, no subtitles.whatever most of yall; what else isnt new, [since this is a pretty good & mostly helpful review, where what ive input, (no one else adds but leave out instead, which is so important not to do)]."
4,game face paintball,"As the product title indicates, this gun is ideal for a game called ""game face paintball."" I found this game is fun to play with people who have broad faces, and more challenging with people who have narrow faces. As my face is narrow, I am a difficult target; but my friend Tim has a fat moon-shaped face, and is a slow runner. This makes him easy sport, albeit tiresome to continually hunt long after you've pock-marked his face and further augmented its lunar qualities. A combination of faces of varying widths and lengths easily mixes things up; try tossing in a few weasel-faced people, and you've got yourself an afternoon!Great product."
5,A good face gun,I find this face gun a good one. Finally somebody took the step and made a gun specially for the face. And it does the job. My former employer can verify this. I love this product.
4,"Very Cute, size runs short","I get lots of compliments on this top, the print is much BETTER than the photo, just heed the warning on sizing -- it is not tight, but it is short, and the bustline hits me around the collar bone. It doesn't stop me from wearing it, because the fullness and lightness of the fabric prevents it from looking too weird, just FYI, go for a larger size than you might otherwise."
4,Powerful biography of a larger-than-life literary figure,"Coe, a successful novelist in his own right, sets out on a seemingly quixotic quest: to craft a biography of the obscure and ultimately tragic life of writer BS Johnson. The biography itself is a work of art; Coe provides useful insight into Johnson's major works. Additionally, Coe has a sleuth's instinct, digging up all kinds of information on one of Britain's least understood avant garde writers."
2,I was a big fan of this coffee maker when I first got it but...,"I have owned this machine for over a year. Loved it when I first bought it. What I have found is it leaks like crazy on the counter (not just water), the auto stop for when you pull out the pot during brewing doesn't work. On top of that, it makes a marginal cup of coffee."
3,Solved the leak issue,"Like other reviewers, I experienced leaking coffee, i.e., not water. After looking at the drip process a couple of times, the leaking coffee could only come from one place--where it drips from the brew basket into the carafe. After some trial and error, I found that the maker will not leak if you place the carafe with the handle sticking straight out. Must be something to do with how the coffee pours into the carafe. If the carafe handle is moved right or left of center, the leak comes back. Good luck."
2,Great coffee for 6 months if you escape water hazard,"This beautiful coffee maker has a reputation for leaking water. We too had to return our first unit after leaking all over the counter creating electronic water hazards, and the help desk told us to switch the back resevoir rubber piece so the hole faces down (no more leaks). Mr. Coffee was very nice and sent us a new unit right away telling us to cut the cord on the damaged unit. Apparently the units are assembled with the hole facing up instead of down. We loved the coffee (using the Strong setting, paper filter and Mr. Coffee filter), but now 6 months later it suddenly broke. Water leaked, the electronic display steamed up and blacked out, coffee slowly dripped through then burned on the bottom. If you don't mind spending this much $$ for 6 months, get it. I'm giving up since it will cost much more to replace our counters. We've since been very happy with the Cuisinart DCC-1200 Brew Central 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker."
1,Buy a different coffee maker,"I purchased this coffee maker about 6 months ago, and have had nothing but problems with it. The water filter caused the water to only drip in one spot of the filter basket, so only part of the coffee grounds were used. This problem was fixed by removing the water filter. Everything else seemed okay for awhile... Then the pause to pour failed to work. ""Okay, I'll just wait until the pot is finished brewing."" Two days ago, it just went berserk by over filling the filter area while brewing and overflowing. That's it! I purchased a new coffee maker. This is the 2nd Mr. Coffee that I have purchased in the past year. I refuse to purchase this brand in the future."
1,leaks every time,"I purchased the FX-23 Mr. Coffee over a year ago, hoping I finally found a reliable coffee pot. It took a little longer than some of the other consumers, but it has been leaking for over a month now. A slow leak that leaves just enough water to cover the counter under the pot. Every other brand I've purchased over the years, malfunctioned eventually, but I thought I could count on Mr. Coffee...what a dissapointent. This morning it started making loud crackling sounds as it brewed, now I'm concerned about it being a fire hazard...I give up, I will be going back to a perculator."
1,Mine leaks also!!,"Add me to the unfortunate lot that got a bad model. The programmable feature is designed to make your mornings better but instead I get to wake up to a big mess on the counter! I've tried everything but it leaks 80% of the time, however it looks good......I wouldn't try to beat the odds if I were you."
1,This is junk! Don't buy one!,"Like all the other reviews on here say, this thing LEAKS. It has permanently stained my counter top. Whatever coffee is left in the pot quickly cools down. I'm throwing this away. I've never been so angry at an appliance!I'll never buy a Mr. Coffee product again!"
3,LEAKY RESERVE,"I received my coffee maker for Christmas and just thrilled with style, performance and features. Since then, followed all monthly cleaning instructions and changed water filters every month. During 4th months, noticed water under the reservior and it's getting progressively worse each time. We will try to return to retail store where purchased."
2,it broke after 8 mos.,"I loved the look of this coffemaker and when it worked made a great cup of coffee. However, after 2 months the lid to the decanter broke and fell off every time you went to pour a cup of coffee. I will say in Mr Coffee's favor that I called their 800 number and a replacement part was sent free of charge but now the entire unit won't perk a cup of coffee. The water just sits in there and nothing happens. The book says to clean the unit once a month which is kind of a hassle. I really thought I was getting a great coffeemaker but now I'm not so sure."
1,Awful tasting coffee - bad plastic,"I would rate this coffee maker higher for the styling and brew control features, but if it doesn't make a good cup of coffee it does not rate any stars. We ran just water thru for the first time, as the instructions state. Several pots of coffee were not drinkable. Terrible plastic taste. I am going to look for a coffee maker with a steel interior."
2,Not Worth It,"I've had this coffee pot for a few years and this morning it just died. Yesterday it brewed my coffee just fine and today- nothing. I tried unplugging it from the wall, refilling the water, and even giving it the old ""Fonz"" jukebox hit, but nothing worked. I probably won't buy this one again."
1,Frustrating to the MAX!,"If you happen to put the pot back in the machine about 5 degrees or more off center, it will spill coffee all over the burner and your counter top. Also, the time set buttons can be changed by incidental bumps. You dont have to hold a second button down to change the time so occasionally the coffee is old and cold when you wake up.Absolutely the most frustrating coffee maker I have ever owned and it will be replaced by the time you read this review. Dont do it!"
5,We love it,At first I was concerned about the narrow aperture for filling the reservoir but that has not been a problem. The unit is easy to operate and program. I did not need the instructions. I makes HOT coffee quickly. I like the timer feature that shows with a graphic timer how long the pot has been brewed. The Water filter seems a bit weak. I would guess it would filter out sand or seashells but honestly it couldn't be that effective.You can easily spend more that two times the price and get a worse unit from another manufacturer.
2,Don't buy this coffee maker,"Don't buy this coffee maker because the water leaks as you pour it into the machine and also after you have washed it and turn it over to to put it away. Also, if you make more than seven cups of coffee you end up with the grounds overflowing into the coffee. I purchased a replacement carafe and it leaked worse than the original. I'm now looking for a replacement coffeemaker."
1,Don't Do It!!,"I have owned a lot of coffee makers over the years and this is hands down the worst. It is slooooow, makes weak tasteless coffee and after about 6 months leaks. Junk."
1,Get ready to wipe the spills.,"This elaborate coffee maker has a very poor design despite its slick look and its sophisticated features. The coffee spills on the counter from time to time. You never know when you are going to wake up to a puddle of coffee on your counter and only half on your carafe. I had to put the machine inside a deep container to hold the spills until I replaced it with a different brand. I thought I had probably gotten a defective unit, but I see other people have had the same problem. I was very disspointed with this Mr. Coffee product."
1,BIG DISSAPOINTMENT,"I HAVE USED MR COFFEE FOREVER AND LOVE THE PRODUCT, THIS PRODUCT IS NICE LOOKING BUT TERRIBLE WORKING. I CAN'T GET A GOOD STRENGHT AND HAVE YSED A WHOLE 2 LBS OF COFFEE TRYING."
1,It ran for a week.,"I gave it 1 star because Amazon wouldn't accept ""-"".This coffeemaker ran for about a week, and was the shortestlived coffemaker I've owned. I'm in my 40's.Mine made coffee OK, maybe a bit chemical tasting. I didn't have any trouble with the timer. However, this morning when the coffeemaker turned on, it ran through a cycle and only made 2 out of 12 cups of coffee. It just gurgled without delivering any water to the shower head. I tried turning it off and back on, and it just finished the cycle. I had to put water from the microwave through the basket to get my coffee. I think some check valve got stuck.Also, I don't like the way the basket is placed over the water reservoir. If it ever overflowed, it would contaminate the reservoir with coffee and grounds, which would be very bad for the works of the coffeemaker, as the coffee would burn on the interior surfaces of the boiler and the grounds could clog things up.This is going back to the store today."
1,Hope you have a mop,"This machine leaks. It leaks from the time you put the water in to the machine until the moment you poor whatever coffee made it in to the carafe during the brew cycle in to your cup. Do not be fooled by its relatively cool styling. The clock is almost useless, there is a silly water filter that must be placed inside the filter basket and the carafe itself ensures that every cup of coffee you poor is an adventure. The coffee maker also has a 'strong' setting that allows you to turn your coffee in to undrinkable sludge."
1,Doesn't like up to Mr. Coffee's reputation,"In the past year I have had two of these coffeemakers and my mother has had two. None have lasted more than 6 months!N In fact, my mother's last one worked for less than one month! It is a guessing game to see how many cups you have in the morning. Mr. Coffee has replaced, no questions asked. But it is not worth the trouble."
1,It leaks!,Our first pot leaked all over the counter! And it hasn't stopped since! Don't get this coffee maker!! You'll regret it!!
2,Mr. Coffee is a player.,"I got up early today since it is the start of the marment hunting season. I turned on the kitchen light to find Mr. Coffee having his way with Mrs. Butterworth. Dude aint picky. I probably wouldn't have minded if he was rocking the Swiss Miss, but seeing Mrs. B. bent over the toaster kinda left me queesy."
1,Moisture problem,"Moisture build up from leaks and steam caused the internal clock to stop working. When the clock doesn't work, the coffee maker doesn't work. It was great for the first 3 months."
2,"Good Coffee, but the machine leaks onto the burner","We've had this coffee maker for about 6 months, and for the past 3 months, it has consistently leaked coffee (not water) onto the burner and countertop. I do enjoy the coffee that actually makes it into the carafe, but there is too much spillage and mess to make this machine a keeper. I'm opting for the Cuisinart 12 cup Brew Central machine, based on the reviews here. Don't bother with this one."
1,"LEAKS, leaks, leaks!","I'm an Engineer, and at one time I thought I had the leaking problem figured out. But after six months of owning this machine, the leaking continues. My wife now keeps a wash cloth under the machine anytime she brews coffee.Stay away from this product!"
1,LEAKS!!,"I have been through 3 of these. Im not buying them anymore, after about few months of good coffee, it starts to leak, it has turned my lovly tile counter brown in the grout, we had to start brewing coffee with a wash cloth or towel underneath it. Then after dealing with the leaks, it just completly stops working all together! This has happened with all 3 of mine!!"
3,After 1 year.....,"Coffee still taste good, unit leaks onto counter, can not find from where. It's starting to corrode in different spots on the ""metal"". Have always had a tough time not getting water down the back of the unit when filling.Loved it for a whole year had hoped for more time, but can not stand seeing the spots of corrosion anymore, my eye is drawn to them, and in my newly redone kitchen, It's not acceptable. F.Y.I It was 1 year old in June, afterwards in November is when the corrosion became obvious."
1,BEWARE--ABSOLUTE GARBAGE,"We've been struggling with this machine for the year we've had it. This morning I hit the breaking point, smelling the acrid burning aroma of coffee leaking all over the place, pouring into the sink, onto the floor. I've ordered another, more expensive brand of machine. Don't let the trendy brushed metal surface fool you--Mr. Coffee products are absolutely worthless. You're better off buying powdered coffee or taking a vivarin, or buying from a company that has some quality."
1,Counter coffee,I agree with other reviews. Coffee is all over the counter and it appears that the basket is the problem. It's going back to the store.
1,Quit already,I have had this pot for maybe 5 months. When you start brewing a pot it beeps like it is done barely after it got started and then quits. Do not buy this pot.
1,I would give this coffee pot a NEGATIVE SCORE IF I COULD,"We recieved this coffee pot as a Gift in December. Six months later, the tank (not the decantor!) I can't make coffee if the coffee pot leaks. Yes, the company has been cooperative; however, they made and sold a BOGUS coffee pot. (It is 5:30 in the morning, and I am MIFFED that that I can't make a cup of coffee.)"
1,Run away fast....,"I wrote off our problems with the first one as bad luck. It's a cool looking coffee maker and the coffee isn't too bad. However, it kept thinking it was out of water and would stop brewing after 2 cups had been brewed with 10 cups left in the reservoir. As luck would have it, the replacement maker (the exact same one) worked for about 2 weeks before the same thing happened again. Not sure if Mr. Coffee has a Quality Assurance department, but they might start by reading these reviews."
1,"leaks, leaks, leaks,","In the long term, a year or less expect this coffee maker to leak....everywhere. The dial indicator will fog up and will not be able to read it. We have the red one. Looks great on the counter, but the metal will begin to rust...yes rust..and corrode around the bottom (where it meets the plastic. So off to find another one....any suggestions?Mr. Coffee blew it this time.Beautiful on the outside, but worthless on the inside."
1,Built to leak,"Just bought this a couple of weeks ago and noticed that water is on the counter every time coffee is brewed.When brewing, water leaks out of the back of the machine (about 2/3 of the way up the back is a hole that allows steam to exit - the problem is, it's not steam exiting, it's water dripping). Anyway, the water leaks down the back, over the cord, and onto the counter.Fire hazard anyone?"
1,Fire Hazard,I bought this coffe maker a few months ago. Tonight I was washing dishes and noticed that it was hot but the lights that indicate that the machine is on were off. Somehow it turned itself on and would not turn itself off. If I was not at home it might have caused a fire.Tomorrow I will be contacting Mr. Coffee and whatever government agency is in charge of product recalls.
1,Mr Coffee does not last,"I bought this coffee maker in Januaary of 2005. It worked great right out of the box but by June it was leaking water all over the counter. I sent it back and they replaced it with a new machine at no cost to me. I figured ok that was just a bad one in the bunch. The second machine now has steamed up the clock which is no longer usable therfore making the programmable feture useless. I bought the machime for its design, progamability and color but I found after two machines it was not worth it. better to spend more money and get something that lasts more than 6 months."
1,"Some nice features, but...","Pros: Looks nice, delay brew feature, self-cleaning, temperature setting for plate warmer (definitely nice if you take lots of cream).Cons: My gourmet coffee tasted horrible in this machine! I tried it on regular strength and strong, and both were weak and nasty (and I read and followed the directions precisely!). I returned this machine after five days. For the price and Mr. Coffee reputation, I expect much more."
5,Best Tasting Coffee ever!!!,"We purchased this coffee maker last night, programed it to automatically turn on at 7:00am, and had our first cups. Ours came with the water filtration system. we used it, along with the water from our brita pitcher. I tell you, it was the best coffee I have EVER had! It taste so smooth, and all we used was folgers regular brew. I recomend purchasing this product with the water filtration system. It makes a huge difference"
1,STAY AWAY,If your home is of value to you do not buy this coffee maker Here's my story- bought the first time I saw it out in 2004. Used it a few months and used the clean cycle. It over heated so bad that it almost ruined my cabinets. I was so angry I called Mr. Coffee number. They were WONDERFUL said no problem I will send you a new one and they did. Great. Put that one away they did not ask for it back.Coffee Pot number two. Better decanter design gave me the stainless steel upgrade. Green clock fills up with moisture and the top on brew design this time over heats and afraid this one will burn the house down. Now this isn't one time buy mistake but bought and replaced. Always leaked all over and very disappointed with it. If you value your home and prefer not to burn it to the ground don't buy this coffee pot. Bought a cuisinart 14 cup-per. Stainless Steel. Love it.
1,Brewer Leaks.,"It brews good coffee, looks great. Problem is it leaks (a lot) onto the burner and below the unit. We have sent it back and had 2 replacements. All three started leaking within a few weeks. I am now looking for another make or model of coffee maker as it appears they have not been able to resolve the leakage problem with this machine."
2,Bad Clock Mechanism,"BE ADVISED THAT THE CLOCK IS PRONE TO MECHANICAL FAILURE!!! I have returned a ""sister"" version of this coffee pot THREE times. The first time was just a broken carafe, but the 2nd and 3rd times were mechanical failures. After the 1st return, I repurchased the same pot. Within one month, the entire clock faded to black and would not work, which meant NO timer functioning. I thought that this was a fluke, so I returned the pot (again!) and got another one. After 3 months, the clock still worked, but the option to set the clock or turn on the timer just STOPPED working. Out of the blue! So, it too was returned. I don't think I'll be buying any Mr. Coffee products again. BE ADVISED THAT THE CLOCK IS PRONE TO MECHANICAL FAILURE!!!*By the way, I have had the same problems as everyone else (overflowing at filter, dripping onto the burner, etc.), but I could deal with them as long as my morning coffee was actually made in the morning."
2,looks nice but leaks...,coffeemaker leaks...bought it for its looks(red) but it leaked and started to blister on body...trashed it. my friend bought me another one (identical red)... leaking again.... it has turned my beige grout lines brown now.
2,Not all it is cracked up to be,"We purchased this maker at Cosco around 5 months ago. Liked the machine, coffee was hot and tasted good. My wife was telling me she was finding water under the pot after a few months, not always but now and then. All the sudden a week ago wanted to make coffee and nothing happened. No power to the pot. Called Mr. Coffee and gave them required info and they sent a new one at no charge. My complaint is in the last few years we have gone through 4 Mr. Coffee pots. They may have been good at one time, but these China made pots are a waste of money. Anyone know of a good coffee pot that is actually made in USA or Europe. I am done with Chinese garbage. Will use a cheap percolator if need be."
1,Fire Hazard!!,"I purchased the 12-cup Mr. Coffeemaker even after reading all the reviews here. I solved the overflow problem out the back and could even live with a few drips of water on the counter due to the condensation on the interior of the lid. Loved the brew strength feature and the design of the carafe. However, what I simply WILL NOT live with is a fire hazard. Twice now, I've shut the machine off and either the warming plate didn't disengage itself or it came back on. I'm also old enough to remember that Mr. Coffee was the appliance that caused many a housefire and was under a huge recall in the mid 70s for just that reason.Item will be returned and a different brand purchased!"
1,Annoying coffeemaker!,"I bought this coffeemaker @ Costco. It's a brand name and was a good price. However, it turned out to be an annoying alarm clock! After bubbling and hissing as it brewed coffee, the maker beeps to let you know it's done! My husband gets up at dark-thirty to commute to his job. He already has an alarm clock so doesn't need a beeping coffeepot to wake him (and me who does not need to get up so early). About 2 hours later, the machine beeps again to let you know it's turning off.I took it back, bought a different model w/o beeping and it too has mechanical difficulties. But that's another story.I think my husband should switch to drinking Mountain Dew. It's not as noisy.""Sleepless near Seattle"""
1,Its a pice of Cr**,"I have to give it one star because Amazon does not have an option for 0 or negitive ten ( -10 ).It leaks, it has fiddly parts, the filter shut off plunger is activated by a plastic bobin that falls out of it's plastic holder, becuase the parts are the WRONG SIZE!!! It just keeps comming loose. Even if it worked, the device is designed so that a pool of coffee sits in this plastic part, waiting to start driping a teaspoonfull of coffee when ever you remove the container.Not only that but the only way to pore the coffee is by removing the contaner top, or pressing the buttion on the container handle, and that broke two.This looks good but, is junk. We have not one, but TWO defective parts that have broken, or or come loose. Even if they all worked, it would still drip because of the way it's made.JUNK! JUNK! JUNK!"
1,Worst Coffee Maker Ever Owned!!!,"This is by far the worst coffee maker I have ever owned...and also wins the prize for being the pot that was replaced the quickest. I think we owned it for about 3 months. Whoever designed this thing was an idiot. The basket doesn't always sit correctly and results in coffee pouring out everywhere but in the pot. Coffee ends up all over the counter...and this resulted in the burner plate rusting out and losing it's protective coating. The coffee was NEVER hot, no matter how high you turned up the burner control.It is a nice looking coffee pot...so it you want to just use it for decorative purposes...this is for you!"
1,Another leaker!,"Boy am I glad I checked here before replacing ours with a duplicate. I thought maybe we just got a bad one! Apparently this leaking problem is a product design, not just a one-off issue. Thanks to all you Amazon reviewers!"
1,Weakest Coffee Ever,"While we haven't encountered the leaking issue (yet), no matter what we do the coffee comes out weak (tasting of brown water). We've tried a number of things (adding more coffee, switiching from a medium to a full roast, grinding our beans differently, using pre-ground beans, etc., the list goes on) to no avail. And yes, we read the manual and have all the parts in place. Despite the attractive looks and moderate price, this model is a huge disappointment and a waste of time, good coffee beans, and cash. DO NOT BUY THIS. IF YOU DO, KEEP THE RECEIPT AND BOX. 0 of 5 stars."
1,STAY AWAY - TURNS KITCHEN INTO COFFEE SWAMP,"Awesome coffee maker that fails at one simple thing...MAKING COFFEE!!!How can you mess up a simple invention so poorly? Every time we make the coffee, the coffee goes on the floor...pours on to the floor.Could be a great gift for someone you really dont like!"
4,Yummy cup of coffee,Maybe not the most convenient system but I don't mind going to a little extra effort for a good cup of coffee. I find with the strength setting we use less coffee and get a much richer flavor. We got this model at Costco for $30 with the idea that it would hold us over until we could afford a Bunn. This is only our second pot but I am in no hurry to replace it.
5,Mr. Coffee 12 cup Programmable Coffemaker,"This is a terrific product. No Problems, looks great, makes coffee how everyone likes it and looks great on the counter. We have 4 coffee drinkers in the house, everyone is more than satisfied."
5,second one,This is the only coffee maker that I have had in 20 years that makes a real hot cup of coffee. When the first one broke- I ordered another right away.
4,Hate the beeping!,"This is a pretty good coffee maker. I haven't had leaking problems, yet! I've been using it for about 6 months. My complaint is that when the the coffee is just about done brewing, the maker beeps. Some people may like this, but I don't. And you can't turn the beeping off. I've called Mr. Coffee and it's not an option. I do like the way you set the clock and timer. Very easy."
2,Never again...,"I have had mine for a little over 4 months. Today I am heading out to buy a new, hopefully better, automatic coffee maker somewhere. I have been cleaning up coffee from it leaking underneath since day one. Also it drips down on the plate, while the coffe is making and not only smells but makes a hissing noise. Two days ago it starting stopping before the pot was made, beeps going off although water was still in the tank. The top gets so hot it feels like it will melt. Today it takes me over 20 minutes to get two to three cups out of it. I have had it with a Mr Coffee Makers. This is my second one. The other version wasn't much better."
1,Zero Stars for this poorly designed piece of c___,"Leaks, leaks ,leaks everywhere. Filter hard to access and hard to seat. I paid a lot of money for the worst coffee maker ever designed. My husband made the comment that someone designed it who had never gone to an engineering class.How would you like to have hot coffee rolling off your counter top onto the floor every morning? If this sounds like you, go ahead and buy it."
2,Don't bother buying,"This product leaks. Looks nice, has nice features but leaks coffee all over counter."
2,Buy this if you are into Coffee Sports,"This coffee maker is beautiful! It looks great! I bought it to replace a vile Black and Decker that refused to turn on again after I forgot the pot one hungover morning. This Mr. Coffee had its control panel on top so I felt secure buying it. Wrong! Unless you put the filter and the pot in the exactly precise way in the exactly precise order, the flipping coffee maker spews coffee all over the place except in the pot or worse, backs up into the fresh water container. I ordered a Braun off Amazon so this is going in my storage closet in the basement. I'll review that item after I used it for a while. I have to admit the coffee tasted great, but I couldn't trust it, I couldn't leave it unattended. I was nervous when I heard it go on in the morning for fear I had set it up incorrectly. It just wasn't worth it. Its the closet for Mr. Coffee cause I'm just not into coffee sports on my kitchen counter. Skip this filthy machine!"
1,Bad Design !,"I always liked the brand of coffee makers , but come on ...nobody can come up with a design for the water reservoir , so it doesn't spill water everywhere when filling it ? What a pain in the behind !I can't fill that stupid thing up without having most of the water hitting these stupid little plastic bars and running down the sides and the back of the coffeemaker !Time to check out other brands I guess ...it's too bad , they do look nice , but that's it !"
2,it was fine until it just stopped,it was great until it just stopped working. i put the coffee in like usual.. poured the water in and waited... like a sad little puppy i waited and waited for the 2 ingredients to combine and the most amazing aroma of fresh coffee to fill the house. it didnt happen. it just gave up on me.
2,Leaked then broke.,"I actually quite liked this coffee maker while long it still worked. It looks nice and is quite well designed, especially given its price. Unfortunately, this coffee maker stopped working within 10 months of purchase. The end."
3,"The coffee's alright,but the Coffeemaker has alot of problems","The coffee's alright,but it does leak water all over your floor if you don't place the inside plastic container just right.This has happened 2 times in a month,and it does take along time to make a full pot.If this one goes bad,I'm not buying another one."
2,"Looks good, but.....","This coffee maker is NOT durable at all. I owned mine two years (which seems to be longer than most others) and it now leaks all over the place when I am brewing coffee. The coffee leaks from the filter basket down the side of the carafe down to the burner and all over the countertop. I'm done cleaning up after it. I bought the red Hamilton Beach coffee maker to replace it. It's a shame, really, because this is one of the best-looking coffee makers out there."
2,Not Durable - Leaking Carafe,Worked fine for a year - now carafe leaks all over the counter when you pour from it. Coffee quality is a little better than average but now I buy a carafe or replace with a better built unit. Last Mr. Coffee I will own. ....Where have you gone Joe DiMaggio??????????
3,Best looking coffeemaker ever...BUT!,"First of all this thing looked great on my kitchen counter. I also love the beeps that let you know when the warmer plate is shutting off, so I can go restart it if I wish. Most people that saw it loved the look. But the thing started to leak. I was having to wipe up everytime I made coffee. I had to replace it after about a year. Mr Coffee, if you`re listening, fix the leak problem and I will definatly buy another one."
1,Leaks Like a Sieve,"I don't know for sure how to spell ""sieve"". But I know one thing. This coffee maker leaks big time. I guess I'll buy a new one but it won't be Mr. Coffee. 2 of the screws on the bottom were stripped so I couldn't take it apart but I don't know how to fix it anyway. How did these screws get stripped?"
1,Don't buy it!,"Don't buy it! It looks nice on the outside and had all the features I wanted but it's awful. I say that because I can't set it on timer or ever leave it unattended when I start it because 9 times out of 10, no matter how gently or perfectly you set the carafe in, 3/4 of the coffee goes into the carafe and the rest is all over the counter! This is not operator error...trust me. This is why I'm on Amazon right now searching out a new coffeemaker."
1,stay away from this coffee maker,It is like cleaning up after a puppy. It has a small leak that will not go away and luckily I was just watching as the face blacked over and apparently was about to errupt in flames. Coffee shouldn't be this much trouble. Stay away!!!
3,Works when propped up! :),"I finally figured out how to make this thing work...prop up the back of it about an inch or so and wha-la, no more niagra falls of coffee in the kitchen.If you still prefer to use this as a gag-gift, it's perfect seeing that 12 cups of steaming hot coffee on the floor is always hilarious!"
5,GREAT machine!,"I cannot for the life of me figure out what other reviews must be doing wrong to be having ""spilling on the counter"" issues. I have been using this coffee maker for about 6 months and just love it! The programmable feature works great. We make 2-3 pots of coffee every day and have NEVER had coffee leak during the brewing process. The adjustable brew strength feature works great and to top it all off, this coffee maker looks GREAT in my kitchen.When I first bought this coffee maker I had problems with the decanter spilling when I poured from it. I emailed Mr. Coffee and they shipped me a redesigned decanter for free. Since then I couldn't be happier.I've always loved Mr. Coffee products and this one is no exception. Buy it...you'll love it."
1,What a mess!!!!,"I loved the looks of this machine and all the features, but the programmable feature is useless because there was always coffee spilling all over the counter. You had to stand right there while it was brewing and clean up the mess. Don't waste your money on this machine!!!"
1,piece of trash,this is the WORST machine that i have ever purchased and i am an avid coffee drinker so i know whereof i speak. we went through two machines and the problems were the same: 1) the machine LEAKS; 2)unless you put the spout at an exact angle facing the back it won't make coffee (they never bother to tell you this) and 3) the coffee tastes like it has been chemically processed - even if you buy a high quality coffee bean.do not be suckered by the attractive appearance and high-tech gadgets.
1,Kicked the bucket after 5 months of moderate use,"I loved the look of this coffeemaker and thought it would go great with my shiny, modern appliances in my new-to-me home. This thing died after 5 months of moderate use. The crazy thing is, I didn't even brew coffee in it, Everyone in my family likes something different so I just heat water up twice a day for coffee, tea, and hot chocolate. So, no grounds to gunk up the works and it still died. I didn't notice any buildup in the carafe.There could have been tons in the machine itself but, with the crazy way it was designed, I couldn't get in it to see. I couldn't even take it apart to try to fix it. All in all---pretty to look at, pretty disappointing to own."
3,"Problematic coffee maker, great company to deal with","I had to mention that we had the same problems noted by many reviewers with the leaking. I contacted the company and they immediately sent me a new filter basket, after which we never had a leaking problem again.Then just last week the coffeemaker stopped brewing altogether. Again, I contacted the company, looking for troubleshooting suggestions, maybe to see if it could be repaired, but instead, they immediately sent me a new coffee maker! No questions asked, no charge...I was amazed. And it was not under warranty anymore (we bought it over a year and a half ago).So I would say that even if you have trouble with the coffee maker, the company is great to work with, and will fix the problem for you if you just ask."
4,Glad I didn't listen to bad reviews.,"I bought this coffee maker a little over 2 weeks ago aand I love it.Pros:It is attractive, it is more compact and narrower than many programable machines, it makes great coffee, adjustable heat hot plate, Adjustable brew strength.Cons: It beeps loudly 5 times when coffee is finished brewing. Not everyone in my household gets up at the same time in the morning- at least we didn't until the machine started waking us. No way to adjust or turn the beeping off.I haven't had any of the problems mentioned by other reviewers (knock on wood). Glad I bought it!"
1,The worse coffee pot ever,"I've had this coffee pot for almost two years now, and once in awhile a hose decides to pop off and then all the water just run's out. And like every review I read I have coffee all the time under my coffee pot all the time don't know where it's coming from but it's driving me crazy. I paid over 60 dollars for this coffee pot thinking it would be worth the money big joke it is the worse coffee pot I think ever made. Spend the extra money and buy the bunn it's worth every penny. Don't waste your time with this coffee pot. It should have a recall by now. And I'm so sick of putting to much water in it and having the water run all over the cord isn't that going to case a fire. If you just go a little past the 12 mark will have water pouring out of the back of this. This coffee pot shouldn't get any stars."
1,Worst Ever!!,"Would give 0 if possible. Mine must have been had the extra feature of spilling hot water out the back as well as coffee grounds overflowing into the basket, and the pause lever that is absolute garbage dripped coffee constantly if I tried to grab a cup while brewing. This is absolute garbage and so is this company. They have no desire to help fix your problem and do anything possible to prevent you from following up on your claims so they can save some money. The design is definitely attractive looking but that will no way justify the price. AWFUL!!"
1,"Beautiful looks, bad mechanical design","I returned this coffee maker for a full refund today after owning it for just three weeks. I was taken in by the beautiful design, but what use is looks if it doesn't work as it should? And this certainly doesn't. After a week, coffee started leaking all over the countertop during every brewing cycle. Then, it suddenly beeped ""finished"" after brewing just a cup or two, and had to be manually reset. There's also a small hole in the back which spouts steaming hot water for some unknown reason.Fazit: Don't buy this. It is full of design flaws that they need to take care of."
4,No Problems,"This is the first coffee pot I have used that I have not had a problem with. We have been using ours for 6 months and never had it leak. I wonder if some of the problems are usere related, I only say this because at my job I have 6 different coffee makers that are used and some tend to leak when certain users are making coffee. I suggest maybe using a reusable basket, instead of disposable filters, that is what I use. I definately recommend this pot to anyone.I only rate it 4 stars because the replacement water filter disks are expensive and hard to find, however it can be used without them."
1,Worst Coffee Maker ever! Complete waste of money!,"I saw this in the stores and thought (as many people did) that it was an attractive looking coffee brewer. I also thought Mr. Coffee was a trusted brand. Wow, I was way wrong on that. This thing is nice to look at, but really no better than a clock that looks like a coffee maker. Do not waste your money on this thing like I did. I feel like such a sucker. The coffee that does make it into the container tastes like cra*. But for the most part all the coffee it tries to brew winds up all over my counter top. Mr. Coffee manufacturers should be ashamed of themselves for this rip-off/practical joke on people. I only hope that at least somebody got fired for making this piece of junk. I give this product 0 stars, at least I would if I could. If you bought this recently, save your receipt and take it back ASAP."
1,DON'T BUY THIS COFFEE MAKER,"Without going through all the details...this coffee maker is the worst I have ever seen. I thought paying a little more for it would mean a better coffee maker? Hmmm....should have known better. I swore off Mr Coffee years ago and should have continued to do so. If I could have rated it a ""0"" I would have.If you like lots of coffee on your counter and constantly pressing the filter basket down when you set up a new pot go ahead and buy it. If you would rather walk away and know your coffee is brewing in the pot and not the counter...buy another brand. Trust these reviews...the majority are against the coffee maker. Good luck!"
1,Leaks,This coffeemaker should be recalled. It often leaks coffee. Mine is two months old and I'm going to heave it. No more Mr. Coffee's for me.
1,A true waste of money for a waste of space.,"I bought this machine for the reputation that Mr. Coffee has, but this thing called a coffee machine is anything but freindly.I set it for coffee the next morning and, I came out to coffee all over the counter and floor. Well even if you are standing there, it will pour all your counter. I studied what was going on, thinking it must be me and found, that the basket is the problem. Something that should have been fixed. I am now going to buy another coffee machine, but it won't be Mr. Coffee."
3,"Does the job, but not for the coffee snob.","- Leakage problems do occur as other reviewers have pointed out, for me about every 6 brews or so. It can happen if you don't seat the carafe precisely. It's a mess; coffee spills onto the burner and leaks from the bottom of the machine. Not pretty.- Only 900W. Coffee isn't hot enough right when brewed (I pour cup then microwave it for 30 seconds). I've heard tell that in order to extract the oils and flavors from the coffee bean, you need at least 1000W of power. This comes just shy.- With the carafe design (slick-looking, but impractical), you have to completely invert it (upside down) to shake out the last few ounces when pouring, also when you are cleaning it, water will stay trapped under the lip unless you shake it upside down.- I am a coffee snob of late, so I plan to plunk down the cash for a high powered machine with a thermal carafe (deciding between the economical ""Zojirushi EC-BD15BA"" or the pricey ""Capresso MT-500"")."
3,It Leaks Brown Water!,"Well, I bought this at the mall type place without much selection. But I have to say that it does leak in areas that you are not looking at (I have no clue where it leaks). I have to also blame the ground beans everywhere on the counter on this machine. I am sorry to say I am switching to something else once I save up some dough."
2,Loud,It makes coffee ok. At the end there is a very loud beeping that will wake up others that are still sleeping. I can get around it by momentarily unplugging it at the end of the cycle. I'll probably take it apart to stick a fork in the beeper at some point.
1,Poor Quality Machine,"I bought this coffee maker because it seemed that would do all that I required of a coffee maker. Unfortunately, this machine is one of the worse coffee makers I have ever used. It leaks coffee when caraff is removed to pour a cup. It will brew a whole pot of coffee only 4 out of 7 tries. The other times it will just stop halfway through. Very frustrating early in the morning. To top it off the caraff requires pouring over the sink since it is trerribly easy to spill. If my french press had not broke, I would toss this."
5,Great coffe pot!,"I saw this coffee pot at my father in law's.I really liked it so I ordered it.We love it!It is very easy to use and easy to clean.I love the filter, it is a great added feature."
1,Don't waste your money,"I've had this coffee maker less than a month & it's falling apart.The top of the coffee maker came apart it's now in 3 pieces. I have to reassemble the lid every time I make coffee. Also, the water filter design is lousy you have to take it out & put it back in every time you add grounds."
2,Bad Coffee Maker,"I alway liked this manufacturer and when our high end maker went, I opted for this model. It lasted less than four weeks in my house.I never could get a good pot of coffee from it. The ""warming base"" never really kept the coffee hot, for a decent period. And, the small writing on the faces and gauges, really could not be easily seen, causing further confusion and aggravation.Mr. Coffee should stick to the four cup makers and less varities."
1,Incompatible with Windows XP SP2,"I don't know what the problem is or who is responsible, but the 1TB version of this drive is a nightmare due to constant ""delayed write failed"" errors. I suggest you do some research before buying this drive, as I suspect it's identical to the 1TB version except for using 400MB drives instead of 250MB drives."
2,Do yourself a favor and stay away from Best Price,"This is the first time that have felt compelled to write a review here. (actually the second, Best Price asked me to remove my first bad review after they promised me a return of my shipping and handling) First the part arrived a week later then latest expected date. I received no response from email I sent asking where my part was. I did finally get a phone call after I posted a bad review here. As I said earlier I was told that I would receive a refund on my S&H, that has been a week ago with no credit or refund shown to my account. I attempted to contact the seller by phone three times and left a message once. No return call. I have just sent an email this morning, but I am not counting on a reply. Save yourself some aggravation and buy somewhere else. The only positive in this experience is that the part did bolt right in."
3,Rose tinted specs,"I have wanted this album, from day one (sometime in 1994). I finally got round to buying it and have mixed feelings about it. Firstly, my taste in music has evolved since 1994 (i.e. gotten heavier) so was a little bit disappointed that the rest of the album wasn't as heavy as the title track... but if you look at it from the perspective of the time it was released, it was an album that was definitely up there with some of the best metal albums of that era. It's a real shame that they're not around anymore, I bet they would still be kicking ass!"
5,Inspiring and Helpful,I am a hospice worker and I couldn't agree more with the thesis of this book about the importance of creative responses to death -- both for the dying and for the bereaved. And the stories themselves are truly inspiring.
5,Compelling Stories,This book has many compelling stories in it. I stayed up reading it until 2AM the first night and finished the whole book the second night. It shows that one way people can endure devastating loss is by using their creativity -- designing commemorative art and personal rituals and even by telling stories.
1,something between radiohead and backstreet boys,"I bought this album because I'm a fan of Naohito Fujiki.That's the only reason why I bother to search for his album.His songs are not versatile, not noisy, monotonic-- they sounds alike from the first track to the last. You can play the entire album without knowing the endings of each songs.If you're really not a fan of Nao, I suggest you not to waste your money this album."
1,DO NOT BUY!!! SPEND THE EXTRA $6 AND GET THE ENERGIZER 7 LED TRAILFINDER HEADLAMP!!!,I ordered this to use for work on automobiles and for my job because I service vehicle Dynamometers and work in dark pits where the equipment and electronics are located. I knew I was returning it as soon as I took it out of the box! There was white powder all over it and most of the silver paint on the swiveling LED lamp head was flaked off. It is the biggest piece of crap I have ever seen.DO NOT waste your time saving a couple bucks. In the same order that I got this I also ordered an Energizer 7 LED headlamp and the quality and light output difference is absolutely night and day.Spend the extra $6-$10 and get a QUALITY LED headlamp.If I could rate 0 stars I would!
5,Always satisfied,"My orders always arrive within 3 days and they are always in excellent condition. This is what I call""Excellent Service""! They know how to keep a customer happy."
3,Essential reading for those in Andean studies.,"Eight months of the year I live in Andes, in small farming community, three hours from Cusco, Peru. I sought-out this text to enrich my historical and ethnographical understanding of Peru, but after plowing through professor Mayer's erudite monograph on Andean peasant economies I came away with little practical knowledge that would help better understand the campesinas in my community.That is not to say that Professor Mayer work is not valuable. The text provides a quantitative and empirical study of Andean households as economic agents, and for social science theorists, those in academia and upper division students of Andean studies `The Articulated Peasant' will be essential reading. There is a short Spanish/Quechua glossary, a good index and ample biography."
2,Duke Togo has just been shot Down,"Queen who? Could this be the end of Golgo 13? Movie wise, I think so. This movie lacked everthing the original was. The animation was better than the origianl in some aspects. What was up with the music. Surely better music could have been dug up. (How about a hyped up version of the NES game music)What was with the story? Anyone could have created a better script than that. If this movie did not contain Golgo 13, it would have gotten no stars!"
2,Just Long Enough,"This movie left a lot to be desired. The music was funny stuff (although I'm sure that wasn't intentional) and the animation was so-so. Although I have to say in all fairness my first few animé films were Akira, Ninja Scroll and Wings Of Honnemaise which isn't a fair comparison.I thought the plot was alright. I've seen sillier plots in a Jean Claude Van Damme movie but it really didn't excite me much. I really found the technique of stopping the action for a comic book style drawing annoying. I like my action straight forward and this seemed a little too artsy. I also found the sex needlessly over done. I know this is animé so you need gratuitious sex and violence but cartoon sex has never been that exciting to me and it kind of brought the action to a halt.Golgo 13 was just okay."
4,A good addition to the story of Golgo 13,"This anime is a good follow up to the Proffesional: Golgo 13. The animation is, of course, much better than its predesessor. It has a good story, with plenty of plot twists and violence to keep you going. But I recommend that you rent the Professional Golgo 13 before you decide to take this one home with you. There is plenty of nudity too. Alot of violence for 60 minutes, I believe this movie is a little too short."
1,Truly Awful,"Definitely a new all time low for anime. I can't believe that I actually bought this.The animation is very poorly done. The action scenes are the worst I have ever seen in anime. The story is also very poor, and the characters are unconvincing.Bottom line: If somebody vomited onto a DVD, this would be the result."
1,WASTE OF MONEY!,"i hated this video so much that i would have given it only 1/2 a star. its okay to have 1 or maybe even two adult scenes but they completely overdoit here!the only reason i would give this half a star is because i like the idea that people are trying to renew the old anime and some of it is pretty dam gud.the plot is sort of unclear but maybe its just that i havent watched it in a few weeks.id say this is for the people who like the old japanese moovees with alot of ""those type""of scenes, ( Why did I put those words in quotes? i don't know) im not saying those kind of people are bad, heck i have a friend just like that, i guess its just not for me. i would rather have my money back and return this movie."
3,"Not bad,but nowhere near ""The Professional"".","It's been awhile since the last Golgo 13 anime,and he is back. This is much shorter than the old Professional:Golgo 13,and the movie isn't as unique or interesting. The overall plot is kinda nifty,but at times it felt too much like an uninspired Rambo-type movie. No cool enemies this time"
2,Not worth it,"I enjoyed the Professional:Golgo 13 enough to buy this on DVD. Please be aware of the fact that this film is only 60 minutes long if you are considering buying it. I stupidly did not check that detail before my purchase. This film is decent enough. If you are a fan of the first film it is not a complete waste of time. But, it is not nearly as interesting as the first in my opinion, in that it seems more like a watered down version of the Professional. The interaction between the Queen Bee and Golgo is similar enough to his assignment on the rich heiress of the first one to not feel that new, and the psychotic ex marine killer is not nearly as fun to watch as Silver&Gold or Snake from the first. Definately not worth the $..., maybe if it sold for cheaper and you had to complete your collection."
5,Helpful video for children dealing with death,"I have 2 older children that loved this video because the story was about Davey's grandmother who died, just this year my children's grandmother died it helped them alot to deal with death just the same way Davey was with his grandmother. It's very sad but very real & understanding. Please watch this video with your children. I grew up with Davey & Goliath. May God Bless you."
1,piece of junk. two corners ripped out the first time I used it. thank god for the Amazon return policy - got my $$ back.,Piece of junk. two corners ripped out the first time I used it. thank god for the Amazon return policy - got my $$ back.I'm surprised Rain-X would put their name on something this bad.
2,Kinda small,It is def water proof but I wish it was bigger. Also I have an Equinox so the straps did not fasten onto my roof rack. Plastic straps were too small. I bought 4 bungees from Home Depot and that did the trick.
4,Waterproof....about it,This is a nice bag. Very thick....waterproof! I did drive in a rain storm and was afraid that everything would be soaked...but to my surprise everything was dry!It is a pain in the butt to get everything in it. Would would suggest some type of re-enforcement so it would somewhat stand on it's own.At the end of the day......not a bad bag at all!!
1,Seams busted on first trip. Don't buy this,"The ONLY things I put in the bag were 2 camp cots - very lightweight. The bag, as others note, is stiff, but what's worse is that the zippers are made of VERY pliable metal. They bent like a spoon in Uri Geller's hands. I noticed after the first leg of the trip (about 500 miles) that small holes had worn through where the roof rack met the bag. The noise from the bag (not the straps, which I tightened and taped) hitting the roof was like listening to a speedbag, for hours. By the time we returned, there was a 4-inch failure of the front seam, and another 2-inch gap in the rear.I can't recommend this product to anyone. I've put photos of the zippers and seams so you can see for yourself"
3,Rain X bag- ok but difficult to use,"This product was difficult to use. The zippers are very hard to close and we broke one off before we ever left for our trip, just trying to zip it up (thank goodness there are two zippers). We even under packed it.Once packed and strapped down it was great. The advertisement states it is rain proof, in reality the packaging states rain resistant. We were lucky enough not to have rain, however we did experience heavy snow and our items stayed dry.Over all it was an ok product, just difficult to close when it is on top of the car."
4,Top Cargo Bag makes an impact,This bag came when I expected it and was easy to install on the car roof. We had to improvise on how to connect the straps to our Caravan roof rack because the clips would fit between the space between the roof rack and the van's roof. It worked out in the end.
2,"Okay, but zipper broke","The zipper broke the first time I tried to zip it shut on the car. It was not even totally full of stuff. It was just so hard to zip shut that, while pulling on the zipper, it broke in half. Good thing it has two zippers, but still, not cool. It did hold up with the one zipper, but would be nice to have two. It also did not hold as much as I thought it would. My recommendation would be to zip it up and unzip it several times in your warm home before ever putting it on a car. It has a rubber-ish material all over the zipper (that makes it waterproof) and after opening and closing it a few times becomes easier and easier."
4,"Well made, but not as roomy as other hard top carriers...","This is a durable, well made carrier. The major down side is that it is not has large as many hard-case carriers. I was only able to fit one large suitcase, two very small suitcases and some pillows in my last trip. The other thing that you also must consider is that unlike hard carriers that rest on your crossbars, the weight of your items is resting directly on the roof of your vehicle. The tie downs to the roof rack are only to keep the carrier on your vehicle, but if you put something too heavy in the carrier it may dent or damage your roof. But it is very sturdy, and very weather resistant, and a great price. Overall I'm happy with my purchase."
2,Zipper Issues,I purchased the product new and was happy to find out how thick and durable the material was. I also appreciated the velcro flaps covering the zipper. Unfortunately during the install my favorable review changed quickly. The zipper which closed the unit is cheap and broke rather easily without pressure on the seems. The pull key ripped the plastic teeth and separated from the zipper quickly on the second pull. There is no way to repair without replacing the zippper. I now must try and return the product...
4,Good carrier,Bought this for our journey to Texas. Didn't hit any rain until on the trip back. Everything stayed dry no issues. My wife even refilled the bag and the zipper didmt break
2,Zipper pulls gave out,"Love the size, volume, ease, flexibility, security, and of course the price. But as many other reviews here and elsewhere reveal, the metal in the zipper pulls is cheap. Bendy in hot weather and brittle in cold, they won't last.Our first one broke on the second trip. But I blamed myself, and carried pliers for the 3rd and 4th trip, so I could still get all of the great value out of my beloved (and cool looking!) RainX. Then the second pull broke. And, illustrating more commitment to the product than made sense, I *continued* using it for another half dozen trips, diligently packing the pliers for every trip. Just so that I could open the damned thing?Then it started ripping, even without being full, as discussed in other reviews, and shown in pictures posted on Amazon. I blame its relatively long life with us, on mostly fair weather and shaded parking. For mountains, heavy winds, heavy rains, snow, desert, beach, etc.? Can't recommend you do anything but find another product."
1,Any idea how to get 4 27 inch suitcases in this like advertised?,"Appears to be nice, but no diagram, and no clue how to even get close to 4 27 inch suitcases as advertised. Would love a diagram, or info to help"
3,Does the job if you have the prper size rack,"Made well & strong , but zippers are very difficult to open & close. You also need a roof rack that is wider then 36"" x 36""."
4,Well Worth the Money,"This past December I found myself in need of a cargo bag for a one time, 2000 mile drive. After researching different options (all with price tags in the $100's of dollars) I stumbled across the rain ex. I thought I would give it a try. I was shocked at how much baggage it held and how easy it was to attach and detach from my Blazer. (Although it held so much cargo that once it was off it was hard to manage due to the fact that its a bag not a shell) We went through a few rain storms and not a drop got inside. I was more than pleased with its performance and anyone who isn't simply isn't being realistic for the money. I would recommend it to anyone for one or two time use on a major trip."
3,Not bad but not great,"The fabric is pretty thick and tough and seemingly water proof. We took it on a six hour drive in light rain with no water or dampness on the inside. The biggest problem was the zipper. It can be very difficult to close especially in temperatures below 50 degrees. In cold temperatures it becomes VERY stiff. Attaching it to the vehicle requires some ""jimmying"". It requires two attachment points PER side on all 4 sides so if you have car top rails on 2 sides (front/back or side/side) you may need to get creative. Look to see if you have any holes in the rails to attach clips for the sides that may be ""missing"" rails."
2,RAIN-X,"It held what it was suppose to hold, keeping it pretty water-tight. But some very serious false advertising. Does NOT use any RAIN-X product just uses the name. It says it is water proof on the package but the info inside says that it is only water resistant. I am glad it didn't rain to test it. The straps were okay. a pain to work with."
3,Just Okay,The carrier did not hold as much luggage as I thought it would. It was difficult to load and zip. When tightening the straps on of the eyelets ripped.We did go through quite a rain storm on the way home and everything remained dry.
2,Cheap Weak Zipper Handle,"This bag seems like a very good quality thick, hard material inside and out. I loosely packed the bag with some clothing, tried to zip it before putting it on my cartop, but the zipper handle thingy came loose from the zipper. I tried to pull the other zipper to close the bag thinking I can just use one zipper handle to zip it, but that one came loose from the zipper also. Upon inspection, I noticed that the zipper handle opened, releasing it from the zipper. That thing is so thin and weak that when I pressed it closed and lightly opened it back up to put it back in the zipper line, it literally broke like a piece of cake. I don't think it's even made of metal. Maybe I got a bad batch, but it is what it is. Returned to Amazon."
5,Worth the money,"Pros: low price, kept all my stuff dry while on top of my SUV during hurricane Irene, the web system of straps keeps everything secure, Fits a fair amount of stuff.Cons:things in the bag may rattle during transit, (I had some fishing poles and sporting equipment up there) The first time setting up can take a while. (once the webbing was secured to the bag I just re-coupled the clips in loops once opened for faster set up). Black vinyl fabric can get very hot to the touch on Sunny days.For the price you can't beat this, this is really a great product."
4,Good Product and rain proof,We used this product on 2500 mile trip through heavy rain and everything inside was dry.The only thing is it could only fit one large and 2 small luggages.We have a Dodge Grand Caravan and the straps loop only around roof rack bars across. The clips are too large to loop through the side rails.
3,the bag is heavy duty it served its purpose,"The bag is heavy duty and it served its purpose. Only one trip made with it so far and I was quite happy with the capacity and sturdiness of the item. but after returning home and inspecting the bag before putting it in its storage bag I noticed the thin vinyl on the outside of the bag had started to crack (very disappointing to see) but I didn't spend hundreds of dollars on it, so as they say ""you get what you pay for"". I am going to continue using it; I really do not think a little cracked vinyl affects its usefulness. Spray some water repellent on it and move on."
3,Sticky Zipper is frusterating but the price is right.,This is a great item for the price but the zipper is a real problem. I put some silacone spray lubricant on it and that helped alot. I will definitly replace this with a hard shell cargo carrier ASAP.
4,Bigger Than It Looks,"We bought this for a weekend trip where we had more people than room in the car. We stuffed a couple of tents, five sleeping bags and quite a few other items into this cargo bag. It was a little tricky tying it to our particular roof-rack and we had to employ a work-around, but it was really no big deal. Overall we are very satisfied with it."
1,Buyer beware,"When I installed the rooftop cargo carrier for the first time, two of the PLASTIC locking clips broke. I used bungie cords as substitutes.The bag is made of heavy duty weather resistant material.Loading for the return trip, one of the zipper pull tabs broke. I used the other ziper pull tab to zip the bag shut. When I arrived home, the second zipper pull tab broke. I'm contacting the manufacturer to return the product for a refund."
1,a total rip off,Only two bags fit in it and the zipper almost busted. The straps pop off when attempting to strap on top. Funny thing was another car at rest area was trying to fix his for same issue!!
4,only one complaint,"we read all the previous reviews before choosing this product. The bag itself is very durable, thick material. Yes the zipper sticks a little, but it's nothing to cry about. The only problem we had with this bag was the straps. By the time we reached our destination 1780 miles from home, the straps had started to shred, we were a little worried about the ride home, but it withstood the conditions. I would still definately reccommend this bag!"
4,Great product,We purchased 2 of these to bring our daughter to college 1200 miles away. While on this trip we also camped as a family and visited friends in the area. We packed much of her belongings and camp gear into the bags and put them on top of our Astro van. Two fit perfectly and held most of our stuff. We had extra straps we used to make sure nothing came loose. No problems at all. It rained two days of travel and everything stayed dry. Secure straps if you don't like the sound of them flapping around.
3,Rain-X Roof Top Bag,"Heavy duty bag that is very water resistant. Becomes very stiff and hard to zip closed in cool weather. Bent a zipper tab fighting to get it closed. The tie-down net is a very good feature, ensures the load is secure. Suggest using with a mat to prevent scratching the roof."
4,Must have been one of her first books?,"I'm not sure how to describe this exactly: it was an okay book, but I was sort of disapointed. It sounded very young, like maybe it was one of her first books. But that doesn't make since, since she was writing books in the 80s. Go figure. Anyway, I would recommend this book for preteens, and not really for people have read a lot of her other books, because you'll be let down, I garuntee it. The characters are thin, and the suspense isn't very well built. But, since the ending was pretty cool, and she IS my fave author, I'll give it 4 stars."
5,Telos: A Great Underground City Of Light,"I enjoyed this book immensely. Having lived in the Mount Shasta area for the past several years, I can attest to the power radiating to the surface of Earth from the great underground city of Telos. The message of empowerment from its High Priest, Adama, is a goal we should never forget: ""to become a Spiritual Warrior (one who acknowledges the Light within), and to reunite humanity into ONE human family."" The thoughts expressed in this book by Dianne Robbins are superb."
1,the premise is found wanting,"The premise of the book is disturbing. Any book which tries to pass itself off as a spiritual guide and offers the beings which dwell below as models must have alot to answer. All spirits were originally created good, some rebelled against their creator and decieve humans with a false ""light"". Could these be the dwellers beneath? What make us so more advanced than the medieval European theologians who also agreed that the earth is hollow, and not filled with cities of light, but rather with cities of the damned and the apostate angels? This is not negativity, only speculation, for reality is not always nice, and the truth can be painful."
3,Hooked on Phonics with Rocky Balboa,"This is the book Rocky reads to Adrian in ""Rocky II"" (1979). So come read with Rocky!"
1,Horrible...,"The page where i ordered this product made it seem like it was a womans bathing suit. Turned out i received a childs bathing suit for both grab bags i ordered.I understand that a grab bag is going to be something where i have no choice in color or maybe even style, but there is no point if it doesnt fit. The sizes ran as if they were womens sizes....now i am stuck with two childrens bathing suits and i dont have children !"
1,Swim suit grab bag,the swim suit was so unsatisfactory looking that I didn't even try it on. it was blue striped with a totally different blue strap that didn't go with the main color of the suit. Very poor choice for a grab bag. Taught me not to use grab bag shopping from this company.
2,Not As Pictured,The suit that was sent was a TYR thick strap suit. These straps cause irritation around the nect on my daughter. I had to return it and am waiting to see if we can get a thin strap one instead.
1,Not impressed at all.,"While this book contains a plothora of information, it is presented in a terrible manner. Any reader who is not up-to-par on his/her quantum physics will be completely lost. I do howver have to give credit for some excellent graphs/illustrations. They are very informative."
1,Terrible,To read this book requires a masters in physics. This terrible grouping of eqations and terminology wasted $20 and an hour or two of my life. I read a lot of books of this genere and this was just plain bad!
4,An excellent jarred sauce,"I am very picky when it comes to things like pizza, pasta, salsa, anything with tomatoes. This sauce is my hands-down favorite when it comes to a a supermarket jarred sauce. Many moons ago I used to think the Classico brand sauces were good. It took me some taste development to realize they are the equivalent of eating at an Olive Garden. Having grown up on authentic home made Italian gravy, as they say, Victoria Marinara is smooth and rich and for a quick sauce it's a top choice. Not as expensive as Patsy's or Rao's, but blows the doors off of Bertolli, Classico and sauces of that caliber. You will be impressed. The Arrabiata is also pleasant. Highly recommended."
4,Quaint and cute,"I read this book first in the early 70's. It was quite daring then. I read it again in 2012 and it was quaint and cute. But if you want a book about the counter-culture of that era, give this a read."
5,The book that marked a time in history,The late 60's an early 70's marked an era of openness and freedom. It was a time of social experimentation and exploring one's feelings. I know of no other time like it. I had some wonderful times and some really hard times. The Harrad Experiment was the book that epitimized the feelings that many people had during those years. Robert Rimmer was in his glory and this book was his classic. A true tale of optimisism
1,comedy tonight,"this is one of the most poorly written books i have ever read. there is no character development, people behave in absurd ways that they never would in real life, and the 'journal entries' are farcical. i can't believe that anyone actually thinks this is literature. (and the sex scenes aren't even good.)"
1,Dirty book disguised as serious sociology,"In the foreward, Rimmer says he'll move the world with the right kind of lever. We should be so lucky. Read the book and wink at its descriptions of casual sex. Then sneak it into the church rummage sale in a box full of old college textbooks."
4,Sex Education for a High School Sophmore,"... the book is not without merits. It's presentation of idealistic youth in a changing culture was a refreshing reminder, for a child growing up in the age of irony and cynicism, that there was a time in America when the youth believed that change for the better was possible, an intellengcia who were educated by reading Hermann Hesse and Gibran as opposed to Hegel, Chomsky & Foucault. I have reread ""Harrad"" many times and am able to laugh at what I once thought possible and the ending, oh the ending, I still find satisfying. Although being a product of the early nineties I am admitidly a cynic verging on being apathetic I will say this, if change is at all possible, it is possible only if approached from the perspective of the ""insix"", read the book and you'll know what I mean. All in all I give ""Harrad"" four stars for even with it's faults it still portrays a time and place that one can look back on and say, ""At Least They Believed In Something."""
3,Dirty? nah....Tame!,"Still a good laugh after 35+ years. I thought it was ""dirty"" when I read it as a teenager, but what the heck, I was about 14 at the time. And you know what, the attitude towards sex, while casual, was humorous and fun and respectful and serious all at once, and that made a huge impression on me at the time. And I'm not sorry that it did.And even back then I knew it was fiction! A fun read, and as other reviewers have pointed out, a good portrait of the kind of innocent idealism so many of us shared back then."
4,Excellent Product,"Bought this for my Project Salvo. Looks very nice and performs great. I've shot 5,000+ Visible Impact Paintballs (Pink) and never broken one, accuracy and range are very consistent. Easily hit my buddy at 45 yards. Arrived in 2 days, when the minimum was 7. Only negative thing i have to say is the Barrel is a bit of a gas hog. But it's worth it."
4,Good for the money,nit as good as a flatline but much better than a stock barrel... the only complaint that i have is it will break balls like crazy when you are low on co2 other than that it is a good barrel...
2,Needs moderization,"This book contains SOME very helpful information, but the info is simply not well organized or very readable, i.e., specifically, it could truly use a wholesale re-editing & modernization of its presentation and content. Over 20 yrs. have passed since the book's publication, and most of the material would benefit substantially from a comptemporary presentation with ""reader appeal"" in mind, fresh examples, inclusion of a section on the important topic of rebuilding of trust (after extramarital affair/s), etc. This relatively expensive book is really boring, unexciting, and somewhat lacking in content, as is. That's a shame!"
3,"2 parts inspired emulation, one part vanity project","Some of these classical and jazz experiments on Zappa themes are lost in translation to over-intellectualizing, but many remain interesting and a few even keep mind-blowing compositional qualities intact."
2,Clunky and Clumsy,"I've been looking for a basic everyday set and purchased this one. Unfortunately it is as cheap as the price suggests. The sugar bowl is cute, but the creamer spout is malformed and off-center and the butter dish is difficult to use. While nice looking, because of its shape, it is very hard to grasp the lid and remove it without getting butter all over the inside of the butter dish."
5,Awesome for school,This book of plays was perfect for my high school students and a great price. The text is a good font and the notes are very helpful.
5,I don't know why this book is out of print!,"If you have ever worked with teens in a church, you know finding adult leaders can be the worst struggle of all. This book is a God-send for lay-workers volunteering in youth ministry."
5,The Avangardists Of Modern Humour,"To this day, Monty Python remains THE idol and source of inspiration to humourists all around. Monty Python's Flying Circus made the group famous, and it is the best ever to come out, not only from Monty Python, not only from Britain... but humour in general!Highlights on this tape: Children's Stories, Restaurant Sketch and Undressing In Public.Own it!"
3,Poodle Skirt,The skirt was cute but didn't last long. The felt came off shortly after the eye popped off. Tried glueing it back on but they would not stay on. This outfit had not been washed so that was not the cause. Served its purpose but wouldn't buy again.
1,Don't even bother,"This book is a total departure from his other works. A huge disappointment. I, too, wish I had not read it and encourage you not to waste your time."
4,Great Band,"Is not the better disc of Chastain, but the most notable is the great work of the singer kate chastain, go for more."
1,Hope you like yellow pictures,"I purchased this camera hoping that Sony electronics and Carl Zeiss lenses would make for a great camera. Unfortunately, this camera takes poorly colored pictures. I found out after I bought it, that Sony is having production problems with this camera and they have not worked them out. The Sony repair people acknowledge that the pictures that this camera takes have yellowish tones, but they claim that is ""normal"" for this camera and will not refund or replace the camera. Buy this camera only if you want to play around with lighting to get moderately decent pictures."
2,Poor reliabilty,This is my third Sony digital camera. These cameras have a short lifetime. The first 2 cameras did not last long. I have had this camera repaired for dark pictures while using the flash. Presetly when using the optical zoom the view finder is unable to adjust and the image is very blurry. I do not use the digital zoom.
5,"After over a year of research, I made the right decision.","I've had this camera for about a month now. It has all the features I needed and a few I still haven't tried. Some people mentioned problems they had, but I didn't have any. I love that you can buy lenses to expand the features of the camera. If you are unfamiliar with using a camera like this, you may want to see if your cable provider has free videos explaining the features. We have i-control here and there are several videos that can help you get the most out of your camera."
2,Great Pictures when they are not blurry....,I've owned this camera for a while now and am in the process of getting rid of it and getting a new camera. The biggest problem with this camera is its small size. This camera repeatedly takes blurry pictures due to primarily two reasons..Reason 1) When holding the camera it is very easy to get your finger in the way or partially blocking the flash causing it to not flash all the way or flash out of sync so the picture turns out blurry.Reason 2) Even for us young fella's with rock solid hands it's hard to hold this camera still enough to keep it from shaking ever so slightly and causing blurry pictures. Couple that with its small aperature size and you have to be extremely still to get a crystal clear picture.
2,Watch Out for the Battery/Memory Card Door.,"I am still giving this camera 2 Stars because... I may have used the wrong settings when taking photo's.But... I ended up with ""a lot"" of blurred and fuzzy photo's. ""example... when we went bowling, almost every photo was blurred or had those acid trip looking streaks.""My Biggest complaint is the battery door broke completely in half in less then 4 months of use.You might expect that out of a $30 Dollar Camera but ""NOT"" a $3 Hundred Dollar one.I paid $284.99 for the camera, $47.99 for the 1 GB SD Memory Card and $51.54 for the Docking Station and that didn't include S&H; or Taxes, they were extra $$$!My husband replaced this one for me with the Kodak EasyShare C743 and G600 printer dock and it's a 7.1 MP and it takes better quality pictures that I can print @ home for less then this one. ($249.95 W/FREE Shipping & Handling and 1 GB SD Memory Card included) from K O D A K online."
1,Too many problems to get good pics,"I had the hardest time trying to get clear pictures with too much light or at night. The pics are coming blurry. I am not happy with this camera, it not easy to use at all. Even though I have a friend that has the same camara and tried with the same pics, my pics came out totally unfocus, with black lines, dark, etc, etc. I don't know if its only my camara, but for me, didn't work out."
5,Best camera I've ever owned,"I bought the DSC P 200 last year, after spending thousands of hours reading these reviews!!! and I've never had a better camera. So, thanks to everyone who reviewed this camera, and recommended it. This camera takes credible photos from the inside of the car, with the window closed, going 60mph! It fits in your pocket, and stays charged up for days. There are lots of features that I still have not figured out, but all you need to do is point, click and you get a great photo."
3,be very careful..,the slightest bump causes the lens to malfunction. the camera isnt that easy to use. Mine is in a box ready to ship back for the second time to fix the lens. an expensive camera with too sensitive lens. i think a simpler camera may work as well. it does take good pics once you get it figured out though.
2,"50% Handy, 50% Junk","I bought this camera to take photos of my paintings to print off. I had read reviews about the camera being blurry at times, but I never thought it'd be a problem since I don't have very shaky hands. Yet even standing still, I had problems with getting crisp pictures with accurate colors. I skimmed through several of the different settings, but the camera still produced inconsistent results. Some of the photos looked great while others I immediately deleted. In the end, I went back to my old reliable digital camera.The camera does have some fantastic features, though. It has wonderful battery-life and charges up quickly. The movie features are pretty nice too for a digital camera. The mpegs are not DVD quality, but they are fun to pass around the internet. It also is small, but has a huge LCD screen for its size. It would be the perfect camera if it didn't have such a big problem with blurred pictures."
4,perfect....except that darn flash,"this is a great camera in most aspects. 7 megapixels is an awesome setting if you want professional photos, but other than that the 5 and 3 will work fine. the only complaint is the darn flash. It sad that such a great camera will only produce around 1/2 good photos when taken at night. The flash seems to be horribly out of synch, but when it works (which is whenever it feels like it) the photos are great. If you're using this for daytime, its worth the money. If not, i recommend buying a large memory stick (256mb i use) and dealing with it. We were told this is probably one of the best sony cameras, so if you are a diehard sony fan and want to stay in the $400 range...this is the camera for you"
2,Don't buy this camera,"I bought this camera to replace my Canon Powershot 5MP that seemed to have constant red-eye problems, and I am so sorry I bought it. I have the exact same problem with this camera that other people have described in their reviews. The flash is often out of synch, so pictures are either over exposed, or else totally dark. Also, the slightest movement causes the pictures to blur, and hence, otherwise picture perfect moments are totally ruined. This is my third digital camera and I've never had these problems with any other camera. If you want to take pictures of still objects outdoors in daylight, the pictures are fabulous, but otherwise, this camera is just awful."
1,"Blurry, blurry, blurry...","I have sent my DSC-P200 back to Sony twice for repair, as it is taking approx. 25% of the pictures either blurry, out of focus, or with odd motion trails. Yet, they claim the camera works perfect. My past two Sony's and my Nikon had no such issue-- so did I suddenly forget how to take a picture? Sony thinks that is the case. I'll let you judge for yourself - visit www.myblurrycamera.com and see real life examples for yourself! I'd look elsewhere rather than take a chance with this model..."
4,Sony Cybershot DSCP200 7.2MP Digital Camera 3x Optical Zoom,"Overall I think this will be an excellent camera. I think as a first time digital camera user, it has a lot of options and my daughter and I could not believe how detailed the photo of her dog came out as we closed in on his face. It was amazing. The only thing I don't like is the little door to recharge the battery does not seem to be something that will hold up for the life of the camera. I'm afraid it will break apart eventually and that is the one thing I do not like. For the price of the camera, I think this should have been better made. I am really disappointed with Sony at this feature."
4,Nice Little Camera.= Just what I wanted. Thanks Amazon,"It is light, easy to use, and has an understadable system of menus. The Amazon vendor supplied extra memory and I run out of battery now before I run out of memory. Nice."
4,worth every penny,It is one of the best thing that I've ever bought. The clarity of pictures and the simplicity of using are worth every penny I paided to buy this camera. The long lasting battery is also one of the best features of this camera. The flashing light makes the pictures as bright as nature.The only thing that I did not like is the size; it doesn't fit in most types of pockets. I strongly recommand this amazing camera.
2,during the rare times that it does get the shot it is great...,"but 50% of the time it is very blurry. i bought this to go with my sony vaio (wonderful), but it has sent me running back to my old faithful- cannon- read all reviews and think seriously about whether or not you can take the chance of missing the shot (kids, wedding, vacations, et cetera). every once it a while the shot is outstanding, but more times than not...i'm very dissappointed."
1,spots + blur,"This camera has just been banned from the Chinese market because it was found to be defective. Sony even bribed Chinese journalists to hush the issue.I've had mine for nearly a year now. I've had to get it fixed twice for dark spots. This is because dirt/dust gets into the camera and onto the CCD. In short, this camera is not airtight. You need to keep it in a sealed pouch at all times. Once the camera came back from being service, it was not even properly cleaned (check comments here for someone to who the same thing happened). So they changed the whole optical unit.Now the camera gives blurry pictures when using the zoom. This is systematic, even if the camera is on a tripod, even if the object photographed is very far and you manually set the focus on infinity.This camera is a piece of junk. Don't buy it, and seeing the long list of cameras that were banned along with it, don't buy Sony."
4,4 1/2 stars,i hav a camera like this and its about4-5 years old. works really well but the flash doesn't work well anymore. but that's not bad for 5 years of constant use.
3,Lens Problems,"My second DSC-P200 just quit working, and it was the same as my first one.....the lens is stuck and won't emerge from the housing. The power switch works and the unit tries to push the lens out, but something is stopping it. I did get a few years out of the first one, and almost 4 out of the second, so I'm not bashing Sony too much. Other than that, it is a great camera."
3,Nice in perfect conditions,"I love this camera for taking photos in ideal conditions. However, I have had the same problems as another reviewer - using the zoom in dimmer light - fuzzy pics. It just will not focus - goes in and out. In fact, now all the photos taken with zoom are fuzzy - even in sunlight. And the flash causes the pic to be black. I have had to turn the flash off entirely to keep it from ruining the pics. I am very disappointed because I would love to use the zoom in indoor or outdoor events - but this just does not work at all."
2,Wish this camera was build to LAST!,"This camera was an awesome little camera. I loved the features. But it broke on me after 250 pictures. I had to take it back. The flash was not working on it. It either took all black pictures or all white pictures. I wanted to buy another one, but apparently that was a common problem. So while the features worked great, easy to use good size and shape...I will not be getting another one due to all the problems it has."
4,"Overall, Nice Camera","If you're thinking of buying this camera... I have a few things for you to be concious of beforehand.1) If you're going to be taking sports pictures (of your kids, or whoever!) and you're indoors our outdoors on a darker day or under lights, the camera does not take any decent pictures. They're all too dark. This was one big disappointment for me, regardless if you're in sportsmode (this acutally makes it worse) or just taking the photo in the normal mode.. it doesn't come out. If this is one major thing you're planning on doing with the camera I would re-consider.2)The zoom isn't what it could be -- at times it's a little frustrating at how little distance 3x really is. Just a thought.Overall, I love the camera. I highly recommend getting a big memory card so you can go a long weekend/vacation without worrying about going over!"
3,Good for students I guess,"I wanted to be able to remember to take the trash out in the morning... this book teaches you how to remember that Lolita was written in 1958. Basically it uses word associations -- things like coming up with a little song (""In 1492 Columbus sailed the ocean blue"") or mnemonics (to remember that the elemental symbol for Tin is Sn, picture a tin snake so whenever you think of tin you think of a Snake). Then it teaches how to use this stuff to remember strings of numbers, dates, etc. Probably pretty useful for a schoolkid, but not for me. Also, this book is really better suited to the printed format because it has quizzes and stuff where you're supposed to sit there and study a set of numbers before flipping to the next page and seeing how much you remember -- a lot easier to look up and down the page than it is to rewind the audiobook over and over."
3,"Good, but disappointing","Let me make this clear: Improve Your Memory will help you if you don't know anything about the subject (i.e. about memory), however there are better books with more techniques. It also disappointed me when compared to the others in the series.It has the advantage of being clearly written (though keeps repeating things that are written in the other books by Fry, which is a fault of all books in the series) and I believe it is a perfect book for high school. But if you already know about association techniques you should find another book.As for the series, they are very informative, however very repetitive. They could easily be trimmed into a book of approximately the same size as each individual volume. They are cheap, but if instead of many you had to buy only one they would be cheaper."
5,A beautiful piece of artwork!,"In my mind, golf is a game of art. So what would be better than purchasing a gorgeous painting of a golf course? NOTHING! I hung this piece of artwork just over the head of my bed and every night I dream of being there. I can only imagine what it would be like. I see myself driving the ball 300 yards straight down the fairway only to find that it hit and killed someone. Haha... idiot."
3,Good but not great,"This was a decent title all-around. The robot combat is nothing spectacular but is not bad. There's some strong language in this video. The voice-acting is not exactly top-notch. The girls are kind of ditsy, but it's done for laughs and is fairly funny. The villain is as despicable as any I've seen in anime so far. He's very brutal to women, but actually has a semi-logical reason for the things he does (though that's not revealed until a later volume). The most noteworthy aspect of this video is the nudity. The women get naked quite a bit, and it's up to you to decide whether this is for you. Personally, I loved it. There's also some lesbian innuendo. Overall I've seen much better movies, but if you're looking for a decent sci-fi anime with a lot of naked women, this is a good pick."
2,"Cute, but cheaply made","Expensive, yet cheaply made with flimsy material. The model is showing the dress with a full petticoat. When I received the dress, it wasn't as pictured, so I had to buy a full petticoat, PLUS I had to look all over town for a red headband, frilly white socks, and black shoes. Nevertheless my daughter looked cute for Halloween, but I had to fork over $50 for the dress from amazon, then I had to spend more money finding accessories. For that price, they should have included some accessories like many other Halloween costumes do."
5,"Disciplined, Lively, Wonderful","What a great recording! The Kirov Orchestra is apparently a small ensemble usual to the ballet theater. The small size of the orchestra allows the music to be wonderfully defined and precise. The orchestra is disciplined and the tempo is always perfect. Yet the music is performed in so lively a manner and so beautifully played by accomplished instrumentalists one becomes immersed in the ebb, flow and drama of the score. Nothing else impinges on your enjoyment. The CD is well recorded and of exceptional clarity. Get this CD. You will never regret it."
4,It's almost perfect (almost),"The only thin I can complain it's a tiny defect: in the track 9, at 00:38 second, there is a defect in the sound. I don't know if it's a defect of the record or it's I have de defect copy.Otherwise, it's a amazing record. The best Nutcracker I've listened. The rithm is a little fast, but it's a COMPLETE NUTCRACKER IN ONE CD. :)"
2,Left me breathless,"I purchased this recording a year ago, as a belated replacement for my old audio tape of the historical Barishikov/Kirland television performance. Yes, I read the reviews and was warned about the brisk tempo, but bought it anyway. Now, a year later, I am still breathless from exhaustion when I listen to it. The tempo is more than brisk, with no breaks between sections. Lyricism is sadly lacking in this recording. I'll be looking for a better interpretation."
2,"Great sound quality, but rushed and mechanical","The sound quality of this is just superb. However, it sounds like it was recorded by a computer with hardly any tempo variation, nuance, or pausing; just an exact metronome beat. And that beat is Roadrunner-fast. If you're impressed that it all fit on one CD, the reason is that it is played unusually fast. If you think people who don't like it that fast were all born in the '40s - well I was born in the '70s and my favorite music is rock, R&B; and jazz. But I also love classical music. This rendition is ""lively"" but robotic. True, you can't really go too far wrong with great music, and the Nutcracker is great, but I prefer a more organic, emotive performance which sounds like it's played by human beings.I have been listening to several recordings of Tchaikovsky's complete ballets recently, and by FAR the best one isTchaikovsky: The 3 Ballets. It blows all the other recordings away!"
2,OK if you like Nutcracker on speed,This is a high quality recording but entirely too fast on most of the songs. Chinese in contrast is done slowly. What were they thinking?
3,Not for everyone,"If you came to love Nutcracker from trekking out to see the ballet for Christmas, this is probably not your recording. As many others have remarked, ballet requires a certain tempo; this one is too fast. To me it sounds as if the entire orchestra was trying to finish so they could run off and catch a train. I am sure I would have a different appreciation if Nutcracker didn't equal the ballet for me, but regardless of the clever choices of the conductor, all I get are mental images of frantic dancers."
2,Don't waste your time or money,"No one could take this seriously. If you are at all familiar with the material you'll notice that it sounds like the whole orchestra is late for a hot date and can't wait to get out of the recording studio. It's not only something no one could dance to, but nothing anyone could listen to and think that this was what the composer had in mind."
1,"Higher, faster, louder fools a lot of people","I heard this recording on the radio, and could not believe that a recording company would release such a hideous performance. It is technically unsound because the tempi are so fast in many places that the notes do not speak on even the violins, much less on the viole and celli. The brass sound (especially in the trumpets) is so coarse that it hurts. I have played this piece many times with good conductors and bad ones, but I have never encountered a situation in which the music and the orchestra were so utterly degraded by an ""interpretation."" Gergiev made what is obviously a GREAT orchestra sound at best mediocre, and most of the way through, just bad. You would have to pay me in seven figures to put this atrocity in my library of recorded music. I had to put one star in the rating to publish this review, but it surely doesn't deserve even that one."
3,Fast and Furious,"It is true that this is an up tempo recording and as such it steals the moodiness inherent in the ballet as created and desired by Tchaikovsky who would not bow to the sanitised version of the original story. Having danced the role of Clara's Father and the Mouse King, I could not keep up with this tempo. As this piece has the benefit of modern metronome timing there really is no excuse. I must admit I can never understand why musicians have to meddle with original tempi. It was written to be danced to. To me this takes all the artists original creativity and lays it aside. I am surprised that the Kirov would do this. Look for something nearer the original tempo and bask in real Tchaikovsky whilst imagining the beautiful choerography of Lev Ivanov. Better still go and see the ballet."
5,A rockin' good time!,First let me say WOW!!!This recording is about as good as cd quality will allow and the performance is alive and engaging. It is as near perfect as I imagine it could be. The orchestra plays as tight as a good quartet and thier enthusiasm shows thru in spades.Even a non classical music fan will love it.
4,Good CD,I enjoyed the cd very much. I had an older cd but it was in 2 parts with the last 3 parts of the dance on the other cd. Got tired of changing out.I liked that all was on this 1 cd.The negative is that some parts they seem to race through and the Grandfather Dance is abrupt.
1,Ugh! Unrecognizable.,"I WISH I had listened to the few negative reviews. Such a waste of money. Totally unrecognizable. Like listening to an elevator music version of Jimi Hendrix. If you are looking for something that sounds at all like The Nutcracker Suite, keep looking..."
5,Great Tchaikovsky ballet,"The Nutcracker ballet from 1892 by Tchaikovsky, has some of the most famous music ever from a ballet. The ballet and the music are very popular around Christmas. The ""March"" and the ""Trepak"" are some of my favorite songs on this recording by Valery Gergiev and the Kirov Orchestra."
5,The Nutcracker-complete ballet,I have many versions of the Nutcracker. This one is simply beautiful!! Makes me want to twirl around the room.
3,Not a bad movie.,"I would say this is worth a rental, but not worth a purchase. Story was decent enough and the acting wasn't too bad, but not great either. If you're bored and don't have any other gay themed flicks on your list, give this a try."
2,Depressing movie without any redemption,"I'm canadian and love visiting, partying and even living in Montreal. However, this movie is a downward buzz kill that fails to do much than report historical facts between 1973 and 1980. The characters are dull and 2 dimensional."
3,Not Funky Enough,"Funkytown is a drama centered on the disco era. I expected more disco dancing and less drama than what I got. Funkytown, in my mind, was going to be a fun upbeat movie with lots of music. It does have a lot of music, but this is not a fun movie. It's too serious for a movie about music that's all about having a good time. I like the gay themes, though, and Justin Chatwin is hot!"
1,You don't always get what you pay for...,My opinion only - This is a cheap Chinese chrome plated core. Mine is so out-of-round that I had clearance issues with the alternator mounting bracket.
5,Tundra Wolf originally in 1975,"An incredible movie, this was entered into the Virgin Islands International Film Festival (1975) under the category 'Short Subjects'. However the Golden Venus award went to a competing movie called Cries, written by k.t. Frankovich (under her name Kay Biggers). I would like to also locate a copy of Cries, narrated by the late Sterling Holloway (original voice of Winnie the Pooh). If anyone has information, please email me at UKpoet@aol.com"
1,"Who uses Windows 3 ('95, '98) anymore!?","Caveat emptor!If you own a computer purchased or updated during the last 10 years, this software probably won't work on it..Hardly noted, is the designation for Windows 3 software. Since most computers now operate XP (much less Vista), this software won't work. Sorry I wasted $22 . . . Hopefully you won't."
3,Outdated,"I'm sure it's a great little program but unfortunately it's outdated software as it will not load or install properly on currently common windows operating systems (XP, Vista, 7). It's a shame because it has a great price and is Schoolhouse Rock which was always fun as I recall and I had wanted to introduce my kids to it."
1,Totally disappointing!,"This movie is totally disappointing! Too bad I HAD to give it one star - I wouldn't even give it that much! They completely butcher it! I am a Scarlet Pimpernel fan and was disgusted when I saw it! I've read the books and it is nothing like it!!It's a shame that it's even called ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"".What kind of disguise do you call a black coat, hat, and mask? Where did Minette come into the picture? Percy is not funny! Marguerite is rude, Chauvelin is a vile creature, Lord Tony is too short, the Prince of Whales is a nitwit and Percy is too stupid to be the Pimpernel! Did any of the script writers actually READ the book??I would not recommend this version to ANYONE!On the other hand...if you want to see a good one - get the 1982 one with Jane Seymour and Anthony Andrews. Now, THAT'S A WONDERFUL MOVIE!!"
3,did not work for intended purpose,"was trying this out to use at work and did not work, but the hunters on my staff swear by them."
2,"Good idea, needs crafstmanship, looks cool though","Some dude in the Orient stamped out some mild grade steel and unevenly ground a good shallow edge (less that 10 degree bevel is my guess) then it got plastic molded to it's handle and 'presto' out comes a good idea waiting for better materials. I thought the design was fairly intuitive and seems to lend itself to some skinning and fleshing out of game. The T-handle gives you a fair amount of push and pull strength, which is where the stars come from in my review. The knife sits nicely in its shealth - much like a handcuff case in size and weight. It packs nice and safely in this manner, so I dropped it into my hunting day-pack. I wouldn't buy this again, but I would get the similar Gerber bone saw - great handle design for that use."
3,Beautiful Pictures,"While the photographs in this book are attractive and plentiful, I was disappointed at the lack of in-depth information. The book was more of a general overview of possibilities. This would be a good book for beginning gardeners or those who wish merely an introduction to the subject.It is possible that my expectations were set too high, as Ms. Brandies has authored two previous books that, in my opinion, no Florida gardener should be without - ""The Florida Gardener's Book of Lists"" and ""Herbs and Spices for Florida Gardens: How to Grow and Enjoy Florida Plants With Special Uses."""
4,Great resource for your tropical garden,This book has spectacular pictures of tropicals! Great source of info on how to properly take cuttings from your garden to make new plants.
3,"For the Home garden, very basic","If you are intending to get professional advicing on using Tropical plants avoid this book, however if you are planning your own home garden it is a very didactic and fun to read book."
3,Too complicated for words,"Sorry to say, the book will not meet the needs of the average or above average gardener.It is meant for a landscape architect. Almost nothing is applicable to gardens in the USA."
2,WHERE HAVE ALL THE FLOWERS GONE?,"This fragrance was received as a gift from someone who knew I enjoyed wearing floral fragrances, especially in summer. The title of this review says it all - rather than a bouquet, for me, the scent was unidentifiable. It was pleasant but didn't last."
4,Secret or not?,"Frank Klement wrote here a fascinating exploration of the various secret societies that either existed or were supposed to have existed during the American Civil War. Perhaps his most interesting idea is that most of them, including the Knights of the Golden Circle (supposed to be a model for the later KKK) never really existed outside the over-active imaginations of its founder and the professional conspiracy-hunters of the day.Is he right? I don't know. Certain people calling themselves Knights of the Gold Circle WERE active in Texas during the early days of the War. (See, for instance, Donald S. Frazier's BLOOD & TREASURE.) So, some organization calling itself the KGC really did exist.But was it the Fifth Column that it was said to be at the time? Clearly not, and Klement's take was right on that score.All in all an interesting book. Perhaps not to be read without some quibbles. But an excellent read just the same.mjt"
5,This should be a best seller for kids - I loved it!,"I love this book, it's funny. My favorite character is the quilt because its so hilarious. My favorite part is where the blanket hides behind Skinny Girl like a coward when Medallion the lion shows up. I feel like Skinny Girl was just like me. If I could I'd tell everybody to read it. I laughed a LOT! And I felt like crying at the end even though it was a good ending. I can't for the next book."
5,So Glad I Found This,"I'm so happy to find this copy, as it doesn't seem to be available at the Reading Room or on Spirituality.com. It's so useful and I know it will be a great benefit for my study."
2,sort of strong magnets,"This magnets are probably stronger than the ones you played with as a kid, but they are definitely not what I think of when I see the words 'ceramic magnets'. The magnet strength was marginal; these were not capable of holding up my dust collection bag on my tablesaw. I used some others -same size- I got at Radio shack and those were much more powerful and held it up much better."
3,Would not purchase this product again,"The magnets are weak, just enough for a single piece of paper. I was expecting a stronger hold - as has been my experience with other ceramic magnets. If you're looking to hold up the latest construction paper masterpiece from your child, keep looking."
5,INSANE!!!!!!!!!!,"An absolute motorhead must have!!!!! A greatly under rated disc from the boys, and when you ad in the live show from '83....you can't go wrong!"
2,"Great album , harsh sound","Great album from motorhead , too bad the reamster is so awfull !! Harsh & very digital sounding , they took all the magic out of a classic as they did with all the 2-cd versions ................hey Sanctuary i want my $$$ back !! these are un-listenable .Cool 2nd live cd though , very raw recording , but cool to have .........."
4,Another Perfect Day expanded edition,"Great album the 80s from Motörhead,live disc from 1983 with Brian Robertson on guitar is great bonus for Motörhead fans,quality is not the best but who cares its Motörhead"
4,Keeps your dog entertained,"Keeps your dog entertained while you are gone. I like this product overall.My only criticism is that when placed on a countertop above the floor, when the Kong comes out and bounces off the floor, sometimes peanut butter or pieces of treats that are not well secured in Kong splatter or roll under your fridge, oven etc. This can be solved by using the Kong brand treats which fit snuggly in the Kong or placing the dispenser on the ground. My only fear of placing it on the ground is my dog getting bored and trying to attack the dispenser!"
2,Great locks,"Great locks. Exactly what I was looking for. Note that these are actually 4-dial locks as pictured and not 3-dial as mentioned in the technical details. I bought these from the seller BrandshopperStores.The amazon listing for these clearly says SKB, so the problem the reviewer that thought these were Samsonite locks has been fixed.Edit:After a couple months one of the locks is starting to fail. I can no longer recommend these locks."
1,"Donnie, what were you thinking?!","This really is poor. Donnie Yen is an incredible martial artist. Billy Chow has chops too. But the film sucks. The stars are wasted. Dreadful story - usually to be expected as it's Hong Kong Cinema - but where's the thrilling choreography that makes up for the limits of a HK story? Further, my copy was faulty, (it skipped) which only added to the grief. There are a couple of decent moves, not fights, just moves, but, really, give this one a miss."
3,Iron Monkey 2,"After seeing Iron Monkey I thought the sequel would be just as good, but the DVD that I received for Iron Monkey 2 didn't even have Donnie Yen in it. It was an ok movie but I was to say the least disappointed. It is advertised with Donnie Yen's picture on the front cover on the website, but that was not what I received."
1,Iron Monkey 2,"This was probably one of the worst martial arts movies out there. It has NOTHING to do with the original Iron Monkey which was an excellent movie. Then it says it stars Donnie YEN, when in fact it stars Donnie YEH. If I could I would give it a minus star. I say don't waste your time or money."
4,"umm, yeah","This is not a sequel to the Yuen Woo Ping ""Iron Monkey"", but an entirely different story that takes place in Republic-era Shanghai with Donnie playing the Iron Monkey character. In addition to his usual excellent kickboxing, Donnie's wing chun is very pronounced. The co-hero is a very good wu shu stylist. Many scenes are sped up, in some places way too much. But what the players do is impressive. Would be a 5 if it wasn't a dub."
2,the editorial review actually does a good job in reviewing this movie,"Donnie Yen, Billy Chow, and two other guys that can fight almost as good as them. The fight scenes in this movie are good for seconds at atime, but nothing happens in this movie, and it's easily one of the worst directed movies ever, actually pretty amazing how bad this is."
1,DON'T purchase this DVD. You will be dissappointed.,"I should have read the reviews before I made a purchase of this DVD. I was totally discussed with this movie. I couldn't agree more with all the comments of the other reviewers, but my impulse got the best of me. I was just browsing in the store and I saw ""Iron Monkey 2"" with Donnie Yen. I had to buy it. What a mistake. Usually, the kung-fu movie plots are not so great, but this one was really terrible. I wasn't sure if it was suppose to be a comedy or an action film. The DVD version of this film was the worst I've seen. It was like sitting in the front row in the theater with binoculars. I couldn't follow and see the details of the fight scenes. As far as I'm concern, the lead actor could have been David Carradine and it would have made no difference.I've learned my lesson. I will read reviews before making any purchases of DVDs and not judge a movie by its cover."
2,NOT a Sequel To Iron Monkey!,"This is a run of the mill Hong Kong Actioner, and if you're a fan, you'll probably enjoy it, although not much. Donnie Yen is good, the action and fighting sequences are good, Yuen Wo Ping did design the fights. But the filming, editing, and overall quality are mediocre (fans expect this sort of low budget quality in most HK action films). I really believe this is Tai Seng's attempt to cash in on the popularity of Iron Monkey. Frankly, they've done a poor job, as any serious fan will detect absolutely no connection to that story and this."
1,Really Bad,I felt so sorry for Mr. Yen being in this so called sequel. Please don't judge this movie in the same light of the original. If you do. You will be greatly disappointed.
2,don't let the name fool you,"Pretty standard low-budget HK actioner. The production quality is no where near the Quentin Tarantino presentation of ""Iron Monkey."" Feels like they took an old movie and repacked it for IM fans. Yuen Wo Ping is credited with the fight direction which is good. Acting directing is poor to mediocre at best... It is good to see more of Donny Yen, but I'd like to see more of him in some higher quality films, like a CTHD follow-up, Matrix-style or Jet Li film."
4,Joe Stump,"I thought this was a great way to purchase music. The product is just as good as buying an actual CD. I would highly recommend amazon for purchases, my only concern is the shipping time. In this case it was not a concern!"
3,Vague tutorials!,"I must agree with the last reviewer. The author's attempt to explain the various techniques are vague. This book is supposed to be directed at all facets of expertise. Where it falls by the wayside is that it assumes you already know where the features of the program are. They tell you to go ""here"" but don't tell you where ""here"" is. For those reviewers that have the idea that this type of explaination is satisfactory it's not. The purpose of books like these are to explain things to the most novice of users. If you are unfamiliar with the program I would suggest reading some of the Thompson Learning books or go to the Discreet site and order there Tutorial DVD's. This book contains many tutorials and information but it lacks information for the newbie."
2,i've found,"that books are very dry, and hard to learn from. stick with VIDEO tutorials. there are a TON of them on the net. but yes, seriously, video tutorials are where it's at. nothing is ever left out, you can see where they clicked. and how they got their results EXACTLY!"
2,Not much help to the beginner,"As a person trying to learn a new program from scratch, this book was not helpful as it should've been. Aside from the MAX interface and toolbar explanations, this book did not do much in explaining key functions. I understand one book, no matter how many pages it has, is not enough to explain in detail a complex program like MAX, but this book was just not helpful to me. I found the tutorials that come shipped with the 3ds MAX software to be much more user friendly and in-depth. In fact, I learned how to use the program mostly through the software tutorials than any reference books. If you are familiar with the format of the Wiley ""Bibles"" and like it, than buy this book. For me, this is my third ""Bible"" series from Wiley and I have not been satisfied with any one of them.amassingdesign.blogspot"
2,Weak tutorials .. detailed reference,"A huge, boring refence-style tome...I am not sure if it can be useful in any way.. the tutorials are toosimple or to ""mechanical"" to be a good learning instrument for the Max newbie, and the theory is very ample but not deep enough to beuseful to the expert. Not recommended unless you are a UI maniac interested in the name of every single button and menu item of the huge Max interface."
3,Useful as a reference book,If you are a advanced user like myself you will learn very little from this book BUT it is incredibly useful as a reference book because it explains everything within the studio max interface (except max-script). For example it will even explain what the phisical scale roll within the radiosity using interface does in a fair amount of detail. It is also useful in explaining the different cahnges within the MAX interface. It is not really usefull however in learning complex modeling techniques and suchlike. The tutorials are also just too easy (e.g. Modelling a shell) and will not satisfy the advanced user. Very good reference book though
2,mediocre at best,"I'm a pro max user and I'd have to agree with previous reviewers that this book is just plain boring and poorly organized. Then again it's not a good 'reference' either as a successful reference makes no pretenses of being boring or not because it must function as a kind of a matrix style index that describes in detail the specific functions of the program. Unfortunately such a book does not exist so I had to settle for this title that sits so awkwardly between being a tutorial and a reference. By the way, don't use this as a tutorial because it gives you examples of objects that are already constructed (on the CD) while only barely hinting at how to actually construct them. If you know that purchasing this title (I'd get it used) is merely a provisional purchase for intermediate users, then it would be worth getting to fill out your already existing prowess in the program."
1,Greatest Heroes Of The Bible,"This Movie had great color and surrounding content. The Actors were of better than usual sincerity, but could have done better. As for the accuracy of Scripture, much was lacking. A lot of historical events of more importance were omitted and should have been given more consideration. There have been few movies where the Bible is presented that Scholarly concerns have been at the forefront. For the mosy part , the movie was of some importance and did shed some light on what scripture was trying to say. Since no one is perfect, I guess there is always room for improvement."
1,Greatest Heroes Of The Bible,This Movie has great color and background content. It is lacking in authenticity of facts as recorded in the Bible. There was a lot left out and not covered as concerning the Life of Samson and others. The Ten Commandments of Cecil B. Demile was much better and had more factual content than a movie of this caliber. It seemed as if the Producer was trying to create a fast event movie that would attract a less informed audience than those who are Bible Scholars.Accuracy is a must with Bible Scholars. R.C. Timms
4,"Great fun, flimsy construction","My daughter LOVES this vet center. She didn't even want to open the rest of her Christmas presents when she saw this. The construction of it is kinda cheap and flimsy, but easily put back together."
4,"Cute and fun, but not Little Tikes","Bought this for my niece who is 3. She liked the whole idea of playing doctor with her stuffed animals and the x-rays were awesome. But alas, this is not Little Tikes quality, so the x-rays didn't last long and the structure was not on the sturdy side."
4,lots of numbers,"Though the plot was somewhat thin and didn't hold together all that well, what this book lacks in literary merit it more than makes up for with numbers.Though there are plenty of large numbers, like 347,991, all the numbers you remember from childhood are also present. The number 9 is a scene-stealer, as usual. I'm told that the Count from Sesame Street had a hand in the editing, and I was able to detect his influence here and there.My only suggestion is that there should be a character map at the begining of the book, like they have at the beginning of a play. Whenever the number 5.4% came up, I racked my brains trying to remember if that was the same 5.4% that had appeared a hundred pages ago as the unemployment rate. Or was it rate of increase in air pollution measurements over major urban areas? I don't know. But a quick character map would have cleared it right up, saving me a lot of flipping back and forth."
3,"Very passionate, experiential and interesting","A very cool book, especially about his experiences spending a night alone in the great pyramid. Don't expect scholarly, scientific-type writing. This is a personal work, full of thoughts and observations of a culture rapidly being erased by the West. Very interesting, especially the story about the fakir/magician who can suspend his body for days, weeks, even years at a time."
3,If it ain't broke why fix it?,"I must admit I was a little dissapointed. When I heard these guys were in the studio I thought they would be releasing an album of entirely new material, however there are only four new songs. The remaining songs all appear on the album Permission to build, which is a great album in its own right. For some reason Frank and the boys felt they needed to rerecord the songs from permission to build. Why? The new versions sound over produced and a little slower. If you don't own anything by the band, purchase Permission to build, it has more of how this band really sounds live on stage which is F@*king AWSOME. Overall it is a good record, and for those that have never seen the band live or heard Permission to build will be quite pleased."
2,just my opinion,"Previous review gives excellent listing detail on what to expect in terms of projects and tips.I bought the dvd set sadly to get a recipe for the scrumptous looking drink and dessert pictured on the cover. It's nowhere to be found in either of the 2 dvds.Overall, as an intermediate level do it yourselfer and crafter i am glad i did not pay full price for this Dvd.I liked some of the projects eg, making a bag out of a beach towel, the showercurtain game and the sponge waterball, as well the tips on grilling.Overall though some of the projects are alittle too ""simple"". For example, making ""iced coffee"" literally shows Martha pouring already made hot coffee into a cup of ice and adding suger and milk to taste...to me it was bordering absurd."
4,Buy it.,"If you enjoyed the Non Zero Sumness, you will enjoy this album. It is a little less in your face with the boom, and the boom is missed. But the album offers growth, change of pace and quite a few quality tracks. 9 of the 13 tracks are very good. Personal note - fantastic album to drive to. Peak, Inhuman Perfection, Come Alive are all very good and not mentioned in the other reviews. Don't waste your time with single track purchases, the whole album has a nice flow."
2,Not even close to their first album,"After listening to a couple of hits on the radio I got this album thinking it could be as good as Non Zero Sumness, it was not.Songs like ""Stop Me"" and ""Come Alive"" are the only ones in the record that maybe you want to hear more than once for a while, but that's it, you can keep the rest. Songs like ""Inhuman Perfection"" and ""Out On The Dancefloor"" are really bad and ""Peak"" pretends to be the new ""Who Said"", but this one's cheap and boring.I keep listening to the first album. I know they are very young as a band yet but this is not their best effort."
1,the worst allergy pill,"benadryl truely is the worst pill for your allergies. Thats probably why so many people suffer from allergies in the united states. Most people take this when they get allergies and it does next to nothing to help alleviate the problem. Plus it makes you tired on top of it. It really only has 2 things to offer. One its cheap. and two it helps you get to sleep. Unless you are using it as a sleep aid for night allergies you really should try either chlorpheniramine maleate tablets, loratidine, or cetirizine hydrochloride tablets. On second thought benadryl really isnt worth taking for mild night allergies either. Instead take nyquil. It has doxylamine succinate which will help your allerigies just as well if not better and put you to sleep better for sure. not only that but it has acetaminophen which will alleviate any pain associated with your nose or sinuses due to the allergy."
3,Works well for small room,"I am giving this three stars because I thought that it was more powerful than it really is. If you have a small room then this is perfect. It is very quiet and works immediately. However, it doesn't filter the size of room that is advertised.This product works well up to about 250sq feet. Then it is just not strong enough. That said, if you are looking for a purifier for a smaller room than this thing is perfect!"
3,Just like any other canned soup,I thought this would be really good soup since it's made by Wolfgang Puck but it taste like any other canned soup. Its o.k. but not great
2,"Enough Room, Falls Apart","I bought this bag when my daughter was born. My husband and I used this daiper bag for the first three months or so, and then the inside liner started to tear apart. We bought another diaper bag to replace this one, but found that it was to small. So we resorted to using this one again, although it was all torn up inside. So we liked becuase of all the room inside, but didn't like it becuase the liner tore. We were always trying to search for the little items that disappeared behind the torn liner. It also didn't have many pockets for organizing anything."
2,Lasted 8 months,"Considering the price, this bag wasnt so bad. It was light and roomy and only after 8 months of abuse did the zipper break."
2,Cheaply Made,I picked this bag out because I love Pooh and thought it was such a cute diaper bag. It's cute until about 6 months of being carried and the zipper breaks and the lining is falling apart inside. It seems to be very cheaply made. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money and buy a Graco bag. I have had mine for 7 months now (since the Pooh bag fell apart) and it still looks brand new.
2,does not hold up well,I bought this bag because it was cute and it matched my stroller/car seat perfectly and it is big. But I was very disappointed because the lining tore very easily and everything would fall through.
2,Not worth it,"I was very disappointed in this bag. I bought it because it was big and I liked the color and I love Pooh, but the bag started to fall apart after about 4 months. I would have to say, pass it by, and get a Greco, it's smaller but sturdier!"
1,Yet another zipper break,"I read the reviews before I bought this diaper bag but the bag was so cute, I bought it anyway. I should have listened to the people who said their zipper broke. My daughter just turned two months and the zipper just broke! I have barely used the diaper bag. Cute as it may be, fight the urge and pass it up."
2,"Cute and big, but flimsy","The bag is big and light and we loved it until it started falling apart after about 6 months. Now, all the lining has pulled out and we have to buy a new bag."
4,After an illness - I found this book a comfort.,"After experiencing panic attacks - I needed to read books that would give me emotional strength. This book brought laughter, tears and hope to my soul. I would recommend this book to anyone who is going through a difficult time in their life and needs to be uplifted."
1,Receipt of product,"I have never receieved this book in the mail,have been waiting for delivery but it never came.If you do not intend to send this book I want my money back.Thank you,Rita Begle"
2,clicking sound,"The mouse makes a loud clicking sound every time I right or left mouse click. the Kensington pocket mouse is very quiet, but not so with this larger version. I find it distracting and somewhat annoying. I wish there was a way to ""silence"" the mouse so I don't have to listen to the loud click every time I press down on the mouse button."
4,"Good for PC, Bad for MAC","This mouse works great on my PC, but when I plugged it into my MAC, for some reason, it had a mind of it's own and refused to work correctly after a few minutes. Overall, it's a good inexpensive mouse and I would buy it again."
4,Works fine with Mac,Disappointed with the frequent pairing issues with the Logitech wireless mouse I bought for my iMac so went to this simple corded product. Simply plug and play. Always works. No problems. Don't know about durability as only had for a month.
2,Very Poor Motion Sensor; NOT recommended,"This is not a good product. It's cursor control is spotty at best. For instance, you can be moving the cursor to the right of the screen and suddenly it jerks to the left. Avoid this one at all costs. It is NOT worth its reasonable price."
2,Cheap Junk,This is garbage. Bought it because my last one broke. It sits in the closet alone and feeling shameful for its cheap construction and crappy performance. Boo Kensington. BOO.
5,Kensington mouse,"I use this for Autocad on a MacBook Pro and need a good mouse. This one works better than the several wireless mice that I tried previously. Much more precise and doesn't have spells of erratic behavior as I was experiencing before. My hand doesn't get as sore and tired. The wire is the only drawback when traveling, but it is light and flexible. Recommend this mouse."
3,Would NOT recommend for Mac users,"The mouse is comfy, works with my Macbook just fine, good long cord. However, it does not have side scroll. I read through the reviews and saw other people liked it for mac and I did note the vertical scroll feature but I when I purchased it I completely forgot that the mac mice have rollerball scroll in every direction. I didn't realize how important horizontal was for scrolling quickly around magnified photos which I do a lot.I'll keep it but if it dies I'm going back to a Mac mouse or paying more attention to that product feature. Good enough for the price, just less convenient then the proprietary equipment would have been."
2,"Maybe it's just me, but this thing is junk.","I have monitors set to a maximum resolution. Unfortunately, this mouse isn't nearly precise enough to use with it. It doesn't move consistently or accurately. It is not very ergonomic. However, it is cheap and it's slightly better than the stock HP mouse that my local IT gave me."
4,Good and simple,"For years, I used the mouse that came with my iMac. It worked fairly well, but the little ball would lock up occasionally--sometimes in the middle of a game, causing me to make move that I did not intend...or I would need to scroll down a page and it would not scroll back up. After one too many times, I just simply decided to get a new one. The Apple mice are too expensive, but I was wary of trying a cheaper one. Purchased this one after reading the good reviews and I am very satisfied. It performs most of the functions of the Apple mouse, including push down on the wheel to bring up the Dashboard, and it also offers the convenience of right-clicking--with Apple mice you have to press command then click, a two-step process. The one function it does not have is the squeeze to switch between open windows, but that can be accomplished by using the designated button on the Apple keyboard (F3). All in all, a very good product; I'm glad I chose it."
5,Mouse for Mac,"Replaced Apple mouse for Mac (which got dirty and was impossible to get inside to clean) with this basic, comfortable mouse. Works fine, great value, love it!"
5,Upgrade from magic mouse,"Sturdy, reasonably comfortable, decent price. I miss the magic mouse's ability to scroll sideways - especially when working with my photos - but I don't miss MM's tendency to gum up and not work with a Tinker's damn. It works well & it's inexpensive. Can't ask for much more."
5,Great mouse for PC or Mac,"Plug it in and go! No drivers to download, no hassles. Nice long cord which makes it easy to sit farther away from the screen and reduce eyestrain. I love it. The price is right, it works immediately and does the job perfectly. I'm not a video game player so I don't know if this mouse has what game players want, but for everyday computer uses -- checking/sending email, reading the news online, surfing the Net or shopping -- it's perfect."
5,A Great Book,"This is a really great book 4 ages 13-15. I loved it so much I read it in 3 days! So the next day I bought the next book "" Girls Under Pressure"" which I also read in 3 days. They are both awesome books and I really enjoyed them. If you relly liked this book you should read "" Angus, Thongs, and Full-Frontal- Snogging"" It is a really good book too."
5,FAB!,Girls In Love is fab.Great for teenagers who think their fat and ugly.It's about a girl Ellie who has 2 best mates Magda and Nadine.Ellie thinks she's really fat and ugly.When she goes on holiday she saw a boy called Dan who's really sad but in the end thinks start to get better!
2,Definitely not as good as the first three,"I was really disappointed in this book. I had read the first three in the series and thought they were pretty good, but this one was awful. Ellie's boyfriend is a creep who steals her ideas, monopolizes her time, makes fun of her friends, and tries to take advantage of her and yet she still stays with him? What kind of message is this book sending to young girls- that it is okay to let your boyfriends control you if you really love them? I do NOT recommend this book!"
5,Girls in Love by Jaqueline Wilson,"Ellie,Nadine and Madga are all best friends.Ellie is chubby and funny. Nadine is pretty and sensible and Magda is glamorous and sexy. They are a funny trio and when Nadine and Magda have both got boyfriends Ellie gets jealous.She lies about having a boyfriend and gets in a muddle.Magdas boyfriend turns out to be selfish and immature and Nadines boyfriend turns out to be a bad boy. This book can be funny, crazy and sad all at the same time and will cheer you up if you're feeling down Age group- 10-15yrs"
4,Great!,"This book is one of my favourites!It is very realistic, and describes being a teenager perfectly. Comedy, and sadness make up this well balanced book, and I would recommend it to anyone over the age of 11-12. I also loved the sequel, ""Girls Under Pressure"", and unlike that book, this one seemed to grow slightly flat after a lot of reading."
2,Poor Case Construction,The plastic case is very poor construction. The heavy socket set needs a heavy case to carry it. This case has already broken and will continue to break until I will not be able to use it.
1,Not for Gaming Players,"Stay away from this router if you are planning to use the firewall capabilities and you play on-line games. They have a feature within their firewall that is not configurable, and it flags multiple incoming UDP packets as being a ""flood"", and starts dropping them, EVEN IF YOU HAVE OPENED THE PORTS WITH THE VIRTUAL SERVER SETUP !!Yes, I am yelling, because this is a simple fix that Belkin seems to refuse to correct. This is most likely the reason for Tom's problem with VOIP.So until Belkin corrects this, I would stay away from this product."
2,System installer has to speak up.,"I have to tell you that I have configured 5 of these in the last 2 months. One was dead on arrival, one had very weak signal strength, and a third had compatibility issues with it's own pre-N NIC security settings. In my opinion, this system is much on hype, but little on delivery. It carries all the flaws that have follwed Belkin's G series routers, like only the default network address will work with DHCP, and brings some new ones into play. It sure sounds like a good product if you haven't seen any work though. More information can be found at http://www.advotechllc.com/Tips/WirelessSecurity.htm"
1,"Constantly drops connection, needs reboots, poor tech support","I bought this with the matching pre-n card and it's been so frustrating. Wireless connection almost completely useless since it constantly drops the connection. My wired connection sometimes stops working and then I have to reboot the router. I've been checking tech support for a firmware upgrade/repair and nothing to be found. Reading the reviews, many people have been having these problems. I guess Belkin just feels a new sucker is born every minute. Well, this sucker is not buying anything from this company if I can help it. Another reviewer spoke well of the new Netgear Rangemax router. I'll probably buy one of those to see if it's better."
2,not p2p friendly,"When a p2p software such as Bitcomet is running, the router becomes irresposive to other applications that require internet access such as IE or Firefox. From what I found on the net, this is due to the limited TCP/IP connections allowed by the router."
1,BUYER BEWARE! NOT COMPATIBLE WITH XBOX LIVE!,"As a previous review said, while gaming this router drops packets like a mad dog, even if you place the game system in the DMZ!I have the original version of this router, Version 1001, and it does not do this, so I am using that version now, but the version they have been producing in 2005, Version 2000, is rotten...It all comes down to firmware, both versions run different firmware, and from what I've heard Belkin's hardware and firmware teams have a hard time communicating, and it shows!The original router had an issue connecting with PSP which took months after the release of PSP to be combated with a firmware update, now with this problem it appears that it may never be taken care of... Stay away from this product if you are a gamer..."
1,Not a full function router!,"The Belkin Pre-N router turned out to be fast, but incapable.I run a web site and an FTP site inside my LAN, and must access them locally for maintenance. This is not possible (in a very practical sense) with the Belkin router! In a way it can partly be done by using the local ip address, but it is very labor-intensive, inconvenient and can't be totally successfully done...The previous Netgear router did this maintenance fine, but alas, it locked up or froze frequently.So it's off to find another router that neither locks up nor prevents me from doing maintenance.The most galling part of this experience is the attitude from Belkin: ""none of our routers does loopback"". ""You must go outside your network to do maintenance"".If they had been upfront about this, it would have saved me many hours, many dollars and many telephone calls to India.Well, now you know -"
1,Worst Customer Service and Some Product issue,"This product has some known issue after firmware upgrade fix. Router hangs sometimes, Connection gets dropped and not able to forward port in their virtual server area. Also, I do not see any way to open or close port other than port forwarding in their firewall section.HORRIBLE..HORRIBLE Customer service. I sent two email for their port forwarding issue and none of them were replied. I did get auto reply (off course it is automated reply so they do not have to spend money) but did not get any reply from thier customer service. I never had situation so far that some company did not reply at all. I am writing this review after waiting for 1 week for my reply since they auto reply says they will get back to us in 72 hours. Also, I saw so many bad review on belkin as a company customer service on net.Bottom line is stay away from BELKIN products."
2,Problematic,"This router gave us trouble from the start. We're a small office with generally 3-5 networked computers (some Mac, some Windoze) running at a time on a business-class cable connection. We ran this router for four months, then removed it from service. The throughput was fair, but certainly not what we expected given the reviews. The most significant issue was that it dropped packets like crazy, and outages were frequent. It was not uncommon that our wireless network was down 30% of any given day, even while our wired connections were running fine."
3,Don't buy it if you have a broadband phone!,The router is good. The range is excellent. I had big issues with Broadvoice phone service. Chopped calls even when I put the sipura ATA on DMZ. Finally is working with the ATA on DMZ and some other tweeks I found on google. Stay away if you intend to use with VOIP.
1,Crummy Router,"I bought this thing because I needed more power than my old D-Link wireless router could give.First, I couldn't get the unit to connect properly despite over an hour with the Belkin service people on the phone. They gave up and said that they didn't know how to fix it.Second, I measured the wireless signal that it put out and it had less range than the D-Link that I already have!Maybe its just a bad unit, maybe not."
2,Very Disappointed,I thought I was going to love this router and all my computers would share a faster single. Well it didn't work out like that I had to reinstall it 3 times on my main coputer and it still didn't work and to make matters worst after i added and rebooted the third time my hard drive crashed now I have to send off for a restore disc. My laptop can still get the signal but the router stops sending basically when it wants to so I lose my connection in the middle of work and can't get it back up for sometimes hours. My other belkin routers work like a dream and this is a nightmare. I've lost everything off my other comp and this one I'm afraid is not far behind. I don't know if I'll ever buy another belkin product.
3,it says 250000 feet,The machine doesnt have long distance. I go little far away from the machine and my connection speed drops down. I didnt like it..
2,lack of functionality could be a problem in some cases,"I have just installed this router for use in a large (about 300x200 ft) apartment, for guest use (using their own laptops). This means that it is not feasible to get the corresponding client cards and while the coverage without these is OK it still does not cover a the whole apartment. This would not be a probem but you cannot install a repeater or use WDS with this router. I am now stuck with a router that does not cover a large enough distance and cannot extend the network to cover the whole apartment. I think that this information should be much more readily available before buying this product."
2,Wireless Router,Very pleased with product. I have 5 computers in my house networked through this router and the computers can be anywhere inside the house or in any part of our 2 acre lot and still receive an excellent signal. Highly recommend for a large home or office.
3,"No VPN, Intermittant performance, not quite there","Purchased to replace my Linksys rounter as I needed a little more range within my house. Without a doubt, it does provide a wider range - sometimes. As stated in other reviews, it frequently cycles between a very strong signal to dropping out. The bigger issue is that despite what is stated it it's specs, it does not support most VPNs. This was verified by a Fortune 100 company's IT group. Had to ask them to verify this, as Belkin's tech support is a joke.It's too bad they couldn't get it just right - when the signal is strong, it is faster and farther reaching than any B or G product I've used."
1,watta pain,"just bought this router based on good reviews I read here. Don't believe everything you read. Have had nothing but trouble. First, I did not get any boost in performance. Placed Belkin F5D8230-4 in same location as my old Netgear router and I still have problems using a wireless notebok located 50 feet away. Was expecting 54Mbps but getting between 24 and 36 Mbps... About the same as Netgear. So much for extending the range and boosting performance. Also, have lost capabilities-- my online stock brokerage software no longer works because it requires port 443 which belkin blocks. Tried configuring router to allow port 443 but no matter what I tried, it don't work. How about that Belkin tech support??? Tried them but was placed on hold for extended periods of time - after 15 minutes- gave up."
5,Home networking must,"I bought this wireless router 3 months ago. I live in a 3 story town home in a densly popluated neighborhood. I get many strong network singals from neighbor's wireless networks and wanted a secure, reliable solution for a reasonable cost. I found the solution in the Belkin Pre-N Router. I have an Intel a/b/g integrated wireless in my personal laptop and a CiscoSystems PCMCIA a/b/g card in my work laptop. Both maintain solid connections and were easy to set up. I am very impressed with the wireless security and firewall. The router has been easy to set up and manage, no intrusions, great signal strength, range and speed."
2,No Improvement,"The Wall Street Journal's Mossberg highly recommended this device as a way to improve the range and strength of an 801.11G wireless network.I replaced a Linksys G wireless router with this device and I can see no difference whatsoever.Not that it's bad ... it's not. It works just as well as the router I replaced, but that's not what I expected. There are just as many dead spots in the house and the strength in each of the rooms is no better."
1,Horrible for Mac Airport 11.b networks,"After a week of fighting with this router, I am going back to Linksys. I have a Macintosh network with 11.b Airport cards in both desktop and laptop G4s. After restarting the computer, everything works great UNTIL the computer goes to sleep. Waking from sleep, the Airport absolutely cannot find the Belkin network until after a complete reboot. Interestingly enough, the computer never has any problem finding my neighbor's wireless Linksys network! I called tech support, and talked with someone named Adrian who knew far less than me about the system I am using. After he could not suggest anything else than things I had already tried, he just hung up on me. Thanks, Belkin--never again. Sticking with Linksys."
2,"Fast, but unreliable","I bought this router about 4-5 months ago and was happy with the speed boost over my previous router (Belkin, wireless g). But, the thing keeps dropping the connection every few days. I have to restart the router, or pull the plug for a few minutes. Belkin tech support is very unresponsive. I wouldn't buy another Belkin, but I'm stuck with this one for now."
1,Poor customer service,"I just replaced my wrt54g with this router. On the wrt54g I was getting about 6meg/sec download speed. With this router, on my desktop I'm getting 7.5meg/sec. However, on my laptop I'm getting 300kb/sec. Obviously there's a problem.I called technical support. It's the kind of tech support where the ""tech"" asks you a question and then they put you on hold for a minute while they look through their flowchart for the next question to ask you. Every question was the obvious problems that I already checked on my own. After about five questions he says the problem is my internet connection. I explain to him that I'm getting 7.5meg on my desktop, so it can't be the connection. And then I got the usual ""may I help you with anything else today?"" I might as well have been dealing with an automated system.I'll be packing up the Pre-N and sending it back in the morning. Too bad."
4,It works!,"Belkin builds a very good product and it works very well, but amazons lack of info about the age of product was a bit of a shock. Thought I was buying a new router but it is a 2001 model with a verizon sticker."
1,out of the box and didnt connect to the internet,"I've spent over two hours tweaking this, and over an hour on the phone with customer support. The thing still wont connect to the internet. Don't get me wrong, the lights light up and my laptop can connect to the ROUTER, but the router wont connect to the internet.Belkin tech support told me to send it back. I will and I think I will try the Dlink Pre N."
5,Top Quality,"I installed this router after remodeling a bedroom into an office.Without access to the wall to run cable, I needed to use a wireles set upto get on line. Set up was very easy. The instructions were simple andcomplete. I was up and running in less than a half hour. The speed isoutstanding and pages download as fast as my hardwire cable used to load.I liked the fact that Belkin offers a lifetime warranty. There competitiondoes not. That tells me that they are sure of their product and will standbehind it.I'd buy Belkin again."
3,A deficient firewall and firmware,This router makes it impossible to have meaningful conversations with voice messaging. Mangles voice etc. You have to disable firewall so voice works. No firmware has been issued to fix it.
1,Horrible reliability - fails to work,"http://www.dslreports.com/forum/remark,13541132~days=9999~start=180<a href='http://www.dslreports.com/forum/remark,13541132~days=9999~start=180'>Go</a>This thing if under any load, drops all ability to communicate on port 80. Only recourse is to reset the router. This is a known problem and Belkin refuses to fix."
1,Not worth a much,"I bought this item about a year ago to replace the old wireless G router I had (slow slow slow!). There weren't too many N routers out yet but I wanted something that wouldn't be totally obsolete and would provide a better signal. The Belkin's range is decent, but the quality is only okay.Most importantly is the frequency of WIRELESS CRASHES. This think would drop out a couple times a week and I would need to power cycle it to get wireless back up, but the last few months saw an escalation. First it was every night, then twice a day, recently I couldn't use the damn thing for more than a half hour without it taking a dump.This is an unreliable POS. As many have noted before me about crashes, they are a serious flaw. Skip this product."
2,I liked it until . . .,"This router performed well, pushing our wireless reach to corners of the house our Internet signal could not otherwise reach. However, after about a year of good service, things began to go awry. First the wired side of the router became erratic, then failed completely, a tragedy for the wired connections that included our network attached storage backup device and a laser printer. Then the wireless side started behaving erratically.We've ordered the ""final"" Belkin N product, and are living on an ancient D-Link G wireless access pointand an even older Netgear wired router. Ah well, the vicissituedes of solid state technology when it goes less than solid . . ."
5,Much better range with even just a G card,"I had been using a NetGear WGR614 G wireless router for a couple of years with a NetGear wireless G card. Worked reliably, but slowly when my laptop was some 15 feet from the router and in the basement (router on ground floor). Transmission was slow and signal strenth ran ""very weak"".Bought this Belkin router from Amazon for $71, removed the Netgear router and put the Belkin in its place. Plugged all the cables in, cycled power on the cable modem (Charter/Motorola) and my PC and I was up and running. No reading any instructions or running any install disk. Simple as can be. In the basement, the signal strength with the Netgear G card is now ""good"" with speed at 54 Mbps. Things are notably faster.Will get a Belkin MIMO PCMCIA card tomorrow and that should make things even better.Bottom line is for $110 (router/card) total I will have pre-N level speed and range on my one laptop and improved range and speed on my other two laptops that will stay as G's.Sweet."
2,"Good range, but dropped packets","This Belkin router was easy to install and it had a good wireless range, but it dropped a lot of packets and continued to get worse over time. I could not use Skype or any VoIP with it, and ultimately returned it as it began dropping too many packets to even support Internet Explorer."
1,Once again utter failure--,"I have already thrown my first Belkin Router away. Believe or not this one started out great with easy setup and throughput increased from 700Kbps to about 2.6MB using Speedtest as my measure. This lasted about 4 weeks. Then utter disaster, lost connections every 10 minutes. The product just failed miserably. How aggravating to keep pumpting money into what I thought would finally be a stable wireless solution only to have it fail after 4 weeks of operation. I am using the Belking pre-n card in a normal xp configuration. I ended up running ethernet cable back over the link simply to attain stability. What a pain--stupid wires running across the property because of the utter failure of the wireless companies to get stability in their offering. Reading the other reviews apparently I am not the only one with this experience."
2,not reliable. at all.,I will have to return this router... I thought it was a bargain but it's just too unreliable! The throughput is terrible and the firewall is a miserable excuse for one. Configuration options are poor and limited. Spend the money and buy a decent router. The tech support is supremely poor. Belkin barely supports this router. Period.
3,It's OK --- Just don't use it as a WAP only!,"Works fine as a router, but when I tried to use it as a WAP only it lost it's internet settings --- EVERY TIME! And forget about Belkin tech support. They are useless. But for a home environment, where you are using it as a router, with NAT, it's totally fine. Gives good coverage. Don't worry about the Pre-N standard and the fear tactics that say it hasn't been standardized. Who cares? It works, so, well, it works."
3,Choppy VOIP,"Super range, but after installing this router, my Vonage started getting ""choppy."" Removing this router, and the problem goes away. A call to Belkin Technical Support finds out that they know about the problem and that they have no resolution (other than using one of their ""G"" routers. So if your a VOIP user, stay away!"
4,"Fast, easy setup and great signal.","I bought this router because I have 3 TiVos in my condo that are all on my wireless network. Their signal was pretty weak from across the condo and it made for slow transfers and some faulty connection attemtps. When I put in the Belkin router all the signals boosted significantly, and I really like the web-based setup. It has lots of advanced controls (I needed port forwarding and MAC address filtering) but comes with logical defaults for those who are afraid to configure it themselves. I'm not even using Pre-N network cards to experience the full benefit of the router, but so far it's been great!"
2,"sometimes fast, sometimes slow","My unit only achieved the promised speeds on channel 1; channel 6 and 11 were horrible even though I don't have any neighbors with WiFi. The other problem I had was with my Centrino laptop, which had bad performance most of the time with this router."
2,Disappointed and Worst Technique Support (Long Waiting Time),"1. I bought the belkin pre-n router based on the rating report, and I've tried to fix one month day and night. Internet is still not stable and everyday I need to reset the router in order to access online. In the beginning, technique support asks to exchange the new router, update firmware, change setting. Computer is still not stable. After trying one month, I give up the belkin pre-n router b/c I found out someone is also like to buy this router based on the rating and also feel very disappointed. And I change other router which is linksys WRT54GS. After I've changed to Linksys WRT54GS, all of the problems is solved2. Everytime I called belkin technique support and the waiting time is ""ALWAYS"" over 30 mins no matter weekday, weekend, day and night.3. Belkin Pre-N does have the good signal and good rang but it's not very stable. Too Disappointed...."
4,"Great W-lan capabilities, but a little disappointing concernig further options","As the title says, the W-lan capabilities of this Router are great.Even 2 floors above the router (solid ferroconcrete) I have still ~60% signal quality and high transfer rates.On the other hand I expected more settings for that price.-I missed the possibility to associate IP's with fix mac addresses-My internet Provider uses an MTU that is outside of the ajustible values (Arcor Germany with 1488 and 1492)-The setup Tool that came on a CD doesn't allow to configure the Router when the WAN port is not connected to the internet(of course you can if you use the html configuration)At the moment I'm using the Belkin as an Access Point and my old rooter keeps the connection to the Internet and works as a DHCP server"
1,Belkin sucks,"This product worked great at first, but the router is totally unreliable. The router will hang & become totally unresponsive. Only solution is a HARD reset. Technical support is unresponsive, next step is SMALL CLAIMS COURT."
3,This is NOT an 802.1X device,"This is an 802.11b/g/n device.802.1X (often mistakenly called 802.11x) is an authentication protocol, and this router does NOT support RADIUS authentication, for those of you who googled for 802.11x and got this page."
3,Kinda cute,"The story was somewhat interesting. But, the plot lacked a deeper exploration of one of the characters, the one played by Emily Mortimer. The only thing we know about her is that she is an single English journalist living in Russia. David Arquette seemed lost as to what to do with his character. Nelson was pretty good and the chemistry between Nelson and Mortimer was interesting.Slow at first, the movie picked up its pace when the brothers, Josh and Jake, arrived in Russia. But, this is where the plot seemed to get a bit lost. With a inconclusive and unsatisfying resolution, the movie failed to keep me interested in Josh all that much, and failed to make me understand a bit more about Jake."
4,Really cute movie!!,"This is a movie about what people need vs want. Three people with different needs and how to accomplish getting them, but very different wants. Great acting and storyline."
3,Go with M570 or a different one,"IR base is big and cludgy, would be OK for a desktop, definitely a detriment for a laptop. Quit working in less than a year even with new batteries. Mouse started intermittently loosing connection to the base for long periods of time. Not one of Logitech's best products. Go with the M570 or similar much easier to use and so far much more solid operationally."
2,Spokes break,"With very few miles on them, 3 Spokes broke. When one breaks, The whole wheel goes out of whack right away! I didn't have the tools to loosen the brakes, So I had to carry my bike home. One spoke broke when I let the air out. Now I'm scared to ride very far from home. I would need tools, pump, And extra spokes, To fix it."
3,Attractive but hard to read,"This is a very nice looking piece of jewelry, and feels solid, but unfortunately the watch face is difficult to read in normal indoor lighting. The arms are a subtle gold and the face is an opalescent white, which combine to make the time difficult to read without close inspection. One has to look carefully for several ticks to determine which hand is the hour and which is the second hand.It would be very nice if you want an attractive item to wear in a dressy situation and you don't really need to consult the watch very often - if you just want to make sure you have a watch, but you are not using it to tell time hourly throughout the day to make sure you are at meetings or on time for a call."
2,be careful,My husband bought this watch for me for my birthday i love it it is a very atractive watch three months after i got it it acquired some moisture on the inside and the face started to fog up and now its not keeping time. Its a real shame because i really like the watch and it says its water proof.
2,"They May be legends, but Ball and G's new cd isnt legendary","Before Outkast, Before The Geto Boys, Before Arrested Development, there was 8 Ball & M.J.G...the souths premire rappers and some of the greatest southern Mc's to ever grace the world of Hip Hop music. And while Ball and G may be legends thier new cd is anything but legendary, and there is one reason for that...Bad Boy Records. Bad Boy and Ball and G are so different from each other that when combining MJG's southern drawl and 8 Ball's Graspy Hardcore rhyming with Crunk beats it fails miserabaly and leaves with dissapointment:1.Album Intro-N/A2.You Don't Want Drama-B+(2nd Best Song On CD)3.Straight Cadillac Pimpin-B4.We Do It-C5.The Streets-C+6.Mad Rapper-N/A7.Shot Off-F8.When It's On-C9.Trying To Get At You-C+10.Baby Girl-C+11.Get A Kit-N/A12.Forever-B+(3rd Best Song On CD)13.Look At The Grillz-C+14.Living Legends-N/A15.Don't Make-B-16.Memphis City Blues-B-17.Gangsta-B+18.Confessions-A-(Best Song On CD)"
3,Living Legends,"I did not order this one through Amazon but it is 8 Ball & MJG so, I need to let you know my thoughts. As a die hard 8 Ball & MJG fan, I must say that their past few cd's, prior to this one, were not all that hott but this one is better. I know, they teamed up with P. Diddy on this one so, it's got some good tracks on it. Still commercial but it's better thatn the past few. Anyway, I would suggest it for your collection but it's nothing to really write home about. YMMV. NEOSOUL06"
5,Simply Amazing!,"I learned about this cd from listening to Yahoo! Music one day and the song was great. They are under rated and add well to the ""Dirty South"" generation. There sound is a mix of Lil jon and greatness."
4,Dirty South is where is at,I like this CD. the dirty south is making its spot in the scene of hip hop. its not all about west coast and New york anymore. the beats get you bouncing and just get you going. P.Diddy did the right thing signing these cats to his Label.
4,A comment to those who review.,"This editorial is in response to those who have decided to post their thoughts on Amazon's website regarding their review of 8Ball and MJG's most recent album. I have been a fan of the group since their days with Suave House and am glad to see them brought back from animosity by Bad Boy's new southern venture. What bothers me about the reviews I have seen on this website is that ""so called fans"" of the group write the most grammatically incorrect sentences, thoughts and phrases I have ever seen. If you plan on rating an album, especially under the guise of supporting a group who is reemerging into the spotlight, give them the proper respect by phrasing your critique in a grammatically correct manner. Otherwise you run the risk of the country not taking you seriously, and dismissing what might be an informative review, after the first sentence. Thank you."
1,Awful,"This sucks, the last thing we need nowadays are more fat guys jumping around saying ""dont..want..drama"" with no rhyming talent and legions of brainless ""rap"" fans. Anyone who calls them self a rap fan and owns this can go home becuase this sucks. They disgrace the likes of Outkast by calling it ""southern rap""."
4,Eightball & MJG Living Legends,"When I first heard that Eightball and MJG signed to Bad Boy's new Bad Boy South Records, I was pretty pissed off because I figured that P Diddy's production was gonna be all over the album. But I was wrong. Even though they signed with Bad Boy Records they put together a very solid album. Everybody has heard the new single ""You Dont Want Drama"" which is the best song out now in my opinion. Other strong songs on the album are The Streets feat Bun-B, Shot Off feat Ludacris, Look At The Grillz feat TI and Twista, and Gangsta. The entire album is good. There isn't a bad song on the whole album. If you are an 8ball & MJG fan this is a must have. Dont sleep on this album, these boys from memphis always put it down so go and pick up this album along with their other albums."
3,could have been better,ball and mjg are good lyricists lovede them since the first cd but what was they thinking by signing with puffy and bad boy this cd is good but without puff's involvement could have been better screw you puffy or whatever you go by now you just jocking the south cause they're hot right now.
5,Real Memphis,This album is off da hook! U need 2 get this. The best southern rap album since...EVER! P.Diddy has out done himself! Well with the exception of Big Poppa R.I.P.! But u need 2 get this fo reel!
2,I DIDN'T SEEM TO REALLY BE IMPRESSED WITH THIS ALBUM,"I'M A BIG 8BALL & MJG FAN. BUT THIS ALBUM DIDN'T REALLY IMPRESS ME THAT MUCH. THE ONLY SONGS THAT I REALLY LIKED WERE ''YOU DON'T WANT DRAMA'', ''FOREVER'', ''MEMPHIS CITY BLUES'', AND ''TRYING TO GET AT YOU''. THE REST OF THE ALBUM IS MEDIOCRE. I REALLY THINK THESE GUYS SHOULDN'VE WENT TO BAD BOY. CAUSE AFTER ALL, THESE GUYS DON'T FIT IN AT BAD BOY! THEY SHOULD'VE STAYED WITH SUAVE HOUSE. HIP HOP SEEMS TO BE HAVING ANOTHER MEDIOCRE YEAR. RAP HAS BEEN TOTALLY F***ED UP SINCE 2002, AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE GETTING ANY BETTER."
4,Special indeed,"You would think that after publishing ""Hurricane at War"" people at Ian Allen would leave this plane for a year or so, but the Special came more or less right after it. After all those years there is still material that can only be found in this book, like the upward-firing rockets launched by Hurricanes, the pick-a-back Hurricane, the all-wood Hurricanes that only costed 50 plus all their dummy bases, and so on. You can do worse than buying this book when you are interested in the Hawker Hurricane, your only problem will be where to buy it."
3,The Son's of Cush,"Prehistoric nations labels the sons of Cush as caucasian (""White men"") on pages 57-58. This is untrue and unreliable. I think John D. Baldwin has proven that the sons of Cush are the originators of civilization, but he has also proven that he may be indoctrinated in the Aryan Myth."
1,Not even in the same league as Kung Fu Hustle. . .,"I'm glad this movie is in the "" comedy "" section otherwise I'd not known it was a comedy. I laughed one time. To say this is in anyway as clever or funny as Kung Fu Hustle is like comparing Rosie O'Donnel to Cindy Crawford. I think you get my point.I think you could take one of those 18 fingers of death and poke your own eye out. That would be slightly more enjoyable then having to watch this movie.I got to see this movie for free yet I somehow feel I should in some way get my money back. It's the oddest feeling. Kinda goes with the bitter taste left in my mouth after having watched this movie."
1,WORST MOVIE EVER!,"I love the stupid goofy movies like Baseketball, Kung Pow, and Dodgeball, but this movie is just stupid. I hope everyone involved in the making of this film was fired...out of a cannon...into a wall."
1,horrible,"this is the worst movie ever. I thought ""The Muskateer"" was the worst..then I rented this. Based on the comparison of Spinal Tap and Kung Fu Hustle found in the review of this movie on the box, I rented it. Whoever reviewed it to be such lost all credability with me for sure. Some of the worst acting I have ever seen. The humor couldnt make a 2nd grader laugh. And this isnt a good ""bad"" movie either. I love those, and this isnt it."
1,Youch,"I waited 1.5 minutes before pulling the ejection lever, and I will lick the wounds to my bloody demise"
1,Another sorry movie for Lorenzo Lamas to star in!,"Whomever Lorenzo Lamas' agent is (does he have one?) should be shot.He has made flop after flop and this is no exception.His acting is horrible...Have you seen 30,000 leagues under the sea?That's a gem."
1,"Wooo, This sucked","I would have to give this movie my middle finger out of my five fingers. Stay away from this flick, comparing this to Kung Fu Hustle. Come on, this guy comparing should be shot. Kung Fu Hustle was a funny movie, this was just like the poo in my son's diaper."
3,factory second?,"This is a stunning watch, very classy, and fits great. Not too bulky but gets attention. The watch seems to function properly but I thought I would let everyone know that there are two tick marks (18,19s) that are missing on mine. This is almost unnoticeable, but even for the great deal I got through amazon, it was a lot to spend for what seems to be a factory second. What seems too good to be true usually is..."
5,perfect watch!,This watch was the perfect gift for my boyfriend. The size of the watch face is substantial and the diamond bezel is classy without being overdone.
4,nice watch,"Nice watch. Classy with a little flash, but not so much that it screams look at me.Great price, too. I paid $319.00 and see it everywhere else for $650.00 retail and $499.00 on sale.I dig it."
4,"Soothing, relaxing c.d. by great violinist",I have David Klinkenbergs Christmas c.d and love it! That's why I purchased this one. Not as awesome as his Christmas one but still a very moving c.d. would definatley recommend it!
4,one song missing,"I loved the sound track, but I really loved the one song missing.""When Did Your Heart Go Missing?"" by Rooney"
3,It was okay.,"Liked the movie so much I decided to by the soundtrack. It was okay for a soundtrack. I liked some of the music, but not all of it. I think if you liked all the music in the movie then you would be happy with this soundtrack."
1,Dissapointed,"I really enjoyed the Nancy Drew movie, and really thought some of the music in the movie was great, so I went online to see if there was a soundtrack.I was very happy to see that there was one, but just like tons of soundtracks they kill one of the best songs ""When Did Your Heart Go Missing?"" by RooneyBeing a HUGE 80's fan I really enjoyed The Donna's cover of Kim Wilde- Kids in America, and the strange, somber cover of New Order- Blue Monday by Flunk, but because ""When Did Your Heart Go Missing?"" by Rooney was not included on the soundtrack,it just wasn't worth it to buy the soundtrack for me.I will not buy the CD now as I originally planned.Very dissapointing. Message to Bulletproof Records, dumb move oimitting ""When Did Your Heart Go Missing?"" by Rooney.Good news for me I will just download the tracks I want from Itunes or wherever, it will save me money.Also it was sad to see that Gorillaz- Dare was also omitted, pretty cool song too."
1,Don't waste your money or time,Thought this film would be interesting and exciting. It was not worth the money or time. Boring and at times made no sense and unrealistic mostly.
4,Helpful if you like houseplants and want better air,"Bought the book due to a magazine review. No disappointments even after reading in the magazine much of the information contained in the book. Book has more good information about what type of plants to use in certain areas, ease to grow, how each kind of houseplant helps clean the air in it's space. Good reference for anyone interested in experimenting with improving air quality around them at work or home."
3,okay but not very in depth,"This book covers so much territory so quickly, i didn't find it useful for the amalfi coast. there it only covered a few main walks in main towns instead of getting very deep. the Sunflower Landscape series is much more thorough but doesn't have hotel recommendations."
3,Good Book for the Basics,I bought this book because it has a great colorful cover. The book does host moderate detail about each hiking trail in Italy. I feel that it lacked substance. It also did not have very many color photos to attract you to different hikes available. I give this book a C+.
5,Just fantastic,"What more can you say, its Pyrex. I love this set. I also purchased the storage set and mixing set. Needless to say, all my old plastic junk was put in the trash.The lids are fantastic. They feel like they will hold up forever unlike some others that are rigid and tend to break at the corners or tabs. I never put the lids in the dishwasher, although they are labeled as top rack safe."
1,Box full of broken glass,"This seemed like a great deal and from what I've seen and heard the product is nice as well. Very disappointed. Soon as I picked the box up, I could hear the sound of broken glass. I thought it was extremely odd that Amazon does not put ""fragile"" or ""contains glass"" on the outside of the box.To make the experience worse, 1-2 months for a replacement and even with the return, I won't get money back until after Christmas (purchased around 12/9), which makes it tough to buy a replacement gift in store. I certainly won't be ordering any more glass objects through Amazon's distribution system."
2,"Not the old Pyrex, not made of quality borosilicate glass","Pyrex is no longer made by Corning, and it is no longer made of durable borosilicate glass. The name brand was sold off. Pyrex is made in asia of much cheaper lime silicate glass. I was researching bakeware recently because I wanted the best, and what you want is borosilicate. One brand I found is Marinex, it is made of what Pyrex USED to be made of-- borosilicate glass. This is the highest quality glass you can get for bakeware. Pyrex may not stand up to freezer to oven use. I have also read many accounts of lime silicate glass developing micro cracks you can't see. These then fill with liquid in the oven, and POW, they shatter, injuring people at worst or ruining dinner at best. Buyer beware."
2,"Great Item, Poor Service","The keychain was great. The problem that I have is that it was shipped by Old Glory with a price tag sticker on it. These stickers are hard to get off. I used window cleaner and water to try and get the sticker and the adhesive off of it, but the water seeped into the keychain and wet the paper inside, ruining it. Plus, I still didn't get all of the sticker off. So thanks to the boneheads at Old Glory, I paid $5.00 for something that was ruined before I even received it."
1,Edinochestvo 1 ~ DDT,"Today I received by mail a disk ... and he was very upset CD-R :-((( This drive is not suitable for my collection, because he can write a million of these CD-R.P.S. Now we have to buy from another seller."
2,Candlelight Ecstacy Romance #17-Weak early Jayne Castle,"You can really tell this July 1981 book is a very early Jayne Castle(Krentz) attempt at a romantic story. Rich boss Cord Harding cons employee Savannah Emery, who is on a winning streak at cards, to wager a bet at a party. The stakes are a weekend with him, and she loses. She pretends to accept her fate, but soon escapes from him for her booked vacation a couple hours later. He follows her determined to collect his winnings for three-quarters of the 187 page book. Only when another woman enters the picture does the repetitious book cease to drag and finally move onward with some humour and romance."
1,Hmmmm!,"Not a bad game! Even though, the graphics and everything else looks as if a 3rd grader designed it. I got a better deal than when it first came out, and my son seems to enjoy it (even though he's only 4 yrs.). I was just wondering, how do you collect more of the game cards? Do they come in random booster packs? Is there a special internet site to order them, or is it just the same exact 6 cards in every booster pack? This is what I'm trying to figure out. My son's just looking for specific characters."
2,Cute but not my cup of tea,It was a comedy and the jokes seems too obvious for an American. The situations that were dramatic were unrealistic and would never play out in real life. I won't be renting episode 2.
4,"Great show, DVD has little to no extras","Love the show, but the DVD has little to offer but the show."
2,Poor BBC packaging,"This has nothing to do with the quality of the show, but with BBC's refusal to combine series'. There is no excuse or reason for BBC not combining seasons 1 & 2. These are half hour shows. This is not the first time BBC has done this with their shows. It is inconsiderate and uncalled for and shows the disrespect BBC has for its customers."
3,Definitely not the best . . .,"Frankly speaking, it's not a movie one will want to have on DVD for ever.I have not seen this comedy before, on TV, and it seems as definitely not the best one of its style. The humor is quite lukewarm, though here and there one can hear a sparkle of a good joke, the situation and developments are nearly predictable and almost trivial.The two main heroes leave a sort of unpleasant impression: Tom as a mildly mentally retarded and DIana as a rude bully of extremly nasty personality. It's really difficult to feel real empathy towards them, in fact, the manager of the hostel and his assistant are the ones that seems to be victimized.Even some minor sparks of affection that Tom and Diana show towards each other are quickly extinguished by their sarcasm, egoism and impatience and it's hard to think that these two deserve a better attitude or a better fate.I think, if they had made it a drama, it would stand a chance, but as a comedy?.."
4,Unexpectedly relevant,"I found this book well written, researched and presented. It is an academic work that reads easily and has application and relevance across many platforms including many that are not mentioned (e.g. health care). The examples are clearly presented. Like many books written along these topic lines, the examples are represented in iterative formats to draw out the specific issues. To many readers this may appear repetitive but it does enhance the understanding for those that wish to develop more depth."
1,Far from great,"I read the book years ago and pulled it off my bookshelf recently to skim again. I've read the reviews here as well. I have to say they are surprisingly generous in my opinion.The entire premise put forth by the authors is utterly self-contradicting. In a nutshell, don't plan for what you expect; rather, be prepared to react correctly to the unexpected and worse case scenario. Focus on failure rather than success.""Highly Reliable Organizations"" such as nuclear power plants and military aircraft carriers are cited as the model organizations for business to follow.Don't waste the space on your bookshelf with this one."
4,Add it to your collection,"It's melodic, progressive, and heavy with nice clean vocals. Definitely worth buying....and there's only one."
4,Dutch Progressive Metal,"You might call it the European Alice and Chains. The music is dark, heavy, but melodic. I've not seen another album by them, sadly."
4,Good book from college.,"I was a Theology major in college - this book was required reading material. As a more conservative Christian, I have a lot of respect for Marcus Borg. He is a widely respected theologian, but he also truly believes in Jesus Christ. This book shows how Jesus is viewed as we approach Y2K. Since it is now 2001, I find that Borg to be accurate in his predictions and views. Although other theological book I read in college were ""scholastic"" then Christian, I find Borg has written a refreshing book to which all can relate."
5,Kenny's a star,"Great book and CD! Kenny takes you through the steps in a format that's easy to follow and enjoy. The songs and examples are fun to play and great examples of blues fingerstyle fun. Some fingerstyle playing experience is needed so the newbie to the guitar may struggle to get the timing and changes but for most players this is a great book and CD!Check out Kenny's DVD - I purchased the DVD at the same time and it's got some great tips and tricks. Plus, it's just fun watching a pro work..."
4,The Blues Styles of Kenny Sultan was great.,This is another great book by Kenny Sultan. He gives you some idea's on how to spruce up your blues playing. I am an intermediate player and this book was great. Not too difficult and not too easy. The stuff I am learning really has a good sound to it.
2,Too short stories,"Tylers intentions obviously are good! Get to the juicy scenes after 6 lines of text. For girls on the go.....Well, why not brows through some of the short stories on any of the sex-story sites on the net? Take a print if you need ?!?The stories are typically 2-4 pages. Obviously we jump right into some scene, and then out. would've been OK, BUT without the build-up of erotic tensions, it taks really high quality to make this an erotic read in a complete paperback. And here is the problem. The standard on the juicy stuff is not high enough to lift it above some of the stories at the web sites. Some are better, some worse.Not a total failure, surely there are a lot of people who will love it, but I found it a little too light....."
3,"Interesting, but not all that insightful.","I found this book to be interesting, but not all that insightful. It is written for a beginner or someone who is completely new to the field of board game design. On the other hand, if that is you, you'll find this to be quite helpful."
4,If you are thinking of designing a game...,If you are thinking of designing a game...read this book! Great stories about the history of many hobby game favorites. Insightful interviews with the major players in the industry (although I do wish the interviews were a bit longer). The book is at its best when explaining what NOT to do when designing or publishing your game.
4,Good information,"For someone just getting started in the field this book quickly points out the basics of what to do and not to do. If you are inventing, or plan on inventing, a game get this book and read it all the way through, twice. Then take a nice long think. You'll be better off for it."
4,Real dairy farmimg,"What this video shows is correct and realistic, as we have been to a dairy farm, and my kids have watched it many times. Note that Dairy farming is very much an industry. You'll see rows of cows housed in a sawdust-lined warehouse. Lots of machinery, disinfecting and cleaning, automated manure removal, recycled cow feed, automated milking, a calving. Somewhat random cuts from a cheese factory."
4,Basic book,This is a good basic book on selling your house. It seems to cover all the essential points to consider.
3,Nothing much to say,"The game is fun for a child that enjoys a PS2. There is nothing exciting or special, and it is very easy to learn and play. For a ten year old, this is ideal."
3,This One Has It All,"Preacher is being hunted by Ezra Pease and his hired guns. They are trying to get Preacher out of the way,so that they can start an Indian War. What I like about Preacher is that he is always prepared to do battle; many are surprised who try to ambush him and it is turned back on them by the fire power that he is always ready to unload. His arsenal usually includes several long guns, two four shot pistols, two other pistols, which are sometimes double slotted, a long knife, and a tomahawk; he is a fighting machine.Johnstone tells us in his stories of the history of the gun and how it effected the settlement of the West. All of his guns in this story are of the muzzle loader type, but at the end of this adventure he is given a set of 44 Colt Walker revolvers which really increased his fire power. All this and the fast draw was pasted onto Smoke Jensen and the rest is History."
1,Blood On The Divide,"Way too much callous violence. Given the era, it was perhaps too true. For my part, I will not purchase anymore of Johnstone's books. I expected his books to be along the lines of L'Amour, which they are to an extent."
1,Worst book in series... By far!!!,This ebook has more mistakes than an.y I've seen. Smoke in this book thinks it's O.K. for a man to rape and murder a girl as long as he's crazy!
1,A Real Disappointment Buy Direct I Learned A lesson.,This Product Proves to Me that CB Radio Died With Streach Pants And The Discoball.This radio Requied Addional products 9 rechareable Batteries = 40 dollars Plus AC and DC power cords.Your are Better off Dealing With Cobra Direct.
2,Hand held CB,I am dissapointed in this product. It doesn't work well inside the car with the standard antenia. I purchased the outside antenia and still have problems receiving and sending.
3,Good product but needs some things. . .,"Overall, a good product, but needs a rechargeable battery pack and needs to be able to pick up and transmit at further distances. This product didn't even transmit or pick up transmission more than a quarter of a mile away."
5,WX works great. AA & 12v are the way to go.,"Got the radio as an emergency item. The WX stations pickup and sound very clear with the included antenna. Glad that the device uses AA. Readily available, many recharging options for AA. Also works off 12v, tested that. Reception with the CB seemed to work fine as well and it does scan. As another reviewer said ( I'm an ex HAM radio technician), the antenna is the key for a radio. If you're worried about reception or transmitting, get something like a roof mounted magnetic antenna for your car. You don't have to mount it until you need it. If you're clever, you can use a spool of wire for this ( I did that for my previous CB and it worked fairly well, but had to tune the antenna first by progressively cutting small amounts off until it worked like I wanted). Haven't tested transmitting with it, but I'm sure it works. If I have problems, I'll head for higher ground and try to retransmit. Cheers!"
4,Not too bad at all..,"It has good receive and limited range with the stock antenna. I bought the extension antenna for it and it does a little better. If you want to be heard farther than 1/2 mile you should go with a mag mount type antenna for your car. To be clear, I'm happy with this radio and i expected the range that it gets..I do have 1 NEGATIVE thing to say about this radio. The weather is hard to pull in on it. When my other weather radios are getting the weather channel clearly, this one just got static. It does get the weather if you're close enough to the tower but, a real weather radio does much better."
3,Suits my current needs,I was looking for a cb I could use on car club road trips to communicate with others in the group. I wanted a hand held because I didn't want to have anything installed on a permanent basis. That said I used it without an antenna on a trip to Northern California with 7 other cars. In order to hear instructions from the lead car I had to be in the second or third slot. I could hear the conversations from cars in the rear but they could not hear me. It suits my needs as long as I'm in second slot which is where I prefer to be anyway. A cross country road trip is being planned for 2009 with many more cars. I will either upgrade by then or have an antenna installed.
1,CB,This item was packed fine and arrived in working order. Takes too many batteries and does not get full power output as described.
1,Bad experience with Cobra 38 ST CB,"I found the COBRA 38 WX ST CB radio to be a poor product as a replacement for an old Radio Shack CB. There is a very annoying persistent side tone at all times which appears to be affected by engine speed. This noise is ever present and cannot be silenced with the volume control. Moreover, on my first outing with this CB, the COBRA HG-A1500 magnet mounted antenna fell off my SUV roof at about 40 MPH. This experience tells me that buying electronic equipment by internet is a mistake."
4,Cobra Handheld,I am finding this CB to be quite adequate for limited range which I require. The weather channels are quite handy and the scanner is an added plus.
1,cobra hh 38 wxst cb radio,"I'm sorry to say but this is a very disappointing radio from cobra. it is very stylish ,but thats it. it lack power/modulation will not key its advertised 4watts regardless, and will pick up noise from everywhere while in a moving vechicle. you would be better off buying a regular cb radio. this one is a waste of money."
4,"Sturdily made, good features, so-so sound quality.","This cb radio works well and is solid. I recommend the longer antenna available, or if you're going to use it in the car, an external antenna (though you have to buy an adaptor for the latter). Taller antennas just get out farther. The range of your signals will increase ALOT. Speaker sound quality is fair; the price you pay for a small unit with a small speaker. The built-in weather channels definitely make it worth the price."
5,great with the right setup,"I didn't want to permantely mount my full size CB in my new Nissan Altima yet as I still can't find a good spot to mount it. So for an upcoming trip to Wisconsin I purchased my first portable hand held unit. With the standard Rubber Duck antenna the reception inside the car is pretty bad, but using a Cobra conversion adapter I've connected my Wilson 1000 mag mount to the portable and reception and transmission is almost as good as my Ranger full size unit."
1,Disappointed,"Without an external antenna, this radio had almost no range. When caravanning on the highway, I could not hear someone 2 cars ahead. I've had better range with walkie-talkies. Volume was low and hard to hear. Granted, my Jeep is very loud on the highway, even with the top up, but it just didn't cut it. After just a few uses, the antenna has now become flaky. There seems to be a loose connection, so if you don't apply pressure to the antenna, it doesn't work all.I was very disappointed in this radio. It was a waste of money."
5,"Wolfgang Puck Chicken Pot Pie Soup, 14.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)",Very good. Lots of chicken and vegatables and flavor.
4,nutritious & filling for my child,"My child has been a lover of Chicken Pot Pie soup since she was 2 years old. She's probably had 3 cans per week over the last 4 years. A full can is just the right serving size for her and it has a nice variety of vegetables. Unfortunately she's not fond of chicken in general, so I give it to her minus the chicken. I'm disappointed that I can't find it in local stores anymore."
1,where's the chicken?,"Where's the chicken is the question I'd like to ask. I found only 2 or 3 small chewy pieces of chicken in a rather thinner soup mixture than I anticipated as it is advertised as ""chicken pot pie"". The taste is bland and I would not purchase it again. In fact I'd like to off load the 11 cans I am left with.I do not recommend this to anyone."
1,Error prone,"Simpson's attributes authorship of a Theodore Roosevelt quote to John F. Kennedy.Theodore Roosevely wrote ""History as Literature"" in 1913. In this work he wrote the famous quote:'It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, and comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.'Simpson's wrongly attributes the quote to Kennedy."
3,Works,Does what I need it to do at a decent price. Disappointed that it's slightly too big. I don't like having to use shims on battery terminals. Different metals lead to corrosion faster when electricity is involved. I got the proper positive and negative terminals & both are slightly over sized.
5,An advanced book even beginners can profit from,"I've been doing exercises from this book nearly everyday since I purchased it and it has improved not only my chops, but the way in which I approach improvisation as well. Although a beginner to jazz will profit from mere repetition of the studies, an advanced or intermediate player will find the harmonic ideas incorporated in the studies to be very advanced and original.Particularly intriguing is his unorthodox approach to fingering, some of which I've incorporated into my playing."
2,There is NO TAB!!!!!!!!,Just an FYI for those who may not know. I didn't see it mentioned anywhere but....YOU MUST BE ABLE TO READ MUSIC to derive any benefit from this book. There is NO TAB!!
4,"TYPICAL STORY, BUT INTERESTING","This is a new begining, remember like in D&D death is not a career ending injury. So what if they brought back some dead caracters, this is not a story of the real world, I mean for crying outloud this is fantasy, So being fantasy is pretty darn good. So Follow that mindset and you will enjoy watching this, I mean if you saw the first series, there was no Parn-Asharam fight and this is what I wanted to see."
2,"Sweet, but disappointing","To give it some, credit, this movie had some good music. I was willing to accept the magically reincarnated characters and the suddenly nonexistent events. I will even tolerate the little kids which spontaneously appear. On its own, its okay, with some interesting alternative plots, but in comparison to the original, it disappointed me severely. The whole mood of the enire story changed. Maybe I was just anticipating a sequel too much. Shoulda known. I recommend giving it a try, though. However, the fast forward button is a must!"
5,An amazing and beautiful story,"Record of the Lodoss war is the most perfect story of war, love and magicks. With an elf, an axeman and other characters. Almost reminicent of book rpg's rounded with the celric... This movie is refreshing and clear, simple and clean"
4,"Very good, but not brilliant clssic fantasy anime","Record of Lodoss War was one of the first to fill the void of fantasy anime. It is in most aspects good but not great: the animation, while very good for the time does show it's age a little bit, and the English voice actors could be much better. But this is still a very good series and if you are into the fantasy genre this is the set to own, ... although the DVDs offer almost nothing in the way of extras.Lodoss War is at least a very easy anime series to own, one of the most well known and regarded fantasy animes and will delight anyone who ever liked Tolkien or D&D;."
5,This anime will hold you spellbound until the very end.,"This is without a doubt the best anime I've ever seen. The intriguing feel of this fantasy anime is absolutely amazing, not to mention the beautifully composed soundtracks. I'll start out by saying that the characters designed by Soeta Kazuhiro were really awesome. The characters are so intriguing and diverse. Very original and well thought out. The story is enthralling and captures your attention many times throughout the show. Some parts are so intense, it brings shivers down your spine. I'm actually not very supportive of dubbed anime, being that I try to stay true to the original Japanese dub, but I have to say the dub for this particular anime was wonderful. The voice of Karla was so amazing that she brought out the character to exceed the Japanese version. In other words, the dubbed version was better then the Japanese version. So, if you haven't bought this anime, I highly suggest you do."
4,"Very good anime, Hmm but plot seems familiar.",This is a great series no doubt about that. The animation is fluent and the soundtrack is awsome (i own copies). What i dont like is that anyone who knows about D&D will insantly recognize a plot much that of the Dragon Lance Chronicals. I recomend its viewing highly though.
5,Loved it!,"I loved this video!The opening animation was fantastic and the music was outstanding.I also like Lisa Ortiz's voice acting in ""The Slayers"" series so when I heard her voice coming from Deedlit's lips I was hooked! There is a few things that didn't peice in very well but if you liked the first series you'll definately like this one."
5,Lodoss rocks,"Im just happy I found this particular series on DVD, in the whole complete series. Being a follower of all things animated for many years (Im still waiting for transformers the movie on DVD) finding a gem like this on DVD makes me happy. Record of the lodoss war to me is along the lines of Heric Legend of Arislna and several other series that take place in the days of swords, dragons and magic as opposed to the cyber anime that seems to be so much more popular. having grown up reading lord of the rings and the hobbit, its just plain nice to know there are series like this that are well done, and worth the money to get on DVD, as a whole series nontheless. THank you amazon!@"
5,A Wonderful Fantasy Anime,"Personally, I cannot see what people have against this series - it's a great fantasy based anime, with likable characters and a good story. This is how Rankin/Bass' JRR Tolkein cartoons *should* have been done! Yes, towards the end of the series, one can see where they were running out of money. Episodes 9-13 are afflicted with lots of single-cel ""brush"" animation, where the un-animated cel is just moved around. However, even this is done well... too bad that it has to happen, this sort of thing is one of the problems that gives anime a bad rap in this country.Anyway, I recommend this anime to anyone who likes a fantasy setting, a quest-based story, and engaging characters."
4,Was the best fantasy series untill I saw Berserk,"This is a great anime fantasy series, it does lack substance to a certain point, but most anime does. It has wonderfull character designs and great artwork. The one thing that bugs me is they kill of my favorite character Orson (the berserker) early in the series. This is deffinately a must for a fantasy anime fan, since there isnt much else out there. If you want to see an awesome fantasy anime series start buying the Berserk DVD's which are being released in March. After seeing Berserk you will be like ""what lodoss war""? TRUST MEOh yea, Berserk is extra violent, so if you dont like lots of blood and violence in your anime you might not like it."
4,The best medieval fantasy anime ever,"Record of Lodoss War is just that - the best fantasy anime ever. It is set on the now very classic medieval world made popular Donjons & Dragons. I found the story to be boring at first, but the fun begins after Episode 7! The graphics, music and sounds are all excellent.Record of Lodoss War is a must-see for any anime or fantasy fan. Excellent serie. I would have given it a four stars and a half but I can't so I give four stars. It is really worth the money it costs."
4,A fine example of fantasy anime,"Record of Lodoss War is the prequel to the recently released Crystania which recieved mixed reviews. Thankfully the original thirteen episodes are well produced and remain a series with an interesting plot and well developed characters. The animation isn't up to the standard of Manga, although it is certainly watchable especially in the DVD format. The series is perhaps best thought of as Dungeons & Dragons on video. There are plenty of exotic monsters and the episodes keep the exitement factor high. With the fantasy anime market not being as overcrowded as the cyber-punk genre, the Record of Lodoss war is an example of anime as it should be. The voice acting is fair and the dialogue is adequately translated. Overall it makes for a good purchase given that all 13 episodes are now available as one."
2,Un Anime pour les gamins!!!,"Si cet anime se laisse regarder, il ne laisse pas grand souvenir: les personnages sont caricaturaux a souhait, l'intrigue est archi-éculée, la musique lassante... Rien a voir avec un Evangelion, Escaflowne ou un Lain! Bref je n'ai pas du tout aimé. Pourtant le monde est interessant, c'est dommage."
3,Average and over hyped,I can not belive the rubish people are writing about this anime. Middle of the road story and nothing special animation. would not be in my top ten
1,over-rated and really just for the D&D fans.,"Truly over rated. Maybe it's because I'm not such a big fantasy person myself, but in my opinion, you have to like D&D (or something like that) to like this anime. I see no other good qualities. If you are not fond or simply never really got attached to rpg's such as D&D, skip this anime.I had heard alot of this anime before I watched it and heard from a friend that it was very good. I read the reviews on amazon.com and thought that one bad review out of 4 or 5 wasn't bad. So I rented the first dvd first. It was horrible! I was so bored I took about 3 breaks in the middle of the first episode! Its truly just for the D&D fans. So in my opinion...I didn't like it."
5,Love it!,"Best anime I've seen yet. I'm a big fan of fantasy, and this was simply awesome. My one complaint, and it's minor, is that the animations for the ancient dragons was less than stellar. But it's a great story, with well-developed characters. All I can say is this: Get it."
5,"Record of Lodoss War, boxed set","This show is a very well done sword-and-sorcery tale of adventure and Tolkien-esque high fantasy, influenced by Dungeons and Dragons. I highly recommend at least giving it a watch, if not buying it."
4,Daughters gift very satisfied,my daughter loves it she has been a record of lodoss fan since it originally came out many years ago. She is very happy with the product.
5,A wonderful re-telling,"Some people who have seen the first series may be confused by this- this series is basicly a re-telling of the second part of the first series. This is commenly done in Japan. I completely enjoyed this video, and I recommend it highly-- it is beautiful, animated well, with great music (check out the opening!!) If you understand that this is a re-telling and NOT a direct sequel, you should enjoy this."
5,Mesmerizing and Addictive,"I was first given a copy of this series opener from a friend who was into anime.The opening scene completely took my breath away and the narration grabbed my attention and would not release it. This has to be THE best series I have ever seen.(just ask the poor employees at suncoast videos...i pestered them to no end) I have to say if you enjoy a good medieval plot with fantasy streaked straight through it ...you have found it. It will reel you in , make you laugh, pull at them heart strings of even the most shriveled of hearts, and rejoice in glory of battle! See the prologe and get hooked."
3,As good as the original,This is a DVD that is as good as the original. If you want an inexpensive compilation of the series DVD is the way to go. But don't expect a incredible visual experience. The DVD seems to be mearly a transfer from VHS.
4,"I know 32 other people have reviewed it, but...","OK. I'll get down to the point. I'm not a big anime fan. Akira and Ghost in the Shell, but that's it. Then I came across this DVD collection, and thought I'd give it a shot. After all, I was saving myself 50% of what VHS buyers were paying for. Let me tell you, I became engrossed. A fantasy tale told in thirteen chapters, all in two DVDs! The art is excellent, the story is great, and even the voice acting is decent. The chapter search is a great benefit, which allows you to go to your favorite scenes again. And did I mention the price? The only minus I can think of is that it does appear to be just a transfer from VHS, so if you own the original set, don't bother with the DVD. Also, I never liked the ending. It was good, but for five hours I wanted something a little more. In the end, this has become my favorite anime, period."
4,Like watching a fantasy book.,The series was easier to follow than most anime movies. I also enjoyed the character building aspect and the detail given to these characters. The movie was as much interesting as it was action orienting.
4,"Hmm, its good","The art was great, and the story was good. The animation was well done and the color was also great."
4,Get this right NOW,"Lodoss Wars is just plain awesome, the only thing that ticked me off was that in the later episodes the subtitles won't appear at times, this got to be very annoying. If it wasn't for that I woulda given it 5 stars. Still, don't let that keep you from grabbing this especially at the low price of $40!!"
4,Fantasy RPG turns Anime,"If you've ever played Dungeons and Dragons, the first three episodes of this series will seem very familiar. While it has it's roots in the traditional roleplaying game, within a few episodes it develops a universe all it's own - and has some nice surprise twists in the plot. A very good example of anime. And a lot of fun. Great value!"
5,"great animation, story, and, music",If you like anime you will love this movie it is up top of my favorits list even if you don't like anime this will probly make you.
4,this tape is awsome but nowhere close to th origanal series,This is the second tape in the series and it was better than the first. It has some very good fighting sceens and also a fight with a dragon. The animation was good and the plot is cool. This is a good anime if you like the role palying type of plot.
5,I agree totally-this is a MUST OWN Christmas disc,"I agree totally-this is a MUST OWN Christmas disc. It is masterfully recorded, gorgeously sung, and most of all, includes many pieces rarely recorded. There are some carols that SHOULD have been recorded; they are that haunting & beautiful. Seamlessly woven; a superb CD that is so good, I actually listen to it year round."
5,An excellent 2nd or 3rd book on grammar and linguistics,"This book is wonderful. It contains a bevvy of information on syntactic structures, not just in the English language, but from languages around the world. It is not, as some might expect, a ""do-this-don't-do-that"" prescriptivist manual on how to write or speak; if that is what you need, look elsewhere. There are plenty of books that can tell you not to end sentences with prepositions, or what a split infinitive is. This book explores living language in all of its wonderful vitality."
2,Not helpful for me,"I'm studying to be an English teacher, and I had to buy this book for a linguistics course. My teacher didn't much care for the book's explanation of Chomsky's diagramming system, which is a matter of personal taste I guess. What I didn't like is how freakin' unhelpful the book (and the course, for that matter) will be when I'm trying to correct my kids' papers for grammar."
3,Looking for the Poser in you (pardon my pun),"A fair mixture of textures and creativity. This software bears the elements of good design (Its compatible with other software - Macromedia Director, Fireworks, and Photoshop - and for that I am truely greatful). However I found that the price is a tweened high for the benefit. Granted anyone cannot simply make plugins like this. It does take a certain level of knowledge to produce such professionalism and that ""ism"" is why I give it three stars. I suppose I sound a bit cynical. I hope not; this truely is a great piece of work. I would not barr anyone from purchasing it, unless they just want another toy to add to their collection. On the other hand if they are looking for a high end toy that can do a lot for their images, this would be a great addition. I guess that's what prevents me from giving five stars - its like a toy, there is a lot you can do with this however it just reamins that well, its another toy to me!"
3,Will it run?,I have a computer with 6GB of RAM and Intel i3. Will Windows 2000 run? Its OK if Windows uses only 2GB RAM and Windows 7 has the other 4GB. I will keep Windows 2000 on my 1TB external HDD will 32 Bit Operating Systems accept a 1TB HDD?
5,It may be old but it still works like a charm.,"I purchased the Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional operating system as a fix for a another failing Windows 2000 operating system. I didn't feel the need to upgrade any further. However, Windows 2000 is no longer supported by Microsoft but several service packs are still available online. I had a personal preference to keep with this operating system and since my older laptop is back up and running I have no complaints."
3,OKAY book,"Interesting read, a lot of detail on clothing worn by main character which can be boring and I often skimmed it. Story overall was good and kept my interest"
3,An engaging tale . . .,"The story is very engaging, but fairly easy to see the outcome. Characters are well drawn, but very little attention seems to have been given to the beginning or end. The story starts abruptly and ends the same. The writing style reminds me more of a short story as the characters aren't allowed too much angst in their conflicts before a resolution; but actually, this is probably more like real life in my experience. I personally get very annoyed with conflicts that boil on for a long time, so I'd say that swift resolutions aren't necessarily a bad thing. The writer does fill in with quite a bit of interesting things - making soap, catsup, dress styles of the period which will be of real interest to some, but will turn others off. On the plus side, I felt that I did get to know the characters and care about them, so that makes it worthwhile read for me that allows me to overlook the flaws."
4,Sometimes You Have To Take A Chance,"This is a new twist on the old classic rags to riches story. After everything falls apart in Ireland, Tessa gambles everything that she has left on a one way ticket to America. Fate continues to make her life seem bad. Of course, things have to get worse before they can get better.In all this was a very nice, well told story. The mix of deception, mystery, riddles and romance serves to keep the reader entwined in the story. Heck if you pay attention you might even learn to make soap. The early Virginia setting makes the story all the more interesting. Nicely done Ms. Hodapp.Recommendation: RECOMMENDEDTim Hancock is the Director of MWLA, a Reviewer and Author"
1,kattywatty,"Nope!!! This book is the stupidest book I have read in a long time. It is the most mixed up convulated story I have read.Two women meet on a ship....one from England..rich, one from Ireland..poor. Both have red hair..could pass for sisters. One dies...guess who? And it goes on and on. Don' t get this book. Ick."
3,:/,"I love to read, and this is the first book in a while that I didn't ever want to keep reading. To be honest, I only finished it, because I like to finish what I start. I was often frustrated because EVERYTHING was way to predictable, and the author embellished more on what Tessa was wearing and cooking than she did the actual plot and events. The ending was rushed through. I felt like i was reading two separate short stories rather than one novel. I feel kind of shocked that this book costs $16.00 +, it wasn't a very good quality either, some words were missing, or spelled incorrectly."
4,Very interesting. I learned a lot,"This is about a lady that goes to America by herself after her husband dies in the 1700's. She has to make a life for herself. The book is full of descriptions of the clothing, customs, and lifes of the people of that time in America. It even has some recipes."
2,Disappointed,"I really wanted to like this book because the story was a good idea but the writing was severely lacking. It got two stars just for that aspect only, otherwise, it would have received one. I found myself skipping large parts of the day to day life and nearly all the descriptions of her dresses. How many times do you need to be told EVERY detail about them?Several times the same information would be repeated later in the story. At about the halfway point on the Kindle Fire the story appeared to be nearly over and I wondered if something was wrong with the Fire. Nothing. The book took on a whole other life of its own from then on.Character development was slim to none. The whole story just seemed mixed up or confusing or I can't think of a good word for it, but definitely a different method of writing. The ending was abrupt and felt just thrown together.There were also a number of discrepancies with the historical aspect. If I didn't get it for free, I would not have been happy."
2,Multiple authors?,"This story started out fine but transitioned into what seemed to be a second author somewhere in the middle. There were also several implausible scenarios - a doting grandmother turning the only child of her only child over to someone she barely knew instead of keeping him herself despite having the space and means to do so and an extremely sprightly 70+ store owner moving in and out of retirement (did folks live that long in the late 1700s?) as two examples. In addition, there were numerous typos/errors. The book did contain ample detail on various aspects of daily life during that time period - gardening, preserving food, etc. - but most of the dialog and underlying assumptions in the story seemed current. I got this book during a free day. If I had paid the current $14.69 price, I'd be really unhappy."
2,"Chastain's futile ""attempt"" at fusion","Charting the path of Chastain's albums you can see he went from style to style starting with neoclassical to shred to fusion to acoustic and all points in between. My first experience started with Elegant Seduction, which was great. The songs were to the point, had great melodies and great shred. However, on Next Planet Please it seemed Dave was trying out an effects processor. Sure, some of the riffs are pretty cool, although very simplistic, and he gets a pretty nice glassy sound on his cleans but there are no real song structures and the solos are endless. I wouldn't mind if they were good solos but he just noodles the night away as he tries to find his way back to the main melody/riff. I would recommend Elegant Seduction as a first album if you're just getting into Chastain. If you're looking for fusion go with Tribal Tech, Weather Report, Allan Holdsworth, Gambale/Hamm/Smith."
5,"Step asside Linksys, DLINK, Cisco. A Better switch is here.","These are great switches and just as fast as the compitition with ONE exception.. THEY DONT BREAK!I've used them all and the major complaint I have with most home switches is the HEAT they generate. You can put money down that Your Cisco Linksys or DLINK switch is going to last about a year. They do give you a warranty and an easy replacement but I would rather buy a switch that I didnt need to exorcise the return policy every 1-2 years thank you very much.The ProCurve Switches use external brick type power supplies that keep the heat away from your switch processor. This May be an issue for Business applications that use rack mounting, but for home use ProCurve hits a Home Run!"
5,A great home gigabit switch,"I have this switch in the basement of my house, connecting the ethernet network for the home. It has a great build quality, is compact without sacrificing anything, and stays very cool. Plus the lifetime warranty can't be beat!"
5,Works like it should,"I was told that high volume through cheaper switches can cause overheating and erratic performance, so I looked for a better quality switch and found the HP ProCurve to be both highly recommended and carries a lifetime warranty. I replaced the switch in our office system that affected my computer and after several months of use I and the others using it have ceased to have issues.Slow speeds and hangs were a frustration at one of our point of purchase terminals, so I recently replaced the switch that affected that terminal with a ProCurve and everything now runs as it should. I'm no IT pro, but these seem to have cured some of our IT guy's ""software problems."""
5,great stuff,I recently purchased this book. It is exactly what I was looking for. The contents tell exactly how to design a concrete mixture. This book is am eleventh edition put out by the Portland Cement Association dated July 1968. I have a 1956+/_ edition but wanted an updated version. The price wwas very reasonable.
2,An Inch Deep and a Mile Wide,"All the major events are covered, but there is little or no analysis/detailed description of those events. If you have little or no previous knowledge of Napoleon, this book would leave you thinking that the battle of Austerlitz was really not a big deal at all.Very disappointing read."
4,"The Rise, and Reign, of Napoleon Bonaparte","I bought the two volumes to help fill in my knowledge of the 19th Century in Europe. I had recently completed a book about the French Revolution, and thought a book about Napoleon might be a good next step.Asprey's two volumes are very good. I was pleased with the detail (there are about 1,000 pages for the two volumes), although I sometimes got lost a bit with the places and people names."
3,Napoleon's early life through the lens of military history,"This book is the first of a two-volume biography of Napoleon wriotten by a former U.S. Marine Captain. It is cast in a straightforward chronological scheme and delivered in concise and easily readable chapters. Military history buffs especially will enjoy and find a wealth of details of individual campaigns from Toulon to Austerlitz (1805) which is where this first volume ends. There are also passages on Napoleon's personal life, including his boyhood and courtship of and marriage to Josephine Beauharmais. The heavy emphasis on military history and otherwise on personal life tends to overshadow discussion of the political context of Napoleon's career in post-recolutionary France and an emerging new European geopolitical order. Altogeher, a well-researched and documented volume."
2,not great,"Lots of Who's and where's, very little to generate interest in the book. It also stops abruptly at the battle of austerlitz leaving one wondering what happens next. I found it difficult to stay interested in."
1,A Dull Read,"This book is a mostly adulatory review of Napoleon's rise to power. For instance Mr. Asprey's speculates about what a cozy future Europe might have had had Napoleon only managed to compete his vision and unit all Europe under one banner. One might recall that other leaders had the same vision (e.g.: the Kaiser, Hitler et al). Although Mr. Asprey is billed as a former marine the book frequently reads as if written by someone with a narrow grasp of English. One example suffices. ""Desaix who held the right formed his divisions into battalion squares about 300 yards across the front and 50 yards down the sides."" This leaves one with the speculation that perhaps battalion squares are different from ordinary ones. If your ambition is to know more about Napoleon than you started with this book fits the bill, but it's a hard slog."
1,There are too many books on Napoleon's biography,"This is yet another rehash of Napoleon's life. Its been done before, many, many times. This book does not yield and new insights into Napoleon's life. For the price, there are cheaper alternatives."
4,Great Story Shines Through Clipped Military Prose,"The story of Napoleon Bonaparte is one of the truly great stories of history and could be told well by virtually anyone. Robert Asprey is no exception. The tale and the book are both gripping and compelling. However, Asprey dallies a bit much on numbers of 'cannon' and 'biscut' and not enough time on the great historical ripples Napoleon caused, or the great aura and the great essence of one of the most influential and genius men history has seen. Also, there are surprisingly few anecdotes (the book written afterall by a former Marine captain) of Napoleon's actions which so endeared him to his men. Still, the book is a great read; those interested in Napoleon should enjoy it with no small degree of zeal. To get the slightest atom of feeling as though one is living in the mind of a great man like Napoleon is always wonderful beyond words."
1,The color star,The black cut outs aren't cut acurately. I'd like to return this item to you and exchange it. A group of us purchased it for a class and I DON'T KNOW the account number. So how do i get it back into the mail and maybe get one that has been cut acurately? Thank you
3,Just a set of wheels,"Very disappointed by the ""book"", which actually consists of a set of wheels,with a 4-page booklet which does not explain much. I returned the book."
3,Seems very expensive,"How can the color wheel cost $976.98 on Amazon.com and CDN$ 23.93 on Amazon.ca? WHY, HOW can a set of papper discs and a booklet cost over nine hundred Dollars?"
1,very unhappy,"This book was quite disappointing. It is a very small (tiny ) book with some templates and these were poorly done. I had bought it for an art class I was teaching, and ended up returning the book."
1,I am speechless,"This book may depend with the reader, but to this reader... It really wasn't... Something that one would wish to read again.The writing structure WAS quite nicely done, but the story itself was more seemingly ""fantasized"" for young readers. The way the story seemed to lead went showed more ""imagination of the author"" than what may have really happened. Ms. Newcomb showed her writing style in this book, but seemed to show more of her linguistic ways than Leonardo da Vinci's lifestyle. She did try to capture the reader by using her novel-ish ways, but if it was written like a biography (instead of a novel), things may have had a brighter side.But... This is only in my opinion. All readers aren't the same anyway."
4,A great styling iron!!,"This is a great styling iron for your hair, the ease of use is a plus - not to mention the fact that it's curved making it much better than any Flat iron."
3,Andis curved flat iron,Heats up quickly and the curved plates make it easy to flip hair up and or curve under after you flat iron. It's almost like having a flat iron and a half curling iron in one. Convenient.
4,I Love it,This is one of the best flat iron's I've purchased. I love how it can curl or flip my hair and takes a quarter of the time a curling iron would. The only negative is if you don't use smooth actions it makes indents in your hair.
4,Super smooth hair,This straight iron does NOT pull your hair and it leaves your hair super smooth! This is a must have for my hair!
2,doesn't provide what I expected,"not a rip-off, however, the curved plates made no difference towards rounding out edges of a smooth style. I have better luck with my chi ceramic (2001 version) flat iron."
4,Mix of Country and Americana,1. Midnight On The Stormy Deep-Bill Monroe2. The Shape I'm In-Seldon Scene3. Oh Atlanta-Bad Company4. One Of Two-Gary Chapman5. Love Is The Ride-Lucy Kaplansky6. Call Of The Honky Tonk-High Noon7. Don't Call Me Crazy-Libbi Bosworth8. Good Good Wife-The Picketts9. Bluegrass Boy-Peter Rowan10. Long White Cadillac-Dave Alvin and the Guilty Men
4,Real and Refreshing,"Although this Cemetery Dance Publication didn't have as many horror elements as I would have liked or expected, I enjoyed this addictive novella a lot. Retribution, Inc fits perfectly into a novella format. I had such a smile on my face as I read this because I felt I had known many of the book's same characters thoughout my life. The music scene, at least here in New York, was very accurate. The situations were believable and the dialogue flowed comfortably and honestly. I was very much into the initial twist of the story, but expected Cooper to delve a little deeper into Ernie and his guitar. But regardless, this is certainly worth reading, especially if you are a musician or ever in any band. I look forward to reading more of Geoff Cooper."
5,different and exciting,"I think this cd is excellent, it offers something new. It is not like any other spanish cd I have ever heard. Their melodies are catchy and their dance songs make you want to get up and move. I recomend anyone to buy it if they love harmonies and music you can dance to. It is great!!!"
4,A Shot Rolling Ship (John Pearce),"Another great read from a fun,John Pearce, adventure series, great beach, vacation or business trip read, this is a book to just relax and enjoy."
2,60% dull,"I consider myself to be an avid diver and reader, so I'm naturally drawn to books that cover a wide berth of topics regarding the ocean and diving. This particular book I had a difficult time wanting to finish. The perspective of the stories were grossly limited by both the recurrent theme of being a new/first time diver and by the fact that few were written after the mid 1970's. There are a few gems amongst the chapters, Dave Berry's lobstering for instance, but the wade through the rest of the book was tiresome. My advise is do not purchase, visit the Library and be willing to skip large portions."
3,To Random and Hard to Read,This book has some good information in it but it is poorly put together and extremely hard to read.
1,An awful source for architects!,"I was given this book as a gift, and thought I would enjoy seeing conventions used by other architects in a organized fashion. I am EXTREMELY DISSATISFIED with this book. The book is mostly boring text, littered with poor graphics and inaccurate information. While reading the book, it became quite obvious that the author is not from The United States - conventions were definitely foreign to this architect's eyes. Drawings have been reduced to fit the book such that they are now illegible blurs on a page (with annoying text right over top of them). Code information is wrong (the Texas plan reviewers will be thrilled to hear that Texas has no governing building code according to this text). Also, while this book is packed with related information I find it really suspect that not even one source was cited.Come-on what is this?!? I wouldn't force my worst enemy to read this."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This book is a conglomeration of graphics, codes(wrong), details, etc. I was looking for a decent guide to standardize drawing sets and came upon this book. I glanced through it and bought it. What a mistake!"
3,Good but Overpriced,"We are Germans and love dumplings, but the exact same product is available in shops for half price.Otherwise authentic German food."
3,Not bad,"This album wasn't exactly what I expected from her. After listening to her 531 album and her Roots album, I was hoping this to be even better than the last. Instead, this album was too funky and wasn't at all like her. Sure, Keydoor was a good song for the album, but it just wasn't her style. Buy it if you want, but I recommend her Roots album."
5,Looking for a friend? Try these ideas...,"I've been a Steven Kellogg fan for nearly 20 years now. His work is original, engaging, and entertaining. He does his own illustrations which ""make"" his stories come to life for me.In this book by Kellogg a lonely little boy is in search of a friend. In the natural course of events the little boy either brings home or asks his mother if he can bring home animal after animal for a pet. Thus the book's title, ""Can I Keep Him?"" His mother's responses are typical, but the translation of her responses in her son's head (shown in picures also done by Kellogg) are hilarious!A definite hit with children and adults alike!Give it a try.Definitely 5 stars.Alan Holyoak"
5,Children love this book!,"Arnold wants a pet and his imagination is off and running. Arnold's mother guides him gently in the right direction, but not before Arnold comes up with some wildly inappropriate choices. Steven Kellogg's illustrations are delicious. This is one of my children's favorite books. Now that they are older, they buy this book for every little kid they can think of. Don't miss it!"
1,I suppose you get what you pay for.,"I purchased this because it was one of the least expensive straight razors on Amazon. It is of very cheap construction. Though advertised as ""Diamond Edge"", the brand name printed on the item is actually ""Burmax"". If 'Diamond Edge' is supposed to be a description instead of a brand, then it should be noted that the edge of a diamond is apparently quite dull, blunt and weak; I spent over an hour trying to sharpen it, then used the strop, and it is still useless as a shaver. I would recommend that anyone considering buying this spend some extra money and get a different, better blade."
4,The World Must Know,This book is very informative and educational. It is full of pictures and easy reading to describe such a horrific event in history. This is a great teacher tool!
5,dispences the most information I've seen,"This is a wonderful learning tool for people just begining to take interest in the holocaust as well for those who are well educated in its matters.The photogaphs are haunting but extremely well taken and truthful.The author, Michael Berenbaum, captured the truth behind the unhuman treatment the Jews recieved throughout the history of the holocaust.I reccomend you read this book because it is difficult to forget it's contents."
1,Do not buy this pillow case,I bought these pillow cases thinking they would be better than something you would find at Walmart. They felt great when we opened them. They are good thick pillow cases but after one wash they felt rough but I used the pillow for a few weeks in hope that the pillow case might feel better. The pillow case started to pill and within a month the entire pillow case is ruined. Do not buy!!!
4,Debut winner from Cantrell - 4 stars,"Terrific debut from Cantrell who deserves all the success of fellow folkies Krauss, Gillian Welch, etc. Song after song puts a smile on your face. My three favorites are: Not The Tremblin' Kind, Little Bit of you and Two Seconds, although there isn't a bad one in the bunch. Her sophomore disc, When The Roses Bloom Again, is even better!"
2,what are people thinking,"This woman's voice is really annoying and her style is seriosuly affected, as in possessing affectations, inauthentic. She sings out of key, and with a really fake accent. Her husband is a producer so I think that is why they get made. Her music may sound like what you want to hear, but is actually derivatitve, and self-aware, and as such represents the problem with alt country sometimes. So if this sounds good to you check out The Be Good Tanyas, Tara Nevins, Dolly Parton, Tammy Wynette, Gillian Welch, Loretta Lynn, Emmylou Harris, Michelle Shocked, Cowboy Junkies, etc., instead.""Not the tremblin kind"" sounds like a suburban girl's, art-school dropout view of a noble redneck woman or something- ridiculous."
1,big dissapointment,"I really love country, if it's bluegrass or modern country or hillybilly or honkeytonkstyle, but lord this Cd is not country not a bit of it, maybe independent or what ever, a terrible voice and the sound , well who like it, might like it, but forme it is one of my worst buys I ever did, well I could only say leave your hands off it and buy other country Cd's"
4,Straightforward and sweet,I recently purchased this CD based on Amazon reviews alone. I have not been disappointed. It reminds me of early Nanci Griffith and her voice is at times strikingly like Lucinda Williams. She seems to be relaxed and enoying herself as she sings through the well penned songs. A number of the songs are quite singable as well.
4,She's the real thing,"I learned about Cantrell several years ago from the Radio Thrift Shop program she used to host on independent radio (google it, the shows are still available) but it took me a while to listen to her records and still longer to post a short review.Cantrell is a fantastic singer and songwriter whose understanding and appreciation of her musical heritage is evident in every song on this record. She writes great melodies, hooks and lyrics:For the next ten years she rode around on the bus.She did washin' and ironin' and pickin' up.She had a place to stand at the back of the stage.She was there every night, lookin' her age.That's from Queen of the Coast. The title track, The Whiskey Makes You Sweeter and Two Seconds of Your Love are also great."
4,This album owns compared to all the other crap in the genre!!,"To start off, this is one of drowningman's finest albums. They interlace it with their familiar formula; long song titles that bring a smile to your face and melodies that inspire the wasted brain youth of this culture. The album starts off with ""yeah you're pretty..."" and if you are digging this shiz check it out the rest only improves. My favorite tracks are ""major disappointment...."" and ""luck love life...."". I can listen to those songs almost every waking day without a question. They are very inspirational and fit my mood completely. To whomever loves drowningman please pick up this album, you will not be disappointed, trust me! To whomever doesn't know drowningman check them out, it might be one of your best purchases. For kindred spirits I would have to say.... no one really just drowningman. Check out their back catalog also because this album defines their whole career in one package."
1,Not an honest inquiry,"This book does not pretend to be an investigation into linguistics or history. It is a religious tract written by a person of deep beliefs, asserting opinions to forcefully argue his beliefs. It is worthwhile visiting the author's website, easily googled, which describes his goals and covers his arguments on other ""scientific"" matters, like creationism.If you have already decided that Jewish scriptures refer to the trinity, and want to argue the point, you will find this book handy as ammunition. If you want to find out _whether_ there is a factual basis for finding the trinity in Jewish scripture, you'll need to look elsewhere."
5,Much needed response,"With United Pentecostalism and so many anti-Trinitarian groups on the rise, this book is needed now more than ever. It is always assumed by such groups that the Trinity was a creation by councils beginning in the third century and then adopted. Mr. Natan shows convincingly from the Hebrew the truthfulness of Jesus' words in John 5:39. As a Lutheran pastor I would recommend this book to all Christian clergy and laity alike who desire a deeper understanding of the Trinity. This book would also be a great gift to someone who has bought into the anti-Trinitarian arguments thinking that it was a creation of the post-apostolic church. Although I have numerous books in my library that show the doctrine of the Trinity to be faithful to Scripture this is the first book that actually examines this belief on the basis of the Old Testament. This is a MUST READ! Highly recommended."
1,"poorly written, shoddily researched","The writing level of this book is junior-high to put it kindly. Not to mention the various stories are thinly researched. In the Douglas/Bendict case, much of what was known to be rumour is stated as fact, and some factual events were mis-interpreted. If you want to know about the murder of Robin Benedict (and it is a fascinating case), ""Missing Beauty"" is much more well-written and thoroughly researched.I dont know as much about the other cases reported in this book, but the poor writing style coupled with the errors and gaps in the Benedict story make them very suspect."
2,Not Much Regarding Bias Here!,"If you are looking for specific information regarding the bias grain, special considerations, and how to sew garments with it, you will not find a THING here between the covers of this book! There is not a single page devoted to actually sewing a bias-cut garment, therefore I found the title misleading. There is no ""dressmaking"" anywhere to be found! However, if you are looking for pattern-drafting info, this book would be great. Any of these garments could be worked up on the straight grain as easily as the bias, so there really is nothing here specific to bias at all. A tad disappointing."
1,Bias-Cut Dressmaking,"I waited three months for this book to be published - paid FULL price for it and was I DISAPPOINTED in the lack of sewing information for bias dressmaking.Yes, I agree that it is a VERY misleading title.Don't waste your money........."
1,BEWARE! ! !This is not rechargeable! False advertisement!,"I purchased this mouse thinking it was rechargeable(due to the fact the ad and my receipt said that it is rechargeable), it's not! They sent me three mouse's to make up for this and to get me the right mouse. Every mouse they sent me was not rechargeable! Finally they had to refund me because they could not provide me with a rechargeable mouse! My receipt even said rechargeable mouse! This is completely misleading and unprofessional!FALSE ADVERTISEMENT! Better business burue was contacted about this situation! Completely 100% dissatisfied with The company and with Amazon.com! Will not use your service again! Absolute HORROR! ! !PAIN IN THE BUTT! ! ! !"
3,scratches and all,Nice bit of mellow latin Diz with the Gonzalez brothers pre their time with Eddie Pamieri and Patato valdez. Whats so surprising is this has been remastered (for want of a better word) from a needle drop on an original bit of prettyy shagged out vinyl click click click.Begs the question Is it an authorised release? Hmmm!
3,Ok book...but...has errors,"This is a decent book, but...there are a number of errors in it. Be sure and get the corrections from the publisher at:http://mercury.larkbooks.com/glaze/correct.pdfhttp://mercury.larkbooks.com/glaze/index.pdfOther than that, it is a good book on glaze materials, mixing, and application. Includes a variety of recipies for use at various cone temps.Updated info...the second printing has corrected the errors that I mentioned above."
3,"Great book, but loads of mistakes and errors","As a potter, I really enjoy the complete line of books but out by Lark. They tend to be very easy to understand, and contain wonderful, inspiring photos of work by a wide variety of potters.This book, however, is filled with errors. Not just typos, but actual errors. For example, three of the recipes losted in the back all have the same formula. There are places where the wrong chemical is listed (manganese instead of magnesium, for example).Lark has posted a correction compendium on their web site, and the thing is 4 pages long!As good as this book is for information, my advice would be to wait for a reprint which corrects the errors."
2,Lack of Editing,"Upholding the tradition of great pictures, this Lark book introduces a great concept of including pictures with every glaze recipe featured. Included as a teaching aid are pictures of raw materials at various temperatures- great idea! However, this book is an *editing fiasco*. The publishers have issued pages of corrections that amount to one mistake every other page. Many mistakes have occurred in the amounts of glaze ingredients, the ingredients themselves, misspellings, and lack of hazardous materials warnings on half of the recipes. If you are new to glaze formulation, skip this book and wait for the reprint. If you still want to purchase this, make sure to contact Lark Press through their web site for corrections."
1,Glazes,"You better look for another book if you really want to learn about making glazes. The book by John Britt, The Complete Guide to High-Fired Glazes is a much better example of a well written glaze making book."
4,Do NOT taste like sugar free cookies.,"Good stuff. I despise the taste of processed sweetners and I was hesitant about what they would taste like, but I was not disappointed. They are very good. Highly recommended."
3,Disappointed with Amazon,"Not sure how I feel about the product, Murray Sugar Free Cookies. My disappointment is with Amazon for sending EXPIRED COOKIES. After notifying Amazon I received an apology email and a new delivery was sent to recipent. I was shocked to receive a second call from the recepient that the 2nd delivery was also EXPIRED having the same expiration date as the first delivery. Next thing I know I receive an email from Amazon my money is being refunded. Have no idea what happened. I was embarrassed and disappointed the first time. Imagine my embarrassment the second time. The recepient is a diabetic and loves Murray Sugar Free Cookies but she is only able to find Shortbread in our stores and Peanut Butter is her favorite."
5,great alternative for diabetics,"Have a family member that is diabetic, so I always keep some of these on hand for when we get together and standard sweets are not an option. Very tasty. They used Splenda, so that will be a pro or con to you, depending on if you like it.I am very thankful for these cookies for helping to provide a bit or normalcy for this family member. Just like normal cookies, but sugar-free. Several great varieties. Worth a try if you are looking for a sugar-free cookie."
5,Very tasty for sugar free,I really enjoy these cookies. Even those that have shared with me enjoy them too. Just enough in 1 packet.
3,Do you like Sweet cookies?,"If you like your cookies SWEET, you will love these!!! I like sweets, but Ididn't care for the sweetness of these. But, keep in mind, this is only my opinion.My family loves sweet iced tea (this is the South, afterall) but I like my tea a little bit sweet, so this may be your to your liking.I have eaten the chocolate with creme inside - Murray cookies and they are okay (I don't like oreos) and they are not too sweet. I really wanted to like these, especially considering that I bought a case. I cannot find it locally, so had to try it here. I was extremely disappointed.They are over the top sweet. I will give them to the grandkids and see if they like them. If not, I will donate the unopened to the church pantry. I know others will appreciate them.I hope Murray reads this and cuts back on the sweetness, so I can enjoy a diabetic friendly shortbread cookie or gives a choice."
5,Healthy family,"I was looking for something sweet that I as a diabetic and my husband and son could all share. Usually if it says sugar free then it means it has a chemical taste. But not these cookies they taste just like the regular cookies. I highly recommend them. You do not have to be a diabetic to eat them. They are made with splenda and I use splenda in a lot of things, I also use the brown sugar splenda in my cooking. These cookies are great."
5,A shout-out to those of us who want to maintain a healthy weight!,"Due partially to the use of Splenda, Murrays makes the best-tasting sugar free cookies out there. But don't forget they still have carbs! Chocolate chip is my personal favorite."
4,Good Sugar Free Cookies - Recommended,"I have tried several types of Murray sugar free cookies and can say that they have all been good and the ""Fudge Dipped Mint Cookies"" are no exception. These are not quite as good as regular cookies but, being diabetic friendly, are a good alternative.Recommended!"
4,Nice spoon from the Peoples Republic of China,Why pay the vigorish to rosle who is now having there products made in china when you can buy a made in china product from a company that doesn't hide that fact? I like that it doesn't have the hook at the end which gets caught with other utensils in the utensil pot but not this one. So it's convenient. Wish it was made in the USA.
3,"Good product, but has a glitch or two","I love the look of the unit. The picture is great and the built-in DVD player is simple to use. However, if your cable provider uses channel 1 for anything (we have a local station that does a continuous loop of the latest news broadcast on 1) this set will not tune it. Every other TV with an electronic tuner I've ever owned can tune channel 1. Volume level is inconsistant when switching between TV and DVD. Comfortable DVD sound level will blast you out on TV."
2,"Great Idea, but Poor Execution","I first bought this TV as an open box item, because there were none in stock. I used it for two days and then it developed horizontal lines and a shadow effect in the picture. I took it back and bought another one, which had never been used. It has really bad color quality in the TV portion and a buzzing sound on one of the speakers. I plan to return it also. Too bad, because I love the operational ease of the DVD player - and not having to have an additional piece of equipment."
4,Excellent Value,"We picked this television up several weeks ago and have been pleased with the picture quality and ease of use. This television has the same or better picture quality than most of the televisions selling for twice the cost. We enjoy the integrated DVD and our 9 year old can easily operate this television.The only complaint we have is that the remote is pretty weak. Unless you have a straight shot at the television from within 10 feet, it has trouble picking up the signal.Other than that, I can't imagine picking up a television with this level of picture quality for less money. I would give it 5 stars if it were not for the remote."
2,Not so good as I though,"Well, I bought this TV 3 months ago. First it seems very good equipment and with a great brand. Now I figured out it's not. I live outside US so Westinghouse is not in my country (Venezuela), and the DVD is not working properly. When you insert a CD/DVD, the screen just goes crazy and shows like half the DVD (in bad resolution) and half the freezing of what you have been seeing before. It was so bad! Piece of junk this TV."
4,Great Great Great,This book is up in the top 5 books I've read. It absolutely great. That Princes is one heck of a b*tch! It wasn't very hard for me to hate her! But my feelings about characters quickly change throughout the book. One minute I love a character and the next I hate them with my guts! But I liked that. It kept me more interested in the book.The one thing I didn't like was that it started to drag in the end. But where it started to drag there was only like 20 pages left so it was ok. PICK UP THIS BOOK AND READ IT!! YOU WONT REGRET IT!
2,What was she thinking?,"All right- I usually enjoy reading Jude Deveraux's books. I don't understand what happened with this one. Love triumphs in the end, but did the characters have to be so cardboard? The spoiled brat, the spoiled brat, the amazing situation... la la la. Formula failed on this one, it's time to try something new."
3,It Was ...OKaY,"The book wasn't that bad. It was an OK romance. There were some things it lacked and I have a few complaints to make:- the ""hero"" is a bit... annoying. He's mean to the ""Princess""but she still falls in love w/ him. How typical- the ending. What kind of ending is that? It sucked! Overallthe story wasn't that bad... but the ending sure needed work"
3,Another wonderful Summer book!,"I love reading Jude Deveraux's books ~~ I can count on her to carry me away into a different time and land ~~ better than any other Calagon moment!This book, however, is not her best. While it is an entertaining read ~~ I felt that she rushed through the ending too quickly and wrapped it up nice and neatly. That is why I rated this book a three.Aria was kidnapped and thrown overboard to die. However, she was rescued by J.T. Montgomery, an official with the Navy. He didn't believe her story that she is a princess of a small European kingdom, but he turned her over to the US goverment for safe-keeping, thinking he was done. That was just the beginning of a temptous love-affair.If you're looking for a fun book to read this summer, this book would be it.6-20-05"
5,Reread,I ordered this book because I had read it years ago and wanted to visit it again. Ordering from Amazon is easy and you can find new or older books.
2,Reads like a bad B movie,"This man in the Army named Jarl T. Mongomery goes on leave to a deserted island(huh) Then Jarl meets a Princess whom Jarl helps escape a murder. Of course, he is stunningly handsome and she is stunningly beautiful. (No one is ever average in these books.) They get rescued and the army decides for some convulted reason I could not comprehend, to have them get married.They fight a lot, and hate each other. They have sex in weird uncomfortable positions and places. Believe it or not it gets even more unbelievable. You could spend the time reading this book, or just rent the r rated version of the musical South Pacific."
2,Honest Analysis Only Please....,"I am going to save you some time by letting you know you shouldn't buy this book. Let's let this one gracefully go out of print under the category called ""Jude Devreaux's Practice Makes Perfect Books"". It had huge potential, but failed in so many areas. Heroine was passive, hero was not forceful in an appealing break-through-your defenses way, but rather just plain offensive and obnoxious. I am not saying this coming from a women's lib perspective (and if I was, I wouldn't use this platform to pontificate upon), but this book was insulting.I am trying to be as honest and direct as possible on this one, and despite this review, I love Jude Devereaux."
3,Terrible ending; Too Chauvinist Hero,"Good story but I kept expecting it to get better. It never did. The hero was way too ""mean"" for way too long in the book--I don't care what his reasons were. And the ending? Absolutely terrible. After all that, just a quick ""I'm back now we'll be together?"" You've got to be kidding me? As another reviewer pointed out, there should have been declarations of love and more. What a disapointment."
2,"Worn 3x, falling apart","The elastic waist makes the jeans fit nicely and they look wonderful; however, I have only worn them three times and the waistband and zipper area are falling apart. As I went to unzip them, the zipper was stuck and I noticed some threads caught in the zipper. When I examined the area, I saw that not only were there loose threads/shredding in the zipper area, but the material around the button is literally shredding and falling apart and I will have to mend it so that the button at the waist doesn't fall off. I'm surprised because I thought Lee made high quality jeans that would last a long time."
4,Issue with some staples,"Mine works with the 1/4 staples great. I tried the 3/8 T50 and they jammed in the feeder (and a bit of a pain to remove). We've gone through almost 1,000 of the 1/4 inch without a jam or a problem. Our original purchase didn't have the instructions attached so we also purchased Stanley 1/2 staples that according to the box would work in this model. They don't, too long. It seems that if you stick to the Stanley brand staples and keep it under 3/8"" it will work great."
3,Sharp shooter,"i use it for 2 days and it broke.no way i can fix it,so it went to the dumpster.honestly,i've seen people working with this one for wears without any problem,so it my be my bad luck...I wouldn't buy it again."
1,Not what I expected.,"This product is definitely not a good first time philosophy purchase. Good thing my sister uses many of the philosophy products or I would never consider another purchase. The description is clever and if you really want that ""bee stung look"" go for it. The nude shade was beautiful but within a minute of applying the gloss my lips started to feel warm and burny. I thought ""Ok, how bad can it be...."" After two minutes I couldn't tolerate the so called tingling and had to wash the gloss off. Before I did, I went to a mirror to take a look and my lips were red like I ate raspberries. Not a look desired by an adult female, unless I was really eating raspberries. Needless to say since I really liked the color of the gloss and the fact of how much I paid for it, I was disappionted. Hopefully the Birthday Cake body wash/shampoo and the facial cleanser will be more satisfying."
3,Not as good as hoped,"I had purchased a kit I saw on TV a while back and have to say it was wonderful, can't remember the name of it unfortunately. This creates a tingle in the lips making them feel very soft but nothing to create the plump I was hoping for. I still use it daily and have for a year now but had to add some other lip gloss to the 1/2 empty tube to add color. Also found the tube leaked on my lab coat while in my pocket. :-("
3,"Not very good, it's ok...","I was expecting more from this video. Unfortunatelly earlier world championships are payed undeservedly less attention, than, for example, uninteresting 1990 championship. Very few repeats. Main attension is payed to scoring goals, not to showing other great moments of soccer. Because of short length everything is told and shown very briefly. In spite of all these weaknesses you can still enjoy the games, especially early championships competition, see a lot of beatiful moments and episods - I had not seen some of these soccer masterpieces before this video."
3,Good to be your first soccer video,"My subject says it all, this is a good video if this is the first one in your soccer video collection.It does have interesting action a la important matches,goals,saves,free kicks etc.The biggest flaw in the video is their undue coverage of the matches for the third and the fourth place.Countries dont even field all their first XI for these matches and none of them have been any classics.Instead,some real good matches were not covered like the 1970 semi-final between Italy and West Germany,voted one of the best matches in the world cup history.Also,you cant catch anything on the exploits of the 1982 Brazil team,Eusebio,Platini,Roberto Baggio."
1,2 OUNCES = GOOD FOR A BB GUN,"My limited research with Epoxy is that you need a heck of a lot more than 1/16"" cover for it to not break off. This kit comes with 2 ounces, which translates into just enough to finish off your kids Daisy BB gun. In short, there is not enough epoxy. You are paying literally $20 for q-tips and wood sticks and $7 for 2 ounces of epoxy which is just enough to fill as the package explains....a 1/16"" gap everywhere. Not enough bros!"
1,Bad glossary makes this otherwise fine edition useless,"Chapman's 1611 translation of Homer is probably the best that's been done into English, and this edition is well designed and printed. BUT Chapman can't be read without a glossary -- he invented literally hundreds of words and has special meanings for hundreds more. The academic num-nums that put this stupid Bollingen edition together gave absolutely no indication in 600 pages of text as to which words are defined in the glossary -- not a footnote, not an asterisk, nothing. Your choice is to look up virtually every one of the hundreds of thousands of words of text to see if it's in the glossary, or just to read blindly on knowing that you're probably missing 50 percent of the meaning of the text. Someone should have lost their job over this piece of university nonsense."
1,A perfect example of bearing false witness against ones neighbor.,"I am always amazed when someone of one faith purports to be an expert of another persons faith. And I am even more amazed when it is obvious that said person has not objectively studied the other faith at all. Most of the issues that Mr. White brings up have been asked and answered many, many times over the past 175 years. Also, the caricatures of LDS people that he portrays are insulting, and he has, without a doubt, born false witness against his neighbor (Exodus 20:16). If he were to apply his own methods of judgment that he uses against the LDS church against his own faith, he would find that it would not do well; no religion would. He should remember what the Savior said, ""Judge not, that ye be not judged"" (Matthew 7:1)."
1,Letters to James White From a REAL Mormon Elder,"James White's book will receive a thorough review of how a Mormon Elder REALLY would answer his issues he raises. We will have our review in the next FARMS Review of Books (1999), where two of us REALLY do respond to White, instead of White being able to take the lead in ALL the supposed discussions with a Mormon. His chicancery knows no bounds as he unfrocks his witlessness about Mormons. His materials on the Joseph Smith papyri and the facsimiles in the Book of Abraham are a horse laugh! I destroy his contentions in our review. Look for it. Kerry A. Shirts"
1,misleading... an emotional mousetrap,"Being a member of the ""Mormon"" church, I felt intrigued by the author's claims. His writing style was enveloping, but he simply lulls his readers into a sense of trust and comfort, later feeding them half-truths, biased conclusions, and absolute falsehoods. Anyone who reads the book should research the author's background and credentials first, then make an honest effort to prove or disprove at least the historical facts through outside resources. The book is an emotional mousetrap designed to maim the spirit of the average inquisitive christian. The FARMS review by Shirt should be studied with equal intensity and honesty."

3,very interesting,"every so often, you hear about a film, that you just want to see.and every so often, said film, has a cast of well known performers, the funny thing is, that most time, the film you want to see is nolonger available on a well known medium.APOLOGY is just that film. the cast was well known, the stroy line banal. but it just had to be seen."
3,Very bad sound problem,"We bought this TV with built in DVD specifically to have ""night at the movies"" on our patio with a number of neighbors. The sound when viewing TV is great, but when a DVD is playing it reduces to where you can't hear well at 100 % setting. I purchased an external speaker set, and result is same."
3,OK TV - Great for bedroom not as a home theather.,Pros -Good Picture and cheap.PIP is great.Cons -Sometimes turns off while switching inputs. I have a Harmony 880 and they do not play nice together.It does not save sound settings. If you use an AUX stereo you have to change the settings to external everytime you power up the TV.__________________________________If you are on a big time budget this is a great buy. If not I would look to spend more money and get more features.
2,wow... I paid for this.,I am disturbed that my university forces this on students when even the staff discusses its many and varied faults. This book is much better as a door stop.
4,this cd is a must,"i bought this cd when it first came out,it's one of my favorite, a must have for all you instrumental listeners."
4,BUY IT!!!,"I'VE GOT TWO WORDS FOR YOU - ""BUY IT""!!! IF YOU LIKE INSTRUMENTAL ROCK GUITAR (A LA VINNIE MOORE, JOE SATRIANI) YOUR GOING TO ENJOY THIS ONE! BEST SONG IS ""WARM SUMMER RAIN"" WITHOUT A DOUBT!"
5,Incredible,An amazing true story. Helps build your faith. Richard Wurmbrand's life shows what the Holy Spirit will do when you lay all that you have on the line. The pain and agony he endured was awesome. Truly a man on God. Very much worth viewing and sharing with others.
4,"Good shirt, good value. If in doubt, order the larger size.","This shirt looks good. The fabric is not flimsy; it feels substantial. It has a bit of dazzle finish, so it's not matte. Not many rash guards come cheaper. Only worn it a couple times, so I can't tell you how good the SPF/UPF is.One tip: If you're between sizes on the chart or near the top of the range, as I was, order the larger size. I didn't, and it's almost painfully tight in the arms."
2,Not good,"This is an extremely amateurish movie, even for a low-budget indie, but it's not the very worst I've ever seen, so I gave it two stars instead of just one. Sean Michael Lambrecht is nice to look at, and Jeff Dylan Graham is a pretty good actor, but Jerod Howard is either a terrible actor or a good actor playing the worst character ever written. Secondary players are okay at best. It badly needed an editor, and a writer, and a director who knows how to make movies. Great movies can be made for pennies (ever seenMala Noche?), but this isn't one of them. I made it through to the end, but I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Well Intentioned But Poorly Executed,"I bought the movie expecting something else, I guess, say a serious drama dealing with real life problems of gay men. But this film has little more to offer than cliched ideas (e.g., gays are the products of homes with dominant mothers and weak or absent fathers - an idea that has long been discredited) and actions that didn't seem to follow from any form of rational motivation. The actors were earnest amateurs at best and the budget was minimal but those are things I could accept if the writing had been better and if it had more accurately presented gay people. I would not recommend the film to anyone other than maybe students at a film school studying how not to make a movie."
5,Great book of fiction but it could really happen,"This book, At the Hands of a Child, is a great book for all adults. We live in our own world and never understand that an act of kindness can be used to destroy lives. The children who were used in this book never got to live a normal happy childhood. This book should be a wake-up call for many, especially ones working with young children. My only question is, What could have been done to not only save the children but also the life of Mr. Richards and his family? This would make a very educational and exciting movie."
3,I'm not disappointed,"I haven't rushed to play the CD over and over, but neither do I rush over to skip it; it does provide pleasant background music. The only tracks I find myself singing along to are (predictably) Grey in LA and Daughter."
2,"""inspired by"" was the thing I missed...","not my favorite CD, though a couple of songs a neat and interesting. I liked the film a lot. For some reason I didn't really read the title of this CD, and that it was ""inspired by"", and not only ""from"" the movie. Be sure to listen to the songs before you buy..."
1,This one sucks!,"I have been a fan of Louden way before 'Dead Skunk' came out. I have seen in in concert too many times to list. I also have enjoyed everything and I mean everything that he has put out. This one to me is bad, it just did not click, the only track that was ok and I mean just ok was 'Daughter'. This is the first bad review I have evey given Louden and I hope the last one.I thought the movie was great,so it is not that. Good Luck to the people that buy this one and I hope you enjoy the music I sure did not."
3,Good songs and not so good,"Well, I'll probably get blown up by his fans but overall, there are many songs I don't like. ""Grey in LA"" is a classic. I heard it at the end of the movie and absolutely LOVE it! ""Daughter"" also is a song that I loved. With this CD I tried listening to the other songs but don't like his style and arrangements, a little corny for me and seem to be accordian based vs. guitar based. When this CD comes on I generally listen to ""Grey in LA"" and ""Daughter"" and move on. there is one instrumental Ysplanti I believe but that is all. To each his own."
3,Dents,"The product in the can was superb. However, I had to toss away two cans that were received because the the tops popped and three other cans were severely dented and suspect."
5,Great Soup,"I am now officially addicted to this. Definitely not the stuff your mom made for you from a can when you were a kid. This has a REAL tomato taste! Too bad it's so expensive, but despite the price,I'll keep buying it. Crumble up some Saltines into this soup and you'll think you died and went to heaven! In fact, this is SO good, I just KNOW some business school grad in the organization is going to find a way to cut corners and screw it up. Buy a case now before they change it!"
3,Too sweet!,"I wish I paid attention to the nutrition label before I bought this soup. It tastes too sweet for a tomato soup and you realize why when you look at the sugar content. Actually, since I normally drink the whole can (technically two serving), I get the sugar equivalent of a regular soft drink each time.Other than that, taste is fine and being organic is a plus. This might be a 4-5 star soup for somebody who likes sweet soup and doesn't care for extra sugar intake."
2,Splenda,Sorry but I just did not care for the taste of this product. I went back to my favorite artificial sweetener.
1,Not a wise alternative to sugar,"Contrary to popular belief, sucralose is not a healthy alternative to sugar, and instead, like other artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, actually has been shown to cause significant negative health effects.James Turner, the chairman of the national consumer education group Citizens for Health, has expressed shock and outrage after reading a new report from scientists outlining the dangers of the artificial sweetener Splenda (sucralose).In animals examined for the study, Splenda reduced the amount of good bacteria in the intestines by 50 percent, increased the pH level in the intestines, contributed to increases in body weight and affected P-glycoprotein (P-gp) levels in such a way that crucial health-related drugs could be rejected."
4,My parents love it,I got this for my parents as they are diabetic. The seem to like but I prefer real sugar. It is good in what it is.
4,"A good sweetener, but...","...we just found out that Splenda, which is the only sweetener we have used for years, also has some problems of concerning its product makeup, which is not as good as we had believed."
5,Splendid buy,If you one whose doctor change you from sugar to splenda you must take advantage of this 700-count box offered. Saves shipping. Saves Taxes. Helps keep you on track.
2,Splendq pricy for the content,"As much as I like buying from Amazon, I found this and some others to be extremely priced. $15 for 7000 packets is a lot. I found 1000 packets for only 13.99 at clubs and supermarket."
1,Poison,"I did some reading up on Splenda as well as other sweeteners, but splenda has chlorine in it. It is slow Poison!!!!!"
1,This isn't sugar and it's not good for you,"Sugar isn't good for you either, but Spenda is REALLY not good for you, it's not even a food! When I found this out I actually called them and told them I was irritated and that I felt misled. I gave away my Splenda and haven't touched it since I found out about it."
3,it is small and it leaks -- a VERY bad value,"Bought this because I was out of Splenda and out of time - a crazy schedule. This is NOT a large box like at Costco - more like two of the ones from Walmart. Although it was packets, it was FULL of splenda POWDER which leaked all over everything (floor, counters, etc) before I even got the wrapping off the box. There were no cuts in the box - so the leak was not caused by a mistake by the delivery person. It is simply inferior product from the manufacturer. So, I'm so busy I order this online, yet noe I have to scrub up all this mess off of everything. Go to Costco, get more for much less. And it won't leak all over the place, either."
5,Love the packets as they are portable,I love the packets of Splenda as they are portable and easy to use. In the morning I use a couple packets in my tea and on my cereal. No spoons to dirty as you can open up a packet and sprinkle on the Splenda.I also like to tuck a few packets in my purse for when I am dining out as Splenda is the best tasting when it comes to sugar substitutes.What I like most about Splenda is how it tastes much like sugar. You can use it in cooking or baking as Splenda does not turn bitter when heat is used.Recommend.
4,Great stuff,"Supposedly this is the safest artificial sweetener and it tastes fine too. Favorite uses: coffee, tea, and hot cereals such as oat bran and unsweetened oatmeal. I ordered two of these gegunda boxes and am grateful for the opportunity to save so much money vs. supermarket prices. Unfortunately, there was a terrible delay: I ordered on Feb 2 and didn't receive until March 20. Otherwise, no complaints and I'm fixed for sweetener for a good year!"
1,Caused Insomnia in my husband and myself,"Splenda causes insomnia in my husband and me. This effect is reproducible: have Splenda, sleep poorly. If you have intermittent insomnia, look at your diet."
5,THE **PERFECT** Sweetner,"Of all sweeteners I've used, even sugar!Splenda is the BEST...* No after taste* No Calories* Dissolves easilyWhat else could anyone ask for! :)"
5,Good Sugar-replacement product,Splenda has been recommended to us by our family doctor. It's a good sugar-replacement because it's from natural source and it doesn't have aspartame.
5,Awesome product and easy way to keep up,Hi I see so many reviews on Splenda that I thought I would put in my 2 cents. I am a Splenda addict if I do not have Splenda I will use regular sugar. I am a border line Diabetic and control my sugars this way. I have gotten to the point that i supply several members in my family and a couple at work because they cannot get it as cheap as I do. It takes the place of sugar without the aftertaste. If you need to watch you sugars I can also recommend the splenda Brown Sugar (Works great with Sweet Potatoes).The subscribe and save is the best way to go with the auto deliveries
2,Bad reception,I bought this item for my husband. We have 2 kids and are out of the house alot. He likes to watch the games on TV while we are out at our kids activities. And this portable TV said you get VHF and UHF tuner. Well you do get the channels but the reception is so bad it is not even worth it. I am returning the item this week as a mmatter of fact. Nice looking little TV very bad recpetion did not work for what we wanted it to.
1,"No Paris, you are not Madonna, and you never will be!","This entire album sounds like Paris was listening to a couple of Madonna records, and decided that she would buy some talent (technology) and become Madonna. yeah Right!This entire album is a sad sad excuse for music, and Paris only comes across as even more repulsive (if that were possible). She is NOT sexy, nor is she overly attractive, and purring over 12 tracks is not going to change that."
1,My ears retracted into my head,"Ok this album sux. This is the epitome of wasted beats and a total waste of time for whatever producer decided to work on this album. Paris hilton doesn't have any talent in her body whatsoever. I would say that she would be a good porn star but I saw her video that got released and she has no talent in that area either. Even though she has an abundant amount of money, I still recommend the nearest Target register as her career of choice. Fat Joe and Jadakiss should play russian roulette with each other for being on this album. Avoid this album like the bubonic plague!!!!!!"
1,horrible,"I can't belive people are giving this CD good reveiws. I wish I could give it 0 stars, it derseves as much. The only song that would be good if Paris could sing is The Stars Are Blind. I almost found myself liking it, before she hit a wrong note! Paris can't sing!!!!!!!!!! and the CD SUCKS! she should go back to being a stupid party girl, and quit giving pop a bad name!!!!!!!"
1,"miss-independant THIS ONE""S FOR YOU!!!!","This review is in every way dedicated to the reviewer miss-independant. If your are also p***** off with this clown than vote for me. God, what is wrong with you. Your a disgrace to America, calling this a 5 star record. Your truly an ignorant little b****. Stop bagging on all the haters, we all know that you fans are dumb as Hell. You have no taste in music, look Paris Hilton can't sing. Your only addicted to this cause of the 5 star production, that she bought. Your wack. Yeah you might hate this review and this review hates you!!!"
1,horrendous.period,"seriously, its so bad it makes me weep for those who actually like it.you want good music? try:andrea bocellikeanechristina aguilerapizzicato five (j'adore!)rilo kileythe donnasand a lot more, but not this hilton! sorry, but eugh!"
1,What kind of world do YOU want to live in?,"There are millions of songs out there, hundreds of thousands of musicians working hard everyday on their craft, working to make the sounds in their souls come to fruition through audible music, this person is not one of them. She is an heiress and has never had to work a day in her life, it has all been handed to her on a silver platter and yet we are buying her CD? What for, to promote this selfish behaivior, to promote these values and ideals? What kind of kids do you want, what kind of a people are we?"
4,I like it!,"I can see the Haters are out in full force, but that does not change the fact that Paris Hilton's album is pretty good. Actually, the only song I did not care much for is ""Jealousy"" but all the other stuff is good. I think this album will continue to sell at a steady pace, despite attempts by the anti-Paris clique to diss it. But these people are just losers,trying to bring a winner like Paris down to their miserable level. Yes, Paris Hilton is beautiful, naturally thin, and has a loving, wealthy family. DEAL WITH IT!"
3,Decent...,Ok Album. Best Songs Are Nothing In This World & Do Ya Think I'm Sexy. Other Song Are Ok But Not Worth Mentioning. Album Cover:3/10. Album Artwork: 6/10. Songs: 8/10.
1,Well...,"Although it sounds extremely bad, we now can all admit it is better than Scarlett Johanssen's horrible CD... :) It truly proves that everything is relative."
1,Paris Hilton ---- God help us all!!!!!,"(I am not below 13, just couldn't be bothered to sign up)Words used to describe this album: Superficial, cringe-worthy, frothy-cum-unnatural, sleazy, insipid, with sugar-coated tracks masquerading as ""feel-good music"". Man, do I feel like throwing up at the thought of how SOME people could even THINK this album is any ""good"". We get enough of this kind of ""music"" from pop-puppets like Britney, Jessica Simpson and the PussyCat Dolls. Not surprisingly, Paris Hilton seems to be in cahoots with these fellow ""music""-producers.Why is she even famous in the first place? Her talent? Her skills? Her intellect? Her ""beauty""? Her hardwork? Her contribution to something worth being aware of? Is she a prodigy? What do you think the answer is?"
4,I think it's very entertaining,It's upbeat. It's got great beats. Very good production. Paris is not the best vocalist in the world but she's better than Britney Spears and her music is not boring like Jessica's. Christina is probably going to get a bunch of Grammies and deservedly so but her album is more Starbucks music than fun pop.I admit that my expectations were very low (I was expecting the female William Hung). Probably nobody will be listening to this CD in a few months. It's not the pop of the decade or even close. But how many times can you listen to Kelly Clarkson?
3,I CAN'T STOP LAUGHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOLLISTEN TO ""FIGHTEN OVER ME"" LOL ALL THE GUYS ARE FIGHTING OVER ME!!!Haha, that's the funniest songs ever, and so is ""Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?"" LOL! All she talks about is how hot she is, Haha.I gave it 2 extra stars for the laugh.LOL.Look at the tags.[...]"
4,Suprisingly not Bad,"Yeah, I thought what everyone else thought, paris' album is sure to suck and be a joke. But with her collaboration with scott storch her album is actually good, not great, but good.Worth Listening to: Turn It Up, Nothing In This World, Jealousy, Screwed, Fightin' Over Me"
3,"Not Bad, Not Bad at all....","Hey, you should give this a shot. It sounds like regular pop stuff to me."
3,Don't Hate...Congratulate!,"Ok, I know it's Paris Hilton. But the CD isn't half bad. It has a Britney type vibe. And guess what? It's way better than Jessica Simpson's debacle of a CD. I was surprised at how good it is, considering!"
5,Was shocked to find out it was Paris,"My wife played the entire CD twice on our drive from LA to Vegas yesterday. Only upon arrival did I find out we were listening to Paris Hilton?!? I was shocked! Not bad, especially coming from someone that doesn't listen to that type of music. She's got some pretty catchy stuff. I recommend it."
5,I love Paris in the summer time!,"This is a great summer album.I love all the songs.All of them are very danceable.Paris really and finnally did it! come out with an album which i thought would never happen but it did.Paris is very smart..she's in everything,music,tv,perfume and more..she's a great business woman.She was very smart for hooking up with Scott he's one of the best producers today and i love what they did with the album.And i love how she has rappers Fat Joe and Jadakiss on the album for the song ""Fighting over me"" which is one of my favorite tracks.I was happy to see that paris did an 80's retro ballad ""heartbeat"".this song i think should be the next single.Now i'm wondering what Nicole Richie's album would sound like :-)"
5,I love Paris!!!,"Many people don't like Paris Hilton, but her CD is great with fantasticmusic, and with the aid of backup and echo chambers, her songs are fine, and good. She really made a great CD, and I think ""Paris"" is the best of all of them, and she also sings ""The Stars are Blind"", which is a cool song. Thanks Paris for an entertaining CD!!!"
4,Don't listen to the critics,"Its so easy to dismiss everyones favorite target as just another no talent, wannabee. And I am not saying Paris has any great talent. But this album is better than most of the current crop of female ""music stars"".None of them can really sing, but at least Paris's album has good songs on it. ""Nothing in this world"" ""Stars are Blind"" are good songs, even Meatloaf couldn't make them make sound bad'.And how do you pass up an album with Paris Hilton singing ""Do you think I'm sexy""Yes she's overexposed, overly rich, overly dumb and certainly full of herself, but if you think any of the current crop of female stars are any different, your fooling yourself, at least this album has more than 2 good songs on it."
1,Worst album I've heard all year,"Paris Hilton's CD is less of a record than a digital creation. She may have hired big-time producers, but even they can't make Paris sound good. And I felt that the producers wasted any little bit of pop potential that these songs had, as the record sounds fake and joyless. But then, Paris's whole attempt at an album was egotistical. Paris still gets most of the blame here. Her version of ""Do Ya Think I'm Sexy"" must be one of the worst covers ever. While I'm not a Britney Spears fan, she does have some fun guilty pleasures. No such luck here."
3,"FOR THE RECORD, SHE STILL REPULSES ME","I REALLY dislike Paris Hilton. I REALLY didn't want to like ""Stars are Blind"". Curiosity got the better of me and I gave it a listen and found that I didn't hate it. Then I heard it again and thought, yeah it's kind of catchy. THen I checked out the rest of the album on Napster. You know how they let you play full length tracks for free. And dammit if I didn't hate those songs too. Turn It Up, I Want You (with it's Grease sample), Screwed, and Not Leaving Without You all sound pretty good to me. It's stupid pop music that is just mindless fun. Listen to it while you work out, or clean or something. Yeah, I still think Paris is a vapid, shallow, idiot. (And a ho!) But this is not a bad album. I'll just pretend it's someone else as I am listening to it."
3,Fun album!,"I thought that Paris Hilton made a good fun album. Why it was ignored afterwards is beyond me. I liked Stars are Blind, but the meat of this album is the 7 songs that Scott Storch produced. Storch's rumbling beats match well with Paris' somewhat average singing. Vocally she needs to improve if she wants to tackle music full time. I also like I Want You and its nifty sampling of Grease in its song. This album made me forget about her tabloid articles. Nothing in the World sounds very Kelly Clarkson-like, yet Paris pulls it off quite well. And several numbers match well with her sexy image. The Rod Stewart remake of Rod's much maligned, yet fun disco hit Do Ya Think I'm Sexy is funky and sassy. I hope that Paris releases another album to show the more real side of her."
3,"Perfect If You Like Hillary Duff Or Britney Spears, Sucks If You Like Goldfrapp Or Metric",This isn't half bad really. Not exactly my taste but I definently expected worse. If you're a fan of this type of music you'll probably like it. I could care less about Paris' life so I'm not rating her life. I'm rating her music. And it's not that bad. Give it a try.
1,Yeesh.,"The fact that Paris Hilton, of all people, has a record deal, is truly astonishing. I continue to believe that the music industry is going down the tubes, making it's way to the bottom. She's milking her celebrity status for all it's worth, albeit the fact that she hasn't and continues to do NOTHING to keep herself famous.Talent? She completely lacks it, like many other musicians today. The most intelligent quote that's ever fallen out of her mouth was her 15 minute catch phrase, ""That's Hot!"". Think about that when you decide to check out her album."
5,AWESOME,Paris Hilton ROCKS!..She's awesome...move over Mariah and Toni..Paris is taking your place!!!....I'm sure that comment will stir some controversy!
1,Don't Bother,The worst thing about this CD is that it took forever to end. I can say 3 good things about this CD:1. It was very cheap2. The song Nothing In This World is pretty good!3. The absolute best thing about this CD is that it does finally end!
4,"Oh, Paris!","Paris Hilton, a self-exploitation genius, a unique pop culture phenomenon, and the easiest target in the world to slam, I have to hand it to you...although it's entirely due to the producers, you've really come out with something fun. Upon first listen I was disappointed with my impulse buy; I put it away for a week. When I pulled it out again, I gave a few songs more of a listen: Nothing in this World, Screwed, and Not Leaving Without You, and to be honest, they have a lot of replay value, are catchy and fun, as well as a little predictable. Paris' voice, although certainly nothing to write home about, is seemingly pure, precise and feminine. At times she has a little bit of a Britney vibe. I think I'm going to enjoy this more than I thought...give it a listen - and give yourself over to PARIS!"
1,why did paris make a cd,"well she did it again crappy reality shows, drugs, sex tapews, wild parties, lesbianism can't forbget that now she wants to sing and dip into hip hop well sorry paris I hate your music and this is another example that money can get you everything miss the old days when you hade to have talent to get by now any fool can sing or rap that'as why we download."
1,(I turn on the radio) .....who did he say this was singing?,HAAAAAAAAAAAAA HAHAAA (knee slap) AAAAHAHAHA (fall out of my chair) HAAA (Gasp for air) HAAAAAAAAAAAA.........
5,Great,"You don't need to take music appreciation courses to determine what is good music or bad, just listen. Don't plug your ears because the media tells you not to like Paris Hilton. If you like pop or dance music, you will like this album. The vocals are mild and pleasant while the songs are catchy without being infectiously sugary.The lyrics are honest and don't reach for the range of emotions just to have them on the album. I listen to this CD often and my friends totally love it (though I didn't tell them who it was)."
4,"Parita Hilton ""Little Paris""","That's IF the singers on this CD are really Paris Hilton, she did an amazing job on her Cd. This is way beyond karaoke action, and if it's really Paris Hilton, she is way better than any American Idol reject. For the genre (Britney Spears etc...) Her vocals are surprisingly good. Going out on a limb, she is definately not tone def and can probably even do country if she lives in the south for awhile or dates a cowboy if he could put up with her crap. My fave song is ""Heartbeat"", and the remake of ""Do U Think I'm Sexy"" I kool 2. I think Paris could do a follow up to this if she could keep out of jail. Go Gurl."
4,Better than I expected,"I was kind of hesitant about buying this album. I couldn't decide between Christina Aguilera double CD or Paris. Well, I made a good choice by getting Paris's CD. People out there should cut the girl some slack. She can really sing and this album proves it. I love most of the songs. They have that party girl vibe (just like her). I definitely recommend this album. She might not be as good as Christina but she does a great job."
1,not worth your time,"i bought this at the dollar tree for .50 cents thats how bad it is, do yourself a favor and just download turn it up and i want you on limewire if you like those songs enough to want to buy the whole cd you are either A. a retard, or B. have no taste in music two listenable songs thats it"
1,THE PERFECT LAXATIVE!,"Ladies and Gents, if you're suffering from horrendous constipation, this trashy CD is the perfect remedy for your monstrous cramps! Just one listen, and you'll be bursting thru that bathroom door like there will be no tomorrow! Better than Ex-Lax! Highly recommended for senior citizens."
1,oh..........my............*,"absolutely unreal peoples! All these five star reviews, man did all these people smoke the same pipe? Was Cheech there? Chong?Yeah lets write a five star music review on the worst female singer since Ricci Lake, c'mon give me a break! The cover is great for men who want to look at that. Beyond that it is a waste of money for the music!With the cover who cares, she is all over the internet, so sad! Absolutely nothing to listen to here unless you want to dumb yourself down, I suppose if you listened to this while watching Michael Moore try to talk his way out of a parking ticket it just might put a person into a coma!"
1,Horrible,"This album is the worst album I've ever heard. The songs have no good beats and her voice is gross. And she didn't get a record deal, she started her own because no record label in their right mind would give her a record deal. This album will probably flop."
1,I probably couldn't do any better,but that's still no excuse.Her appeal is as dead as Snakes On A Plane.Ok what's next?
3,Lots of good things,"I liked this product for the following reasons:a) The heavily retouched cover photo of Paris fits neatly on my dartboard.b) The disc itself makes a perfectly serviceable mug mat.c) You can recycle/reuse the jewel outer case.d) Not owning a cd player, I do not have to concern myself with her pitiful songs."
3,Looking at the accident,"If you're reading this, let me say this....... You shouldn't be mad at Paris. Instead look in the mirror and point the finger at yourself. You're the butthead that took time out of your life to actually listen to this CD. But cut yourself a break.... I Understand! You just needed to see for yourself.You know when you're in a traffic jam because there is an accident up ahead. You're mad as hell because the cars ahead of you slow down to look at the collision and once your get near the accident you can't help but to look yourself. This is Paris's album. C'mon.... where you really expecting something great? Oh you were. Shame on you!I gave this album 3 stars because it wasn't that bad for what it was worth. I heard worst and honestly expecting worst. This is definitely a studio album. DO NOT BUY! DOWNLOAD DOWNLOAD DOWNLOAD"
1,Money can buy you almost anything,"I guess when you are a mega rich heiress, money can buy you looks and a CD...but one thing it cannot buy you is genuine talent....something that this Poptart Princess is severely lacking. Her voice is as flat as her chest. What a waste of money and time spent on this CD. It doesn't even deserve a 1 star rating, but it's the lowest it will let me choose. Live and Learn."
4,"Good, mindless fun","Yes, she is shallow. True, she only made an album 'cause she could pay for it. And duh, she can't sing. But does this make Paris Hilton's self-titled effort bad? Not at all.Do we actually care if the artist can sing and whether the lyrics are meaningful? Of course not. Take Britney, for example. In the world of pop music, shallowness is something that's counted on, if not mandatory. And who better than our favorite heiress? The beats are club-friendly, and with all that money she has, you bet it's gonna be greatly produced! Starting off with the club-friendly ""Turn It Up"" and a hip-hop influenced ""Fighting Over Me"", ""Paris"" is never dull. Sure, there are some lesser moments, like the slower ""Jealousy"" and ""Heartbeat"", but she manages to drop some killer hits, like the reggae-sounding ""Stars Are Blind"", generic-yet-cute ""Nothing In This World"" and the pop-rock wannabe, ""Screwed"". Britney never had this much fun."
4,"Like a Paris ( city ) always catchy,....and forgettable","i like city of Paris , same as I like Paris ( Hilton ) . In this album , she tried ( quite hard i think ) to show us , how is Paris' music ; catchy, soft, easy listening, and make your footstep lightly . For people who loves Paris, it's a must thing , because you won't regret...for people who hate her, as long as you have more money than you need , you could try to listen this album.........i imagine to listen this in Paris City with the singer......"
5,Paris by Paris Hilton review,"Her style and personality really shines through on this CD! Can't argue... ""Stars are Blind"" and ""Nothing In This World"" were very good!Can't find a bad song on the album! Good Listening! Waiting for her next release, heard some samples and they sound very catchy!Paris Hilton News and Reviews on YouTube.Paris by Paris Hilton review."
1,You bought this?,"I heard the song that was on the radio. Yeah I guess I'm not hip and trendy, but you use those words like people always have. Those are 90's slang! Those words were made to describe themselves! Their meaningless, just like the music on this CD. Paris. Please. Make some more porn, you sold more."
1,that's hot....NOT!,"this music is throwaway bubblegum pop that was handed to paris hilton just so she can once again pollute the media with her trash and freakshow headlines every other week that are beyond stupid. She can't sing, nor could she act or dance or model or anything. She's only good at exposing herself on camera and should have just gotten into the adult entertainment industry."
1,Having Money Doesn't Make You A Singer,"Remember When Music Was Something That Meant Something, Not Just Another Toy For Some Deb-U-Tart. When I First Heard This I Thought It Was A Joke, Well It Wasn't A Joke But A Feeble Attempt For Even More Attention She Doesn't Deserve. She Claims To Have Have Written Material On This CD, I Just Don't See How She Found The Time To Pry Herself From Shopping And Just Being Paris. Maybe Nicole Has The Has The Right Idea And Just Stay Away From Paris."
1,Are you kidding?,"The people giving this CRAP anything more that -5 stars (that's a negative 5) are Horny old men buying those blue pills online. Are you kidding?PS... Paris is in jail as of June 8, 2007. She'll make WONDERFUL music with Matilda, the ward bully. Enjoy your stay Paris!"
1,she was better off a porn star,"like Jes, she got a nice hot photo for the cover making every guy want to check out the cd! However, what ur listening to is anything but good. it's like Britney fabrication all over again. her voice is anything but miraculous, the songs are dull and for the most part, stupid. there's absolutely no originality but considering it's Paris, I wasn't really looking for that but it should be at least entertaining or catchy but it's just a lame attempt for her to say, ""hey, I'm a musician too."" haha, yah right. all her fame was from her father, she has hardly any talent & I'm begging her to stop singing. it's just painful."
1,The worst of all time,"This is the worst CD of all time! It's just horrible, Paris Hilton voice stinks period! The songs stink! The production stinks! It all stinks! Whats sad is this CD actually sold thousands of copies because it features a famous person. Blah! Who cares! If you want to buy a good CD from :gimmick artists"" but Tatu-Dangerous & Moving which features two teenagers who were supposedly lesbians. That CD is actually good, they are pretty good singers, and the songs are greatly written, and the production is awesome! But not even the great Trevor Horn could do anything with a talentless Paris Hilton! F-"
3,This album is no masterpiece....,"However, this album is not awful either. It's definitely in the average category. Paris does not have the greatest singest voice in the world. At times, she sounds a tad bit off-key. However, the songs on this CD are catchy and fun to listen to. Her lyrics are not as sexually explicit as many of the mainstream hip-hop/pop artists that are out there today. Her tunes do have some great beats and they are definitely fun to listen to. If you are thinking of buying this album and have $14 just lying around, order it. However, if you are looking for some great vocals and some awesome song-writing, skip this album and pick a more qualified singer/songwriter."
1,Haven't I heard this before!! Horrible attempt for an hotel heiress.,"In regards of an attempt to become a rock artist, her lack of musician skills show here in this album. Most of the songs on this album sound the same, many of them are about herself in a very egotistical way. And did I mention all about sex.... wait..... WANTING sex with Paris, even girls too.Most of the songs have her moaning and almost whinning (lack of breath support as a singer). It is sad to see the recording industry going as low as this, hotel heiress gets an album only because of her name.Save your money on something worthwhile.Im bored now after listening to the album."
1,Terrible,"Come on now this cd is a hot mess. It shows that if u have money u can be anything u want to be. You cant even hardly hear her singing the beat over shadows her terrible voice. If I could I would not even give her a star. Anybody that says this cd is hot is crazy. Just because she is ur hero which I dont understand why, you dont have to pump up her cd."
1,How shallow are you?,Ask yourself what kind of a person are you? Are you going to buy this garbage and align yourself with one of the medias most untalented socialites. Paris Hilton famous for absolutely nothing. Are you going to give this walking disaster your hard earned money? Think about it before you waste your time and money on this piece of junk. Don't send her a message that she can just buy her way into any industry and all of a sudden earn the record sales that it takes other artists years to earn. As any good socialite she did the bare minimum and hopefully you won't just swallow it and call it candy.
1,OMG! That sounds Horrible,OK! I'm not blaming the song writer or the person who mixed the sounds. I'm blaming Paris. What the hell where you thinking? This sounds horrible. I'm sorry Paris but stick to what you do best. Overall the sounds sounded great and I give props to everyone who worked on the album. It's just that I feel like i'm hearing some doing karaoke and it just doesn't sounded like a professional singer is singing. It doesn't have that fire. sorry but 2 thumbs down.
1,I just threw up a little in my mouth,"I do not own this CD nor would I ever, EVER waste my money on this trash. In fact, I just wasted three minutes of my life (now four after typing this) listing to the clips posted by amazon.SHE IS TERRIBLE. She is soo terrible that its funny. People fightin' all over me? That song is awful. This CD is awful and you need serious mental help if you actaully paid money for this - God bless you if you did - because you need all the help you can get."
2,For the true fans only,"I give it **1/2 stars It was a good attemptThis album is exactly what I expected from her. I never thought she was that great of a singer or song writer and that is what you get on the cd. If you are a fan of hers then you are going to like it. It is full of her talking about how sexy she is and how sexy everybody thinks she is. You are also going to hear some songs about going out to party and boys. That is pretty much all it is. I would not recommend this cd to anyone who is a true music lover because you are not going to get your money's worth. What I do recommend to anyone who is curious is to go to AOL and hear it for free like I did.Screwed, Jealous, and Stars are Blind are pretty the much the only songs that make the album worth listening to."
2,I can not believe the great revies this CD got...so I'm writing my own!,"I'm not a huge fan of Paris Hilton, but I don't hate her either, so when I heard she was coming out with a record I was curious. The CD starts out with the song Turn It Up, which is actually an OK song. It starts off with a nice beat and the song itself reminded me of Britney Spear's album In The Zone. Fightin' Over Me follows and the fact that I actually laughed should have been a cue for me to turn it off and not waste my time listening to the rest of the CD, but since Stars Are Blind, which I like, was next I gave it the benefit of the doubt... I shouldn't have! The rest of the CD goes on about how hot she is and how jealous (*hmm* Nicole Richie) people are of her. I gave this CD 2 stars because I do like 2 tracks out of the 14, but do yourself a favor and don't waste your money. This girl can not sing and her album pretty much sucks...sorry Paris, stick to your day job."
5,Best female singer I've ever heard.,"This album is great. Paris Hilton is great. Paris Hilton is hot. The only reason others do NOT like this album is because they hate Paris Hilton. Track 5 (Jealousy) would perfectly describe everyone who rated this album with less than 5 stars. Not only is this album great, but her music videos are even greater.PARIS: ""If you like my body, and you think I'm sexy, come on sugar let me know.""MARIOBRUCEFOX: ""Yes, Yes, oh God yes."""
4,Suprisingly good,This is a good album. The songs are lively and perfect for someone thrown in the limelight only because she was rich. This disc can spin beginning to end without skipping. Only reason I didn't give a 5 star is because it is well under an hour. Bravo Paris! You did well.
1,Not for the long run,"After less than 2 years, it started having problems, Like it takes over 10 minutes before it shows anything. Called customer support for warranty, and was told unless it really doesn't show anything at all, then it is normal because it is more than a year old according to them.I have 2 other Samsung flat screens that are more than 3 years old and still works without a problem."
4,Creative problem solving techniques and examples,"The Creative Thinking CDROM teaches what I would call ""creative problem solving in a structured way"". Their concept, Advanced Systematic Inventive Thinking (ASIT), describes a few specific new ways at looking at problems to identify solutions. Lots of good examples. It does not, however, address creativity in an artistic sense. The enclosed book and introductory lessons are very illustrative, although the two repeat essentially the same information. There are 12 ""games"" (situational puzzles/problems) to solve. Although this is billed as the professional edition the selection of problems and use of cartoons makes this suitable for older children (teenagers). Humor is used to urge you to try again when you do not get the problems right. The problems are somewhat challenging, the solutions are not obvious. Consider this an investment to add some new ""tools to your toolbox"" for the next time a problem stumps you."
1,GET REAL,"I also was expecting a box with something in it. Silly me! Sooooo disappointed; I thought it would be stocked with a selection of useful remedies: for colds, nausea, insomnia, stress, headache. The biggies. I remember getting a wonderful kit from Boiron for my infant daughter many years ago that had just such a selection. Maybe it's naive to expect a quantity of remedies for $19, but it's reprehensible to charge $19 for an empty plastic box. This is not a ""kit""; it's a misleading rip off."
3,Misleading title,"The title of this item is misleading. Calling something a ""kit"" implies that it includes more than just a storage case. If they insist on calling it a kit it should be called ""My Home Kit Storage Container"" for clarity purposes. It doesn't actually become a Home Kit until you get it and fill it up with your own remedies."
2,Not What I Expected,"Although the quality of this plastic kit is quite good, I understood the description to mean that an assortment of homeopathic preparations was included so was very disappointed to find I had purchased only the storage unit. I think the description could be written more clearly."
3,Not what I thought,This item wasn't what I thought it was. I really thought it would have samples in it and was not just a storage case. I am new to homeopathy and guess I just misread what it was saying. I guess my biggest disappointment is that I don't have NEARLY enough tubes to fill the container nor do I think I will ever.
4,If you love PWEI then just buy it!,First time i heard of PWEI was back around '88.Always a great mix of music. Original.I had to add this to my collection.Long time fan.
5,an original comus fan,"I am amazed to find out that First Utterance is available on CD. In 1971 / 1972 I was a devoted Comus fan and saw them about three or four times around Ealing and West London. I remember seeing them at Ealing Town Hall and apart from me and my boyfriend there were only a handful of other people. For years I have lamented the fact that I no longer had the LP not realising that it had been re-issued on CD.I could never understand why they did not make a bigger impact and seemed to vanish, so to read that there are still people around over 30 years later who really appreciate their music is wonderful.Susanna"
3,"Good to kill time, but that's it","Any weathered Texas Hold 'Em player won't find much realism here in this GBA title from Majesco. The computer players will stay in with any hand, which means if your looking to play this to practice your poker skills, you'll find just how unrealistic this is. The fact that Texas Hold 'Em is so cheap in price makes it worth purchasing for GBA owners who enjoy the card game, as it is a good time killer. However, playing this GBA game for extended periods of time will show just how shoddy a job was done designing this game. The graphics are simplistic but colorful and they suit the game, while the sound is simplisticly done as well. The control scheme is easy to get a hold of as well, making the game easy to get into. Despite it's good qualities though, Texas Hold 'Em for the GBA fails to evoke the same kind of fun and strategic qualities that the card game gives you, but if you want a good and cheap time killer for your GBA, look no further."
2,Merely average and way too easy,"I'd give Texas Hold 'Em a little higher of a score than one star, but I have to agree with what the previous reviewer said about the game's computer-controlled players. If you go ""All In"", most of the other players will too... regardless of what they have in their hand. I beat the Atlantic City scenario (4th out of 5) in less than 15 minutes thanks to a few well-timed All In bets.Graphically, don't expect much. There are no player faces... just the cards on a table. The interface is easy to use as well. As far as the sound goes, the ""announcer"" is a neat touch- the first time you play through. After a while, hearing ""The Flop Is..."", ""The Turn Is..."", ""The River Is..."" gets old quickly!If you're looking for a bargain-priced poker game for GBA, this is pretty much your only option. It is a fun game, but die-hard poker fans will definitely consider looking elsewhere for a better challenge."
1,Save your money,"I was eagerly anticipating a good poker game for the Game Boy Advance. After playing this game, I'm still waiting for one.You have two types of Texas Hold 'Em Poker available in this game--limit poker cash games and a no-limit tournament version. There are zero no limit cash games or limit tournaments. The tournament isn't much of a tournament. If you win 5 consecutive tables, the tournament's done. There are no higher levels for better players.The computer players in this game are horrible. First, any time I went all in with a legit hand, almost every computer player called. You will never see 8 people at a table go all in unless all eight have very good hole cards. Also, the computer always went all in when it had two pair but it would never bet with a straight or a flush, even if it was the nuts (the best hand possible).Another downfall is that the game uses very long passwords, between 16 and 20 characters long.The low price might be tempting. However, you get what you pay for."
2,Great time killer,"This game is only difficult if you've never played Texas Hold'em.Other than that it's nothing but a time killer. It's hard to be competitive when the computer never folds before the pre flop, regardless what is in their hands. The computer will call you about 85% of the time regardless if their hand is good or bad. Any good hold'em player will fold more hands than they actually play but this isn't the case with the computer. It rarely folds. I've also seen at times when the computer has a great hand instead of raising, they will constantly check. Other times they will raise an absurd amount with only two pair. The game is a good buy for $10, what more can you ask for?"
2,Got a spare 10 minutes?,"If you do and you know your way around a Hold 'Em table you can chew them up with this game. Looking for anything more? Look elsewhere.Game play is simple and brainless. The cardplay from the game appears to have been programmed by chimpanzees. The rest of the programming isn't much better. This the first GBA game I've played that shows small video flaws occasionally during the game. It also suffers from something I thought was gone a lonnnng time ago - passwords to track career progress??? I'm sorry - are we suddenly back in 1993? How about throwing a couple of extra kilobytes of memory on the cartridge and save the progress onboard?Anyway - it's not like the game costs a small fortune or anything. Play it to pass the time but do NOT under ANY circumstances use this as a way to learn Hold 'Em. Unless, of course, you're playing at a table with me."
2,Disappointing - unrealistic play,"The graphics on the game are good, and as a basic poker game it passes, but if you're looking to practice your skills with this game, it disappoints. All of the computer players stay in with basically any hand, regardless of the level of play. I've been beaten by too many Two-Eight off suits to mention."
5,Great Game,Great game and he loves it. I need him to stay busy when I have other things I need to do
1,Bad if serious about poker,This game will actually make your poker play worse. If you are at all serious about poker don't buy this.
1,Save your money...,"Goodness gracious! My expectations were extremely low when I purchased this game, but still it managed to disappoint me. The play is NOTHING like the real thing. You can go all in, and still every player will call you, every time. The interface is uninspiring, with little to enjoy. Do not recommend this game at any price."
4,The folly of predicting,"74 American leaders and activists were asked, on the occasion of the Columbian Exposition of 1893, to envision the world of one hundred years hence. Not one even came close to predicting the culture of 1993.This book is not just a clear demonstration of the foolishness of declaring what inventions and innovations the future will bring. It is also a cultural snapshot of the end of the 19th century -- not only in the answers these worthy notables give, but also in the assumptions inherent in the questions asked. ""What will be the future of the servant problem?"" ""What developments will most affect the American Indian in the Twentieth Century?""For all their many answers about culture and technology, not one of the many who were interviewed foresaw the growth and supremacy of the automobile over all other modes of transportation."
2,Sports bra,"It came in fine condition, but there is no way that the bra was a size medium. It has too long of straps for the bodace. I tried shrinking it and it still does not fit. Now I can't return it. I normally wear a medium so the sizing is faulty."
1,Bad Wedding Table Wishes,"Wow, Horrible. I am a huge Dennis Wilson/ Beach Boys fan but PU! This film/home movie is like those horrible wedding videos when the guy walks aroung table to table asking to record your thoughts on the bride and groom. There is 2 minutes of bad quality black and white film of Dennis at the end but nothing more here. I really don't care what all his High school friends thought the first time they saw him, yuk. Believe me, thats 99% of this. It is poorly done with phones ringing in the background, kids talking in the background, poor lighting etc. Like a very bad school project. Somebody please present a better doc. on Dennis then this! Real footage, real interviews , how about a song of his PLEASE!"
3,looks like a homemade video. but it's cool for hardcore bb fans,"Don't get me wrong...there are a few interesting insights and anecdotes shared by those interviewed regarding the subject. for example, it was cool to hear what mike love and bruce johnston had to say about their deceased bandmate in a new interview. however, i think i would have enjoyed more a proper documentary including archival footage and interviews with dennis himself (there are a some that exist...just check on youtube). fans of dennis should search out the book Dumb Angel...To me this is a definitive tribute to his legacy. Also, pick up his solo record , Pacific Ocean Blue. Although, i reckon you already have that music if you're reading this review."
2,Let the buyer beware on this one.,"Like the other reviewer of this cd, I am also a fan of Buffalo Tom. Unfortunately this doesn't sound very similar to BT, in fact it is a bit dull. None of the songs seem to have hooks or melodies that stick - after you hear it you instantly forget it. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 to be fair, since I only played it 3 times, hoping it would grow on me. I'd recommend ""Up Here"" instead of this one, it's much more listener friendly."
1,Bad bad bad...,"I am an Alexandrian initiated Witch.So I thought I should have something with Sanders in it right ? Wrong,like my HP told me years ago Sanders was a showboat ! I bought this DVD and after watching it threw it out! It is so bad I didn't want to resell it. Don't waste your money,trust me !"
1,Do Not Buy Anything from Grizzly,This product is absolute trash. It arrived from Grizzly broken and they would not replace it under their warranty and they charged me the wrong price to my credit card even though I have e-mail confirmation for the sale price.
2,Less than It Should Be,"I mean no disrespect to the authors of the recipes included in this book. Their efforts to share memories and look to the future through favorite recipes was valiant.But they deserved better than the rest of this book, which was repetitive and simplistic. Other than the translator, the modern-day contributors to the book clearly didn't know their stuff. They either should not have written anything, or they should have done a more substantial job with what they did write."
1,In Memory's Kitchen : A Legacy from the Women of Terezin,"This book was not at all what I expected from the short review I read elsewhere. There was very little story line, which could be expected, but the recipes weren't even usable. Who can find ""goose fat'' at the local grocery store, or has a local sausage maker who wouldn't mind putting your prepared goose into his smoker for two days? I know it was more a historical narrative, but the ingredients were measured in decagrams, which is converted in the back of the book into 0.35 ounces, which is how many tablespoons again? Sorry. I guess I should have researched it a little more before buying.Joe Miller, Cincinnati, Ohio"
5,"Excellent service, price & delivery",Received the item well before the due date. 1/2 the price of any local pool supply dealer. Beat all other online suppliers in price. Great service and delivery. Will definitely do business with site again. Great product and easy to install. Highly recommend it to everyone thst needs a new pump and basket.
1,No color photographs...,This very expensive book contains 0 (zero) color photographs of the subject matter. I returned my copy immediately. I wish that publishers would take note that buyers expect color photographs.
3,Doesn't clamp down easily,"It's a little loose on my battery terminal. It really should have been made a bit tighter. I was hoping for something that i could easily put on/remove but it's going to be more difficult because of that.Aside from that, I do like it. It does the trick well."
3,Nice for designs only,"If you want to use their design plans you will have to order them from the book. I wish this point wouldv'e been mentioned but as I know a little about plants I like it's more about the design and layout that i was interested in the most. They have nice designs although after about 20 os so, they tend to look the same. They also feature plans for decks, play house/sets, and more. ..."
4,Gives you Some Ideas,It has a lot of designs but to get the details you have to send money. It is surprising that with 225 designs there still isn't one that quite fit our situation. It did give us some ideas.
5,Landscaping Book,One of my very favorite books on landscaping design BEFORE you make a mistake!! Great buy--I'd do it again -Yes!
1,Where is the no star option?,"Let's just say that I saw it free on Hulu, and thank goodness it was free. Otherwise I can't find any justification for the enormous waste of time. I see what this movie is trying for- a cool, complex movie full of dark, twisty characters set in Los Angeles. However, indie it is not. Don't kid yourself. Instead, the characters are overly shallow and annoying to say the least, and cannot act to save their lives: Empty-headed girl who poses for pedophiles, pot smoker, more pot smokers, a wannabe musician who looks like he never fully woke up, a stony artist with too much time on his hands, pervert, more perverts, and...that's about it. Plot was messy and ridiculous, cinematography non-existent, storyline quality was a hairline above the text on a Taco Bell hot sauce packet, and the rest, well, it seemed to gear itself towards perverts. Really, the movie leaves you nothing but a raging headache and a belief that not everyone who can afford to finance a movie should do so."
1,Too much money for too little information,"I agree with Michael Troyanski's review. This book is way too basic and, at least to me, seemed very repetitive. The author spends too much time promoting the assessment center process rather than giving the candidate needed ideas and strategies. The pages are double spaced and the book has the appearance of being made on a copy machine. I was let down, given the astronomical price of the book. If you are new to the assessment center process it will give you a basic overview. I felt better prepared with materials and conversations I obtained from other folks in my agency that have already been through the process."
2,Poorly edited and better places to spend your $,"Purchased this book in preparation for a Captains assessment center. There were places in the book where the author says ""the memo below says ...."" The problem is there is no memo below. Very poorly edited and too expensive for what it provides. Another page had a paragraph that started in the middle of a sentence and did not even belong on the page itself?? Looks like an effort to make a quick $. I would not purchase it again for even a quarter of the price listed. For a Ph.D it is a poor writing example. Also , The sample assessment center exercise was for a SGT test not upper level. Choose a different author! Also the 2 positive reviews came after I posted this one and I bought the book only 10 days ago. I am trying to figure out how someone made Captain at a mid-western city in the last ten days and didn't post earlier unless it is the author trying to salvage a sale or two. stay away from this one. The Rowe book is excellent compared to this one."
4,Very good info,"Needed some guides for promotion preparation. This is one of several that I purchased, and I think all helped a little in different areas.If you have a lot of time to prepare and study (and you always should be preparing for promotion in ANY job) then get as many books & guides as you can. They will help you do better now, and get recognized now. When promotion time comes - you will be ready!"
5,One of the best Latino rappers.,Shadow puts it down for his city in this CD. Has the sickest beats around
2,The price is too high,"I reviewed the manuscript for the first edition of Davies's book for Routledge & Kegan Paul and recommended it fairly enthusiastically. The book was limited, but what it did it did relatively well. It was brief but clear, well-written, did not introduce too much of the usual mythology in discussing 'wave-particle duality' (I liked the discussion of the two-slit experiment), and went on to present the introductory ideas and mathematics of quantum mechanics in an attractive way. I used it in the spring of 1998 to prepare several lectures for my junior-level modern physics class, and recommended that my students read sections of it.I can not recommend this new edition. At $42.95 the cost is probably about four times that of the original edition. For a book of this size and limitation, a bargain at $10, $40 is ridiculously overpriced. At $42.95 there are too many attractive alternatives."
1,drops connection,"Bought one for the office on December 05. It does not work. Well, it does, but it goes on and off , dropping the conecction very offen. Users are complaining about the extra time it takes them to finish their job on the network. So I will have to buy another brand , as suggested by our IT advisor. I lost my money on this one."
1,Craptasticly Awful,"This is not a good switch. I have this switch in a production environment and it died without warning a year after installation. I returned the product to D-Link and got a replacement but the replacement died two months later. Instead of returning it again, I will be getting a different brand switch. I will now be careful to avoid D-Link products."
1,Beware: Drops All Connection (Faulty AC/DC Power Unit),"DGS-1008D, P/N:BGS1008DA.C3, H/W Ver.:C3. This gigabit switch repeatedly drops all connection. This happened to two of the D-Link DGS-1008D switches that we've purchased, so may indicate a manufacturing problem. Resolved problem by replacing AC/DC power supply units with non-Linksys brand."
1,Switch Stops Working,"I wish I had seen these reviews before buying. The switch stops working until it is cycled. This problem occurs sometimes once every few days to several times a day. Considering the price of the unit and information provided by other reviews, its not worth the time and effort getting an RMA, I'm just going to throw it out."
2,Drops Connection,I bought 2 of these and while they worked as I expected a switch should work for the first couple of months I started noticing that my machines were displaying network connection / reconnection messages all the time. I assumed it was the network card which I then replaced but after getting the same connect/reconnect message all the time I bought a Netgear gigabit switch and now have no problems at all. This was the first time I bought D-Link so it's hard to say there is a pattern here but the switch is obviously of low quality and after reading other feedback I would say this is a fairly common problem with these switches. Suggest you DO NOT BUY a D-LINK Switch.
1,same here,"the damn switch drops connections after a while. it's like the connections are extremely slow. it took me some searching to find the cause was the switch. the replacement has the same problem, so it's the product which has the problem."
