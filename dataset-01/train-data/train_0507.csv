2,"""Like new""","It said ""like new"" and there are about 10 pages in the middle that have a chunk ripped out of it. :("
2,tryied to get into it.,"I was looking at some of the reviews and found on that caught my interst. it was titled a ""A book that will hunt your quite time"". It was such an interesting review that I decided to read the book. but once I got the book I had a hard time getting passed the first few chapters. I finally pushed my self to get through it. with the words from my professor ""what doesn't kill you will only make you stronger""."
4,Fascinating Read!,"Invisible Man tells the story of a nameless African-American male. He goes through various experiences which contribute to his feeling of invisibility. Though the narrator feels he is nothing, his knowledge and insight, which he is constantly imparting to the reader, ensure that he does indeed exist. I recommend this novel to the reader who enjoys African-American literature. It is a long read (more than 500 pages), so you must have patience. Ellison's great descriptions and mastery of prose enhance the reading of this splendid novel. Spend some time, and you will find this book was worth it."
3,It's okay,"""Invisible Man"" is a story about a young black man struggling with racism in the 1960's. He hastrouble distinguishing the difference between right and wrong and has troubles battling his unintentionalinternalized racism. I think the book's ideal audience would be for people looking to educate themselveson different forms of racism such as the more subtle racism shown by the ""Brotherhood"" organization. In thebrotherhood, their leader was a white man named Jack who believed blacks could achieve social equality by behaving likewhites and forgetting their history. Reading the book is quite difficult because of how things are worded. Thereader can easily become lost in the text and find themselves repeatedly reading the same page. The book is alsofilled with symbolisms so that readers can find deep meaning in every page."
3,Invisible man: Race & Identity,"Ralph Ellison tries to explore the deep-rooted problem associated with race and identity. He uses some examples from the true reality observed during the sixties in this country to make his novel riveting. The one negative thing of the book is that the suspense of the story declines as you reaches the middle towards the end. I think you could have done a better. But overall, its quite a good read and I encourage many to read this book."
5,One of the seminal books on black alienation in America,"This is the tale of a man in his quest for identity and purpose in his life. He is an outsider in society -- where does he belong? He is an un-named protagonist who believes he is invisible. In his search for belonging, meaning and truth, he becomes in involved with a communist group, but eventually leaves it to find his own way. Other reviewers have given this book a better synopsis, so I will not add further, except to say that I found it a powerful work. I would also suggest James Baldwin's ""Sonny's Blues,"" and Richard Wright's ""Native Son."""
2,Skip the audio cassettes,"For the most part, this is an excellent set of tapes. Joe Morton does a remarkable job creating distinct voices and characters throughout his reading, often to the point where I had to remind myself that there was only a single man performing. And of course, the story is magnificent. There's only one problem with this set of tapes: they left off the ending. That's right, tape 11 out of 11 ends without the last chapter or the epilogue. I had to borrow a friend's copy of the book to read the ending. It's a real shame, this could have been an excellent set of tapes."
5,Required Reading for Urban Psychology,"This along with the Autobiography of Malcolm X are the two most powerful portrayals of East Coast urban psychology between the castigated and demoralized black man and the white insitutionalized power-holders circa 1930-1950. While both end in tragedy, this one perhaps is more demoralizing as the protagonist eventually becomes completely alienated from his neighborhood, city, and nation at large. Becomming the victim of a witch-hunt and unraveling of the moral fabric of his neighborhood, the protoganist doesn't achieve freedom or enlightenment, but instead whithers away in despair. Very upsetting and scary portrayal of the effects of marginalized politics and socio-economic/racial polarization."
5,musical!,"Ellison studied music in college, and it shows. The book hangs together like a jazz piece, on an edge so precarious and so exquisite that it blows your mind. The way that themes are layered and build to crescendo after crescendo is amazing!In my view, this book is not merely about race. It seems to be about modernity's influence on the human condition. Racism, in this novel, is just one aspect of a larger problem: a widespread loss of respect for people's integrity, as illustrated by the ...kissing black ""professionals,"" white racists, ""social activists,"" and the confidence man."
2,Aren't we all invisible?,"The first half of this book really had my interest. It is well-written and it kept the reader enthralled. Once the narrator joins the Brotherhood the book is no longer a thought-provoking journey which the reader shares with the main character but, instead, becomes a giant soap box on which Ellison stands, pouring out his views on humanity, on prejudice, and on what he sees as the ""invisibility"" of the black man. This is not to say what he writes is unimportant, on the contrary it is quite important- and powerful. I felt the book lost everything when it moved, mid-stream, from a novel about the black experience and man's search for identity to a speech-filled tirade on the identity crisis of Black Americans."
2,invisible man,"In this novel, the narrator struggles to please the wealthy white American community while the African American community looks down upon him for doing so. From the south, he travels north to New York and experiences how differently African Americans are treated in this area. He settles in New York, and there he tries to find his true identity. In my opinion, I didn't enjoy reading this novel and I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
4,Review,"Ralph Ellison (the assumed author) goes to a good school in the south but gets kicked out for unfortunate reasons. He then moves to Harlem and becomes one of the speech givers in an organization called ""The Brotherhood."" He author goes through many trials and complications. Being a senior in highschool my group chose this because the first sentence captivated our minds. It was as crazy as we thought it was going to be but lacked substance. I do not know if the author wanted his audience to be confused and disgusted, but I guess that's why we were attracted to it. Ralph Ellison's book the ""The Invisible Man"" is a good buy if you want to be a revolutionary."
3,Book Review: Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison,"In this novel, the narrator goes to college and by turn of events, gets expelled. He goes to Harlem in search of a job and eventually finds work as a speaker for an organization called the Brotherhood. Over time, the organization and it's members go downhill and the streets of Harlem are run by rioters.I am a senior in high school and did not find the novel to be easy to relate to at all. The author did not provide substance to the main theme and tended to focus on minuscule events that took place throughout the novel. The intended audience is unclear and does not seem like anyone at all would relate to it.The novel is not worth purchasing and is not worth the time one would waste on reading it."
2,Invisible Man,"In this novel, the narrator , or the main character, struggles with himself. He struggles with his identity. He is an African American in a time where being Black did not get him much respect. He is awarded a scholarship to a very big college, and from there he goes to New York. While in New York City he joins an activist group called The Brotherhood.The main character , who through out the entire book does not have a name, has an internal problem. He is struggling to find himself.A major theme in this book was finding ones self. The book appealed to me in a logical way, it made me think about how many people don't know who they are, even as adults.Personally, this is a book I could have passed on. The chapters weren't clear, and the chapters ran when unnecessary. I would not waste my time or money on this book."
4,great in showing the nature of finding yourself,"This book shows how a person can find himself in a world whererace really does matter. This is a powerful novel. A lot of youngblack Americans should read this. If you are struggling and need to find yourself, this book gives you the courage to do so."
4,A Landmark in American Literature,"Invisible Man is a great book. It is the story of a young black man who embarks in search of a dream. On the way he discovers the true nature of our society and his place in it. In the end he finds not any dream but his true self, disenchanting as that may be. This is a superbly written book. Ellison has a command of the English language rarely achieved. His every word connects to a theme. Though frustrating at times, Invisible Man is well worth the effort."
3,Invisible Man dissapears!,"I'm listening/reading along with this CD/Book for an honors English class.It's the only way I can get through the assignment. Narrator is pretty good - makes the length of the book bareably. I'm on disk 5 and it will be listening for a long time. The story is getting better, so if you're reading/listening, don't give up hope."
2,Really really really long,"There is a lot of symbolism and stuff but it didn't seem consistent to me. Oh well, I'm not some kind of literary genius. But this book is really, really, really, really long, and probably not worth the time it takes to read, unless you *really* love it for its message or whatever. Great, but it's still long, and I found some of it confusing."
1,Not a good book for the teen,"I just finished this book, well actually I was too frusterated with it that i reviewed the last 4 chapters on sparknotes. Yes this book had some interesting points, but I feel that if I was of an older age I might have understood the concepts better and actually had some insight into this novel. I definitely do not suggest this book for Kids my age. I had to read this for english and when being forced to I wanted to pull my hair out. It started out slow and then got a little more interesting, but I was very disappointed. It's just not my type of book and not my writing style."
2,Decieved,"I bought this book thinking that it would be a new book. When I got the book, it was definitely used. Not Happy."
2,Great Book So far,"So far, this is a really great read! I don't know how I missed this years ago.. I read ALOT! But I agree with the person above's comment, that I found it easy to put the book down fom a while. I got a little bored with Ralph Ellison's overly descriptive imagination. I almost felt like he was what I a ""PAGE FILLER"" Just trying to make the book longer. I think this book is taking me the longest it ever has to read a book because of that one thing... But after I skipped a few pages (I don't usually do that.. but I just couldn't take it anymore) I got right back into it.. I let you know what I think once I finish...."
1,Wasn't Good At All!!,I had to read this book for school. I hated this book with a passion. I didn't like the main character. I also didn't like the fact that he didn't have a name. My teacher told us that he didn't have a name because Ellison wanted him to be universal. I mean it is hard to believe that it took all those hardships for him to 'find' himself. Is anyone that naive. I hope not. I would have wised up after Dr. Bledsoe lied about the letters of reccomendation!!! This wasn't a very good book at all in my opinion
1,Graphic,"I ordered this book for my son to read for his high school honors English class. After beginning to read, he promptly closed the book because of its graphic nature. It may contain some compelling scenes, but be forewarned that it's also graphic. We discarded the book."
2,Map coverage is misrepresented in the ads for this product,"Do not buy this product if you are looking for topo maps of Buescher State Park or Bastrop State Park. Even though Buescher State Park is one of the areas described within its coverage, the park is located close to Smithville, outside the western boundary of the detailed topo map (it's only on the overview maps, which aren't at a scale you can use for orienteering). The detailed topo map also cuts off about half of Bastrop State Park (which is further west of Buescher State Park, and ought to be included), so it's not very helpful for that area as well."
3,earrings,"The earrings I rec'd were not these ones pictured, mine have an extra layer dropping down. Not bad, just different, depends on what you want. The device to secure them in your ear is difficult to set & I wonder about the durability in the long run. am debating returning..."
2,Sterling Silver & Turquoise Bali Chandelier Earrings,"The earrings are lovely. However, they are very, very difficult to put on. Nearly impossible, in fact! You will need 15 to 20 minutes to get the job done. So either get up early for work, put them on the night before or have someone help you. It is a shame because they are really nice earrings.Sterling Silver Bali Chandelier earrings with Turquoise beads"
4,"Good Challenge to Evaluate Your ""Second Half""","""Mid-Life Manual for Men"" is a good challenge for men to evaluate what they want to do for the second half of their lives and look for significance instead of just material and career success.Arterburn goes over the various chapters and roles in a man's life:1. Son2. Husband3. Provider4. Father5. Etc.The author shares his own struggles in successes as he himself is going through the second half of his own life. While the book is targeted towards Christians, any man looking for signifance in his second half will benefit from the book.Read, enjoy, and be challenged!Recommended."
2,Silly Rhetoric,"Having read ""Every Man's Battle"" and taking away a lot of useful information and techniques, I really looked forward to reading this book. I was disappointed in the first few pages. The writing sounds like a silly conversation. While the style may engage some, it made anything useful the authors had to say non-authoritative. Arterburn's previous book was well-written, well-organized and useful. This book made me feel like he was just writing a book to write another book. There was very little applicable information relative to other books on midlife issues. The bottom line is, if the reader is looking for some midlife direction, this book may provide a couple of ideas, areas of focus, and techniques, but not many. Look elsewhere for advice on the midlife, male topic."
5,Will's Review,"I really enjoyed this book, because it was very informative, but provided down to earth information that men could actually relate to."
3,A nice change of pace...,"After reading mysteries/thrillers/murders with twists and turns books lately, it was a nice change of pace reading Magnificent Seven. A typical cookie-cutter romance. A fast fun read. Man with twin 6 year old daughters, woman with 3 children adds to seven. A little more 'lovemaking' then I care to read...as I tend to skip over those parts. I wouldn't be able to share this book with young readers. Shame because otherwise it would been recommended."
3,Crimping tool,"Inexpensive tool for crimping coaxial cable. Seems to work well for what it was designed to do. If I were in the business I would have opted for one with better quality, but good enough for home owner use."
5,Becoming Real,"Loved the book, read it twice within two weeks and then passed it on as I like to do with all books that lift me up. It's the real deal:) ()()"
3,Paris-budget size and super size.,"Beware, there are two hardcover versions of this book.A small approximately 5"" X 10"" 78 pp hardcover edition at half the price of a larger(more pages and larger size) more expensive hardcover version.I know, I bought the larger more expensive version after buying the smaller version, I knew I had to have the larger one."
2,"Terrible service, terrible taste, not worth the buy.","My experiance with this company has been nothing but bad. Placed the order on the 3rd, arrived on the 16th. Bought this product with aticipation of taste and quality but the smell of the tea and the taste(even when washed) was utterly disgusting, making lipton tea seem desirable. I highly discourage buying this item or from this company if you enjoy quality loose leaf tea. If you are just getting into it loose tea and want to try some thing different or want to use these are decoration, then these may suit you."
4,Blooming tea!,I have never seen blooming flower tea and was amazed when I tried this. The little tea ball blooms when you place it into water! Looks pretty and tastes good
3,Not quite what I thought it would be,"The blooms in the water were beautiful, but the tea itself hada very gritty, almost ""earthy"" taste to it which i didnt like. I used them to make interesting centerpieces because when they bloom its gorgeous, but I owuld not suggest actually trying to drink this stuff. Plus some of the ""petals"" get loose and float to the top which make it have that ""gritty"" taste."
2,You Already Know...,"I have been using a pendulum daily for over 10 years with about an 80 to 85 percent accuracy (overall). Your higher consciousness knows the answers.I totally disagree with this ""light being"" stuff. Sure everyone has guides, but the pendulum reacts to your energy, not someone elses.The pendulum is a simple and effective tool of divination. Most of the stuff mentioned is unnecessary. You already know the answer, you don't need anything else."
2,"""Ultimate"" -Not!","Hmm, I thought this would be the ticket for my SIG IWB carry. I was wrong. RE-holstering? Fuhgetaboutit. Mine has no reinforcement around the opening so it collapses when the weapon is drawn. The molding is OK, just rather generic. I do not foresee any retention issues due to the molding. Of course that could be due to the fact that it rides low (a good thing generally). Now my biggest issue is that ""patented J hook"". Like the gun to remain at a consistent cant? Fuhgetaboutit. And yes kids, I am using a gun belt, in fact I use the Galco conforming. In a word, ah words, that little plastic hook's width just does not anchor the holster at a fixed cant."
2,Not so good,"This book is dated, so if you're looking for details on 2.6 kernel implementations you're going to be disappointed. Worse still, the book doesn't cover distributions that don't already have SELinux support. Overall I found the discussion of the theory of SELinux to be good, but implementation details were sorely lacking. Ultimately it didn't answer the questions I had (how do I install SELinux on Mandriva and configure it) so wasn't worth the price."
5,Trouble,"This product was a perfume that my wife has been out of for over a year, she was very surprised to get it as a gift and I had forgotten how nice she smelled wearing it. Great product for the money!"
1,Shocked and Appalled,"This book is how research should not be done! I am from Kansas City and know idividuals involved. Fleisher is not only biased but is completly unethical. He made promises that he did not keep and abandoned these kids when it suited him. I feel sorry that these kids trusted someone and were only taken advantage of once again. Very sad that this his ""study"" has been given any credit as being either scientific or even useful when it comes to gang intervention. If it would not boost his sales, I would recommend this book to any teacher who is trying to teach students what not to do. However, I would hate to see him profit off his exploitation of these kids."
1,Disgusted!,"Fleisher vividly describes the abusive treatment the children of these gansters received from their parents and their ganster friends, the filth they lived in, the lack of food and the overall dangerous living conditions. Did he report this to Family Services? Professor Fleisher is a mandated reporter and conducting research for a best seller should not discount his responsibility to those children in helping to make them safe. I am appalled that a Criminal Justice professor would write with such coldness and lack of concern: ""It always took me a week to 10 days before I stopped recalling in my mind's eye the sight of Amy and RoniRo sequestered with Teresa and Kevin."" pg. 97 I hope Professor Fleisher sleeps well knowing these children will soon be teenagers and his contribution to their well-being."
5,Recommended,I bought this as a gift for a friend as he says he really enjoys this coffee. I have not tried it myself but have tried other flavors and decaf flavors and enjoyed them.
4,An Historical Gem,"The Jewels of Warwick is a hard-to-put-down, fast-paced, dynamic, character-driven novel with a sound historical base and wonderful descriptive passages. However it is the strength of the ""Jewels"" - Topaz and Amythyst Plantagenet - that shines through the drama, intrigue, and love lives of these remarkable women. The authenticity of dress, manner, and historical events gave added interest to this many-faceted and multi-splendored depiction of court life in England during the early years of the 16th century."
5,A sleeper,"This book was written long before most readers of this review were born. Maybe that's the reason this great work of science fiction lies dormant and almost forgotten. The book is absorbing, fires the imagination, is both believable and original. I don't believe, of all the thousands of books of science fiction I've read over half a century, I've ever read one similar to this (and few better).The basic story involves a starship the size of a small city on a voyage lasting hundreds of years. Many generations prior to the time of this plot a cataclysmic event and internal disruptions caused the crew to break into factions and isolate themselves. Thereafter the population forgot itself, what it was, and struggled to survive and understand, by the time of this plot, in a strange world.If you'd like to discover a 'new' old one you'll treasure and read many times through your life this is a good shot at finding one, while it can still be obtained. Take good care of it."
5,Very Funny Indeed,"Though it is the second in the series, this was my first Rumpole. I was charmed, and I fully enjoyed it. Rumpole is an aging, cantankerous barrister. He specializes in defense in seemingly hopeless cases. His domineering wife, Hilda, is ""she who must be obeyed."" Amidst a cast of thoroughly quirky, thoroughly English characters, Rumpole proceeds in his goal of protecting the notion of innocent until proven guilty, and upholding the importance of the jury. Rumpole's (a.k.a. Mortimer's) use of language is fabulous, calling the court the ""palais de justice,"" describing himself in the third person at just the right time. This volume sees Rumpole sorting out a group of actors, defending a schoolteacher accused of leading on a student, and fighting his family as they try and get him to retire."
4,Long Time Coming,"Like countless other skaters who grew up in the 80's and early 90's, this CD holds a special importance. It happens quite a bit in pop culture. Somehow elements align, as esoteric as they are, and a true phenomena permeates thru a group of people whether they know each other or not, and a period of time is forever frozen, documented and marvelled over. The quality on this CD isn't very good, the instrumentation is ok, the music is scattered, but something wonderful is there. I searched for Milk for a solid 4 years and never found it. I know many others who have too. Now we have it, and it feels as good as when it rolled along in the legendary skate video, Blinds' "" Video Days "". All is good once again."
4,Does the job,"I bought this amp locally to use with an attic antenna. I have it in the attic and run coax from it to HDTVs in both my living room and bedroom. Perhaps it could be better, but it does a great job counteracting the signal loss over the long cable runs. I could have it in the house and use less cable, sure...but then it would only have the weaker signal to work with. This isn't the fault of the amp--any will have the same problem. Just be sure to keep it close to the source and it will work pretty well."
3,WRECKED,A movie that draws you into the story..I enjoyed it..A movies that shows true life and the consequences of choices.
2,Softcore porn...,"since the film has already been reviewed by others, i'll just go to say that if you want to watch this movie, rent it. save yourself some money. The plot has been used one too many times, the cast wasnt too good. The only thing that's ""artsy"" about this film is the fact that there's a photographer, an actor, and a play thats occuring during the film. It literally is soft core porn. Thats prob the only reason why i gave it 2 stars. other than that...umm no thanks."
4,Not quite a five star,This is not a movie that I will watch over and over like Latter Days or Shelter. But all in all not too bad. I will watch it a few times.
5,Awesome,"didn't think i would like this at first, it's very rough. but the story is great, once you get into it."
2,Forgot I saw this flick. It was forgettable,"Nothing to write home about. It was claustrophobic and very indie and not in the good indie way, oh well"
1,Deppressing !,This is about 3 gay young men. One of them makes a stab at doing something meaningful by auditioning for a play. The other 2 just use drugs and have sex all day. The one attempting to get a part in the play is hopelessly bad. The play manager just strings him along because he wants to have sex with him. The other actors are very bad also. I'll stop there. This movie leaves me cold. It is hard to like the 3 main young men because they are so messed up.
1,WOW!!! HORRIBLE!!!!,"This was quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen, in any Genre!! Unfortunately it was a gay theme filmed and perpetuated most of the gay stereotypes that we as gay men have fought to avoid for years. The talentless hack that made this film should be Drawn and Quartered!!"
2,Hmmm...,"Well, I wish I'd noticed earlier that this was (I assume) a very low budget film. Quality/sound aren't great, and I'm pretty sure a bunch of guys got together and decided to film in their house with an ordinary video camera. Not terribly fun. I can't say how the plot line was, since I only watched a few minutes."
1,"My day was ""Wrecked"" by sitting through this ""movie""","This appears to be nothing more than a series of unscripted, improvised scenes, a great many of them sexual. Is it supposed to be a (im-)morality tale? Can't tell. Production values are non-existent. The only reason anyone would watch this is for the many, obviously not just simulated, sex scenes. But the characters (and, alas, actors) are unappealing. We get it: they are young; they do drugs; they have lots of sex. But we are given no reason to care about any of these characters. And, I am afraid, even if we did care, the movie is so meandering and poorly made that it would still be torturous to sit through. Spare yourself!"
1,The single worst movie ever! Wish I could give zero stars.,"I regret wasting my time and money in this movie. The film was like a bad porn movie. The only difference is that in a bad porn there is more sex, and it's better sex. Bad porn would also have better acting and a better plot. This crappy movie has editing that looks like it was done on iMovie, and the music is clearly the default sample tracks from GarageBand. If I could rate it zero stars, I would."
2,Becareful buying such large quantitiy,"Because the description of this product was extremly poor, i bought a large quantity not knowing you need only a tea-spoon for a single tree (every 3 months)... now i have over-paid and have enough to last me 1000 years.Haven't seen if the product works, but assuming it does, purchase the 1lb or smaller container and save yourself $100."
5,Binoculars,"Very good product, i had recomended a lot, i use it to bird watch, thank you very much, byeDIEGO"
4,Easy to use,"I find these to be well made and easily adjustable, as good as any others I have used. Comfortable on long hikes."
4,"Easy to install and comfy, but..","Pros: I enjoyed it along all our travels. Once you put it if you're going on and off your car (on a scenic route for instance, or birds/whale watching) I kept it while driving. It was no problem. Good distribution of weight for a prolonged period of time compared with the original neckstrap which at one moment I felt like choping my neck!Cons: It did not come as advertised: at the end of the strap I expected to be like in the advertised picture: a standard camera strap in order to attach the QD system connectors. It came with some fixed plastic hooks and you have to install 2 metal rings on the binoculars (which personally I do not like). Somebody thought that this might be an improvement! Honestly my intention was to use this harness for both bino and camera mainly on my hiking trails where I don't want always to carry the camera in my hand instead of hanging from my neck (and so the danger to smash it against a rock)."
2,Nikon Harness,"I purchased this harness for my new Nikon SE bins. Let's cut to the chase. I've had a different harness from Crooked Horn Outfitters for over 10 years. That harness is amazing and well built. What a contrast to the Nikon that I just purchased. The Nikon is uncomfortable and cheaply constructed. If you just need a harness for the backyard the Nikon will do, but if you want a harness for birding, hiking or hunting, do yourself a favor and buy the CHO model. The Zeiss / Swaro / Leica harnesses are all made by this company. They are made in the USA and will last you a long time.I do not work for this company but I love high quality products. Nikon should brand one through them as well."
4,Comfortable harness for binoculars.,"I thought the plastic tie-backs were tacky, but were needed because the binoculars do not have large enough hooks to clip the harness to it. The harness makes it very comfortable."
3,No instructions,"The harness works well enough. It didn't come with instructions on how to attach it, I envisioned a harness that allowed for better clip and release functions."
4,works as intended,"Keeps the binoculars close to your body so when you lean over they don't swing out away from your body possibly striking something, damaging the binoculars. Would recommend to anyone that will be moving around when using their binoculars."
3,I should have sent it back,"One of the drawbacks of Amazon is returning marginal items, and this is one of those. I bought a Nikon binocular (which I really like) to replace my older Brunton binoculars, and I bought this harness for the Nikon. But I liked my Cabelas camo harness for the Brunton so much I swapped it off and never used the Nikon harness, so this Nikon harness has just been sitting in the box."
1,Non-useable harness,Harness comes with no means to attach it to the binoculars therefore it cannot be used as-is.
4,A decent bino harness...,"This is a decent, pretty standard bino harness. If you're still using the neck strap, the benefits of the harness are that you don't have a sore neck at the end of the day, your binos don't bounce and swing on your chest as you walk or do other activities, and it slightly stabilizes your grip while viewing. The harness is highly superior to the neck strap!!!Down sides of this model: The quick-release clasps are actually a little tricky to unclasp. Maybe this is a good thing if you have super-expensive binos, but I find it a little frustrating. Also, the plastic strap-junction pieces aren't designed quite as ergonomically as they could be. There's a big ""Nikon"" logo on the back that I wish wasn't there. But if you find it for a competitive price, go for it.Another downside: The bino harness makes you look like you're some tool thinking he's tough because he's wearing a pseudo-gun-holster (ie Gareth Keenan's cell phone holster in ""The Office"")."
2,Harness was not as shown in the picture.,"I bought this harness because of the connecting straps from the harness to the binoculars. I have compact binoculars and wanted the extention straps for a better fit. The set I received did not have the extention straps included. The harness was the same as all the other harnesses I could buy locally for much less money with the only difference being the name on the back. If you are buying these because of the extention straps, you should email the seller first to make sure the straps are included before spending the extra dollars. They were well made, just not the same item as shown in the picture."
2,Keep losing fenders,"I loved these when I first got them. You can pull your fenders into the boat so easily, without having to untie the line - just pull the clip up.However, over time I guess they loosened up and while the boat sways in the dock and rubs the side, the fenders can get pushed up creating slack in the line, then the fender clips just fall off and the fender falls and floats away. It happens when we take the boat out of the slip sometimes but we can just grab them back, when we are not there however we just loose the fender :("
4,Works.,"Although a metalic silver in color, these fender adjusters are abs plastic. Fender adjuster is kind of a misnomer, as in the picture one must adjust the fender height and then tie a knot in the line to secure that height - it's more of a fender holder than adjuster. Even so, they do not appear to be flimsy and they do work well on the 1.25"" square tube rails on my Bennington pontoon, even where the rails but up against furniture, and securing a line to the railing directly is impractical. The adjusters snap on very securely, and can be slid side to side with a little effort. The hole size on these is 1/4"", and I find the maximum diameter line they will accomodate is 5/16""."
2,great idea,Good idea but misleading. they made it sound so easy in the description. We had to send it back because it would not hold our older tv. My husband said it had a weight limit and anything but a flat screen was too heavy.
5,Still kickin' up a storm after all these years.,"Now over thirty years old, this album still sounds as fresh as a daisy. It is a minor milestone in that it incorporates 'traditional' musicians of one generation - Bob Cann and Jimmy Cooper - with the electirc folk sound of the post revival era. And boy does it work. The sound is one that gets your feet going and this would make a great band to grace any barndance or ceilidh. Bob Cann's and Jimmy Cooper's playing has all the zest and lift you would expect and coupled with the likes of Ashley Hutchings and Graeme Taylor, the whole album rattles along with tremendous life. If you missed this first time around then get it while you still can. You will not be disappointed."
5,Great CD/DVD - My 2 year old already memorizing words,"I heard about this cd/dvd on the radio and after reading the reviews here I bought it for my 2 year old son. It is great, the songs are not long, very clever, and I don't mind listening to them over and over either. My son loves watching the dvd and already knows some of the words, which is awesome because the words are straight from the bible."
5,Hide em in your Heart II,"Arrived quickly, in great shape, and exactly as I requested. It is a great CD for helping to learn the Scriptures."
3,I was surprised...,"Let me begin by letting you know I'm a mom, not a young boy. I bought this book for my son, who owns volume one. We've read volume one together, we liked it and so I went ahead and bought this one.The book is sturdy, well drawn and has O.k. dialogue and story lines (typical comic book stuff). I thought it was just like the t.v. cartoon.I was surprised and a little disappointed that in one of the stories (the book has a few short stories not one long one) it showed a few people totally undressed. The pictures weren't completely revealing; the characters all used their hands to cover up, or were covered by something else in the foreground, but a lot of flesh was shown. I'd say a bit more than in most bathing suits. I'm sure plenty of parents wouldn't think it was a big deal, but as a somewhat conservative parent, I would've skipped this volume had I known."
3,It'd be Okay if...,"This comic book would be okay if they had skiped the one called ""Naked City"", or at least change it around. What I didn't like about it was that Beastboy and Starfire where nude in it. And Raven looked so much diffrent. This was sooo not made by the producer of Teen Titans!"
4,two good albums of post schenker era,"This 2 on 1 cd is sort of cut short in some places which is most annoying on the wild, willing and innocent especially between long gone and the wild willing and innocent. Besides that it is still very good. The wild, willing and innocent is the better of the two cd's. Anybody who thinks that there isn't any good songs on it are a little off course. True schenker era is my favorite but profession of off of twtwi is one of ufo's best songs with a great solo at the end of the song. twtwi is about 88 percent of 100 there. Mechanix could have been better produced in some places but still baosts some good songs...back into my life, let it rain are the best on it"
3,Decent post-Schenker recordings,"Collectively, the 2 albums on 1 CD offer some good post-Schenker rock 'n roll. My main complaint about this collection in particular is that six of the eighteen songs sound like they were cut short (to make it all fit on one disc, I assume). This makes me very wary about purchasing other ""2 on 1"" collections*. The editing isn't even done tastefully--the tracks are just hacked off seconds (or minutes?) before the song ends. For those who are interested, I will now list the ""hacked tracks"":Chains Chains, Long Gone, You'll Get Love, We Belong To The Night, Terri, Feel It.* UPDATE: I took the chance and bought the ""No Heavy Petting/Lights Out"" collection. I was going to be very irate if they messed with these two classic albums. Good news: Both albums are intact. Purchase any others at your own risk."
1,Hacked Off,"A very sad story. Great music, but an awful record company. The first time I saw two of my favorite UFO records in one CD, I was delirious. It couldn't be better, so I bought it. The dream ended as soon as the CD began to play. Many tracks of ""The Wild, the Willing and the Innocent"" were hacked off at the end. It was not editing; the CD was defective. More important: it was not only that CD. As some reviewers have stated, there is a big problem with this edition. I have bought three copies (different stores and times) and been forced to return them. How come ... the company (Beat Goes On Records) keeps producing it? Beware, buyers."
3,Two of their weaker albums.,"These two albums are not the best by UFO. It sounds like they are just trying to finish the project so they can move on to something else. Phil Mogg is a better vocalist than what you will hear on this CD. Michael Schenker is long gone and the rest of the band just goes through the motions. Still, you can't ignore a song like ""Chains Chains"" and that alone makes this worth the three stars I give it."
4,Convenient and good quality stroller,"I really wanted an orange stroller- and this is an orange stroller (not red as described) so if you like orange, it is! This stroller has everything I need and it was easy to put together, despite the unusually vague instructions. No problems with alignment. I got this model because I thought the hand brake would be helpful...I was going to use it roller blading but the instructions warn against it. So if I don't actually roller blade with the stroller, I see no point to the hand brake and wish I had gotten a model with a revolving front wheel, because it truly takes some getting used to tilting the stroller on it's back wheels to turn it."
5,Equals the original,I purchased this battery as a backup when I'm traveling. It seems to work as well as the original.
2,So it's a battery,It's a battery and it works.. plain and simple. The problem was the delivery!!! It took them too long to deliver it.
1,"These are old, with a short recharge life, end of the era.","It was because I could no longer obtain good quality BL-5C's that I finally gave up my Nokia phone.I think the last battery I tried in it was one of these, it actually had worse performance than the battery I had used for a year and was trying to replace.These might be phonies from China or just so old that they are chemically inert, but I am afraid I can't recommend these."
2,"Appears Worn, NOT BRAND NEW",This battery did not come in a NOKIA package and the black paint on the Nokia Hologram Logo is worn??? It only seem to last a little longer than the old one it replaces.
1,Battery no better than one a year old,The battery does not hold a charge and is no better than the old one I replaced.
2,good for a few months,The battery did fit properly in my Nokia cell phone. It needed more regular charges than the original when new. The original though was on it's last legs. After 7 months the replacement battery wouldn't hold a charge so I ended up putting the original back in. I have to charge the original way too often (but it STILL works) and will be buying another replacement.The seller acknowledged that the battery was under warranty and offered a replacement but hasn't responded for weeks.The seller did the easy part in promptly shipping the battery. Since then the seller is as disappointing as the battery.
4,Replacement battery for an old Nokia phone,"My old battery was dying. I got this new one; the price is great, and so far it is working well!"
5,OEMShop in the Best,"This is my second experience with OEM shop and it's not disappointed at all and I'm really satisfied.Thank you very much and be ready for my Third order ;-)Regards,Ahmed Wahid"
3,Oops,"From the description, I thought this would work in my Nokia phone which normally uses the BL-4c. Wrong! It is just enough fatter that it will not fit into the compartment. Trying to get it in, I dislodged the bottom cover plastic (a thin piece that covers the end opposite the contacts) so it was not returnable.The price was low enough I don't much mind, but I thought I might save someone else from making the same mistake."
5,BETTER THAN NEW!,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!All I have to say is that NOKIA charges $40!I've replaced the batteries in BOTH our NokiaCell Phones and they both keep a charge aslong as the original for a fraction of the cost.
3,does not last as long as the original battery used to,"I have a Nokia 6555 and the original battery had reached the end of its life and the talktime had gone down so much that I could seldom make or receive a call as the phone would reboot midway. So I ordered this battery. The new battery has made my phone usable once more. But it seems to last much less than the original battery used to when it was new. I reported this to the seller and they sent a replacement, but the replacement does not have any more juice than the 1st one. Neither my wireless service provider nor my usage of the phone has changed in the last few years. It is possible that the wireless phone network has changed in such a manner that requires phones to transmit at a higher power or something."
1,Review of Nokia battery,"I am not pleased with this purchase. I needed a new battery for my cell phone. I did a search through Amazon and purchased the battery. This was a waste of money, as the battery will not hold a charge."
5,It's a battery and it works,"$4 including free shipping versus $40 in a shop. It may not be a ""genuine"" product but it really looks like it is to me and it works."
2,Old Batteries From Off The Shelf,"Originally I was happy that the correct battery arrived, and quickly. Then I noticed that it didn't hold a charge any better than the 3-year-old battery I was replacing. Clearly, it's as least as old as my OEM battery. Boo!"
2,Excellent Features But Shipped Defective Unit,"I purchased two of these GMRS units. Outstanding features, longest outreach on the market for type (7 miles max.) One of the two units shipped with a defective PTT Switch (talk button). By the time I discovered it, 30 warranity period had expired. The two units now set in a draw unused. I would not purchase again because of the short warranity period and feature set being overly complex for everday casual use in my opinion."
3,Range is havily overquoted!!!!,"GMRS7000 is a good two way radio, but the range is havily overquoted. The actual range is about 2 miles in open field, less in town or buildings. As all two way radios, forests reduce drastically the range (less than a mile!).Another issue, is the battery meter which can show you 100% of battery available but, when you try to transmit, the meeter go to 0% and the display goes off. Of course you're not able to transmit anything. So you have to carefully count the hours wou've used the radio to have a rough idea of the available battery.Also you don't have any indication in the instruction book of how long to charge the accumulators.Beaside this, it's a good product. As I haven't owned other long-range two way radios (just a Motorola 0.5W) I don't know if other have the same problems."
1,Not Working from the Start,We ordered the unit as a gift before Christmas. The unit was opened in mid January and won't transmit. It appears to be a defect in the PTT switch or mike. The short warranty might as well not exist. Still trying to get some help. I own three other FRS radios made by a different leading manufacturer which in three years have never had a problem.
2,to technical for me,It was not what I thought it was. Above my head and did not answer the questions I had on this subject. Will probably send it to the Goodwill for their book selection.
2,more blog than craft...,"I hate to give such a low rating but must admit I was dissappointed with this book.My biggest complaint? As per the book's subtitle- ""not you Granny's crafts""-one would intimate that this is a craft book. Not so.There are about 8 projects in the entire book-most of the book is actually more of a journal of the ""avant crafters"" who contribute to the book. Backgrounds of their lives and why they craft outside the box.While that was somewhat interesting-it's not what I bought the book for. If I wanted to read crafters journals I could peruse the hundreds of blogs online for free.I'm hoping the artists in this book will consider putting out another book-this time chock filled with the unusual craft projects that should have been in this book and were not.If you are looking for unusual craft projects-I'd sadly suggest you skip this book and check out free websites like craftster."
3,the packaging was better than the content,"This is a well put together and entertaining book, but many of the projects werent anything illuminating-- a cross stitch pattern, or how to make soap-- some were the first I'd seen-- making bracelets out of colored vinyl records, but required some specialized tools (and colored vinyl) that wouldnt be that easy to get, or worth the money for future endeavors. Get this from the library before you buy it, as there arent really that many amazing projects in it. If you like the ones you see, then invest in the book.again, great package, not overly impressed with the content, although I have seen worse."
1,i had much higher hopes,"after checking out a lot of the websites of people who participate in the bazaar bizarre i was expecting a great craft book. i got this book for christmas and i doubt i will even keep it. the projects are nothing special, and nothing you couldn't find online with much better tutorials and photos. the lack of photos is a big drawback of this book. as a visual person, i want lots of photos with instructions close by, and this book did not deliver."
1,"I love the unusual, but this book is beyond bad","This is one of the strangest books I've ever seen. I bought it because I LOVE unusual things, altered art, and oddities, but this book, in my opinion, relates to none of those things. It lacks in so many areas, I am not even going to try to list them all. To me, this book almost ridicules or ""pokes fun"" at arts and crafts. To be more specific, this IS a CRAFT book. I can't see looking at this book from an artistic point of view, whatsoever. However, this book is true to it's title: BAZAAR BIZARRE. I was terribly disappointed."
3,Disappointed,"I thought the crafts and the craftspersons were very cool, but I found the author to be annoying and supercilious and his instructions unclear."
2,Not so Bizarre.,Bought this for my thirteen year old daughter. She only liked one item...the clip on dreadlocks.
1,weirdness for the sake of weirdness,"Unless you like weirdness for the sake of weirdness, don't bother with this one. Not my cup of tea.I admire the author for trying to do something different, but there's too much of his life story and silly anecdotes from other contributors in this collection... how about some real projects? There aren't many. As someone else wrote, a sock monkey is basically a sock monkey.Der Ananian has some real talent, and a collection that features only HIS projects would be much more interesting. Put the silliness aside. It seems like he was just trying to pay tribute to his crafting friends and promote their work instead of giving any benefit to his readers at all."
4,Silly and fun,"(if it happens to hit your tastes right--it did mine)You get to see how some self-proclaimed flaming weirdos do crafts.There might even be one or two things in it I'd actually do, or more likely, adapt."
5,Around the World with Melinda,"From the minute I opened this book I knew it was a must have for my library. Every design is unique, though not for the faint of heart. Most items are challenging enough for the most advanced knitter while many are still manageable for the intermediately skilled. My first project had to be the sweater featuring the exquisite geisha portrait, which I chose to duplicate stitch for added depth. With clear, precise directions & graphs, there are no problems to producing garments with a panache you'll be proud to be seen wearing."
5,AWESOME!,Well this is the first REAL rock album from Italy! A totally awesome rock voice of a lady whose story is incredible! The album was realeased in '99 but the sound is still modern and lyrics are joined in such an emotional concept. I suggest it to everybody who likes rock and melodies.
3,Backlight?,Not much trouble setting it up. Outside sensor works well from the exterior wall of my bedroom about 15-20 feet away. Readings jive with my Davis weather station. However Amazon and Honeywell's websites both indicate this product has a blue back light. There is not reference to this on the packaging or the owners manual. I emailed customer support for guidance. I'll let you know what they say.
1,"Personally, i love it but...",Amazon took WayyyyyYY Too long to ship it to me...and i ordered it a few months ago..and the estimated ship date is in may...what the hell???so i cancelled
5,best of the pack,"We have a similar unit by another manufacture at our vacation home. I wanted one for our primary residence but couldn't find the same model and brand. And that's a good thing, because this one out performs our original one. It's more reliable and the batteries have already lasted for a year (the other model required new batteries every few months). I may end up replacing the one in our vacation home with this model. The longer battery life alone could pay for the purchase."
2,poor instrument,The indoor temperature reading is good and the clock is good too. But the outdoor reading died in less than 6 months. Even new batteries didn't help. I expected a better product
1,Hello ... Honeywell??,"This thing is a royal pain to set up, and even then if you are fussy enough to actually want the sensor ""outdoors,"" you're in for trouble. I could not get it to transmit 25 feet through a line of sight window for more than a few hours.It's a toy, and not a very good one at that. It reminded me of the ""walkie talkies"" kids used to have, that worked only while you and your friend were within 5 feet of each other!"
2,"Reasonable, but only barely ...","I have had one of these units for about 3 years now, and find that it has a number of bad mannerisms. I use the clock and the temperature functions. Most of the time, it works fine. I never use the alarm. The unit is prone to throwing little electronic fits from time to time such as refusing to tell me the outside temperature. The fix is usually to put the two units adjacent to each other for a while. However, yesterday (06/20/08), the inside unit registered 112 deg F at 5 am. It had been 112 outside the day before, but was around 75 at 5 am. I opened the outside unit, replaced the batts (it prefers DuroCells), pressed reset and closed it up. It still showed 112 on the inside unit. I opened that one up, pulled the batts, let it stand for a while and put in 2 new DuroCells. Then I let them commiserate together for a while, and the system decided to work again. The system is working fine as I write this."
5,A must Have & I mean it,"If you Owen an Archos DVR , then you must get this one , Because you will need it on the go.Traveling with the TV pod is not convenient."
4,it covers the headphoe area,"it works fine, it is handy and can be moved from one place to another. one small problem it covers partially the headphone area. otherwise it is nice to have"
5,love this cd,my children love these songs. they have simple words that my two young children can sing along with.
5,Wonderful,"This is one of my favorite lunch time reads. Everyone can use a proverb or a psalm to pick them up. This bible magazine is cute and fun to carry around with you, keep at your desk at work or to give to a young girl. It's also written in the NCV translation, which makes it easy for even for new believers to understand. I highly reccomemd it."
4,Good price to experiment,"This is not the instrument you'll keep for life, but if you want to check it out and see if you like it, this is a great choice."
4,Almost perfect!,"I loved this latest by Linda Howard. I would actually give it a 4.5 as it is close to perfect. Sarah and Cahill are two of the most likeable characters around. And leave it to Howard to provide moments of hilarity and lots of truly hot sex! The mystery develops logically and ends appropriately. I have a whole new respect for 'butlers'! I only have a problem with two scenes: the nude wrestling and Sarah with the lamp. I don't object due to modesty - far from it. I do however, think both scenes are ludicrous! I keep seeing things sagging and swinging! It's not supposed to be THAT funny! Overall, a great romantic thriller with a grand ending. Nifty story. Well worth your time and $. Enjoy!"
4,Good book!,"Overall a very good book. The only problem I had was that Sarah seemed to have every skill there was. I know there are woman like that but to those of us who are just regular people it can be a little annoying. Sort of like watching ""Charlie's Angels""!"
3,"Good Book, But Something Definitely Missing","I am a huge Linda Howard fan. And I was expecting a great read with her latest book. As I started to read I was definitely intrigued by the underlying story. But where was the usual chemistry between the two main characters that are usually in every Linda Howard book? it seemed as though the detective Cahill was hardly attracted to Sarah. And the only time that they showed any sexual connection at all was during the love scence. I am a huge fan of other LH stories like After the Night, Heartbreaker, Kill & Tell, and Open Season. Although the suspense and intrigue is here, the romance definitely is not."
2,Nope nope nope,"She didn't have it this time. Having read most of her novels, she's a hit and miss, but this one was a miss. There wasn't the usual edge of your seat suspense as some of her others have. It dragged on and were a lot of characters thrown in there for...what reason??? Just to fill it up a bit??Linda Howard can get anyone hot and bothered, but is it getting routine for her. She has a real talent for the lusty sections, but it has been clouding over a bit lately."
2,Not the best...,"When I finished reading this book I had to double-check it was a new Linda Howard and not a 1980s reissue. The reason? It reads like a bad 1980s romantic thriller i.e. 'tough' heroine is as tough as jelly (especially were the hero is concerned), the hero is a macho jerk who spends 90 percent of the time distrusting the heroine and the other 10 percent having meningless sexual encounters with her and, as for the thriller element, there was no real plot or whodunnit element to the story. On finishing it one of my biggest questions was 'why?'. Why was it called a romantic thriller? It's neither romantic, in the true sense, or thrilling. An average book at best, and a poor example of Linda Howard's romantic thrillers, of which I am a fan. Please don't read this book first...instead try these LH books: Now You See Me, Kill and Tell, Mr Perfect and All the Queen's Men. Much, much, much better reads..."
3,Disappointing,"Linda Howard's earlier books (before she became really famous, I think!) were much more robust and delved into the personalities and motivations in her characters. Mr. Perfect and now Dying to Please seem very shallow. The dialog is not nearly as heartwrenching as some of her earlier work, and the spicy parts seem contrived, kind of forced into the work because they are now expected. Definitely don't pay full price for this one (I did and was disappointed...)"
4,Another Smash for Linda Howard,"As usual, Linda Howard builds excellent suspense and tension. Her characterization of Sarah and Cahill's personalities are great. Along with her other books of suspense, Linda delivers a great story!! Read this book, you won't regret it."
5,Very Pleased,"This is the BEST Linda Howard I've read, and I've read quite a few of her novels. I loved the psychological points of views of Cahill, Sarah and the killer (who was quite a lethal fellow!). I resonated with the romantic aspects, in terms of expectations. My eyes watered with the determination of Cahill to show Sarah how much he loved her towards the end. I thought the book was well-written and the plot was good. I, too, had a problem though with the ""make up"" sex. I thought Cahill took advantage of Sarah's shell-shocked body and demeanor. It was selfish. Other than that, it was a page turner.If you enjoy sex, murder and romance this is the book for you."
5,Dying for the Next One!,"Linda Howard is an excellent writer and doesn't disappoint with ""Dying to Please."" I love the bodyguard/butler concept. The female protagonist is interesting and fun. The dialogue the best. The plot excellent! The alpha male, well, alpha but earthy! I won't detail the book, as that's been done before, but suffice to say it's great!"
4,DYING TO SEE ALL PSYCHO KILLERS BANED FROM FICTION,"If you've seen my other reviews of Linda Howard books, you know I think she rocks. However, I can only give this one four stars because once again she has brought us another psycho killer. LH is not the only author guilty of this plot cop-out. I don't know about you, but I'd settle for some just plain old bad guys to create the necessary tension and damsel in distress rescue. The main hero and heroine were great and interesting, but alas - that darn old psycho killer shows up! Linda, you are better than this. And, again, please write another western. Okay, I'd settle for another Son Of The Morning partial period piece. It would be a nice change. Trust me!"
2,"I kept trying, but gave up halfway in...","I gave up reading this about halfway in. I admit I double-checked a couple of times while reading it to make sure that I wasn't reading a book of the same title by a new, inexperienced author. I thought maybe I had downloaded the wrong book due to the poor writing skills. The author included way too many irrelevant details in the narrative (down to the hair color of minor characters, as well as the temperature at various times of the day - all irrelevant to the storyline), as well as many other non-essential (and very distracting) details. There was very little action compared to the plodding narrative, plodding dialogue, and plodding plot; and after plodding through halfway and realizing that a skilled author should've covered all that (and more) in less than a chapter, and with much more oomph and tension, I decided that it just wasn't worth my time."
3,Ok Reading,I thought this book was ok. I love Linda Howard and read many of her books. This was not one of her best. I would read it if I had nothing better to read. I just did not care for the storyline.
5,Dying to Please = It Worked for Me!,"Simply astonshing. The clarity and colour of the author's words brought tears of confusion to my eyes. Page 57, in particular, was so chock-... full of memorable bits that I tore it out and keep it pasted to the inside of my car's windscreen so that I can can be entertained at stoplights or in heavy traffic on the by-pass. Who could forget such nuggets as"" ""Yeah, that's it. You're right!"" or ""Maybe tomorrow -- right now I have ricketts.""Splendid -- A MUST read!"
3,Not one of L.H.'s best books,"Usually I really like reading Linda Howard's books.I can't put my finger on it but there's just somethingmissing in the story between Cahill and Sarah.It's definitely not as good a read as ""Mr. Perfect""or ""Open Season""."
4,Dying to Please worth reading. 4 stars,"Recommend this book to females over twenty! Story line interesting though at times predictable! Love story with central character portraying a female s who is strong, determined, and can take care of herself . She is cool like a Jane Bond type! Kicks butt when necessary and can be sexy and totally into sex and love!"
2,Dying to Please,This book is just okay. Not exciting and sometimes predictible. I think she could have done a little better in the suspense factor. Ididn't care for it.
3,Barb101,I am only giving it 3 stars because it is similar to her other books and the ending is always what you expect. The book only holds your interest up to a certain point.
3,Just Okay For Me,"This book is romantic suspense, heavy on the relationship drama and light on the suspense. I loved some parts. The dialogue/banter between the two main characters had me chuckling at times. I liked both characters and the storyline was interesting, if not a bit predictable.Unfortunately, for me, too many things didn't work. I found the story dragged, with lots of repetitious inner thoughts about the merits of each character getting involved in a relationship with the other. I didn't actually see much of a relationship. The two characters only seemed to interact when having sex. Then, at the end when the killer is revealed, the story feels suddenly rushed. I didn't think the investigation aspect was well thought out or enacted. The last of several times that Sarah is considered a suspect verged on the ridiculous.Overall, the drawbacks took away from otherwise great writing and made this on okay read."
3,Still waiting...,"""Dying to Please"" is a little slow on the take off, but towards the end it gets a lot better. I'm still waiting on one of Howard's books to blow me away, but for right now she keeps me entertained enough to keep coming back for more."
2,Not believable,"I guess this novel would be termed a suspense-romance. There's no real mystery because we learn very early who the villain is. Unfortunately, the villain is one-dimensional.In fact, that's the problem with other characters. They have no depth. Many are stereotypes. The main character is too good to believe.The biggest flaw is that the plot and characters are not believable. The writer is not untalented, but this novel is not entertaining. Definitely wasn't worth my time."
3,"Okay, but not Open Season or Mr. Perfect","I, like many of the reviewers, LOVE Linda Howard. I have every intention of purchasing her next book as soon as it comes out. However, this book was not her best work, IMO. I loved the female lead but the male lead, I just never warmed up to him. Additionally, it felt like the killer was added on as an afterthought."
5,Read it twice to be sure!!,"I bought the book the day it went on the shelves. I was not disappointed this time. It seems Ms. Howard has returned to the style of writing for which she became famous. I believe the faithful readers of Ms. Howard will be happy with her latest book. Sarah Stevens is a likable heroine. She's competent, confident and sensitive. Cahill is the perfect compliment to Sarah. It's a good match. Enjoy!!!"
3,Another Linda Howard book pleaser,"Setting: Modern TimesAnother hero is named Tom. Linda Howard must like the name Tom a lot. It's a good love story with a touch of a mild murder mystery, but not one of her best works. It still has the classic love connection you can feel from reading the words."
4,Love This Writer & I Love Her 'Psycho Killer' Hehehe...,"... this is a wonderful story that I read one night when Fred (my husband) had to work all night...I threw a log on the fireplace and went crazy. The next thing I knew I had the beejesus scared out of me as Fred put his key into the front doorlock and tried to get in...The time went that quickly!I'm a huge fan of Ms. Howard and I love all her books!All of them are loaded with action, romance, and tons of suspensful intrigue!"
5,Worth the wait!,"For longtime fans of Linda Howard, this one was well worth the wait. After only good novels like ""Open Season"" and the collection ""Strangers in the Night"", Howard finally gives us a true 5 star performance with this one. I bought it the day it came out and finished it in just a few hours~I simply couldn't put it down! With a fresh perspective on a butler, Howard gives us Sarah Stevens, a much sought after buter who is worthy of her praise. She is strong, both emotionally and physically and fans of a strong and intelligent female character will cheer for her. Her male counterpart, Thomas Cahill is equaly appealing. He is Howard's typical Alpha male, but a believable one who readers will enjoy getting to know. If you liked ""Mr. Perfect"", then this one is for you! Don't bother waiting for paperback~you'll want this one in hardback!"
1,So hideously awful there are no words to describe,"I can't even begin to comprehend how a book this bad could even get published. I got the unabridged audiobook from my local library for my commute, and on tape 5 out of 8 I decided if I kept listening to it I'd have to drive into a tree to end my own misery. The characters are stupid and unbelievable. The murder that you can't quite care about gets buried in the terrible love story. NOBODY has this much internal dialogue about relationships. I felt like I had to be listening to the same tape over and over, because I kept hearing the same old crap. I have no idea how it ended, because I turned it off. Silence was a relief.A comment on the audio version: the woman reading the book was awful with her ridiculous fake southern drawl."
1,Pathetic,"Let me start by saying that I have every book Linda Howard has written and loved all of them except this one. I am finding it difficult to believe that Linda wrote this piece of garbage. There really is no story line and if I wanted gratuitous explicit sex I could find other books that do a better job. The ""heroine"" doesn't ever want to see the love of her life again but when he knocks on the door, she immediately has sex with him??? PULEEZE!!"
3,Missing something - and slightly creepy,"Sarah Stevens character was interesting because I'd never read anything about the life of a butler/bodyguard before. And Detective Cahill was cool, but not as well developed as Linda Howard's usual hero. I was happily enjoying the story until about 2/3 of the way through, but Linda did such a number on framing up the bad guy that I got really creeped out by him. Maybe if there would have been more to the story after the climax I wouldn't have finished the book with such a creepy feeling in my bones. It's worth a read, but this one's toward the bottom of my list of Linda Howard favorites."
2,I expected better too!,Wow - I can't believe all the 5 star ratings on this book. Makes me think I didn't read the same one as everything else. Definitely not one of LH better books. I found the plot to be rather simple and the characters just okay. The sex scenes were a little too explicit for my tastes plus the characters were in lust not love. It will be awhile before I buy another one of her hardcover versions. Reading this book felt like reading on auto-pilot.
5,The Perfect Butler?,"This is a fun book with people getting murdered every few days for no apparant reason, a cop that doesn't have much personality at first sight, but is to die for by the middle of the book. The heroine, Sarah Stevens is the best butler money can buy having had all the required butler training, AND being an expert in martial arts as well as a crack shot. AND she looks good. There is a catch though. Her employers are getting killed. The killer is actually stalking Sarah and has his own evil plans for her future. Natually Sara and the cop get together for some great times that stretch the imagination a bit but are great for a fantasy read."
3,Pleased me!,"I enjoy Linda Howard's books, and Dying to Please is no exception. Although there are some points to complain about, overall this was a fast, suspenseful and enjoyable read.Sarah Stevens is a butler/bodyguard to a wealthy retired judge. When she thwarts a robbery she is featured on a news program. And so the stalking of Sarah begins. In the interim Sarah has begun a romance with the police officer who investigated the burglary. A lot of twists and turns occur after Sarah's employer is murdered, and she becomes the prime suspect.My complaints are minor. I didn't like Cahill, the love interest, as much as I liked Sarah, and thought they were not a great couple. I also had problems with the stalker. I think he was presented as far to 'bland' to have hatched his diabolical scheme. Still the point of these type of books is not to think too much, just have fun. I had fun, the book was an easy and fast read, and I look forward to more by Ms. Howard."
4,Unique and steamy!,"I really liked this book, and am going to immediately look for more from this author! Linda Howard truly captured the emotions of her storyline, creating believable characters out of a sexy detective and a female butler/bodyguard. Both the romance and suspense elements were well-developed- and listening to this book at work was a guilty pleasure. I LOVED the teasing dialogue of the characters here, and truly hope this is the rule for Howard rather than an excellent exception.Downright erotic and fun reading. At LEAST four stars!"
4,A Good Linda Howard,Once again Linda Howard does it: writes a good romatic mystery that has just enough gore to hold us true gory mystery lovers. Ms. Howard's heroine is a butler/body guard and from there the story gets better. The villian is a kinky killer (yeah) and the hero is a good balance to the heroine (he can eat crackers in my bed). You will not be disapointed.
1,Dying to Please,"This book was very well written. The characters were well researched, and quite believable. I have truly enjoyed Miss Howard's books. I stumbled upon one of her books and picked it up not really knowing what to expect. I am now reading the fifth of many that she has written, and am looking forward to reading many more of her wonderfully written novels."
4,Dying to Please by Linda Howard,Lind. Howard never fails to hold my interestThis is an older book that I had missed ..Totally enjoyed itt
4,"Nothing deep, but very enjoyable","This is a very fast read. My major disappointment with this book is that the bad guy is introduced early and then he disappears for two-thirds of the book. He winds up not being a major character at all, so he is very sketchily drawn. Still, overall this a page turner with a lot to like."
2,Errors in the French section,"Beware if you intend to purchase or use this book !There are errors in some of the explanations in the French section.For example, on page 74, under the "" Structure in Paragraph ""it reads : "" The answer to 5 is (C) voulait.In Si clauses (clauses of condition) when the conditional is usedfor one verb, it MUST ALSO BE USED for the SECOND verb in the sentence.Clearly wrong !It is a pity that this book was not edited by specialists !I have not read the other sections."
3,A Winona Ryder Teen Movie,"This is the typical teen movie, but with the psychological twist most Winona Ryder movies have. By psychological, i mean there are times when the characters have traumas in their lives-normal people problems. This character-Dinky-has self esteem problems, and so do her parents(not with self esteem). Everyone in this movie has a problem and that's what I like. This movie mixes real life with a Cinderella twist (teen outsider gets popular cute guy). I reccomend this to any teen girl and maybe her boyfriend."
5,Hello,Use to watch it as a kid loved the movie and now wanted my kid to watch it too so i bought it.
1,Totally forgettable!,"Unless you check out this video at the library for free, you have been ripped off. It is strictly for the 13-year-old crowd of die-hard Ryder fans. Jeff Daniels seems to be embarrassed by his appearance in this piece of fluff. I can't really describe the plot, because there is none. I only regret that the lowest possible score is one star."
3,"Not bad, not bad!","Well, I got this video off eBay, not knowing what to expect. This ""acceptable"" movie is completely carried by Winona Ryder, with a surprisingly unsatisfying Jeff Daniels as backup. The story is OK, and the ending is touching, if a bit predictable. Winona is GREAT in this, and really does a great job, bringing a sense of wonder and a completely truthful teenage portrayal into this otherwise drowning movie."
5,"Roxy, came home!!",Got here fast!!!! I so love this movie!!! It's great to laugh and cry in one movie!! You can NEVER go wrong with a good 80's movie!
4,An odd girl in a small town,This is a really enjoyable movie about a misfit girl in a small town. Winona Ryder's character isn't quite right. She idolizes the only person that ever left town and became famous. Now the town is all aflutter because the famous Roxy Carmichael is coming back to visit. Probably a good date movie.
1,Battery dead after 2 months - Buyer Beware.,"I purchased this watch on July 26th. After two or 3 days of the second hand moving every 2 seconds, on Sept 27th the watched stopped. I looked in the manual and it states the battery should last for 4 years. But the manual states that since the battery is placed in the watch at the factory to test functions and performance of the watch. And, it may be less than the specified period. With that said this leads me to believe I purchased a watch that was could be 3 years and 10 months old.The watch was sold by Inventory Adjusters, Inc. through Amazon. Since it is over 30 days Amazon will not honor a return. The Certificate of Authenticity from Inventory Adjusters, Inc guarantees the watch for a period of 1 year to be free of defects. And the guarantee does not cover batteries."
5,Wonderful,In a small mountain town in Honduras teachers and school directors have chosen this great resource for their libraries. Students are motivated by searching their favorite topics. It should be on the shelves of all who are learning and living a second language.
3,Its nice,"I have been wanting this CD for such a long time, that my expectations were too high. Don't get me wrong, it is beautiful, and takes me back to times when cocktail music was the embodyment of a chic party. I just think that when you hear the soundtrack while watching the movie, it is way more charming.Still happy to have purchased it."
2,Thought it would be better...,"I ordered ""His California"" and I was a bit disappointed. It was okay, but I just thought it would be better based on the reviews that I read. It sounded a bit too commercial for me and like a bunch of extra songs that didn't do too well made into an album. Maybe Im just not a big enough Bobby fan and wasnt able to appreciate it as much as some of his other work."
3,VERY small,Looks big in the picture but this is Really small. It shows two kids in the picture b/c that must be all that it will hold. it easily folds over on itself when inflated. It did get a hole in it too but it didnt keep it from being inflated.
4,A Soujourn of Love,"A book of love poetry by Ms. Ve. Ester St. Obria Lyles, deserves a look from anyone who has ever been in love. Because it is one ""emotional roller coaster,"" that will have you looking back at love past, present, and how you divulge your love in the future. She touches on everything from first meetings to lovers cheating. Even touching on the guilt you feel when you are the one deviating outside of the love. Just makes one wonder how much of this book this young lady has lived. And how much is just pure and good literary skills. No matter what the catalyst was for such touching, personal, and pungent feelings, I advise all that have the gift of love to pick this one up. It's a good and easy read that will touch you in the most sensitive and emotional ways."
2,"Typical gore and dymentia form GWAR, but not their best work","Buy ""Scumdogs of the Universe"" instead. This CD is ok, but these guys have done better, and have had more creative moments."
3,It's adequate.,"The Spider's Lullabye isn't too bad, but I don't listen to it that often. I prefer The Eye and Abigail to this. I don't feel that The Spider's Lullabye is as creative as those ones. That aside, I still think it's good enough to be satisfying. My favorite songs are ""From the Other Side"" and ""Dreams."" I don't care for ""Room 17"" though; it's too long and not that interesting to begin with. The lyrics to this album are pretty cool. The guitar playing is impressive like on other albums from King Diamond. Andy La Roque is very talented and shreds with originality. I just wish that The Spider's Lullabye was more thought-provoking. It's still all right and has a good production. Worth a listen."
4,Another opera from the King,"Spider's Lullabye is a continuation of King Diamond's specialty: heavy metal opera concept albums. And King Diamond is good at what he does...it does not, in my opinion, rank quite as high as Them.Still, Spiders Lullabye is great album. Kings vocal is very special and definitely not for everyone. It is an acquired taste, but a taste worth acquiring. Don't let his looks scare you either. This is actually music on a high level.The story is definately not for arachnophobes, so be warned! It takes a while to get in to Diamond's world, but once you do, it will be a thrill. The musical craftmanship is still top notch.High quality all the way."
3,A little uninspired...,"...however I must admit that King Diamond is one of the most consistent song writers in heavy metal today. At the time this record was made, Mercyful Fate had been resurrected and King was splitting his time up between the two bands. This may have had to do with some of this album's lackluster moments. Later releases proved that King could in fact juggle both projects. But don't take my word for it. Buy it and decide for yourself."
2,Skip this one.,"There are a few decent songs, but this album is King's only miss. If you're a die hard King or Mercyful Fate fan you should have it, but there are FAR better albums. If you're a King fan and you haven't discovered Mercyful Fate, go explore their albums."
2,surprisingly mediocre,"Having been a fan of King's solo work since Abigail, I eagerly awaited each subsequent release and was never disapointed, that is until I heard this. Spider's Lullabye was a major let down, and I couldn't find a single song on it I liked. Unfortunately it marked the begining of a string of weak albums from King AND Mercyful Fate, with few bright spots. I still give his albums a chance, hoping to find a return to the melodic, hook-laden days of yore, but Spider's Lullaby broke my heart."
1,"This Is Almost As Bad As ""9""","SPIDERS'S LULLABY IS KING DIAMOND'S WORST ALBUM, NEXT TO NINE. IF YOU MUST BUY A KING DIAMOND ALBUMS, PICK A GOOD ONE LIKE FATAL PORTRAIT OR ABIGAIL. THOSE ONES WERE RECORDED IN A MORE PROFESSIONAL MANNER. IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME, JUST GO TO ANY KING DIAMOND FAN PAGE AND CLICK ON THE POLLS AND SEE WHAT THE OTHER FANS THINK!"
3,"""Here comes another one......""","Four years later after ""The Eye"", King & Andy with new members of the band dish out ""The Spider's Lullabye"", an a-typical Diamond album, which might be the strangest story line King has put out. Musically, it sounds very similar to many different Diamond songs. Herb Simmonsen's guitar playing wouldn't catch my attention until ""Voodoo"", and La Rocque is brilliant as ever. Not an epic album, most of the songs, with the exception of the last four, are all self contained stories. But I always felt that ""Lullabye"" was a follow-up to ""The Eye"". The ""eye"" is mentioned in ""From the Other Side"", which leads me to believe all the songs are related experiences of other people, just like ""The Eye"". I'm sure a lot of Diamond fans might have been disappointed, but it really isn't that bad. Certainly not to be overlooked!"
5,Rockin' good time with The Lost Rock!,"My daughter has loved this show since she was under a year. She still may not understand how to spell yet, but she loves to dance to the songs and laughs at many of the characters. From tooth to fish, my daugher is soaking informaiton up, and loving it. Her favorite is 'The Lost Rock'. I agree, it has the best songs to dance to. I just wish there were more videos available. I'll watch those lions over Barney any day."
2,disappointing,"If you intend to use this video while walking on a treadmill, it may be beneficial. Otherwise, it is very annoying: There are 3 exercisers who walk at a differnet pace. One on the floor and 2 on treadmills. It is very difficult to keep a constant pace as the camera shifts from one to the other and accordingly, the pace changes. The idea of using weights while on a treadmill is fine, but why do it? It is not a very useful muscle strengthener and the cueing is practically non-existent. I wish I knew why the participants seem so annoyingly happy all the time, while I had a hard time following them.I have scores of videos which I use daily. This is one of the worst I came across. Don't buy it if you don't intend to use it with a treadmill!"
3,5 star series....0 stars for the marketing ploy....leaving off commentaries!,"Hi Folks,before you start getting on me for not rating Gunsmoke 5 stars...its the series on DVD i'm dissing...not the show.I am shocked to see that the episodes on this disc that were previously available Don't have the commentaries. Obviously CBS/Paramount are going to force diehard fans to buy the 50th Anniversary set plus the Directors set plus the season sets to get all the goodies. I don't mind the extras like cast appearances on the Mike Douglas show to be left off..but leaving off commentaries (like James Arness from the opening episode) really stinks.This is still a very good set....if the other versions didn't already exist I'd be rating it a 5plus."
3,gotta watch with a fellow GS fan!,"never saw this before now... am so amazed at how it is Westward Ho's Melrose Place... women are such victims and integral to plot complexities, I am intrigued, love the slow pace and have come to welcome the regular characters as family, always wondering if the Marshall is dating Ms. Kitty and only saw one episode where she hits on him, whoa.... I am annoyed with Weaver's attempt to show dead leg syndrome like Frasier's dad or Usual Suspects Kaiser Sosack (sp)... just not needed for character depth, soooo fun to see the early career intros of the likes of Cloris Leechman with the incredible legs, and always guessing who is the now famous guest surprise character, highly recommend for a slower pace of drama and how the saloon girls wear '60s heels, and well, it is a very comfortable excitement of personal relationships, gunfights, bad guys, heroes, drunkards, crazy women, Indians, I guess it spans much more than any other western show of it's time as well as current."
5,GunSmoke Rules,I bought this for my hubby who LOVES Gunsmoke. We are both extremely happy with this. The product got here right on time. We couldn't be happier. Wonderful. Many hours of entertainment.
5,Gunsmoke - The First Season DVD's review,"Fast delivery. Excellent quality DVDs. Good Price. Watching Matt Dillon (James Arness) and the rest of the Gunsmoke cast, brings classic TV show back into your home to watch at your convenience."
5,Gunsmoke The First Season,"We thoroughly enjoyed this TV show years ago, so we were very pleased to see it come out in DVD's."
4,thank you,I ordered this product as a gift for my dad. We received it in a timely manner and the gift was exactly what we wanted. Thank you I will order from Amazon again.
5,Gunsmoke-The First Season,Nice to see the shows with Dennis Weaver as Chester. They are the ones I grew up watching every Saturday night. Quality is great and price was right
3,Totally Contrived,"This movie was embarrassing. It was the kind of film that my dad could have walked in on at any point and said ""What is this?"" and I'd be falling over myself to excuse it. I think the beginning was the best part. Very authentic regarding the cowboy way of life. But as the movie progressed it felt pretty contrived. You have your typical crazed and vengeful preacher-type, your sassy yet ignorant female type, and a kid thrown in to give you the warm-fuzzies.There were a few amusing parts, but I was still stuck on the question: What the heck is a ""rawhider""? When the crazies show up near the beginning of the film the cowboys spit out the word ""rawhider"" like it's a curse, which they never define. And the ending! Will Penny did the right thing... but for all the wrong reasons!"
1,Will Penny,"Wish I COULD have viewed this video! It had a ""region error"", wouldn't play. Amazon refunded price of DVD, but I had to pay to send it back. No longer order DVD's from Amazon. I do love this old movie. Haven't seen it in years. Do recommend the movie, but don't know where you can buy a working copy."
4,Near Classic,"For sheer realism about the life of the range hand in the mid to late 19th century West this fine film is unsurpassed. It's unfortunate that writer and director Tom Gries didn't realize how good it was and leave out the religious maniac introduced as a contrived villain. It's the only flaw, but a major one. Charlton Heston, Lee Majors, Anthony Zerbe and Joan Hackett are marvelous. Very similar in flavor to ""The Wild Rovers,"" Blake Edwards picture made three years later."
4,Heston's lone cowboy,"This minor classic Western, totally ignored by Paramount when it was released in '68, stands as one of the best performances the late Chuck Heston ever gave even over ""Major Dundee"" which he wrote off as a fiasco in an interview he gave. He should be proud of this film because unlike many Westerns of its time, this one is more character-driven than like say ""Silverado"" which sacrifices character development for action (Lawrence Kasden could take a pointer from this flick). The late Joan Hackett is also excellent as the lone woman who takes in Heston after he is beaten by the crazen Donald Pleasance & his family (Bruce Dern, etc) and learns to love again as she falls for this lonely, 50'ish cowboy. Tom Gries directed with a sure hand and the outdoor photography is fantastic. This western along with Peckingpah's ""Ride the High Country"" stands as one of the true classics of this genre. Whole heartedly recommended for Heston enthusiasts and western buffs!!"
4,Best realistic western before Lonesome Dove,"One can see why C. H. loved making this movie. He SO fit into the character, one wonders why it was so hard for him to shed the Moses/Ben Hurimage. Much care was made by the producer and director to create a realistic western, and STILL have a very interesting story about a very interesting character. When some people talk about great western riders in movies (Ben Johnson is counted as one of the best, and he's in the movie), they shouldn't leave out old C. H. He looks like a true cowboy in all his riding scenes, and he was a great rider."
3,Alive/Rare Junk by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band,"This is an album from some live appearances. Not bad , but I ususally don't like live appearance albums. I don't like the commentary between songs etc. Most of the songs are good, but this album is just O.K. in my book. I'm a Dirt Band fan, but this is far from their best album."
4,I'm sold on Amazon and the Art of Selling,"I first read this book when I was in the executive search business and it was instrumental in increasing my effectiveness at selling and developing clients. Tom Hopkins techniques and suggestions are timeless and well worth the read. Although dated, this book is easy to read and the sales techniques recommended can be applied by many different professions.How to Master the Art of Selling"
5,Avid Reader,"Great sales book! This book is a one for your collection of sales books; real thorough and precise on how to become a top salesmen. For anyone who rather get paid for their efforts than their time, this book is highly recommended."
5,this book doubled my sales in one month,my boss gave me this book when i was struggling with sales his instructions were to leave it somewhere and read it in bits .i left it in my bathroom and read it on the throne . my sales doubled the first month and i never had an easier time closing customers . tom taught me how to stay out of my own way and allow the customer to buy my product (for their reasons not mine)
4,One of the few books that covers soft skills well,"I've been happy with this book. If you're looking to touch the basics or soft skills I recommend it. However it is written mainly for sales that involve meeting prospects in person. Most of my sales are over the phone and online demonstrations. Even with that being said, this is still a great book for new/colder sales reps."
2,Half the Book is lame,"The book is ok , didn't tell me anything that i didn't know. Nearly half of the book was just trying to get you to read and to tell you how good this book is . Also , what i got out of it was , ""Try and Try again, and you will know the trick""."
4,Updated version worth the money,"I first bought ""How to Master the Art of Selling"" by Tom Hopkins in 1993 and then recently purchased the updated version because I am re-entering the world of sales and wanted to see how the author had updated/revised his approach.In my opinion, Hopkins' strongest point is the attention to preparation. He outlines many specific scripts and strategies that are easily adapted to various situations. This is the best ""how to"" book I have come across.While the fundamentals of selling are still basically the same (perserverence, follow-through, shameless self promotion etc.) the author did a nice job of bringing his approaches into the 21st century.The book is well worth the money, both for the updates and the re-read."
2,Lacks Detail,"This manual covers too broad a vehicle spectrum and lacks detail necessary to do a serious repair with confidence. Diagrams are spotty in their coverage and references to obscure tools like ""noid lights"" are not explained."
2,limited,this was the closest manual I could find for my '96 Isuzu oasis-unfortunately it did not address the reasons I ordered it-repair of cruise control-defroster & heating controls - I'm always amazed by some of these DIY manuals that go into rebuilding an engine but overlook many simple maintanace items-I would go to the OEM service manual for anything complicated-I just needed a clarification on some issues so as not to have to pay someone else for diagnostics. it's an OK reference for tune-up specs & wiring diagrams-would have liked better coverage of diagnostic codes.
4,"they are great,","I saw the five blind boys of alabama in '96 at the philly folk fest. They were awsome, granite you won't get the same feeling listening to this cd, but it brings back so many wonderful feelings. the cd is exellent my 1 month old daughter loves the cd and so do I!"
5,The Best,I tried the glue felts work for furniture that aren't moved a lot by for Dinning Chairs these are the best to use
2,These get knocked off,"The ""felt pad type"" will not survive use on a tile floor. They get caught in the tile grout-lines, and get torn off. I recommend the solid plastic type for use on tile."
1,Felt pads do not stay on chair legs,I have used many felt pads for the bottom of chairs and these are the only ones I have ever used that come off the legs easily. The felt is good quality but the poor attaching quality is a detraction.
4,Schumanns' Ghosts,"My favorite aspect of this album (besides the superb playing) is the wonderful choice of repertoire. Virtually all of the pieces performed in the selection are overlooked works that in the hands of Yael Weiss are communicated to the listener as delightful masterpieces. Her extensive knowledge of Schumann sings through her performances (as well as in the prose of her poetic, colorful liner notes). What a pleasure it was to listen to works of Schumann which I knew not existed, particularly three of his late fugues (Op. 126) and his ""Ghost"" Variations. Ms. Weiss' playing is full of wide ranging colors, bringing to life the duality of Schumann's alter-egos Florestan and Eusebius (particularly in the Humoreske). She provides clean lines and textures throughout. A highly insightful pianist Ms. Weiss is indeed. I recommend this recording to any lover of Schumann's music."
4,A superb and sublime quartet setting.,"Michael Weiss is yet another underrated and relatively unknown piano player in New York. This is a superb and sublime album, which is greatly enhanced by the virtuosity of Eric Alexander's powerful tenor. Weiss played for 10 years with Johnny Griffin and has mastered the art of mixing with a strong horn. To his credit, Weiss really lets Alexander dominate the album. Weiss's playing is linked to the great bop masters, like Bud Powell, and when he solos the piano sings. It is too bad that he has not put out an album in more than 10 years. This album is a must-have for the Summer and is well worth the extra dollars as an import. You will not be able to take it off your CD player."
5,funny,This movie is full of action and comedy. If you like comedy and karate this is the movie for you. I recommend this movie for Ure collection.
1,Absolutely an insult to the First Movie.,"Have you seen over the top?This movie was an abject horror. I was never so disappointed in a movie since Red Sonja. I felt betrayed and hurt. The child actor from from ""Over the Top"" (Sylvester Stallone, 198-who cares) reprises his role as the stupid kid that hits his head and limps to the boxing / karate ring to cheer on his favorite hero. What a travesty. The first movie was so good I rented it 10 times. This so called second is no better than William Shatner's directoral debut in Star Trek Five, The Final Frontier, a movie I saw in the theater because I had to. That video now sits amongst the Island of Misfit movies still in the wrapper. Shame. Shame. What ever went so wrong? And why is it so difficult for me to find a copy of my favorite comedy ever produced, "" They call me Bruce."" One can only ponder. One can one only ponder. Oh, the madness... oh, the madness."
5,Genius,"My guess is this movie is going to be HILARIOUS. I recommend watching the prequel first though. Still waiting for ""They Still Call Me Bruce"" to come out on DVD before I buy/watch it."
5,nancy drew the teen modle mystery,"This mystery takes place in chicago.Nancy is the major character,Of chors she would be because she is the detective! Her best friend Bess is one of the major characters too!The minor character is Cindy who got kidnapped. The problem occurs when Nancy and Bess go to chicago. To see there friend Cindy who is a modle. But when they show up to the shoot Cindys missing!! Ater that Nancy and Bess go on a wild gosse chase to find out the unexpeted.The most sacrist part of the story is we Nancy is waiting to get on to the subway when someone slashes her jacket with the a razor-blade!The stroie ends in away you didn't think possible!"
4,Helping out,"First of all I just want to say this is sad that no one can make a little effort to write a review on one of the best series. Anyways, I liked this book. It had everything like all ND mysteries do. Action, adventure, romance (sorta) and mystery (duh)."
3,Basic Banking,"I purchased this book to gain a better understanding of the industry as a whole. It served it's purpose! I am new to working in banking and I will have to learn how my bank operates, but now I can ask the right questions to speed up the process."
2,"Nice looking watch, poor delivery","Ordered 2 watches few days ago. Watch looks nice and the pricing is very attractive for a watch with perpetual calendar. Watch band looked a little bit wider than it looked in the pictures. Delivery of watches by WatchGrabber was very poor, one watch was DOA and the other one had scratches/dents on the band. I've had much better experience with direct orders from Amazon."
5,Ruthless Trust: The Ragamuffin's path to God,Very good book to be encouraged to form a ruthless trust in everything we do.
3,Chapter 11,"A great and easy to read book on trust and learning to live in the ""now."" I recommend it."
5,Oil moisture spray,"If you like gardenias you will love this scent. Very soft and subtle. For dry skin the spray is perfect, not too heavy or sticky, but gives a silky feeling which feels ""just right"" for bare arms in summer."
1,Way too much money for you what you get!,"I can't believe I actually bought this product. This product is super expensive and there are million other products that I could have purchased. I purchased it thinking it would help me with my dry skin and smell nice in the summer. I took a shower and put this on my elbows and knees for over a week, every morning when I woke up my both my knees and elbows were still dry and I needed more moisturizer. On top of that, when I spray the glow, I wound up choking from the spray. Not a good purchase at all! Never again."
2,Too flowery and strong,This item was not what I expected--it is very flowery and strong. I read the reviews that said it was light and clean but I found it too be too strong for my taste. I am returning this perfume.
3,Scent is too subtle,"I love the scent but this spray doesn't capture it as well as the roll-on oil. I'd recommend the oil over this if you'd like more of a fragrance but if you're into a subtle scent, this is perfect."
1,Ugh... more of the same,"The album description claims this sounds like VNV, Apop, and Covenant... and while it is clear that this is what Glis would LIKE to sound like, they fall way short of the mark. Production has thankfully improved a bit from the tepid Extract release, but ultimately, the songs suffer from over-simplicity and unimaginative arrangements you've likely heard a hundred times before if you're familiar with this type of music at all. It's been done before and it's been done a lot better. What doesn't improve on this release are the lyrics and vocals. Gradeschool level lyrics are sung in an awkward, constipated tone which have an almost 'Weird Al' tone to them. The guest female vocals that appear are equally amateurish. To be honest, I thought Extract was a stronger release... this album sounds like they are trying to ape the sound of bands they like without shaping any real identity of their own."
1,Not very good,"Boring music, bad singing, more boring music, some bad guest female singing, just bad & boring all around. This sounds like some guy in his garage, avoid this I wish I had."
5,The future is Glis!,"Stunning programming and excellent songwriting craft combined with the moody vox of Shaun F. makes this an absolutely essential album. Check out Resolution for the biggest ass kicking ever! Hypertension is ace. For fans of Icon of Coil, Assemblage23 etc.Highly recommended.I can't wait for Nemesis, out early 2005."
4,Flexible solution for Home Theater Wiring,"Although it's just the face plate, the two sections together give 12 ports that can fit over a dual gang low voltage box. I have four speaker connections (4 x 2 ports each) plus coax for aatellite and antenna (2 more ports) and one for cat5/phone, leaving me with one spare.The title says 'right end section', but actually, there is no 'left end section'. Two of these 'right-end' pieces go together. It's a matter of flipping the face plates so that the male connector tab fits into the female slot on the other plate. They snap neatly in place.If you're bothered by having a seam between the two face plates, then pass on this one.My only complaint is that I think I overpaid for shipping from Smarthome. In total, $13 for both plates and shipping is excessive. Home Depot used to carry these 6-port sectional plates, but seem to have discontinued that...or at least at my local store they did."
4,Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay at his best,"I ran into Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay's work accidentally in college, while looking for Tagore's work. First, I picked up a short stories book called ""A Strange Attachment and Other Stories."" I really enjoyed reading it. Later, I found out about Pather Panchali and its popularity in Bengal and World Cinema (credit to Satyajit Ray). Pather Panchali portrays traditional village life-style in India; which lacks wealth and education for majority of the people in the village. Pather Panchali conveys struggle faced by Horihor and his family due to lack of wealth.I am almost done reading Pather Panchali, but I have already order the sequel ""Aparajito."""
3,The forefather of minimalist grunge guitar,"I simply love Lightnin's electric guitar playing. He's like a sprightly John Lee Hooker when he plugs in. I really like this album even though I know I ""shouldn't""! It's a low-budget wonder. Lightnin' stretches out in this incredibly slow-granding way with tunes like ""Brand New Automobile"" and ""Mister Charlie II"". I play this album often because it is so innocuously enjoyable."
3,Simple to follow.,This video is very effective. I lost about a full dress size while doing this video only 3 times a week. It can be an excellent add on for your other workouts (so it doesn't get stale).
2,Not what I was hoping for.,This video gives an okay workout but the video quality isn't that great and Denise is so cheesy it makes me gag.
3,Where Do They Come From?,"I had a hard time with this purchase. The Company that I ordered the tape from wasn't the name on either of the tapes that showed up at my home. So, you see, I received an extra tape that I didn't order. The tape that came first was not in the best condition. The second one came about 2 weeks later.(I had only received one confirmation) The Amazon employees gave me a $25. certificate towards my next order. We'll see how the next ordering goes as I have had excellent service up until this time."
3,"Not as good as John R. Neill, but as good as Baum & Thompson","Well, I enjoyed the movie, but am not so sure about the book. The characters are not as funny, nor as real, nor as well-developed as in the other authors' books, but this is a workmanlike treatment of what was just an okay screenplay. If you've seen the movie and can relate each character to the on-screen persona, then it's acceptable, even fun. If you haven't seen the movie, probably not."
3,"googd book,but vindge could do better","i always loved the movie retutn to oz,and this movie novelizatin is one of the best i have ever read but...it is simply not the same land of oz. the characters are much too different than the original and i would hate to see what vindge would have done if she wrote the story herself instead of novelizing it from the movie.return to oz the movie had the oz magic but this novel based on it rather stole the innocence that l.frank baum had intended in his original books."
3,Ty Tabor - 'Moonflower Lane' (Metal Blade) 3 1/2 stars,"'Moonflower Lane' is quite a treat for all King's X fans as we get a chance to check out guitarist Ty Tabor's solo work.I'm an average King's X fan as I found this CD to be a good piece of work.Ty had apparently spent some serious time and effort assembling this disc.Tunes I thought made an impression were ""Island Sea"",""Without You"",""Another Day"" and ""Hollow Eyes"".Good heavy rock release.Do check it out when you can."
3,Guitarist from King's X!,"I should point out right away that I love King's X. The first 5 cd's anyways. Ty Tabor is a huge part of that. His guitar playing is really excellent. Some times very complex but always musical. Ty's cd's to me sound like lost beatles tracks(A good thing!). Some of the better songs, to me, are:(I Do, live in your house, her palace, another day). Pick this up if you like melodic hard rock that is inspired by the beatles. His other solo cd's are great as well. He is also in a band called jelly jam that is a bit more progressive, with some truly excellent musicians(John Myung, Rod Morgenstein)..."
1,Worthless,"I add to the previous reviewers - This product is Worthless. Mine will charge and run a camera for a Very Short time, then fall flat. Alternatively, I can charge it up and leave it for a time and it will go flat with no use at all. Defective. Waste of Time and Money. Buy something else."
1,Not good,"I bought this product for my brother's Kodak small digital camera. It takes him not more than 20 photos before the battery dies! Absolutely unacceptable.Although I always buy stuff from Amazon, this is the first time ever I don't accept a product at all...Regards,Wesam Al Nasr"
1,Trash!,"Didn't work when I got it. Turns out the plug was bad. It wouldn't come on unless I held it in. So, I sent it back to them and got it back 3 months later (supposedly fixed but I threw it away anyway). I already had another charger (Energizer)."
3,Of historical interest only,"Shakarim, nephew of the great Kazak philosopher Abay, wrote this book at the beginning of the 20th century. Although intended as a scientific work, it does not stand up to modern scientific standards. It is mainly a compilation from older sources, other scientific works, and oral traditions (which are the most interesting, as they probably cannot be found elsewhere). Its only interest is as a source for information to scientists interested in the history of Central Asia, who will be able to separate fact from fiction and myth, and as a source for the history of the development of historical science in Central Asia."
2,Extremely accurate watch,"I got this watch for Christmas, and set it to the naval obervatory time at http://www.time.gov/. One month later, it continues in lock step, exactly accurate. It's also a very good looking timepiece."
5,True Christmas Spirit,This is a wonderful book that embraces the true meaning of Christmas. Subtle humor and a heart-warming story. Highly recommend this book.
1,Living in Infamy,"Would anyone who has actually ""used the book to its fullest extent"" be living in Milwaukee? C'mon, _The Necronomicon_, if it does indeed exist would be useless and unreadable; it is supposed to be a ""book of the dead"" for a race of ancient gods. It is FICTIONAL, moreso than even the Bible. Lovecraft and his ilk created it and the Cthulhu mysthos based on alleged books of sorcery."
5,"looked on net,,i found this","The Necronomicon was written in Damascus in 730 A.D. by Abdul Alhazred......A Latin translation was made in 1487 (not in the 17th. century as Lovecraft maintains) by a Dominican priest Olaus Wormius. Wormius, a German by birth, was a secretary to the first Grand Inquisitor of the Spanish Inquisition, Tomas de Torquemada, and it is likely that the manuscript of the Necronomicon came into his possession during the persecution of Spanish Moors (""Moriscos"") who had been converted to Catholicism under duress and did not exhibit the necessary level of enthusiasm for the doctrines of the Church. ....."
1,The entire book (less preface) is in arabic,"I must wonder why so many of the reviews seem to miss this point: The text itself is NOT english, it is entirely in arabic. Only the preface is in english and of little value. I can only assume the other reviews are refering to the english edition which THIS is not. The english edition, although not ""ancient"" makes a rather interesting read."
4,Normal people (i type this with a grin),"I read a review of this book that stated ""what kind of normal person would be able to read this"" (or something to that direct effect). I must simply say that this book, in EITHER FORM, are not for the ordinary or normal. They contain information about the rituals of the walks and different seals along with information about the Necronomicon, which is a serious matter. The vast majority (perhaps there are some few others who come from a certain bloodline) who order this publication are young children who want to test some sort of ""witchcraft"" (as i've heard it called with such ignorance). Simply said, the untranslated version is just as good as the translated and cleared version. There's a reason he was called the Mad Arab. Thank you for your time."
1,Junk - just a gimmick,"Packaged as a plain vanilla paperback, written in fake arabic - first couple of pages are unique, after that a set of 16 pages are copied over and over to fill the volume. This is something I might pay fifty cents for at a garage sale as a novelty. What really makes me mad - having paid $19 plus shipping -is that there was nothing in the item description when I was shopping on Amazon clearly stating there is no part of the text of the book that is actually readable by anyone, anywhere on this planet."
3,Note:,"Necronomicon, as I share with many fellows aound the world, is the type of Myth that came with either lack of infos or culture, and/or the need of unique pieces of book, stories, unusual... Idea came from HP LOVECRAFT, a legendary science fiction writer, who create this legendary book, talking about black magic, of a supposed unknown civilisation. Lovecraft also wrote a book on Houdini, another fiction in the Pyramids of Egypt. HR Giguer, designer of Alien (the movie), Ph. DRUILLET, drawing artist, designer, and others, made valuable presentations, designs of the Necronomicon, fiction book.This one is another good presentation, keeping the legend, and the ambiguity. Great."
3,Research before you write,"Just to clarify for some of you:H.P. Lovecraft made up the word Necronomicon for use in his short stories that he wrote (mostly while living in Rhode Island in the 1920's and 30's). He freely gave this info out in many letters that he wrote to acquaintances during that period (many of which can be found on-line now as well). Abdul Alhazred is a pseudonym that Lovecraft used when he first began writing at age 5! Also, if you really want to prove it to yourself, even a brief look at Babylonian mythos will show that the book has no basis in truth. Lovecraft never intended the book to be made as a hoax, but it has grown over the years into it's current creation. Enjoy the the book for what it is, but don't forget it is fiction, not a handbook for worshippers passed down through the centuries."
1,This is so bad!,"What is this? This perticular version of Necronomicon is the worst. First of all it is written in a ancient language called Duraic. What averege person can read that? Secondly after close examination you will find that it is the same eight pages printed over and over again, with a slight alteration every second repetition(it's even the same alteration every repetition). No, stay away from this one if you want something you can read and use. The Simon version is much better. An it works! The only reson any one would want to by this one, is to have a complete collection of everything published about the ""NECRONOMICON""."
1,E-gads,"Lets be honest here people. Howard Phillips Lovecraft INVENTED the necronomicon in September of 1922 as a literary tool to enrich several of his FICTIONAL works. This book is an obvious tactic to grift impressionable fools. If you'd like to believe that the power of the universe can be harnessed to your whim, then go right ahead, but don't waste your time on obvious hoaxes. If you'd like to read a few REAL titles instead of this poorly conceived abomination then I can recommend the following:Malleus Maleficarum and Compendium Maleficarum Francisco M. Guazzo;Ars Magna et Ultima, Raymond Lully;De Lapide Philosophico, Johannes Trithemius;Key of Wisdom, Artephius;Thesaurus Chemicus, Roger Bacon;Turba Philosophorum, Guglielmo Grataroli;De Furtivis Literarum Notis, Giovanni Battista della Porta;The Daemonolatreia, Remigius;Good luck finding them!"
5,If you don't understand don't read!,"This is a book that is based on something that is old as time! If you think that it is fiction then you are sadly mistaken. It means that you do not fully understand. I personally have used the book to its fullest extent. It is something that should not be played with especially if you are just starting out. I do not recommend this book to the average witch or someone who wishes to ""just try it""! This book is not something that you just read like a story book."
3,"Good for completists, not terribly useful otherwise","I just want to point out to everyone that aside from the preface, there is nothing in english. The entirety of the Necronomicon text is in a psuedo-arabic script referred to as ""duriac"", and except for a few differing pages at the beginning and end, the rest is just ""filler"" that repeats every 8 pages (physical pages... or 16 ""numbered"" pages). It's an obvious hoax, and the authors have admitted as such from what I hear. Nevertheless, it can be a good purchase for Cthulhu-Mythos and Lovecraft completists, and it looks real enough that you can freak out your friends, or use it as a LARP prop or halloween item. I'm satisfied with my purchase, but it's important to know what you're getting before you spend your money. My understanding is that one of the major reasons this was created in the first place was to have a Necronomicon on record at the Library of Congress. :)"
1,Not that I expected to get the actual Necronomicon but,"at least I thougth I'd get an interesting book that the author had put some work into. Am I the only one who have noticed that, except for the preface and a few pages at the beginning and the end of the book, there's only 8 DIFFERENT pages repeating throughout the book?!"
1,Waste of Money,This book is all in an Arabic language with the only English text being the preface by L. Sprague De Camp .
1,Deceptive Selling Practices,"I at least thought the book would be written in English. It isn't, nor is it written in any known language, so there is no way to translate the book. I know it is a work of fiction, but why not a work of fiction in English? Why wasn't this little piece of information given to the customer? No one in there right mind would bother to purchase a book written in a make believe language. I'm disappointed ..."
1,On a point of information...,"I have little to add to the generally well formed arguments showing the Necronomicon to be a fiction, save to say that Abdul Alhazred is not even a proper arabic name, just something arabic-sounding invented by Lovecraft."
5,Fixing America's Schools for Good,"A real eye-opener, this very well-written and powerfully argued book finally helped me understand whyurban public schools never seem to have enough moneyto educate our children despite repeated national and local efforts to change that. Ms. Segal contends that waste and abuse are the primary culprits and offers thorough and persuasive documentation that this is indeed true.Because she concludes that the problem is withpathological systems, not people, she spends a good quarter of the book discussing how to overhaul the systems.The suggestions are overwhelmingly intelligent, inspiring, and above all, realistic.This book is a must-read for anyone looking for concrete and specific ways to improve our educational system."
4,A really nice guide to statistics for linguists,"Although not too recent, this book is still a valuable textbook for students and researchers in the field of linguistics who are interested in the statistical analysis of linguistic data.The introduction ""Why do linguists need statistics?"" is clear and motivating. The 15 chapters provide an overview on statistical inference, probability, ANOVAs, linear regression, and more, in a clear and precise fashion."
3,"this book was published in 1986, not 2003!","This is a very thorough book, and quite useful, but TAKE NOTE, SHOPPERS! It's more than 20 years old. The product information provided by Amazon is misleading. The 2003 publication date reflects when it was ""transferred to digital printing"" as indicated only on the inside cover of the book. The book itself was copyrighted in 1986, when Michael Jackson was still cool, computers were new, and people were still doing stats by hand or on calculators. I'm sure it's a good reference, but it doesn't have the latest info. on how to use current software or recent developments in the field of statistics. Don't be fooled by the 2003 publication date."
4,A great selection,Stoney is a great example of Texas/Red Dirt talent and the Live at Billy Bob's series recordings are excellent in quality and talent! A great buy!
5,Love Stoney Larue!!,"I ordered this cd with high expectations, and I wasn't disappointed with the product when it arrived. It arrived on time and in good condition. Another good shopping experience with Amazon!!"
4,Good product but the Velcro can be made more stickier,It works well with the added screws but the provided self-adhesive stopped being sticky after several attempts. It should have been made stronger.
1,10 pairs...all the wrong size!,"I ordered ten pairs of diabetic socks for my blind father and they were marked the right size, but were all wrong in the box. He is not able to return the two pairs that he opened because they are considered ""used"" and I was told that we had to pay a restocking fee as well as return shipping. He is out about $30.00 already, without the restocking fee! No way to treat a blind vet on a fixed income!"
5,I know the pain.,"I too, am so good I don't have to brag.But, nobody is better than Shel! Thirteen of the funniest songs around. From 'Ever Lovin' Machine', to the anti rascim ballad, 'Yowsah', to the pinnacle of anti-war tune 'Testing The Bomb'.There is none better!"
1,Ms. McClaine Needs Christianity. +,"Ms.McClaine needs Christianity because without having Christianity in ones life, one is simply lost. A person may read alot of books, travel the world, have alot of friends, but still long for something more, and that something more is having Christ in your life. New Age, and Scientology as well as the other religions out there only provide false hopes, and in the end they have no Salvation. McClaine needs Christ in her Life.I recommend that she watch Jack Van Impe Presents on TBN."
5,6 stars,"Unfortunately we have no more stars to give this book. It changed my life completely, for the better. Shirley has the ability to bring into words the answer to a lot of questions. Reincarnation, the logic of it all and the delightfull way it is written, makes us realize that everything around us has a purpose and it is up to us what we do with it.""If I am going to be a better person, why not start right away!"" Even after you have read a lot on the subject, this book should not lack in your library."
4,GREAT book!,Very well written book with a great flow.. I was even more amazed that I actually traveled the same road that Shirley did in Peru.. SEVERAL TIMES! I only wish I read this book prior to that lol
5,Thoroughly Enjoyable Read,"I very much enjoyed this book. And now that I have read it, I love Shirley MacLaine. The book seemed to me to be so honest, straightforward, and courageous. I applaud her for writing it and I loved reading it. Nancy Nelson Las Vegas"
2,an interesting read but not mind shattering!,I got this book on the recommendation of a friend who considers it to of great significance to them.Although it is intersting it does not really say much that is/has not been said by other authors.It is worth a read though.I was dissappointed becuse I expected more about Peru and the Andes!
2,Not so much out on a limb as clutching at straws.,Not so much 'Out On A Limb' as 'Clutching At Straws'. Enough said!
3,Very used,I wish I would have seen a picture of this before I bought it. Must have had a 5 pack a day smoker in the house or room for many years
1,astonishing,It is astonishing how far into idiocy a credulous individual can sink. The author's uncritical acceptance of the preposterous is almost beyond belief. I recommend the book only as a study in human gullibility and the deleterious effects of irrational thought.
1,*sigh*,"When I was a mere tad, I had the worst crush on Ms. MacLaine, primarily on the strength of her performance in ""The Apartment"" with Jack Lemmon.How it now saddens me that she didn't receive electroshock therapy in time!"
4,"Very, very interesting!","I got this book in my hands ""by the way"", but it changed my way of thinking very much. The biggest change was the way to think about myself - as a playfull, spiritual beeing, who I really am. Now I wonder if I really got this book in my hands ""by the way"" or was it ment to be?"
3,Nice Mats for the money,"Purchased these just before Christmas. The mats were advertised as custom fitted for my wifes Ford Explorer.The mats are nice quality, not top quality and the custom fit is a little off on the driver side, where they slightly bunch up on the sides. However, for the money, they are nice mats and the ill fit is off just a little. I would recommend them if you are looking for a nice medium priced mat. Just note, they are not factory quality."
4,Loved 80% of this book!,"I rate this book 4 stars, or 4 out of five, for the four out of five parts of the book that I liked. The first 4/5's of the book are wonderful. McCourt writes so honestly and with so much humor that you can't help liking his family even if the family dynamics are hopelessly flawed. I learned a wealth of information about the Irish as well and, though my own ancestors came from Ireland in the 1870's, I felt as if I was learning about their lives, though McCourt's memoir covers a much later period. As far as the 1/5th of the book that I didn't care for, I'm referring to the last part of the book which could be aptly titled: ""Masturbation is My Life."" I found the authors repeated descriptions of his youthful obsession with masturbating (how, where, when) to be tiresome."
2,Dreary Story,"This was a good book for making a person appreciate his/her life and to get an interesting perspective into Ireland's past. The author has a candid, amusing at times storytelling style. However, if you like books with a plot and story line that moves, this isn't for you. It's so depressing too, but things get better at the end."
3,Not my favorite...,"As a fan of so many of Tyler's books, I've been disappointed lately that her protagonists have very few likeable traits. A compelling story has good backstory (this book does) and characters that have traits that we like, or are interesting, or we sympathize with or recognize as fixable. The characters in this book, (with the exception of Jiggs, who ironically, gets only casual mention) are not very interesting. They are sad and unwilling characters in a story that really as no point. Of course, perhaps the point really IS, there are a lot of people in the world who just exist and drift through life, just as I drifted through the book and wondered, ""why?"" Again, Tyler is a phenomenal writer, and I guess I am just missing something. Try the book, and see what you think!"
4,"I'd run away from home, but I can't cross the street...,.","Anne Tyler's characters are quirky - that's a given. And this is an especially quirky and interesting lot. Although an early book, this is a vintage Tyler plot - the woman who needs to run away from home.Thirty-five-year-old Charlotte is in the process of leaving her family - again - when she is taken hostage by the world's most ineffectual bank robber. The two flee by bus to liberate the robber's girl friend from a home for unwed mothers, and in the process we learn Charlotte's story.It's an early Tyler and the characters are a bit over-the-top, but nevertheless worth reading."
4,Breezy and perceptive but not one of her best,"Reading ""Digging to America"" and then ""Earthly possessions"" back to back has confirmed my suspicion that Tyler's earlier novels (of which the latter is one) lacks something that the latter novels have. Is it wisdom? That I do not know. The earlier novels such as this one have the same penetrating perception describing families peopled with the usual eccentric characthers but they are not quite as satisfying and this one is not as moving as some of the later Tyler novels. However, the book is enjoyable and one is left wondering about the complexity of the heroine who we gradually get to know as the novel proceeds by looking deep into her past. But do we really know her? I suspose that is the issue with a lot of Tyler novels, the characthers remain somewhat cryptic and unknowable but maybe that more accurately reflects the reality of life."
3,Not Tyler's best,"I got this because I've really enjoyed Anne Tyler's books, but this one was quite disappointing. It wasn't bad compared to many other books, but it is very weak compared to her other stuff. If you haven't read her before, I would recommend The Accidental Tourist or Digging to America. Those are MUCH better than this one."
4,Typical,"Typical Anne Tyler. Protagonist Charlotte Emory is ready to leave her preacher husband (she's not religious or really in love). Then as fate would have it, gets kidnapped as a hostage in a bank robbery. They travel from Maryland to Florida. Pick up the bank robber's under-age pregnant girlfriend along the way. Lots of stuff happens, lots of stuff gets analyzed to infinity. Interesting drama unfolds towards the end. And at the end, you can't understand why you feel so much for the characters, but you do. Typical Anne Tyler."
4,"Good book, awful movie","There's not much I can write that someone else hasn't already said. As well as being ""quirky"" the female protagonists are usually imperfect physically--middle aged, ""hair that sticks out like birds wings"", etc. I can identify with that. Enough of these beautiful perfect women.But the main point I wanted to make is about the movie ""based"" on this story. The basic premise of the story, that of Charlotte's road trip with a young bank robber is the only thing that stays intact. The 2 main characters relationship with each other is very different and some of the things they do are things Charlotte would never do. It really spoils the whole idea of the story. If I've made you curious I apologise! The only way I reccomend watching it is the way I did, doing something else while watching it. Otherwise, it is a waste of your time."
3,The quirky Tyler characters are somehow appealing.,"I read 1-2 Anne Tyler books a year. The same themes repeat - feeling disconnected or dissatisfied with life but eventually learning to love what you make of what life has given you. I loved the descriptions of the various ""tenants"" coming in and out of the home. I can always picture Ms.Tyler's people and places."
1,Horribly Bland and Depressing,"I read this book in my high school AP english class for independent study and could not believe that it had such a high rating on this website. This was one of the worst books I have ever read. The charcters were not realistic at all. They were all complacent, pathetic, and sad. Who could possibly sympathize with Charlotte?? She is a worthless person who abandons the commitments she has made to her family and her children and doesn't really care. She is so apathetic and egotistical that other people don't seem to matter to her. Albeit, her life certainly isn't perfect but she seriously needs to be on Prozac! And the other charcters, a criminal and a naive pregnant fourteen-year old who wears a pink sundress. Just pathetic! I can't even talk anymore about how atrocious this work was because it is making me angry to just have to write this in the first place. Please, find a book with imagination and character. Go somewhere else!"
1,disappointing intellectually,"I recall this author's book when she worked with Erik Fromm and bought the current book from my interest.THis is an odd, and thin book intellectually.Chose not to finish it."
4,deadsy new cd phanatasmage very good,"this cd is much better than than their last one or 2nd cd that album had one some good and bad songs tomsawyer was on that album this cd is better i give this cd particluar star rating 4 1/2 because they growth on this cd than the last one let put this way 8 songs are good three are bad. i sample it i must buy in march or next month the madonna cd i bought last year wasn,t as good as this cd shakria new cd was ok ciara seem to be to the same page hip hop star thesse guys most artists repeat fromuals on cd,s their 2nd cd 6 of 10 this is better their verison of rush,s tom sawyer IT BETTER THAN RAGE VERISON AND MSI VERISON OF THE SAME SONG IS IT BETTER THAN RUSH VERISON NO GIVE THEM 6/10 ."
3,Only for the fans...,"Lets be honest here, most of the slams i've seen against CC are from people that think Slayer is death metal. Fact is, CC is far from being the best death metal band. Nile and Cryptopsy are both harder, tighter, and generally more intense. However they have improved as time has passed and while the speed at which they improve is remarkably slow, its improvement regardless. Just a note though, when reading any review for a CC album, as soon as the reviewer starts comparing them to a band obviously very far away from death metal then simply ignore that review."
3,good album!,"3.5 is more into like it. to me vile and the bleeding will always be the best cannibal corpse has to offer , although this album is very good to , it has some very bad songs .but song 1,2,3,4,5,6,9,14 are all great"
1,this music should be against the law,this is by far the worst garbage on earth...monkeys with bad gas sounds better then this cd....i can't understand 1 thing he says......bad..music..lyrics..all around bad..and god get rid of the hair ball in your mouth man...check out metallica...they rock
1,BAD...,"Even trying hard and disguise their lack of skill as musicians writing sick songs with sick lyrics, this CD can't escape the fact that it is pure garbage."
1,This is for anyone considering buying this.....,"If you scraped nails over a chalkboard for 3 minutes then looped it around for 15 tracks, then you'd get something better then cannibal corpse. I don't understand why anyone would listen to this.....i've heard 5 seconds of about 3 tracks off of one of their cd's, probably off their cd GOD HATES CHILDREN BECUASE METAL RULES FACES or somethin stupid like that, and i lost a brincell for every second i had to listen to that GARBAGE. Here's every cannibal corpse song GROWL GROWL GUITAR GROWL GUITAR GROWL+GUITAR and so on . If you're even considering buying this garbage, give the money to me and know it wasn't wasted on annoying nosies that a dying animal makes. I'M RIGHT AGAIN.....this is a public service announcement"
1,A absolute discrace to hard music,"Heavy metal or hard rock what ever you would like to call it has seen many diferant faces. From blues rock muscisians like led zeplen and black sabbath that played around with a little distortion to the kings of rap/metal korn. While slayer is cool death metal is probabally the lowest of all metal. Every Canibal corpse cd has sick!!!! and disgusting art work and every song is about killing some one. A absolute discrace to hard music,"
1,Repulsive.,"I guess if you like grating guitars and incoherent vocals juxtaposed to lyrical dreck; and, your the Missing Link, this album is for you. That is; unless you've already gone into a comatose from all that gasoline you've been sniffing. Totally gormless."
1,GALLERY OF BAD SONGS,"This is horrible. Anyone who doesn't agree with that should lsiten the Cd with more caution, to see the flaws in it. There is better death metal than that, folks. Wake up !"
1,Forget about....,"Forget about this CD. It's another bunch of sick lyrics that pretends to shock the public, create controversy and, of course, be loyal to that old motto: "" talk bad, but talk about me!"" Slayer and Napalm Death are only two examples of much better death metal, a genre which is fading into oblivion, because nobody can hear this kind of stuff for many years."
3,You can understand what he is saying if you try.,Well people are always making fun of ths group. If ou don't like them then don't buy their stuff or listen to them.
3,Not bad,"Not bad for C-Corpse. I really thought that the title track was really cool - even though the main riff is a rip off of Celtic Frost's ""Dawn of Meggido"". But hey - if your gonna rip off a riff from somebody, why not Tom Warrior. The rest of the album is pretty straight forward C-Corpse - nothing to shout about."
2,"Psh, I've heard MUCH better",It's true. Probably one of my least favs from Cannibal Corpse. I love their music sooooo much but this album is just way too repetitive and dull. I can't believe I actually fell asleep to a Cannibal Corpse album. But I did!New fans of Cannibal Corpse I reccommend something a little newer such as Kill or Gore Obssessed.
3,They've Done Better,"I was a little dissappointed with Gallery. The songs are well written, but feel more repetitive and tired. The riffs are still awesome and the lyrics are still great, but it's not as refined as Vile or Bloodthirst. If you're a CC fan, you'll still eat this one up though."
5,This album is Brutal,"Cannibal Corpse is an amazing band, but you all know that already. Anyway, got the album today, Gallery of Suicide, I was completly blown away. Until today I thought Chris Barnes had a cooler voice than CorpseGrinder...How wrong I was, CorpseGrinder seems to crush your spine into the concrete every time he growls. Stand out tracks on this album are ""I Will Kill You"", its the first song, and sets the tone for the brutality that is to come. ""Sentenced to Burn"" is like a screwdriver ripping your eyes out, it pounds you into your chair. ""Gallery of Suicide"" starts out slow, then explodes into hyper speed, I think its my fav song on the album. The instrumental ""From Skin to Liquid"" is so damn heavy...its such an Evil rythem, its amazing...All I can say is, go for the neck, buy this album as soon as you can."
5,Excellent CD for death metal fans,Dont complain if you cant understand the lyrics. Its only for people who really like this music. Butchered at Birth is also excellent.
5,"Head pounding, neck breaking!",One of my 1st Death Meatl CD's I've bought. Sentenced to Burn is the best of the CD. It's rythmic beat and grueling vocals takes you on a head slaming ride!
4,BEST YET!!!!!,"This CC CD is the best yet!! even though their past CD's such as vile were very good, this one is still better. My personal favorite songs on it are ""I will kill you"" and ""dismembered and molested."" BUT, no one will ever replace ""shredded humans"""
2,"CC has sold out, but is anyone really buying ???","Gawd WHAT AN AWFUL ALBUM. Just About everything in this CD (excluding the bass work) is greatly lacking; George ""corpsegrinder"" Fisher's vocals sound like a hormone induced bad Max Cavalera impression, Jack Owen and new guitarist Pat O'brien (who I must admit is better than Barrett) fall way below par to their previous efforts and Paul Mazurciewicz must've been smoking WAY too much hash during the recording stage because his once fast paced drumming in this album is slower than senior citizens day at the drag strip. In my opinion CC should immediately call Chris Barnes and beg him to come back because they are a headless chicken without him. The only thing that gave this album 2 stars was the fact that the sound quality is on the up and up"
2,"Better than before, but still depraved and earsplitting.","Corpse COULD write a decent metal album, but they figure (and they're right) that disgusting lyrics, inhumanly fast drums, and guitar abuse will sell better. When the drumming slows down on Sentenced To Burn, it is pretty trippy. It's a shame that the whole album isn't like this."
1,Whats wrong with you people,"If you think this is good music you live a very sheltered life. If you think corpse is the fastest, you havent listened to the new cryptopsy, and as for heaviness, well i like it to have some structure too. The drumming is BORING. Suffocation is way heavier, faster and more technical. Corpse just makes me fall asleep."
1,Ridiculous,"Come on guys get real. the lyrics are absolutely a joke, and the music is so simple its not even funny. Nile can kick C.C.'S *** any day, along with dismember, suffocation, slayer, pantera and obituary. I admit the music is heavy but it needs a lot more than that to be good."
5,Cannibal Corpse shreds on,"Picking up where Vile left off, Cannibal Corpse have done it again. Always on the forefront of the death metal scene, this album is one of the best releases this year in this genre. Pat O'brien proves to be very good replacement for Rob Barrett. The drums are typical Mazurciewicz, not extremely complex, put precise as a mother@#%!!. Songs like Sentenced to Burn and Gallery of Suicide show a ever evolving Cannibal Corpse, while songs like I Will Kill You and Blood Drenched Execution, show that they can still use an old style and keep it fresh. I have always felt Corpsegrinder was more than an adequate replacement for Barnes, even more brutal. A definate must have for those into BRUTAL music."
4,CC are the new Jars of Clay,"I generally dont listen to much Christian Rock, but Cannibal Corpse may very well change that. I found it quite obvious that these precocious lads are disguising Christian theology with metal-phors! For example, when Corpsegrinder sings about eating babies, he's essentially trying to communicate the wonder of the Eucharist. Unfortunately, all the preaching wears a little thin by mid-album. I would recommend the new Clay Aiken over this album simply because its a little darker and edgier than CC. But all in all this is a good album and should hold all of us CC fans over until the new Creed CD comes out."
4,Great album...,"One of the best of CC. Oh and as for the person who gave it a bad review go look at some of his other reviews and you will see why he is such a moron. Unless 50 cent is featuring Corpse Grinder on his next album, I dont know how this tool even came across CC. Obviously anyone who listens to talentless music like rap knows nothing about good musiciansmanship."
3,I have a new view on this!,After some time I enjoyed listening to Cannibal Corpse and blocking out the lyrics. To me the music is intense and just hits hard but I cannot keep absorbing the imagery this music gives me. Anyone who listens to Cannibal Corpse I hope is young and dumb. We all grow up eventually. Afterall some of us for the most part will get married and have children some day.
1,horrible songs,"If you have bad taste, buy this now. If you like real metal, skip this one. Nothing here."
3,Juliet looks for a murderer in the past,"This entry in the mommy-track mystery series follows Juliet as she tries to be a good mommy, wife, and detective--with morning sickness interruptions.Juliet detects in various interesting places, including a drug treatment clinic for the very rich, a strange Raellian-like cult, Hollywood, a Mexican commune in the 60's, and among the Pasadena politicos.An interesting mystery with lots of interesting twists."
4,Follow this Mommy,"I still enjoy the Mommy Track Mysteries. They are fun, simple and entertaining. Ms Waldman's style is funny and sarcastic. It's a great summer/beach read. Enjoy!"
3,Why only half of the picture?,"This is a compilation that contains half songs from The Dirt Band's first album and half from their second. Both of these albums are very short and would have easily fit on one disc. Everytime I listen to it, it just annoys me that I can't hear the other half of the first album. Some of the most interesting songs, such as ""Euphoria"", ""Melissa"" and ""Crazy Words, Crazy Tune"" were left off. I wish I could find the first album in it's entirety on compact disc."
3,It would have been better to reissue the debut,"The first two albums by the Dirt Band were split in half for one disc released in the UK in 1967. Only having half of each album leaves a good second half out of the picture. BGO has reissued ""Ricochet"" in it's entirety, so why have this album out with half of that on it? Why not just reissue the first album? The first album is essential in any west-coast, jugband,country (etc.) collection. If you can find the LP of it (Liberty LST-7501) pick it up. This is a good compilation for the Bruce Kunkel-era Dirt Band (just these two albums,only). You should then seek out BGO's 2 on 1 of the Dirt Band's 3rd and 4th albums ""Alive"" and ""Rare Junk""."
3,Where is the 1st LP?,"The previous 3 reviews are absolutely correct... the 1st Nitty Gritty Dirt Band LP needs to be reissued on CD. I even wrote the groups management and asked why the 1st LP has not been reissued. The answer I received as somewhat disconcerting, ""we have no knowledge of anyone reissuing the groups 1st LP on CD anytime in the near or distant future"". I am wondering if it isn't tied up with legal issues. I just can't imagine that the group would not want their 1st LP, which is a total classic, reissued for their fans. Makes no sense. But then again look how long it took to get Fever Tree's 1st LP reissued. I guess we can only hope!"
3,Disappointed in This Collection,"I am a huge fan of the Mill Creek Entertainment 50 movie packs and own quite a few, but this collection, ""Legends of Horror"" is a disappointment. As other reviews have stated, this collection features many of the films that are on the other 50 Movie Packs. So there is very little ""new"" movies on this set. Do not be fooled by the cover art shown here on amazon either, the cover does not feature Christopher Lee, Bela Lugosi, or Boris Karloff on the front instead it is a cheesy layout of skulls. I would recommendHorror Classics 50 Movie Pack Collectioninstead of this collection because the films are much better than on this set."
2,Damaged case,The price was great just I received it with the bottom of the case broken...not sure how I'm going to store the cds now :(
2,Horror,Looks good for the horror fan. This was a gift for a friend who is a great fan of the old B&W stuff
2,The cover is the best part of this collection,"The cover art on this collection is very misleading. It implies that we will be receiving quality horror films of the featured actors. These movies aren't even the ""B"" movies that were shown at the drive-ins. The sound quality is not that great, muddy most of the time. The acting in some of these movies seems forced, almost to the point of over-acting. These movies are more of drama than horror. If you are looking for a collection with Frankenstein, Dracula, the Mummy, this collection is not for you. If you like movies of the quality of The Brain that Wouldn't Die, The Killer Shrews, The Hand, the movies on this collection are so much less that that.I'm truly disappointed in this collection. Don't let the great cover art fool you like it did me."
4,Air Texture Spray,"It worked well. Trigger got stuck sometimes.... Overall, it did the job at a cheap price. If you're a DIYer, you need to make sure you have a compressor, compressor lines and fittings and pressure regulator. This doesn't come with instructions. All it comes with is the gun, hopper, and some fittings for the spray pattern. They have a diagram for you to order parts as well."
2,not what I thought,did not come with good instructions ...... would not buy another one ..should have gone to Home Depot..next time..I won't go cheap
5,Execellent and Quick Service,And I don't need to say a great price.. or sale... Good for me! Great for the company because their on my favorite list.
1,Worthless!,One star was given because that was the minimum. The spec's do not mention the compressor that will be need to run this gun. Unless you do commercial or industrial work you will likely not have a compressor that will work with this gun. You are better off to get the Wagner gun that will do great texture work.
1,Too expensive,"Charging this price for a DRM'ed Kindle book is nothing short of highway robbery. Sorry, but given the limitations on the format, $9.99 is the max you should be charging."
1,Lower the price and you'll make some sales,I need a book on Slovenia for my tour guiding reference collection (now on Kindle) but there's no way I can pay this much...
4,Bible of Flight Mechanics,"yes it is like the bible, because it gives every information in such a way that you find your own way to learn.... it would be better and easy to read if the pages were bigger. that's it...."
4,Flight Dynamics,"i taught a course for several years at the University of Maryland using this book. It is the best book on aircraft static and dynamic stability. Other books on this subject skip over static stbility and go on to dynamic stability and feed back controls. Etkin does cover dynamic stability pretty well, but when he gets into any type of feedback control such as yaw mode supression, this book shows it age. Even in dynamic statility work, the non-dimensionalizing of the equations (non-dimentional time particularly) is adds nothing. If this section were up to date, then it would be a bit more useful. Nevertheless, the static stability coveage is excellent: there are no other books on the market which do this area as well. It would be more useful if feedback controls were left to a second volume and maybe helipter static stability covered as well."
5,"it's awesome and you know this, MAN","the samsung 42"" is great! standard cable is nice, HD picture is even better. there's no need to worry about images burning in, the pixel shift function works great and have never noticed any ghost images so dont let others scare the shnikes out of you. solid tv for anyone looking to upgrade."
2,Great TV before it died,Had the set 6 weeks when it stopped turning on. Now going through the run around of getting service out. 5 days since I called Samsung and still no appointment yet.
5,another winner,"I have the 50"" incher of the same model down stairs and I was impressed so for upstairs get the 42"", both are just superb. Pictures can not be equalled. More than satisfied. For the price can't be beat."
1,Useless after just a few years. *Class Action Lawsuit Filed*,"We loved this tv until last week when it started making a clicking noise and cycling on and off. Turns out that Samsung settled a class action laws suit regarding this same issue in many of their televisions. They cut corners when manufacturing and installed capacitors that weren't of high enough voltage to last more than a couple of years. Of course, my model isn't included in the settlement. I'm on hold with them right now, but I have a feeling our options are to repair it on our own dime (which could be a few hundred dollars) or replace it completely. I will NEVER buy another Samsung product again. I would not recommend this product or company to anyone. I'd love to get in on another class action lawsuit with other unhappy customers."
2,Almost made it to 5 years!,"Purchased in August 2007... Dead due to faulty power supply April 2012.I called customer service today and inquired about repair, mentioning that I'd read the Class Action lawsuit they settled regarding the same issue in their LCD televisions. I was told they could send out a repair technician, but I would be paying for the call and any repair since my unit is out of warranty and NOT part of the Class Action lawsuit. Mine is this plasma model. (HPT4254) I find it very sad that the company knows about this defective part (used in many of their products) and refuses to support all of their customers. I will not buy Samsung again. I do not recommend anyone spend money on a unit that will likely only last 5 years. I am very disappointed and dissatisfied. Save yourself a headache and keep looking!I gave the two stars based on the performance of the unit until it died, picture quality, features and available input options. Definitely not the best out there."
1,Went off exactly after one year,"I bought this TV last August from Best Buy and two days before it went off. I hear a click sound when I turn on, but nothing comes up. I even use a surge protector power supply.I used to have TVs lasting more than 20 years, but I am surprised to see this Big Brand TV going off in just one year. Unfortunately, I didnt buy the extended warranty. The charges towards fixing this issue seems to be around 40% of TV cost. I called up Samsung also if they can help with my problem. They told the same story what Best Buy told me, that fix up an appointment with technical engineer and I need to bear the whole cost, as I am out of Warranty. But they keep their mouth shout, when I ask why did this fault happen.So Beware of this problem, before buying this TV. I am totally disappointed with purchasing this TV."
4,TV delivery,"They delivered it when expected and helped unload the 42"" TV and waited until the product was inspected and everything looked good. The picture is great and my dad is very happy with it."
5,Samsung 42-inch plasma TV,"Great TV! Arrived quickly. Looks great, wonderful picture (720p is eye-popping), adequate sound from the built-in speakers, swivels generously on the included stand. Like other plasma TVs, it does generate a fair amount of heat, but in the cold Northeast this time of year, that's a bonus."
5,Love it,"After reviewing many TVs, I decided to go with this one. I've had it for 4 months now and love it.One bit of advice for those about to break into the HD world. When we first plugged in the TV, I thought I did something wrong because the picture didn't take up the entire screen area. What I found out later is that non-HD channels only display in a portion of the screen. I wish there were more HD channels to display on this great TV."
4,"Where was the ""White Glove Treatment""?","Great product - excellent picture quality. Great price (on sale for less than 1200.00). I was extremely disappointed in Amazon however. They said that it would be delivered with the ""White Glove Treatment"" and it would be set up. The delivery company said other customers said the same thing but they were there just to drop it off. No set up involved."
3,First Plasma Experience,"This is my first plasma tv, third HDTV. I have a Phillips crt and a Sharp Aquos LCD as well. I am not sure if my expectations were too high, but the picture quality, while good, is not what I expected. There's also inconcsistency in picture quality, even between different HD channels. Also, when the TV is turned on for the first time in a given day, the right half of the screen does not show any picture, initially. After about five minutes it corrects itself but it's kind of annoying. A call to Samsung said I should try reseting the TV, not sure how to do that and was then put on hold and got disconnected. Have not had a chance to call back. I am using HDMI, but didn't go monster based on the research I did that suggested cable quality is not as critical at lengths under 10"" for HDMI. I may try that. I am using Belkin HDMI that I also purchased on Amazon. Can't beat the price, but so far my experience has been lukewarm at best."
3,Zoom Feature,"Actually Panasonic does offer a ZOOM feature for their 42"" plasma (the latest model) This will zoom and crop out the black bars from any aspect ratio without distorting the shape."
4,Great picture,"Unbelievable picture quality which has made viewing movies and sporting events all the better. Only issue to date has been some ""block/freezing"" issues....however, not sure if it is the TV or the signal feed. If it continues will have a samsung person take a look."
1,Poor,"Out of the box this TV looks great - problem is a flaw in the firmware that makes the the sound drop out every 30 mins or so and you have to turn the set off and on.If you already have one of these sets, Samsung has a fix for this. HOWEVER, if you implement the fix going by the guidelines on the Samsung web site it will KILL YOUR TV - the instructions are incomplete and Samsung ""customer service"" will suggest that you go pay some service organization to fix the problem. Great picture - extreemly bad attitude towards fixing problems that they acknowledge exist and were their fault.BEWARE OF SAMSUNG Customer Service.Very bad experience!"
1,Breakdown with clicking noise HPT4264 Plasma TV,"Everyone is reporting the same issue. Clicking noise where the TV is trying to power on but it can't. As everyone else has said, Samsung settled a class-action lawsuit for the 50 inch TV's but has not provided any relief to those of us who bought the 42 inch model.Unfortunately its true. If you buy this TV, you will also suffer a breakdown sooner or later. Save your money!"
2,echo the clicking problem,I have just been hit with the known problem of this module powering off and then just clicking. I am not sure why this model was not included in the class action suit for this problem when it is obvious that this module has the same problem.
3,"Not a great layzie album, but not too bad either","First off. Layzie is a great rapper and has some great verses on many bone songs. But he just cannot make it solo. This is a decent album and has a few standout tracks, but is only recommended for the die hard bone thugs fans like myself who want to own every btnh song ever made. The standouts are:""Vote for Me"" (A great upbeat song, that is similar to 1st of tha month)""Mo Murder"" (Great beat with Layzie's unique rapping inbetween)""For My Weed heads"" (C'mon the title alone explains it, great song)""Streets (Ft. Bizzy) (Great beat with bizzy spittin as he always does)""Touchdown W/ Mo Thugs"" (Very interesting song with a cool style, listen to this).The highlights are few and far between but this should be bought by the true bone fans"
3,Bone is the best group!,"But Layzie goes from wack to tight song to song and his solos are not that great but, this is his best solo with about 5 good songs on this album, Bone's solo with interscope records comes out in December and will be a super hit, [...]"
1,what is happening to bone?,"bone should go back to their old style, when dj u-neek was producing them. now they are all wack, except from the newest krazy bones album gemini... dont buy this, dont even bother if ur a bone fan"
1,Cheap,"I was very disappointed with this product. When I opened the box, one of the bear button hooks came off! They were brand new. Now, I am afraid every bear will fall off and not hold the shower curtain. The hooks are plastic. They were expensive and not worth the money due to how cheaply they are made."
2,"cute, but not sturdy","These items were going to the perfect accent to my woodsy decor bathroom. Unfortunately, when they arrived, one was broken. When I looked closely at the others, I found them to be rather flimsy. They would never hold the cotton shower curtain I had. I returned them and was promptly refunded."
3,Mars Volta - 'Widow' (Universal),"Two track CD single that is to store right behind your copy of their 'Francis The Mute' effort (see my review). First, there's the title cut that is actually a non-lp song ""Francis The Mute"" (14:39) with some rather intriguing lyrics - sort of maybe reminds me of Zeppelin's 'Houses Of The Holy' era and the radio edit of ""The Widow"" (3:19). Overall, not a bad rarity - but why is this CD single so costly?"
4,good scales,"A stylish and functional addition to the weight management oriented kitchen. Still have to learn a few of the extras, but these are good scales."
5,Great for this price!,"While the other reviews I read praised this scale but were occasionally put-off with the 'grams' default.....I must tell you that this must since have been addressed at the company. My Escali shows ounces first, to the tenths, and stays on that reading a good long while before showing grams. A back-light would've been handy, but not likely for this reasonable price. Good deal, good product."
5,Love it!,"Small, reliable, durable (that was tested by accidentally dropping it a few times). I also love that it uses simple AA batteries."
5,good stuff.,"Look, I've been using plastic ""cheapies"" for years. They were nice, but not exact and hard to read to get even close. This does the trick. I like it a lot. If you want reasonable price and quality, buy it. If you want to spend money just to spend, go ahead. This is worth it."
5,Simple & it works,"It's a simple design, it does its job well, the end. I originally bought this for more accurate baking (cake ingredients are often measured in weight), but have found it handy for shipping as well. Now when I sell things online, I can take advantage of discounted shipping prices by printing my own labels. Saves time too because I can drop things off rather than wait in line at the post office or UPS."
5,nicest little scale,"This scale is very accurate and compact. You can put a heavy plate on it, hit the Tare function and measure the food only on the plate. IT is very accurate! It's flat compact design is also neat. I can't think of a single complaint: we'll have to see how long this hard plastic scale lasts!Update 9/13/09: Still going strong though the battery compartment door now needs a piece of duct tape to keep it closed (on back)."
2,Not accurate for smaller items,"If you are looking for a scale with pinpoint accuracy, this is not the scale for you. When doing the nickel test ( each should be 5 grams) the scale seems to weight the nickels anywhere from 4-6 gr. I tried several experiments with 5 nickels. Where they are placed the on the scale will make a difference in the numbers. Stacking or laying them flat also makes a difference. Even when not touching the nickels, sometimes the numbers would just jump around with a 10-15% variance. I then tried weighing items that had a bit more heft. It seemed to handle items that were 4oz or above with a bit more consitency and accuracy."
5,"Great product, Great Price, Got here early","I researched scales for a while before making my choice. This model was highly recommended from several friends as well - it will not disappoint. Loooove that it zeros out the bowls and plates and found it very accurate. Its cute, cleans easy, easy to move, and easy to use. I cant ask for anything else. Even with free shipping - it actually got here a day early! So that was a nicer surprise! Love this product - Used daily."
4,Good deal for the price.,"This product works fine, great deal for the price, I am able to weigh out what I need accurately."
5,Seems perfect to me,"After reading some of the reviews here, I decided there was not a good, cheap alternative so I bought one anyway. I have not had any problems whatsoever with the unit.It works perfectly every time."
5,Exceptionally Useful,"I have had other digital scales and was very dissatisfied with their performance. However, with this item - it has proven to be exceptionally durable and very useful/reliable. While its price is somewhat higher than competitor models, it is well worth the added cost!"
3,OK - But,On first use one of the bottom pads fell off and got lost. It seems to have been a product deficiency
4,Very good scale,"My Soehnle kitchen scale had just died on me (beautiful but not too reliable) and I needed a new scale. I decide on the Escali P115C because of the size and mostly the good reviews it had received. So far it is an excellent scale. Seem very accurate, the tare function works flawlessly allowing me to add ingredients by its weight. Being able to read Grams, Ounces and Lbs/Ounces is a good plus (the Soehnle did only grams & Lbs/Oz). Another plus is the fact that uses AA batteries, the Soehnle used button batteries that were somewhat difficult to source.The only ""complaint"" I have (if you can call it that) is that is is mostly built of plastic. Wish it was all metal but hey, at that price guess you can't have it all!"
4,Great scale for multiple uses,"I did a lot of research before buying a food scale. My need was for accurate weight when making my artisan breads. It works great. I like the extra functions that other scales do not provide, such as weight conversion, scale reset for adding more ingredients, etc.My biggest complaint is the difficulty in viewing the display when you use larger bowls.I know this scale is often used for others who weigh their food for nutritional purposes. I do not use my scale for that reason, so cannot speak to the specifics of that function.Overall, very nice scale for the functions and the money."
4,Nice little scale,Seems to work as expected. No issues yet. Seems accurate as far as I can tell. Compact. Seems rugged enough.
5,Love it!,I bought this scale to use measuring foods for my Weight Watchers. Love it! Just the right size for everything I'm weighing and also stores nicely on the counter..especially because of the pretty orange color. Easy to use multi functions - perfect for my WW diet!
5,Great Value,Weighing ingredients insures consistency in bread making. This scale has been a great help to a novice baker!
4,I'm very happy with this product,"This scale is easy to use and doesn't take up a lot of space. The only drawback is if you measure onto a plate or bowl, it covers the display (the reason I didn't give it 5 stars.) Given the price, I can live with that."
5,Excellent buy!,"I am very, very pleased with this scale. I've had it for several weeks now, and used it to measure just about everything I could. It does everything it said it would, and so far I have experienced absolutely no problems. It is also very easy to clean, lightweight and looks good on my countertop. I would absolutely recommend this scale to anyone who's looking for a inexpensive kitchen scale."
5,Great Way to Weigh!,"This is a great way to weigh! It is accurate and easy to turn on and off. It does not take up counter space and could easily fit into a kitchen drawer. I leave mine out because it is small and so handy. Love this scale and the way it shows weights. Would highly recommend this one! It really helps with portion controls and ""eyeballing"" food is never a good idea, nor is it accurate! Try this little kitchen jewel!"
4,I love this food scale!,This scale does a good job and it also looks great in my kitchen. It doesn't take much space on your kitchen counter. I like how it comes in 7 different colors!
5,Easy to use - I actually enjoy baking now!,"I always used to hate baking... Measuring flour & brown sugar (esp. when it was old & got all hard & clumpy) were torture for me. I was always irritated by the whole ""scoop-and-level"" thing. And sometimes I'd think I had it right & would still screw up the recipe. This scale makes all of that a breeze now (so long as the recipe has the conversion for different types of flour) - it's idiot-proof. Plus the scale is very small, lightweight, and thoroughly unobtrusive. A+++ for Escali for design, ease of use, and reasonable price..."
5,Wonderfully Simple,"I am delighted with this purchase from Amazon.com. The scale is well-built and is easy to use. This is a must-have for anyone concerned about nutrition. After starting to use this scale, it was much easier to estimate my caloric intake (which, I learned, I was grossly underestimating)."
4,"works great, just very small","This scale works really well and seems accurate, but the problem I have with it is that is so tiny. You can only weigh small amounts because you cannot fit much on this scale. What I end up doing when I have to weigh large amounts is fitting as much as I can on the scale, then writing down how many oz, and continue doing so until all of it is gone. This gets to be a little bit annoying. A feature that they could have made to make this easier would be if there was an ""add"" button, so that you wouldn't have to write down anything, and the scale would total it. So if you are not weighing a lot of food, this scale is nice. I plan to get another larger one though, as I am always weighing large amounts of food."
5,Love this scale!,"I purchased this scale and I'm very glad I did. It's compact,lightweight and very easy to use. Some cookbooks list their ingredients by weight instead of cups and this helps out greatly with the automatic tare feature. An indespensable tool for a baker to have! I recommend 100%!! :)"
1,Worst scale I have ever used,"I go to a very prestigious culinary school where a digital scale is a must in the bakery. After having the scale for less than a month, it read OUT2 on it. I tried to change the batteries but nothing changed. I called the manufacture of this scale and they said it was mistreated, held too much weight, or got in contact with water. Hello, it's a kitchen scale. I am a professional, and when they said I misused it, I was very insulted. Not only was this a waste of money for a poor college student, it will affect my grade when it comes to not having a scale."
2,Not at all accurate,"I checked the accuracy of my scale after I bought it and it was not even close. The instruction manual is not very helpful. The scale displayed in grams by default. To get it to display in lb and oz you have to hold the button down. I thought it should toggle the function, unless mine was defective. I do not recommend this scale at all."
2,"I'm sure it's functional, but...","I'm sure it's functional, but it looks rather ugly. Needing a kitchen scale, I made a quick and un-researched buying decision based on the strength of the reviews for this product. In particular, one of the first reviews I read was ""the scales are very attractive,"" and so I hit buy without a second thought.Upon receipt though, my take is that it's not terrible but it does look rather like something you'd pick up in Chinatown. Cheap plastic, cheap ""chrome"" paint, a flimsy feel and a proportionally small measuring surface. I've decided to return it for something a little prettier and a little more expensive."
2,Disappointing in the Long Term,"I used this scale several times a week for six months, stored it flat in a cabinet with nothing pressing against it, and always operated it on flat, dry surfaces. I took it out of the cupboard today and it wouldn't work. I replaced the batteries. Nothing. Tried a different set of batteries, still no power. I'm so disappointed. I really loved this little scale and relied on it more than any of my other kitchen gadgets. While it works, it's great, but I had no idea the lifespan on these things was so limited."
3,Not quite up to my expectations,"I make soap, lotions and facial products. When I'm weighing items, I need precision. I had read very good reviews for this product. After owning this product for about 6 months, maybe using 30 times and 2 battery changes (just in case the batteries were bad), I can't get the scale to weigh reliably in .01oz increments. When I'm weighing items that are very light, I'll often get a jump in .04oz increments or no change at all. If you just needed this for everyday weighing, it would probably be sufficient, but for more precise measurements, I would use caution."
5,"Excellent, accurate and easy to use!","This scale from Escali is wonderful! I am a newly-diagnosed diabetic and I am also in preparation for weight-loss surgery and have to weigh everything I eat to keep up with my portions. This scale is wonderfully accurate and very easy to use. I especially like the tare feature where you weigh a container first, such as a plate, then add your food item and get an accurate reading for it separately. Comes in very handy!!"
5,Handy In And Out Of The Kitchen!,This is a great little digital scale! The nicest feature when weighing food items is that it will deduct the weight of any container you want to use and gives you just the weight of your food. My husband also used it to weigh my daughter's pinewood derby car and it worked well!
4,wonderful and inexpensive,Love the scale. The best feature is that it will subtract out the weight of your container or wax paper which gives a more accurate weight and helps keep the scale clean!
3,"It's OK, but . . .","I bought this scale to replace and old mechanical scale that I had dropped. As far as I can tell, this scale works; I do like the tare feature and the tenth-of-an-ounce calibration.I wish the weighing area was larger -- a large bowl does not fit on it easily. It also can be very difficult to see the numbers if the scale isn't in a strong light. The gram and ounce notation is very tiny and difficult to see. All in all, I wish I had spent a bit more and gotten a scale that is more user-friendly."
5,light weight scale,"Very light scale. Easy to use.One feature we like about this scale is...once scale is turned on, place a bowl on the scale & press the left button which cancels the weight of the bowl. Then place your food in the bowl and it will weigh just the food. We do that to keep the scale clean plus some things would not rest on the scale well, such as bread dough, browned ground beef, or pinto beans.This scale weighs up to 11 lbs."
4,Very Good Kitchen Scale,"I love this scale! It's compact (stores easily), portable (easily moved), and very easy to work. Great display with large, easy to read, clear numbers. It would deserve 5 stars if the area to hold your bowl/cup/pan was larger, and if the display was offset so that it could be read if your bowl/cup/pan creates an overhang. Otherwise, love it, wouldn't trade it for any other model!"
4,great,"love this scale because i can change it to grams, ounces, or pounds..is a little small though but really good"
2,Liked it until it stopped working,"I've had this scale about 4 years. I don't use it much, about once or twice a week to weigh out 3 - 4 g of tea, once every couple of months to weigh flour for a loaf of bread. It worked fine until today. Today, the display began to show strange things - couldn't get it to tare, couldn't get it to change from g to oz. I put in new batteries, and the problems continue. Even though it's inexpensive, I don't want to have to buy a new scale every 4 years - very wasteful, financially and environmentally. I won't buy another one, and I don't recommend this scale. Shoddy product, considering how little use it saw."
5,Awsome scale for a great price!!,I love this scale. I haven't had any problems with any part of it. The scale is made with a light plastic and I was nervous that it may be cheap but it works great and is easy to use. Can't beat it for the price and it does exactly what you want. It also comes with batteries which is a plus seeing as I wanted to use it as soon as it came to my house and of course I couldn't find my batteries. Just another perk.
2,low quality,"With this much amount of low price, I know I can't expect high quality. But the battery cover never stays where it's supporsed to be and comes off so easily. Sometimes this product doesn't turn on because batteries come off. If you don't want to deal with those low qualities, I recommend to get more expensive product."
5,first rate little scale,"The problem with the battery lid seems to have been resolved. No problem putting battery in and closing lid. While there have been comments that the scales finish was 'cheap' the white scale looks great. The scale is small so it does not take up much shelf space but weighs up to 11 pounds which is more than enough for my needs. It is easy to switch between American, ounces or pounds/ounces to the metric grams. Very useful if you are using an European recipe which measures ingredients by weight not volume. The weight of packages and letters agrees with the Postal service weight so the scale is accurate. I love the multiple tare feature. Zero for the bowl, add an ingredient, zero again, add the next ingredient and so on, all with a single press of a button."
1,not a good scale at all!,"I have seen the reviews for this scale, which is why I purchased it (not at Amazon). But, I had a much different experience. It was not accurate (I compared against an old scale I had), the batteries did not last long, and was just a pain to get it to work well. I finally junked it and bought a Salter at the store."
3,Giving it a second chance,"My first scale pooped out on me after less then a month. The digital screen constantly read OVER. only on rare occasions would it let me weigh anything. I contacted Amazon, and a new one was sent to me within a week (just received yesterday). I am hoping this one will last longer. I loved it until it died! hoping that this was just a fluke and the second one will cure all my woes. Amazon is amazing though. Great customer service!"
2,Good But!,"I purchased this scale about 2.5 years ago. Before the first year was up, the digits were unreadable. I could not find the material to contact the company and it became junk."
2,"Escali Primo Digital Multifunctional Scale, Soft Pink","Product feels like cheap plastic. Battery compartment is flimsy; door keeps popping off. Does the job, just not sure how well it will hold up for every day use."
5,Great little scale,Got the scale to replace a kitchen aid one that worked on springs. It is very light and easy to store. Completely supports one's obsessive personality traits - was that 0.32 or 0.33 oz of almond pieces? With this scale you will know!
1,Door to battery compartment keeps breaking!,"I've tried two scales with the same problem each time--the little tab on the door to the battery compartment breaks off, preventing you from opening the compartment and inserting the batteries. At first I thought it was a disposable plastic part, it broke off so easily. I was sure to let the second one warm up inside a good long time, thinking it might simply have been too cold from a morning in the UPS truck, but the same thing happened again.This might be a fine little scale, but you have to be able to get the batteries in!"
1,broken after ~1 month,"This scale seemed great, and at a great price. I used it modestly for a little more than one month, and now it reads ""out2"" and doesn't work. The Escali website says, ""Out2 is displayed when too much force (i.e. overload) has affected, and potentially damaged the loadcell"". No elephants in my kitchen... the last time I used it was while making a normal sized batch of bread - I was weighing out the loaves prior to proofing. I turned it off, wiped it clean (no excessive use of water) and put it away."
1,Lasted one year,"After about 3 months the flimsy battery door cover broke. After about 1 year the LCD display got stuck on ""out2"" and the unit could not be used or reset. Very cheap plastic construction."
4,Wife loves it!,My wife loves this and uses it quite often. She finds more and more uses for it all the time. Highly reccomend
4,Serviceable Kitchen Scale,"This product is simple to use, has a small (but sturdy) footprint, and is easy to clean when needed. While it measures in single-gram increments, you probably wouldn't want to use it to measure anything weighing down in the single digits (for that, you'd want to get one of their models that weighs in 0.1 g increments), but for typical kitchen measurements, its accuracy and precision far exceeds what anyone could expect to need. Very useful, and I intend to buy any future digital scales I may need from Escali in the future."
5,Great little scale!,"Im using this scale for food portions and it performs that task perfectly. The tare function works well. You can easily switch between ounces, pounds and grams. Great product."
5,Kitchen best buy,"Of my many years in the kitchen I never had a scale accurate enough for measuring ingredients. Didn't think I needed one! Then, I heard about the benefits of using an accurate scale in baking. After seeing the many favorable reviews of this Escali scale I ordered one. After using it just one time I wouldn't ever be without it. So easy to use, and so accurate. In baking I now save time, and have flavor and texture consistency time after time. Thank You Escali, and Thank You Amazon for your usual excellent service and delivery time."
4,Escali Primo Digital Scale is a Good value,"Nothing spectacular, but if you want a good general purpose kitchen/postage scale at a reasonable price, this is the one."
4,it works,"The product works as described, the only annoying thing is that it turns off after 20 seconds, making it a pain for using as a shipping scale. Doesn't have an adapter, only batteries"
2,dies after awhile,"UPDATED 11/25/12: I would no longer recommend this scale to anyone. I bought one for myself and parents and both of ours have died/stopped working. It's not a battery issue it's the actual unit. Disappointed.BOUGHT in 2009: I have been meaning to buy a digital scale for at home for the longest time. I'm in the food industry, and am use to the big nice scales and balance scale. So I have been debating on which one to get, with all the great reviews I figured this one would not disappoint. I enjoy the different color selection too. Works great, it's pretty small, but big enough to set a bowl on and be able to see the #'s, which I know some have issues with. Love the grams, ounces, or # and ounces option. Happy it goes up to 11#'s wish they had one just like it that would go up to 20, but it does the trick for my baking. Overall great product and I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a nice small scale for at home."
5,Just as described,I received this scale very quickly and am quite pleased with it. It appears to be very accurate. Also the color is great (not an eyesore if it has to be left on the counter). Am glad I decided on this one.
4,Works just as it should,"This thing is exactly what I was expecting. It does everything it's supposed to, exactly how it should. I'd give it five stars, but I don't particularly like the plastic casing used in its manufacturing. A small complaint, to be sure."
1,poor experience all around,"When I received this scale the 'tare' function did not work. I returned the item. I was charged $25.00 on my card, received an e-mail from Amazon saying that I would be refunded $19.45. I guess that even though the product was defective, I still had to pay the shipping. I have yet to see the $19.45 credit on my card."
3,Why the package didn't get delivered.,"WTH, Amazon? Why the package didn't get delivered. You didn't call me. You didn't write down what I suggested. You spent your money trying to ship it to me twice. Do you think I'll get a credit? Geez . . . ."
3,Function - acceptable; Form - just okay,"The scale works to the specifications that were stated. Occasionally it doesn't turn on immediately, but so far it is still in working order. It is however the ugliest color. Not sure what I was expecting but it wasn't this. It looks very cheap. However I suppose for the price I can't complain."
3,How accurate is this?,"Placed one-ounce of 99.99% certified coin, machine reads 1.1 oz. Placed ten one-ounce coins, machine reads 11.0 oz.There is no way to adjust/calibrate this one to use it with confidence. I wouldn't use it anywhere else, except maybe to measure the weight of berries, thought I have no idea why anyone would do such trivial stuff."
3,Not a good value,"A lightweight - it works but feels cheap. Not worth the price. I later bought a better quality, better features scale for the same money."
2,"No ""Tare"" function/Buy the Chrome One","Bought the chrome product which seems more sturdy than the color versions. The tare function failed after only a short time. Received a replacement right away from Amazon and surprisingly, tare function doesn't work on anything over 2 lbs. Sad. Recommend not buying a scale from this manufacturer. I'll keep mine since it seems to be accurate enough for ordinary kitchen work even if I can't use the tare function."
5,Perfect all around scale.,"I actually bought this as a postage/kitchen scale because I hate unitaskers. It works perfect on both levels. Weighs down to 1/2 ounce and up to 11 pounds. If I have anything in the kitchen that weighs more than 11 lbs. I just split it up and add it together. If I mail something more than 11 lbs it's more likely to be taken to the PO or UPS anyway, so it doesn't matter. This scale is small, efficient, attractive, and stores easily. Thanks!"
2,not as expected,"purchased the item after reading the reviews, but received a defective product that doesn't read. Maybe I'm just unlucky. Also the room for battery is too much, so the battery keeps coming off its place. Returned it and bought a different brand from Amazon. Good comments on Amazon returns, easy process and fast refund. Will buy again from Amazon."
5,WOW!,"May feel cheap because of the weight...but this scale is awesome. I weigh food ingredients, pinewood derby race cars, etc. Love it and have NO complaints."
3,had to return twice,"I really love this scale, I've used it through culinary school and in my home kitchen. Unfortunately I've also had to return it twice...when measuring out ingrediants I will get to the called for amount, the scale will then start going up slowly in oz or gram increment, right before my eyes. I won't be touching the scale or moving it at all, but the measurement will just keep going up. I'm hoping this was a fluke, after the first two returns and thought so for awhile, but now the third scale has started doing the same thing. I'm not sure what makes this happen since I follow the product guidelines of not stacking anything on it, and it has its own special space on the shelf where it's laid flat. Over all the scale is great when it's working properly, I just hope the next one I buy works better and for longer."
5,Great food scale!,"Simple, compact, and well-engineered. I bought this to help with meal portion control, and it has peformed exactly as advertised. What makes this worth the money, to me, is the ""tare"" feature, enabling you to easily weigh your entire meal, one item at a time ... for example:* turn on the scale, and place your plate on top* hit ""tare"" to zero out the display* add your ounces or grams desired of food item 1* hit ""tare"" to zero out the display once again* add your ounces or grams desired of food item 2* repeat for the remaining item(s)That's it ... exact every time. Great product, and I have already recommended to several others!"
4,Decent scales,"I found the scales to be decent quality for what I was going to use it for, measuring food portions. The price was right and the quality is good. I would have given it a five star but it almost has to come from heaven to get me to rate something that high. Quick shipping by Amazon is always a plus."
5,Great,This is a great very acurate and VERY lightweight machine. It is precise and east to use. There is nothing fancy its just simple and works well. Would have been nicer if it had a light switch so you can see the weight better but thats not a big deal. Just leave the kitchen light on. Enjoy!
5,Great little scale,"I got this to weigh kitchen scraps for my vermicomposting bin to be sure I wasn't overloading it. It works great. It also turned out to be sensitive enough to use for weighing yarn so that I can now easily split a skein exactly in half instead of just guessing. Those are probably not what the average person will use this for, but the point is that it's versatile. I'm very happy with this purchase."
2,Chrome doesn't equal metal,"I was disapointed that when this product arrived, I thought it would be a metal scale, instead, chrome meant the color of the scale, not the material it is made out of it. If you're looking for a cheap easy to use scale, this is it. However, if you are looking for nice stainless metal scale, then I recommend buying one from Salter."
1,Never worked.,"I am a scientist by trade and have used several similar digital scales in lab, so I was excited to use my skills to improve my cooking. Unfortunately, I got a ""dud"" with this product. The buttons were unresponsive 90% of the time, and in the few instances where I could get it to tare, the scale was incredibly inaccurate. This product is trash, don't waste your money."
5,The Little Scale that Could,"Well, I ordered this item on the referral of a friend.It is wonderful. Easy to use, clean and I love the fact that you can set it to zero when you have a plate or something on it before you weigh the food. It is very accurate for postage as well as food items. This little scale finds me going to it several times a day! Good work!"
5,Great value,"I debated about going cheaper for a scale but trusted the reviews on this one so gave it a shot. Very pleased with the accuracy, size, and that it's lightweight. I use this mostly for mail/packages. Great value."
5,great scale for dieting,"I bought this scale for portion control while dieting. It is extremely easy to use. Measures grams, ounces, pounds. It can be recalibrated to deduct the weight of a plate or bowl so you only see the weight of your food. Wipes clean easily; & looks good enough to leave sitting out on the counter."
3,small problem prevents this product from being great,"After reading other reviews, I've seen that I am not the only person who has had a problem with the battery cover breaking. I still give the product 3 stars because the broken battery cover does not actually prevent the scale from functioning properly, but it certainly lessens the perceived quality of the product. As one other reviewer said, I hate to have to tape up the battery cover on a brand-new product."
4,Nice scale,"This scale is a nice improvement over my old digital scale in terms of accuracy, and the platform is a good size for bowls. But, if I want to weigh platters or a package (to figure out postage), I've got a rig up a mirror to see the screen. In other words, large rectangular or square items cover the screen."
4,weigh it scale,"This is a pretty nice scale so far. We used it to weigh out our meat we buy in bulk. The only reason it got 4 stars instead of 5 is that the plate does not come off sperate and i realised that when i bought it. The weights all seem to be the same each time. We've weighed out 10 lbs of burger and went back and re-weighed and they was the same weight second time around. I noticed on some of the other reviews they weight would change but ours hasnt yet. Good scale just wished the plate was removable, Oh Well for the price i cant complain."
5,fantastic scale,"When I took the scale out of the box I couldn't believe how small it is.I can stand it up next to dishes, takes up hardly any space and it's readily accessable. Had an old Weight Watchers scale that took up lots of space. I like the fact that I can put any size bowl on it and zero it out and then just get the weight of my food. It measures in 1/8ths too which is nice but not necessary. I absolutely love this scale,worth every penny."
4,Good scale for the price,"We've been using this scale on a daily basis for at least 6 months and it does everything we needed it to. The batteries have not yet needed to be replaced. The tare function allows you to weigh food in any dish without doing any math. It displays weights in lbs and oz, just oz, or grams. It can be turned off after use by holding down the tare button or it will turn itself off after a few minutes. My only complaints are the stick on label around the buttons is curling up a bit and it occasionally gets a bit flaky when zeroing using the tare function. It will end up a bit off zero and then you have to hit it again. No big deal, just makes me question the long term durability. That's why I've rated this at 4 stars."
5,good scale,"love it. only flaw is it seems that no item can weigh less than .05 ounces, but I don't need that kind of accuracy. I have a glass.. baking tray? (how should I know what it is, I don't bake) that I use to wiegh all of my backpacking equip. for food I use a bowl. Clear glass is usually neccessary to see the readout."
2,Escali Primo Digita Scale,I'm not happy with this product as it has too much drift. Sometimes. Turn it on and it should read zero. But often it doesn't stay at zero. Off by one or 2 grams I could handle. But I watch slowly drift to 20 grams. Not good. Repeatedly pressing the tare button seems to help but it's annoying to have to wait for it to settle down before getting an accurate weight.
4,Escali P115c Primo digital food scale review,"It is a nice portable digital food scale, easy to use. I like the produce very much and worth my money."
5,Very accurate !,"Well, this is a very precise and economic scale, I think it should have an adapter of A/C and one more stronger battery lid."
4,Alternative uses,I use the scale to measure out epoxy resins. Since the ratio has to be perfect weighing the epoxy mix is the ideal way to get a perfect mix. It also saves the expensive epoxy because I only make the exact amount I need. I use a second one in my kitchen for the more traditional uses.
5,Love this scale,This scale is so easy to use and realiable. I love it! Plus the color matches my new kitchen.
4,Weighing In,Good product and fairly priced. Easy to operate. Only difficulty could be attempting to read the weight when a container is larger than the weighing area and blocks view of the display.
1,A mistake.,"Sadly, this item had to be returned. For whatever the reason it took too long for the scale to turn off. I found this frustrating and besides, it wasted the batteries."
5,Wife Loves it,Works as advertised. The taring function allows the weighing of individual ingredients while adding them to the mixture - very handy for sausage making.
5,A great tool for portion control.,"I always had a problem figuring what size a ""portion"" really was. This scale makes it easy. The tare feature is great!"
3,????,"It's a cute scale and I really need a scale. To make this a fair rating, I believe the batteries were bad, but I didn't have time to run up to the store to buy batteries. When it came in the mail I immediately opened it and was thrilled to see it came with batteries. I put the two AA batteries in and... numbers on the digital screen went up and down in weight. I thought it needed to warm up. I let it set then put something on it to weigh. Again with the numbers up and down. There was no way it was going to give me an accurate read. I packed it up, printed the return label and it went back the very next morning. My $ return has hit and I'm happy with how fast it all went.I would definitely give this scale a second chance, though."
3,wish it was a bit bigger,i was going to use this for breeding snakes.. but its really not that big its smaller than a mouse keypad
4,Inexpensive and Reliable,"February 25, 2010 update:This inexpensive little scale has provided perfect service for over 2 years. It is used so frequently it has a permanent place on my counter-top - despite its inexpensive ""plastic metal"" appearance.Original review:I have used this weigh scale for over a year without a problem. It works very well and the tare feature simplifies weighing items held in any suitable container.If the display was at 45 degrees rather than horizontal, it would be far easier to read when weighing items placed in/on larger diameter containers (dinner plates, etc.) Also, despite the fact that it has regularly handled weights up to 10 lb without incident, the scale weighs little, and does not seem to be substantially built.These are the only reasons it does not merit 5 stars."
1,Dead upon arrival,"When I received the scale and set it up, it just reads 0. Returning for replacement."
5,Very happy with this purchase!,"This is a very nice scale - very easy to use and very nice to look at, too! Nice and small so that it doesn't take up so much space on the countertop."
5,Great little scale,"This scale was recommended to me and I agree that it is a great scale at a good price. It appears to do everything you'd expect, comes ready to use out of the box and is easy to use. It's perfect for daily use in our kitchen (and home office). I would certainly consider this a suitable gift for any amateur chef."
5,love this scale,"LOVE it, love it , love it. This small scale is great. Does the job and looks great, lightweight. I am doing Weight Watchers and it does the job with grams, oz, and lbs. Worth the money."
3,Great scale but....,"This is a very easy to use scale. It is a very good basic scale that can handle up to 5KG. The weight platform is not removable, so beware of water getting underneath the plateform. That would be my only concern."
5,"Great value, accurate and user friendly","I have been looking for a decent kitchen scale for a while. After reading all the reviews and the discount value, I decide to give it a try. It looks very nice and complement my kitchen, accurate and very easy to use. You can convert from ozs to grams and vice versa. There is also a feature where you put the container on the scale, push the button and the scale will turn back to zero so you can accurately weight the contents without doing any maths. It also turns off automatically if not in use. Nice price for all the features."
4,David Ware is Amazing!,"I first heard David Ware live a few weeks ago and since then I've sought out recordings by him. I haven't yet found anything that matched the intensity, lyricism and emotional impact of the live performance by Godspellized comes close. Both versions of the title track are amazing for the power of Ware's playing and the variety of sounds he extracts from his sax. The band is quite good but Shipp has really improved and you really should try to catch these guys live."
4,Better than Bobs,"Tastes good. Mixes easily, even with a spoon. Dissolves well in coffee.All other powdered milks make distasteful lumps, and require a good mixing in a blender."
2,Greed,"This product itself is fabulous; creamy with a good taste. However, the price plus shipping is greed, pure and simple. Shame on the seller and shame on Amazon for not policing the retailers who chose to take advantage of the consumer. BTW this comes in a plastic bag that you can seal, The problem is that the bag can split at the seams. The box was a much better package."
1,"Good milk for non fat, but way overpriced!","Carnation has always been the American dry milk choice, but this price is way high! Check out Nido, which is dry whole milk:Nestle Nido Milk Powder, Imported, 14-Ounce Cans (Pack of 3)and also is a great (good fat) coffee creamer and makes awesome bread and mashed potatoes!"
1,Tiny Tiny Toy,"Although this is a very cute toy it is extremely small. It is not at all the way that it is portrayed in the images. I do not recommend this if you are wanting a toy that your child can hold and sleep with, this is more of a ""pocket baby""."
3,HAD POTENTIAL,"The story line was going well, but lost steam. The book was more about Poppy and Griffin (which was lovely) and sugar making (too much time given to it) than the ""accidental woman"". I did enjoy the book, but wish it gave more details about how Heather/Lisa got to where is she was. If it were written as a love story between Poppy and Griffin or stayed more on course with the Heather/Lisa plot, I would have given it 4/5 stars."
4,A good read.,"I bought this book because of an excerpt I read in another of Delinsky's books and the excerpt involved Micah and Heather. Though this was a wonderful book, I was disappointed that it didn't focus more on what was going on between Micah and Heather. We never really got to know them because not much of this book was focused on their relationship. Yes, he loved her, but they had a lot of issues to deal with and none were ever dealt with. They never had one heart to heart talk through the entire book and I would have liked to see more of what went on between these two, like we did with Poppy and Griffin. I did enjoy the book, however, and I have to say it's my favorite Delinsky book so far. But Micah was the perfect hero and I thought he should have had more of a storyline other than making syrup."
4,Very good,"Even though the pity party was a little much. I had a mother who was confined to a wheelchaire and she never indulged in self pity. And she didn't have a house to herself or every convinience a phisically disabled person could want! The character Poppy, a returnee from Lake News, was originally painted as upbeat and cheerful so I was really excited for the arrival of this book. It left a little something wanting.I appreciate all the difficulties that the characters went through, and the quaint setting was rewarding in itself. Overall a good read, but it could have been better."
1,way too sappy,"I bought this off amazon's bargain rack as I've been searching for new authors to expand my horizons a little. Set in New Hampshire, I found the story telling interesting through the first 100 pages as I was roped into the suspense around Heather Malone and the ""is-she-or-isn't-she-a-wanted murderer-on-the-run"" drama. Then the story got off-track with 250 pages of maple sap making lessons, snowmobile accidents, siblings disappearing, and finally more maple sap...I could go on but I won't waste anymore of your time like this book did with mine."
2,Another almost boring book by Barbara Delinsky,"This is the second book by Barbara Delinsky that I read. Once again the story is pretty good.But everything that is worth saying is repeated so many times... It is so obvious that the author had 'so many pages' requirement for this book.I did not get to the very end of the book. Nor did I finish her first book (A woman next door). Why bother with her books then? Well, I don't believe that one book is enough to form an opinion about a writer and his/her creative work. However I think this second attempt to read and enjoy her books did it for me!"
3,It is an okay story,She has written much better stories. This one you can walk away and come back to later without missing a thing.
3,Slow and repitious,My first Barbara Delinsky book was The Woman Next Door and I absolutely adored that book. The second BD book I read was Family Tree which I thought was pretty bad until I started to read this one. I'm almost half way through and this book is just not getting to the point. Conversations and thoughts are repitious and is getting really old. Some of the characters actions are idiotic. Barbara has some good ideas forstories but is just not able to pull these ideas off. Very disappointing.
3,Critique,"Normally Barbara Delinsky writes mostly better than average,unfortunately I believe that she hasa missed the mark with this title ""An Accidental Woman"".I found the story uninteresting and preditable.However this may be just a flash in the pan and I will continue to buy and read her books."
3,Quite good until the end!,"Not a bad book at all - I quite like Barbara Delinsky's style or 'voice' of writing, and I really liked that her main character was a woman in a wheel chair!! I liked how it was set in New England during 'sugaring' season (always curious about how maple syrup is made!!) but the ending blows it. Barbara ties up every loose end into a nice little package and everyone/everything has a happy ending. I think it would have been a much more interesting book had some things NOT ended on a positive note - would have been more realistic.But it does grip you,hold your attention. I read it in a weekend and will try another Delinsky book."
4,good size bowl,light lavender in color. okay in size to hold my homemade gumbo at our Mardi Gras party. Stiff enough plastic to hold its shape well even with hot soup in it.
1,Horrible Product!,"This product is junk, my podium came in all scratched up and after a month it lost it's sturdiness. On top of that, the owner of the company is absolutely horrible to deal with. I do not recommend this company nor the stress that comes with dealing with them."
5,birthday preent,"this is a birthday preent for my son in law for june 26, 2013I got it now becaue i found it and he is a hugh nebreka fan"
3,The plastic packaging around the barbecue set was ripped open!!,I was a litt upset to find that the plastic packaging around the barbecue set was already ripped open in two places. I was giving this as a gift to my father for Christmas and it looked as though I bought it used. Fortunately the barbecue set itself looked brand new so we just explained the situation to my parents.
5,wonderful,It was a gift for a huge Ohio State fan and he loved them. Use them immediately on his brand new grill.
5,Man's Dream Gift,"If you are looking for a gift for your die-hard sports fan, you can't go wrong with this grill set!"
4,Great gift!,Gave this to my Grandpa-in-law for secret santa this year. He is UofM alumni and LOVED it. The packaging is a big cheap but overall nothing to really complain about.
5,Great item,Purchased this as a gift and he was very happy with it. Haven't had it very long and I hope it holds up well.
5,Nice Quality,"I bought this as a groomsmen's gift for my Hawkeye football fan friend. The quality is nice, the Hawkeye on the spatula is a nice touch. I'm glad I checked on amazon because this was twice the price on every other site."
1,Historical travesty,"Why is it that works of history aimed at children(both fiction and non-fiction) are nearly always so incredibly historically inaccurate? ""The Queen's Own Fool"" is one of the worst of this type that I have read. The history (especially the parts dealing with Mary's marriages to Darnley and Bothwell) have no connection to the truth whatsoever. Yolen's depiction of Bothwell, in particular, comes off like something from a bad comic book. I would have thought that even the most casual historians would have gotten past this old stereotype of him as a scheming villain who had to force Mary into marrying him. (What a joke!) By all means, children should learn history (especially the history of someone as fascinating as Mary Queen of Scots) but this is hardly the way to do it! If that wasn't bad enough, the book is very poorly written--it has little value even as literature. What else can I say? I would have given this book no stars at all if I could have!"
5,One of the Best!!!,"I checked this book out from a local library and fell in love with it. It is full of suspense and keeps you turning the pages. I could barely put the book down. After I finished it I wanted to pick it back up and read it again! I enjoyed this book because it had a mixture of humor, love, and suspense."
4,"Good, but not great","This book was quite good, but quite lengthy. It seemed to go on longer than it needed to or started to soon, or maybe it just had to many details. Though it was very enticing, it was not a first pick. I have read other books by Yolen and have found she cannot find just the right length. Her books are good, but not quite right."
2,Low view of Presbyterians and Scots (but probably great for Catholics),"As a homeschooling mother, I'm always on the lookout for accurate historical fiction that will engage my children. As I have read and enjoyed other books by this author, I had high hopes for The Queen's Own Fool.Unfortunately, I won't be passing this one on to my daughter. I could say that I don't approve of her biased treatment of the subject, but it's fairer to say that her bias is different than my bias.The author clearly has a low opinion of Scots and Presbyterianism. If you're a fan of Knox, you won't care for this book.If you're looking for historical fiction relating to the Huguenots, I recommend Huguenot Garden. For a better treatment of Scots and Presbyterianism, I wholeheartedly recommend Douglas Bond's series."
3,The Queen's Fool,"This was a unique approach to telling the story of Mary Queen of Scots. As someone who likes history, I found it interesting. But, I don't think it would hold the attention of most young adults, the target audience."
5,A Can Not Miss,"Wonderful! Great! Super! There are so many words to describe this book. Nicola, a peasant is performing in front of the queen. The queen loves her act and asks Nicola to stay with her and become her fool, a respectabel position. Nicola remains loyal to the queen through marriage, death, marriage, divorce, and through just about anything you can imagine. From the 5th page to the last it captivates you. Do not miss this!"
2,Old part,"This is the old design without the metal skeleton. If you got the dreaded manifold leak and want to be sure you dont have to do the job again, the improved part adressing the plastic deterioration, then you want part # 98000T"
3,The Eater's Guide,"It is an interesting introduction to Chinese dishes but I was a bit disappointed because it uses old caracters, not the simlpified ones used in China. It was not indicated anywhere, I have realized it only after receiving the book."
1,You may have fun if you are already fluent in Chinese,"I am not. The book is very well written (in the first 7 pages that I managed to read) but the print quality is poor to the point of unreadable. It would work for English, but try figuring out something to remember about character for eel on page 170 (the dictionary half of the book) or about anything on ""delicious vegetarian dishes"" menu example on page 30.I though of just tearing out the first 14 pages to take with me to China. I still may, it may be useful for a dozen of most common ingredients shown there. But the rest of the book is unreadable.Yes, I figured out that the author is dead (and I have no complaints to the text, I love it in fact) so it can't really be rewritten. But printing is crap (in case I haven't made my point yet).Guys, can you look for a better publisher?"
4,"While it may look like Greek to you, this in really Chinese","Many a time I have eaten in a Chinese restaurant and been totally ""closed out"" of the posted menu specials because I am illiterate in Chinese. This little book breaks the language code and enables me to see that the daily special, written in Chinese characters and pasted to the wall, is a better culinary choice and less expensive than the standard English choices. So if you are tired of the same same of ""one from column A and two from column B""--this is the essential language guide to have."
1,McCawley's revenge,"James McCawley was the most arrogant and closed minded person I ever met or ate with at table. This book has a several massive flaws. First, it deals only with the classical characters, not the simplified ones. Second, his dictionary uses his own made up system for counting strokes, not the usual one. Third, he uses copies of several menus from restaurants that are now closed. I even think his definition of ""Buddha Jumps Wall"" is wrong. Of course, he was able to break things down into a system, so it retains some value."
5,'All night everything slowing down'.... I wish I was yours,"""Strangers nobody knows we love I catch your eyes in the dark..One look relives the memory... remember me the way I used to be...""oooohhhhhh devine Those lines saw me drinking and reminicing and imagining and longing, what a beautiful song, This album is lovely and regarding the trilogy debate I agree the real trilogy is seventeen seconds/Faith and Pornography"
3,(three and a half stars) curiously muffled vocals,"""Seventeen Seconds"" has a very unusual overall sound consisting of an almost metronomic drum and bass, muffled vocals from Robert Smith, and Smith's subtle, striking electric guitar. Two songs dominate the album, the catchy, highly danceable ""Play for Today,"" and the incomparable ""A Forest"" with its compelling bass line and mystical lyrics (""The girl was never there. It's always the same. Running towards nothing, again and again and again and again . . ."").Other than these two songs, the remainder of the songs on the album, though certainly decent, are somewhat lifeless and undistinguishable. I'm not sure why Robert Smith chose the album to be engineered so that his voice and the lyrics he sings are minimalized, because these are usually such strong qualities of the band. However, ""A Forest"" and, to a slightly lesser extent ""Play for Today,"" certainly make ""Seventeen Seconds"" worthwhile."
5,Classic Post-Punk Album,"Seventeen Seconds is one of those albums that works best as an album, with most of the songs functioning to set a specific mood. The centerpieces of the album are undoubtedly A Forest, a classic Cure track, and Play For Today, but everything else works to paint the stark, bleak, minimalist soundscape of the album. The album sounds like its cover picture--a dreary autumn day in the woods. So it is best not to shuffle tracks, but to just listen to the album all the way through to be pulled into the soundscape. It only takes about 35 minutes to do so, so it is a rather short album. This is a definite classic of the late 70s/early 80s post-punk scene and is highly recommended not merely to Cure fans as an essential work but also to fans of any of that scene's bands."
3,A Flawed Masterwork,"Seventeen Seconds is rightly considered to be the real jumping off point of the trademark sound that continues up to the present(Three Imaginary Boys wasn't very indicative). So, this is a must have, being remastered and everything. And a bonus disc. Oh joy!Buy this, but don't put your original up on Amazon or eBay. The bonus tracks are worth the price, but the first disc is far from improved. In fact, it's much worse. Yes, the playing is cleaned up some, but the vocals are very quiet. Too quiet. So far back in the mix that new ears could think it to be an all instrumental album unless they're really concentrating."
5,A blissfully stark performance,"Ok, I'm giving 17 Seconds the 5 star treatment because I love the Cure. Not recommended for casual fans because the minimalist approach taken during these sessions runs the risk of turning off those listeners who are hooked on the fuller sounds of 'Disintegration' and 'Wish'.The opening piano driven 'A Reflection' sets the tenebrous tone present throughout 17 Seconds. It's creepy and unforgettable. The next 2 songs, 'Play For Today' and 'Secrets', pick up the tempo while further carving out a desolate landscape.Robert Smith never deviates from the overall theme of starkness.If you want to get a feel for the early days of the Cure and 80's goth this is an excellent choice. It's short so you might consider the deluxe version, which I have not heard but expect to be on par with the other excellent deluxe versions of the Cure catalog that have been recently released."
5,Mood music at its best,"Seventeen Seconds is definitely one of the best Cure albums ever made. The production is nothing short of brilliant. Every instrument and sound is crisp and clear. This is a perfect listen for a cold, dark winter day in a forest. It's probably best enjoyed through headphones or turned up really loud on a stereo. My personal favorites are Secrets, At Night, Three, A Forest, and the title track. Anyone with even a tiny bit of interest in the cure should buy this CD."
5,i love the bonus disc!!!!!!!,"now i have to get all the reissues, just lovely, esp im a cult hero, im hoping we will get every version of all these songs like they did for sum classic miles davis records(bithces brew, jack johnson) i cant get enough early cure. i love rhino!!!"
4,nice and dark,"""A Forest"" and ""Play For Today"" are among the songs on this album that are deep and meditative in their darkness. This is a great album."
3,Has Potential But:,"Great reviews influenced my purchase of Lightroom and indeed the software has great potential. First: A word of warning; check out the problems that people are having with this software ([...]). I wanted to use Lightroom with Elements 3. When I installed Lightroom, I couldn't get a decent print from either program (I was getting perfect prints before from Elements),now,to much magenta. I had to un-install all my Epson printer programs, re-install just the drivers, and download and update new ICC profiles from Epson, then had to re-install Elements as a repair. I can now get a decent print from Lightroom. When printing, be sure to use your profile for your paper and I use Rendering: Perceptual."
4,Approaching the Speed of Light,"Lightroom runs very fast on my minimum configured Mac PowerBook. I haven't used the software very much, nor have I read the manual, yet I have been able to process RAW files acceptably well. It definitely sits on the shelf with the big boys. Other products I use are: Capture One by Phase One, Nikon Capture and Capture NX and of course Photoshop. I haven't tried Aperture because it is a memory hog. As you would imagine, different results are achieved by each process of the same image. Each product can do something the other can't. When I have an image or a project that is very important to me, I will take the time to find the one I like best. The point is, don't expect this to be the perfect tool that does it all. Most people are going to fall in love with Lightroom, but forget the hype. In my opinion, 2 things can definitely be said: It's fast as grease lightning, and it's fun."
1,Crash after crash,"In wandering around the web, I find I am not the only person to experience crash after crash upon importing (from Photoshop Elements 5). When importing, Lightroom ""thinks"" for a long time (that's fine, and they do warn you it can be slow), but then the program crashes before it gets even close to finishing the import.About the rest of the program? I don't know. Too frustrated just trying to get it up and running."
1,Buy this product at your own peril,"This software does not come close to the once-upon-a =-time quality of Adobe products. it is shot full of bugs overall. Not only does it cause your Photoshop system to quit working, it affects your entire Mac operating System. Adobe knows this is true because they try to cover up with a several page discussion about how operating systems, not Lightroom, can cause problems. Their approach of blaming someone else is shameful. The design of the product is marginal; almost impossible to read the dark grey print on black backgrounds. It is slower than anything I have ever seen. I could go on and on but it only raises my blood pressure . I have spent the entire weekend fixing the computer programs broken by this ""half done"" system.. If you buy it, you will waste a lot of time like I did. The software is going back to Amazon tomorrow morning. Amazon, shame on you for selling such a poor product."
1,Be careful to check system requirements,"I gave Adobe Photoshop Lightroom only one star because I was not able to install the program in my computer which runs Windows 2000. During installation, the program returned a message saying it required Windows XP to run. Here are the Windows system requirements listed on the box:Microsoft Windows XP with Service Pack 2Intel Pentium 4 Processor768MB of RAM (1GB recommended)1GB of available hard-disk space1024 x 768 screen resolutionCD-ROM driveThose requirement seem very restrictive. No mention of Microsoft Vista. So buyer beware or you may be in for a system upgrade or an unusable program."
3,Useless for Nikon raw (.NEF),"I purchased this software soon after I acquired my Nikon D200. After importing my pictures into LR, the photos appeared dull and lifeless. I explored whether I was alone in my impression on the Adobe LightRoom Support Forum and found a plethora of posts documenting similar experiences. Adobe seems to have a lot of excuses which mostly blame Nikon.Bottom line is that LightRoom is dead in the water if you want to import and manage Nikon Raw (NEF) files. I went ahead and purchased Apple Aperture which I've found to be an awesome piece of work. Yes, it requires cutting edge hardware (MacIntel and lots of RAM), but if that is available it is an amazingly powerful program. It comes with a DVD training and tutorial disc which can put a user into expert status within an hour. Aperture- Five stars. LightRoom- Reject."
1,"Using a PC - so many issues, i give up.","I was very excited to use this software. Unfortunately, using a PC, I had too many issues with it to continue. First, while importing RAW files from a Canon 5D Mark 2, about half of the images couldn't be imported according to Lightroom because they were ""corrupt"". OK. Fine. So I upgraded to 1.42 and then when I went into develop mode to alter the images that did import correctly, the program crashed repeatedly. I downgraded to version 1.3 and still the same. The other reviews say it, but it bears repeating - Lightroom v1 to 1.42 on the PC is too buggy to sell as a complete product. I am very disappointed."
4,Great Photography Workflow software!,"Very nice user interface. Has great tools that are easy to use to categorize and keep track of large numbers of photos, and to make adjustments to the photos themselves. Most useful features for adjustments for my use are those that control white balance and exposure. This software meets 90% of my needs for managing photos taken with my digital SLR camera. The reason that I rated Lightroom at 4 verses 5 stars is the software is expensive as compared to competitor products. IMHO the slick user interface and ease of use still make it the best value in this category of software. My comparisons with other like software were made using trial versions I downloaded to my computer."
5,carlos b,We use this in our studio everday. We are professinal photographers and it's easy to use. Awesome.
3,Great early version.,"After using it for a few months now there are a few quirks that I wish were not there or done differently. I'm sure this program is only going to get better. Mesh's real well with Photoshop7.1, hence, same vendor. That's what sold me over Aperature."
5,Gotta love it.,"I know this may have been just another way for Adobe to make more money, as they had many of these features in Photoshop that they have now migrated to Lightroom. But, honestly, Adobe makes great programs, and Lightroom is one of those ""gotta have it"" products. They're not always as intuitive as they could be, but then again, Adobe makes professional tools that are arguably the best products on the market for media editing, creation, & development.I was in on the beta version of Lightroom, and once I tried it, there was no doubt I'd buy it when it released. It was the piece I need most in my toolset: a way to easily catalog my photos as well as do some developing without impacting the original picture. That's Lightroom in a nutshell.The only downside may be the price. Some may say $200 is a little steep, but the time it saves me importing and managing my photos more than makes up for cost.I'm totally hooked."
4,Batch Processing,"This product helped out the work flow 10 fold. It made almost all my post corrections and enhancements faster. God bless batch processing. Now I can't say LT is better or worst than Apples's Apeture, but for $199 and complete intergration with Photoshop - I couldn't beat it."
3,"Paper, Paper and more Paper",Well first of all the rolls were larger then I thought which is a good thing since the cost was higher than I'd like to pay. My daughter loves drawing and though the rolls were wider then her eisel she just rips off a piece and clips it too her board and enjoys making large masterpieces.
4,Bought it for my 3 year old Boy.,I bought this for my son to go with the easel set I got him for Christmas. I received it the day after I ordered it which was nice because I wasn't expecting it that soon. The paper I think it pretty thick. The only real problem I have with it is that every time I try to cut off the paper (wet or dry) it always tears. There is never a perfectly cut off sheet even if I try to tear it slowly.
5,Perfect for the M&D Easel...stock up!,"If your kids love painting, writing, or drawing nearly as much as my kids do you need to get the paper roll for the easel. It fits perfectly on the Melissa & Doug easel stand and is better than using the dry erase board, which inevitably gets marked up with un-erasable colors.I have not, however, purchased it from Amazon at the[...........] price which I think is way too much. I buy it locally for [...........] per roll."
1,Replacement Easel Paper Roll,"I was mislead into believe that this Replacement Easel Paper Roll 18"" would be a suitable replacement for my daughter's ""Rose Art, Smart Easel"". This paper does not fit on the arm that holds the easel paper. The whole in the middle it too small to fit. I had to cut each sheet so that my daughter can use the paper. I'm not impressed with the false advertising. I sent a message to the manufacturer of the paper and to no one's surprise I have not heard back from them.Look elsewhere and unless you want the extra work of pre-cutting each sheet don't waste your money."
3,Works great! Not the most comfortable.,"If it was more comfortable to use it would get 5 stars. The stick is easy to use, plug and play with no troubles. My only complaint is that it is not very comfortable to use. It is adjustable, but for me it is not comfortable in any configuration. I came to this stick from an old Microsoft Sidewinder which is perfectly molded to your hand and non fatiguing, but doesn't work with Win XP."
1,Fade from Gaming,"Just bought this stick. Great look and feel. Good action on throttle and x and y axis. BIG Problem-Saitek knows about it. In MechWarrior4 all version and Need for Speed most version, tends to ""fade"" to the left. When twist is used, that feature also ""pins"" to the left and cannot be corrected. The updated driver available on Microsoft's website does not completely correct the problem. It just fades alittle slower. Saitek tech support has not replied to my emails to this point. I think I will try one of the Logitech products or Microsoft's. MS is much more expensive, but they always work."
1,do not buy,"This joystick has a good grip and feel, but when using it there are a few major problems. It constantly stops responding and needs to be recalibrated. And it always drifts to the left when it is working after moving it. I am currently looking for a new one because of this joysticks poor quality."
3,"Drifts to the left, a BIG annoyance.","I recently purchased this joystick because I saw it at BestBuy awhile ago and I liked the feel and look of it. A month later I decided to buy it.When it arrived, I installed the drivers, I loaded up World War 2 Online, and noticed instantly that it drifts to the left, even when you are not touching it! I went to the support forums for the Saitek Cyborg Evo and noticed that quite a few other people are having the problem of the joystick drifting to the left and the calibration not saving. You have to recalibrate the joystick each time you restart and for some people, including me, it does not fix the problem of the drifting.I also noticed while viewing the support forums that some Saitek joysticks also had the same problem in the past.Its a good joystick, but I would stay away until the left drift problem and calibration saving problem is gone."
3,"Good, but not for flight sims...","The good: Numerous buttons on the stick plus 6 more on the base, nice feel to the stick - highly adjustable and works equally well for lefties and righties. Twist the stick for rudder control.The bad: Saitek has ruined an otherwise great product by placing the throttle control in an unusable position (at the bottom center of the base, right under the arm that is using the joystick itself. Its basically impossible to use the throttle and the joystick at the same time, without it being highly ackward as you'll tend to have to cross your hands. Also, a missing feature on the throttle is the afterburner detente notch.Bottom line - nice joystick, cool looking lights, but if you play flight simulators and want this stick for the throttle, look elsewhere for a single stick solution that has the throttle on the side (much more usable) or go for a two controller solution, like Saitek's X52."
4,Ergonomics deficient but works well,"The ergonomics need improvement, but everything functions properly. I loved my MS Sidewinder 3D Pro but many new PCs obsoleted the 15-pin joystick port, so I had to buy a USB joystick. The Saitek had the same ""swivel"" rudder control that I loved on the Sidewinder. The RAH-66 Comanche was reported to have the same type of rudder control before DoD axed the program, so apparently the higher-ups liked the control interface as well."
4,Sooooo nice! Not heavy enough though.,This is sooo easy to set up and so versatile. Great joystick. The only problem with it is that its hard to keep it on the table because it picks up so easily.
2,Calibrate? Again?,"Okay, fade to the left is a pain.. But what's worse is that the twist axis is based on an odd number, so there isn't a centerpoint... after a twist in any direction, the calibration on this stick starts to go, then keeps going and going and going... Don't like saving a game to re-calibrate my stick. I am online now shopping for a replacement. Suggestions? Anyone?"
2,Doesn't stay centered,"I've had this for a long time - only because I don't ""fly"" that often. After my last computer rebuild, I decided to get back into it with FSX. (Note - I had zero problems getting working in Win7) I then remembered why I had shelved it before. I can fly normal for awhile, do some maneuvers. Move the joystick back to center and I'm doing a tailspin. To fly straight and level, I then have to hold the joystick back and to the side. Doesn't make for comfortable use."
5,Excellent Joystick,"I use this joystick to play Il-2 FB. The yaw, thrust and pointer hat controls come in very useful thereThe self calibrating feature of the joystick is very convenient.The buttons on the head of the stick are a little too close together.I don't make use of the base buttons or the adjustable head.The joystick is large and sturdy."
4,Does what I wanted it for.,Have had this item for over a year now with no complaints. Works well for me and was easy to use.
4,Leo in Europe,"This pretty much rounded out my complete collection of Leo's recordings. Playing to this European audience, I can only guess by the audience's responses that it was a bit of a subdued atmosphere. His playing was spot on as usual, but there was no typical monologue which is so characteristic of his live performances here in the USA. I would recommend this to anyone who admires his talents as much as I do."
4,Leo Lottke Live in Europe,"The CD was listed used but came in very good shape, happy with that. As far as the content I was also happy with sound quality. What I miss is the applause from the audience and Leo telling stories. After reading the notes it appears they went to great lenghts to cut out as much of the audience as possible. Strange for a live album, but I guess the producer had his idea of what live means. Maybe to showcase the artist performance but for Leo Kottke what happens around the music just as entertaining. I recommend his other live albums especially ""Live"" and his DVD documentary ""Home and Away"" for his live performance experience. ""My Feet are Smiling"" is also live."
5,UB Black Frame - Smoke Lens Classic Aviator 3-Pack,"Great price! Thin metal frames and just substantial enough. Would not tolerate abuse. Lens do not cause flair nor extra reflections, are not too dark, and distortion free. When I loose or destroy the six pair I purchased I will buy more."
3,Not bad at all,"I had no problems with these glasses. Cheap price, very functional. Its justwhat you want for everyday use."
1,"Non standard recording, & can't be played on your computer","While I love Don McLean, it is unfortunate that this recording was done by BGO Records. They are trying to stop you from making/distributing MP3 files of their music by recording it in a non-standard format. You're not getting redbook audio on this CD. You can't play this CD on your computer. Further, they don't tell you this anywhere in the packaging. I have returned this CD and will not buy ANY music produced by BGO until such time as they get their act together, and give me what I'm paying for."
5,THE Great unknown Live McLean album,"Don McLean / Solo / Don McLean Live (1976 release): Arriving as it did at the beginning of the Punk vs. Disco era, this double album, consisting of Don playing live with nearly no accompaniment except his own guitar or banjo, fell so far under the radar that most people don't know of it's existence. However, this is a Masterpiece effort. This one has terrific live versions of ""American Pie"", ""Vincent"", ""Babylon"", and ""Homeless Brother"". It also has such unique songs as the comic/tragic ""Legend of Andrew McCrew"" and the hilarious ""Georgie's Lost His Penker"". Don tells some great stories along the way as well. This live double CD deserves a Sixth Star! Highly Recommended."
3,fast paced yet tedious,"INSPIRED BY THE SUCCESS OF ''DELIVERANCE'',THIS BOOK WAS PUBLISHED IN THE LATE SEVENTIES BY THE NOW DEFUNCT PLAYBOY PRESS.LIKE MOST TITLES THEY RELEASED,THIS IS MODERATELY INTERESTING,BUT NO CLASSIC.ANYWAY,SUBSTITUTING FOR BACKWOODS MUTANTS HERE ARE TWO SADISTIC EX-CONS WHO STALK THE VICTIMS WITH HIGH POWERED RIFLES THROUGH MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN.THERE ARE A COUPLE OF MEMORABLE SCENES, BUT NOT ENOUGH TO MAINTAIN A HEAVY LEVEL OF SUSPENSE.........IF YOU CAN FIND A COPY OF THIS BOOK,YOU MIGHT WANT TO READ IT IF YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH DELIVERANCE,BUT ALL OTHERS WILL PROBABLY BE BORED."
2,Don't Believe the Color,"This item was supposed to be dove grey and it is ivory. Not even a hint of grey. Though I am using it, but not on the phone I intended to."
5,Everything I Needed to Get Started,"With no cheer experience, and a MS squad with a coach need - this became an excellent and COMPLETE resource."
4,"Great, but sounds a little different","It was great for me to hear this album again after an absence of about 18 years (my original vinyl is long gone). But if my memory of the original serves me right, then this newly remastered version contains some slight variations from the original sound. For instance, on ""Hey Good Lookin'"", Linda Ronstadt's vocals are toned way down at one point. Similarly, the mandolin on ""Ripplin' Water"" is nearly imperceptible. Perhaps my hearing (or memory) has faded a bit with age, but I could swear the sound on the original was cleaner. (Anyone else hear this?) Nonetheless, this is truly a great work."
4,it works,products work as expected. arrived in the correct color. i'd buy it again if i needed one. 3 more words.
2,Coil Phone Cord,"The cord was too short for what I needed. To get the 12-foot extension I was looking for, I found I actually needed a 25-foot cord. However, there was nothing actually wrong with the GE product and it arrived on time."
3,Did not fit properly,"I was hooking up an old pc to my main TV to watch Hulu. So I bought these modular plugs HDMI, coax, rj45 and this telephone connector. All fit the holes in the face plate except this one. I had to file it down quite a bit for it to fit. I live in the mountains so running to the Home Depot was not an option for a two dollar part. It was frustrating."
5,Unique Concept,"Craig Evans has dedicated his book ""Metal Sculpture and the mind of art"" to the reader. ""May you find your creation "". It is a unique gesture. What follows is unique too. The book describes precisely and exhaustively the creation of metal sculpture. Of particular interest is the care the author has taken to include safety measures.The observations on art and creativity are touching some chord in the reader. Yes, I would like to ""take one idea, and bring it to life"" (i.e.), I'm inspired to write my first book.Thank you Craig Evans."
2,misleading,I was disappointed with this purchase. Nowhere on the description did it state that this was not the complete book...it was a simplified version.
5,A fourth grade student review,"Pollyanna is about a girl, her aunt Polly and Dr. Chilton. Pollyanna went to get medicine for aunt Polly and right when she ran across the street a speeding car came rushing around the corner and hit Pollyanna hard enough to knock he out. Then, she went to the hostpital and found out that she was paralized and that she could never walk again. But then Dr. Chilton walked in and said he knew a doctor that could help her walk again. If you want to find out if she can walk again you'll have to read this book. ~ cookies N' cream"
1,"Pollyanna - audio book on CD, read by Rebecca Burns","Rebecca Burns kills this beloved classic with her dull, lifeless, monotone reading. After listening for 5 minutes, my 12 year old daughter's immediate reaction was: ""Whoever's reading this sounds like she's really not interested in the story at all! The voice sounds like a computerized voice.""If you want this story on audio, find another version with a different reader."
4,"Simplicity, Optimism and Joy","I first read this book more than twenty years ago and recently found my thoughts returning to it as I pondered what's available today for my own daughter. Pollyanna is simple by today's standards, but contains the kind of genuine optimism and morality that our children sorely need. Author Eleanor Porter passed away in 1920 after writing a couple of sequels, but the remainder of the books in the series--there are eleven altogether, most out of print--are treasures. Your child will enjoy reading about the excitement of Pollyanna's adventures in such different times (in Pollyanna's Western Adventure, Pollyanna's is one of the first families with a ""radio set"") and you can enjoy the discussions that ensue as your child asks for explanations of life in the teens and twenties. If you enjoyed the Little House books by Laura Ingalls Wilder, you will love these. Classic american childhood fare."
3,Awesome,Fun and ok kind of boring not really for nine and under not quite understanding because of western talk ok
5,Frigging awesome,Mage The hero discovered is an intresting look at king Arthur. I had not read the story back when it was originally printed but had read Matt's Grendal stories. I had always wanted to read the Mage books but had been unable to get my hand on a copy until now. Wow. A great story if you like Matt Wagner stuff you'll dig this series. The hard back version is very nice and the art is just what you expect from Mr. Wagner. A great story.
4,Great product with pros and cons.,Pros: Smells delicious; heats to the perfect temperature. Cons: Not enough wax provided to meet the minimum amount required for use. Buy extra wax! Not big enough for feet over ladies size 7. Would give 5 stars if more wax was provided with product.
5,wonderful,This is a great item to have in your home for dry hands or feet. With the addition of the mitts and bootees..leaves your hands and feet real soft and like having a massage on them.
5,WHAT DID THE 9/11 HIJACKERS DO IN FLORIDA IN THE MONTHS LEADING UP TO THAT FATEFUL DAY?,"If you believe every thing in the mainstream media about 9/11, you may be in for a shock. The author documents many facts about the movement and activities of the 9/11 hijackers in Florida in the months before 9/11. While Bush was receiving multiple warning that A LARGE TERRORIST ATTACK ON THE UNITED STATES WAS ON ITS WAY IN THE NEAR FUTURE, AND ignoring those warnings, the 9/11 hijackers were running around in Florida like they ran the place. In fact, some of the hijackers were for a while living only 20 miles from where Bush stayed the night of September 10th-11th, which was on an island near Sarasota, the same island where Katherine Harris, the woman who helped Bush steal the 2000 election, lived. The facts the author uncovered will surprise you."
5,very quick witted,this woman has style and witt for days.she gives up the flavor on this disc.it kept me rolling.she is a genius.the female redd foxx so you know it's tight.
5,Superior cat food,"My 12 year-old Tonkinese cat not only loves this food, but she seems to feel better and be healthier after a few weeks on it. We'll see if there is enough fiber to keep the hairballs away, but for now I'm very pleased with this food. If hairballs become a problem, I'll mix in some of the Royal Canin intense hairball food."
4,Good Eatin' for the Elders,"I mix this with the Royal Canin Intense Hairball 34 as well as a no-grain variety - I figure I am covering all the bases this way and not giving the cats more protein than they can handle. They like the Indoor Mature, and the shape is designed to make it easy for an older cat to chew. I wish RC offered this in a larger bag but I'll keep getting the 5.5 lb. size until they do. It's the best formula for older cats that I have found - and best liked by my cats."
5,Cat Food,Cats (2) love it. Also a best price anywhere. Arrived right on time. Will buy again when needed. Ordering on line is yhe best.
2,vomit due to grains,"I was sold that this product is great for gereatric cats, but not really. My 17 yr old cat can not keep this down. Vet feels because of the unknown source of grains she may continue to vomit up this food. If your cat is real old like mine I suggest trying a grain free food. Cats are carnivores so grains are only fillers in these types of foods. 2 stars for fast shipping"
2,View at your own risk.,"I'm a big Timothy Oliphant fan. However,this movie lacks in so many different ways I can't even begin to recount them. The only thing that would make this movie worth watching is if it were free."
2,Forewarned,"There are bank heist movies in which everything is meticulously planned. They have a detailed blueprint of the bank which they pore over. There's a steely-eyed safe cracker with a satchel full of sophisticated equipment. They rehearse the heist using a carefully constructed scale model. They synchronize their watches when the caper begins.Well, that's not ""High Life."" This film has a lame-brained scheme involving ATM's. Hasty planning done in a morphine-induced haze. Three members of the four-man crew desperately need a shave, shower, and fumigation. The other guy is clean, too clean. (You'll have to suffer through it if you want to find out what that means.)The film spends a lot of time pointlessly recreating 1983. There's a sickening mixture of slapstick humor and heartless violence. I wasted my time watching this. I'll give it two stars out of respect for the cast, which I feel did its best with what was some very poor material."
1,High (Low) Life,"Total waste of time. Waited for the ending to somehow validate this moronic movie and only got further into that place where you say to yourself ""How did I sit through that whole piece of junk?"" I'd give it about a -3 if they had minus stars."
5,great classroom read,"My students year after year beg to hear this story. A few become frightened, but don't want to stop the book-ever! This book introduces mystery genre quite effectively with many suspenseful moments."
5,The Half A Moon Inn,"What 11 year old boy wouldn't want to stay home alone. I thought. Aaron has a difficult life because he is mute, and wouldn't want to be home alone.Aaron is scared to be left alone because he is mute, and it could be dangerous for him.I felt like if I was inside Aarons shoes because I felt sad for him when his mom didn't come back. When we read this book I thought it was a wonderful and sad novel because at the end Aaron found his mom.I recommend this novel to everyone that will like to enjoy Paul Fleischman's stories/novels.I think that people who likes sad novels would like Paul Fleischman's stories because of his feelings."
1,CHEAP PIECE OF S***,POOR POOR POORBROKE VERY SOON !GAVE IT AS GIFT TO OUR SONCHEAP ASS PIECE OF S***WANT OUR MONEY BACK !!!!!!!!!!!!
1,A Piece of Junk,"I was hoping my experience with this product would be the same as those customers who rated it a 4 or 5. Obviously, these people must be the lucky FEW. The light worked great when I received it...for two uses max. Now it is a piece of junk. Will charge all night, battery life shows green, unplug, turn on, and in 5 seconds its dead. Will then light only momentarily when you push the switch. Let's face it people, this product is junk."
4,Mechanic Approved,"This is a great light. Very bright, nicely made. My Husband is a mechanic, and this light works well even for those night time, driveway car repairs."
2,Doesn't last...,After just three short trips on our boat it began to shred. The whole corner is gone. It looked well built but didn't last.
5,Martini Flag,This flag is well made and looks fabulous on our Pontoon Boat- perfect for cocktail hour.. good seller product as described
4,perfect for our sailing trip.....,"this was a perfect size and quality to put up on the sailboat for a week in the caribbean.at the end of the week the top corner was frayed, and it smelled like rum and salt air.nice quality overall, it is worth the price it cost."
2,'Blah' is the word you're looking for,"Eh. A bit disjointed, uneven - not every story is good, no story is great. This being my first foray back into crime writing since renouncing the genre after a bad meeting with an account of the Bernardo murders (I believe they were known as the Ken and Barbie killers in the Yoo Ess of Aye), I swore I wouldn't bother again.But this collection seemed sedate enough, with credits from such magazines as GQ, Harper's and Vanity Fair. The pieces collected are well-written for the most part, but vary from being only mildly interesting to boringly lurid.I'm looking forward to my next read."
5,Australian Adventure,"Back in Holland while I was a young girl in Highschool, my sister took me to see Bush Christmas. This story is so believable and the characters are real. These children are not going to let some bush rangers steal their favourite horse and spoil Christmas. Christmas in Australia is a wonderful time, it's about being free and relaxed. That's what this story is all about. The typical Australian courage to tackle anything, anywhere. Even the English boy Michael loves to be part of this adventure. Australia is adventure and the bush even more so. Watch this movie and enjoy the Australian way of celebrating and taking charge."
5,A Great Movie,I just loved watching the movie. The quality was excellent I grew up with Bush Christmas and as a teacher I used to always read the story to children. Who also loved it.I understand there has been a more recent version filmed. Is this available through Amazon.com ?
1,We fly away: A widowed Father's Struggle to Keep his Family,"After reading, ""We fly Away"", I truly wish that Ms. Garrett would take this book, the broom she flew in on and fly away herself!."
4,We Fly Away,"I think this book is a good story about a father who struggles to keep his family togetheer after his wife dies. I't is about family, love, and life. It will make you laugh and cry."
5,Beating The Odds,"A true depiction of how a fathers love and determination overcame the odds against both he and his family. In today's society, love, family, struggles and just plain hard work seem to be obsolete. We are a throw away society. Isn't it wonderful to see how a ""real"" family overcame obstacles, loss and managed to keep the love and not become a ""throw-away"" family. Three cheers for Dr. Alice Garrett and her siblings for continuing the traditions engrained by their father."
1,The attached straw device is useless,"The only reason I bought this item was b/c i thought this would prevent me from loosing the straw...well, the straw didn't line up with the nozzle properly so it won't spray out of the straw and it started foaming around the nozzle. I had to take it apart and reinstall it but to no avail. I recommend buying the one with the detached straw."
1,Stick with the original,"The smart straw mechanism broke the first time I tried to use it. If I press the button now, it just spews WD-40 uncontrollably.Stick with the original WD-40 if you need WD-40. And if you're worried about losing the straw, buy some tape."
1,Go back to the old sprayer,"I like WD-40. I know it works, but I wouldn't from this new can. Nothing comes out from the sprayer or the straw. Thumbs down!"
4,Great Lubricant - Recommended,"We use a lot of WD-40 in our house and small business. This spray lubricant has so many uses, from oiling our kid's bike chains to fixing squeaky hinges, it is amazing how many things we find to use it on.Some reviewers have reported issues with the attached straw, but it worked perfectly for me.This is a great product, made even better by the clever spray control ""Smart Straw""!Recommended!CFH"
4,Pure Delta!,"Well, I love Frank Frost. His Delta sound drive me nuts! The first recordings are perhaps the best ones, but Harpin' On It is great too. Pretty Baby and Pocket Full Of Money are some of my favourite numbers, and I love that lazy, swampy version of Got My mojo Working, far away from Muddy Waters' hard Chicago sound. Frank Frost has something magic that takes you to the hot summer nights of the Delta, in smoky, hot juke joints. His sound is covered with rust and mud; the blues seems to go out of his voice and harp like his breath. It looks like something he was born with, not something he picked up.I love Frank!"
1,I should have paid more attention to the other review.,The sound quality was not very good. Several of the songs would have what sounded like old Bing Crosby songs break into the Tams songs intermittently. I ended up cutting my loss and deleting the file.
1,pop psychology mush,"I got this book hoping it would be helpful. It was very heavy on the side of psychology, which is of very little help in parenting or life. If a reader feels the field of psychology is worth while, they will probably find this book to be of use. While there were some good points they were few and far between. While readers of books can eat the meat and spit out the bones, this was something like trying to eat tilapia."
2,Too snug fit,"In general I would say it's a nice carrier with nice colors, the reason it gets a 2 star rating. The problem I had that the fit was too snug for my little one. Every time I put her in the carrier she would get claustrophobic and start crying to get out. My baby's legs started to get purple because the leg openings where too small for her legs. She is now 3 months and the carrier is too tight/snug for her. I would recommend a carrier with adjustable leg openings, especially if your baby baby doesn't have skinny legs. If you have a tiny baby you can go ahead but they will outgrow it very fast. My baby was 5 lbs at birth and by 3 months I had to put the carrier away."
2,pretty bad,"Luckily I did not purchase this book - I only checked it out from the library. The story is about a group of children who try to figure out what kind of bug layed the golden eggs. They think they find out, then they are wrong again and again. This book is too wordy for a new reader. My daughter, 7 did not enjoy reading this book at all."
1,Definitely NOT 12 feet,"Though this claims to be a 12 foot coil, apparently that means if you were to completely stretch out the coil, which you can't really do. It realistically stretches to about 2 feet before it pulls the phone off the wall. Not nearly long enough for my purposes. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Watch Out!,"I thought that I was adding this 29 cent cord to my Amazon order only to find three minutes later via email confirmation that in fact I was to pay $6.98 for this item. I IMMEDIATELY contacted the company and was told via an immediate email that said ""TOO LATE"" and was looped to a link that did not exist.I've learned a pricey lesson. I would not, and will not, use this company for anything if you have no corrective action within minutes of placing an order.I am very disappointed with Amazon as well. This smells of a scam...$6.98 for a 29 cent item...utterly and shamefully wrong."
2,Check and see if this is necessary,"I ordered a super cool phone and this was suggested as something to go with it. I immediately added it to the order. However, my super cool phone has its cord permanently attached so this could not be used.Then, I got charged for the return shipping.Be sure you need/can use this before you add it to your order."
1,GE? P.O.C.,"Just cause it says GE doesn't make this a quality product. Didn't work out of the box.Compared to the cord that came with the phone, this one is a POC."
1,No!!!,"If no stars were an option, that's what I would've selected. Extremely poor quality. Stay away."
2,Don't buy to use with Crosley 302 Wall Phone,"The Crosley 302 Wall PhoneCrosley 302 Wall Phone CR55-Blackdoesn't allow replacement of the handset cord. So, save yourself the money and don't buy this cord (or any other) to go with that phone."
5,This Listing is an Amazon Error,"This is an inadvertent error by Amazon. The book has never been out of print. The book is listed correctly at the top of the list of books for Robert David Steele, and a currently available copy is at the link below:The New Craft of Intelligence: Personal, Public, & Political--Citizen's Action Handbook for Fighting Terrorism, Genocide, Disease, Toxic Bombs, & Corruption"
4,Works fine,"Works fine in my Dell Optiplex GX260. Video card did not come with a fan as depicted in the picture. Did not need to order the low profile bracket kit as suggested by amazon.com. Low profile brackets were already provided. Card also came with a DVI to VGA adapter, so can use that instead of the card's VGA extension."
5,Great card for older systems,"This card works great in my old HP Compaq D530 SFF machine. Easy installation, low profile hardware IS included. Works great in Ubuntu 8.10."
2,My money gone with the wind,"This book has a neat cover and a tie-in to a classic book I have loved forever. Turner Publications cranked it out and apparently does this for a lot of the classic movies it owns. How sad. It's very slim with a few recipes that are admittedly southern and pages of blank space. So I can write my own cookbook? I would send it back, but it's not worth the postage. Wish I had read the reviews before I bought. Don't waste your money."
1,Dust collector...,"This book is great for a memorabilia piece, but the recipes are horrible. Not a good cookbook for your everyday collection. If you are looking for good southern food, look for another cookbook. This is mainly a collectible."
5,Perfect,"Arrived in record time..I am having a ""Gone With the Wind"" Christmas....I love looking at the recipes....so hard to choose which one...but this book puts me in the old south mood"
1,del Espiritu de las Leyes (Grandes Maestros del Derecho),I can't rate this product because I never received it. It is the worst on-line ordering experience of my life!!!!
2,Zebrahead used to be good before this,"MFZB and Playmate are two of my favorite cd's out there and this one sure makes the band sound like crap. The new singer just isnt as good as the previous one. He makes the band sound like another pop band like Good Charlotte that is targeting the audience of teenage girls. A few songs are good, but overall the CD is crap and I cant bring myself to listen to it as much as previous Zebrahead cd's. It doesnt have the same energy as previous albums."
2,downhill battle,"I started noticing a change in ZH back when playmate of the year came out. with mfzb, my fears had come true; zh was a different band. If you like pop-punk, you'll like this cd. if you're more into rap/reggage and punk hybrids, you probably won't. RIP zebrahead."
2,Both Good And Bad,"These pins are SMALL. Yes, they're one inch and if the entire thing would have cost a dollar, it would have been worth it. With the shipping and everything else, six bucks is far too much to pay for these, even with the great quality they are."
1,Not his best work.,"Tim Hart has produced over the years some brilliant work with Maddy Prior and Steeleye Span. But this solo attempt does him very little credit. Tim I am sorry to say is not a song writer and this showed on this CD. Its worth buying for all the die hard Steeleye Span fans to complete their collection, but for anybody else the weak lyrics and less than perfect music do little to retain Tim Hart's brilliant reputation."
1,dangerous sharp edge on buckle,this is a beautiful collar..but the buckle..rather the thingy that goes through the holes has a terribly sharp metal jegged point which cut me and would have cut into the dogs..not far but enough to make them very uncomfortable. i did solve this by putting some cotton then wrapping waterproof first aid soft tape around it so once you put it thru the hole its not noticable...these collars should not be sold though..they are defective and i hate the thought dogs may wear these unless modified to remove that sharp jagged peice sticking out into the neck/
2,gift,they never use it. now I can say this was large and uncomfortable to use. I wouldn't recommend it..and the music skips.
2,Not Ultralink's best effort,"Ultralink makes some very nice banana plugs - but these are not among them.Pros:1. The leaf spring design makes a very secure connection with the speaker terminal.Problems:1. The cavity where you insert the speaker wire is a tube of solid copper. It is very difficult to crimp this to get a secure connection.2. The soft rubber cover is held on by a very weak friction fit. This does not provide any stress relief. Given the good grip on the terminal and the weak fit on the wire, you end up either pulling the rubber cover off or pulling the wire out of the connector before it lets go of the speaker terminal.Look for plugs with a more secure wire connection system, stress relief system - or both."
2,Girls would find it difficult find something they didn't already know,"Weak,Boring,Typical generalizing scam.You want real information that would save you and your car from the shop scamers.This rag was writen by the those rats.Brings the old quote to mind...""We know only as much as you do"".Truly hard to read."
2,"Too general, not helpful","This book would be better if it were more specific to the model and year. It covers the Town Car and Continental, which are two completely different cars, and also covers too broad a time period for any information on the book to be useful."
4,The Last Contract--Suspenseful and well-plotted!,"This is an absorbing drama based on the assassination of Olof Palme, and has divergent stories: the killer himself, and the one investigator in particular trying to solve it, and having difficulties thrown in his way.Michael Kitchen is superb and Mikael Persbrandt is a marvel in this. The ending was a complete surprise!"
5,wonderful!,"Smooth, absorbes easily wonderful scent! It is true to the perfume, my favorite scent, I have several different Ombre Rose products, I love it!"
5,Light-Hearted Goodness,"This CD is wonderful. The songs on it are fresh, fun, sweet and light. It is not heavy and it is not a 'thinker's' kind of CD, which is why I am drawn to Darius' music. I normally listen to alternative and new rock music but a little bit of pop can be good for the soul and, in the end, Darius' songs leave me feeling content."
5,Magic!,"I bought the handle, the Mystic Mop replacement pad and the Cloud Duster as a set. The Mystic Mop is pretty close to being magical in the way it cleans my floors - hardwood and tile. Since I have two, I can get my floors very clean and then wash them when I wash my white clothes. It's so easy!"
1,Oversold!,"It is a cloth that picks up dirt, but is it special? NO! Gets dirty quickly and misses a lot of dirt and pet hair. Not the magic picker - upper other users describe. Not worth the money. Went back to my regular broom, which I don't need to wash."
3,Big disappointment after Laura's other books,Rarely have I encountered two more miserable characters as the hero and heroine as in this book. If you are into angst ridden readings then this is the book for you. I really enjoyed Baker's two prior books very much but this one I just gave up on less than a third through. Go get Stargazer or Legend and forget this one.
4,I LUV THIS BOOK!!!,"This series is one of my most treasured, as it renewed my long cherished dream of having my own pony. In this book the last of the trilogy, Swallow, Rowan's pony is chosen to play a lead role in a film, but Hugh, not Rowan, is chosen to ride him...Swallow is in the news, and because of Swallows background, some heart breaking choices must be made...I can really relate to Rowan, the lead character, as my favourite pony is also a bit of a handful, and i hate to see other people ride him."
3,It's not bad.....,"This is by no means Kottke at his best, but BALANCE does have it's moments. Kottke fans will want to have it. As for new comers, I don't strongly recommend this one."
5,very satisfied,I bought this used for under $5.00!!! it is in great condition!! i will definitely purchase again in the future from this company.
3,Not the best Nick Jr mix,"My preschool son absolutely adores all the Nick Jr mixed DVDs (such as the Animal one, Sports one, and Family one), however he seems to have no interest in this particular one. Personally, I find it to be the most boring of all of them. My advice, don't waste your money on this one. There's a large collection of others that keep a child's attention far more."
4,entertaining,keeps my great-grandsons attention. He enjoys watching his favorites over and over again. The one he likes the most is Little Bill
2,A Limp Finish,"Any Trouble finally caught a break with a major label after Stiff gave them the heave-ho when the album ""Wheels In Motion"" fell flat. So did Clive Gregson and company take advantage of the deal with EMI to use and ace producer and polish up their sound so it would find an ear in America?Nope...they put away the guitars and tried to become Howard Jones. ""Wrong End Of The Race"" finds the band attempting to stretch out, going as far as re-recording a few of their strongest songs from the first two lp's with more of the moment arrangements. That mistake robbed the songs of their charm, and the album failed to win over the cult that had built around their two Stiff albums or win Any Trouble any converts.Do yourself a favor. Get the CD of ""Where Are All The Nice Girls"" or the ""Best of The Stiff Years"" collection instead."
3,voices carry,"The opening track, ""Open Fire,"" is one of the best songs that Any Trouble ever recorded. Heck, it's one of the best songs that ANY band recorded in the 80s. Really, a great song. The rest of the album suffers in both quality and consistency. There are some very good songs on here, but the arrangements are sometimes overblown or just plain annoying. Whose idea was it to put reggae arrangments on some tunes? Awful. But the fact that Clive Gregson has such a wonderfully soothing voice (think: a mellower, more tuneful Elvis Costello), makes up for some of the weaker material. If you liked ""Where are all the Nice Girls"" by Any Trouble, you may be disappointed by most of this album. But then again, some of the highlights on here are very, very good, and Gregson's vocals act to elevate everything."
2,Not a good read,"I wasn't thrilled with any of the books I recently purchased. Seems they are cheap because they are discontinued and they are discontinued because they are bad. Don't know this for sure, but it seems likely."
4,Good inspirational listening,"If you like Seal's music, this is a definite ""must have."" I purchased it, because I didn't want all of his individual albums, yet wanted to be able to listen to his greatest hits and follow along. It's one of those CDs you pop in the car when you've had a stressful day, and after listening to a few songs, you are reenergized, revitalized, and uplifted."
5,Absolutely fabulous!!!,"Being a big Seal fan, I'd buy any Seal release anyway, but this one is just awesome...You get Seal's biggest hits on the first CD, all re-mastered, and like that's not enough, you get a delightful Acoustic feast in the second cd...These acoustic versions have never been released, and they are just unreal...don't even think twice about buying this 2CD album..."
2,I like Seal's music but............,"for me a better compilation would have been to take his entire second CD, two hits from each of his first, third and fourth CD's. After listening to this CD I found it to sound too corporate and rather dull and uninspiring. If you like Seal's ""Hits"" you might want to check out SEAL II. That's the only Seal CD I have in my collection, although I used to have SEAL III. I heard that the 2-CD Hits (gold packaging with the acoustic songs) is the one to purchase."
5,Great CD,"Excellent CD and well worth the money. After I purchased this CD I took my husband to see him in concert. You just can't go wrong with his music, it's for everyone."
2,Boring except for the fight,"I had never seen this before but I was on a spending spree on amazon and am generally a fan of reality tv, so as this was cheap I thought I'd give it a go. Having read some of the reviews I knew there was a big fight at some stage in the series. The first episode was alright, but after that it gets pretty boring and predictable.Then comes the big fight. It is good tv, with one housemate suddenly going off on another out of nowhere. I watched the next episode but it gets pretty boring pretty quickly. I didn't even finish watching it to the end of the season. Maybe when I'm sitting around on a rainy day and I have absolutely nothing else to do I might watch the rest..... but I doubt it. Thankfully I only paid $10 for it so not a big loss, but I won't be buying any more college hill dvds."
3,I expected more extras....,"This college hill was an okay one because of the merging of the VI and California students. That alone was enough drama. However, I expected more interresting bonus features. If I knew that it was going to be just like what I saw on BET, I would not have waisted my money on it. Plus, this season didn't give you the feel of being back in college like the Virginia College Hill did."
2,Works... sort of,"Pro'sWorks on some 66M blocksCon'sDidn't work on my Leviton 66 blockOther ThoughtsI bought this to work on my Leviton 66 block. It appears that Leviton has made different 66 blocks over the years because it did not work. My Leviton 66M Block marked as S66M1-50. However, it worked beautifully with the no-name block that I had lying around. Unfortunately, I bought 3 of these. I really only needed 2 to work. I was only able to use 1. The mounting style should be more clearly noted on this item. More pictures would help as well."
2,Not for me.,"Bought this one based on high ratings but was disappointed. It was a chore to keep reading and finish. I love this genre but rarely have disliked a book this much. Two stars because I really didn't like it, not ""hated it""."
2,I wouldn't recommend it.,"This book was disappointing. I felt like I had read it before, either I have or it was just that unsurprising. It was a petty little story line and I disliked all of the characters. I was not impressed by the ending, nor did I feel like there was a point to the book. A great idea that could have been executed in a more interesting manner."
3,Great watch but too small.,"Bought this watch for my girl friend, when i got it i could not believe that it was so small.This watch would have been a classic if it wasn't so small, i think that the size have taken away the appeal value of the watch."
4,Bell Xray helmet review,Compared to my Schwin helmet I find the inside padding to be very hard.Otherwise I find it is a very attractive helmet.
5,A whimsical tale of a cat,"This edition combines three Zoom fantasy stories under one cover: Zoom Away, Zoom At Sea, Zoom Upstream. The seagoing cat enjoys black and white drawings by Eric Beddows and a story line which requires some reading skills or parental assistance, but which provides a whimsical tale of a cat in search of a mysterious vagabond uncle, inviting all to enjoy."
1,Not worth it at all,It worked twice then it would not charge anymore . The thing that moves the wheel feel off on it . I put it back on it but it was only good for a little a while. It feel off again . I took off the mouse part which is just sitting on top . It has 4 screws on it . The connection between remote and it is about 5 feet. It is like you have a invisible wire to it . Don't buy it
2,NOT WHAT I ORDERD,I bought a SmartyKat RunawayRascal Remote-Controlled Mouse Cat Toy but the one that is posted now is not the one that was posted when I placed my oder. the one i odered had a bigger mouse with a cat nip pocket an a remote controll that looked like a cheese block my cat did not take to the one thats posted now. I had the cheeblock one befor an my cat loved it so so much she slept with it. I'm very diapointed
3,Expected more,"Kind of disapointed with this DVD. It is for beginner/intermediate levels, I was expecting something more challenging.Though it is nice to see and follow the outdoors practice, production could be more careful with the views, cleanse the camera'a lense, etc.The sequence is very repetitive (eg. the warrior sequence at the beginning) and the instructor is never steady at the poses, she's always moving giving the impression that she cant stabilize herself.... I've seen better and more professional DVDs. I also got Vinyasa Flow by Maral Hadidi, muchhh better and a lot more challenging and professional!"
4,Strong video but a few minor flaws,"I really enjoyed this DVD. It has a nice slow flow to it and does allow you time to adjust to a pose or work your way into a fairly difficult pose. I think this is a solid intermediate level DVD, there are some challenging poses in the way of back bends and balance poses, but for the most part the DVD is doable. My problems with this DVD was the occasional lighting where all you could see would be shadows (but I think that was to highlight the ocean scenery) and another sequence would have been good as well (either a shorter one of maybe 30-40 minutes or a longer one of 90 minutes or so). Otherwise, this is a nice DVD, the instructor was really good, and look forward to more of her DVDs. Overall this is DVD is more like 4.5 stars."
3,Pretty good...,"The content is pretty good but the picture quality can be pretty bad at times. A lot of the shots are dark, so you can't really see what they are doing. You see shadows of the people and a beautiful background of the beach."
5,Calming,"This video has inspired me to practice yoga nearly every day. The setting is absolutely breathtaking, and the music very relaxing and perfect for the poses. Christinas voice is very calming and enjoyable to listen to.The flow is great for all levels of yogi, and a wonderful addition to your morning routine!Enjoy, I high recommend it!"
3,Fugue,Well played and interesting music although there is nothing remarkably different between the fugues. It's a disc for playing one track then reach for something else.
1,Nothing but a shallow xerox job,"The problem with this book is it swallowed whole what had already been reported in the press without the author doing any analysis or insight. Stone didn't delve into the depths. He just skimmed the surface. The author simply bought everything the Washington Post said, swallowed whatever Senator John Sidney McCain claimed, and believed the verdict imposed by the Justice Department, because the matter never went to trial. He had no access to Abramoff and no access to 99% of the documentary evidence that McCain refused to release. In a word, this author didn't scratch below the surface. He just basically photocopied what the press had already reported. This book is a complete waste of time."
1,NEO-CONMAN,"This book didnt go far enough of this neo-conman's connection to Dubja ""00's"" decade of greed; similar to the gopper ""80's"" greed. I wonder if the government will take back Casino Jack money he stole from the Indians and return it? or will the government let Casino Jack keep the Indian's money when they get out of Club-Fed, like Michael Milken and Ivan Bolsky."
2,Burn out very frequently,"Two Stars lfrom me like the rest of the gang. While the light emitted is nice on the eyes and brightens up the room, these bulbs burn out very frequently. I'm lucky to get a few months per bulb."
2,Bases don't fit sockets,"The bases on several sizes of the GE Reveal bulbs do not fit sockets well and the bulbs either do not make good contact or the bulbs separate from the base if you apply too much force. Very poor quality control on all sizes that I have used. Like the light, hate the mechanics. Not recommended."
5,Bright white daylight bulb,I like this product. Always look for this brand due to the crisp white daylight lighting. Great product. Good price and speedy delivery.
2,Not made like they used to be..,"Our Barber Shop had three old metal lather machines but decided to upgrade... what a mistake. We bought three new Lather Kings. We've tried everything to keep these things running in our Barber Shop. Distilled water, tap water, cleaner, no cleaner... nothing seems to be any better than the other. We have finally found one thing that has been working the last few weeks, we use a full capfull of recommended soap, and very hot water. We need to refill 2x a day, but so far so good. Also, All three of these new machines have cracked plastic (top and sides) after the first year of use. We are not impressed with this machine."
4,Good CD,"This is the first CD I ever owned and I have always liked it. I can't speak for others because it'll really depend on your taste in music, sort of college-girl-writing-my-own-stuff-now is the impression I get. But I like it, original and interesting."
3,Desert Island 5,Michael Schenker at his best. This CD is mixed perfectly with pounding drums of the late great Cozy Powell. Michael's leads are flawless. The song arangement flows perfecly leading towards a chill raising version of Lost Horizons. This CD is on my Desert Island 5.
2,So-so,"This was recorded shortly before the release of Schenker's second solo album. That points up the two things wrong with this: the band sounds tentative, like they're not comfortable with the new material, and the setlist is drawn almost entirely from those first two albums. That leads to some questionable choices: it opens with the big, inspiring ""Ride of the Valkyries"" music (uh, that's ""Kill the Wabbit"", if you don't recognize the name), and then the band comes in with a big, exciting, crashing chord, and you're just dying to hear them tear into ""Captain Nemo"", and it's an extreme letdown to hear ""Armed and Ready"" instead. Another odd choice is the piano ballad ""Never Trust a Stranger"", which surprisingly works very well live, and fits in well with the rest of the tunes because everything is played s-l-o-w. On the other hand, Schenker himself is great, so how bad can it be? And there are a couple of songs here which you won't hear in live versions anywhere else."
2,A compilation....,"Make a mix of Michael's first two solo albums (Michael Schenker Group and MSG), add UFO's ""Doctor Doctor"" and that's the set list for this live album recorded in Japan. So, the utility of this album is in accord with your preference for live albums or not, because, if you already own hhis first two albums, this album is utterly superfluous. At least the line up is the same of MSG: Barden, Michael, Glen, Raymond and POwell, and they deliver with their customary high skills and professionalism."
4,phone cord,"The cord arrived safely, is very useful and efficient. Not quite sure why it is called a Verizon cord since it was made by GE. Anyway I will keep this cord and possibly buy another since I don't have a wireless phone and need a long cord.Linda Sheean"
3,Substandard quality,"Well it works is about all.So far it is a tangled mess, and the plastic sheath is coming off the wire at the connection at the phone.This is the worst code we have every had, and we have had many over the years.I will go for another brand soon."
5,Arrive on time,"This is a basic phone cord, but the price beat lcoal vendors and was shipped directly to my house. Great"
2,Vendor sent GE cord instead,"Although I order the pictured Verizon branded cord, I received a GE branded and packaged cord. The cord works fine but it is not of high quality; just the typical low-quality cord that you would find at a big-box store. It works but I was hoping for a higher quality feel. I wonder what the Verizon cord would have been like?"
4,Don't look for LOA here...,"Let's get this out of the way. If you are a LOA fan and you think this album will satisfy your need for another LOA release, don't buy. HOWEVER, if you like Keith Caputo's voice and have and open mind with music and like other genres than metal, BUY THIS ALBUM!!! I had no idea what to expect with this release. I was so pleasantly surprised when I finished listening to it. Keith has a soft voice here and it helped him reinvent himself with Died Laughing. There aren't any hardcore riffs here. The songs are a bit poppy in nature. His lyrics seem to mean something when you listen as well."
5,Keith is one of the best,"this album is on of the best i have heard, i saw him at roskilde festival and he rocked, played most of this songs and on of LOA, and his voice is amazing, hes one of the best along Chris Cornell and Sebastian Bach, a must buy!"
2,Just another SAT book,"The idea is defintly a new one but the book falls far short of expectations. The book does have some interesting images, but the stories that are told sometimes become too hard to remember and too tedious. At times it feels as though you are reading a dictionary, and sometimes the idea will click in your head. Overall 2 stars for this book is the most it really deserves."
2,Avid Vocabulary Expander,"Since no one else seemed to mention this in there review, I decided to put it in mine: DON'T BE FOOLED WITH FUNNY PICTURES SCAM. Granted there are some pictures, but with most of the words there is just a paragraph describing a picture. I found this to be very disappointing, and I warn anyone interested to purchase with caution"
2,Lacks a Body,"Hilarious, enjoyable introduction; really got me hyped up to learn the words that were to follow. Okay, so when I hit the words my mind goes blank. Why? I see, well, common words, heck, EASY words. Words you're already supposed to know. I flip through the book hoping it would advance, but no, it was consistant, simple words. Words like ""mundane"" and ""supplement"". Uh huh. Sure, I didn't know what ""avarice"" was (used as an example in the excellent introduction), but, hey, the 500 words in this book are a joke!This isn't the most challenging book out there. Printed on great paper though!"
2,This book could kill you...,"When I got this book in preparation for my PSAT, I knew right away I had made a mistake. The concept behind this ""revolutionary"" book is to get you to associate words with a situation or mental picture the book provides for you. The problem is that one finds themselves taking one step too many in memorizing both the mental picture and then the definition. This takes way too much time (time you don't have an abundance of on the verbal section of the SAT). Another easy trap to fall into is to simply memorize the picture and forget what word it's associated with. Looking at some other reviews, I see this system is working just fine for some people (meriting its two-star rating). I just find it sad that so many people are willing to memorize information that will not help them in the long run. If you want to commit an act of mental suicide, pick up a copy."
5,THIS IS A VERY GOOD AND INFORMATIONAL BOOK,"If you are looking to improve you verbal scores this is it. It is very informational and interesting to read. I have read a lot of books, but this surpasses them all. ITS A SURE CHOICE!!!!"
2,"Good, but bad","A good selection of words and decent devices to make them slightly easier to remember, but few serious faults. Most of the visiual images are for relatively familiar words, defeating the purpose. And even worse, much of the writing is politically incorrect or even offensive. One word's image is an ""indian chief,"" to name one example. Overall, a good list of words, but not necessarily good content."
5,Amazing DVD-Audio !!,"I bought this package to try out the DVD-Audio version in our Acura ELS Surround Sound System and it was AMAZING. I was skeptical of the car dealer hype, but the sound quality was unbelievable compared to the CD version. The DVD-Audio version is a masterpiece."
1,Quality poor/Warranty not honored,"I purchased this item from Amazon with the thought it would be of decent quality since it was branded GE. The cord became unsightly and stretched out almost immediately. Later, it caused static. Attempted to return to the manufacturer, Jasco, per the instructions on the package. The package was returned as undeliverable, addressee moved. Contacted the comapany online and they asked for it to be resent as the address on the package was not valid. After considering the postage for a second mailing versus the cost of the item, I just threw it away. The customer service department could have made a better choice as now they have lost a customer."
1,Worthless,"I ordered this cord less than two weeks ago to replace one that had been on our key system for over 10 years. Initially, it was good, but in less than one week it was already out of shape and please know that it is not used for moving around - only to pick up and answer the phone while sitting at my desk. Today it is completely stretched out and I am having to order a different one. I am going to buy the one that is a few dollars more, hoping for far better results. To the point: this was one time that I got exactly what I paid for."
1,Problem,"This cord did not work, we could not speak. We returned this item, and decided to buy it local so we could easily return it if we had further problems. The local store cord worked fine. It also cost more."
1,"Dull, Dull, Dull","The same 4 steps are repeated throughout this video. I don't know how anyone could possibly exercise with it more than once. Technique is sloppy, it's outdated. Don't waste your money."
2,Very poor performance,"I am more demanding of a shave cream than most in that I shave my head as well as face. This was the worst shave cream I've ever used. It seems to offer about as much protection as plain water. I never had this many nicks and cuts with any other product. On the plus side, the ingredients are natural, nontoxic and it has a pleasant aroma. I actually threw this stuff in the trash. I'm currently using Aubrey Organics shave cream and it works much better for me."
3,interesting cream,"I like to try different creams since I started safety razor shaving and using a brush to lather up a soap.The scent is as described and the main reason I bought it.The tingle or stinging feeling is the strongest of any creams that I have tried. Not painful but surprising.I'm used to lathering up creams and soaps but I can't with this, I just have to put some on my face by hand.I won't buy this again, I'm going to stick with soaps and creams that lather up."
2,Not what I thought,"I couldn't finish it! Too slow and the main character was dull, depressing and rude. The stryline was alittle confusing as chapters jumped back and forth between times and characters. I loved the premise of the story, but would have enjoyed it from a more historical view rather than from the present day -just my own personal preference."
2,Plodding and disappointing,"I rather liked the historical details and information about jewels that were worked into the story, but like other reviewers I found the characters cold, distant and not compelling. Katherine, the protagonist, suffers from the malady that ruins so many novels nowadays -- she's a self-involved narcissist whose obsessions are meaningless. The only remotely likable character is Daniel, and he suffers from another common character malady: he does little except question why he does so little. The quest is a snore, although there are a few highlights along the way; the ""insights"" and requisite quirky characters held little meaning for me."
2,Hardly thrilling...,"I have to admit I did not finish this book. I slugged through the first three-quarters over about three weeks then skipped ahead to the last page, decided it wasn't worth the effort and put it away. I'm sorry, but I wouldn't call this book ""riveting"" or ""thrilling"" (maybe I just gave up too soon). Like other reviewers I didn't find Katharine particularly likeable though that didn't bother me much. She just wasn't all that interesting. The brothers, Daniel and Salman, were only a little more interesting. Actually the most interesting ""characters"" in the book were the stones themselves. Two stars for the stones."
2,Needs some lust,"The minute you think of ancient stones, history and chase...you (watching too much TV as a youngen) expect ...well some lust, a lascivious love story interplaying all these chases.Nope- nothing. Maybe that's why Katherine came across as a bitter middle-aged woman."
2,Underwhelming,"Like many programming authors with not much to say, Knudsen pads his book with entire programs. Better books elide out all but the relevant fragments, but poor books include the whole program to flesh out their page count. This is really a 100-page book in disguise.To give you an idea of what level the author is targetting, on page 155 he helpfully explains, ""You are probably familiar with the try-catch blocks... The finally clause is not as well known, but it is very useful.""If you already know what a finally clause is, you probably won't be well-served by this book. If you don't, then please buy my copy: I won't be needing it."
3,Sample code does not work,Having read only the first few chapters I was ready to go run the first example. The problem was the server that the Jargoneer application connects to does not exist at the URL used. Not a very impressive start! Hopefully the other examples work.
1,Daft,"This book is really, really daft, because to date there is only a minute number of mobile phones available on the planet which implement MIDP 2.0. You can't imagine how painful that is, because chances are you won't be able to run Knudsen's code on your device. Not only that, you won't even be able to compile it with your version 1 tools. It's a shame really, it's otherwise a good intro to J2ME with plenty of code and an appendix which serves as a reference. Pity that we'll all have to wait at least for another year to use this book while the mobile device manufacturers get up to speed. I for one am a bitterly disappointed programmer, I can tell you that, and wish I hadn't spend my last bucks on this book."
4,Better than the first!,"If you thought the first one was a little played out and fake, and overall just plain weird....This movie seems to end the disappointment. I was very eager to see what happened next in every scene, it just kept me entertained. The fight with Uma Thurman and Daryl Hannah was completely amazing and entertaining. You have to see this movie, even if you didn't like the first, you have to see the second still."
3,"Not as good as Volume 1, but it was okay.","I saw this movie with my parents on video. I was anxious to find out what would happen. I was dissapointed when there wasn't any violence like volome one. There was one part when the bride fought one of the people one her list called Elle. Now that was the only good part! I don't know why she was nice to Bill at all near the ending. Anyway, it was good."
3,Great product,This movie is not as good as the first but the quality of the dvd that I received was great.
5,Ignore Those Who Don't Get It,Just saw this movie last night and it was terrific. The dialogue is very good and the people who didn't like it just want to rot their brains on some stupid action movie. Go see whatever Crap the Rock or Vin Diesel make then and stay away from Vol Two which is just GREAT.
5,"Sit back, loosen up, and enjoy the ride.","The Bride got herself some bloody satisfaction in ""Kill Bill, vol. 1"", and she got a whole lot more in ""Kill Bill, vol. 2"". And, after seeing both films -- the first on DVD and the second about 2 hours ago at the cinema -- I'm pretty bloody satisfied myself.Is it violent? Yes.Is it over the top? Yes.Is it approriate for children? Probably not.Is it a good film? Hell yes!(...)First off, any kid that can handle seeing Bambi's mother get shot by hunters in the Disney cartoon can handle the violence in ""Kill Bill"" if they've got a set of sensible parents.Second, Tarantino is sending a message about a parent's responsibility to her children. The Bride didn't walk out on Bill on a whim; the fact that she was pregnant and wanted to raise her child in peace drove her to leave and set in motion the events depicted in the film.If all you see is mindless ultraviolence, get your eyes checked."
3,Substandard,"While I gave volume 1 a 4-star, this only gets a 3-star rating. Substandard for this director. Okay, it may be better than other directors, but if I am watching a movie largely based on the director, I don't want to be disappointed. Basically, if you happened on volume 1, you should watch volume 2. Otherwise, keep moving."
2,"vol1 fairly good, vol2 terrible","kill bill 1- 3 of 5 starskill bill 2- 1/2 star out of fiveoverrated movie, overrated director (tarantino- thief who stole city on fire and called it reservoir dogs)"
1,Bad.,"I liked the first Kill Bill, but this one went nowere and was so stuip. Infact I was laughing the intire time. The worst part is were Uma Thurman is tied up and buried 5 miles under ground. So how she is able to get her feet untided, get a knife, untie her arms, punch her way out of the cofin she was in, and just climb up the 5 miles of dirt. This was the first summer film I have seen and it was bad. I hope Van Helsing, Alien vs. Predator, and Resident Evil 2 are better."
1,kill bill 2,"never got item....the seller never had a way to track item...very bad idea.Then customer wouldn't replace item, just refund"
5,As the more killing comes the better Tarentino's story gets,"Not much to say it's a Tarentino flick, you just can't get any better. This one is supposed to be more brutal, than the ass wippons that Uma gave in Vol. 1. In Vol. 2 you will see more of Uma dramaticaly. Now from the recent preview's it will be 10 times better than Vol. 1 and i know it will be. So be sure to see Uma return as the Bride in Kill Bill Vol. 2."
2,What a disappointment....,"I was reluctant to see even the first volume because I had heard so much about the violence but ended up LOVING it (the violence was so stylized and over-the-top you couldn't take it seriously anyways!). Snappy plot, clever dialogue and great visuals, what more do you need from a good movie? That is why I was so eager to see the second one in theaters.Boy, was I disappointed. Halfway through I couldn't believe I still had to sit there another hour through this pointless and meandering drivel. After almost every scene you found yourself thinking, ""What did that have to do with anything?"" other than, of course, to give QT a mouthpiece on his particular views (the Superman speech for example). Vol 1 and 2 should have been one, 3 hour, awesome movie with the right mix of dialogue and action. Split into two you ended up with one almost pure action and one almost pure boredom. What a pity!"
1,2 movies to make 1 ?,I don't like how they made 2 movies instead of 1. I refuse to put any money out either to rent or own Kill Bill #2. I hope that movie producers do not follow this idea ever again...... It is a money grabbin technique for something that is really not that worth it......
5,KILL BILL -VOL 2 PSS,ITEM JUST AS DESCRIBED ! FAST AND FRIENDLY ! A REAL PLEASURE DOIN BUSINESS WITH ... THANK YOU !
3,She is gonna Kill Bill,"...and you should get it just to wrap up the story, though it is true this is the weaker of the two movies. As a film ignoramus, I was not equipped to figure out just what films Tarantino is flashing to, but I could tell that he was doing just that consistently throughout this movie(I think I caught one particular Shaw Bros reference, but I can't remember the name of the flick for the life of me). Anyway, be prepared for a considerably lower body count than Vol.1-The Bride basically finishes off her list after being shot with rock salt, buried alive, and drugged. Watching her put down the miscast Daryl Hannah(she can't do mean) is definitely eye candy. That was a very bad pun, by the way, as you will find out should you see this. And you should."
5,Oh my god!! Even better than the first!!,"I thought nothing would have been as good as Volume 1. I should have know better with Quentin Tarantino! This film is even better than the first! In this film, we see Bill (David Caradine) for the first time and realize the reasons for the carnage that ""The Bride"" (Uma Thurman) has endured. We also see the final two individuals who took part in the onslaught (Daryl Hannah, Michael Madsen). All of the characters are explained very deeply and we know their motives. Throw in the incredible editing and visual imagery and you have one great film that will be remembered for a long time."
2,"nah...really a ""B- sides"" movie","people say this is supposed to be much more emotional but I find that the plot is actually much weaker than in the first one.I liked Bill as a character but something was inconsistent about him, it wasn' t the ""Bill"" in the first movie.Also, I think the buried alive scene is not credible.There are too many scenes which waste time. I hated Kill Bill 1 because of its lack of depth and sadistic violence but believe it or not, the best part is the gory fight between Elle and the Bride.And where is Tarantino's ""dialogue""? Really, not much interesting dialogue at all.Overall, maybe worth it if you adored Kill Bill 1 but absolutely pointless otherwise."
2,Very low body count and lots of yakity-yak-yak....,"The first film was pretty good, despite the fact that it stars two of the dark horses of the Apocolypse: Lucy Lu and Uma Thurman. This film has 1 (ONE) decent fight scene in it and lots of supposedly ""intense"" dialog.David Carradine and his phony martial arts pedigree shows up in the middle and at the end of this endurance test of a film to talk......and talk and talk and talk. In fact, the entire film is a blab-fest.I'm glad that I did'nt pay serious movie $$ to go see Part 2; Kill Bill should have been one long, good film instead of 1 good film and one bad one."
2,Who dropped the ball?,"Kill Bill Vol 1, was one best films I had seen in a long time. The film was an energetic experimental collage that pushed the boudries of storytelling in cinema. Vol 2. is just boring, it's like Jackie Brown, a radio show with a follow along picture book.The Kill Bill story is very simple, The opening scene of Vol.1 allowed the rest of the film to flow visually and conceptually without rules, it assumes that you have already seen 3 more movies about revenge, so it doesn't spend too much time dwelling on a story that you heard before.Vol 2.focuses on characters who yap about the obvious. The only interesting revelation in this movie is Bill's motive for doing what he did, other than that 2 minute monologue, I was really disappointed."
1,Barely audible,"All the excitement of seeing this movie was down the drain. Disappointingly poor sound quality. Maybe it would be better playing on TV. If you are to watch it from a computer, I suggest a lip reading class first."
2,IF YOU LIKE ACTION YOU WILL.......HATE THIS FILM,"I seen vol.1 the day it came out in theaters and i loved it couldnt not wait for the second. finally the day came and i went to go see sadly i didnt care for it. the movie starts out very boring alot of scenes carry on for way to long and the 1 yes i said it 1 fight scene in the movie isnt that great and is not very long the part that made me give it 2 stars was the acting was great and the flashback to Umas training is sweet i liked that alot but other then that nothing happins and the last fight with bill isnt even a fight. when they start to go at it, it was cool but i dont call it a fight scene"
3,KILL BILL VOL 2,Conditions of product were excellent and the delivery process very rapid. Would do business again.
4,good but over long,"As I stated in Vol 1 anybody else doing this movie would be told to make just one movie from the footage as some times the movie just goes off on one.What was the point of the bar sceane??????? the story did not move along, and it would not be missed if removed.Reason for 4 stars then well good fight sequences, some classic quotes and Uma"
4,Actually 3.8 stars...,"KB1 was rather silly [but in the name of satire, etc., etc], but 2 was well done. Lucky for Quint he chopped this flic in two. One was ""I can do this 'cause I'm a famous director"", but two was the dang movie. A proper mix of pretty good story with cool chop-chop. Those who followed Kung-Fu into the 2nd season pilot would love the ending (includes me, obviously).I= kinda sillyII= coolSee it.Tejas"
3,One was way better,Two is just two.One is everything.The picture and sound are decent. Not perfect.Sometimes boring comparing to part one.
3,The daughter justifies all,"This is definitely not Tarantino's best. There are some seriously disturbing scenes in this movie involving children and frankly the idea is that all is justified by revenge and by the fact that the protagonist gets her child back. I cannot help but wonder if this is some kind of post 9/11 self justification movie. These seem to be getting more common; witness Battlestar Galactica and all of its melodrams, or even War of the Worlds. Our ethical values of much of the last century are being challenged and not for the better either. The real crime here however, is that the movie is hackneyed. The idea that all of the violence and death is justified by revenge and getting the little girl is so old it is pathetic.Nevertheless the movie is visually stunning albeit a sort of diseased Charlies Angels."
2,"Still better than most, but definatley lacking","very long drawn out lifeless film with SOME good parts. The worst thing is they tease you with this great possible ending by mentioning this showdown on the beach under the moonlight, but they don't deliver. The actual ending sucks. Carradine may be old but I'm sure they could've got around it and had him in some good action sequences. Overall I left the film dissapointed."
5,Kill Bill Volume 2,"Yes! Volume 2 ties the Kill Bill series together so nicely. It fulfills the classic Tarantino dialogues and storylines. But it also has amazing fighting scenes reflective from the crazy first volume. The fight between Elle Driver and The Bride is crazy and is the best thing ever. The movie becomes surprisingly very touching near the end and the soundtrack goes SO well with it (take a listen to those songs, by the way). Some people found it too slow (volume 2) but if you watch the first and the second together, which is what was meant to happen, it works perfectly. Amazing movie. Great action. Great story. Great acting and characters. So memorable."
2,The martial art of Mom Fu,"If you turn your mind off and go along for the ride, there's plenty of Uma, mayhem, Uma, nicely-done fights, and Uma.Plausibility? Well, not a lot. I suspended disbelief until my arms got tired, then the implausibility of the Holy Mother, loud noises that no one notices, and day to day use of a visible sword as fashion accessory kind of got to me. Cripes, does every cold-blooded, female killer in the world get all mushy over kids? And some of the guys, too? I almost expected to see the first ultrasound tattooed on someome's arm.OK as airplane entertainment, as long as it's free and there's no way to get out of the plane. Missable otherwise.-- wiredweird"
3,Gargantuan.,"I feel that if Vol 1 and Vol 2 were put together into one 3 hour movie, I think I'd be more pleased. I loooved Vol 1 (it was my favorite movie of 2003) and expected soo much more to happen in Vol 2 (especially the final scene with Bill). Although Vol 2 answered many questions from Vol 1, I think that there was a lot of slow parts in the movie that could have been edited out. This is more emotional, dramatic and talky than the first installment. However, this is more worth watching than the new movies that are infesting theaters right now."
3,"Different feel, excellent acting","Even though vol. 2 is the continued second half of vol. 1, the two movies don't match up in terms of style. Where vol. 1 is action-packed and over-the-top gory, vol. 2 is restrained, polite, and even a little touching. I was disappointed with the lack of action that vol. 1 so clearly delivered as well as with the revelation of the Bride's name; it added nothing to the story or her character, and I wanted to laugh at their choice of moniker.Darryl Hannah and Uma Thurman and the Pai Wei-man, however, give amazing performances.I say don't expect the blood, guts, and violence of the first film, and you might appreciate it more than I did."
3,QT is cashing in,"ok dont get me wrong i like kill bill vol 2 (the dialogue was amazing) but i had a problem with the fact that it was incredibly slow paced at times. the movie was a little too long for an ""action"" movie that had about 6 min of total fighting in it/ but thats ok because i understand what QT was trying to bring out in the second film so that doesnt bother me. my problem is that i think he's cashing in. yes QT does steal from the best (he might as well be brian de palma's fluffer) but i think at times it was overdone and he stretches out a pretty basic plot. revenge. I still think that this movie could have been combined to make one kikass film (that should have lasted anywhere from 2.5 to 3.5 hours.) the fact that he made too seperate films and made us wait all this time and now after seeing both movies i can easily say it was all for the $ and this could have been ONE awesome friggin film."
5,One of Quentin Taratino's Finest!,"Kill Bill I and II are Quentin's homage to 70s genre action flicks, most notably the Shaw Brothers. Full of action from the get-go, he packs every scene with action. A must see!"
4,Entertaining in a way that only Tarantino can entertain,"This movie has the feel of a comic book brought to life (in fact, the first half of the movie actually has a segment consisting of comic book animation). This stylistic choice enables Tarantino to present a lot of potentially very disturbing material, especially abundant violence in Volume 1, while making this material reasonably palatable (and I generally don't like watching violence). It also gives the movie a sort of surreal and twisted feel which makes the movie suprisingly engrossing. On the other hand, the plot and characters are relatively cartoonish (though the acting is solid), and I didn't really discern much deeper meaning in the movie, despite a total running time of about 4.5 hours. In short, this movie is entertaining in a way that might even tempt you to watch it more than once, but don't look for anything more than entertainment."
5,Surpasses Volume 1 in Every Way,"Visually, Kill Bill Vol. 1 was spectacular. The fighting sequences were not only imaginative, but stunning. Vol. 1 was almost non-stop carnage, and little dialogue. The real, snappy dialogue that Tarantino has used to make his movies, particularly Pulp Fiction, worth watching a dozen times was missing. Vol 2 gets the balance right, containing all the best qualities of any of Tarantino's masterpieces. It's inhabited by surreal people casually saying outrageous things that should curl your hair. David Caradine, the former soft-spoken, confrontation avoiding Kane of Kung Fu, is riveting as the homicidal maniac Bill. No doubt, Caradine's sinister, blood-thirsty Bill is so startling because we cannot entirely displace the gentle Kane from our minds. Still, Tarantino included in both volumes material that should have landed on the cutting room floor. With a little discipline, Tarantino could have made a one volume movie masterpiece."
2,"Not for small children, not for children period","Kill Bill Number 2 DVDKill Bill Number 2 is a continuation of Kill Bill Number 1, of course, this time Uma Thurman finishes her revenge. Nothing like a woman scorned.Somewhat recommended for fans of Uma Thurman and Quentin Tarantino's highly stylized revenge sagas.Warning somewhat bloody.Gunner March 2008"
4,Great Film,"I love this movie specially because the day I went to the see it, my f**kin girlfriend lefted me, so I kind of enjoyed all the blood and the great story by Quentin his just great, This DVD is a must have for all you action movie lovers, like me . . ."
3,HYPE DOESN'T CUT IT,"Why did so many people have a problem with this movie, you ask? It's not brilliant, but it's not terrible, so what's the problem? Perhaps it was because there was only one effective action scene, or the fact most of the time characters are just bantering to each other? Maybe it was the inconsistent cheesy camera work or silly canned music?No, people were upset because this was advertised as a ""violent"" movie, when it simply isn't. True action fans prefer more brutal hard-edged masculine movies like Peckinpah's ""The Wild Bunch, Siegel's ""Dirty Harry,"" Hensleigh's ""The Punisher"" or Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver."" In ""Kill Bill"" the violence is silly like a kid's movie. There is also too much female melodrama. If I want that I'll watch the Lifetime woman's channel, thank you.Tarantino deserves credit for trying, but unfortunately this is just another one of those ""hype-movies"" that will fade into oblivion as soon as the studio's marketing juggernaut runs out of steam."
3,Mediocre ending and much more...,"After vol.1, I expected better but I suppose that the 2nd of anything is never better than the first. The ending was too toned down and they should have stuck with the alternate ending that was going to show Uma and Dave swordfighting on the beach! The only reall high point to this film is the big altercation with Elle and Bea. Still a good movie to have, though."
3,"Pretty good, but way overrated","The Bride (Uma Thurman) completes her mission to kill Bill (David Carradine), dispatching a few other obstacles along the way. This film is quieter than the first, much to its detriment. Volume 1 managed to overcome writer/director Quentin Tarantino's directorial gimmicks and stilted dialogue during its many inspired action scenes. Here, the gimmicks remain but there is less action to redeem it. Something in me still responds to his characters, but I think Tarantino is well on his way to being the most overrated director of our time. The long, geeky speeches that seemed fresh in ""Pulp Fiction"" are tipping over the border into self-parody (although I did think that David Carradine's speech about Superman toward the end was brilliant; whoever makes the next movie about the Man of Steel should take note). With all the critical and popular success he is enjoying, there is no reason to expect him to restrain himself in the future./"
2,Collapse,"Wha' Happened?!?Kill Bill Vol. 1 was SUCH a great film; action-packed, thrilling, inventive, sexy and funny.Kill Bill Vol. 2, on the other hand, is a bore. Tedious and childish. From the first few seconds, when Uma overacts a monologue rehashing of Vol. 1, through two dull but bloody hours right up until David Carradine's half-asleep pseudo-philosophical ramblings, there is nothing of real interest here.What a let down."
5,Excellent!,"Pure Tarantino genius. Vol.2 wraps up Vol.1 perfectly. Vol.1 is action-driven while Vol.2 gives us the story behind the action and fleshes out the characters. Uma Thurman is incredible as ""The Bride"" taking care of ""unfinished business"" with the infamous Bill. In the words of Elle Driver, ""pretty cool, huh."" Watch this movie, you'll be blown away."
4,Eye-Smashing Good,"Kill Bill Volume Two Is 2.7 Times Better Than Kill Bill Volume One was. If you don't believe me, buy it from Amazon.com and watch it for yourself. Preferably on Blu-ray. I say this because that 'scree-scree' fork against skin music when Bea Kiddo L.H.S. alone sounds awesome in Blu-ray. And may I add this flick has easily the best acting performance ever done by a black mamba? Pure method!"
4,Killing Me Softly...,"Alert: DO NOT SEE KILL BILL 2 IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN VOL. 1 FIRST! Recommendation: Anyone attempting to see KB 2 MUST present a legitimate KB 1 ticket stub or a receipt for the KB 1 DVD as a prerequisite to admission to KB 2. Most individuals I've spoken with don't like KB 2. Why? They didn't see KB 1. (My older son is an exception). They are (not) very different films: KB 1: hate with chop, chop; KB 2: hate HOLD the chop, chop. As KB 1 gave us a taste, KB 2 is a wonderful exhibition of the genius of Mr. T. But you have to see them in sequence (KB 1 then KB 2)to fully appreciate the emotional continuity of take care.(This is to verify that my only fiscal connection to the films is the cash for admission to KB 2. I received KB 1 as a gift.)"
1,Gore galore,"This applies to Kill Bill 1&2.Purveyors of ketchup and fake body parts are exstatic. The fight scenes are just as unrealistic as those of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon but entirely lack their grace and elegance, with one exception. The exception being Lucy Liu's excellent performance.One scene has fastened in my mind's eye: Lucy Liu at the head of her warriors, seen from the side and in silhouette. She, in a white long kimono, holding her black sheathed sword at her side, striding/gliding in a manner conditioned by her Japanese sandals; they, all in black.I don't know how it all ended - I ran out of patience partway thru the second part!"
3,"it was ok, not as good as the first volume","I found this one, went too much into detail. Finally we get to see Bill, Pai Mai, Elle, and Budd. But I was so use to her kicking so much tail in the last one, this one had me so hyped for this one, and I couldn't get too much into it. I found the ending to be kinding wack in a way. I think the western style setting just wasn't good to me. But when Black Mamba found her daugher and her fight with Elle was cool. But anyways, if you wanna rent it, watch it on DEMAND, or wait til STARTZ be my guest."
3,ugh!,"this movie definitely is not vol.1. there were a few scenes i enjoyed. pai mei's scene (very funny) elle's scene, budd's scene i also liked the fact it showed uma's feminine side. way too many anecdotes!"
3,Good but not great,"Vol. 2 was a little long and not as bloody then the first. I was so excited about seeing vol 2, but it was a bit of a put down. It needed to have more violence and less emotion."
2,Corny as expected.....,"When I first saw a preview, I said to myself...What a F***?? The yellow haired western women wearing Bruce Lee Uniform from a movie GAME OF DEATH, and holding a Japanese Katana. Hmmm...This does not make sense. and ANNOYINGLY LONG TWO Series~!!! Years later, I saw the film when my friend insisted to see it. What a stupid corny movie~!!! I liked the music, and artistic screen, so it gets two stars."
1,One of the worrst movies.......,Kill Bill 1 is one of the best movies I have ever seen but then when I saw kill bill 2 I was so upset.... I watched the movie with my mother and father and my mom fell asleep and my dad wanted to fast foward....... The movie took too long to long to get to the point and there was a certain part of the movie where she is talking to a spanish guy looking for bill and I dont understand why she needed help finding bill but she didnt need help finding all those other people she killed....... Well i dont want to tell people not to buy or see the movie only because every 1 has there own opinion in what makes a movie good but i have to say the movie was very bad......
2,Someone get Quentin a Dialogue Editor!!,"ZZZZZZZZ... Part 1 was good, but someone needs to do an intervention with Quentin. Not every word that he produces on the page is gold. Some of it is out and out awful. Examples: Huge chunks of David Carradine's speeches at the end, and Darryl Hannah's snake/notebook crap. A good editor could have made this movie at least a half hour shorter. Even the most indulgent Italian westerns weren't paced as glacially as this mess.A few good action scenes, but little else to recommend for two and a half hours of your time."
2,"If you've seen Volume 1, STOP!!!","I highly anticipated the second part but was very disappointed with this movie. You can definitely tell that this movie was supposed to be one part instead of two. Cut out all the mindless jabber, the unnecessarily prolonged ending and the dismal climax and you'd have a good movie. Otherwise, stick to the first one which was a lot better. The only reason I gave it two stars was because of the funny ""training"" scene. Maaayyyybeeee a rental. Maybe..."
2,Zzzzzzzzzzzz!,"Too long. Could easily cut 45 minutes off this movie. The vol 1 was entertaining, not this one. At least, I know now how this story end. Was happy to rent it and not to spend 15$ at the theater for this movie."
3,Kill Bill 2,"Quentin Tarantino's KILL BILL Vol.1 was fantastic. This time around however, the action feels a little under-cooked, and while there are some razor-sharp trademark Tarantino lines and some great fight scenes (Especially the nastiest cat-fight ever committed to film between Uma's Bride and Daryll Hannah's Elle Driver), some scenes drag on for too long and halfway through you get the feeling that this whole exercise could have been compacted into a single 3-Hour film. The highlights are the aforementioned EYE-catching brawl and Pei Mei's tutalage of the Bride. Still. it lacks momentum enough to keep the interest for long. Nevertheless, it's very refreshing to see a film bereft of CGI screen mugging and Hollywood pretty boys posing through the whole movie. A must-see for sure, but something of a disappointment compared to the fantastic excess of Volume 1."
5,A wonderful conclusion,"The questions raised by the first chapter are answered. I actually liked this volume better than the first - it's a nailbiter, humorous yet morose, and I love the old kung fu movie style present in many scenes. It's also more personal - the bride will have her revenge."
3,typically Tarantino . . .,"An extension of the first film, only a few more ghastly punches and twists, Tarantino stays true to form . . . if you like that kind of form."
5,Classic,"Tarantino at his best, classic movie still enjoyable today as it was back in college. Rent this today if you have never seen it."
3,What a Let Down,"After Vol 1, this is a poor sequel. I really was looking forward to this, the follow up and the tie up of the loose ends from Vol 1. There was very little action, to much blah blah blah soul searching etc, for me. The only real satisfaction I got, was she got her revenge with Bill, and the ending was quite nice, reuniting with her daughter. The acting was excellent, as one would expect from name actors like David Carradine, Uma Thurman, and Daryl Hannah etc which saved it for me. I was expecting a lot more, and unfortunately it didn't deliver"
4,Kill Bill ll,Arrived before Xmas which was good. No complaints from beneficiary. I liked the fact I was kept advised of the location of the product as it moved through the shipping maze.
2,not as good as Volume 1,"There is less action in this volume than in the first, which makes it more tedious. To be fair this is just the wrap up of Volume 1, but I found the second installment to be quite boring at times. There are several scenes that could have been cut from both volumes and they should have been combined into a single movie. Splitting the movie was a cheap grab for more money and this ploy should not be tolerated in the future. Worth a rent if you've already seen Volume 1 and need closure. Otherwise skip it."
3,"Huge Expectations, Little Satisfaction","Let me start by saying I LOVE KILL BILL 1. That being said my expectations for this movie were sky high. I gave 3 stars for simple fact that I should be grading on a curve because it is probably not that bad, I had too high expectations. The action in this movie was very dull to me and she didnt have enough interaction with Bill, Elle, and Buddy (the three remaining death squad members.) I love the story, but it was slow and wasnt Tarrentino esqu to me. I hear there will be a third volume involving Vernita Green's daughter so I will look forward to that but as for this movie if you are a fan of the series, watch it for conclusion but, I suggest going in with lower expectations"
2,Um....What went wrong?,"The first one ruled. But when the second one came out- Everything went wrong.Too much talking and blah blah blah in this movie. In the first movie my eyes were wide, in this one, they were shut.Now the scene of Uma coming out of the coffin through the dirt was straight out unreal. I didn't know if I was watching action or a Sci-Fi movie.I give it two stars because there were some scenes that were kind of cool- To mention the kung fu master scenes and the 4th Assassin losing her left eye.I don't even want to go about the ending how Bill dies. There could've been more to it.Don't waste your time renting this or buying it on DVD."
1,Quentin LOVES Uma...,"...and obviously cares very lttle about making cohesive, thought-provoking cinema any more. Sure, he is known for his collection of Seventies' B-movies, and literally throws in as many references as he can in this one. But if Kill Bill Vol.1 was at least an often funny, irreverent and well-choreographed tribute to the trash films of the 1970s, Vol. 2 is his love note to star Uma Thurman. He manages to capture every angle possible of the wraith-like Thurman and loses no self-created opportunity to get close-up shots of her face, mud-spattered and all.This film has the look and feel of being a slapped-together mish-mash of outtakes from Vol. 1, with ridiculous B-movie dialogue tacked on, and a story appearing to have been created as a means of tying up loose ends at the last minute.Awful, simply awful. And this was the same guy who gave us Reservoir Dogs..."
1,I got something for Kevin K,Nas never stole 2pacs music on illmatic.Nas was bigger at the time.2Pac and Nas are the my all time Favorites.One man that is not a 2Pac biter is Nas.Infact they did not even like each other that much.But anyway this movie sucks too so you got 2 things.This is no beef it is just telling the facts
1,Let me tell you....,"...'bout the birds and the bees, and the flowers and the trees, and the moon up above, yada, yada, yada. We all know the song, just like we all know the Kill Bill saga is one long violent, bloody, amoral MESS. I promised myself and my Lord that I would not watch volume 2, but my friend's daughters assured me that the second half was far superior.Friends and fans (of my reviews! Unite!), let me tell you this movie is even more violent and disturbing than the first one. I'm glad I ate light before watching, because I surely would've tossed my cookies in a literal sense when watching a woman trapped underground in a coffin! Yeah, it's that bad.This movie sets the feminist movement (which I'm part of, and proud of it) backwards about 15-20 years. Uma Thurman has been celebrated for becoming a walking skeleton. Sure, she mastered a rare form of ninjitsu while preparing for a physically demanding role. But it doesn't make her a ""role-model,"" just ask Mary-Kate Olsen."
3,See it if you're not a real fan...!,"If you are a real fan you'll know that this is not the best he's done.Submitting to the pressures of Hollywood film making, Quentin has strayed from his edgy, pushy, shocking classics like Dogs, Pulp, True Romance, and From Dusk...To those of you who have no idea what I'm talking about, please see this film! It will introduce you to the best film maker of the last 25 years. To those of you who disagree with me, see Sergio Leone and Alan Parker. See James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart in a new light. See Lucio Fulci."
4,"Slower, Quieter, More Explanatory and Still Great","Part two of Kill Bill is excellent in it's own right. As the second part of the duo, though, it lacks a little of Part One's energy. Hence the 4 rather than 5 stars on this entry. Uma continues to amaze here as the Bride and in this installment, I half expected her to have a shootout with Eastwood - both wearing dusters, of course! Hannah is a hoot in this and her showdown with the Bride gives Lucy Lui a run for her money. Excellent follow-up to an even more excellent begining."
5,The Genious that is Kill Bill Vol. 2,"If you have seen the first one this latest edition is slightly different. Rather thatn a kungfu flick this movie is more of a spaghetti western. It is executed perfectly keeping the whimsical characters the funny hijinks and the off the wall fight scenes while tieing the story up pure genious. The chinese martial arts master is by far the best character in the movie with his random beard swinging and funny expressions. If you havent seen any of these movies you are retearded and should pick up the first one on dvd and see the 2 in theatres, also check out tarantinos other films they have to be watched as well."
5,Kill Bill Volume II Great Movie,We enjoyed it. The music is great and the acting/violence worth the price of admission. They sure don't make 'em like this anymore. Recommended!!
5,Pleasantly Surprised,"I have had trouble with buying used movies in the past, even on ones labeled ""like new,"" but I was pleasantly surprised to see that this movie was in perfect condition, as was the case. The movie is also great too."
2,The DVD is Much Better Than The Theatrical Release,"After Having watched the DVD release, I confess I was too harsh. The ""making of Kill Bill 2"" In the extra features agave me a different perspective and I will change my rating to 4-STARS. Also, there is a deleted scene will DAvid Carradine (Bill) taking on a gang in an old ""kun-fu"" theater sword fight and hand-to-hand fight that was absolutely thrilling. It was a real shame to see it left out of the final cut. A must buy on DVD."
2,"Not a very satisfying ending to the ""Kill-Bill"" series","I was really expecting more. If the middle of the movie was all there was to ""Vol. 2"", I would give it 4 stars."
3,A Letdown,"I liked the first volume, despite the fact that it was mostly plotless, because it was very pretty in all its carnage. Volume 2, however, spends a lot of time on a plot that bothered me more and more when I thought about it. In the end, I found it overly simplistic and irritating (trying not to give anything away here). I kept waiting for a twist that never came. While the first volume was mostly fluff, a lot of style with no substance, it was enjoyable as that at least. The second volume has more plot, but this does not end up as more substance. But in the second volume, the time that is spent on the plot takes away from the style and we end up with two and a half hours which are not very enjoyable."
2,Do it over!,"As a fan of the original, I was expecting fast pacing, action and lots of fight scenes. I was disappointed. For every 5 minutes of good stuff, there were 30 minutes of fluff.I would have cut several scenes out or at least in half: The ""strip club"" scene was a waste. The ""Superman"" speech was lame. The ""wedding rehearsal"" was a useless.David Carradine's character kept telling drawn-out stories and kept telling them. I was sitting there thinking, ""Come on already. Get to the point, Bill!""KB2 was the equivalent of ""Empire Strikes Back"" with Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader sitting down for a chat instead of fighting.Someone needs to re-do this movie with some decent fight scenes and a lot more emphasis on Uma. Bill was scarier when you did not see him in KB1."
3,Dissapointing,"Man, I went into the theater with high expectations and hopes for this movie, but walked out feeling so dissapointed. This movie just doesn't deliver like Vol.1. It really did a good job of explaining a lot like the story that was left unanswered and Bill's motives for betraying Uma Thurman. The fight scenes are hardly rememberable, only a couple, and they don't last very long. She doesn't even fight Budd, whos fight I was really looking forward to, and she hardly fights Bill in the final confrontation, not the best way to end it.Her whole goal throughout the movies is to Kill Bill and she kills him in the lamest way possible. Sorry, maybe next time Quentin. It's worth a one time see, but that's it."
1,What happened?,"I am a big fan of the Q man, but what the heck did I just watch? I like twists, but after watching all 4 hours of the Kill Bill epic I felt like I had been robbed. Volume one was great lots of action, humor and symbolism. Volume 2 (with some execptions) was just empty and predicable. At the end I hated everything and everybody. There was no coolness, no latent hipness. No angst from somebody who was locked in a video store overnight - just a sort of sick contest to be the most unlikeable. There was a possiablity for a really cool ending that would have redemed some and explained more, but instead we just get a stupid joke and emptyness.I expected more."
4,Specifically pulling,I haven't noticed any more; but the one flaw in this movie is: nobody would except eating anything prepared by a man or woman if she/he extracted her/him eye.He/She certainly would kill the extractor. Would a master do that?
2,Very Disappointing,"I awaited this film anxiously for weeks. I even rented the 1st Vol. the day before (which is magnificent)and was totally disappointed. In Vol. 1 Uma Thurman is just plain AWESOME. A unique heroine with a mission. Here she appears weak. It is not just the lack of violence and gore like some reviewres say but, the film is so predictible, It takes a 180 degree turn in the story, cinematography, and even the characters appear weaker. It also tries to build up a climax (which everyone is awaiting) that never occurs. The final scene is so bleak I actually thought ""Ok, this was a cool joke.. now when are they going to show the real film"""
4,"Creative, but not for the Squeamish!","I am a fan of Uma Thurman. Add in the supporting cast, action and, yes, even humor, to this twisted revenge movie and I can watch it over and over even though I know the outcome!"
5,Love it!,"I already loved this movie and had to replace damaged DVDs I had and this is one of my favs. If you love the movie get it, if not don't, if you have never seen it you will probably like it!"
2,Chinese Copy?,"This is one of two Blu-rays I received which had very slight white grainy lines on the left side of the screen. It's not my Sony Blu-Ray player because all my other discs do not have this problem. Other then the lines the pic is sharp and clear, the lines are noticeable but not worth the expense to pay postage to return. Which leads me to wonder if these Blu-rays are knockoffs, maybe from China? Which is the biggest perpetrator of mass producing DVD's and dumping them on the U.S. internet market."
4,Not as good as the first one...,After being blown away by the first Kill Bill i was expecting epic battles for the conclusion but these never happened. Still it's a good conclusion for the story. I gave it four stars instead of three because the excellent death of Bill.
5,David Carridine for Best Supporting Actor!,"Now, I very rarely agree with the academy. I think David Carridine deserved an Oscar nod (not necessarily the award itself, but a nod) for his portrayal of Bill in ""Kill Bill vol 2"". He created the character perfectly. He had great dialogue, compliments of Quentin, and he knew exactly what to do with it. You feel for him, you get excited when he's on screen. He was, in a word, excellent.As for everyone else...Uma is great as always. I'll admit Darryl Hannah is a bit over-the-top, but I think it works. Micheal Madsen makes you feel kind of sorry for Budd...he was the only one who seemed to show real remorse (anyone else notice he bears an odd resemblance to Robert Rodriguez, who is from Terantino's home planet?)."
4,Excellent,"Well I hope I am one of the first to review KBV2. I thought it was most excellent. I gave it four stars, only because in the beginning of the film it was much different from V1. It was awkward for me, but eventually it got back into the flow of the movie as it had in V1. The sound effects had a great effect in this one, better then the first I believe. I liked how we got to know the Deadly Viper Assassin Squad more also. The dynamic cast of characters collaged this movie into a great composition. The ending credits really wrapped up both volumes very well. I cannot wait untill they come out in a package so I can buy it."
4,"Preffered Volume 1, but still enjoyed this one","People expecting the fast-paced action of Kill Bill, Voulume 1 may be disappointed by Volume 2...at times the story was painstakingly slow. However, the action scenes and background stories keep viewers interested. Those who appreciate Tarantino's quircky style will not be disappointed!"
4,6 female authors tackle the ancient world,"Hoberman's collection of 13 essays investigates the work of 6 female authors (Mitchison, Butts, Riding, Bentley, Bryher, and Renault) who wrote at the end of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century in England. Chapters 1, 2, 8, and 13 are very general as they look at the nature of education and gender roles in England during the lifetimes of these six authors. At times her analysis of how the real lives of authors are reflected in their work seems stretched to the limit -- but this could be claimed in most literary analysis. As a writer, I can say that yes, our lives affect our work, but how it affects it can only be truly understood by talking to the author herself and there is no evidence that Hoberman has done this. She uncovers a good number of books which I did not know exist and so I'm off to find a few of them."
4,Great for Beginners,"As a copywriter specializing in Real Estate I found this book to cover a lot of familiar ground. I didn't get any new information here, but I did find some of the statistics helpful, and it was helpful to see this information presented in a real estate specific format. I did condense most of the basic concepts in this book into a tip sheet for my realtors to help them write better listings, and any realtor who writes his or her own listings for advertising will find this book invaluable, especially the Appendices that give you ready to use headlines for different types of property.Any one beginning to write ads for real estate will find this book an excellent starting off point."
1,Awful,"This cable is so tangled and messy it's unmanageable. I use it to connect my guitar amplifier to a foot-switch for switching channels and it gets in the way and makes the space look cluttered and messy. If I had known that this cable would be so unmanageable, I would have spent a little more on a higher quality cable that didn't get in the way and be such a pain."
4,OK,"I bought this one for the quality of Lenevo products, for probably the highest total price, $12.57(listed price plus shipping and handling), among its peer products. It matches with my room design, being white and grey. I was worried when I received it. Its wrapping materials feel thinner than Belkins. But I am satisfied so far as it seems durable. I use it to connect my computer that is in the bed room from a ethernet port in another room. It is lied just under my bedroom door. I closed the door several times a today and there is not even a scratch on the wrapping material. So I guess it is again a high-tech staff, thin but stronge."
5,"Nice Cable, and a GE too!","When I bought this, I was just looking for a longer cable to connect my dsl modem to my airport express, so any cheap 25 ft cable would work for me. When the cable arrived, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was a General Electric cable, very nice and packaged well instead of the ""Some Records"" cable advertised. Buy with confidence."
5,Delivered as advertised,Item arrived within a few days and has performed as advertised at a fraction of the cost charged by stores like Best Buy. Would buy again.
4,Nice book on how Foundations stray from their founder's intent,"As time goes on most Foundations stray from the original intent of the founder. This is certainly true in the last twenty years, where conservative founders during the early 1900's left money aimed at specific causes, and now the foundations they funded have become very liberal organizations that do not even try to pretend they are serving the will of the founder. This book goes into problem, but I don't forsee this problem changing in the near future."
5,Chris Gracey's Danger Zone Review,"Danger Zone, Sammy's 1980 release, was not only my introduction to Sammy Hagar, but remains my all time favorite.My favorite songs are In The Night ( Entering Thre Danger Zone ), Love Or Money and 20th Century Man.The Production Quality of In The Night... is incredible! Especially for 1980's standards.This song remains my all time favorite Hagar song. I also have enjoyed many single Hagar hit's since 1980 but for an album as a whole this is my favorite.I would also like to recommend his first two albums as a member of Van Halen.5150 and OU812. EXCELLENT! Enjoy."
3,Not a new book!,"Even though the ""product details"" specify ""1 edition (March 23, 2009)"" this is in fact a reprint of a 20-year old book. Buy it for historical reasons and for Laver's authority. Don't buy it for any new information on developments in the field, which have been very extensive and rapid due to the progress in signal processing."
2,loveseat saver,I measured my love seat and ordered the appropriate size. It came and it was too small.Even if it was the right size I don't think it would make a difference.This sofa saver... isn't.
2,Not what I envisioned,The loveseat saver did not do what I thought it would do. I put it under my cushions and I can't really tell any difference. I would have liked to have had it firm up my loveseat at least a little but it didn't at all.
2,Too flimsy,"Loveseat Saver (Black) (1/2""H x 44""W x 19""D)I wouldn't recommend this product, we bought this a few weeks ago and it's added no additional support to our loveseat. Product is too flimsy to provided any support an basically just sinks into an already sagging couch."
2,loveseat supporter,I expected great results from the seat support but I feel very little difference. The cushions still sink and sag. It is hard to distinguish between seating with the seat support inplace and not having it under the cushions. I think all seat guards are constructed in the same fashion so I do not think one brand is better than another. Maybe if my cushions were thinner it would of helped.
1,Still Sagging,I ordered this and the one for the sofa waste of money both are still sagging.Would not not reccomend for anyone to purchase!!!!I did not want to give this product any stars but guess you have to give one to sumit your review unfair
3,Old Stuff,"When this lp first came out I wore out the grooves and bought it again but that was a different time in our American lives. It's about sex, drugs and rock-and-roll. It's too slow for my more-modern taste. Some of the tunes still stand; but you can find those tunes at a modest price. This cd should be retired."
2,murky sound,"Forget this Capital slapdash collection and buy the much better Rhino remastering with much better selection: ""Sons of Mercury"". See my review there.Poor selection here, also, not enough wonderful Cippolina, too much Valenti.murky, compressed, midrangy"
4,The band that was around,"The band liked to play live and didn't record their music for a very long time but, finally did get into the studio so that being analogged so we, future generations can appreciate the mindset of the common people of the period. Not so much the commercially successful ie: Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, Big Brother & the Holding Company... But a technical jam-band from the 60's who liked to play live which am sure that they did very well."
5,A book for everyone,"This book is outstanding in every respect. The cover, however, I feel may unfortunately narrow its readership - ""Therapeutic Guidelines for Working with Gender-Variant People and Their Families."" I am a lay person who is fairly well read on the subject matter and I find that this book would valuable for anyone to read. It has the potential to help emancipate the transgendered population that is still stigmatized and oppressed by the medical profession and society including religion and politics. It certainly should be required reading for policy makers in the government, the legal profession, the justice system, human resource personnel, etc. The book is not only well researched and well written, it is easily understandable by anyone, meaning that no background in the field of psychiatry is required to be able to appreciate the material. The book is very up-to-date (2004). The Publisher would do well to advertise this book to a wider audience."
2,Wasn't what they said it was,The item was supposed to be stainless and it is only chromeitem is ok and I will use it but wasn't stainless steel as the adsaid.
1,No drill brackets,"No drill brackets I guess means the brackets have holes not that you don't need to drill holes in your frame to mount it. After a few attempts to mount the steps I figured out that the front mounting plates marked DF goes on the Passenger Front side and the one marked PF goes on the Driver Front. Also the hole for mounting the step is cut to give you room to get past the chassis mount is cut vertically and not horizontally which means you need a hammer to make it fit. Fix those two things and make the directions better and you would have an okay product.Smittybilt JN460S2S Sure Steps Stainless Steel 3"" Side Bar, Pair"
2,Look good after lengthy install.,"I installed these on my 2002 Jeep TJ. The bars were about 1/2 inch too short to reach the supplied brackets. I was able to modify the brackets to fit but they don't allow enough adjustment to make the bars appear parallel to the side of the Jeep. Don't get me wrong, they still look a lot better than the factory running boards. I just thought these Smittybuilt bars would be engineered for an exact fit. There were missing lock and flat washers but I had some in my hardware box that worked."
5,BRILLIANT TRULY BRILLIANT,"Coming of age is a masterpiece in itself, the dvd and the live cd. The guitar solo's of Andy latamir are fantastic and like none other, they show great beauty. In the songs Rose of Sharon and Drafted, they show incredible musicianship and talent as these 2 songs are 2 of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard. I also believe that Hymn To Her is a wonderful song as well with its catchy vocals and wonderful guitar work. CAMEL DESERVES MORE RESPECT THAN ANY OTHER BAND, THEY ARE EXTREMELY TALENTED. I really appreciate what they do and i would give anything to be able to see them in concert."
4,Andy Latimer - Never Let Go!,"Found this in the shops. I didn't realise Camel were still touring so bought it. Brilliant album! Andy's guitar is as good as ever, as demonstrated in the beautiful and haunting ""Ice"". ""Sasquatch"" picks up the pace again and is better live. I've seen Camel twice - late 70's, early 80's. After hearing this would love to do so again. Please tell me next time you tour in the UK!"
2,GE TL-96145 Battery,"These are great batteries for the intended purposes. However, there is a lot of old stock out there. Some of the old stock that has been around for a couple of years or longer will not hold a charge."
2,A Story Still Needing To Be Told,"As someone considering moving to Cape Coral, I was very interested in learning about it's history. This book is not the one to tell you that. While it is loaded with various stories as retold through various sources, it is possibly one of the most poorly written/put-together books I have ever read. Contradictions are everywhere, and information is given as though the reader knows every inch of Cape Coral intimately. Much of the information given leaves you asking ""Why?"" and ""How?"" too many times to consider this an informative book.That being said, it is worth reading to at least gain some idea of how Cape Coral came to be...the story of Cape Coral is truly an amazing one, and hopefully I can find a more in-depth account of it somewhere!"
3,Glib approach to southern culture,"Sadly, this book is ""more of the same"": poke fun of the hillbillies. It seems written from an MFA grad-student approach with an NPR polish applied. Light and witty, urban, no real feel for the subjects. Humor is great, of course, but here it doesn't quite work: there's a disconnect. A bit of a snotty tour of the South.Sure, I had some laughs and learned some things, but...The old Ten Speed Press books on white trash cooking are funny yet also connected, so it can be done.I bought this book while exploring southern culture awhile back. I usually hang on to books more than I should. But this thin, slick little thing got sold.In contrast, Grady McWhiney's ""Cracker Culture"" is insightful, original and astonishing. And I've kept it."
2,I guess it's too much to ask for any originality,"I swear all the metalcore bands get together and decide on a set of riffs that they all will use on their next album. Let me say, I loved the first Agony Scene record. It mixed blacked metal influence with a more modern feel. It gave them an original sound. Now, however, they figured if they wanted all the ""OC"" metalcore bros to get into them they had to adopt the formulaic approach of As I Lay Dying or Atreyu. With mixing cheesy sounding melodic singing that is reminscent of Drowning Pool to ""killer breakdowns dood"", there is nothing on this record that you couldn't find on the last Killswitch or Bleeding Through offering. Every song pretty much sounds the same. This album was very dissapointing for me and I would recomend that you wait for the new Every Time I Die before you spend your money."
1,Uninspired,"After having thoroughly enjoyed the first Agony Scene album, I was extremely disappointed with this one. It's completely uninspired and sounds like every other metalcore band on the planet. The addition of clean vocals can work well with some bands (As I Lay Dying, for example) but the clean vocals on this record do not work at all and make it extremely lame. Stick with the first album instead"
1,Hell No!,"Dude alright I fell in love with The Agony Scene on there 1st cd. It was amazing! One of the best cds I heard in a long ass time! Now I was really looking forward to there new CD. Once I heard a few snipits from them on this cd. WTF HAPPEND!? They sound like every single stupid ""hardcore scene"" band out there. There 1st cd wasnt really hardcore scene crap. It was pure (...) heavy metal! I really hope they wont fallow the scene and star makin (...)like there 1st CD."
4,"It's The Agony Scene, it's to be expected","This album is great... The vocals are stunning, and the drumming fast and exciting, and the guitars punishing. I don't see why everyone thinks ""Procession"" is a bad song, when it's pretty much the best on the whole album. This album is slighty better then their self-titled, but both are great buys. My favorite tracks are ""Procession"", ""My Dark Desire"", ""Scars of Your Disease"", ""Prey"", and ""The Darkest Red""."
5,Good stuff,"I have been listening to Still Remains and It dies today alot lately so The Agony scene definitely fits in well to my current lineup. There is are so many great heavy riffs and double bass drumming on this cd. Especially in Procession and Suffer which is an amazing song. The clean vocals fit in very well and are used at the right time. I like clean vocals alot but I am so glad that some songs are dedicated to just pure screaming. My personal favorites are Procession,Suffer,Scapegoat and Prey(awesome chorus). If your into groups like Still Remains then get this cd. Oh and am I the only that hears a little bit of a DevilDriver sound in Scapegoat. Thats a good thing. Anyway go buy this cd."
4,good followup,"the album is great hands down. they didn't go softer for the mainstream.. the clean vocals are actually some of the most heavy clean parts you will find on any album. killswitch goes melodic when they sing.. the agony scene keeps the same beat as the rest of the song, yet still manages to get good clean vocals in. i think they did a great job of incorporating more influences into a the limited sound that their debut album left them. two thumbs up"
4,BASICS,"THIS BOOK IS VERY GOOD FOR A NEWLY ENGAGED COUPLE. IF YOU KNOW A COUPLE WHO IS VERY YOUNG AND WANT TO MARRY I WOULD DEFINITELY SUGGEST THIS BOOK. YOU WOULD BE SURPRISED AT HOW MANY PEOPLE DO NOT STOP TO THINK ABOUT THE ABSOLUTE BASICS. THEY DO NOT KNOW HOW TO FORM A SOLID RELATIONSHIP. MANY PEOPLE WOULD BENIFIT FROM THIS ""BASIC"" BOOK OF KNOWLEDGE."
3,Used for my evening class,"OK for a class setting. Doesn't get into essential stuff like counting, travel type conversations like 'Where is the bathroom?', 'Take me to the airport.' etc. Emphasis on long-term learning. Used by many higher ed institutions though. CD recording is good and helpful."
1,still waiting on package for poor service and no info on package on as to when shipped and how..,i am mad cause i have not recive any word on this item i ordered.....
1,Don't expect to use while driving.,Works ok if your are parked along the side of the road. Noise cancellation does not cancel out road noise. Callers on either side can not hear the conversation when driving at moderate speeds. The volume control on the unit does not work. It does not increase the volume of the phone. The speaker phone capabilities of my Motorola V710 phone work as well if not better than this add on.
2,Nice concept - poor sound quality,"While a very attractive concept, in use the sound quality of these units for the caller who calls the Parrot EZDRIVE is rather muffled and difficult to understand. I purchased two of them for each of our cars and they both have the same problem (so it is not because of a defective unit). Also the voice prompts for answering the phone and ending the call do not seem to work. But most importantly, the sound quality for the person at the other end of the call is far from acceptable."
4,Not Perfect but Lots of Positive Features,"First of all, this thing is surprisingly rugged. For people that complain about LCDs breaking, I have worn this thing all over in a small bag on a belt loop.Outdoors, it takes fantastic pictures. I travelled through France and the dynamic range and color are very good. I own a digital SLR but this thing is tiny and easy to carry.Low light performance is dependent on playing with the settings which people looking for a point and shoot normally don't want to do. It still has the great Fuji option of offering a dual picture with natural light and then with flash. Results will vary with user's ability.Finally, some people overlook the user interface. This is probably a personal preference but I like not having any tiny dials to turn. Everything is pushbutton."
4,Nice Camera,"Not a bad little camera for the price. If you just want a small pocketable camera that you can carry around for those not to be missed shots, this one is pretty good. If you're more interested in mega-megapixels, then you can upgrade to others. This one is accurate in color and clarity enough for the everyday picture-taker who just wants to capture the moment."
1,Horrible,"I purchased this camera and owned it for a year and a half, for the first couple of months the quality of the photographs was acceptable, but after the third of fourht month all the photographs lacked sharpness not to say that were blurry. I didn't do anything strange or hit it or anything, I didn't send it back because I live in Colombia - South America, but if I could I would have sent it back. I said I owned it because it was stolen 3 months ago."
1,"Poor quality, noisy images","I wanted to like the Finepix Z5fd - sleek looks, nice interface - but the images it produces are awful. I am aware of the noise issues that all digital cameras have to a greater or lesser extent, but this camera produced only adequate images and all showed substantial artifacts and noise when viewed '100 %' in any image viewing software.I'm returning this camera and will probably end up with a Leica. The Fujifilm seemed almost too good to be true at the price - and it turned out that it was."
3,finepixz5,"I've owned this camera for 3+ years now and am starting to look for a replacement. Although a decent Point&Shoot camera, I noticed a definite difference in picture quality when I compared my photos (prints and 'on-screen') to my sister's Point&Shoot Canon PowerShot, which is actually a year older than my z5. I've tried 'tooling' around with the different settings/options, but nothing changes. My images are definitely granier and 'softer'...not as crisp and clear as I would like. It is easy to use, but I am ready for an upgrade. Canon, here I come!"
3,Good camera but watch warrenty,"Bought this on Valentines...and its now June and my flash completely stopped on 5k pics. Replaced battery and still no go. Called Fuji film and they will only fix ""this common problem"" with an orginal recipt. Go figure. Other than that it was a Great camera while it lasted. Purchasing another but a dif model. Love the quality. Just short life spans. RIP my fav pink camera..sniffle."

4,Fin de siècle 1970,"10 original Walker-Songs, 5 covers. It's got a very fin de siècle-touch to it. It's more relaxed than Scott 4, except the opener; Joe and Time Operator are jazzy with existencial lyrics. This is kind of Scott 5. After this, Scott came back as a composer with Nite Flights 1978. I like it very much, even the sometimes very saccharin-pop covers. For me, together with Scott 3, it's the most autumn-feel album from Scott. Enjoy it."
5,Scott Walker Album Til The Band Comes In,As an avid Scott Walker from the Walker Brothers days I liked this album very much. Scott's voice still has that beautiful baritone it had from they heydays. My favorite song on this album is The War Is Over(Sleepers). Would recommend this to any Scott Walker fan.
5,Everyday Wear & Lovin It,I have used this perfume for years and continue to get compliments about it. Love it and will continue to use for years to come. I have tried so many other perfumes and never have I received as many compliments as I do with Hollywood.
5,Hollywood by Fred Hayman for Women - 3.4 Ounce EDP Spray,I looked online and compared the cost with other online stores and I felt like amazon had the best price. I love the smell of this fragrance and I'm asked all the time what it is I'm wearing. The scent last a long time even after I stop smelling it. This product is very much worth the cost. Great value for your money.
5,A fun little autobiography,"I really enjoyed this small, self-produced book. Karen is likable and has had an interesting life. I love how she weaved her spiritual study and the biblical basis of her Christian Science religion into her life story. As a woman of her generation, I could relate to her experiences, although not being much of a mountain climber, I found the history of her dad and his friends fascinating.It just shows that we all have a book in us - even if our lives seem more ""normal"" than special! We should all write, but most of us don't. Karen did, and I appreciate that."
5,Elevated,"If you are a religious person and are looking for something to elevate your faith, read this book! If you are not a religious person and are looking for something to elevate your mood, read this book. A simple read covering a lot of situations everyone can relate to. I was amazed that one small book could hold such a massive voice. A voice that is familiar,inspiring and worth listening to!"
5,Giving thanks should always be this much fun,"The author enjoys life, and she lets you in on her secrets to that enjoyment! An attitude of gratitude that brought her many blessings can bless the reader as well. Have you ever had a friend that looks at a glass as half empty rather than half full. Karen is the friend that knows it is full to overflowing, and, she knows why!I love the fact that each chapter is complete, and can be read as an individual story. The problem was that I was enjoying each chapter so much that I couldn't put it down until I had read the whole book!"
5,An honest accounting,"This is not ""Little House on The Prairie""! This is the real deal. It talks about country life and how difficult it is on men - and especially on women. It talks about the loneliness, and the importance of having family and friends. The novel is supposedly based on the life of the author's mother. If so, then her mother was one strong woman. In the book, the character's name is Melissa. She was only 15 when she married a man many years older than herself and settled into a less than happy marriage. She bore one child after another, and struggled to help provide for them. The story follows Melissa and her family over many decades. As the Country and the World changed, Melissa adapted to the changes as best as she could. She tried her hand at many different jobs. She refused charity.I really loved this woman, and this book. It rang so true. I read it in one day, as I couldn't put it down."
5,My 3rd grade son loved this book!,"Boys can be picky readers, so I always take notes if they actually love a book. My 8 year old carried this book everywhere and told be about it every night for a week. Besides Redwall or Harry Potter, this is the first book he has raved about."
5,"Wonderful experience, should be read by children everywhere.","My teacher read this book to our class when I was about 8 and I remember it was the only book where the whole class was silent and listened to every word! I have been trying to track this book down for the last few years as I could not remember the exact title (I thought it was 50 fathers!). Now I have found it at last I will look forward to reading it to my own children. Thanks to Mrs Mason, my class teacher at Christchurch Infants' School, Christchurch, Dorset for introducing it to me. It is a wonderful book, the story of which has stuck in my mind for many years since!"
4,Worth reading,"If you or a loved one has been on (or will be going on) Prednisone, this is a must read. I am currently 30 years old, and have been on and off Prednisone my entire life due to a lung problem. This has done EXTREME damage to my body that will last forever. It is nice to know that there are people out there that can relate."
2,Not Very Helpful,"I found this book not very helpful. I have Crohn's Disease and I have been on Prednisone for a year now and I bought this book right away. I was hoping for a more medical-technical resource, but this book has personal stories of one person. The advice they give is limted; for instance, not to eat salt and to exercise to help with weight gain. While this is all good, I knew this before, and I think you are better off searching the web or a newsgroup for more detailed information. This book was very highly recommended, and I just don't know why, it seems to be a big waste of money and it is sitting collecting dust."
2,This book read like a boring diary,"I am coping with the side effects of prednisone right now so my review may be a little harsh. This book wasn't exactly what I was looking for. It was more or less the side effects of one person and her story. I thought it was boring and I didn't find the book helpful in anyway except for a few good food tips. I could tell that this lady had it planned in the beginning to write this book from the start of her prednisone treatment.Maybe she should have interviewed and included other peoples stories of prednisone terror besides just her own. I read too many times in this book that ""side effects vary from person to person"".I don't recommend this book unless you want to hear the story of just one obviously prepared steroid user."
5,Great Book! Full of need to know info. about Prednisone.,This book has helped me so very much in my quest to gather info. about this medication. My young son has been on Prednisone for more than two years. It's hard for me to understand what he feels. This collaborative work has been a great help for me. This book is just what I've been looking for. Written for the patient in very understandable term. Thank you Dr. Inglefinger and Ms.Zuckerman.. Great Job!!!
2,not sure whether to purchase?,"I havent yet bought this product but i got its free trail when i bought a router. so far i dont even know how to set up a password for my network, only just a network name? im unsure whether to buy the actual program, all i want is to be able to share the network with a Macbook Pro that i have just bought.does anyone know if i buy 4.0 whether i can share the network without intruders,because so far there seems to be no way of getting a password on the trial."
4,Very Surprised,"What a good surprise this book was. I absolutely loved it. Love last forever, indeed. I adore Thor and Willow and the love they felt for each other. I was waiting to see if the time travel thing would be explained and it was not but that still did not stop me from enjoying the book. Past or present time, Thor could not stay away from Willow and their love for each other was certainly timeless.This book proved to be a very good read."
3,A Good Book,I liked this book. Thor was a well crafted character and Willow was very likeable. The end dragged on a bit but the book was still a delightful read. We definately need more IR SCIFI books out there. This was a great addition to the bunch.
3,More enjoyable than not,"Love Last Forever was an interesting book with an interesting time travel concept. The suspense is what held everything together. However, I was annoyed by how much they lusted after each other when i could have sworn that 'love' was part of the title. If the main characters were just a little interested in each other and not each other's bodies then i would have enjoyed it more. I was surprised to find that it is never explained how the timepiece works in order for Thor to get back and forth through time! That would have been cool to find out! lol And if I never hear 'Blessed be' again in my life, i wouldn't be disappointed. So this book could be better...but it isn't."
5,Great Story,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. Having been raised in Atlanta, I especially enjoyed the fact that the male lead character, Thor had been a quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons, and that the story itself took place in GA. The story was quite interesting and believable, and I thought the author did a really good job of transitioning the characters to and from the past with great ease. If you are a fan of stories with an historical theme, and an interracial love story, I highly recommend adding this wonderful book to your personal library."
1,False Advertisment,In the description it states a pack of 20. I thought this was a tremendous deal. So I order 3 packs. They showed up today and it is actually a pack of 2. Not a deal at all. I can buy them locally cheaper when you add in the shipping cost.
1,Disappointment At First Glance,"Given the price of kosher Yeminite Shofars I was willing to order this first out of curiosity. Upon opening the box I was met with instant disappointment. This is literally made out of cheap plastic, the kind used to make children's toys. The coloring is nothing like a real shofar and it isn't going to ""fool"" anyone. The sound it makes is commensurate with the cheap material it is made of. This is the type of item you might find in a childrens toy store and should only be sold as such for no more than $1.99. Run, don't walk away from this and save up your hard earned dollars for the real thing."
5,Star Trek Fan Heaven,"If you are a star trek fan of ALL of the series (TOS, NXT GEN, DS9, VOYAGER AND ENTERPRISE) then this collection is for you! It has the best of all of the 2 part episodes, the 2 hour premieres and the ""special episodes"". However it does-as an earlier reviewer commented-repeat 2 episodes (Trials and Tribbulations and Q-who) but frankly I didn't care. This collection is a wonderful gift for a fan who doesn't want to own all of the episodes from all of the shows yet enjoys all of the shows."
3,Product is just ok,There is nothing special about this product. It gives your face a reddish glow for a few hours and that is about it. I would rather use a basic mud mask or dead sea facial peel by Swisa that actually sluffs off dead skin or tightens up the pores if a mud mask. I doubt I would buy this again.
1,"Poor quality, bad service","This unit arrived with a bad battery that would not charge. When I contacted GE, I was told the the battery is not included on the warranty and I would have to purchase one on my own. I emphasized that this was an item purchased two days before my call, to no avail. GE told me I could return the item to Amazon.Also, during the call the customer service person told me we had a bad connection. I told her I was using the second handset of the system I was calling about. All she said was ""Oh"". The phone's voice quality is poor, static is high, and the speaker phone worse than than any cell phone I have used. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
1,GE Edge Cordless,"We've used VTech, Uniden, and AT&T; cordless phones in the past and have been satisfied. The GE Edge is truly awful. The two cordless phones had extremely poor reception... we could barely hear calling in and out. The phone attached to the answering machine was the only good one but who wants to be tethered to the base?Terrible product. We replaced it with a Uniden set."
2,GE Brings BAD Things to Life,"This phone was a bad choice. We've only had it a few months, and we're already having problems with it. The handsets don't transfer, so if you get a low battery beep in the middle of an important call, you're going to have to hang up and call back with the other handset. Then the answering system started hiding messages! Someone would leave a message, but it wouldn't show on the unit, and it wouldn't play until the next message came in. If it's several days later, you may have missed an important message. Then, even though you know it must be there, you have no way to access the new message until a new message comes in. Who knows what will go wrong next?! We can't take it back to the store, but we're going to replace it anyway -- this phone is just too unreliable!"
1,Static!!,"I bought this phone just last week and I have to say I am very disappointed. I have had cordless phones for a while now and this is the first one that I have had that is getting so much static, even though the base is less that 50 feet away from the handsets. I have the base in my bedroom and when I use the handset in my dining room, there is so much static that I can't hear the person on the line. Also one of the handsets did not ring until I switched cradles. Then I have been seeing strange messages on the handsets like ""line in use"" even though the other phones are seated in their cradles and off. Also the ring on the handsets is very low and I couldn't find any way (I read the manual) to raise the volume. Needless to say I am going to buy a different brand."
2,didn't last long,I have only had the telephone for 1 yr and it's no longer usable voice quality was always poor ans machine not loud enough to hear unless you are standing right next to it
5,Great Phone System!!,"Despite others who have had a lesser experience, I have found this phone system to work quite nicely in my home. For the price it has the function and features I was looking for in a cordless speakerphone with digital answerer (especially the speakerphone in the cordless handset as well as remote access to the answerer with same handset). I have even added an optional third handset (it can handle up to four). From my perspective this is a recommended product."
2,I cannot see the names on the caller id.,"The main phone is fine but,the handsets are very bad because I can't see the names on the caller id.When the phone rings,I have to run to the main phone to see who's calling and I hate that.I was going to send it back and request for a refund but I didn't do it. I wouldn't recommend this brand to anyone. Sorry."
3,Phones,"The main phone and one of the additional handseys operate well. However, one of the handsets does not show messages on its face ( the screen isn't operational). Amazon offered to return it for credit but I felt I would rather keep the poorly functioning handset rather than only having one additional handset since I can make and receive calls on the poorly functioning handset."
2,poorly constructed,"The hand set is hard to hold and also difficult to replace on corded base because of it's shape., The screen is hard to read. Very awkward"
1,Customer Service not up to par,"Had we read the previous reviews we may not have considered this phone system. Main corded phone had no dial tone, returned phone directly to manufacturer and they made us pay for returning the defective phone. Been 4 weeks so far and we have not gotten any replacement yet.Cannot rate the phone system itself since we have not been able to use it."
4,foghat and their heroes,"I have all of Foghat's music. They were a rocking band.This video shows them playing with their heroes.The color quality isn't the greatest,but it was shot in 1978 on film,however,the concert is great and I loved every minute of it. It shows a day in history that won't be repeated."
4,Foghat And Guests,"Not only does Foghat give props to all the great blues greats that appear on the DVD (Muddy Waters, Johnny Winter, Paul Butterfield, etc...) but they are having a blast playing with them. This is a great DVD for Foghat fans and fans of the blues."
3,A good show overall-not worth high price!,"I just got finished watching this show,and it's very good overall.Foghat,Johnny Winter,Muddy Waters,and Paul Butterfield are all standouts in this one,as are most of the other guests.The video and audio quality are alright for a straight transfer,but could have been much better if master tapes had been used to begin with.Another beef is with Johnny Winter's version of ""Last Night""-just about the time his solo gets cooking,it's cut short!Not too cool,IMHO.It appears that it has recently went out of print-don't pay more than $10 or $12 for this one,folks."
4,Startling oedipus,"It is many years since I read Sophocles' Oedipus. I found it then to be a most wonderful and exciting drama. more so than when I saw it on the stage. Reading this Ted Hughes' version of Seneca's Oedipus, I found the use of the english language to be overwhelmingly breathtaking, that the visual imagery conveyed by the words at times magnificently appropriately awful, and the story always gripping. Hughes used the words in relatively short phrases, like thoughts and fragments of thoughts but always with clear meaning. Recently performed in Melbourne, but unable to see it, I read a review of the performance, which prompted me to search for the book. It surpassed my expectations. A thoroughly good read.And the book was in good fair condition, as described."
5,great read for policy people,"I just finished a masters program in public policy, and though this book was not used in any of my classes, it was recommended reading. I have to say that it provides a great introduction to bureaucracies and why they are the way they are. (Spoiler: it's not, as many believe, because bureacrats are idiots) Coming from a background of small, private-sector organizations, this was especially useful for me.I appreciate Wilson's taxonomies of various organizations. Every political scientist has to have a 2x2 matrix to divide the world, but one of Wilson's, that divides organizations into ""production,"" ""coping,"" ""craft,"" and ""procedural"" is particularly useful. If you are planning a career in public service, you'd do well to take some time to match your personality to the type of organization you're thinking of joining."
5,A celebration of pagan spirituality and love,This book was the most wonderful book I have ever read. I keep a copy with me at all times. It pages are filled with love and knowledge and things that enrich my life. I could not imagine my life without it
5,A joy,"I bought this book for my mother-in-law as a gift, I read the sample online and was just tickled. The stories and personal connections are very empowering and I would recommend this book to anyone on a search for their own spirituality."
4,Lacks credible suspects,"This is a very very good legal/coutroom thriller. The scenes of Elinor Carlisles trial are excellent, and show yet another aspect of Christie's talent.However, this novels lacks one thing. Any credible suspects to choose from. (Apart from two.) As such, its a bit of a daft mystery. the other suspects only come into the readers orbit once or twice in the entire story, so we dont even really consider them.However, the plot construction is still good, the writing also, and the developement of the characters (especially Mary and Elinor) is very good. Poirots deductive powers are called to the fore once again. And even though there are so few real suspects, the solution manages to come as a bit of a surprise."
4,Reading with Tequila,"Why read: Reading all of Agatha Christie's mysteries.What impressed me: As per usual, Christie delivers an unexpected mystery that will keep readers guessing until the very end. I also liked that the romantic plot lines were relatable even today - a woman whose fiance leaves her for another woman, did she kill said other woman because of her broken heart?What disappointed me: Poirot wasn't involved until the very end of the case, when Elinor was already on trial. Elinor was also a tough character to believe in, simply because she kept her emotions so tightly under wraps.Recommended: Yes. Not as well known as Christie's more famous mysteries, Sad Cypress will definitely entertain."
2,Sad Cypress - Bad Ending,"Let me start by saying that I have read as many Agatha Christie books as I possibly could. Sad Cypress started out extremely well and held my interest throughout, providing wonderful insights to human nature and feelings, with a slew of possibilities for suspects. I couldn't put the book down! Why am I not recommending this book? The actual culprit was not just a surprise, but seemed to come out of nowhere and really had no connecting motive to the story. I think I would have given this book a rave review if I just didn't read the ending.Sorry."
3,The Delightful Hercule Poirot,"Elinor Carlisle, recently jilted by her fiancé, is strangely indifferent to the charge of poisoning the new object of his infatuation, Mary Gerrard. Having motive and means, Elinor's considered as good as hung by everyone in the village, with two notable exceptions: local doctor Peter Lord, himself in love with Elinor, and the famous detective Hercule Poirot, solicited by Lord to save her life.Poirot is a delightful character (though he doesn't feature here as much as I would have liked). Christie, not one for elaborate description, is quite good at revealing character through dialogue. Elinor is portrayed as a complicated--and, often, unlikeable--character, and I appreciated that. (I only wish Christie had applied a little more gray to Mary Gerrard, who comes off as very nearly angelic.)Some readers may find the plot a bit too contrived, as I did. I was also annoyed that an important clue is withheld from the reader for too long."
3,The biggest mystery is the title!,"This is Agatha Christie's only courtroom drama, and the mystery that unfolds is bracketed by scenes in court. She even presents evidence as if it were meant to appear in court, and Poirot is hired to help the defense prove that the one woman who could have committed the crime (or crimeS) in question didn't do it.The courtroom drama aspect of this novel isn't nearly as compelling as the mystery itself. Overall, it's not one of Christie's best, but loyal readers will still be kept guessing right up until the end. As for me, I am still guessing about what the heck the title could mean. The book offers no hint whatsoever, so any clues to THAT lingering mystery would be most welcome."
3,not one of Christie's best,"This one was just so so. Ending was somewhat predictable and a little far fetched. It did keep me engrossed for most of the book. Also, not all facts that could help solve crime are made known to the reader, which is a drawback for a whodunit."
1,Don't do it....Not worth it,NO WARRANTY my pzap plasma cutter didnt even work for 30 days no one at Pzap USA will even acknowledge my emails just NOT worth it
1,This is not the book you get,I was expecting this fantastic book and instead I get an out dated ugly pamplhet. I am very disappointed. Don't buy this if you think the book looks like the pic.
5,I Enjoyed It,I really enjoyed the book. Very interesting and adventurous. It was kind of hard to read but I got through it.
1,didn't read this book.,Was ordered in error. My granddaughter was showing me how to buy books and that's one she bought for me
3,An Oldie,"This book was not in my library when I was a child, but I knew of it. For me it has too many details and does not get down to the point as quickly as I would like. Of course I realize that at the time of this writing, many authors used many details leading up to the climax of the book. I would not read it again although I enjoy the movie."
3,An unenjoyable whale tale.,"It's been said that you will either love this book or hate it. Well, I fall pretty much under the ""hate"" camp.You will still see I gave it three stars. There are good parts about the book. Much like ""The Jungle"" let the reader know how horrific slaughterhouses once were, ""Moby Dick"" also very graphically describes the inhumanity of whaling in the 19th Century. For that it was really eye-opening.What I didn't like about the book was the extremely slow pace. It seemed like it was about 450 pages of unneeded blather. Maybe I'm just more used to the quicker pace and lack of subtext of most modern literature, but there were more than a few times I thought about just abandoning the book.Would I recommend to hardcore readers? Depends on what exactly you're into.Will I ever read this book again? Not likely. There are too many other things to read in however many years I have left."
4,can't access full table of contents,"i've never read it before, so i'm not sure how true to the original this version is. i do know that i am unable to access the full table of contents. i can only see chapters 1-9. but hey, it's free..."
4,Exaclty Almost The Same,I listened to the audio cds on this book and there are only a few different words. if you are going to buy this book. mine as well get the same thing for free!
2,Moby Dick,Very heavy reading as the language is quite archaic and very masculine and cruel themes. I'm determined to wade through it as I missed out reading it as a young person at high school. How it became such a well-known book is a bit of a puzzle as it is hard to imagine anyone really liking it.
3,Moby Dick Glad I Finally Read It,"After cheating in high school and using the cliffs notes I decided to read the book. It drags on like a bad cold and Melville is so overly descriptive and wasteful of the readers time that the book dragged on forever. Read the first middle and last chapter and be thankful that someone warned you. After all how many pages, and chapters does it take to describe the color white??"
4,Moby Dick,"Glad I read it as I had not don so previously, but it was tough to get through. Everyone should have the opportunity!"
1,Moby Dick,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! It just went on and on and ON! About rubbish! SOme old guy with one leg hunts down a white whale and in the end he kills the thing, but at the expense of his life and lives of his whole crew, except one guy....It may be liked by older people, but it really isn't for young people."
1,I flunked Moby Dick,"To be honest, I know this book is on a lot of 100-best-book lists of a lot of very smart, well read people. I just don't get it. I read it when I was quite young and I should probably give it another try - but I just can't force myself to do it when there are so many other great books I still haven't read and so many I want to re-read. Sorry, Herman. I do remember reading Typee and enjoying it. But my memories of Moby Dick are that it was turgid, plodding, and generally dispiriting."
2,Project Gutenberg is a better choice,"I don't know if it was dumb luck or what have you, but I just happened to be home when I got to Chapter 9 ""The Sermon"" on the Kindle when I pulled out my actual copy of the book to realize that the Sermon was missing. It was disappointing, but I'm learning to only get my classic books from Project Gutenberg where the books are, to my knowledge/experience, complete in their entirety. Another reason why I will always enjoy a hard copy book over e-reading. I just enjoy the portability of having my magazines, newspapers, and book all in one device too much to give it up."
4,Very good. Couldn't tell it was abridged.,"Moby Dick is Moby Dick. It's safe to assume you know what you're getting into as far as the book goes. This CD book had a very good narrator, and the abridged version was a good job. I'm guessing they probably chopped several hundred pages out of this to get it onto the 4 CDs."
2,Sections missing,"I really enjoy this book and was happy to see a free kindle version. I happened to notice however, that several paragraphs are missing in chapter 45. I only noticed because the writing skipped from one paragraph starting ""firstly"" to another paragraph starting ""thirdly"". Several paragraphs, including the second point, were missing! I hope I haven't missed too much, i think I will start checking my local bookstores for a print version of this book."
2,A classic but...,"I've read it twice now and it's still just okay. I understand the plot, the themes, and the subthemes. I just don't enjoy Melville's writing style. This particular edition gets only 2 stars because, as other reviewers have mentioned, parts of the book are missing."
5,Moby Dick,Great American classic. It is a must buy. Good for listening while driving long distances. It is a good clash of good and evil between Ahab and Moby Dick.
2,Follow The Leader,This was nice if you are an into the English language. I learned:That people will follow strong leaders into death for no reason.Racism is very comical.And More
1,A joke possibly?,Who needs a strategy guide for Tekken? All the moves are listed in the start menu. Hit start and select move list. Problem solved. I don't even know why they would make a guide for tekken.
5,"A fair price, a fair deal","I have heard that someone brought $.10 blackberry charger (With $4 to $5 shipping) in here and then the charger broke within 2 days after the purchase. Well, paying for $15 plus $4.5 shipping, at least this charger kit is still working fine after a month. The kit includes all chargers as description. I brought this kit to replace my lost, original charger."
5,Great series of books,"Bokobikes (Blue Nose Island)I first read one of these books at my son's pediatrician's office. I went home and ordered all three. They are so adorable, charming and clever. The art work is gorgeous. The stories hold our attention over and over, because there is nothing ""formula"" about them, these are very unique stories. I hope they make them into a movie."
3,commoners crown,"Little Sir Hugh and Long Lankin are vintage Steeleye. The instrumental Bach Goes To Limerick gets boring after a few listens. Dogs and Ferrets, and Weary Cutters are nice vocal numbers. Galtee Farmer is boring. Demon Lover isn`t bad. Elf Call is very disappointing, and sounds like nothing more than a pop song. New York Girls is okay, if you ignore the gratuitous Peter Sellers gibberish. What WERE they thinking! Overall, apart from the first two tracks I mentioned, the rest of the album is unremarkable."
4,"""Long Lankin'"" is Steeleye's ""Thick as a Brick""","Commoner's Crown, a halfway decent album, houses probably the best song that Steeleye Span ever did. That song is ""Long Lankin'"". I would compare this song to any of the best of Jethro Tull. This shows what Steeleye can and sometimes does do. ""Elf Call"" is farely good, kind of like their ""Thomas the Rhymer"". ""Little Sir Hugh"" is a journey, and to top it all off, ""New York Girls"" with Peter Sellers playing 'acoustic ukelele'. It is fun to listen to, but when you think about it, its pretty stupid. Over all, the album is just as good as something they would do back in 1971, which is very, very good."
2,Dry...,Book was very dry and the guys neo-con beliefs leak into the book in a way I found annoying enough to stop reading.
2,Natural History of Mickey Mouse,"McWhorter missed his calling in life. He should have been a stand up comic, or made his money answering pop culture trivia on gameshows. This book was in large part a disappointment...so much space is taken up by jokes, sitcom references, comic strip drawing style analysis, and banal leftist social commentary that I feel I'm owed [money]: I only got half the 'Natural History of Language' book that I paid for."
2,It is not a good source to learn about teaching strategies,"I was used to read it , but now i like the Linguistic the most.Most of techniques in Linguistic are awesome."
4,"Easy read, yet full of information","This book was a delight to read. The author went to lengths to make the reader feel at home about the subject matter at hand - language. He uses humor in places that bring his point home and he writes in such as way as to not scare off non-linguists. I was impressed with the plethora of information contained in so compact a book. I feel I travelled the word of language as I was reading. The only negative about the book are the countless actual examples of languages, paired together to show differences. I for one don't read more than 3 languages and found all the examples distracting; however, after a while, I simply skipped over them. The examples weren't missed though as the author makes his point without them. Overall, this book was insightful and interesting and a nice starting place for me."
4,Babel On,Excellent book for any linguist or student of foreign language. McWhorter captures the history of a multitude of languages and presents them in a context that is entertaining and easy to understand. Full of insight and interesting annecdotes on everyday language. Worth the read.
1,Waste of time,"There was a passing reference to ""the Puliyanese of South India"", which I sought to get more details about (being from South India myself) from the author, unsuccessfully. Perhaps interesting factoids can jump into a book without the hindrance of undue research, if they are .... say, exotic enough ?If a 10-year old wrote down everything he/she found interesting, in no particular order, would you buy it ? Me neither.That sums up my disappointment."
2,It is so John,"Oh John, language is not divocred from culture. Language helps to construct, register and appreciate culture. Language is and was developed as a social tool which allowed meaning to develop within a community. That is the foundation of a culture.And John the natural processes you document so well are facts. But the fact that language change exists in what you claim are static cultures; such as the tribes in the New Guinean highlands indicates simply that that either their culture too has developed down the years or that language changes regardless of culture. But regardless of the inherent flexibity of language, culture may also drive other changes in the language. The recent tendancy to nominalisation in English is an example."
2,So-so,"This oddly unsatisfactory book is well reviewed by Andrew Rasanen, who awards it 3 stars; if I give it 2 it is only because Mark Abley's superficially similar book The Prodigal Tongue is so much better. It came out in 2008 but has only garnered two reviews on Amazon (both 5 star by the way); what a shame."
2,A muddled mess,"Too many hands at writing, too many artists, too many titles crossing over together, and, ultimately, the grown-up YJers are dull, the de-aged JSA/JLAers annoying. If you like a series written by committee, this one is for you; if not, and you like YJ, look for one of the other (sadly few) collections."
4,"Without Arrowette, it's a little disappointing","Although this book was enjoyable, the abscence of my favorite character Arrowette (the girl archer) kept it from being an excellent graphic novel. It would have been great to have seen her as an adult. Her and Robin bring a little reality to these comics because they could exist in real life although such a pretty girl would probably want to be a supermodel instead. She is in the A League Of Their Own graphic novel which was a little better but just like this one they have to use a goofy artist in one of their stories which really looks odd compared to the majority of their art. Gen 13 also had this problem from time to time. Please stick with the original and best artists please."
2,Drawing all over the book,"Overall condition of the book was good, however upon reading there were MANY doodles in it, mostly of eyes and faces. Most of the time the drawing are over the words of the book making it very hard to read at times."
1,huh?,"i dont like having to reread pages because i have no idea what i just read. Organized HORRIBLY, seems as though there is almost no concise outline, uses overly complex and lengthy examples to explain simple concepts, and like said before extremely dry."
1,boring,This text is very dry which maks it hard to read. It does seem to be a great source of fact type information though.
1,Buyer Beware - This is a needle drop with bad crackles,"I'm not an audiofile but I would expect that if BGO was to use a needledrop they would use an vinyl album in mint condition. Unfortunately, they did not and there are crackles on the CD.It should have been disclosed that this was a needledrop especially given the prime price. It is a crime such brilliant music is treated with such little respect even given the late and great Dave Godin's liner notes."
4,Very good quality,"The product was the perfect length and seemingly had the right twist or bend to fit very well, but the collar was a bit too far from the flange at the exhaust manifold, so the nuts just made it on the lowest threads of the studs. I agree with the other guy about the sound---I didn't notice a difference in noise level. As an aside, I would recommend to anyone with only an intermediate level of auto mechanics, like myself, that they borrow a torch to heat the nuts at the manifold and use a 1/2 drive ratchet to remove them (15mm, 6 point socket used on my 02). The bolts and fasteners holding the opposite end can be cut or broken off---you'll need a gasket at this end, not up front."
4,A Cry In The Night,"A Cry In The Night ia abook of romance and full of mysteries, also brings fear that is terrifying to the characters of the book. Marry Higgins Clark is an author that includes every little detail as possible for the reader to visualize what is really going on in the minds of the characters. As a reader I was amazed and stunned by the shocking surprises that were unexpected. This book is one of the first books I've read by Marry Higgins Clark and I just couldn't put it down. I'am looking forward to keep reading another of her best selling books by this terrific author."
4,"""A Shot In The Dark""","This was my first Mary Higgins Clark read. What got me right from the start is how she wrote one of the last chapters first. It really got me into it right away. I call it a shot in the dark because the main character, Jenny goes out on a limb and falls in love with (and marries) a man she just met and gets swept into a world of weirdos and her life just gets swept upside down. It is quite exciting, and interesting complete with poisonings, thefts, kidnappings, and more. Quite a good read."
5,An Honest-To-Goodness Page Turner,"This story is great! I recently read this book and decided it was one of the best ever! Clark does an awesome job of developing characters. Erich, a wonderful gentleman, has many different sides to him, and the ending will definitly surprise you. It's so full of suspense that you can hardly read fast enough. I found myself reading it every moment I got, including the late hours of the night. The mysterious ways of the farm life makes you want to read it over and over just to see if maybe you missed something important that may explain why things are the way they are. It's kind of neat how all of the characters are related to each other in ways you never would have guessed. A wonderful book and definetly a must-read for those readers who love suspense and horror."
5,1st and definately not the last,"This was the first book I read by Mary Higging Clark and definately not the last. I have been searching for a good mystery, suspense, writer that could actually capture my attention and keep it. As soon as I started the book I could not put it down and actually read the bood in 2 days. This will definately not be the last book I read by her."
5,One of Mary's best! This book kept me up all night reading!,"Being still in Junior High, this book scared and mezmerized me!!! I was going though my mothers books and found one of Mary Higgins Clark's. I picked it up, went to my room, locked my door, and read late into the night. After that I just read and read many more of her books!! Right now, I am shopping for more and I will not stop untill I have everyone of her titles!!!!!"
5,Consuming,"This is definately one of Mary Higgins Clark's best. You find yourself excited by the turn of events when Jenny, down on her luck and fighting to make ends meet, finds herself marrying a wealthy, sensitive man. All of her dreams have come true but MHC artfully turns that dream into a nightmare. I couldn't put this book down. I would recommend any of MHC's books but I believe this is her best."
3,Eerie suspense.,Very good book. For my first Mary Higgins Clark read I would say I recommend it to other people * I like the ending and it surely kept my attention.
3,"It's just ""okay""","I'm not a huge Mary Higgins Clark fan, but I have enjoyed a few of her books. However, after reading people like Nora Roberts, Linda Howard, and Sandra Brown, this book seems quite ""empty"" to me. There's no real substance to it. Clark doesn't write characters that I want to read about, characters that I either love or hate. When I read, I like KNOWING the character, and seeing the story through their eyes. Here I don't know much about them at all. I know Clark writes mystery, not romance, but still, the whole relationship between the ""main"" character Jenny and the ""off"" Erich Kreuger is just strange, and hardly believable. It's hard to even pity Jenny for her situation. The idea of the story is a little spooky, I'll give her that, but it really didn't grab me. It's just another book that's easy enough to get through, but it's not so great."
2,"I'm a MH Clark fan, but....","I love Mary Higgins Clark, and have read all of her books. This one, however, has a dark quality that left me feeling eerie, not entertained. A book to avoid if you've been a victim of domestic abuse."
4,Seriously Spooky!,"MHC writes mostly suspense that really only get seriously frightening at the end. Not this one - its terrifying. This woman marries a man who turns out to be a maniac. The story of her and her two children is very scary. While not a book I would reread (too scary), it is definitely one to remember."
5,Exciting and Suspenseful Book,"I bought this book because it was on my school's summer reading list, so I didn't really expect much... boy, was I wrong! This book is an wonderful combination of mystery, suspense, and romance. Not being able to figure out the murderer until the last few pages, it will keep you on the edge of your seat and never want to put it down. I loved it so much that I went out and bought another book by Mary Higgens Clark. I strongly recomend this book to everyone. My best friend read it and also loved it."
4,a cry in the night,"Good easy read, this is a great book to read while going on vacation. I always enjoy reading one of my favorite authors."
4,A Cry in the Night,Totally riveting and real. Couldn't put it down until the last page. Writer has a real feel for painting a picture with words. Have always loved to read Mary Higgins Clark.
4,Circumstances are not always what you believe...,"Jenny MacPartland is a divorced mother of two who gets swept away by a brilliant artist, Erich Krueger and before she knows it is married and settled into his Montana life. Suddenly, things spiral out of control. Erich is not the man that she thought that he was. Jenny's ex-husband is murdered and she is the accused. Will she figure everything out before it is to late for herself and her childeren?This book is very suspenseful, a great quality of MHC. It is a little darker than most of her books, but still a thrill!"
4,A Cry In The Night,I personally enjoyed this book. An easy read that doesn't strain the brain but still allows you to become part of the characters involved. My only regret is that I tried to buy more of her work but there are only a few books of hers available on Amazon.
5,Her best Thriller,"I don't know how many times I read this book, but it must have been 5 or 6 times over the past 28 years since it has been published.Year after year I get MHC's new books and some of them are great, others are rather mediocre (I have to admit, I never cared for her Willy & Alvirah books). But except from Willy & Alvirah I hardly ever read a disappointing novel by MHC.""A Cry in the Night"" is a very suspenseful story with lots of atmosphere, very unpredictable (nobody can tell what's inside the cabin).Two previous reviewers compared the book with a Hitchcock movie and I very much agree to that.If you loved ""A Cry in the Night"", you will also enjoy ""Stillwatch"" by MHC.In the well-made TV movie based on this book, Carol Higgins Clark plays the main charcater, Perry King her husband Erich Krueger and I was delighted to discover famous French actress Annie Girardot in a supporting role.Book and film are both very recommendable!!!"
3,Chilling,"I'm not a huge fan of Mary Higgins Clark only because she is too predictable. However, this book I read years ago and it has never left the back of my mind. It is eerie, and down right scary to think that you never really can know everything about a person until you live with them, and then you just may not want to. If you are a single woman looking to find the man of your dreams, read this book only to know what to beware of.I actually had a really hard time reading this only because it creeped me out so much. If you like a good thriller, than this one is for you. There is no guessing to who the bad guy is. You can only wonder if she gets away before it is too late."
5,A GREAT BOOK,THIS BOOK WAS INVIGORATING I MEAN IT STARTS OUT SLOW AND THEN THE BIG BOOMYOU JUST GET BLOWN AWAY A GREAT BOOK
1,great book if you enjoy the gratuitous killing of animals,"I may have read one or two of her books in the past, but I won't be in a hurry to pick up another one. Besides the two instances where an animal was cruelly and unnecessarily killed, I could see the predictable, happily-ever-after ending coming a mile away."
2,Disappointing,"If you have never before read a May Higgins Clark novel, I can see raving about this book. However, as a big Mary Higgin Clark fan, I found 'A Cry in the Night' disappointing. Personally, I am used to the books of MHC usually having plots twists and endings that are complete surprises. While this book did have one twist, the ending seemed obvious, and I grew anoyed with Jennie, the novel's protagonist. She was not the typical proactive heroine of a Higgins Clark book, who you cheer on as they unearth the truth.If this is your first May Higgins Clark book, enjoy- you probably will find it eerie and riveting- but if it's not I wouldn't bother."
1,Not as expected,"The description stated like new...it was not. Cover was extremely yello dirty, inside extremely yello. Threw out the book. Will never order from this vendor again."
4,A cry in the night,I previously read nearly all of Mary Higgins Clark's work. I had taken a break from her more recent work and was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed A Cry in the Night. It was suspenseful and entertaining. I great read for fall!
3,Somewhat Dark Entertainment,"This is my first Mary Higgins Clark novel, and I must say, I was quite entertained to a certain degree. What kinda left me wondering about this main character, Jenny is, why she would just let someone, I don't care if it is her husband, (who I think she married too soon without getting to know him better)take her own precious daughters off into oblivion without phoning the police first. Seems she should have sensed this was a nut case from the beginning! I just found this concept utterly RIDICULOUS!! Get REAL! But despite the rought edges,I'm glad what happened at the end."
4,Mary Higgins Clark is a Master Writer,I read this Book for recomendation from a friend of mine that live i Seatlle-WA. She read it and she was enchanted like Mary Higgins describes the scene. I noticed the way Mary Higgins get our attention during all the time. It's mien that we are in the story. I intend to read the others Higgins's books.
2,Mary's own life,"As a longtime fan of hers, I read this book but did not enjoy it much, as it seemed like she was trying something odd and new, completely alien geo. territory, strange characters. If you look at an older copy of this, like a library copy, you see in the earlier editions she dedicated it to her SECOND husband, and at that time she LIVED in Minnesota! Apparently that marriage was brief and unhappy, she returned to the NY/NJ area where she now lives and remarried a few years ago to her current husband. there has never been any reference to the 2nd marriage or to her life in Minn. again."
5,The Dresden Dolls are a revelation,"This album, and band, reminded me of Nine Inch Nails, Pink Floyd (especially Roger Waters' compositions from The Wall), and Ben Folds Five. However, whereas those bands are comprised of males, The Dresden Dolls is female-driven. This is one of the most impressive and original albums of the decade."
4,Be Adventurous,"Dismiss any preconceived notions based on the name of the band or the album artwork. This is not mindless pop, nor is it melodrama and ""woe is me"" ramblings. This is brilliantly conceived and executed music, lyrically intricate and musically challenging. Think Kander & Ebb's ""Cabaret"" score meets post-punk pop."
5,definatly 5 stars!!,wow.........i cant even describe the lyrics. i hate punk/goth/rock but these guys are soooooooo good. the lead singer had a very good voice but i seriously cannot get over the lyrics. i am a fan of rap and country but this definatly makes it on my list! if you are a fan of anything you will absolutly love this album. it took me a little time to warm up to all there songs but girl anachronism is a masterpiece!!!get this album this second!!!! buy it online...go to bst buy or whatever but definatly get this!!
4,Some music with a kick,"This CD is unlike any other. The music style is very unique and catchy. It might not be your favorite as soon as you listen to it...but give it a bit and you will find yourself with the tune in your head before long. Also, look for the videos on the net because they are quite funny."
1,Eh...,"I have been hearing about this band for the past few months, and was actually going to go to their show when they came here to Chicago. Well, lets say I am glad I didn't. Don't get me wrong, I love ecentric music, and cross genre sounds, but this is just, yuck. I am surprised they are now getting mainstream attention, as I can't even swallow this, and I listen to some pretty abstract music. Not to compare the two musically, but if William Hung can sell, I suppose any band can now. Oh, and in response to the reviewer below me, just because they have their faces painted up like mimes, doesn't make them ""Goth Rock"", I hear no influence of said genre at all, cabaret piano mixed with punk rock drums gone very wrong...."
4,Almost Amazing,"The Dresden Dolls capture everything you would ever want in a great CD. They've got excellent dynamics going from soft (almost too soft at times) to very loud and full of emotion. They have twisted subjects. But, beware that if you buy this CD you are getting one heck of a lot of swear words. If you don't want to hear the F word, stay away from this. If you're okay with the swearing, then it's one of the best CDs you'll ever own. Just be aware of the amount of swearing"
5,Fun-Tastic,"I love this CD. Some of the songs are down right creppy. ""Half-Jack"" brings up an intersting question. ""Coin Operated Boy"" is a fun account of girl's dream. All i can say is this band is going to be BIG, certainly worth every penny"
5,Wow...really fresh and a wonderful addition to my collection,"Another semi-random buy.I found the website while searching for another group, and I watched the video for ""Girl Anachronism"" and I was just kinda like, ""Wow, this is really new and unique!""Armed with only a piano, drums and Amanda Palmer's beautiful vocals, you have ""The Dresden Dolls"".Some of their songs bleed with their eccentricism, and satire.If you enjoy new, strange music, I'd pick this up. The whole album kind of sounds like it's straight out of a broadway show. I could really see them making a musical to all these songs. That's what it sounds like. Cabaret-ish. Amazing stuff.Definitely worth the money.Pick it up today! Yes yes yes!"
2,Disappointed,"I owned ""My Feet Are Smiling"" in vinyl from the 70's and thought I'd get a summary of a great artist's life work here. Not so much. Aside from most of the stuff from the album I already owned, there is a bunch of stuff on this that featured a lot of other instruments intruding on Kotke's guitar work to the extent that it no longer is his work. It totally ruins his artistry. Some of the pieces are actually painful to listen to. There is one that is actually mostly studio background noise. I hate to see that someone talked him out of performing solo and convinced him he needed other musicians to accompany him. DRUMS??? YECH!"
5,Rare Laserdiscs - dvds Movies Collector.,"Suhaag is Another Amitabh,Shashi greatest Movie,I grew Up watching this great movie,I have it on dvd,'tis a Must See !"
4,An important book by the expert on this subject,"Roger Goodman, a lecturer in anthropology at St. Antony's College, Oxford, is the principal expert writing in English on children in Japan.Goodman admirably documents the emergence of the kikokushijo in the social, cultural, and economic dynamics of post-war Japan. It is a fascinating story and it is apparent that Goodman has reviewed an impressive body of literature. It marks an excellent contribution not only to the field of Japanese studies but also to anthropology with its increasing interest in areas of urban modernization and industrialized capitalism.See also Goodman's most recent book, 'Children of the Japanese State', an attractive book also published by OUP, which looks at Japanese children raised by state institutions in Japan, and will clearly be the definitive work on the subject."
1,Science it is not,"The first red flag - ""About the author"" at the top of this page. Beware of the authors advertised by the major media outlets.Among other nonsense, this book promotes a failed AA 12-step approach and other myths such as marijuana being a gateway drug. Do yourself a favor and do some serious research instead of wasting your time here. Pathetic and laughable."
4,works well,"Bought this in July 2011. This fits well and secure, a bit bulky. Beware of other similar brand, that is not as sturdy. The pictures look the same, but it's different in material."
2,Waste,"Don't waste your time with this belt, it won't stay in place. Slides around way to much, straps are not comfortable."
3,belt,Product was ok but the size should be be adjusted I orderd a small and that was a little to big {I have a 32 waist]if I had orderd what they suggested it would have been to big
2,The size chart is a joke. Read the reviews.,"Everybody is right about the size chart. I bought this for my mother who is in great pain from her hernia, but now we need to have a replacement sent to us.It's good that the company is replacing the item. However, they want you (the customer) to pay the return shipping + they charge $7.00 for the restocking fee. So now this ""$30.00"" item has become a $47.00 item that is taking 3-4 times longer to receive, which is resulting in the user waiting in pain until the company ""fixes"" the issue with a product that they market at sizes fit for Shrek and Fiona."
4,pretty good,i got the job done for me at the gym but it takes some time to get use to wearing it but overall a pretty good buy
2,Hernia Belt,"Poor construction. Had to sew it twice in 2 different areas. Now it's tearing in a third area. Considered returning it but he refund conditions were sketchy at best. Partial refund, restocking fee ect.. Just decided to keep and repair it. Currently looking for a better product that holds up to daily wear. I would not recommend this belt to anyone. All I do is spend most of my time repairing it with thread and needle. Very dissatisfied. Would have given it one star but since I am still wearing it all patched up, gave it two stars."
5,A suggestion for using this hernia belt,"This Soft Form Hernia Belt has worked very well for me, but I have a suggestion for its use which may be helpful to others who have it.I found that when wearing it with standard ""brief"" syle underwear, with the belt adjusted to provide adequate pressure on the hernia, the genital area was uncomfortably compressed and the straps were rubbing on the inside of my legs.By changing to Jockey Brand Boxer/Brief style both of those problems were eliminated. The slightly longer legs on the Boxer/Brief places underwear material between my legs and the belt straps, and provides a looser pouch for genital comfort.I like this Soft Form Belt well enough to order another one if I find I need to wear it more often and/or for longer periods."
3,These many stars ONLY after having to figure several things out over a period of about a week...,"I have two good things to say about this product: 1) After making adjustments to my use of it--based on MY EXPERIENCE, not a user guide, it helped me for as much as the eight or so hours at a time I sometimes wore it and for shorter amounts at other times. Luckily I don't have to go to work every day or bend and stretch a lot or do strenuous things otherwise. 2) I'm having inguinal hernia surgery three days from now, and won't have to wear it again (I hope).From experience I learned: 1) To remove it before sitting down to lean over to take of my shoes--or to put my shoes on; 2) To wear a SECOND pair of undershorts over it to help keep it from sliding down and loosening up; 3) To not button the top of my pants when I'm wearing it, or tighten my belt too firmly because that forced it down eventually, especially when I was walking.By the way, I did order the correct size."
3,Hernia belt,"This item is fairly comfortable, but like most others, it seems to get out of place easily and rides down. Now I see why women's girdles are so unpopular. Of course it doesn't help having a somewhat large stomach to contend with. I wonder if a good form fitting jock strap might help. I plan to get surgery to fix the problem in the meantime this will be used when needed. I try best not to need it."
5,Nitty Gritty Pre-Country Dirt,"This is my favorite NGDB album 'cause it's fresh, original, and there was nothing else like it when it came out in '67. I know 'cause I was there. A bunch of friends and I, who were in college at the time, loved to listen to this one, especially when we were feeling really good. Listening to it today brings a flood of memories about those good times. The Teddy Bears' Picnic is a real grabber, but the rest of the songs are good too, demonstrating musical virtuousity and the guts to be different. It's definitely not for the country music set - it's trippy and nostalgic. If you can listen to it without smiling, get thee to a shrink!"
5,ann frank,my daugjhter found this movie very good she needed it for school and she passed so that made her very happy if any child needs this i say bye itcharlene
4,Where is the Intermission?,"A fine DVD representation of this great film. Good special features as well. While ALfred Newman's pre-title Overture and Exit music is presented, the Intermission music has been removed. The cut intermission insults the original presentation. My only reason for 4 stars rather than 5."
4,what the rasism took on the nazi term,"I saw the movie and I thought the book and the actors were very good. They made the people smile all the time even though they were in difficult time. This video is so sad because it shows signs what happenend during the time they were in the hiding place.All scenes were dramatic for them. I felt sad at the end when Mr.Frank returned home without his family because all of them had died.I recommend it, not only once, but all the times remenber what the history was for the Jews people."
5,A VERY Good Movie.,"This movie really was something. Okay, well the only reason I wanted to see this movie is because Richard Beymer is in it. But I appreciate it far more than I think I ever would. World War II amazes me...the worst war ever fought; millions of people murdered. It's awful to think how terrifying those times were. Especially in this movie, the scenes when the two families have to be so quiet that they can hardly breathe make me think, would I really be able to do this? Or when they watch almost all of Holland be blown up to pieces from their attic window, it really makes you wonder how they could survive so long. These two families had such courage, such hope, and even more faith. The actors and actresses who portrayed these people were magnificent; I can't put it into words. I really appreciate this movie. So much in fact that I would watch it a million times and still appreciate it as I did when I first watched it."
4,this movie was very interesting,DATE 05/31/2000 the Diary of a young girl Anne frank I want to talk a lato bate about this book for me this book is very interesting special Anne went I wath the movie I saw the movie is interesting and sad also the interesting side is.she was a smart girl she want to became a woman but she like talk to much she like liberty she dont want to stay room evrey day and she like dance she wanted a boy friend she was loney she wrote storie hse have many think for me she was a great girl and she was rebellions girl she neds atention and affection she is longing for peter that's interesting side the side sad is the cant go aout side they have to stay inside they cant talk loud they cant listen the radio they have to keep silence is very sad I cant live like that is to hot to live like that. that a sad side for conclution I like this book I like the movie is very interesting I want an be a diary man like her thank you
4,impossible experience is enthralling,"When I saw this 1959 production recently, I was as enthralled as I was years ago. This time, however, it was not Shelly Winters or Lou Jacobi who impressed me, but Joseph Schildkraut, who's portrayal of Otto Frank makes the entire film plausable. His iron will along with Anne's love of life, hold the group together. This film still holds viewers interest today, despite the heavy handed used of violins marking the most poignant moments."
5,book worm,"The books we ardered were in great shape, My daughter loves to read and if we need a book we get on Amazon and it is there>"
3,It's not enough to show us about the war in the movie.,"About 15 years ago, I watched this movie. Then it was so boring to watch the end of movie, because I couldn't understand it at all. Now I watched it again. Then I got what's going in the story. There are two stories which are a young couple's love story and about the World War II in the movie. And this movie is old and it is in black and white. Those actors and actresses are not enough to make up the story. But it is enough to show us how horrible, miserable and tough life it is in a secret place. So we must think what happened during the war and we should wake up for the innocence people. And I thought about my experience watching the movie. It was about 15 hours flying by the plane. I was almost getting crazy in there because it was stuck and couldn't go out. I really wanted to get out of there. But I couldn't because you know the life. I'm so sorry this happened in the world. People- we should think about it!"
4,The Diary of Anne Frank,"This is a fine story. It is a sad story, but true to the happenings of the day. As a young Jewish girl, she deserves to be heard."
4,"A very sad movie, that I never forget.","The movie is based on the real life The Diary of Anne Frank. Seeing how eight people remain hiding in a Secret Annex for such a long time, and not able to make any noise, made me feel very troubled. Seeing how the Jewish people were made to take the walk of death, because they were of a different race, clearly shows the ignorance of man. I have always been interested in Anne Frank, and I think the movie intensified it. I really appreciate this movie. I would recommend everyone should see it. It could help us to see the suffering of others."
4,A little disappointed,"At the end of the movie--about 10 minutes to go, it froze...stopped for about 30 seconds...and then played. I did miss a part of the movie. I was worried that the ending wouldn't be shown,,,but it was. Was I disappointed? A little. But thankful that the movie did finish okay."
3,"It's Okay, But It Doesn't Do the Play Justice","""The Diary of Anne Frank,"" as directed by George Stevens, is certainly not a bad movie. However, it seems to lack the certain spark, sincerity, and tight acting of a truly great movie, and come to think of it, the play on which it is based. The movie is hurt severely by Millie Perkin's, who is whiney and lifeless as Anne Frank. Of all the worthy talent out there, why did they have to pick someone who was not only bad, but 10 years to old for the part. Ed Wynn is dreadfully miscast as grumpy dentist Dussel, and the whole movie is dragged on for so long that the ending is anticlimatic. On the positive side, Joseph Schildkraut and Lou Jacobi recreate the roles they held on Broadway with sincerity and gusto, and Shelly Winters won an Oscar for her delightful performence as Mrs. Van Daan. The screanplay by Albert Hacket and Francis Goodrich is also quite moving. Not a bad showing, but Stevens could have done better."
5,My students loved it!,"I purchased this dvd after seeing the VHS that was available at my school's media center. It was a huge hit with my students and the picture quality was tremendously better! Since I do not have a vcr in my classroom, it had been a big hassle to reserve the tv/vcr cart and plan to get it into the room. The dvd made it possible for me to pop it into my computer and show it through my projector! I viewed the extra footage and interviews myself and found them fascinating. I have not shown the extras to my students as I am not sure that 8th graders are ready for the graphic reality of the bodies piled up at the concentration camps. This dvd made if much easier to locate the scene where each class had left off the day before. I love it and my students were totally thrilled with it!"
5,"Moving Version, Cast, Lens and Score Witness","Cinemascope in an attic. Powerful cast. Classic score. Dedicated Direction. Subject matter beyond thought, but Stevens makes it entertaining and that should allure you to a darker reality not to be forgotten."
3,The Diary of Anne Frank,"This is the original film, circa 1959. It closely follows the play. It's a bit cold and rigid, with the actors delivering their lines stiffly. I was especially interested in Otto Frank since I was recently cast in that part for the theatre version. I found Ben Kingsley's version in the remake of the late 90's to be much more real, but I'm glad I watched this version too."
3,Anne Frank,A little longer than expected. Using it in a school setting so length is an issue. Students did enjoy the content.
3,"At best, a diversion","Most of my students (8th/9th) said this book was ""fair."" It starts out satisfying, but loses energy toward the end. It's enjoyable, but there are other more exciting books out there. And WHY it was a Newberry Honor book, we can't tell."
3,authenticity?,"I did not read all ... reviews so perhaps my questions about the books have already been discussed. I enjoyed the book thoroughly, but question that there were pine trees and fireflies in the southwestern region of Washington state -ever. Neither is indigenous to the area. Also, at the end of the story, the author mentions daffodils and crocus blooming. In 1899, most big families in the region were not buying and planting such exotic bulbs when there were so many mouths to feed! There are plenty of native flowers which bloom in the spring that would define the moment with accuracy. I hope Jennifer can answer this posting. Perhaps a new edition of the book could correct these obvious errors?Tina"
1,Don't read and especially don't buy - not historical fiction,"In my current role as a volunteer tutor for 5th graders, we are reading this trash. As a Washingtonian I am insulted because it is obvious that the author has never set foot in Washington. Almost every detail is wrong from the presence of fireflies [never] to the presence of ice on the lower Columbia River. If you know nothing about Finns or about the PNW you will get the wrong impression; if you do, you will like we do, feel offended. Or maybe you'd be interested in finding how many details an intelligent reader can find that are incorrect - a contest as it were - there is no other reason for reading this garbage."
3,It's ok...,"I had to read this book for school and didn't find it very interesting. I mean, it was ok, but not my type of book. this is for people who like wilderness stories and such. But check it out anyway, maybe you'll like it. To me, it wasn't very interesting and and I never really finished it. One thing I liked about it though, were the surprises. That makes the book sort of worth it. Well anyways, check it out!!!"
1,Present Tense is Nonsense,"Publishers and booksellers should warn readers when an author employs that irritating device of writing in the present tense. I read the first paragraph and gave it to an 11 yr old girl. She read the first chapter and gave it back, telling me to give it to the library."
5,love it!!,"I think this book is really fantastic for the people who enjoy reading about families because May Amelia Jackson is the only girl born on the Nasel river in washington. Most of th time she forgets that she's a girl because she goes fishing with her seven older brothers and wears overalls! Her dad doesn't really like girls that much because he thinks they to be careful with things. Suddenly, when the family finds out mother has a baby, May's father hopes it would be a boy because he can't handle another May Amelia. But May Amelia hopes for a little sister to play with."
1,this is a boring book,Hi well to start This is a very boring book. I can't believe it got a newberry cause it really stinks bad. And well it was fun at first but there wasn't good grammer or punctuation. (I enjoyed that part.) But it was boring (as I've said before.) But May got treated bad by her Dad and brother and a bunch of other stuff happened. I didn't finish it cause I didn't like it. Well gotta go hope this was helpful Brooke.
3,Pretty blasé.,"""Our Only May Amelia"" is the third book I've read by author Jennifer L. Holm, and I enjoyed her ""Boston Jane"" series more. It took me a while to get used to the style of writing Holm employed, since there are no quotation marks - so you'll have to figure out when people are talking - and random capitalization of words May Amelia found important. After reading this story, I tried to figure out the point, or even plot. I came to the conclusion that this story is just about the life of a Finnish girl - the only daughter in a family. I ""sorta"" recommend."
1,Our Only May Amelia,"As a well-read parent reviewing literature for my pre-adolescent children, I must say I was sincerely disappointed. I found the story lacking in continuity of thought and constantly jumping around between different events. There is also some harsh language and a horribly cruel grandmother who could be frightening to children. Some of May's adventures were interesting, such as hunting for a murderer and getting chased up a tree by a bear and nearly drowning in the Nasel river. I felt that the characters lacked the warmth that draws you in and makes you feel as if you're living the adventures yourself. I found it overall quite shallow and definitely lacking the necesarry components to qualify as a classic work of American Literature."
4,I was surprised!,"I always have a read-aloud in progress with my 7th grade language arts classes, and my sole purpose is that we will enjoy some good books together. No pressure. No grades. After four books with male protagonists, I decided on May Amelia as a female protagonist who the boys in my classes could put up with whether they liked her or not. The boys' reactions were surprisingly positive, and the girls loved the book. Undoubtedly, May's tomboy ways contributed to this, but the boys were also touched by the strong emotion in the book. It was sometimes difficult to read this book alound due to the lack of quotation marks, and I found it helpful to read each chapter to myself before reading it aloud. Overall, I found that my students enjoyed the book more than I expected they would. The afterward about the author's family prompted good discussion."
5,Our only May Amelia Review,I thought that this book was very good! I wanted to keep on reading after every chapter and couldn't bare to put it down! I finished it in 3 days! It was like Holes in the sense that you liked it but you didn't know why. I find this girl like me because she is a tom boy and loves adventure! I would definately recomend this book!
5,A Must Read,"Our Only May Amelia is about May Amelia Jackson, the only girl on the Nasel and in her family. A Real Miracle, says her family. But May doesn't always like being a miracle, like when her father doesn't let May take the boat out alone because she's a girl. What May thinks will be a real miracle is if the baby her mother is going to have is a girl!"
5,Interesting and Spunky,"This book is really great. The characters are well developed, the storyline is twisted and unpredictable, albeit sad. It really shows the heart of a girl that is surrounded completely by men and boys, and therefore thinks like them, and how she struggles both to become and avoid becoming a Proper Young Lady.The grammar is bad, but that only adds to the charm and realistic approach to an acoount written by a Finnish immigrant. I think that this book is worth the time and money."
5,from one who grew up in naselle,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was well written and captivating.I went back through the years to my childhood through the eyes of May Amelia. I identified much with her tough independent spirit which shines through the pages.Thank you Jennifer Holm for helping me remember!!!
4,Up and Up book,"This book is an extrodinary book! once it seems that it cant go any farther it does! it kept me up and down out of my seat. (most likly up u know what I mean) I would recomend this book to many people around the world. Even if you dont care about the Nasel (were May amelia lives) jeeeezzz! you must have been mistaken! you learn many fantastic things, including what its like being the only girl around."
4,May Amelia is Cool,"This is an excellent book...I read it when I was in 4th grade and I enjoyed it a lot! The only thing I dont like is that it doesn't have quotation marks and it is hard to tell when someone is talking. Otherwise, it is a good book about a 12 year old girl who has 7 brohters (Including Kaalo, a cousin). She goes on adventures and it is really exciting!"
3,A review of a good book by Katie,"Our Only May Amelia is about a girl (the first ever born on the Nasel River) who really if anything is more like a boy. She is the only girl in her family, she has 7 brothers and a baby on the way. The family lives on a farm on the bank of the Nasel River in Washington Sate. Her problem is her being the only girl on the farm. She belives that her father favors her brothers over her. She has many adventures in the course of the book such as going to visit her aunt in Astoria, her mother having a baby, 2 deaths in the family, one of her brothers getting ""shanghaied"" (or does he?), another one of her brothers almost died, and almost being killed in the Nasel. At the end of the book May Amelia realizes that she is a real treasure to her family and that as harsh as her father can be deep down inside he really love her!"
1,Rather Dull,"I can't believe this was a Newbery Honor book. Pickin's must've been slim that year. The first half of this book is dull, just ordinary information about the character's life. It's not until about half way through that there's any kind of conflict--a bit too long to wait. But the second half of the book isn't much better than the first. And the ending was lacking. The characters in the book spoke using no contractions, which I found odd. I don't know anyone who speaks without using contractions. I don't think they even did that back in 1900. It made reading the dialogue somewhat ackward. I notice that other children's writers do this too. But I don't understand why. This book has a lot in common with Boston Jane. Both characters are tomboys, they spit, the Chinook Indians, and there's even a character in this book by the name of Jane. I liked the Boston Jane series, but not this book. i just though it was a bit dull."
2,I Didn't Like This Book,"This book was so dumb I can't believe it won a Newbery Medal. For example, Every Word In A Sentence Is Capitalized. And, there are no quotation marks, so you can't tell whether they are talking or not. Plus, why is Kaarlo so mean to May? I think Jennifer Holm should read something like ""The Hobbit"" by J. R. R. Tolkien or ""Absolutely Normal Chaos"" by Sharon Creech or ""The Westing Game"" by Ellen Raskin. There are a lot of books out there that are good so don't buy this book."
3,it was O.K.,"i read this book a while ago,but i just now decided to review it.to sum it up it was fine,but it really doesn't have that zing that makes a memorable book.it was kind of neat because i live like a half hour away from astoria,but the book could have been alot better if it wouldn't have been so . . .well,choppy.read it,by all means,but don't save a space on your bookshelve."
2,LA Praire,Thsi was too expensive and didn't do much I would say Patricia Wexler is better for the money.
4,Roxette is back!,"I received this album in the mail in Mid-March. My first listening of the album was not so well taken. I wasn't expecting the wide variety of music that Per and Marie had lined up on this album. Still not best to date, HAND has a few catchy tunes that I think would be more popular if the order of single release was different. According to the Roxette fan club website, ""Wish I Could Fly"", the first single, has not topped the charts in a lot of countries. Unfortunately, living in the United States, I personally don't think that as a first release would fare well here. Perhaps, ""Stars"" would be an apt choice to say ""Hey, we're back and enjoy us!!!"". We will leave it up to EMI America to decide what to do. I love Roxette, don't get me wrong. If you are anything like me, and love to see your favorite artists go far, they should reconsider the line up of singles. Over all, HAND is great, but not the best."
4,Roxette's Finest Album Overall,"This is the BEST album Roxette released. Dance-floor worthy ""Crush On You"", fantastic first single ""Wish I Could Fly"" and 60's inspired ""Waiting For The Rain"" being the true standouts. The entire album failed to get a US deal -- not a huge shock considering the duo's last charting single was ""Sleeping In My Car"" (#50) in 1994 -- which is unfortunate since this album is strong on sound. Roxette was never a group for deep and meaningful lyrics, but that is totally irrevelant. ""Wish I Could Fly"" got some minor US play when it was included on ""Don't Bore Us, Get To The Chorus"", issued through lesser-known label Edel America Records. An absolute must for EuroPop fans."
4,hidden treasure,"I bought this album for my wife, but i like it too. I think she has some of the best pipes around. This album is very smooth and has a great production sound to it. If youre a fan of roxette this is one to buy for sure."
4,Simple and does the job,My 2 year old loves to paint and this does a great job of protecting him. He still can get paint on him but it does a nice job of helping and he likes to put it on.
5,my little artist,I purchased the smock for my 5 year old who likes to paint and he loves it. I think its a great buy and definitely got my money's worth.
4,Chair Saver,The purchase was a spur of the moment thing while I was making another purchase and I decided to look for the product because I had seen it in a catalog along with the item I was looking for. I am so far satisfied with it and may purchase another in the future.
3,"Nothing special, just o.k.","Mildly interesting historical mystery. Nothing really wrong with it, just nothing to really connect me with the characters and make me want more. I will read more of the series if I run out of more interesting things to read."
3,"Meh. Didn't love it, didn't hate it.","After a slow start, I suppose I got interested in Makepeace and her blended family of brother, rescued Huron, and Betty and her son, but the slow start did have me skipping ahead and coming back to the narrative, which is an unfortunate way to read a book. I also found the different dialects and ""accents"" as transcribed to be a little painful to unravel in my head. Still, the novel is well-plotted and the characters are fairly fully drawn, which is always nice. I adored Ariana Franklin's books, so I'll give the next Makepeace adventure a try, as well."
4,Great Romance!,"This book was a fast read and very good. The heroin was strong and the conflict was very interesting. I had a tough part with the end of the second section but the third section dealt the justice needed in order to make the book grand. If I had a single criticism, it would be that the ending could have been a little more conclusive...or a bit less ""and they lived happily ever after"" and a little more of a conclusive resolution to the conflicting personal relationships in the heroin's life. Great read...especially for you romantic saps."
2,Not what I expected,"While I cannot say that I hated this book overall, I certainly did not like it as well as I thought I would. If you are looking for a historical romance novel with a happy ending, this is probably not your cup of tea. It's actually kind of a depressing story.Also, the writing was difficult to follow at times. At various points throughout the book, without any indication, the author jumps to another conversation or goings-on. The reader has to stop a minute and try to figure out who is now talking and the setting of the new scene.Finally, while I am a rather well-read person with an interest in learning new words, this book just got annoying. The use of obscure words several times per page--while perhaps appropriate for era--distracts the reader, not allowing them to fully grasp the meaning of what the writer is trying to convey.Overall, while I was captivate by the first third of the book and still interested the second third, this book is certainly not one I will read again."
3,Could have been better,"Maybe my expectations were too high. This book was entertaining, and written from an interesting perspective. The story itself had a lot of potential for being great...but it was not great.I wouldn't consider this a romance. It's not so much about the love story of the main character as it is about how the things that happen to her change her. If you're looking for a really moving love story, you'll be disappointed.""A Catch of Consequence"" was certainly worth reading, but based on other reviews, and the summary of the story, I was just expecting something with a little more substance.So, don't expect the artistry of Diana Gabaldon, but read it anyway."
3,"Disapointing, but still good","Toby Kieth is one of my favorite country singers, but I was mildly disapointed by this CD. ""Honkytonk University"" and ""As Good As I Once Was"" are the only two solid songs on this CD. That being said, the CD is still worth buying and is definantly a more 'normal' country CD than his others. I'll stick with ""Unleashed"" as his best, though."
1,Yuck!,I listened to this when I first got it and it didn't grab me but I figured I just needed to listen a few more times and get used to it. I forced myself to listen to it again and promptly filed it under money-not-well-spent.
5,A WHOLE NEW TOBY,"For a long time Toby Keith has enjoyed a reputation of being one of Country Music's ""Bad Boys"" or a slam-bam Country Rocker. Some of his earlier offerings such as ""Who's Your Daddy,"" ""How Do You Like Me Now?"" and ""Beer for My Horses"" are indicative of this reputation.But with HONKYTONK UNIVERSITY we see a whole new Toby. Yes there are the signature songs here like ""Honky Tonk U"" and, to a degree, ""As Good As I Once Was."" But then the album shines with several of the most beautiful, heartfelt Western ballads that I have ever heard. Keith offers a mature, mellow side with ""Your Smile,"" ""Where You Gonna Go?"" and, my album favorite, ""I Got It Bad."" But then every track on this one will have you enjoying the sound and recognizing Toby Keith's versatility as one of the best Country Stars extant. This one's definitely a keeper.THE HORSEMAN"
5,Big Heart,"I've been a Toby fan for a long time. In fact, my first country albums I ever bought was Boomtown. To this day this remains my favorite Toby album and this new one reminds me of that. Toby puts a lot of heart and feeling into this one. Vocally this is his best one too. You Caught me at a Bad Time and Your Smile gave me chills. I love everything that Toby does but this one is something special. It is really something different from his last couple albums but I don't think you'll be disapointed.Side note - Is it just me or is Toby looking better and better as time goes on? He is Hot! :)"
3,"I love Toby, but not Honkytonk U.","I don't think any song by Toby will ever match his great song ""Beer for my Horses"". Personally I am glad he has chosen to record something other than arrogant, bombastic patriotic hype, but this CD is downright corny and the words are beyond trite. Surely he can't think all of us speak and think at such an adolescent level?The only two songs worth listening to on this CD are the swaggering hero vibe of song #5 ""Just the guy to do it""; and the painfilled song #9 ""I got it bad"" which sounds almost like a self confessional. Toby's voice wobbles at times and he mumbles words which is unlike him in the past. As for the rest of the CD, I'll pass."
2,average,"this is One of the few Toby Keith Albums where He actually uses His voice as to trying to stir up some mess.I enjoyed some of the Musical arrangements,but he is a very Predictable formulated Act.I don't ever see Him getting Good,but I think he might have a moment or two in musically where He is passible&this set has a couple of Aight cuts."
1,Stupid Red-Neck music.,"This guy is annoying, he thinks he's some kind of hot shot tough guy. He is the poster child for people who call themselves red neck johnny bad a$$es and drink beer until they act stupid, drive their trucks in the mud, and ride bulls and do the dosi-do, LAME. Southern culture sucks, get with the times, and out of the barn, anyone can make a hit country record. All you talk about is being a country boy and eating mom's home cooked vittles and that's a platinum record. Or you say something like ""we'll put a boot in your ass"" and set the american people back 100 years. I would recommend Toby Keiths music to anyone with a 3rd grade education. Which is probably most of you reading this."
1,Toby Keith is an embarrassing stereotype.,"Toby Keith is to southern people what gold-toothed rappers are to black people. He's an embarrassment, and he makes all southerners and country music listeners look like obnoxious drunken morons. He has set country music back 20 years. His music is a joke, and he is a joke. He is not fit to breathe the same air as Willie Nelson, Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton, Waylon Jennings, and the others with whom he will eventually share the Country Music Hall of Fame. Why listen to such drivel? If you want to listen to real country, there are better choices. Buy Loretta's ""Van Lear Rose"". If you want modern country, Keith Urban is way more talented than this loudmouth. The Dixie Chicks are better than Toby Keith, too. I wish he would go away and quit making us southerners look bad."
2,Watered down Toby Keith,"This album was a huge disappointment. I usually love Toby Keith's ""in-your-face"" country. This ablum is a little bit whiskey and way too much ice. It's as if Toby and Kenny Chesney went to the Caribbean to write together. Don't get me wrong, I like Kenny, but Toby is not Kenny (who is trying to be country's answer to Jimmy Buffet). Toby was the one who would always stand up and say what he was feeling no matter what everyone else around him thought. This album is a relationship album without the edge. It's romance and breaking up with just a couple of songs that have the Toby ""edge."" Most of the songs have had the edges a little too polished and shined. This album is more cookie-cutter country and less one-of-a-kind Toby. I've already sold mine on Ebay. Come back Toby, come back!!"
2,Music,Not as good as I hoped. I was mainly puchasing it for the song Walk Back To Me and I was not impressed with the rest of the songs.
1,BORRRRRRINGGGGGG,This guy is so narcissistic I can't believe he's so popoular. In many ways he's no different from his yang the Dixie Chicks. Two self agrandizing peas in a pod
1,Slow Slow Service and no response from Seller,"I have ordered 4 other CD's from Amazon and all from different sellers and have received all items, and still have not received this CD. I also asked the seller a question and never heard a response back. If you need an item right away, dont go with this seller."
5,Written with Heart,"I picked up The Women's Heart Book - and kept going right through to the glossery. The material is well organized and the information accessible and useful. Often I come away from a health related book feeling both guilty and worried. After reading The Women's Heart Book I am encouraged that I can make healthy lifestyle choices for myself and communicate intelligently with doctors if I or my sister has to confront a heart condition. The book addresses women in a personal yet professional manner - respectful of individual differences yet clear about how to apply conclusions from current research on women and heart-related diseases. I will keep this book on my reference shelf, and I thank the authors for giving me this excellent guide."
2,Boring,"I wish I could've liked this book, but the hero was so dull and the action so slow, I gave up after five chapters."
2,Polar Star,"The book arrived promptly and in good condition. My only disappointment is that I had ordered a First Edition but when it arrived I found that it was a First Print, Book-of-the-Month Club Edition. Not what I had hoped for."
4,arkady renko is back,Years ago I read Gorky Park and thought it was great. For some reason it took me this long to get back in the series. Glad I did! Looking forward to the further adventures of this russian policeman.
4,A good ride,"Arkady Renko's detecting style is to get beat up, then deny he is on the case, then get beat up again. Just when you think he might solve something, he gets beat up again."
5,CLASS ACT,"""Polar Star"" brings about the very best in contemporary thriller writing. The setting on board the Soviet factory ship is as bleak and unforgiving as you can imagine. Smith's main character Renko quite brilliant. The only other author I know in the class of this writer is British best selling author John Templeton Smith - check out his ""White Lie"". Seems the Smiths have cornered the market on quality."
4,Another classic Arkady Renko novel!!,"I'm so glad that I picked up Gorky Park because that book lead me to its sequel, Polar Star. This book, and character, are so enjoyable its almost hard to describe. While it seems all is at its lowest for underwhelming former investigator, Arkady Renko, the reader knows that somehow things will turn out for Renko. Unlike most serials however, everything isn't always coming roses for the lead and that's a part of this that is fantastic. Great stuff!"
5,Fast and exciting,"This is great! A worthy follow-up to ""Gorky Park."" I find it to be a much quicker read though, as it seemingly has more action going on in the begining."
5,Polar Star,"I picked up a copy of Polar Star when I was 12 and now, 2 years later, I still think it's one of the best book I've ever read. As I had not read Gorky Park, I found the concept completely unique. The main character's past, up to the events on the Polar Star, were helpfully refreshed by the superb literary skills of the author. I was able to quickly understand the story (and misfortunes) of Arkady Renko. In short, a body is pulled out of the sea by a Soviet fishing ship called the Polar Star. Captain Marchuk calls upon Renko to investigate into the case. He soon finds his superiors bullying him inot wrapping up the case, and sees something sinister is afoot. The story kept me enthralled right until the final confrontation in the frozen waters of the Bering Straits. Martin Cruz Smith is a genius of thriller writing. I also recommend Red Square (which I thought was the final Arkady book until I saw the Havana Bay reviews on this very site.)"
5,A high-impact mystery thriller,"This is a superb mystery/adventure/thriller which shows Martin Cruz-Smith's ability to place a sympathetic ""hero"" in an offbeat, unusual locale that he invests with so much life that you're there with the lead character, in the scene, experiencing what he experiences and moving with him inexorably toward a completely satisfying resolution of the mystery. I found Polar Star totally engaging, almost impossible to put down, and absolutely fascinating. Who could ask for more?"
4,A real treat if yo are ready for some gumnastics,"Come on. When I checked the reviews and found it averaging only two stars I had to object. The best book on Machiavelli is Leo Strauss' ""Thoughts on Machiavelli, which makes this one look like a first grade primer. That a book is too intellectually challenging is not an objection against it. This is an excellent biography. But it needs excellent readers."
3,flat weird,"Perhaps it was the order in which the characters were introduced, but for the first third of the book, I was sympathetic to the bad guy. Figuring out exactly who the good guy was became another issue. Maybe there was too big of a cast of characters or they weren't well described, but I just didn't connect with this novel."
4,Ben Rehder rocks!!!,"I ""purchased"" Flat Crazy for free, having read a about it on Michael Gallagher's blog. I enjoyed the zany and unpredictable exploits, multiple plots and colorful characters of small town Texas, which were skillfully developed by the author. Rehder joins the likes of Dave Barry and Carl Hiaissen among my favorite writers of humor."
4,Flat Crazy is just that,"It is a fun read and being a Texan and with my love of the Hill Country this was truly a book I could not put down. Yes it is true, there are truly people like the ones in this book but not only in Texas, they are everywhere."
