2,a hit and (mostly) miss collection of pulp fiction,"As with any massive collections of short stories one would a few duds. Maybe even more than a few. However in ""Pure Pulp"" I consider on 11 of the 35 short stories/novellas to be either good or excellent. The other 24 are only fair or downright poor or even amateurish. So with a hit rate of only 30% I'd say one can probably do better with other pulp fiction collections.For completeness sake, here are the books[authors] of the stories I liked:- In a Small Motel [MacDonald]- Sudden, Sudden Death [Powell]- That Stranger, My Son [Gilford]- Terrorists [Marlowe]- The Plunge [Goodis]- Down in the Valley [Reasoner]- Cry Silence [Brown]- Tick, Tock [Wandrei]- Guilt [Jakes]- Decision [Nielson]- Don't Twist My Arm [Ritchie]"
4,bright and reliable,"Plan to switch all of my Christmas lighting to LED in the next few years - much more durable and uses a tiny fraction of the electricity. This is a nice set, well made and it looks as though it should last for years, just as advertised. The only downside is that the light is VERY white, trending to the blue, rather than the softer white of traditional minature lights that trend to the amber."
5,Cool lights,"These are a bit more blue than white, but are very bright and do not warm up even after being on for a long time. I have them installed outside in freezing conditions up in the mountains of the Cascades, and so far they are quite reliable."
4,"Good, basic information, but reincarnation???????","I struggled over whether or not to keep this book.I decided to keep it because it has a lot of wholesome, practical information about caring for the whole child. Unfortunately the anthroposophical philosophy is found throughout. Now, I like some of the philosophy, as I believe in God and believe that it is healthy to live as close to nature as possible, to live according to daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly ""rhythms"". Yet I don't believe in reincarnation, so references to it turned me off.However, because of the overwhelming amount of sensible information it contains, I've decided to keep it anyway. If you don't mind doing a lot of sifting, or if you are anthroposophical, you may really want this book."
5,A must have,We fallow the recommendation from this book for any problem for our baby or to ad more to our knowledge.. a must to have
2,Still sitting in my fridge months later..,"I just can't bear to drink it, the taste is atrocious. If you can take the taste, I recommend it only for the nutrient content."
1,A very old recording by khaled ...,"this is a colection of khaled works before his musical revolution where you'll notice that all songs are empty from drums or any western instrumentals ,the wrong about this CD is that amazon wrote that it's original release date was 2000 but it's original real release date is 1979 !!! even before he travelled to france. it's not recommended for the new listener for rai music i personally recommend ""Khaled"" or ""Sahra"" ...."
3,A lot of Star Trek fiction is rather derivative..,"..most involving either the crew or selected members of it to solve some kind of crisis. And that was the feeling that I was getting when reading this book. The Day of Honor series crosses over four Star Trek series (ST, TNG, DS9, VGR) with a central theme, being the titular Day of Honor, the most important day in the Klingon calendar where ""they pay homage to all that makes them Klingon."" While Worf is working undercover as part of a planetary criminal network, his son Alexander is exploring one of his human ancestors on the holodeck with Captain Picard in tow. The book switches between the two locales, so there are two stories going on at the same time.But as I said earlier, a lot of Star Trek fiction just doesn't appeal to me. Maybe because it just keeps getting churned out month after month you get saturated by it. And these big inter-series crossover events happen once a year as well. So I really cannot recommend this book."
4,This one kept me awake reading at night--a real page-turner,"This may very well be the best Star Trek bookever. Asks some very deep questions to thinkabout. As everyone is saying, it is bloody,but it seemed necessary for the plot."
1,Don't read,"This book should have ended with the story of the Locusts. The rest of the book seems desconnected and the characters are not developed. It was one of the worse books I have ever read. There is no plot, direction, climax or anything else that holds your interest."
1,Bad Design,"When my Krups coffee grinder finally expired after several years of faithful service, I decided to order the Capresso because of its larger capacity and vaunted ""cool grind."" I wish I had ordered the Krups instead. The Capresso takes much longer to grind the coffee, and the design ensures that no matter how careful you are, you will spill ground coffee all over your counter. In the time since I bought it another reviewer has reported that his or her Capresso broke within six months. Do not buy this model!"
2,Very messy and sticks to inside,I bought this grinder after using a Braun for several years. Its not much quieter (if at all) and is so messy I'm buying another from Amazon today. I spend much more time getting the grounds out than I do on grinding the coffee. Don't believe the hype.
4,"Good, Quiet, and Fast Coffee Grinder","This coffee grinder works pretty well; it is the quietest grinder I have used, the cord conveniently wraps around the base of the machine to save space, and it looks very stylish with its platinum color and unique shape. The only downside is that, if you want a fine grind, you have to give it a gentle tap and shake here and there to get the grind off the base since the stainless steel blade is a bit high and therefore does not get to the partial beans that sticks on the base."
3,"OK, but small","Have not had any of the spillage problems reported. Question the long-term durability of the product, as I have used it <10 times, yet smell a burning smell whenever it is used for longer than 20 seconds. Also, it barely is large enough for one full pot. No real selector to make sure that you have a specific grind. Compact, cheap, and good-looking, but not too much of a grinder."
2,"Good if it's all you can afford, but...","it's well worth the extra money to spend $... more and get the Capresso 551.01. This has blades, not burrs. It can't store beans. It holds only enough for approx. 1 pot of coffee. There is no coarseness setting. It's basic, but it serves a very limited purpose well."
2,Grinder wore out in six months,"I bought this grinder six months ago and it already broke (the propeller-blade in the center spun loose and won't stay in anymore.) I used it to grind vitamins instead of coffee, but I did this with my previous grinder (made by Braun) and it lasted for years. I would not recommend this grinder for anyone who plans to use it regularly."
4,Good quality,Good value when on sale for $12. One point to note is that the grinding cup is not removable and therefore not washable.
5,Best calculator ever!,"First of all I would laike to say that the bips are really annoying, however, it is very easy to disable them in the MODES menu. It is not an easy calc, like some casio, though mucho powerfull. For instance a regular casio will only make upto 3 grade polinomians an the HP will make everything!Programing it is excellent!But the best thing is the incredible large sopport you can find in Internet, from tutorials to huge program libraries...I am studing engeneering and I think it's a must-have."
2,HP-48gx,Not in as good shape as I anticipated for the price of the calculator. Still a good calculator but overpriced.
3,Gives you hope but no specific information,"This 26-minute video is about 5 kids who recovered autism using biomedical approaches. It doesn't really tell you what the parents exactly did with the help of DAN! doctors. For those kids, its not very clear where they were on the spectrum at the time of diagnosis, apart from the fact that they showed few classic autistic symptoms. Its interesting to watch, gives you hope that autism is treatable but there is not much information that you can use from this video.I wouldn't spend 20 bucks for this video. Try to find it in a local library."
3,Informative but not very specific,"HiI found this to be generally informative but not very specific, e.g as regards the exact treatments used (what specific medication worked for which child, names of techniques and their proponents etc. ) An overall summary at the end would have helped.Touching but a little vague.On a technical note, the graphics used for the credits were very hazy.So counting the cost of the DVD AND the postage cost-not so sure...."
5,"Autism is treatable, recovery is POSSIBLE!!!","As the parent of a son who no longer carries the autism diagnosis because we have followed the exact biomedical interventions as the families in this documentary, I am elated that this message of recovery can be passed along to others via this DVD. Thank you, Generation Rescue!"
1,Ridiculous & dishonest business practices,"Be wary when placing this order as the states S&H of $4.38 changes to $32.01, over twice the cost of the stencils themselves. I canceled within 10 minutes of placing this order and get an email on day two stating that they're going to charge me anyway and I can just return it. Buyer Beware folks!"
1,Babbitt picks his nose and his feet smell.,"And his music is even more revolting than Babbitt's boogers and yes, his music stinks - worse than his feet. You have been warned: the music on this CD stinks out loud, and is revolting to anyone with a sense of hearing. I have listened to every bit of music on this CD, and you can believe that what I tell you is true."
4,Awesome book!,I have bought several Norwegian books and this one is by far the best one! It is very entertaining and keeps me wanting to learn more. I have only read half the book so far but I have only had it for 2 days! I cannot wait to see what happens with John and Bente! They really make learning alot funner!
3,"Not great, but none better","This is the only book I have found that attempts to communicate programming (the ""traditional"" text based kind of programming) to elementary age children. If anyone reading this review knows of another, please contact me!The book works after a fashion, with liberal corrections and advice from a highly available mentor. The parent/teacher must be a programmer to have any hope of guiding the elementary student through the various errors and omissions. Be careful of handing this book unsupervised to your child! It is full of questionable advice such as ""draw on your computer screen with erasable marker"", and references to files on the CD ROM that are in different directory, etc."
4,great intro for kids plus windows software,"This is the only suitable book I have found for kids to learn Logo, which is a kids-oriented programming language. It is written to make it fun for young children (my daughter is 7 and is really interested). This book comes with a CD containing a complete windows implementation of logo with many cool features; also includes a DOS version and a mac version."
3,The Great LOGO Adventure: dixcovering Logo on and off the co,"This book is well written and the material easily accessible. My son was writing short programs in less than an hour. My one critique is that the book description claims that book includes PC and Mac software; while it does, the Mac is nowhere near as capable as the PC. The book alludes to this, but the book and Mac software do not jibe. We had to find other materials and still, the Mac software only allows for one turtle. Again, the material is well-presented, just somewhat misleading for Mac users."
1,just wright; world premiere,"This was just a look at the actors as they worked the Red Carpet, I removed this from my device, Even forfree it wasn't worth taking up the space. It's agood movie, but I wasn't looking for the Red Carpet."
5,A Beautiful Imagination,"There is so much to say about this book, however I will try and keep it to a minimum. This book is fantastic. It's a short, little book with a story that flows out from the pages and into your imagination, casting you away into childhood. Well, that is, if your childhood contains a talking cat. I thought of how the relationship between the boy and his cat had reminiscent characteristics to the beloved Calvin and Hobbes. However, this story is more fantastical and heart-warming. After reading this, I felt happier and better about myself. I wanted to partake in the same journey the boy does. I recommend this to everyone and show them my copy. The art is beautiful, the story is beautiful. I'm glad I own this."
4,Bones into snow!,"An extremely fun, linear, humorous fantasy in which a boy and his cat go off the beaten path on their way to school only to befriend a cloud, anger the birds, and have a series of adventures. More fantastic than much of Jordan's work, and his line seems to have sharpened. The colors are glorious. Good for children of all ages."
4,Beautiful book,The Clouds Above is a beautifully designed book. Jordan Crane has an original voice and an interesting approach to characters and storytelling. My only complaint would be that I read it in about tweleve minutes even though its nearly 300 pages. Recommended
4,gorgeous -- please note:,"this book is beautiful, but:please note that the original plans to silkscreen the covers was abandoned because of prohibitive cost.the book is still a gorgeous object, just not silkscreened.-y."
2,No,"I am a huge Bernard Werber fan. I read every single book of his, including the ""Encyclopedie su savoir relatif et absolu"". But this book? Very strange, unlike any other book. Doesn't have a story, it's about the reader, and how he / she can be tranported by what ""the book"" tells him/ her. I am so used to Werber's incredible depth and views of the unknown, that my expectations were not met with this book."
5,"Inspirational, informative, moving.","Emile Norman attended art school for one day. His teacher told him he did his assignment wrong, and Emile quit. Together with his partner Brooks Clemens, he went on to sculpt, create glass and wood mosaics and build and live in the mountains of Big Sur.This film is a touchstone for those who swim against the tide. Beginning in the 1940's, it follows Emile Norman through the art world, film sets and galleries of California, New York City and back to Big Sur and Carmel. From mosaic zebras to marble statues to the 40 foot marble glass window on the Masonic Temple in San Francisco, Norman not only followed his own artistic visions, he invented many of his own tools, techniques and materials.But a summary can't describe this film or this artist, or how much this film means to me as an artist attempting to create my own style and survive in realistic economic times. I treasure my copy of this film and wish all people would see it."
3,"Okay, but not spectacular","While some stuff was useful from this book, for someone who has already been in the food service industry for several years now, it wasn't a large source of new information or ideas. This seems to be geared towards someone who seemingly has not run a restaurant before and/or has no idea how to manage employees."
1,All 4 Cats HATE IT!,I purchased this 4 months ago and it sits in my fridge-a complete waste of money. 2 cats are over 10 years old and 2 are under 2 years old. One of the 10 year old cats was around 2 living on the street when I found him. The 2 younger cats were betweeen 3-4 months old also starving in the streets when I took them in. They are all fixed/micro-chipped and after their experience not really fussy what they eat. NOT ONE SINGLE CAT will TOUCH this stuff. I cannot hide even a little bit in their beloved canned Fancy Feast as they will completely ignore it and just eat the dry cat food. I am going to give it to my friend who has a dog. Maybe she will have better luck. I do not recommend this product.
2,Poor quality,It was a present and I was very disappointed when the ball broke in half the first time it was played with.
5,BEST SINGLE OF THE YEAR!!,"This is, without a doubt, the best single I have heard in quite a long time! I don't usually write reviews, but this one is really a gem! Buy it as soon as possible! It's worth every penny!"
3,OK game if you like that sort of thing,"similar to many other games like Balderdash, etc. Some of the answers that are provided are either slightly or blatantly wrong, and some are just too easy. I didn't buy this for myself, though. I purchased it for someone else as a Christmas gift."
2,Disappointed,I was extremely surprised at how disappointed I was in this book. Especially since I am a Zane fan. But to be perfectly honest I should have did some more research on the book before purchasing. Because if I wanted to read a bunch of Dear Abby stories and responses I would have looked in the paper or any online blog. But again maybe thats my fault for just purchasing the book on the author alone and not seeing what the book was about first.
4,Outstanding book,I definintely love Zane's novels. And this book of advice is the ultimate reading experience. I definitely recommend this book to everyone out there who want to be sexually liberated!
2,Not what I expected,"This is definitley not what I expected... I have followed Zane's career since the beginning, and this was not a good read.... Disappointed, but still a loyal fan....I do not recommend this as a start for readers new to Urban Erotica.....trust me on this."
5,OMG!!,This book is a must read for everybody...Not only is it interesting u will learn something from it too...Not like u cant learn anything from other Zane books but this one is a definite help book
4,Same Script Different Cast....,"For those of you who are new to Zane, this book will provide a wealth of knowledge on how to release your inhibitions and have the great sex you always hear about. For those of us who have been following her career since the beginning, I suggest you go to Barnes and Nobles and read it like I did cuz there's nothing new to be learned. This is not a novel; it is a compilation of questions from readers across the globe--from virgins, to Baptist preacher's wives, to nymphos.....It is set up in the Ann Landers Q& A format. This book answers broad spectrums of questions and can provide useful for the new fans and the old fans. I did see some things in there that I had forgotten about so overall it was pretty informative and as ALWAYS titillating."
4,It's Zane,It's Zane!! What more can I say. This book is very insightful....Zane goes where many would like to but are afraid.. She knows no boundaries and takes no prisoners........Whatever Zane writes I read....Next to the Cosmopolitan magazine...Zane's books are like chapters in Bible written just for women!!!
4,Some great plays,"My favorite play was Eurydice by Sarah Ruhl. I'm not sure if this is out in any other form, but certainly the book is worth buying just to read this play, which has the deftness and economy of a classic Greek text, and the emotional range and subjective depth of a modern classic. She's my favorite author of plays."
2,Euripides is rolling in his grave.,"I took a graduate class on Greek theatre and the first part was dedicated to the Tragedies. Then we turned to the plays written based on those tragedies, and this was our book.First, if you wish to read this book or use it, you'll have to be up on your Greek tragedies. Most of the stuff assumes you know those plays well so that you can understand the inside info. Some of the plays were simply aweful and a few were even offensive to the point that I quit reading them. And as a theatre student, I like to think I can stomach a lot but where in the story of Hippolytus and Phaedra does a twelve-year-old boast about all the sexual experiences she's had? Ugh. If it were old, I MAY understand based on culture, but as a modern subplot added on, it's just revolting.There were a couple of plays that were okay, and I just love Sarah Ruhl's adaptation. If you've read the classics, reread them before you read this book, and be prepared for the strange."
1,"No energy, much hectic","My expectation of watching a video with this topic is that the instructor shows at least some inner focus towards what he is teaching. This instructor is just plain hectic and restless. The exercises itself may be useful but the instructor takes away all the energetic exercises by simpley being incongruent in his teachings. Watching this video makes you feel nervous ,too after some minutes. Although the landscape in the background looks nice, the rest is amateur performance. Bad ratio between price and information."
5,Excellent Value,"Great value and probably good enough for most home cooks. Unless you're going to be fastidious about the care of your cutlery, don't spend more on ""better"" knives."
3,Not What I Had Hoped For,"I was so excited by the glowing comments about this knife. I failed, however, to read the few negative comments about how cheap it feels. Compared to my other knives it feels wimpy (for lack of a better word) in my hands and I don't enjoy using it. I am going to try to stick it out since so many people rave about it but I have been really disappointed in the lightweight nature of the handle. Luckily it was not expensive. The blade seems great but I have not had it long enough to know how it holds up."
4,Great knife,"Holds an edge good, fits the hand well, could be just a touch heavier. It is my new go to knife for just about everything. I have had it for a few months now and haven't had to touch up the edge yet. It does meat, fruit, and vegetables equally well. It sucks for cheese, but I have a different knife for that."
5,Great knife,"This knife came on time, and was very sharp out of the box. I wasn't expecting such a quality knife for such a low price. I'll be buying more from this company."
4,Lightweight and great addition to my other Fribrox knife set,"My 8"" chopping knife gets used the most and I bought this because I have a spare slot in my block and I thought the corregated edges would help when dicing veggies. It does help, but some veggies still stick. This knife is lightweight and really does the job. Overall pleased and would recommend it.Pro: Lightweight, easy to useCon: Some veggies do still stick, and the handle is different than my other Forecshner Victorinox Fibrox knifes."
4,light weight but effective,"I like this knife. I moved recently and still cannot find where two of my best knives are hiding so I sent for this one.The price is good, it is very sharp and I like the lighter weight for chopping etc.I would buy another if this one holds up over time."
4,Sharp knife,"First, I'm a novice in the knife arena with only a Calphalon 8"" and 6"" chef knives to compare against. The Victorinox cuts through veggies easier (even after I sharpening the Calphalons). The knife is very light and the blade is thin which probably allows it to glide through things easier than thicker knives. Every other night usage for about a month and no dulling that has been noticeable. I would buy it again now that I know how it performs. A good value..."
5,7-inch Santoku Knife,"a helpful tool for every kitchen- this knife has multi-purposes that will satify many kitchen needs to assist in food preparation-""try it you""ll like it"""
5,Dishwasher (compare vs. Wusthof Ikon Classic),"Everything about this knife is wonderful, and especially the cutting edge and the handle. I really like the Santoku edge instead of the Chef's edge because there is less rocking required to cut. The handle is very comfortable too. I put it in the dishwasher top rack, no problem, although it claims handwashing is recommended. The edge has held up to daily use and the dishwasher for over 9 months. The hand looks like new.This is not a replacement for the Wusthof Ikon Classic (I've tried both), but the Ikon Classic is over 3x the price.Wusthof Classic Ikon 7-Inch Santoku, Hollow Edge, Black"
3,lost its sharpness quickly,"Because of its manufacturer, this knife should have been of a better quality than others I've purchased. Although I can sharpen it, I expected that it would stay as initially sharp for a longer time--went away quite quickly."
1,Terrible Knife,This knife won't cut. It's dull. The blade became discolored after I washed it the first time. Do not waste your money on this product. I purchased Victorinox because of the name reputation. What a disappointment.
3,"was Very sharp at first, and got dull Quickly","Initially, this seemed like an excellent knife. The blade was so sharp, and it did a decent job not sticking to food. The balance was decent, though it seemed to lack the heft I enjoy in my other knives. After only a few weeks, the blade no longer passes the tomato test, crushing them rather than slicing through the skin. It is dull. Quite dull. Did I put it in the dishwasher? Nope. Nor did I slice anything I shouldn't be slicing. I don't recommend this knife; my old ones feel sharper than this one, and they have been with me for years."
4,"Cuts beautifully, and easy to handle...","This is an excellent slicing knife for veggies, meat, etc. It's very sharp, easy to handle, and the grip fits perfectly into my hand. I like it much better than my $75 Kyocera ceramic knife. This one seems sharper and less fussy to work with (you always have to be so careful not to bend or twist ceramic knives)."
5,Great knife at a great price,I love this knife. It cuts well; it's easy to use. I also have a Victorinox chefs knife which has held up wonderfully for 12 years.
4,Good Value and Very Sharp,"Even after reading most of these reviews, I was surprised at how small, light and almost flimsy this knife is. This knife should be thought of as more of a blunt nosed chef's knife than a hybrid of a chef and cleaver. It is way too light to be used to chop bones or hack away at tough items.On the bright side, it is extremely sharp and holds its edge very well. I like how maneuverable it is and it can almost be used as a paring knife if you're careful.For slicing tomatoes and working through just about any other small to medium sized fruit or vegetable, it is my go-to knife.The Victorinox steel is very corrosion resistant and even after leaving it unwashed in the sink for a day or two when being lazy, it hasn't acquired any rust spots or discoloration."
5,The Best I've Ever Used!,"This is the BEST knife I've ever used! Period! I just ordered the 3-Set of knives to complement this one. You CAN'T go wrong with these knives! You can spend 3 times the money, and not get better quality. Go Ahead. BUY!!!"
2,Engineering issue,"Knife is good for the price for a home cook, but.Pros:- The handle provides a good grip and keeps your fingers off the cutting board.- The edge of the blade is slightly curved, just enough to provide good mincing using a pivot movement.- The knife holds good edge, but be aware that it will require re-sharpenning once in a while, so it is a good idea to have a good sharpner, like the ""Messermeister 12-Inch Ceramic Rod Knife Sharpener"" sold in Amazon.Cons:- The side grooves just drives me crazy. This is probably something engineered and never tested, as it supposed to avoid chopped food from sticking to the blade, it actually creates a vaccum and everything that is bigger than 1/2in would stick to the blade as you chopp. Very frustrating. My thoughts are that the gooves would work as planned if it would extend all the way to the edge (thick side) of the knife.This is making me drop the rating on this knife."
4,a true value on a great kinfe,i have used r.h. forschner knives since 1966.the best kitchen knife value there is.i like this one as much as all of my others.
3,It seems like a cheap knife but it cuts well,"The materials are cheap, but the knife works. I've had it about a month or two and it cuts vegetables well. It was not super sharp on some tomatoes tough. It seems like a cheapo knife, but it was so inexpensive I'm not disappointed. I got what I paid for."
4,Great blade...handle a little cheap feeling,"Overall, this is a great knife. It is really sharp and ultimately, that is why I wanted it. My only complaint is that the handle is kind of cheap feeling. Also, I wish it came with a sheath. I would still recommend it for the price."
3,Does the Job But...,"I thought this would be one of my favorite knives. Although it does its job, the knife doesn't seem to have enough heft to hold as comfortably as some of my other knives."
4,A pleasure to use,"Light, razor sharp and feels very comfortable in my hands. My only complaint is that the grooves don't really prevent food from sticking to the blade."
4,But how do you thank someone who has taken you from crayons to perfume?,"This is the sixth volume in Rhino Records' series of CDs devoted to the British Invasion of rock. It is an interesting mix of big hits and obscurities. Most of the songs are quite good, but I don't really care for the track by the Bachelors."
1,Useless.,"Pieces stick to each other, which is charming, but not to other surfaces, which is useless. Would not adhere to any surface, thus unable to use!"
3,???,"I don't understand why Champion doesn't improve upon this part: the screen and this holder are like oil and water. Yes, you can get them to fit, but don't underestimate how easy it is to snap the screen or chip the edge of the holder."
4,Wonderful - but ...,I found Accordiorama to be a true delight. The only issue I have with the recording is the use of electronic instruments. Considering the date of the recording this is to be expected. I was truly hoping for a totally acoustic recording. I have played the accordion since childhood and have participated in accordion bands and appreciate the level of professionalism that went into the making of this album. I would recommend this recording to all accordion and/or music lovers.
3,Great Game With Poor Platform,"I truly enjoy playing this game. The simulation allows players to participate in historically accurate scenarios from the Normandy invasion. Very playable, historically accurate, and lots of fun.The game falls down on the quality of its programming. It can be rather slow paced (a typical scenario runs about 90-minutes), and the program tends to experience fatal programming conflicts that cause the game to crash --very, very frusterating.For the price it was great, but left me wanting more.--Jeff"
3,Squad Leader,"This game had the potential to be a very interesting and exciting product that war gamers could really enjoy. The idea of a strategy game at the squad level is a good one, if done properly. However, the developers have made this game much too cumbersome to maintain the players interest. Instead of considering strategy, the player is relegated to trying to figure out how to interact with it. Not a game I will keep coming back to."
2,"Squad Leader..NICE BOX, BUT THIS GAME JUST ISN'T HAPPENING!!","I bought this game a couple of days ago. I thought it was going to be really fun, but to my mistake it's really complicated and the computer AI takes forever to make it's moves. I'm glad I bought this game from a store where they give you 10 day to play the game and figure out if you wanna keep it. I definatley am goin to return this. I really enjoy playing WW II strategic games, but this game really blows. The graphics are good and the sound is really cool... but don't let that fool you."
2,"failed attempt, but PLEASE try again!","Squad leader was the bomb as I was growing up. Believe me, I was elated at the prospect. Unfortunately, the dang thing crashes constantly. It did so on my last system and my new one. It's fairly slow to respond to commands, etc. If it weren't for these technical difficulites, it would be a masterpiece. When it works it's a blast but I've simply given up on playing it at this point and am looking for something new to satisfy my SL crave. Atari (and I know what your name means in Japanese) I have the utmost respect for you, but please try this again. If you make an SL II, as the old but functioning, you will have my money."
3,Not bad,"Like others say, this book was exactly like the movie. It's a good book if you're just looking for a light, fun read. This book does not go very in depth with the characters, which was one of the things I did not like about it. It makes you feel sorry for the girls of that generation and the kind of life that they were pushed into, even if they were well educated."
3,I'm gald I've borrowed this from the Library instead of buying...,"I thought that the movie was based on the book, not visa versa, so when the book caught my eye at the library I checked t out.It wasn't such a horrible read, but it did read like the movie, and gave no extra information, motivation, etc. to any of the characters, nor did it enhance the story line.My suggestion? See the movie, at least it has the visuals."
5,creative,"Its a great book, it presents alot of great solutions very creative ones for the new way of desing offices sapces."
4,The Shiny Side of Summer!,"I brought this shoe in silver at Macy's and loved it because it's simple, sexy and neutral enough to go with anything. (jeans, shorts, sundresses, etc.) The gold sold out fast so, I was happy when I found them on Amazon. I should tell you that these run about half size small. I wear an 8.5 and only a sz 9 would do in these. They're pretty comfortable and good for distance, but be sure to get your toes ready because the shine attracts lots of eyeballs to your feet!"
3,Tiny!,I almost always wear a 6 1/2- especially in sandals and flip flops and I would need at least 7 or 7 1/2 in these. They are tiny!! They looked tiny in the box and my feet hang over the back. They are way too small!!!!!
2,cute sandal but eh,I bought this sandal because I wanted a more stylish but casual sandal. The band actually cut into my foot and made the shoe uncomfortable to wear and my toes actually were forced to spead open for whatever reason. I only wear them if I can't find anything else to go with the particular outfit.
2,Nine West Women's Olessa Wedge...,I paid less than $20 for this shoes so I didn't expect much. I guess as the saying goes...you get what you pay for right.
4,Eccentric Preachers,"This book by Charles Spurgeon which I received from Amazon recently is unexpectedly hilarious, but in it's fun really cuts through wrong attitudes.and shows self righteous judgementalism as not acceptable or helpful to the ministers who preach. Excellent reading written by a very insightful author and you will find some of your own attitudes being enlightened and healed."
5,The Gospel of Buddha,Interesting book. Really like it and I received it very quickly and in the condition that was stated. Thanks for you quick service.
4,great!,"Got the item sooner than I thought, and it works great! All cheaper than trying to find one in stores during the holidays."
5,The story of a courageous woman's fight to find her husband,"I read this book for the first time when I was nine and loved it. I also have a biased opinion because I have always thought of Barbara as my aunt. Her husband, Billy, was my mom's first cousin. My mom was very close to Billy and thought of him as a brother. I have always admired Barbara for her literary talent and her devotion to her family. Today, Oct. 15, 1998, I will be standing in my mother's place at the opening of the traveling Vietnam Wall memorial at the Brockton VA hospital. Billy's name is on this wall, and he will be honored today. Even though I never met Billy, I feel like I know him from reading this book and from the countless stories that I have heard over the years. I have given my copy of this book to many people I know and all of them loved this book. This book successfully depicts the struggle that many POW/MIA families endured and unfortunately still do, in order to find out what happened to their loved ones."
2,Not wishing well,"Where to begin? It would take this listener days to get past the sheer audacity required to ""rename"" one's self - and then choose ""Carnelian""! I thought perhaps that it was an obscure character from a Star Trek episode. At least that would have been funny.I suppose that ""Carnelian"" is now hanging with other single-moniker types such as Prince, Madonna and Jesus (on another spiritual plane, of course).As for the music? Well, it's not that bad, however the lyrics are atrocious. While I'm certain that ""Carnelian"" is indeed an emotional lad, is it necessary to include the word ""emotional"" in almost EVERY song description? How can a song like ""Raven's Cathedral"" inspire anything other than visions of Edgar Allen Poe?MY singular emotion while suffering through this bit of new age loopiness is exasperation. I'll pass on the herbal tea also - thanks."
4,Every metal band uses it in some shape or form...,"Every single metal band on earth hides behind the facades of satanism, cannibalism, you name a morbid fascination and there is a group that bases itself around it. But who really cares, yes it's an act but if it sounds good that's fine, the bands aren't asking you to buy into and worship them like a cult, you like and/or buy the music or you don't it's that simple. Anyway, on with my review, I liked this cd but I don't think it was their best. Some of the tracks could have done with a little less keyboard and a little more ROAR and guitar...oh and a little more cowbell couldn't hurt. But anyway, good cd, good x-mas gift for any COF fan."
3,For those too caught up to pay any attention,"The female vocals on the track ""Nymphetamine"" are done by Liv Kristine of Leaves' Eyes. She is the ex-vocalist of Theatre of Tragedy combined with musicians of Atrocity. The MOST talent displayed on this album is done by her and if you want something good and original, check them out."
2,its just not the same.......,"Cradle of filth has losted i admit i liked this cd when i first got it, but i only liked it for like the first 2 3 days i had it after that i havent really listen to it, i listen to principle of evil made flesh and from cradle to enslave more than nymphetamine, all it does now is collect dust, but if u have been a cradle of filth fan for a while youll problably like it for the first week or so, after a while itll get boring becouse dani repeats himself to much and if u are a musician once u hear the the music u can tell all of it is about the same thing it just reapeat its self over and over again, well what iam trying to say is that it sucks after a mwhile, thats about it hopefully their next cd is better than their last two i hope this helped u out peace...."
1,Worth laughing at,Why is Liv Kristine on one of their songs? Its probably the only good part of the album. The rest is worth laughing at.Cradle of Filth = Evil and Scary?I don't think so.
4,Bottom Line,"Nymphetamine is somewhere in the middle. Not as good as Midian or Cruelty, better than Principle. Ranks about the same as Damnation. There is growth here, and the vocals are a bit different, but there is too much simplicity and way too much slow and moody filler. The good parts of this cd however, are great. Pick it up if you are a fan, obviously - but if you are going to start your Cradle collection - start with Midian."
4,Good to own,"Great to own if you like CoF,even if you already own a copy of Nymphetamine,but lets get one thing straight Nymphetamine(Sara Jezebel Diva version) is AWFUL Liv Kristine version is far superior in every way. Ive noticed some people bash this album yet they still listen to it,wonder why..In my opinion this album is just as good as any other Cradle album.. the Extra tracks on this make it worth buying"
1,Metal At It's Most Contrived,"Cradle Of Filth embarrassingly holds the title of worst vocalist ever, as voted for by me. They also hold the title of biggest fake scary dudes, and again, I voted this.The obviously misguided youths that follow this band have no excuse, everyone can see the false pretences on which COF boost their career on - black metal with scary occult themes.These guys are NOT scary, NOT cool, NOT black (not as in race, which they aren't either) or anything really...except fakers.The horrible image this band has goes with the horrible music. Danny ""Filth"" sings like a filthy animal, and the guitar onslaught is a real drag. If Brittney Spears were to write metal songs, they would come out like this. REALLY boring and predictable writing.If like me you feel this kinda horrible WANKERY needs to be shown some disrespect, hit the 'helpful' button my friend."
3,gee...,"To those who don't know: the ""nymphette"" on the Nymphetamine Fix is Liv Kristine Espenaes, you know, from Leaves' Eyes. So what I say: damn, Cradle, how low can you go?! But I adore this track when Sarah sings it. It's my opinion, but this album is so not-Cradle...greetings"
5,BUY THIS,"I'M A DIE HARD CRADLE FAN AS WELL AINTO DEATH METAL ,SPEED AND BLACK. THIS IS A MUST HAVE CD FOR ANY CRADLE FAN FOR AWHILE OR IF ONE IS NEW TO THEIR MUSIC.BUY IT"
3,Just ok,There is no comparison between this album and their albums till Midian. They are much much better than this one. Hera are a few good songs but there aren't good melodies and atmosphere. I have a sense that they just play to play and not to have a really good result. And Nympletamine is not so great song to be celebrated and awarded. Maybe I have different taste of music who knows. If you are very fanatic fan then get this album otherwise stay on their first albums till Midian.
5,Not their best but a must have album for any heavy metal fan.,"Although not as good as thornography, if u like CoF then both albums are necessaties"
4,BLack/death whatever in the hell it is...,"ITS GOOD. Yes old school black metal was not symphonic save for emperor and dimmu and a few others but why cant people just appreciate Cradle as Metal and to the guy below me who said they are posers is a tard. The drummer happens to be the drummer from AT THE GATES. ITS METAL PLAIN AND SIMPLE . Whether its BLack, SYmphonic black, Death, or whatever kinda thrash , its freakin metal. Thank god bands like Cradle , Dimmu, Borknagar, Immortal, Mayhem ,GOgoroth, Carpathian forest, Dark funeral , Emperor exist or did exist. Actually dont thank god for black metal thats wrong. THis is a good album and I listen to it alot.ALso get the new HAUNTED and 3 inches of BLOOD. Good metal is good metal and this is good metal."
3,"A quick note for John, our Spotlight Reviewer","James had next to nothing to do with the writing, he was told what to play. The album was written mostly by Martin and Paul, and Paul didn't even actually end up playing much on the album. If you dislike the writing on the album, you can't blame James as he was essentially treated as a session musician, who also did the tour. That is all. (except... honestly who likes ICP? The sheer mechanics of it are mind boggling).I'm basically indifferent to this album. It's decent, but i don't find myself wanting to listen to it. Oh, and Nymphetamine (Fix) IS the best song on the album, no doubt. People are weird."
1,PIXIE ROCK FOR KIDS,Be very carefull if you buy this cd. You may become very frightened- maybe nightmares or even bed wetting.This is because the 'singer' of this band is really a scary demon. You can tell hes not putting it on. Hes a Pixie demon.Hes so evil and scarey he decided to form a 'band' from session musicians with the intension of frightening the wits out of impressionable 12 year old boys. ooooOOOOOO!!!If his 'singing' and his 'band' werent scarey enough there are some terrifying scoobydo keyboards.Anyway you can tell theyre really evil cos theres pictures of graveyards and they even swear and everything.I hope he doesnt get me- he might drag me down to Pixie demonlandworld- where everyone wears long black coats and wears their mums make-up.
1,Worst album yet,"I'm not going to play the ""sell-out"" card. I'm not going to play the ""true black metal"" card. But I am going to say this is CoF's worst album ever. If I want symphonic female Kate Bush/Tori Amos passages, I'll listen to Tristania. There's no bite, no aggression to this album. Half of this fits more into a category of ""dated power metal"" than the Gothic Black Metal we've come to expect. Dani's vocal arrangements are redundant and merely a re-vomiting of everything he's done to date. No barriers broken here. Damnation and a Day led me to think this would be an excellent follow-up. Save your money and save the embarassment. Go buy a Britney Spears album or something else instead."
1,"WOW, THIS REALLY SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!","Somewhere between the awful subject matter and unbarable vocals it hits you, ""I actually paid money for THIS?!?!?!?! OMG!"" Whats the deal with dani filth anyway? I've heard five year old girls put more balls into vocals than that male/female (I'm not sure of the proper gender to use). Simply put, Cradle of Filth is for smelly, crybaby middle school kids that have no life. If you actually bought this with your hard earned money do yourself a favor and burn this album, that's about all it's good for!"
1,totally unscary and innocuous,"This new nord odin worshipping metal is cheesy, although maybe not specifically this band . Egypt taught the loudmouth Greeks everything, read some Herotodus and find out. India is the most beautiful spiritual culture. this music has the illusion of being creative. listen to nomeansno or victims family or some jazz or fusion. this is not dark try diamanda galais. Bad brains are way better. try flesh parade or something that has humour. Watchtower are the kings of metal. American bands are way cooler except for sabbat, napalm,at the gates,king diamond, celtic frost,rudimentary peni,carcass and maybe a few or more others. The Fifth Dimension and Wesley Willis give off way better energy. Imanentize the Eschaton of 2012 and beware the Numshub of Enki and the Shem of the jealous demiurge Ialdaboath."
5,book 2 in one amazing trilogy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this book trilogy is amazing i love star wars books star wars books = the best of the best star wars is and always will be the best of the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Ironic Justice,"Why not build another Death Star? Of course they were going to do it, and of course they would have to be stopped. But god is in the details, and so it is here. The tone of the book will drip with irony and the all-too just and satisfying ending will fulfill the promise of this review's title."
1,Two thumbs waaaaaaay down,"This is the worst Star Wars book ever. The next time KJA writes a book(hopefully never) he should keep in mind that A. Killing every minor character doest't make the book interesting, B. An exiting plot DOES matter, and C. Boring and stupid characters don't help the book that much. My family is having a yard sale this weekend, and you can bet that this book will be there."
3,Definitely not the best...,"Another superweapon? What's next? An alien force tries to capture Leia's children (again!). All in all I rather liked this novel except for the Hutt/superweapon theme. I thought this whole subplot ran into a deadend and was too easily disposed of at the conclusion of the novel.And this leads me to the Star Wars novels of late. Yes, there's a formula in writing them and you can't kill off the main characters but I would like to challenege the authors out there. How about you give us readers less of the superweapons and more creative thinking? Try stepping outside the typical Star Wars themes and do something different. (How about a trilogy in which the remaining Imperials and rebels need to work together to stop an alien race...) Anything would be better than the same old themes.As for what I liked in Darksaber: Anderson has a good knack at building an action scene. The battles were well written yet the entire suspense of the novel was rather weak"
1,"Darksaber, waste of time","I read The Jedi Academy Trilogy by K Anderson, and that was cool, but this? A Lovey Dovey Star Wars, which is totally boring. Go read the Zahn books, this is crap...."
1,Listen to Me!!,"Ok. You have read the rest of the reviews so you know the mixed feelings people have about this book. Well I can tell you the bottom line right now. KJA does NOT know how to right a Star Wars novel. The man needs to work more on developing a fresh idea, not taking off ideas from others. This book was just as bad as his Jedi Academy trilogy. The characters are shallow, the plot is unthinkable, and the ideas are simply replays of his past books. I know that everyone has already said that this is a book with repeated ideas, but it is impossible to ignore. If there ever was a book that I would tell people not to buy THIS IS IT!"
4,Well.....,"First of all, there are to many story lines. second of all, if one jedi can repel a 17 star destroyer attack force then why don't they just do it every time there is a fight? and the whole focus was supposed to be a new superweapon (BORING) witch ended up not working and geting destroyed by asteroids. alo i didn't like the way big capitol ships were treated like starfighters."
5,Anderson Perhaps Best Star Wars Imagineer,This was one of my favorite single novels in the Star Wars saga. Anderson and Zahn are the most talented web spinners of this series and it shows in Darksaber. A MUST READ for every Star Wars fan.
2,Some good ideas that never quite fuse together,"DARKSABER has some fine moments and care has gone into MOST of it. I'm going to write this next line so as not to spoil, but when two certain Jedi are surrounded by villians but still not undetected, why the hell do they start a rumble with all of them instead of clouding those weak-minds and slipping out of there? Lemelisk is written well, and the reader will also learn more about the Hutts, Sand People and a few other peripheral characters. But the story is sketchy at best; I agree with those that say this deadly- superweapon-every-book stuff is very old (in this one even a character thinks it!!!!)"
2,Cat-lovers forget about this book,"In a major part of this book all that happens is that everyone almost dies, and the best two characters, as well as others, do--the two Cathars (Anderson is NOT writing for cat-lovers)--and the worst character has to be one of the only two that survive (Callista). If you bought this book, you might be able to get trade credit at a used book store."
4,This story was half good-half bad,"Ok where do i star..I think that there are many good parts about Admiral Daala and her attempt to destroy the rebels..But the Hutts buildiing a superweapon that gets crushed by an asteroid and doesn't even work? I would have loved this story EVEN more if the stupid thing had actually WORKED..Ah well, it was still a good book!"
2,"okay to borrow, but don't buy it","Kevin J. Anderson really disappoints me. When I read the summary of the book, I was really looking forward to a real superweapon. IT WAS A JOKE!!! I don't think Kevin really takes the Star Wars Universe seriously. Kevin has no right to kill off Madine on such a dumb mission. I feel as if the events of Darksaber didn't really matter...that they had no real effect on the characters. And when all is said and done, all the events can just be forgotten. Well I wish that I could just as easily wipe the book out of my memory.Don't buy this book. Borrow it, if you can, if you're curious. And if you can't, well don't worry, you're not missing much. I don't think I'll ever buy another KJA book again."
5,well writen!,"this book, darksaber, is one of the best books i have read so far. it is past paced and full of action. i really love the way the writer has incorporated the JEDI acedemy. the story line was well thought out coverd all details fully! i hope to c more books writen like this! this book gets ""******"" stars on my list! great book and i recomend it for all!!!!"
2,Star Wars : Darksaber,"I'm an avid fan of the Star Wars books but Kevin Anderson's books are sometimes just plain corny. The book is entertaining enough if you are a Star Wars fan, but there are better ones out there. I was interested in what would happen to Luke's lover interest Callista (thank god he finally got one), but the ending was disappointing."
2,Quick! Jump in the escape pod!,"Let me preface by saying that this was my first Star Wars novel, and I must say that I found it to be a frustrating experience. Anderson has crafted a tale that delivers action (unarmed Jedis versus 17 Imperial Star Destroyers!) and a few genuinely amusing moments. But his dismal writing style keeps getting in the way of the story he's trying to tell. He repeats himself constantly, often writing essentially the same thing three times on one page. It seems as though Anderson is just trying to take up space so he can reach page 400. And although Luke is only in about a quarter of the novel, Anderson succeeds in making him an annoying character. (I could see why Callista dumped him.) Overall, the book is what it is: a way to eat up the hours on the plane from Los Angeles to New York."
3,Light weight,"Quick read. Light wieght, but what do you expect from a Star Wars novel. Some of the scenes are just silly."
4,Extremely cool!!! A lot of fun reading it,"I really liked this book a lot. It was actually the first SW book I read because I haven't become such a fan of SW until Feb 1998. But anyways, ""Darksaber"" is totally thrilling and it got me into reading more and more SW novels. Ok, the story is not the most extraordinary or intelligent I have ever seen but it keeps the reader excited throughout the whole book. I guess every SW author has his or her own way of writing and presenting things and Anderson's is definitely ACTION!! But don't worry if you are someone who prefers reading things about the Jedi Knights, the Empire, or good characterizations - you'll get that, too, in ""Darksaber"". However, I recommend reading ""Children of the Jedi"" by Barbara Hambly prior to this novel because Darksaber is actually kind of the ""sequel"" to Hambly's book. But you should go and read this, it'll definitely thrill you!!!"
1,Not my style,"First of all, let me note that I am a fan of the Empire and of Mr. Tim Zahn's works. That being noted it should be fairly obvious why I detest this book so much. I had read Anderson's triolgy and thought it was a decent premise, if lacking in follow-through, especially in the character of Admiral Daala, who never lived up to the expectations on her, given her rank and gender. But I would let bygones be bygones and try his new book. Never again. Daala was hopelessly incompentent, and Pellaeon was nothing more than a shadow of a compentent man. Neither of these characters deserve this treatment, and the heroes are sullied by their defeat of such caricatures of decent villians. Go read the Zahn or Stackpole books or _Truce at Bakura_ for decent _Star Wars_. Don't bother with this."
4,Exciting but a little repetitive,"I think overall this was a good book. The plot was exciting, even thought there was another superweapon. I think Anderson decided to throw in another weapon because it sort-of helped tie up loose ends and provided another threat to the New Republic. Even though this book is called Darksaber, the main threat is Daala. In my opinion, Anderson does a very good job of describing her and her feelings. ONe other thing that was good about this book was Anderson explained about Callista. I haven't read any of the other books that tell about herm but I know basically what happens."
1,Story Lines couldn't get much worse,.The relationship between Qwi and Wedge--simply unbelievable. And what-about killing off Crix Madine? I mean he was and will always be a great character He didn't derserve to die on the blob of blubber's superweapon. Or the incredible dying man? Okay the Emperor was cruel but SEVEN TIMES? I don't think so. The best Star Wars novels were written by Stackpole and Allston. Other series like the Grand Admiral Thrawn Series were good but this was just down right pathetic. END
1,At least the Jedi Academy Trilogy had a good story,Anderson is just a terrible writer. But if the story is good enough you can grit your teeth and find some enjoyment. The Darksaber story is not one of those. Don't read this bood.
3,what the?,"Okay this book was okay, but now thinking back on it this book sucked, flat out. When Krix was killed i almost burned the thing, but i waited untill i finneshed. Another thing Durga the Hutt was not that stupid, this book made him look like an idiot. I have three words PLOT DOES MATTER!!"
5,one of the best,"Darksaber was one of the best Star Wars books ever. When I was reading it I thought I was watching it on screen, all the charecters talk the same and have the same attitude. The only flaw is that this book had to be part of the Callista triology (shudder)and mr. Anderson, you can sure write a Star Wars book"
3,Decent,"A great book, although it uses characters and planets that we have never heard about. It's kind of a little off-track from the original star wars, but it is still ok. Conclusion: Great book, but it is off the track from the star wars we know."
3,Fair enough . . .,"Usually, I tremendously enjoy Kevin J. Anderson's books. This, unfortunately, was not one of his better ones. I didn't like how the super weapon malfunctioned. I was looking forward fo a last minute save, like in A New Hope. There wasn't much of Leia, and that wasn't good. She's one of my favorite characters. Still, if you're looking for an okay Star Wars novel that you can read without gagging (unlike Splinter of the Mind's Eye) this is a worth-while book."
3,Tired,"Another permutation of the imperial-superweapon plot device, which is getting overly tired and seems to take the place of a compelling story. Crix Madine's fate seems forced (done for the sake of doing it, lacking the emotional resonance such a fate should have) and the fate of the Darksaber seems anticlimatic. Anderson has revealed himself as an author with nothing new to add to the SW Universe."
3,good book something to enjoy but not a classic.,I am and avid reader of Mr. andersen work though this was not his best work. Though enjoy how he pulled the fiesty admiral Daala to be the enemy of the New Republic. But to be trueful i thought you could use more of Mara jade. Though I was a little surprised that Callista disappeared though being Luke love I realized that another charcter been drawn be his true love. this not your greatest but a good one.
2,Too quick for tastes,"Darksaber was too quick, and Anderson ended it WAY to quick. It started off really good, but the ending was crud. I mean One TIe Bomber took out the Knight Hammer, which in opinion is highly not possible. The Knight Hammer was bombarding Yavin 4, and not hitting one thing! the only casualty was basically one Jedi!! Also, killing off Crix Madine was a low blow to the unsung heroes of Star Wars. Anderson, try to put more quality into your books."
3,darksaber is ok,Obi-wan Kenobi is the man he should have been the only person in the book. He should not have died he could have whipped darth vader in a minute. If you liked this book you make me sick. This book would have been better if it was writen by me.
3,It's OK but has some flaws,"This book is entertaining but lacks the great fetures in other Starwars books, like the ones from Zahn, Stackpole and Allston. The Superweapon theme is already boring and the book lacks really good starship battles. But one of the good things is that a big New Republic official finally bites the dust! It is a good read but you can spend your money in a much better Starwars book."
2,avoid Kevin J Anderson like a plague,"Kevin J Anderson is probably the worst author to ever grace the NYT's best seller lists. He's the worst author in the entire Star Wars franchise, and that's allowing for alot of crap. His writing style is atrocious, simply atrocious. His books do not contain a single quote. Not one. Why? because it is written completely in the 3rd person in which character thoughts and dialogue with each other is summarized. It reads like a condensed novel. Ok, here's an example of what Kevin J Anderson would write,""Chewie thought it over. He said to Han that the blaster wouldn't work because of the missing power pack. He sensed Han was mad.""while any half decent author would write something like,""What do you mean the blaster doesn't work!"" said Han""Rrrah rah rah""""Power pack? Huh? Why didn't you say so earlier?""How someone like Kevin J Anderson can be successful writer is beyond me. He has absolutely no writing skills whatsoever."
2,Not a very enjoyable Book :(,"Hi ! I'm a little bit disapointed about this Book, as the Storyline can be easily told. I'd know what would happen 2-3 pages before. So, maybe the story should be a a little more complex. ok, so I won't read this book again, but I'm anxios to get to know others."
5,"Well Written, Well Recieved","Okay, that death star thing is a wee bit too old and used. However, that is ""Darksaber""'s only flaw. Better then it's predissesor ""Children of the Jedi"", this book sucessfully continues the story of Luke and Calista's relationship. It also has the amount of action that I""ve come to expect. Go, Kevin, and keep up the good work"
4,Good until the end,"Anderson starts with all the requirements for a Star Wars novel and even adds depth to the relationship between Callista and Luke, but he moves too quickly. There is a lot of detail left out that adds to the Star Wars universe and the climax is not what I had hoped. Instead of building the tension of the possible use of the Darksaber weapon, Anderson just writes it off. However, the one thing I truly enjoyed was seeing the Jedi Knights use their powers to change the circumstances and not just allow the Alliance to save them. Darksaber is a pretty good novel which follows in the tradition of the Star Wars novels, but it could have been better if made into a trilogy"
1,"Repetitive and boring... Don't bother, you'll quit half way!","Anderson isn't even close to 90% of the SW writers out there! Darksaber was babyish, the Death Star thing was dumb, and to all the good characters are killed. Callista's personality must have gone through a scrambler between Children of the Jedi and Darksaber- since when does she rely on Luke for everything? And if the Jedi Knights can repel 17 Star Destroyers with the force why don't they do something like that in every fight? Darksaber wasn't worth the money at all. Anderson cant write without stealing other authors' characters and either killing them or messing them up!"
2,Quoting the Movies is NOT Writing a Book.,"This is the most unimaginative Star Wars book I have yet read. It's almost like Mr. Anderson was afraid to develop the characters beyond the original trilogy. They don't even use original dialogue half the time! Also, Mr. Anderson has a problem with killing off characters: namely, he can't. Admiral Daala survived against all odds one too many times for me to care anymore, and the way Callista attacks her is crazily improbable. Read the New Jedi Order instead, one of the characters might actually die."
2,Uninteresting,This book really didn't have any meat to it. The overall story line wasn't progressed much and the book wasn't interesting enough to make up for it. It's a quick read so go ahead and take the time. Just don't expect too much.
3,why make another death star?,"Hey you do have to give credit to Anderson he did try. Some of the parts were real good, but did Madine have to die? It was great that Castilla got out of the picture, I didn't like her at all. All in all it was pretty good, but it did have its holes in the story line."
5,A great Star Wars book,"Darksaber was one of the best Star Wars books ever writen. Anderson keeps it moving along at a swift pace, it is one of the fastest paced Star Wars books there is. I loved the charecters of Lemelisk, Durga, Daala, and Anderson did a good job with Zahn's Pellaeon. I don't like Callista much, but that's really Hambly's fault. Oh well, had to include her somehow. The concluding battle of Yavin was probably the best space battle written into a star wars book ever, even better than Stackpole's books. All in all, a great read."
5,Good,"I do not know why everyone hates this book.Okay,some parts were off.But It is the best in the thilogy.Anderson is no Stakepole or Zahn,but he is good."
2,Pitiful attempt at Star Wars mastery.,"Kevin J. Anderson is a decidedly anti-Empire author, which is bad enough. What's worse, the plot simply bottoms out at the end. The Empire is depicted as weak and splintered, and the focus of the whole plot, Darksaber itself, is grossly misused at the conclusion. The reader is truly let down, because the whole worry on the Rebellion's part is unjustified, because it is destroyed before it ever threatens them. Pitiful book, as are all of his others. Don't buy it, but if you have it, spit on it, burn it, and warn others"
4,READ!!!,"There are a lot of mixed feelings about this book, I thought as I read all of the reviews. I think that it was a fast- paced novel showing lots of perspectives of what the characters are feeling. Sure, the Death Star thing does get a little old, but it does make for an interesting story"
1,Not very good,"This is not a good star wars book, I think the author of thisbook is really bad at what he does. You should read THE NEW REBELLIONit is much,much better!"
1,You people make it sound like the Best ...IT IS NOT,"This is bye far the WORST Star Wars book I have ever read!!For one thing I'm not a Anderson fan,and the only good book he has really made is The Illuistrated Star Wars Universe. I totally agree with the one guy who said that the death star thing is old!!People please don't buy this book!!!"
4,"Good book, could be better though.","Darksaber was a fairly good book. i have to say I've read it about three times, but the stuff with Daalah and everything, I usually skip over it just cause it makes no sence. I don't know what grade leval this book is, probably above mine ( 6th ) but i think he could have made it a little more interesting. Also, with Callista dying or going away, jeeze can't Luke haved somebody for a change?"
3,Kinda too mushy,"The book was kinda cool, but way too mushy. Anyway, whenever Luke gets a girl, she either dies or leaves him."
4,Anderson is a great Star Wars Writer,"Kevin J. Anderson is a tremendous writer. I have read the Jedi Academy Trilogy and was very upset. He does not consider the amount of time spent in hyperspace. One second they are at Coruscant the next on a far off planet, sometimes it takes hours to days to get to these places. Other than that i love his work and will continue reading his work"
5,A pretty bad book,As a reader before said the Callista/Luke thing is pretty sick. Why should Luke fall for Callista when there are plenty of other women out there? He shouldn't thats why. Over all if you skip the Callista/ Luke stuff the action is pretty good.
5,4.5... but 5 is good enough,"As a long time Star Wars fan, I have come to apreciate good story tellers. Kevin J. Anderson is one of the better I have ever read. Before you disregard this review know that most under mine ruin parts of the book( I DESPISE that). Anderson always finds a way to keep you wanting more and this book is no exception. Though I can be slightly difficult to follow if you are in a hurry, it offeres a good variaty of characters and some good plot twists. About the people below this one, I will not say that all of the reviews are overly critical, I will just say that too many Star Wars fans expect perfection for them. Now let me say that if you are looking for a good book to sit down and enjoy... KJA does a wonderfull job and I believe this book is worthy of your attention"
1,this book stinks,"boring book. it has too many side plots which make no sense. i tried reading the book but got so bored i couldn't finish.please don't waste your money on this just stick with timothy zahn star wars. this book just stinks.maybe the expanded universe has gotten too expanded. this writer should give it a rest, please!!!"
1,Displeased,"I've only had this computer for a couple of years and I've had nothing but problems with it. First the hose leaked... within a couple months of buying it and I had to shell out more money to get it replaced because I was on a dive trip at the time and didn't want to miss out on diving. I just got back from a week and a half vacation to Cancun and I jumped in the water day one and was surprised to see I was already at 426 ft. Day 2 I was at 26ft standing in the lobby of my hotel and when I got in the water and dove to 95 ft I was still at 0 ft according to my ""reliable"" computer."
2,Guide to prepare you for your first ski lesson.,"Be in good shape and dress warm. WOW THANKS! no, not much technincal help here. OK prep for your first time out. Also, I'm not sure why there's so much advanced info in here. It is a dummies book."
2,"Anecdotal, not rigorous","Fitzgerald favors sweeping statements like ""Wittgenstein was obviously the greatest philosopher of the 20th century,"" and often uses diagnostic criteria that are true of a majority of people, e.g. liking animals, liking music, being creative. For example, the posthumous diagnosis of Lewis Carroll might seem convtroversial, given that the Wired magazine Asperger's quiz, which is 30 questions long, has 2 of those questions focused on the ability to play make-believe (apparently, people with Asperger's tend to lack it). Furthermore, saying that people with AS ""suffered unbearably"" and can do things ""a hundred times better than the average person"" may raise hackles among both AS so-called ""sufferers"" and the general population."
3,"No chapter on Wittgenstein? Then, why keep mentioning him?","He mentions Wittgenstein about eight or nine times in each chapter and yet the man receives no chapter of his own. Why? What was the point in this? I had to go and look up on wikipedia (terribly reliable source I know) to see what all the fuss was about since the book never addressed Wittgenstein yet the author kept making references to him. Aside from this incredibly annoying feature, the book wasn't all that bad and kept me entertained. Once you get past this distraction, it's fairly well written and thought provoking. I recommend it if you can get it for cheaper than about fifteen bucks."
3,unable to find password,"This product advertises that a password can be located on the dvd cover to give the customer access to the ""Quiptionary"" and ""Notable No's"". I have been unable to find this password and have not received any response to inquiries made on [...] Any suggestions??"
5,Took it out the next day...,"This is the best computer I have used to date. I will be attending the online training class to get everything out of my dive computer that I can. It worked perfect, it was very easy to read, buttons are a little difficult to manipulate with 3mil gloves on... back light... well you have to hold the button to get it to activate... but as far as the other funcitons... AWESOME!"
4,Surprisingly good,"I will admit, I very rarely read fiction written by women. It is not a sexist comment, just that I find it difficult identifying with female main characters. However, Ms Volsky does a wonderful job of making her protagonist real, flawed, feminine and interesting at the same time. The book is pure fun, written in a descriptive yet simple prose. Moreover, the prose is so well written that one can easily start reading and then notice they have flown through 100 pages.The book is set in another world where the heroes and villians compete in a race set on a world where the 19th century meets magic, rationalism confronts mysticism. It may be said that this is another ""Around the World in 80 Days"", but there are grander themes and international conspiracies that range throughout the text, political intrigue and adventure. There is more depth to this book than Around the World.This is the perfect book for summer reading and you will not be unhappy."
4,"Soft, cuddly socks","I purchased these socks as a small gift for someone, and they are very well-made, super-soft, and the color is vibrant (I purchased the blue ones). I am very pleased with them, and the response from the receiver!"
3,Soft cozy socks,"These socks are very nice. Soft and warm. However, a hole popped out of the toe seam after a day of wearing. Hadn't even washed them yet. For the price, they should be better made."
1,Garbage,"These are not as shown. They are cheaply made and fall apart easily. The die runs, so wash them by themselves. Cheap knock-offs."
2,Only one pair!!!!,"Socks were great, but I thought there would be more then one pair.....grim sauce. They should advertise that a wee bit more!!!!"
2,Soft and warm Microfiber Fuzzy Socks but.... beware of the Red Lint Monster!,"These socks are warm and fuzzy and warm and comfy. But, beware. I purchased the blue and red ones. I washed them first in a dark wash, and there was blue and red lint all over my other clothes! So everything went into the dryer, and it took two cycles to remove the lint from the clothes. Believing the worst was over, I thought It was safe to wear the socks. I wore the red ones with the white crocs I wear in the house, and still more lint! A trail of lint everywhere I walked. The lint came through the holes of my crocs. When I took my crocs off, the inside of my crocs was red! Haven't tried the blue ones yet...... fearing the Blue Lint Monster!"
2,softoutside but not inside,"pretty, fuzzy socks, but not soft on inside. Felt coarse to soles of my feet."
5,Warm Socks,These arrived just as expected. They were requested as a Christmas present and I am sure the person receiving them will be very happy. There was a quick delivery and they were well packaged. Great business transaction.DC III
4,Nice and Soft,These aren't the biggest but they sure are soft and feel really nice on the feet. You will enjoy these when lounging around the house!
4,Finding Buck McHenry,Great little movie about baseball and some true and some fictionabout what went on back in the 1930's I think would be enjoyed by all ages
2,Not again,"First of all it took 10 days to get it. It would be better for USPS to be privatized with no more pension benefit.Just finished tuning my stereo with 4 speakers and three amps and then this dvd came. Load'em up with excitement. My god, it sounds like Pavaloti caught flu or larynzitis. Something is mis-firing or mixture is too lean. Checked all the amps and wiring but no avail. The picture started as vacuum tube color tv. Blood pressure went up to critical point to trigger hemorrage.Looking at the dvd box with desperation and it says ""mono recording of 1974 performance."" What a relief. Nothing wrong with my stereo and speakers. I should have checked the product description.But this dvd has value for anthropological study. It shows male dominance and Beatles style of hair-do in that era. I might donate this to local library. Ashkenazy is cool though."
1,Not Beethoven,"This guy just can't play Beethoven. He plays Beethoven like B was a Russian composer. The tone here is just not right. Kempf was (and still is, posthumously) the best Beethovenian pianist. Don't waste your money here."
4,More 'work' than 'game' -- but still a valuable CD,"This CD lacks the color and the adventure of the Reader Rabbit CDs, but it makes up for thru it's phonics drills. It's one after another with little talking which is why my children burn out on it fast. I don't see that as a bad thing, tho, as children learn in quick bursts and then like a break from the drill-like phonic questions. Which is probably why they can play Reader Rabbit games for hours because it's less ceribral and more game-orientated.I love Reader Rabbit, and thank god for it, but I like this CD, too. I 'make' my 4 and 5 year old play it a little bit every day and it improves their phonics and then they can play Reader Rabbit afterward as a reward. *G*Worth the money. Helpful. Not a CD you regret buying if better reading and phonics is your goal. But not a CD the kids will be begging to play 24/7."
3,Gunter Noris - 70th Birthday,"Gunter Noris has am amazing collection of Ballroom Dancing CDs available. This is how I got to know his music- dancing competition Ballroom and now playing it for others to enjoy. What many don't know is that before his fame in Ballroom Music, Gunter Noris had a huge following in Germany for his orchestra. I am lucky to have many of his old vinyls before the advent of CDs.- No I am not that old!His music is rich, vibrant and full bodied. This CD has many of the best from his ballroom CDs and therefore are in strict dance tempo for standard dancing. The other non dance tracks are beautiful to listen to and enjoy. If you are just starting out in Ballroom Dancing this is a great place to start for music to practise at home. The only problem with that is, you then have heard the best and it is often hard for others to measure up! All his music is terrific. Heather"
2,Sound Quality Good but Lacks Important Features,The vtech unit looks nice and the sound quality is good. However if you need multiple handsets you might not like this phone. vtech says you can store 50 phone book entries. This is fine but you need to program each handset individually. There is no facility to send your stored numbers to the other handsets. This can be a problem is you have a large phone book.Another problem is if you want to delete a phone book entry. The manual does not tell you how to do that. The manual does tell you how to delete recent calls. I tried that procedure and it worked for numbers in your directory.If you use the single handset model then I would say this is a very nice phone. If you want multiple handsets then I suggest you look to another vendor.
2,Great Phone for 18 Months,"Got the phone from Sam's Club at a great price and it worked well for about 18 months. Then, the ringers on the base handset and another handset stopped working. No matter how much you increase the ring volume on the handset, the ring remains at such a low volume that you cannot hear it unless you hold the handset to your ear. Have completed all the troubleshooting one would need or care to do."
1,What a Dog with Fleas,"This phone consistently loses four hours from the time set after a few hours. Calling customer service received the reaction that they haven't a clue as to this problem, and of course, no solution on the horizon.I expected to purchase a working phone system, not something I could beta test for the manufacturer. I suppose it doesn't matter, they completely ignore email messages and when you reach phone support they have no idea of the problem, let alone a fix.This is a dog with fleas best to be avoided"
2,Nothing beyond looks,"This phone looks great but that is pretty much the only advantage it has.- the DECT technology has many more features that Vtech has chosen not to implement on this phone: expandability, interoperability with other phones, ability to copy the directory to all handset and others.- The microphone of the handsets seems to not work correctly. All my callers say that my voice sounds like coming from down a well, very low and remote. The same applies for all three handsets, so it wasn't just a bad handset.This is unacceptable so I will be returning the phones back and getting another brand DECT phone."
1,"Looks great, terrible battery life","I loved the way this phone looked so I got it. The battery life is TERRIBLE! Only a few hours, even if not in use. We lost one of the handsets, and since it had died I couldn't page it. It's still lost to this day. Now I find out that they are not expandable!!! How terrible! I'm going to order a Uniden like everyone I know suggests. This is definitely the worst phone I've ever owned. Don't let the cool looks fool you."
1,V-Tech rip-off,"Have owned this set of phones for a little over 3 years.All was well till the batteries needed replacing after a year. Called all over this city and found the battery only at one specialty retailer. Got online to the V-Tech site and ordered two of the three (third handset still alive)at a cost of $20 apiece. Less than a year later, the batteries began losing their charge and we keep them on the cradles all the time...very annoying. Now all three need replacing, and do you think I will spend $60+shipping for this junk? HA! What a rip-off!So have just replaced the phones with an entirely different, highly rated brand. Will NEVER buy V-Tech again. What good is a dead phone???"
1,Worst phone ever owned,"Nice looking, sleek design. That's about all this phone has going for it. We've had the phone for less than a year. My biggest issues in order or importance are:1) Battery - 2 of the 3 handsets DO NOT work anymore...battery completely DEAD! Charge on the remaining handset only lasts a few minutes and disconnects in the middle of my conversations, even after being charged all day and night. I'm sure this one will be completely DEAD soon.2) Directory - Numbers stored in one handset cannot be shared between the other 2 handsets. Each handset must be programmed individually.3) Flash button - Does not work. When I have a call waiting, and hit the Talk/Flash button, it hangs up on everyone.4) Customer Service - When I called Vtech, it does not allow me to speak to a person. It prompts me through 100 different options but none allows me to speak directly to a live representative.THE PHONE IS JUNK. I will be replacing it today!"
2,phone battery don't last long,"Clear calls, but battery life in headset don't last very long. Recommend you buy replacement batteries, because the ones they come with won't hold a charge for very long. Batteries cost about 20 bucks a piece."
2,Average Phone,"I agree with many points that other reviewers have made. Overall, the sound quality is great and it is a nice looking phone. However, there are many disappointments:1. No expandibility2. Cannot share phone directory between hand sets3. Poor battery life - our handsets will die in less than a day if left off of the chargerThis will most likely be my last Vtech phone, every time I purchase one there are too many ""gotchas""."
1,Terrible Battery Life,"Phone seems nice, but I haven't gone to the trouble (as others have pointed out) of adding phonebook entries, because we're probably going to return the phones. A fully-charged phone gets the low-batter warning after only a few hours off of the cradle, and will die completely overnight.Since we often leave our phones off the hook during the day, and we have kids that sometimes misplace them, a decent battery life is necessary..."
1,WARNING: DO NOT BUY!,"This is by far the WORST set of cordless phones we have ever had! After only around 6 monthes the phones started malfunctioning majorly. The charge would not hold more than three minutes after being removed from the charger, the phone would say ""UNAVAILABLE"" when we tried to answer it, and after hanging up the phone it would start to ring again for no reason. Thankfully, where we purchased the phone they were able to return it no box, no reciept, no problem. Just make sure that if you choose to buy this phone you go to a reputable store with a good return policy."
4,Nice phone!,"Great sound quality and range. The battery seems to last forever too. You can basically talk on it all day and then re-charge it at night.The phone also ""looks"" great!By the way, you can add the ""1"" before dialing... When viewing your caller-id and you want to add a ""1"" before dialing, press # and it will add the ""1"" and if you keep pressing # it will give you different number options i.e. removing the area code."
3,No Speed Dial,This phone does not have speed dial. It requires you to push so many keys to dial number stored in the phone. The handset does not have any connectivity to headset.The answering system does not have good fidelity.
2,battery does not quit charging,"The battery does not stop charging. Instead, the battery keeps on heating up while charging continiously."
2,quality has deteriorated terribly,"A couple years ago I drank this every day. It was rich with cardomom flavor. When I recently reordered I found that like everything else in this sorry world, the quality of the tea had deteriorated drastically. It is bland and flat compared with the spicey richness of flavor in the past. I wrote to complain; they replied they used the same ""recipe."" It's the ingredients and the process that count--not the recipe! I may have to make it myself."
5,"Good combination for healthy, caffeine free chai",This is a good choice for chai lovers who don't want caffeine in the evenings. Plus you get the health benefits that come with rooibos tea. The taste is great as well.
5,Wonderful with Ginger Crystals,"I love black tea chai but since I'm avoiding caffeine I drink the Rooibos Chai. This is a very good blend given that a red tea blend will never have the richness that the black tea chai has. I love it with a teaspoon or so of ""Honey Ginger Crystals."" Amazon sells them. It gives it the extra spicy ginger kick that I love and a little bit of sweet. Very yummy."
3,Yogi Chai Rooibos,"I ordered Yogi Chai Rooibos because my very favorite Kalahari's Zambezi Red Chai is not presently available. Perhaps if I'd never had the Kalahari product I would rate this chai higher. But for me, it just not as good.The Yogi red chai is pleasant, but rather wimpy compared to the Kalahari. I like a fuller, spicier flavor. Also, be warned, that if you don't like a sweet tea, or you add sweetener to your tea, there is already Stevia in the Yogi red chai. I always add Splenda to my tea and found that this Yogi tea was sickeningly sweet. When I checked the ingredients, I noticed there was Stevia leaves in it. I've since adjusted the amount of sweetener I add.There aren't a lot of rooibos chais around, so Yogi Rooibos Chai will have to do for now. I hope Kalahari will be back soon though."
5,This One Never Gets Old!,"I have owned this movie for two or three years, and I still watch it maybe once or twice a month. It is fast paced, very funny, and full of slapstick humor and cliche'd lines.Very fun, watch this."
5,Top Quality DVD Production,"This is simply one of the finest quality DVD productions I have seen. Even the menus are creatively assembled, organized and presented.There are plenty of behind the scenes interviews with Director, Sonnenfeld, as well as Jones & Smith, special effects wizard, Rick Baker and on and on. There are numerous filmclips of unused footage, special effects takes and re-takes, including blue screen images. You even get the music video featuring Will and ""Mikey.""For anyone who's seen MiB and enjoyed it as I have, this DVD is a marvelous addition to your collection. I would actually rate the DVD quality and value as ""5"" stars and the film itself as ""4 1/2"" stars.By any standards, don't miss this one!"
2,Gets Boring After A While,"I actually would have given this movie two and a half stars. It gets kind of boring after a while. But the movie is still funny. The effects are really improved too.I liked this movie a lot when I first saw it, but I kind of get bored of it now. As mentioned above.This movie is still worth renting for anybody that hasn't seen it yet."
2,Digital copy through amazon was really poor quality!,The quality of the picture was so bad we couldn't stand to watch it! Next time I will just buy the DVD.
1,Great 1/2 movie - Would like to have seen the 2nd half,"Rented this movie - streaming. 1st hr was great. then the movie stopped. had to restart from the beginning.Generally love Amazon, but this was a bad experience."
4,Meb In Black,Meb In Black Eull Screen Single Disc Dvd. Is a good movie starring Tommy Lee Jones And Will Smith. Would recommend to a friend.
1,No good,"I recieved the product on time when I ordered it from GoHastings. I put the DVD away until Christmas when my son opened it. He put it in the DVD player and it froze up at the menu. I took it out and noticed a crack in the disc. I contacted the seller and they said since it has been more than 30 days, there was nothing that could be done. I will not be ordering from them anymore."
3,"""3 stars is really being too kind""","I like Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith, but this movie really wasn't all that good to be honest. I don't think that actors with their reputations should have done a movie this silly."
1,"Nice DVD, lousy film...","Perhaps more than any other film of '97, Men in Black insulted my intelligence. I think the film thought it was terribly clever, and that's what really bothered me about it. The plot is a simple A to B progression with no twists whatsoever. Every scene exists simply to set up one lame gag, however, the problem is that the gags (which are simply a goofy CGI shot followed by a Will Smith witticism(tm) or Vincent D'Ornfrio as a redneck Beetlejuice) are just NOT funny... at all... Speilberg produced this movie, which is odd, since the thing it most lacks is what he provides best : a sense of wonder.The DVD has some great special features, but what's the point if the film included is nearly unwatchable in its garish loudness?"
1,Men In Black was Wack,This movie was so boring. I couldn't believe I flocked to it on the first weeks of it's release. The special effects are good but the story line is so stupid. I recommend this movie to people under 13 years old. If you're older than 13 don't waste your time on this flick. END
1,Man Its Bad,"This movie is god awful. Will Smith should stick to what works for him, action movies with comedy in them (ex: Bad Boys), because he was garbage and so was Mr. Jones. He proved he cant do just regular comedic movies in MIB, and also that Wild Wild West. Buyer beware, this movie isnt even worth a dollar."
1,cheese,"People warned me this movie was cheesy, but I just had to see it for myself. God it sure was. But adleast it wasn't as bad as the sequel."
1,Can you find something really large to gag me with?,"Two men in black suits investigate supernatural sightings by normal citizens and erase their memories if they know too much. Stupid, immature, and crude comedy with dark touches and SPACE JAM humor that isn't worth finishing initial viewing. But I did, foolishly. Nothing more than an excuse for Smith to show off and swear excessively without getting a PARENTAL ADVISORY slapped on him. Worth less than a star."
4,Loved it,This is the best movie of the Trilogy. I loved Vincent Donofrio as the Bug. Too bad agent O was not in that movie
2,Good in some aspects,"This movie was funny, had action, and the DVD had great extras. Why only 2 stars? This movie is far too violent, and includes shots of a man's skin being torn off his body, two disuised aliens being sliced through the neck (and dying), a person having been killed and inprisoned in a slimy green cocoon, an alien jumping off a building to his death, a toe truck driver being shot and killed, several squashed cockroaches, a hose puring out toxic gas was shoved down a man's throat (obviously killing him), an alien being blown apart, a guy's head being shotoff, and, to top it all off, a full shot of a man broken in half at the waist, lying dead with a pale face and his feet by his head, stuffed into a metal shelf, one arm hanging down at his side. I would not reccomend thhis film to anyone who can't stand blood and guts."
2,very average,i would like to see Will show his true acting skills as opposed to doing the jive Eddie Murphy routine.fast talk with little substance.Tommy Lee Jones is a solid actor.i believe they can do way better than this film.
4,MIB Blu-ray,actually somewhat thinkers twice buy blu-ray edition of the MIB is considering the release of version 2 does not exist bluraynya. But because the economic price to be tempted to have it.bluray disc contains a very striking image and transfer there are some dirty spots spots still exist but are not very intrusive.watch this movie memorable for me to remember funny and cool secret agent
2,Overdone!,"Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are great actors, but not in this film. ""Men in Black"" is about as realistic as winning the lottery every day for a week. On the good side, its violence is not to be taken seriously, and it probably is a great family show for those with 6-10 year-old children."
3,Twisty fun actually!,"Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith, two characters I find diametrically different, but yet spar up great in this fast, fun and funky movie.Fast due to its action based material (save the universe!), fun on its humor (Will Smith in a grotesque alien environment) and funky as I never really get the impression I'm watching a movie but more like a stand up comedy show with alien gags in it.Very enjoyable... can be watched a second time!"

4,A really funny movie,"My usual movie fare consists of independent and foreign films and I shy away from the typical big brash Hollywood movie but sometimes everyone needs a good laugh.This is a very funny film that puts a whole new spin on ""illegal aliens"".Part sci-fi spoof, part action movie, the film makes use of a lot of special effects. Some of the forms of space creatures are in and of themselves a riot.The humor ranges from slapstick to the silly to sometimes being surprisingly witty.There are parts of this movie that are laugh out loud funny."
4,A little disappointing.,"This was to replace our DVD, so I already knew it was a great movie! However, the difference between our DVD, and the Blu-ray was not as amazing as I was hoping."
4,Save the world and have a good laugh,"We're used to seeing Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith save the world, but who'da thunk they'd make us laugh while they did it. Great cast of ""real characters.""Turn your reality switch all the way off and enjoy."
3,Trailer was the movie.,"Someone once said- This is the movie that is defined by its trailer... Once you have seen the trailer, you have seen the movie. I think it was me after viewing it for the first time. I bought this movie on reputation and after a single viewing, was very disappointed. But upon further review, since friends would request it, the movie grew on me. The Edger suit bit was just to funny. The constant interaction between Smith and Jones was fun. The bit with the morgue doctor... the flashy thing.In the end, this is a good movie, not great, but recommended.To bad the sequel was bad."
5,Movie,Great gift! Good price on this movie and it was what my husband was wanting. Love shopping online when the price is right!
1,Paid for HD; got SD,"I paid for the HD version of this movie, but Amazon Unbox only allowed me to download the SD version to my PC? What gives?"
4,Men in Black,"Not my type of movie, but it was funny. My husband liked it. we had never seen the series and were planning on watching MIB III on New Years."
5,"Funny then,still funny now",Men in Black series was and is still a very funny series. Glad to see it in my UV collection now.
4,Cld not download,Could not download the last quarter of the movie. That was a major disappointment. It would have been great if I could have had the end of it too.SharonJoy
4,A movie worth watching!,"A very good comedy, Men in Black sheds light on a secret government agency that monitors alien activity.Tommy Lee Jones, Will Smith, Linda Fiorentino (who is HOT!), and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well.The setting, the plot, the music, the humor, and the dialogues are all wonderful!Overall, it is a movie worth watching, and even though quite silly at times, it will surely put you in a good mood!"
1,Don't,"Please, don't waste your money and your time in this video. Will Smith certainly is the worst actor in the world and the film is horrible. Irch!"
1,Just so you know not everyone loves this junk.,It is simply one of the most unimaginable things I have ever seen. It amazes me how people loved this movie.I don't want to waste my time going into detail what I hated about this movie because the film is only indicative of a larger problem.If you don't know what this problem is then perhaps this is the film for you.
2,Men In Black,"It was okay movie. It has some pretty good funny parts. It is a good price for this movie. Buy it, you won't regret it."
4,I think you have wrongly...,I've got this limited edition.I Totally enjoyed the movie and the special features but I think you have wrongly advertised this edition because this edition comes in 2 discs. It is also comes with the limited edition signed poster and the letter from the producer. You guys should be more alert and careful in giving the right information to customer next time.
4,"Good movie, Expecting More From DVD","I was really excited about getting this DVD, but once I got it I wasn't AS much impressed. Don't get me wrong, its a great movie, but some of the features it promised really are not that great. The best part of the DVD besides the movie is being able to see Tommy and Barry MST3k style for visual commentary. Other interesting items is a video about Men in Black and some trailers. Great movie, but not quite too much stuff, even though it comes on 2 discs :)."
2,"Buy the Cheaper version - ""Deluxe DVD"" is a Deluxe DUD!","First of all, the movie is just ""OK"". Smith is pretty good in his role (he should have looked for another role like this instead of trying to be James West in a horrible version of a classic TV show!), and Jones is wonderful (as he has been in almost every role that I've seen him in). The problem is that discs are in cheap packaging, and the supplemental material is really dismal (especially when you see what can be done on DVD's like the recently released T2: Ultimate Edition). After going through the ""extras"" on disc 2, all I could do was wonder what I had just wasted my time on! There was nothing of interest on disc 2 other than wonderful menu graphics (Too bad they didn't pay as much attention to the content as they did the menu! The graphics are really terrific). Save your money, pick up the movie-only disc."
5,OMG,We have been waiting for this movie in blu ray for quite some time. What an improvement. This is a must have.
5,To: Rockisgoodfood,Sorry this is not a review but some info for Rockisgoodfood. You said Columbia Tristar should release a 2:53.1 version of this movie. My question is this.. why would you want to do that? This film is presented in its OAR (original aspect ratio) which is 1:85.1 shot on 35mm film. If columbia Tristar was to make a 2:35.1 aspect ratio of this movie... it would literally have to be cropped and cut. Why would you want that? This dvd is 1:85.1 anamorphic widescreen. You cant get anymore than that without destroying the film. If this film was made 2:35.1 it would probably have the actors heads chopped off and things like that.
3,"Don't call this ""widescreen""","Earth calling Columbia Tri-Star, have you ever heard of 2.35:1 widescreen anamorphic? It's a sham that Columbia would push this 1.85:1 version. That must be why it's a ""Limited Edition"". C'mon Columbia Tri-Star, give us the 2.35:1 version. For those of you who like the ""small screen"", this is your movie. Sorry but I like to see everything the director intended me to see."
3,It was o.k.,"It was funny at parts and exciting at parts but it really doesn't keep you attention that well, I have seen better movie but than again I have seen worse. If you enjoy Science-Fiction/Alien movies you would enjoy it because the story line is quite far out. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones did do a good acting job though."
4,For the parents out there...,"Ok, let's get parental.This should have been a great movie for kids. It's got weird creatures, cool secret-agents, lots of neat ray-gun-type-things. The movie made me want to be eight years old again, so I could sit there wide-eyed, two inches from the screen, and say, ""Awwww... coooooool"". Then I'd spend the next few years playing MIB during recess with all my friends. ""No, I wanna be the coroner!""I say ""should have been a great movie for kids"" because of the language factor. My boys love this video. I love watching it with them. I hate the discussion we have to have before and after about what sort of language is appropriate in my house and why it is Hollywood people seem to find it necessary to fill their movies with junk-talk. It bores me. I'd much rather stare at the tv in awe then head out to the playground with them.HaHa! I erased your memory!! Neener Neener Neener!"
4,not too bad,"Men In Black Deluxe Edition is quite a good buy. This movie basically talks about Tommy Lee Jones training Will Smith to become an agent that deals with aliens. Overall, quite funny. Watchable but the special effects could be better. This dvd has tonnes of extras to keep you awake."
4,First half far funnier than last half,"The first half of MIB is damn funny. Hyperbole is the key to humor here. How can you not laugh at the possibilities presented by unlimited technology? Will Smith is great as the man just smart enough but irregular enough to work as an MIB. Tommy Lee Jones' panface is perfect for his role.The second half kind of devolved into regular, familiar action movie formula, and I started to get a little sleepy. But the first 45 minutes to an hour is very, very unique and interesting.Worth checking out!-- JJ"
3,ha ha. very funny.,"It was an okay movie to waste a few hours in the theater in during the summer. However the humor in this film, was mostly that strained Will-smith style of comedy that tries to be ""cool"" and pretty much fails. Nuff said."
5,Looks too good on blu,This movie looks great on blu-ray sometimes too good that you can notice the special FX look fake on some scenes.
5,absolutely great movie,This movie is well worth watching. We enjoyed it all the way through. I believe this movie could be a good movie for kids 12 and older.
5,Make some popcorn and watch some aliens!,"One of the few movies that I can watch over and over again. Vincent D'Onofrio is great as the ""bug""."
2,"Be careful of the DVD, it may not be compatible w. players","I love this movie and already own the VHS edition so was excited to see it coming out on DVD. I own a JVC DVD player and was very disappointed that it did not play this DVD.I made a trip to my local electronics retailer and we tried it in several DVD players. Sony (of course!) players worked as well as Panasonic and Samsung (go figure!). Yamaha, JVC and Toshiba did not.This is not an unusual occurance, so caveat emptor everyone, try before you buy, something made difficult by Amazon's return policy."
4,"Fun summer flick, excellent transfer","It's a fun movie, even if it isn't a cinematic masterpiece. Just a joy to watch, it's well paced, funny and slick. It has undercover agencies, aliens, and Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones,a nd lots (I mean lots) of jokes and a touch of action and mayhem. Gotta love this classic summer fun flick!The Blu Ray edition is stunning; while some of the special effects didn't age as well as I'd have liked, picture quality and sound quality were both phenomenal, noticeably better than DVD. Colors were crisp, there was minimal grain and noise. Watching this on my 50"" plasma was a total blast. This was hi def done right and a great showcase for the capability of blu ray. I haven't really explored the extras much, but they seem pretty normal--commentaries and the like. Fox should take lessons from this and fix some of their abysmal transfers (Predator, I'm looking at you!)."
5,There back in Black!,"This is a excellent DVD loaded with extras including the music video by Will Smith, storyboards, extra footage, and a sneek peek at Men in Black II! Grat movie, Great DVD."
2,Disappointing,"I'd give this movie 3 stars, but I gave Independence Day 3, so this deserves 2. Will Smith had a few good jokes, but they get old after repeated viewings. The special effects were good, but not stunning. The acting was mediocre, the plot not so great, and overall a failed attempt at a movie that could've been much better. Overall, something I would have given 4 stars when it was first released, but I'm forced to give it 2 now just because it gets old, and very quick. Good for a rental, and that's just about it, I'm afraid. But it did have potential, I'll give it that, and some interesting scenes, but not enough to carry this film."
2,The Nostradamus Prophecy,"This book had a great beginning, but a poor finish. Overall, I thought the author borrowed heavily from Tom Clancy's ""Sum of All Fears"" and ""Clear and Present Danger"". Except for Dubov, the characters were not very interesting. There were some elements that were well written, such as the escape from Cairo. However, the last third of the book had a choppy feel."
4,Crazy people rocking 'cause they want to go more.,"This is the fourth volume in the series chronicling the ""British Invasion"" of rock and roll of the 1960s. It's a good selection of songs this time around, with a nice mix of hits and rarities."
2,small role for MARIA ELLINGSEN,This film is o.k and features the great Icelandic actress MARIA ELLINGSEN from the soaop SANTA BARBARA as the female coach of the Icelandic hockey team.
5,Quack!Quack!Quack!Quack!Go Ducks!,This must b the best video i've ever seen.It is sooooooooooooooo good I completely love it to bits.I had watched the mighty ducks first and then i got this for my christams and i've watched it everyday since.I love it 2 pieces.I can't wait 2 see the mighty ducks 3.It sounds good.I really want 2 see it.The actors are brillant.Adam Banks is cuter than ever.I so want 2 see number three.From what i've read it sounds good.Come on people tell me more.
2,so many mistakes,"The entire mighty ducks series is full of mistakes that inexplicably made it into the movies. in the first movie after banks gets knocked out and taken for xrays hes back on the ice like 5 minutes later. howd that happen? the 2nd movie is even worse. Jesse Hall starts the movie out as a right handed shooter, and then takes his penalty shot at the end of the movie left handed. The same thing happens with adam banks. The one thing that killed me more than all of this was the last penalty shot of the game. Whats with the suspense? if the goal light doesnt go on and nobody sees the puck in the net, what could possibly have happened to it? why does everyone hold their breath wondering if julie stopped it? of course she stopped it! if you want to see a good hockey movie see Miracle."
5,The Ducks are back and tougher than ever!,"D2: The Mighty Ducks reunites most of the cast members and some of the members (in the first movie) are missing like Hans and Charlie's mother. Gordon Bombay who coached Discrut 5 in the first movie (and chagned the name to Ducks) is now playing minor league hockey. Until one player gets in the boards and another player sends him down on the ice injuring his knee. So he heads back to his hometown and reunites with one Duck. And the player is Charlie (Joshua Jackson). But then this man named Tibbs (Michael Tucker) who works for Hendrix shows up and hires Gordon Bombay to coach Team USA in the goodwill games. And the team is the ducks memebers. And some new members are add to Team USA. The new players are Luis (Mike Vitar) who needs to learn how to stop skating, Dwayne (Ty O'Neal), Julie ""The Cat"" Daphne (Colomine Jacobson), Ken (Justin Wong) and Hormnes. Also know as Dean Portman (Aaron Lohr)."
3,what else do i need to say emilio,"not as goood as ducks 1 but a good sports underdog movie, or the common people struggle too, but do overcome the elite powerful group in the end and great for kids entertainment"
5,So practical,"This cart works as a breakfast nook and an island especially when space it tight. The draws aren't that useful because they are small, but good enough for napkins. I loved mine so much i bought one for a house warming gift for a relative who didn't have that much kitchen counter space."
4,A very nice table,Easy to assemble and fits perfectly on our tiny kitchen. A great value for the price. Perfect for occasional or light use.
3,Solid wood,"Solid wood, looks great but would like to have a choose on finish , stain color or paint color ..very small for small spaces"
4,Perfect for studio space :),"I live in a studio with very little space in the kitchen. Having a table to actually sit and eat a meal is SO WONDERFUL. When it's all folded up and set aside, it makes perfect counter space or mobile support when I'm painting.Very good buy :)."
4,Great product for the price,"I was looking for something for my kitchen to set mail and stuff on and also have it double for a small eating space for when we were on the go. This is perfect. It folds, so when it isn't in use it saves space. It is also solid wood which makes it more durable then other products."
3,GREAT BUT....,"great quality table..solid wood.. but sooo over the top small... that really is my fault pay attention to the measurements.. dont just assume use a tape measure bec. I pictured it much bigger.. and for $150. I could have gotten something bigger.. BUT, a nice piece if your looking for a small space saver table that would last you years."
3,Great for a small space,Great for a small space. It's convenient that the stools fit underneath the table to save space. Although the table top had a big crack in it. Not sure if it's due to shipping or if it was cracked before. Very disappointed and there are too many pieces and too heavy to return for a replacement.
1,Where are my insturctions???,There were no instructions. What am I supposed to do now???? Tell me!!! Is there an online version smoewhere? How do you send a package and not the instructions? It's just plain wood to me now.
2,Disappointing defect,"For an inexpensive little breakfast bar for very small spaces, this has potential. Unfortunately the drop leaf portion of the table top on the unit we received had a gap along the side between two boards as well as uneven planing on the edge of the defective board. We feel this piece should have been discarded when it was being manufactured, but it wasn't. That said, if you get one that doesn't have a defective piece, it's probably money well spent as overall it feels pretty sturdy."
5,Breakfast Bar Set - Wonderfully Designed!,"This Breakfast Bar Cart has been perfect for our small guest house kitchen. It looks very nice, the wood is of good quality and does so much for its compact size. The design is wonderful! The price was affordable and much less than some other furniture options. Putting it together took some time and was not easy but was worth it. Many of our guest have complemented this set and so I am pleased with it in many ways!"
3,interesting,I found the directions for this peice to be extremely vague.The stools are not very sturdy neither are they comfortable for an adult over 110 lbs.The stools took forever to be screwed together and after I was finished I realized that I had put the door flap on the wrong side.Again the directions are quite vague.It's nice to sit my lap top on or to use as a bar while having a party though.
4,"Nice, but short","Delivery was fast and the transaction as a whole was smooth. I expected the cart and the stools to be a little taller, but overall it is a nice set for a small kitchen."
4,Overall I am happy with it,"I can only give it 4 stars instead of 5 for two main reasons:1) When assembling it, one set of holes didn't seem to line up. I'm not positive if I did something wrong (although I doubt it), but I ended up having to just ignore the hole and drive a screw straight into the wood.2) It is a not the sturdiest thing on earth. It does wobble a little bit, but not enough to really be a big issue.Overall, very happy with this product. If not for these two things, I would call it perfect."
4,almost perfect,i received this today and it was much smaller than i anticipated. it was simple to put together( female) it took about an hour to assemble. it is solid wood and doesnt look cheap however my 6'4 boyfriend probably wont be able to be comfortable on it ( he says its a preschool table) so beware!!!
4,Cute and easy,"Love this little set! Perfect for a small apartment. Wonderful the way it provides extra drawer space and folds up so compactly ... even the stools tuck into the unit. It was one of the easiest ""put togethers"" I've ever done."
5,just as described,"This product does not dissapoint. It is very sturdy, well constructed furniture that will fit in the smallest of spaces with room to spare."
2,More like a Toy,"I purchased this Item last year but just recently put it together. I had an old breakfast bar that was life size the bar was of a height that felt like a real bar stool this Item seems small and almost toy like. It is just slightly higher then a regular table. perhaps 4"" I am just 6 feet tall and like I said I would have rather have paid more and gotton a grown ups breakfast bar. I use it in my ofice as a storage shelf now...."
4,Great for price SHIPPING NIGHTMERE!!!,"this arrived ok, after putting the whole thing together we got to the very last piece and the wood was broken clean. Called c/s amazon the were great to send another set to take the broken piece out and send the rest back. Problem..... ABF Freight Systems, the compnay that ships all Amazon purchases, will only deliver between 9 am-5:00 pm and MUST HAVE A SIGNATURE TO DELIVER. What are you supposed to do while you are at work? I contacted ABF several times to tell them I would sign a waiver to just put the package on my doorstep and they refused. I will no longer use amazon's standard shipping and use UPS instead. I still 30 days later have not reced my new parts. If you work, better have someone at delivery address to sign for items or you will be charged a ""storage fee"" by ABF."
4,"Great on space, good in a tight workspace","We started a business recently, and due to space constraints, we couldn't have an employee lunch area. This table fit nicely in our kitchen space. We reinforced some of the corners with steel brackets because we felt it may give in the future. The employees love it! They can eat together (2 fit comfortably), and clean up is simple. With everything stowed away, this table has an amazingly small ""foot print"". Its the next best thing to having an employee lunch room."
2,Second try - its okay,"I purchased this drop leaf table and it arrived promptly. The table drop leaf top has been filled in with wood filler 17"" long by 1"" wide. Amazon was great and sent a second unit out to replace defective one.The second unit drop leaf top was defective on the underneath side this time but by a much smaller area so we decided to keep.If want perfect don't bother buying this..."
3,Could be better,This product has a great design and fits great in my small kitchen. I had to drop the rating though because the top was poorly manufactured. It shows signs that it was put together poorly and the error was fixed with putty that is highly visible and takes away from he piece. I'll keep it as is since returning something so big would be such an inconvenience. It does leave me disappointed though.
4,Good value for money,"This is a surprisingly sturdy unit, assembly was not difficult. Looks very nice, and does what we need it to do- serve as a pub table/kitchen island in a small space. I like the way the stools tuck away underneath.The only minor quibble is that the wheels are supposed to lock, so the table doesn't roll when the cats jump on it- and this feature doesn't work too well. The wheels do move a bit, and the table does get repositioned. But we can live with that-especially at this price!"
1,Broken pieces,"After I opened the box, I found two broken pieces and I was trying to find a phone number to call on the installation manual. Unlike other furniture companies, they don't have a phone number you can call to replace the broken pieces. Instead, they only have a fax number. To my great inconvenience, I had to use a fax machine in my friend's house to fax them the sheet with my phone number and email address. But I have not heard from them since then. I just hate to deal with a company like this who would like to keep their customers in the dark if there are issues with their orders."
5,Great for our cabin!,I love this table. It was really easy to put together. It folds out to be exceptionally large for as compact as it is. I would definitely purchase again.
4,Very good product for the price,"I bought this for my daughter when she moved into a tiny apartment. My daughter's boyfriend put it together so I can't comment on how easy/hard it was. It is very sturdy and looks really nice in her apartment, perfect size!! The one problem is that the top does not attach to the base. I'm not sure if her boyfriend didn't put it together correctly or what, because I see no other complaints about this?"
3,Broken on delivery twice.,"I can't tell you how this kitchen cart worked because we never got it assembled. First time we unpacked it we found the top-table portion cracked in half, so we had to send it back.Received the replacement and the same thing occurred. I guess it was never meant to be. I don't know who/what's to blame... whether it was the packaging, product quality, or if it was due to mishandling of the delivery personnel.Just be cautious of this purchase."
4,Great for small spaces,Easy and fast to assemble and very sturdy.This is just what I needed to provide myself with some extra working space in my tiny apt kitchen.
4,Good for the Price,"This is a pretty nice breakfast bar. I got it on sale and it was shipped from amazon right away. Assembling it was a pain but it wasn't overly complicated. The worst part about assembling it was using the tiny glue bottle. Also, the little stoppers that you are supposed to put on the side of the drawers (so they don't fall out) don't really stay in place. The screw-hole covers don't like to stay on either, but that's to be expected. All in all, once it was assembled it looks very cute and compact. I like how it has wheels so I can easily convert it from the small breakfast bar to the drop-leaf table."
3,Great idea built with decent quality,"I bought this for my studio apartment a few months ago. While it solves the dilemma of limited countertop space in my studio it is not without it's faults. It is made out of decent wood but many of the pre-drilled holes are slightly off which makes for a pain when putting it together. Also, the misaligned holes means that the drawers don't slide out as effortlessly as they should. Lastly, the provided pegs meant for covering the screw holes constantly fall out since they are too big. But overall this thing serves it purpose and doesn't look too bad. With a little trial and error during it's assembly it can be made to work without a hitch. I wouldn't mind recommending this to someone with a small space such as mine but it's definitely not perfect."
5,jamming table,"This table went together easy,it perfect for my little kitchen. When it's folded down I use it like a floating island. It's perfect for my son and me. Would recommend to anyone."
4,perfect for us,"We have a decidedly NON-eat-in-kitchen; it is an old, small and awkwardly laid out space that is separate from the rest of the living space. We also have two small children who still require a lot of supervision. This little table allows me to bring one or both kids into the kitchen for little projects or even snacks while I am working in the kitchen. It is small enough to tuck away when not needed and still small enough for both kids to sit comfortably and safely away from the stove.The set was easy to assemble(although I do have a sore thumb from that darned hex wrench!)and did not have any defects. I feel badly for those folks who reported to have faulty sets, and count myself as plumb lucky. I think at this price point, you take your chances. The table set is what it is(cheap flat-pack furniture), but for our purposes it is perfect.Btw, I ordered this table set via Amazon Prime and it was delivered in two days. Hooray!Best of luck!"
5,Depression: Out of the Shadows,"A book for all to read who has or knows anyone who has mental illness. A great watch, I recommend to everyone!"
2,Not my favorite one.,"An older version, ""The New American Roget's College Thesaurus in Dictionary Form"" is my all-time favorite. But I thought it was time for a more recent edition. Very disappointed in this LITTLE book. Be sure to note the dimensions; it's amazing what an inch or so (or lack of) does. The new version is printed on a grey stock with small type and is hard to read. I also wish they'd kept the basic page numbers. It's an excellent resource and I use a thesaurus often in editing, but this is not one I reach for because of these ""small"" things."
5,teresa rocks,this movie is what we want simple yet compelling stories that tell us there is something deeper.
3,Mark Harmon saves the day,"Mark Harmon's acting is the saving grace for this disjointed and somewhat bizarre movie. One of the problems with this movie is the jumping from one situation to the next, with no iota of sense that it's even realistic to follow in that train of thought.Another problem? how do you get from a presumed dead/now missing husband, to a vision/dream that has haunted you for a year?and better yet, how do you get from a weak/recovering from a head injury to being possessesed in a negative way - that's supposed to be from a ""Godly"" vision?Please!as I said, Mark's portrayal of what was obviously a tough role to play, saved the day on this one.If you aren't a fan of his - pick another movie."
3,A Have To Have for any Mark Harmon Fan.,"Mark's acting in this movie-literally saves this movie.The only reason I was able to watch it thru to the end was because of the quality of his performance in this role.the movie itself was seriously disjointed and unbelievable in storyline.When you take a story that is seemingly about 1 thing, infidelity in what appears to be a perfect marriage, and the ""fessing up"" to the unsuspecting spouse and take that line and jump to an exorcism type story line as the reason for the strange things happening to a person; who is recovering from being severely injured/presumed dead, it makes for unbelievable.I was hugely disappointed in this storyline's progression. However, I was more than inpressed by Mark's performance. As one of over 30 movies he has done, I've never been disappointed in his acting yet."
5,very good drama,"I really liked the plot and directing and acting in this movie.I thought this was one of Ms.DeMornay's greatist dramatic roles I've seen her in.No corny bimbo performance here, great dramatic acting combined with good soundtrack and storyline! It has mystery,intrigue,romance, and spice! I'll even use a word I don't usually use and say the ""lovescene"" playing in the snow and flashing back and forth was the best I've ever scene in a movie! Ms.DeMornay is underrated and all the nude scenes I've seen of her are classy and in good taste, unlike other actresses!I'd prefer her to keep her clothes on myself because of all the morons out there who only get off onTV nudity because no real women wants anything to do with them! Again she's a great actress! Keep making movies Rebecca, I'll watch them even if on a viewfinder!Your the best!"
2,Aghast,"I knew going in, when I saw that DeMornay was the exec producer of this film, that this was going ot be good. Good, as in the thrill of bearing witness to a train wreck.Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD) is a controversial diagnosis. Some of the worlds top shrinks don't believe in it and neither will you after watching this film.Watch this film only if you enjoy being a spectator at car wrecks or watching amputees jump from a burning hospital.That millions of dollars were wasted in order to pinch this loaf off is the only believable crime you will see in this film."
1,Just Plain Awful,"There is only one word that can fit this movie--bad. For lack of nothing better to do and no good movies left at the video store, I rented this one night. Mistake! The acting was atrocious, the script worse and the score left much to be desired. The only reason this movie seems to have been made was to have a showcase for Antonio Banderas and Rebecca De MOrnay to have sex. While I am usually a fan of Antonio Banderas, even he seemed lackluster in this movie, as if he were bored with his over-cliched role as biker Tony. Rebecca De Mornay tries and tries, but her performance is flat, and overdone. Also, the stalker is predictable to anyone with half a brain and the edning is so overdone and ludicrousI spent 20 minutes laughing. Watch this movie if you really want, but don't say i didn't warn you!"
1,"A movie to endure, not enjoy","I cannot remember another time when i actually suffered through a movie, but this one was almost unbearable to watch for me and company. The dialogue is cliched and horrendously bad, the acting is poor and forced, and the story utterly, irredeemably awful. It is full of lame suspense-thriller gags that have been used perhaps 100 times prior to this one. The movie also has one of the worst conclusions of any movie in the past 30 years at least-- all of us were shaking our heads and laughing, a bad thing since this is not intended to be a comedic film! De Mornay and Banderas have done vastly better work than this, and if you catch this film it will spoil your opinion of both of them."
3,The Good & Bad,"This thriller is a bit rough-edged, but a lot of people like that sort of thing. Rebecca DeMornay was the at the top of her game around this time (early to mid '90s).On the plus side, this is an interesting and involving story, especially in the second half of the film. The movie is capped by a surprise ending I defy anyone to guess correctly. There are a few steamy scenes, too.The bad news is that there are no likable characters, too much profanity; a few minor holes in the story; and an obvious as sexist bias against men. DeMornay's foul mouth and morals are pretty rotten for a psychologist, the character she plays. The guys, played by Dennis Miller and Antonio Bandaras, are pretty sleazy characters, too."
3,Needed product,"This book was required for my English class in college. I ordered it as soon as school started and expected to get it two weeks later; this is when we would have used the book, and the maximum time limit that it would take to be delivered. I ended up getting the book a full week later and was forced to make copies in the library. Now my final statement is, the book id helpful for your English skills BUT BUY IT FROM ANOTHER WEBSITE OR SELLER."
3,Not a successful mix,"The whole story of Kadare's novel turns around the following question: Did the deceased brother of Doruntine bring back his sister as he promised to his mother?It is not a totally convincing book, although it touches fundamental questions, like socio-biology (incest and exogamy), religion (the battle between the Christian and Orthodox Churches - the resurrection) and politics (the creation and survival of his home country Albania).Neither the mix of the themes nor the outcome of the story did really convince me. His solution for Albania - to base the whole society on 'oaths' - seemed to me rather nave. The general impact of certain facts on the whole population or on certain powerful groups was also more or less exaggerated, even if the story is situated in the Middle Ages.But still a worth-while read."
3,Medieval Mystery,"Albania has always intrigued me as a country. It's continued existance as a Isolationist, Stalinist, Islamic European nation well into the latter half of the 20th Century left it in a class by itself. When I learned that there was a talented writer from Albania with the name Ismail Kadare, I started reading his works.""Doruntine"" is a mystery from the Medieval days of Albania. A woman is returned to her native village from a distant location and no one knows who brought her. The near-comatose woman explains that it was her deceased brother who escorted her. The local police chief is charged with unravelling this bizarre situation. In the course of this short novel there is a fair amount of insight to the local culture and the theological issues of the day. It's a good book but not what I would call a great book. After all, I've read better books by this same author."
3,Gothic!,"P.D. James pulls out all the gothic stops. I sometimes wondered whether she was parodying the gothic genre. The characters and dialogue are unrelievedly morbid, but with a certain amount of depth. The plot is sort of slow. This is the second gothic novel set in Dorset I have run across recently (the other is Ex Libris by Ross King). I shall never visit Dorset. I liked this novel enough to finish it, but I don't think I will read any more P. D. James. Her detective is too introspective, sensitive, and filled with self-doubt."
3,predictable but readable,"I enjoy reading mysteries so that I can be surprised by the characters' actions or motives. This novel has very few surprises. Yet, because PD James is such an excellent writer, I enjoyed the novel because of the detective. His thoughts were interesting and surprising. I wish the action had been too."
3,BLEAK AND SOMBER TALE,"Adam Dalgleish is back in this well written, though ultimately depressing and bleak thriller. Recuperating from a near-death illness, Adam is summoned to a small village by an old friend, a priest named Father Michael. However, when he gets there, his old friend has died of a heart attack, and Adam finds himself involved with a hospice for the young disabled, i.e., terminally ill patients. James serves up a host of pathetic, sad creatures and as usual, a cast of mostly unlikeable characters. Dalgliesh serves more as an observer than a detective, since he is having his own crisis of whether to retire or not, but he nonetheless manages to investigate a series of deaths that may or may not be murder.James continues her mastery of atmospheric tension and the culprit's identity is expertly hidden until the end."
4,A Captivating Final Act,"The gloomy tone that pervades this novel which seemed to turn a lot of people off was actually what I found interesting. The Inspector, recovering from an illness goes to visit an elderly priest who is a family friend at a home for people with degenerative diseases. When he arrives he's informed that the priest has died, but Dalgliesh begins to wonder if it was natural or murder. My only complaint with the story was partially to blame on my own attention span: Many of the suspects began to bleed together, and my inability to consume long passages at once left me looking back to keep the characters straight in my head. As a result I didn't find the book as absorbing as some of her others. Yet at the same time, the final forty pages was some of the most suspenseful of anything I've read thus far, and Dalgliesh's personal struggles throughout the book gave a human dimension to the character that up to now hadn't been seen."
2,"OK, but not great...","I did sort-of like it, but the bouncing back and forth between perspectives got to me this time. I didn't like many of the characters, and came very close to setting the book down. I pushed through, though, mainly to get to the next book in the hope that it would be better. The mystery plotline was ok, but not great - sort of anti-climactic, actually. Eh. Not one of James' better mysteries."
3,none more black,"Death-obsessed even by murder mystery standards, I don't think this novel was as cozy as I wanted. Nonetheless, it's morosely insightful stuff on its own terms. Hero Dalgliesh--which sounds like ""dog leash"" when I say it and is thus a nice name for a cop--is announced to be terminally ill but turns out not to be, then heads out to help a friend and finds his raison d'etre again, after getting past the lurking, morbid, allegorical Black Tower. I read this at a depressive point in my life, and I think the existentialist approach was probably good for me.--J. Ruch"
3,"A mystery novel about mysterious murders in Dorset, England.","Being the first of the P.D. James novels I have read, I was taken at once by the depth each character in this mystery. The psychological aspects of The Black Tower delve deeply into the human soul. The true culprit of the murders remains masterly hidden until the end, but it was disappointing to not be able to figure the mystery out myself. Throughout the novel, clues are dropped that point to almost every character and although some lead to dead ends, Commander Adam Dalgliesh traces them to the end. It was nice to have a conclusion that was both exciting and tied up all the loose ends. I give this book three stars because of the length of time it seemed to take to get to the conclusion."
3,"Unusual, interesting and kept my interest to the end.","As a native Dorset resident, I found it authentic and compelling. It didn't keep me up at night."
5,Perhaps the Greatest Film Ever Made,"And easily the best of the nineties. I've heard people using excuses such as ""It's too long"" or ""It's a documentary"" or ""It's just a sports movie."" Well it is a documentary, but I've seen two other documentaries (""Roger and Me"" and ""Hearts of Darkness"") that rank among the finest I've seen. ""Hoop Dreams"" encompasses not only basketball, not only the ghettos, but life itself. We see ups and downs, successes and failures, and because we know it's all real, the film affects us tremendously. Its length is no factor. When the Gates or the Agees make bad decisions we cringe, when they gain succeed we cry (literally.) No other film has such an incredible impact emotionally and intellectually. This film will change your life."
5,Hoop Dreams,"I'm not sure what it is about this movie that touches me so deeply, but I could watch it a hundred times over."
2,DVD Hoop Dreams,"Did not end with a Bow! I love sports movies, but this one did not hold my attention."
5,HOOP DREAMS STILL ALIVE,"Simply put, this is the best basketball movie ever made... and in my opinion, the best documentary ever.I am looking forward to the follow-up sequel to see what happened to Arthur and William.This movie is absolutely brilliant, and couldn't have been better if it was written. Everyone should view it, if not own it.FIVE STARS."
5,The greatest movie i have ever seen,"This was quite simply the greatest movie that I have ever seen. I found it moving and very entertaining. Growing up in Chicago, its a shame but the NBA truely does seem like the only way out of the ghetto. This movie is a story of basketball, and life. Also it is about a shameful system where your nobody if you dont succeed in the NBA. Perhaps William Gates said it best when he said, ""Sometimes people tell me, 'When you make it to the NBA dont forget about' sometimes i think, 'Well if i dont make it dont forget about me.'"""
5,Very good documentary,"The Bottom Line:Hoop Dreams is not the best movie of the 90s nor one of the best movies of all time (some scenes should have been edited out to make the middle portions drag less, and the narration is often clunky) but it's a well-made documentary and a portrait of America that deserves to be seen; you don't need to be a liberal or a basketball fan to appreciate the power of the story.3.5/4"
4,Persuade,"If your looking for the perfect book, Hoop Dreams is it. Hoop Dreams shows you how hard work and effort can let you fullfil your dreams. This book could change your life if your an open minded person. Hoop Dreams will give you a sense of pride and commitment. I strongly recommend reading this novel, so you can experience its greatness."
5,very tight Documentary,I went to see this Film at the Movies&it was very moving.it showed two Cats who were going for the Gold&leaving nothing for chance. this is a documentary that shows about How hard Cats work at doing what they want to do.still a very Moving Picture.

5,"Romantic Bach, but the Best Ysaye","A little too romantic for the Bach and Mozart for some ears, but still wonderful interpretations. The Ysaye is worth the recording alone."
3,MOVIE TALK:WHO SAID WHAT ABOUT WHOM IN THE MOVIES,VERY GOOD READ. WHO SAID WHAT SHOWS WHAT SOME ACTORS REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT THEIR CO WORKERS AND OTHERS. GREAT INSIGHT INTO THE REAL PERSONALITIES OF THESE ACTORS/ACTRESSES AND OTHERS. WELL WORTH THE TIME AND MONEY.
3,Better price elsewhere,"Nice, simple piece. Wal-Mart sells this unit for $99.00 though on their website."
3,shipping,Notice they charge $25 = .38 per pound but the weight is conveniently left out of the description! I don't like not know how much it will cost to ship..
1,This book holds no water,"This book is merely a sales pitch written by PwC executives looking to drum up e-business sales. It is full of ""e"" cliches and flies in the face of accepted business theories -- such as transaction cost economics. This type of thinking by top PwC partners is clearly the reason why that firm is currently merging with IBM Global Services."
4,It's highly knowledgeable and interesting,"I would recommend this book to any one who is very enthusiastic to know about what eMarkets are, how they are shaping the world of today and, how they are going to transform the way live, eat and play on this planet tomorrow. The authors bring to the reader the complex business models and the corresponding intricate e-Business strategies, in a readable comprehensible manner. The explanations are very clear and the subject is presented in a highly effective manner, using case study approach. I would recommend this book to any e-business strategist. I believe, this book has lot to give for the people who are in quest of knowledge, and who could effectively put into practice, effective and proven e-business models.However the text, is little small and it would have been great if the authors would have taken significant effort in adding more material and integrating the contents.thankyou amazon for the opportunity to let the world know of my thoughts...."
4,Not bad,"Well this book gives a great moral diatribe about Yoga and religion in general, but falls a little short on clear instruction on the techniques. It does however, contain the mantras for each chakra, some visualization for each, and an execellent gallery of paintings to meditate on for each chakra. What I don't like about the book is how he goes on and on about how it relates to Christianity...this is definatley written from a christian perspective.... Also, reading the instruction on some of the breathing excercises is confusing...there is not a clear algorithm given, I would have given this 3 stars, but the paintings might make the book worth purchasing if just for that. Overall a great book for someone who knows nothing of the subject matter. - Adam"
2,Unmemorable,"Though I found it commendable that the author was attempting to share a more subtle way to awaken Kundalini, I found this book truly unmemorable. It was particularly frustrating to be engrossed and reading a passage and then be told, ""pause and put the book down..."" I suppose what I wanted was a more traditional format: text and explanation chapters followed by practical excercises. Perhaps I was also anticipating a more advanced book. The exercises seemed very elementary to me; nothing particularly special that I hadn't read before. And moreover it rang a bit ""self-helpy"" in its style."
1,book review,Anybody who tells you the easy ways to awaken your chakras and have a easy time of it is flat out lying.Chakras can be compared with nuclear bombs in there intensity.Kundalini lightning.Read gopi krishna and muktanandas autobiographies for genuine info.Purify thyself safe and slow. Make alot of good karma.When mind is near pure let nature do the transformation.Never try to force a awakening or listen to someone who says its easy.Very dangerous
4,what i was expecting,"The book came in a pretty decent condition, readable and very affordable at it's used price. What I was expecting from a used book, but it was still in a better condition from what I was expecting. Thanks!"
2,just not good,"I know... there are a lot of great reviews for this book, but it really was not helpful for me. I thought that Doug spent more time talking about himself than he did about what the people (you and me) are looking for. The insight at times was interesting, but as I would get back into the book... he was just talking about himself again.I have found the book, Sustainable Youth Ministry, by Mark DeVries to be very engaging, and helpful for me and my youth ministry team. I think it is much more worth your time. Hope you find this helpful... I am a music and youth director in Naples, FL. [...]"
4,Michael,"If you are thinking of going into youth ministry as a profession, and the first three chapters don't change your mind, keep reading. There is a wealth of information to help your personal life as a youth minister in this book. If you read it once you will read it again!!!"
1,Disappointed,"I'm another buyer of this product who regretted the purchase. D Link makes excellent routers and I assumed all of their products would be of equal quality and service. Wrong!! Despite what you read above, the product simply doesn't work and the technical support staff is even worse. I tried to use this with two 2006 late model Dells, one with a dongle and one with a built in bluetooth card. While the DBT 320 was recognized by both systems I could never get anything to print. Technical support was limited to reading to me what is included in the box and they could offer no other info or help whatsoever. I know more about the product than they did. This was a complete waste of time and effort. If D-Link spent as much time in troubleshooting their product as they did in writing advertising releases, it would have been a better experience. This is going back!"
4,A good collection.,"This is an average collection of stories by John Patrick. If you own any of his other books you know what to expect with this one. The stories are sexy , fun and light. If you do not own any of John Patrick's books,this is a good place to start. If you enjoy this book, you should also pick up a copy of Huge 2 and Wild and Willing. My only problem with this book is that it feels too short. An extra 5 0r 6 stories would have been great."
5,The Fifth CD in an unbeatable series,"The British Invasion/ The History of British Rock/ Volume 5 : Rhino did a superb job in the creation of this series of CDs. Sure, the Beatles and the Stones are who you think of when the British Invasion is mentioned, but this series concentrates on the OTHER great groups of the time. Yet volume Five even has two very early recordings by (or with) The Beatles! Here you get a Ton of hits (and a few forgotten artists) in an extremely entertaining collection. Volume Five covers 20 more songs from 1964 and 1965. When is the last time you heard ""Baby please don't go"" by Them, or ""I only want to be with you"" by Dusty Springfield? Highly Recommended."
3,"Fun, but not as good as the first four.","The thing about the previous novels was that Green's really produced a number of quirky short stories, loosly tied to overall theme. They didn't make a lot of sense, but they were great eye candy. In Deathstalker Honer, he spends the first three hundred pages bringing it all together. Why bother? The final 200 pages return to his usual style, making the book worthwhile.Also, what is with the cover? It is definitely not from this book."
3,I think we could have done without this one...,"As a supreme fan of the Deathstalker series, I have to admit that this chapter really added nothing. With the exception of the 2 alternate Hazels (very well done) there were no new characters and no new plots. The few ""half-plots"" (e.g. the various trips to Shubb and BB's death) were not as crisply defined as in previous books in the series. Can't wait tho' for the wind-up in Destiny."
5,Another Fun Read,"Havin read this book for the third time(I've reread all the books in the series so I'll be pumped up for the last one)I will say that some errors were made, but nothing that I couldn't figure out. I wonder if he does them on purpose to see if he can catch us off guard or something. There are times when the humor in it would make me crack up, and my friends look at me funny. I loved it! Kick ass Owen!!"
5,Not just a Nostalgia Piece,"Sometimes books like this remember better than they read. Not this one. Very much like Sydney Taylor's ""All-of-a-Kind Family"", apart from the old-time setting, the book is remarkably fresh and really sort of timeless. And there's not a single phony or awkward line in the book.All of the children are interesting and authentic. The adventures and situations involve classic elements of responsibility, family affection, loyalty, honesty and similar virtues. But the kids are not stuffed shirts; they act and think like kids, make good and bad decisions like kids, worry and mess up like kids, and have fun like kids.Because each chapter stands alone this is a great book for bedtime or quiet time reading. The stories are fun, they have mild but engaging humor, they are not message laden but they are subtly positive. You could easily read one or two and then lay the book aside for another day.So, a good choice for a kinder, gentler alternative."
4,Lots of Creative Trouble,"I read The Moffats for a book report for my class []. Even though the Moffat family get into lots of trouble, they end up having a good time anyway. The book reminds me of the Great Brain series because they use a plan to outwit...sorry, can't give it away!Read this book; you'll like it!"
4,a winner in the third grade,"I ran across a reference to E. Esthes and The Moffats which brought back memories.Memories of the third grade. And that was a long time ago - I'm well into my 60's.Our teacher used to read us a chapter every day - before we started the afternoon.I remember looking forward to hearing what happened next. We all sat, rivited bythe excellent story telling voice of Mrs. Flynn and the Moffats. Such a wonderfulmemory to have. Do grade school teachers still read out loud? I hope so.Now I'm gong to order a few of those books!"
4,Wow! Amazing book!,"Wow! I loved this book! Between Jane being in a bread box, to Rufus getting on the freight train car. I think that everybody will like this book if they read it. When I started this book, it was like I couldn't put it down. I would read it like 2 hours a day, and I only was required to read 30 minutes for school! I loved it! Now I'm starting to read all the sequels to Eleanor Estes' fantastic books. I'm telling you, READ THIS BOOK!"
2,Too many extras,"We bought this coffee maker a few months ago and were very pleased with the quality of the coffee. However, the water filtration system is messy, and the filter door has too many latches and moving parts. One of the clips that locks the swinging filter into place broke off, and now that entire mechanism does not stay in place properly. The carafe is also awkward to position correctly with the spout facing the back of the machine.Go for a simpler model, with fewer pieces to break."
1,Cheap cheap cheap,"This product is remarkably poorly made, and makes lousy coffee to boot. It has no small serving control, and thus the water races through, the result being weak, thin coffee. The water filter is a cheap gimmick, and on mine, a 2 cent metal retaining device broke, resulting in the entire machine becoming effectively useless. Capresso is clearly a marketing company, not a coffee maker company. Save your money; you will be better off with any other coffee maker."
3,Wanted white and they only showed black on sale...,"I just received this item today. Sept.28, 2001. I paid shipping and now your ad says free shipping. I think you should refund my shipping charges.....Only used this machine once , so can't voice an opinion yet....Douglas kennedyWanted white and they only showed black on sale. Today they show white also on sale . What's going on???"
5,Great tire for a hard to find tire size,This tire worked great for our sons bike which actually called for a 14x1.95 size which is not to be found except for companies located in China. Shipping was quick and I received it within a week of ordering. No complaints with the product or the company that purchased from.
3,great tables- came missing 2 screws,we love the tables but it was a major problem to find replacements for the 2 screws that were missing and are not normal everyday kind.
3,phone stand,Easy to put together but the finish and stain were not uniform. This served my purpose because it fit perfectly in the small space that I had.Made of all wood so should hold up well.
3,Good value,"I am using the two biggest tables together as an end table, which works well and looks nice. The smallest one is sort of too small to be helpful."
4,Pleasantly Surprised by the Quality,This item was easy to assemble and the quality was really nice. I was very happy with this purchase as it is hard to find any decent end-tables in local furniture stores.
1,disappointed in woods on table tops!,"I was very disappointed in the table tops...2 of the 3 are very marred, and i wrote the factory saying that 2 table tops needed replacing and i have not heard back from them. the tables were easy to put together, but the quality of the table tops was very disappointing. i wish they would replace the 2 tops, and then they would get a much better review!"
2,SCRATCHES & GOUGES,"Rec'd these tables quickly, & found them to have numerous gouges & scratches. I decided not to spend add'l money to send them back. I refinished them, & they look o.k. Don't like having to pay for something new to find i had to refinish them!!tammy"
2,Part of assembly impossible,"My nesting table set of 3 arrived perfectly, and the finish on all pieces was just fine. The largest and smallest tables fit together nicely, but one leg on the middle table had its bolt insert way off center, which prevented assembly (we threw it away). Still a good value, I suppose, but defnitely flawed."
2,Eck,Not really loving this piece. It was quite easy to put together but the finish and stain is not uniform. Mine is down right tri-colored the finish is so uneven. There are also two major imperfections on top that appear to be ink stains (probably drops of stain). I also purchased mine to fit in a small place and it fits perfectly but the uneven finish is really noticable and makes it look cheap. My other issue is the drawer. There is no bottom support so when you pull the drawer out it slants downward. I do love the fact that it is solid wood. More than likely this will be stripped and re-finished to match another set of tables I purchased with a perfect finish.
2,Not worth the price,"Table looks like on the picture, so I guess meets the expectation. However, legs are not equal in length (I had to use a layers of cardboard under one leg), the bottom shelf didn't fit perfectly into space provided (there are spaces in between some legs and the wood itself), drawer is wobbly, and I couldn't screw in one of the screws because the holes prepared to tight top of the table with the rest were not lined up. I would not recommend this table and its not worth even half of the price."
5,Great bargin,This is perfect for a small spot. Easy to put together. Really a nice piece for a small kitchen or hall.
1,cruddy but cute,"This is a nice looking piece of furniture that fits well in a small space (why I bought it).But it is a total piece of crap.One of the two legs arrived looking like a shark had taken a bite out of it. Wood was all bent and splintered. The top portion with the drawer (comes as one piece) had a crack in it, one of the drawer supports askew, and the crosspiece separated by a half a cm on that side.So, if you don't mind returning a bulky item when it arrives broken, or would like to buy a piece of junk, get this.BTW, the item seemed packaged securely, so I don't think the damage happened during shipping."
4,Perfectly fit the need!,"These table were just what was needed. My Mother is living in a small space, we needed tables for when people visited and needed a place to put coffee or tea. These tables are perfect! One table was used to provide a base for a small Christmas tree. They are attractive and solid, and they tuck away nicely. I highly recommend this product."
2,Excellent tables but awful finish,"These tables are basically a great product for the price. They are made from real wood (beech) and are very sturdy and well-designed. The only problem from my perspective was the finish. It is not the reddish brown one sees in the photos, but rather a dark walnut that is almost black. The largest table was also badly marred with various scratches and defects. Some people might find a dark finish appealing, but I didn't, so I immedately got out my orbital sander and stripped the tables down to bare wood. I then refinished them using a nice wood stain, topped by polyurethane. They now look fantastic. Incidentally, I wanted to give them four stars, but the website somehow assigned two stars."
3,Very Sturdy; Uneven Finish; Dirty,"These are hardwood tables. Easy to assemble. Nicely machined corners. Sturdy assembly hardware.All three not square on bases. Well stained, but very poorly varnished. After cleaning and oiling, the finish remains uneven one one (the big one that sits on top).All three needed cleaning, not just soap and water, formby's and old english before these were presentable.Very sturdy, well designed. For a casual room or patio IMO."
4,Nice little desk,"This is a nice little desk for the money. The only thing I didn't like about it was that none of the 20+ pieces were marked when I went to put it together. Had to scrutinize the instructions to make sure I had the right piece. The finish is nice, and no damaged pieces."
5,An awesome gift,"This was purchased as a gift for someone, and it was considered one of the best gifts given. The recipient had wanted to brew their own beer for some time, so the gift was greatly appreciated."
4,Surprisingly Good!,"I bought this just for fun, but the quality of the beer was surprisingly good. So much so that I have ordered refills."
4,Good way to check out brewing.,Well I have had my mr. beer for about a year and I use it all the time. The standard recipe kits are so so. I have moved on to using my own recipes. I really like the size of the kit. I have a 5 gallon set up but I live in an apartment so its too difficult to use it. The mr. beer fermenter looks cool but the oblong shape is a pain. It would be better if it were round with a larger opening. A real air lock would be nice too. Still though this is a good way to see if brewing is for you without buying expensive equipment.
5,great gift,bought this for my sister's birthday and she loved it (although her first batch was bad). planning on getting it for my brother and dad too. it's great for getting your own ingredients from a home brew store and using the container to ferment.
4,Wonderfull kit,"this is a nice product, lot's of different options of flavors. You can make your own flavor or follow their path, I would recomend to experiment only after you brewed their stuff a couple of times.The only bad thing is instructions, nat as clear as i expected as a begginer, but they have much more stuff on their website."
2,Fun to do but not that great,"This is the third time we have used this product and not had great results. It's beer sure enough but it just doesn't taste that good. Maybe its us, and even though we follow the directions exactly, we understand it's not an exact science. That said, we will not buy this product again."
3,The good the bad,"Well, I think the product is fine, too new to tell long term. But, and there isn't always a but with me, the product was very slow to ship which was a major disappointment. However, it did make it and my son was thrilled since one of his true loves is beer!!"
4,Happy Brother is a good brother,Got this for my brother for his birthday. He lives on the other side of the country so it was super easy to have this shipped to him. He loves it!
4,Great GIft,I can only give this 4 stars because I do not personally know how well it worked or how the beer turned out. I ordered it as a gift and the recipients LOVED it! They were so excited to use it.
2,First Time Brewing,"Received my kit yesterday. Started brewing today. While the majority of the steps were extremely easy, (sanitizing, adding water, mixing in Hopped Malt Extract (HME), adding wort to barrell, cleaning up), I found dissolving the Booster to be the most tedious and time consuming component of the whole process thus far. It didn't matter how SLOWLY you sprinkled in the Booster, it still clumped together (like it was magnetized). Mr. Beer needs to create an easier Booster, even if the Booster ingredients have to be separated and added individually. It took longer to dissolve the Booster than all the other steps combined. My 2 rating is because of the Booster. I will update in two weeks when I perform the next step.Mr. Beer Premium Edition Home Microbrewery System"
2,"Good for a starter, but less than 24 bottles per brew","I got my MrBeer kit last Christmas and have been using it for a year. At first, it was fun and some of the beers were good (Cowboy Golden Lager, West Coast Pale Ale, Classic American Blonde, and High Country Canadian Draft). However, they all had something in common: sediment, and lots of it. I could only get about 18 bottles (12 oz.) per brew, with the rest being sediment. The brews were also consistently cloudy. Going to the MrBeer website, these are apparently common issues. I've been doing this for a year and have decided I can buy 24 bottles of my favorite beers for the same price as the MrBeer refill kits that give me only 18 bottles. And don't go for the Standard Refills - you will want Deluxe or Premium."
5,Terrific customer service,"Took a while to ship, but deifintely worth it and they were super accomodating! Great to give as a gift."
2,Beer mix is not what was stated in the product description,"I have brewed my own beer numerous times via the ""more complicated"" systems. I purchased this kit as a gift for a Christmas gift exchange and therefor am not certain who it will end up with so I wanted something simple that I thought most people would enjoy. I have obviously not used it, so my rating is not based on that. When I ordered the product, the description said it came with the west coast pale ale mix...and when it arrived today it was the American light. Probably not a big deal for whoever ends up choosing the gift...but also not what was advertised which is a little annoying. Basically, just be careful when ordering if you are looking for a certain mix. Probably a good idea to just order the mix separately."
2,Missing Parts,"Seems like it would be a great beer starter kit except for one thing, it came without bottle caps or the tap to the Keg. Amazon is sending another one so hopefully the next one has all the parts."
4,Excellent!,This was a Christmas gift for a beer lover and they were super stoked to try it out. They went through the process of making it and were satisfied with the product overall.
2,Can't speak on product,"I gave the product as a gift, so I can't say how it has turned out. What ticked me off was that is was mailed as is-not in a shipping box. It came in bent up, slight tear in the box, shipping stickers on the box..."
2,sent as a gift with a gift card and the card was not with the gift so they did not know who sent it,"sent as a gift with a gift card and the card was not with the gift so they did not know who sent it......don""t know if it was good or bad because they have not used it yet but from the senders perspective it was a miss cause they did not know I sent it."
1,Lousy Beer -- Lousy System,"If you like horrible yeasty tasting beer, then buy this system. When you are done ""brewing"" your first batch. You will probably drink one and try to get some friends to drink the rest. You may even convince yourself that ""it wasn't bad."" After that, you won't want to drink the crap again. A few years later, you will pull it out from a dusty closet and ship it off to goodwill."
1,Waste of time and money,"I followed the instructions and my beer didn't come out right. It's time-consuming and you have to wait weeks before your product is ready to drink. Half of my beer was flat, and that other half tasted like cider. I'm sure that some people are happy with this product, but I sure wasn't one of them!"
3,gd,decent machine worked for a year and a half then od'. Motherboard just went bad and couldn't get to repair. but still over all a good buy
3,Disappointed,It had only a few of there greatest hits the rest were mediocre. Bought it to listen to when riding my motorcycle and it did not want to play smoothly . It skipped a lot.
3,Lots of memories,Good transfer from the masters to a CD. My only criticism is that the CD is short. Surely there were a few more successful songs that could have been included.
1,too sexy for my coffee cup,can not believe how over priced this coffee is there are several other on-line sellers and i located this first in store and at nearly half the asking price with no shipping charges the product is acceptable but the price is very difficult to swallow would never buy from this seller because of cost not poor product
5,Fabulous Machine,"We've used the HP 9100 scanner in our office since it was first introduced - (eight-ten years ?? ago).... We use it in our business to scan our daily incoming faxes and important mail to our network for managers to read. Faxes are also automatically emailed to managers at remote sites. This machine has resulted in a remarkable improvement in efficiency. No more lost faxes!The machine paid for itself the first few months in paper reduction alone.We also scan all of our important business documents for off-site storage.Last year, after many hundreds of thousands of cycles, our original machine gave up the ghost. HP exchanged the machine for a new one at a greatly reduced price, and we were back on line with little downtime.We're very happy and strongly recommend this machine for scanning and storage of large quantities of documents."
3,Rollers,"Rolling wheels are not included in the order or price though they show in image, they are optional, It should be clearly stated , it is missleading."
2,Not the version it claims to be,"This is the 1942 version starring Sabu - not the Jason Scott Lee, Cary Elwes, Stephen Sommers version I was expecting. The DVD comes in a cardboard envelope - it looks exactly as pictured above. You get the option to play the movie or play with English subtitles. But don't expect the 1994 version or you will be disappointed!Update: jpecollectibles was wonderful and gave me a full refund and are looking into why the description is incorrect."
4,No Kipling Here,"If you are looking for an accurate account of The Jungle Book, look elsewhere. This is an Indiana Jones adaptation, including its own Temple of Doom. The characters are unidimensional, presumably because we viewers are too stupid to discern good and bad in more complex forms. Still, I enjoyed this film on a purely escapist level. Although it isn't the best film Jason Scott Lee has made (see Map of the Human Heart and Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story), he is still fun to watch and incredibly sexy. Sam Neil is boring as usual."
3,Sam Neill was great in this picture and so was Lee!,I loved the lush scenery and Cary Elwes getting his snooty buttt kicked by Jason Scott Lee. The clothes were great too.
1,Not as stated,"This was supposed to be of extra good (or whatever quality that is better than average) quality. I made more for this than other options due to the ""quality"" it was rated. The DVD skipped and had several scratches on it. Unfortunately it was a Christmas gift and I no longer had the information so I could return it and get my money refunded. I will NEVER buy a DVD like this through Amazon again."
5,Beautiful movie!,"Disney did a great job in this movie along with the actors who made it perfect. Family adventure/action, although maybe not for children under 6/7 because there are a few scary moments. It has good humor and heart warming moments. Lovely scenery too!"
5,Hard to find,Exactly what I wanted. Now I'm looking for it in DVD form.Do you have a resource for DVD's? Thanks for your help
2,Buy it or get a hard copy,Wouldn't consider renting because of poor viewing/buffing...even with high speed Internet and direct connect movie was glitchy and took too long to load after pausing.
3,Peach DeTox,"I bought this tea because I am a huge detox tea drinker. This flavor is just not for me. I think the tea is hard to swallow sometimes because of the strange peach flavor. I don't think it is your typical peach flavor. It's strange and I'm not good at describing flavors. In terms of detoxing, I also think it does an average job. I think it cleansed me the first week I drank it, but after that... not so much."
2,Like the flavor but no detoxing effects,"I love yogi tea, pretty much every flavor I have tried. This tea tastes good but I have had no detox effects with this one. I've used the berry detox and that one really works well so I'm not sure why this tea is not the same. If you dont care about the detox part, the flavor is very pleasant and mild."
4,Best tasting detox tea!,"I've tried a few different detox tea and many of them taste truly disgusting. Not the case with Yogi Tea Peach DeTox! It's lovely to drink, tastes like any other nice fruity herbal tea. Not a hint of disgustingness. I'm only giving it 4 stars because it's hard to tell whether any ""detox"" product is actually working. I drink it and hope for the best."
5,great!,this tea is tasty just the way it is. I don't add anything to it and now that it's hot outside I just make it and let it steep until it's cold.
1,yogi Peach Detox,"bought this because of the 'Peach' in the name of the product. Should have been labeled 'Cinnamon' as that is the only flavor that comes out. There is 'NO' discernible Peach flavor. very disappointed.Yogi Peach DeTox, Herbal Tea Supplement, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)"
2,"Yogi Peach DeTox, Tea",I like the other Yogi brands but this one not so much. It's ok but not so great.
2,PHOTO BULBS,"You are LUCKY if you get more than 20 hours from a bulb. I bought six due to their known limited life. Like everything else these days - cheaply made. I found the exact same bulb in a stash box that I had in storage ---- the bulb was probably 10 years old with no use. When I started using it, the bulb lasted for approximately six months."
2,2 hour bulbs at best,Great light source for video but the both bulbs that I ordered went out within two hours of use.Just make sure you buy extras so that you don't think you will be using them for the estimated 60 hours usage time.
2,Poor Quality,"The product was shipped nicely, but the bulb lasted a few hours. Kind of a waste considering they aren't dirt cheap. I was expecting 7 to 8 hours of usage, but I did not get near that."
1,"If blown bulbs is what your after, these are for you","I am furious right now. I just blew the second of my two bulbs, the first lasted about a hour and the second only about 30 min. Using them with a Smith Victor A12UL, dont waste your money."
3,"Ok Early Nugent, But The Worst Is Just Around The Corner.....","This disc and its companion (Call Of The Wild)are the 2 best albums Der Nuge ever made. Still, it's hard not to laugh at the lyrics and the ridiculous guitar playing. The rhythm section carries the ball here and makes these songs palatable. All of the Ted fans out there who only know him from his hideous CatScratch/WangoTango years are in for a real treat here. P.S. Don't pay these scalper prices, you can get these cheap on Itunes ($7.92)........"
4,Classic Nuge,THis album's classic sound is hard to beat. I know RYKO released the disk. But it is hard to find. I dont think it is worth 50-100 bucks though. I think I have seen copies of it for 10-20 dollars.
1,It Is Only A Joke,"Nugent's cartoon charector takes shape here, hey, this album may very well go down in history for the most hilariously bad cover of ""Maybelline"" ever. One hopes he's joking. It only gets worse. The truth is that this is a Ted Nugent solo album. It was just a last gasp at dragging The Amboy Dukes legacy and name through the mud (Ted was not known on his own at the time outside of the ""Journey"" success years earlier). Avoid at all costs. It's not The Dukes."
5,Ted before everything was about cat scrathing and wango tango's...,"Somewhere along the line, Tedso starting believing the hype and lost direction. This was when he was still part of the group although there was pressure to use his name. These songs are thoughtful and the musicianship excellent. No Wango's and Warriors white noise here. Hibernation, Sasha, Lady Luck, hell ever song is a winner. And of course there's possible the best (and my favorite) Ted song ever, Great White Buffalo. It all here from ballards to blistering rockers. Ted finest era for sure...."
2,Never Had A Problem With Amazon Before,"I'm getting a little upset that this item has not been shipped to me yet, as it is the 19th of August and I ordered it on the 1st. First I thought that the item wasn't in stock, but even as the days went by with no package from Amazon, the book was clearly in stock. I've already received Amazon orders that were made after this one. It's a little ridiculous that I haven't gotten it yet, and I'm tempted to cancel the order even though I haven't seen the book anywhere else. I just don't know what's taking Amazon so long with this specific order."
3,CIPA mirror review,"The mirror itself is fine and looks good. The finish of the mirror is quite good, although unfortunately the mount of the mirror is made of fibre and not metal. Although the description of the mirror is of a 'chrome' car side mirror, its actually made of light fibre covered with chrome polish which is basically delicate and inherently weak, and detracts from the overall look and finish of the vehicle. I use these mirrors on a vintage Austin A40 Devon, and I find that the construction of the mount is the only detrimental feature which really renders these mirrors unfortunately weak and detracts from their final appearance and styling. Had I known that the mounts are made of fibre, I possibly would not have bought the mirrors. Anyway, they are now installed, and at least give the impression of good quality steel or metal with chrome or nickel plating."
4,Cool for the price..,"These are cool for the price. They are made of a plastic type material that looks like real chrome (If they looked cheesy, I wouldn't have put them on my ride). The real chrome ones run about 30 dollars a set (I just didn't the cash at the time). Either way, I was satisfied.."
3,plastic base,did not realize the base is plastic. the mirror is metal. over all I guess its okay. But I would get the metal one
2,Disappointed,"Both my mom and grandma have the book that is pictured, which is why I wanted it and figured it would be what I received. However, I got some other version of the book. I didn't pay much for it and I figured it would cost more to exchange it then just keep it, so I still have the wrong book."
5,100pk is a great deal,These double sided case are perfect for burning multi-disc seasons. I purchased the 100pk months ago..and I still have more to go. I read other reviews from some not so lucky people about receiving cases damaged or broken. But I ordered anyways knowing that it doesn't happen to everyone. I got all 100 cases scratch-less! Definitely a great buy!
4,nice cases,Love the cases kids like them.Makes more organizable.good thing about them is you could put two dvds or cds.All case were perfect no damage
1,Poor quality,All of the cases in the 100 pack were warped and touched the DVD face. The cases are very flexible and offer little protection to the discs. The outer clear sleeve was poorly attached to the case and poorly trimmed. You get what you pay for!
1,Poor Quality,First of all just to clear one thing: I understand how 5 star rating works and I wish I could have given this product anything over one star but it was so poorly made that if you put your CD or DVD in the case it breaks. I do video and photo for weddings and there is no way in hell I would give this DVD case to my clients. And even for personal use I don't see this product being usable at all. Not to mention that it produces a strange plastic smell (I bought different DVD cases and they did not have any smell). Good Luck and I hope this helps your buying decision if you don't believe me just purchase it and you will be able to send it back thanks to Amazon's super easy return policy.
1,bad shipping,This is ridiculous if the item wasnt available then they shouldnt have had it up for sale 15 days later and I still dont have the cases I ordered...... What is the problem but yet you can take my money without a doubt.........................
1,"Very cheap, most are broken.","I bought these, even after reading other negative reviews. Truly a waste of money. Nearly half of the cases were cracked or crushed, making them unusable. Spend a little more and get a better quality case."
2,Cheap materials,"The material is so cheap that it always feels like you're going to rip the case apart every time you open them. Good price if you want to archive discs yourself; if you're creating a product to sell, pass these up. They'll make you look bad and or cheap."
2,"Product shipped supper fast, but about half of the cases were damaged","I purchased these for my photography business. Wanted to use them to give a photo discs, but when they arrived about half of the cases had torn sleeves... I don't provide crappy service to my clients, so I won't be using half of these crappy cases. If you are looking at purchasing these cases, expect some damaged goods. You're really buying only 50 cases and throwing away the rest...."
3,Good for the Price,I got them in perfect condition for the right price. They are not bad but they do have a tendency to break on you the plastic is on the brittle side. One review on here said they should last if you do not go at them like a Gorilla. I am not rough with my stuff but they still have a tendency to break on the tabs and some of them on the spine. All in all I am happy with them I have so many that if a few break it is not a big deal and some seem much better extruded than others so most will last the long haul. I have used about 20 of them so far and only 3 of the spines broke so that factors out to about a 15% failure rate not bad i guess at 25 cents a piece.
3,Inexpensive cases but they do have an unpleasant odor,"These plastic cases hold two discs (CD,DVD or Blu-ray) and have a clear plastic overlay on one side to insert a title (contents) sheet. They are well made and very thin, so they take up little space. One issue I have is that the plastic cases do have a chemical smell. I left them in my garage for about a week, with the cases open, to air them out. Most of the odor is gone, but it is still somewhat noticable. If you can air them you should have no problem. If you live in an apartment, I would suggest finding another source."
1,CHEAP product for not so cheap price,"The CONS:The plastic covers 'gape open' at the center once the 2 discs are in.The closure taps tend to break of or do not hold 'closed'When the artwork is from thicker material, it is impossible to shutThe plastic (on the side for opening and closing the folder) is rough and has sharp edges. It also has protruding leftover plastic bits that require removal (careful they can be sharp)Looks super cheep to store my documentaries and other rather pricy movie collections in.The Pros:The price is not too bad tough I cant say it is cheapThe space you save is 5 small folders to 2 large (original) onesConclusion:Though I kept the folders I ordered I will not purchase them again from this add.I will invest extra few bucks and get a better quality ones next time.I have ordered clear ones before, and though they are pricier, they were superior in quality. I will look for those for my future needs"
3,Meh,"They worked for the project I had in mind (mass producing a DVD for my class) but they are not of great quality. The plastic is prone to cracking, but the outside plastic sleeve is functional for some sort of cover. They're cheaply made, but they'll work if you're not trying to impress. I did have to throw some out because they were in such bad condition, but I didn't need all 100 anyway."
4,They are cheap and they do the job.,"I give my customers a cd and a dvd with their purchase. This is just what I needed. Would I like something fancier? Yes, but this was very cheap and it did the job. I need to keep costs down. Also this has a sleave to put a advertisment/label on the cover so it is just fine. Great."
2,Wrong photo on cover,"I love the B-52's. In fact, I'm in a B-52's tribute band. But the photo on the cover of this DVD is from the album Funplex, which came out in 2008."
2,CRAZY DRIVERS! But awesome graphics and color!,"I went from a Voodoo3 2000 to the Viper and I must say the graphics are 100% faster, clearer, sharper, and the colors are awesome! If you are a Quake 3 fan, the game gets redefined for the better! However, there seems to be all kind of drivers issue with this card! Bios flashing, upgraded drivers all the time, ect! Transform & Lighting feature not even available yet due to drivers delayed by Diamond. Also, do your reseach and make sure your motherboard can handle the card. Like I said, it's real buggy. If you are ready for awesome graphics at half the price of a DDR/SDR card and are willing to constantly fight with the drivers issue, then I recommend it, but if you just want to slap it on and play, stick to Voodoo."
1,Bad if you want it for PC games,Do not buy it I repeat do not buy it if you want to run graphic intense video games. I did and have to reboot my computer several time if runnung halflife or Quake or for that matter any game especially if using high res.If you buy it might regret it later.
1,It simply does not work correctly,"I was very unhappy with the performance of this product. I have used Diamonds products for years, i.e. Monster 3D, Monster 3D II, Megamonster SLI, etc. which are all first rate products, but the Viper II was plagued with troubles. After upgrading the Bios, and installing all drivers and updates I still got graphical distortion on direct3d games and lock ups on OpenGl. OpenGl games looked decent, but not compared to how they should look given Diamonds bragging. I returned this card for a refund and will wait for Voodoo6."
1,"a great product, but bad drivers","i bought this product when i had win ME, now that i've upgaded to XP, this card does not work proporly.... and just try to find a update driver lol..... so if your using xp forget this product...."
3,Not quite a ge-force,i just bought a 900mhz amd athalon processor w/ 128 mega bytes of ram and a Diamond Z200 Viper II 3D AGP Graphics Card. Now this card works great except for when im playing mech warrior 4 then it jerks a tiny bit every once and awhile. but if ur looking for a cheap price and quality go with this card.
3,Good budget card.. not great... but good,"I bought this card with my new P3 733 and abit se6 motherboard. It works great Quake 3, Homeworld, and Half-life, but took a little tweaking to run properly in opengl but nothing serious. I have had problems running Microsoft flight simulator and Unreal Tournament which is tragic becaue UT is supose to look great! I have noticed that new drivers have stoped being released. S3 must not have too much confidence in the card cause back in august they were tradeing viper z200's for older v770's that use a nvidia chipset. To get things to work S3 had to sacrifice some features to compete with geforce. This is a good card if you are on a buget and like to tweak your brains out, but I think it would be better if you spent $20 extra for a new nvidia geforce II mx."
4,Agnes Browne,"Movie follows the book well; Angelica Husted is an excellent actress. Supporting actress as ""Marian"" is good as well. I'll pass the video along to others."
1,Irish Movie arrives in German,"This has been one big hassle for me I ordered from Amazon and received the cd Agnes Brown (in German) from another source,music something so we exchanged emails and I sent it back to them and I understand I have a credit coming and now they are upset because they don't like the remarks I made and asked me to remove them I said I would but I don't know how to do that but I have not heard anything back from them. They also said I do not understand the system and they are right so I am going out shopping to see if I can find my movie Agnes Brown in English in a store. Thank you!"
4,"This album is half good, half not so hot","This double-album of 'The Seeds' is in my opinion, half good, half not so hot. The album, ""Future"" is good, very psychedlic in feeling, all the way through. The second album, ""Full Spoon of Seedy Blues"" is a not so hot rendition of some older 'blues' in the style of the original blues players, but just get's boring after awhile. I'm a big fan of the blues, but the 'Seeds' were not really at the top of their game on this one, and in the sleeve-notes from the CD, the 'Seeds' say so themselves. Apparently, they were still under contract to finish putting out an album, they were at a low spot coming toward's the end of their career, and just did a bunch of 'ole blues-sounding tunes' to finish up the album. If you purchase this album, it will be mostly for the ""Future"" album, which is worth checking out."
2,Tastes horrible...,"First off, I'm not super picky about teas and I don't normally write bad reviews but I had to write a review for this tea. I regret buying this product. It tastes like those cheap teas they serve at a Chinese restaurant. I can't believe the company would make such inferior product. I wish they would refund my money back."
5,great tasting,I bought this tea because of the low caffeine and the taste was still there; excellent for a green tea advocate.
5,The messages will stay with you for years!,We watched these when they first came out. We still call big box stores 'stuff mart' and it helps us keep perspective as we shop! These videos have great messages for kids and for parents.
5,The Second CD in an unbeatable series,"The British Invasion/ The History of British Rock/ Volume 2 : Rhino did a superb job in the creation of this series of CDs. Sure, the Beatles and the Stones are who you think of when the British Invasion is mentioned, but this series concentrates on the OTHER great groups of the time. Here you get a Ton of hits (and a few forgotten artists) in an extremely entertaining collection. Volume Two covers 20 more songs from 1964 and 1965. In volume Two you get Kinks, Zombies, Yardbirds, etc. but when is the last time you heard ""Do Wah Diddy Diddy"" by Manfred Mann or ""To know you is to love you"" from Peter & Gordon? Highly Recommended."
5,GOOD PRODUCT AND GOOD SERVICE,VERY REASONABLE PRICE AND ARRIVED AHEAD OF PROMISE DATE. THE BOOK IS IN EXCELLENT SHAPE BUT I ORDERED IT AS A GIFT SO I CAN NOT RATE THE CONTENT.
3,Good but difficult to read,"This book is very interesting to read but you probably would not want to use it in your homeschool as I was hoping to because the type is small and hard to read This must be because of the way that it was printed or the type or printer that was used, I don't know. This is a shame because it is biblicaly based and very moral and spiritually uplifting reading unlike most of the begining reader material out there. If only it could be reprinted with clearer type."
4,Terrific historical tool...,The blue back speller is a terrific historical look at what people were taught when our country was young. The words and lessons in this book suprised and amazed me. I am going use this with my children.
1,"I agree, too difficult to read","This book's print is too small for me to comfortably read (I have good vision). In addition, as it is a reprint, it is somewhat blurry and not crisp and clean. This would be impossible for me to use in homeschooling my learning-to-read children as the text is very close together. Too bad, I was looking forward to utilyzing this tool."
2,Poor printing,"I was excited about getting this book. I realize it is a reprint, but the print quality is poor making it hard to read. It was probably done to make the book look old, but I expected better quality."
5,FUN,Jonny Quest is for all. Hanna-Barbera Themselfs said. Jonny Quest is a si-fi show. Not a kids show.Hanna-Barbera's The Greatest Adventure Stories From the Bible: The CreationJonny Quest is fun. The Hanna-Barbara Personal Favorites. Are very good. This will be a Favoritof use old time Jonny Quest fans.
3,Sammy: Dallas Detective-- Back Cover,"""Sammy Kidman is a brash, good-looking undercover narcotics detective who achieves his outstanding conviction rate with no regard for the impact of his actions on anyone else unfortunate enough to cross his path. In a dangerous undercover scheme, he smoothly solicits the help of naive apartment-house neighbor, Marni Taylor.Through Marni's unrelenting love and passionate prayers, the God he has always ignored steps in to save Sammy's life. Redeemed, the aggressive detective tries his best to walk upright in the modern Babylon of Dallas, Texas.""This story starts out wonderfully, with a can't bear to put it down plot. However, halfway through the book, Miss Hardy loses it. The story becomes routine and boring and the ending is almost too much for even fiction. Overall, a good book, but Miss Hardy has done better."
3,Too bright picture...,"I bought this TV from BrandsMart.I found picture quality good.One thing I really got annoyed that picture is too bright which gave me headache. I was watching from distance of 12 to 13 feet.When I decreased brightness, I faced problem of dark picture which I couldn't see. Even after two weeks I could not feel comfortable and so I returned this TV.I will recommend to watch DLP picture little longer time to check whether it makes any strain to eyes before making decision.I don't think watching TV at showroom helps."
2,Stay away if you are a video gamer,"I bought this set about 10 days ago. As far as the picture quality, this set is great. But as soon as I started playing Xbox on it, I noticed a lag from the time I pushed a button and when the action would happen on the screen. There are extensive postings about this problem on the web (including Samsung's own web site). IF you plan on playing video games on your set, stay away from this one. I have returned mine and am in the process of buying a different set."
4,Samsung DLP TV,"I recently purchased a 56"" Samsung DLP TV and it is awesome. Clarity, color, sound are all fantastic. When you couple these with the amazing Amazon price.....well, you have a fantastic deal.R. MurphyHouston, Texas"
1,Faulty Samsung R5667W,"Bought this great TV in Dec 05. Very pleased with it until went wrong!!Samsung very unhelpful, basically, ""tuff only a one year warranty and we aren`t going to help you in any way with the estimated $900 repair bill!!"" I will never ever buy another Samsung product due to their lack of ""service""!!! Please join me."
1,Worst Album Ever By Anyone Anywhere,"I am a huge fan of the original Alice Cooper BAND but this album is truly horrible. It's all over the place. It sounds like some guys who don't know how to play any instruments decided to go into into a studio, drop some acid, and see what happens. It's absolutely and completely useless. How these guys got a record deal is completely beyond me. After listening to this album you can see how much work Bob Ezrin had to do to make these guys play something listenable. The next album, Easy Action is much better although the band still hadn't hit on their signature sound yet. No one who is sane and values their hard earned money would purchase this album unless your a collector of all things Alice."
3,Pretties for you,"This is Alice Cooper's first album. Most of the album isn't very good. However, 3 of the songs show signs of the Alice Cooper we all know and love."
1,What?????,"This album is just plain wierd! Songs tike the 1 1/2 min. long ""10 Min Before The Worm"" Most of these sons dont make any sence the the ones that do are just plain dumb.It's not that I woulden't recomend it.....I just wouldn't know who to recomend it to! If you lik Pink Floid you might like this.(in fact if it wasen't for Floid I doubt Cooper would have been given a second glance)If you are a fan of modern Alice STAY AWAY!!!! you might not even like it even if you were a fan of the original Alice Cooper Group. But if you are a true die hard and must have every thing Alice Cooper ever put out(dont be emberresed, I'm one of you!)Then By the album and see where it all began.One interisting note about the disc. There is a song on it salled ""Reflected"". It would later be reritten and renamed ""Elected"" for the ""Billion Dollar Babbies"" Album."
5,ALICE COOPER: Pretties For You,No need to get long-winded and describe this album-it is one of the Greatest albums of all-time. This album helped me get through High School.
2,Another disaster from Rhino Records,"If Rhino did the repressing of the album you're looking for, you're better off to lay down the extra cash to track down an original...unless you like listening to your music through a bowl of freshly poured rice crispies. This is the third Rhino 180g repressing I've gotten that's just full of surface noise. The first was the Ramones, Rocket to Russia, then Easy Action, and now Pretties for You. I'm officially done with Rhino records. See if you can dig up an original in decent condition. It'll sound better, and the gatefold cover's cooler, anyway."
2,Alice The Hippy.,"In my opinion, this is a good album, more on the lower end of the good side, bordering on bad. Now don't call me a typical Alice fan that hates his ""weird"" albums, one of my fave albums is his ""Flush The Fashion"" album... Pretties For You is just too... 60's psychadelic for me. You can definitely hear some trademark Alice vocals, and even some hints of guitarwork that would be flushed out on later albums. Not a horrible album, just not very good."
3,A good record,I don't own any other Alice Cooper records except this one. I like it because it's so different from his others. It's good psychedelic rock album--that's all. Thanks.
1,high fat,"Not all details are given on the Amazon web site. It says no trans fat, however, it fails to say the amount of total fat which is VERY high."
2,First Edition much better than Second,"The First Edition is a Classic; often the best and only book you need to learn practical statistics if you come from another field.The Second Edition is reasonable, and the major changes the authors made to the First Edition are understandable from one point of view, but they did not succeed in equalling the quality of the First Edition.The Second Edition is still a good introductory text on Statistics, but I recommend the First Edition if you can find it."
4,mathematical statistics: basic ideas and selected topics,"Good book, well written and complete (illustrated by examples).not adapted for beginners. A good level on mathematics is neededfor a complete understanding"
4,Solid text on fundamentals of statistics,"Bickel and Doksum is of course a standard text in mathematical statistics. The development of the theory is thorough but not as complete as books by Lehmann or Cassella and Berger. I felt that Bickel and Doksum occasionally left out important theorems and details. Also, the examples given were sometimes unhelpful or irrelavent. I personally disliked their penchant for the hypergeometric distribution and Hardy-Weinberg equilibriums. Nevertheless, the writing is clear and the book gives a solid background of the fundamentals. Personally, I prefer Casella and Berger for a more complete overview."
2,Get the 1st edition instead,"This book is terrible: unclear and riddled with mistakes. I've never seen such a massive errata for a textbook. I recommend getting the 1st edition (1977); it's very clear and easy to follow, whereas this new edition just creates confusion. I've found examples in the older edition that are extremely straightforward while in the newer edition the same examples are unclear and incomplete. If your professor requires this edition, spend the extra $35 bucks or so for the earlier edition as well."
1,A beta version of half a book,"If you're looking for a single reference on math stat, this isn't it, because it's vol 1 of a 2-volume set. Vol 2, which will include for example most of the material on non-parametric statistics, is not planned to appear until 2003. Possibly by then a new edition of vol 1, correcting all the typos, will be available, and then the set may be worth considering. The proofreading of the current edition of vol 1 was so sloppy that it cannot be recommended. The authors didn't even bother to run the text through a spell checker ('terrabytes'). The index is a bit skimpy, too.Until the book is completed, most of the errata corrected, and (dare one hope?) the index improved, better choices would be 'Statistical Inference' by Casella and Berger, or even Bickel and Doksum's earlier single-volume text!"
1,Please pull this book from circulation.,"Nearly everyone is correct about this new edition of a book previously held in high regard. This book should be pulled from publication until it has been corrected and issued with Vol 2. This book is in bad enough condition to psychologically damage an entire generation of statisticians. The original edition is not currently in print, but other (better) options exist. Consider ""Introduction to the Theory of Statistics"" by Mood & Graybill, ""A First Course in Mathematical Statistics"" by Roussas, ""Linear Statistical Inference"" by Rao and ""Optimal Statistical Decisions"" by DeGroot. They are older, but are correct and still fundamentally relevant."
4,Reader's Digest Family Songbook,Great songbook from yesteryear. It was fun finding it and at such a great used price. Shipped quickly and arrived in excellent condition.
2,"""Toy"" Book","When I read ""hardcover, 128 pages"" in the description of a book, I imagine a serious book, and have never thought to check the book's dimensions. I will from now on. This is a cute, superficial little ""toy"" book most suitable for the 10-12 year old collecting new Barbie dolls. It is not a factual reference book. It features one doll/outfit per page with a short blurb about the picture. The outfits are sometimes matched with incorrect accessories or off-the-wall descriptions. While this is of no consequence to the little girl playing with her first Barbie, it should not be confused with a book for serious collectors."
1,Poor Craftsmanship,The content and design of this thick book is great. Unfortunately the quality of the manufacture of this book in no way reflects the merchandise produced by PRADA. Prior to removing the book from the shrink-wrapped plastic it was obvious that a stain from the glue had soaked thru the cover. After reading the volume for about 30 minutes the cover completely seperated from pages. Utterly disappointing.
2,delirious koolhaas,"It seems like Koolhaas can never get out of graphic design architecture. At one point he became interesting but is now becoming like fashion designers where trend and surface have more meaning. Perhaps, he should quit architecture and become a graphic or fashion designer. Delirious Koolhaas.The Prada Boutique in Beverly Hills is quite nice. I recommend seeing his real buildings instead of buying books and if you have to buy his books, I recommend you first read ""Delirious New York"" and look at his competition entries for Park de la Villette and early works."
1,same old same old,enough with the picture books and a little more substance please. i enjoy koolhaas but he is making more money on books than his buildings. the prada store sucks and he is becoming a sellout. spend your money on something else or save it because all of his new books are garbage. just because you have a lot of pictures and images does not mean you should put it into one UNEDITED book.
3,white Battery keeper,We just moved into a new house and I'm hoping this will help me keep batteries organized and not all over the house.. My experience with ordering from Amazon has aways been great I receive the item in a timely manner and it is always in the best of conditions.
5,The microscope book I would want if I could only have one.,"The thing I like most about this book is it's readability. The book clearly explains the technical words and ideas used to leave the reader educated and informed on the subject matter. The mix of fun, excitement, enthusuasm, and technical knowledge is perfect. In my opinion, it is quite suitable for young teens and adults."
3,good but not easy,this product is very good but the the bookletis not very helpfull...it will not tell you how to fully operate this starter alarmoverall i will not recommended it for slow n' impatience people.
3,My Review,It works as it is supposed to if you can plug it in. It may not fit all cigarette lighter sockets ( esp. in sub-compact cars) due to its bulk. It also has a tendency to pop out of some sockets when you hit a pot hole. It fits snug and tight in my Toyota minivan but pops out frequently in my Mercedes SUV.
2,"Falls out easily, fan fails and you're cooked (literally)","When I first saw this item, I was excited as it had both AC and DC capabilities and came from a name I once trusted, Audiovox. Shortly after purchasing, it became clear that this would pop out of my DC power port every time I hit a bump or pothole. That was annoying, but wedging something below it seemed to hold it in place. Then, the fan failed in the unit and the rest was history. These things get very hot without a fan to cool them, and the smell of burning became a common occurrence when using this appliance on the road. It would function OK until it became so hot (and I mean BURNING hot) that you had to unplug it. There are no user serviceable parts in this and I can't find any support anywhere on the web that might suggest how to replace the fan or a fuse for the fan or whatever small component might keep this in operation. Don't bother buying it."
1,Curious George,I was never able to use this product. I contacted the company that I purchased it from and never did get a response.
3,A VERY MISLEADING AND DECEIVING TITLE,"Being that I'm a person who loves horror/comedy combos such as A&C Meet Frankenstein, The Munsters. The Three Stooges' spooky shorts, etc. I wanted to see a Laurel And Hardy film that put them in the setting of a haunted house with ghosts and strange goings ons. Even if it was like Abbott and Costello's Hold That Ghost, I would have been happy with that. Unfortunately that is not the case for this movie. While not a bad movie to watch, it has none of the trappings you would expect to find in a movie of this title. It has no haunted house, no ghosts, no graveyards, no seance, no thunder and lightning, no creaky doors, no cob webs, no howling winds, in fact there are not even any night time scenes. All you get are two coffins. Both of which wind up in the opposite locations of their destinations."
2,"pretty good, but just ten songs","I think this is a pretty good collection, but it's very short, with just ten tracks. Also, a few of the songs are in mono here, whereas they're in stereo on every other Turtles comp that has those songs on them (well, all the other comps that I know of, anyway). If the CD had had a few more songs on it (there are other Turtles songs that would have fit), I would probably have rated it higher, even with mono tracks."
1,repetitive,I already wrote a review of this disc and amazon didn't post it. I guess if you hear an album that really stinks and tell it like it is they don't want to post it.On this album the songs are (most of them) repetitive They have the same rhythem and beat as the hit Pushin' Too Hard. These guys are what is called a one hit wonder. And the songs are really what is called in the music biz. Filler.If you like songs that all sound basically the same but with different lyrics then this is a perfect example.
1,Appalling! Record company should be ashamed of itself,"I love the Seeds but I am appalled at how a record company can allow such a substandard CD into the market place. One of the tracks ('Tripmaker') is ruined by a sudden blast of some completely different music! (A female singer). It sounds as if when the album was being mastered or whatever, a dozy employee accidentally flicked a switch and managed to stick some other (non-Seeds) music on this CD. It's incredible! Don't they check CDs before they distribute them? Does Edsel/Demon/Westside have no quality control? 'Avoid'!!!"
5,Love this Music,"The British Invasion series from Rhino is a joy for all of us who lived thru that period and wore out our 45 rpm. Though there are a great deal of songs missing, what is here is a must have for all those mersey beats out there. Thank you Rhino for a great collection."
1,"Poorly made, very fragile, and way overpriced. Truly junk.","The first one I received was broken in several places (plexiglass AND wood), though the box it came in showed no signs of trauma. The company was nice and immediately sent me a second one no questions asked. That one came and had ill-fitting parts and was loosely assembled.Really a neat idea, but poorly executed."
5,Psychiatrist Review,"This book really ""works""-it's getting rid of the stress in my medical practice. The text is fast reading, no-balony, actually entertaining-loaded with great examples, quotes, and vignettes that drive home the many pearls (and a fair scattering of diamonds) or practical wisdom. I was immediately able to tell this book was written by practicing docs just like me: no wheezy absrtractions, no boring theory-mongoring, and no long lists of desirable (but impossible-to -achieve) ""ideal"" practices. Instead this is smart, practical stuff I have been able to use immediately to save myself hassles and wasted time/motion/effort. I highly recommend to all physicians the section on how to leverage your relationships to produce more, and also the section on continuing education, which was an eye-opener for me. I personally feel that every practicing physician should have a copy of this book,and use what's in it. Get this book today-it will work for you."
2,Didn't fill the bill,"I wanted to know how in the world physicians can see so many people in one day and feel confident they have gathered sufficient information, given good treatment or diagnoses, and not missed anything. I'd still like to know ..."
4,Did what it promised,"I was pleased with the color and texture of my hair when using this product. It was a little messier than I expected, and it washes out with shampoo so you have to be careful not to get caught in the rain."
1,Piece of junk,"I highly dis-recommend this router. It is a pain. It does not stay connected to the internet continuously. Working from home quite frequently I need to have an application running that connects me to the relevant server(s) at work. As soon as the internet connection gets interrupted that application has to re-start again (I often have to re-start my laptop). I have lost a significant amount of time. The solution, of course, is to connect directly to the cable modem or buy a splitter to connect my work laptop and the router. But that reduces the router to its wireless feature. Wired features become useless."
1,very bad customer service,"I got this router and it just worked for 1 day. After I spoke with the tech support, they have decided it was a defect product then transfer me to the customer service. Unfortunately, the customer rep told me that it is their policy to have me pay for the return postage. I found it shocking that belkin asks the customer to pay for their defect item. Very bad customer experience. For that, I won't buy any more Belkin products.""Please Note: This is not a pre-paid label. You will need to apply postage when shipping your defective item to Belkin."" Is it fair?"
5,Highly recommended!,Very smooth installation - up and running in just a few minutes. I'm running two Mac's and two wireless Wii's all working very fast.Stowell
4,Belkin - Says it All,I previously had a Belkin Router and I had no doubt about which would my next buy be ... This is a real good router - only and only if - the setup process was good ... There were hitches in the initial setup of the router ... If only the Manual and the Autostart were in sync about the process ! ... Otherwise - a recommended router ... Happy to have it!
2,"Looks great, works poorly","I bought this in Feb of '07 due to the draft 802.11n specs as upgrade to my Pre-N router that was also from Belkin. That model though had almost perfect stability which is what my gripe with this is: intermittent connections.Installation was a breeze and aesthetically it's the best looking router hardware but unfortunately frequently dropped connections (from a mere distance of 20 ft, on different channels from my cordless phone, and away from any walls and major physical obstructions) just does not cut it. A waste of $150.. stick with the Pre-N in my opinion if you want Belkin or look elsewhere."
1,Beware of the worst tech support!,"I am writing this review as I am on hold with Belkin for the 4th time. The worst tech support I have ever encountered. They are of no use and I have been disconnected with no call back. The unit I have, worked (sort of)for a week and then quit. Save yourself the frustration and do not but this unit!"
4,Belkin N1 wireless router,I have a home network running from a internet port ( blue color ). this router has cable modem port ( yellow ) and not compatible with network.The Belkin N1 wireless router does not have internet port . It will work only with the modem port which has for connection to the Internet.Big mistake: I bought a wireless router and i do not read well product description.
3,"Works great, but need some knowledge for assembly","Does the job, but needed to research connecting two routers. If that is your intention, go online and get direction from google . Other then that, equipment works well"
2,Not reliable,"It's great if you have multiple items to be plugged in directly into the Ethernet ports. Wireless is damn awful. Constantly drops wireless signal, needs constant restart to connect wirelessly. Not worth the price, not made for gaming."
1,Does not work well with PSN,"This router caused frequent disconnects with the PSN, even when I bought a long Ethernet cord and wired it in directly. I tried various settings found online to clear this issue up, some of which were not available in the router configuration page. Nothing worked. I switched back to the router that came with my internet service, and all of the issues cleared up. Will not buy a Belkin again if it is beat out by a none-name brand router."
2,Not what I expected,"I thought the new ""N"" protocol would give me improved reception for my wireless computers but when I set security on it I could not get connection. Other wireless routers have been no problem."
5,Easy to Install & Reliable,"I initially purchased a low-end Linksys router that caused nothing but problems. It was difficult to set up the LAN, and every time I powered down a computer or the router it failed to re-establish. By spending just a few more dollars I upgraded to the N1 protocol and got the Belkin router that installed very easily, and has given me no problem for six months. A friend asked for my old router, and I gave it to him reluctantly. Better that it go to the trash..."
1,Junk,I have had nothing but trouble with this router. It constantly lost connection with wireless and to the modem. It would take me several reboot trys to get it back up and running. I recommend that you purchase another brand.
2,Belkin N1 Wireless Router,"As compared to my older router, this does not do anything more. Not worth the extra money for features does not work."
4,Solid though overly simple router,"The router works fairly well and is simple almost to a fault. The flashing lights on the face of the machine have nice little icons instead of tiny little green lights with text written beneith them.However, the router does lack a few features such as QoS and the ability to write in long ISP host names. This is irritating if you're sharing the connection with a few people and would like to priorative certain types of content. And not being able to put in long ISP host names makes that whole feature useless as most ISP hostnames are long.The good news is that the hardware is very good. It's range even on G standard devices is awsome both in it's clarity and range. However the modes it can be in are also a bit lacking. It can only opperate a mixed G/N mode as opposed to pure N.On the whole what this router needs is a good firmware update which I'm sure is forthcoming. However, it's a good router for home use regardless of that."
3,Good and bad,The good news is the signal range. The bad news is longevity. These units die quickly. Good thing the manufacturer guarantees them for life.
2,Looks sleek; but keeps dropping the connection; support is mediocre too,"When it works, it is great. But for several months now, it keeps dropping the wireless signal more than a dozen times a day every day. On contacting support, they sent me a replacement. That kept dropping signals too. Belkin support asks you to disable firewall and enable broadcasting but that doesn't help either (why even have those features if we can't use it?).I havd to admit though, the device looks cool and fashionable. Wish it hung on the wireless signal."
1,Defective,I spent more than one hour on the phone with customer service including being escallated to a senior tech. The router is defective and has to be shipped to Compton CA. It can't even be dropped off. Router did not look like it was new. Don't trust this seller.
1,worthless,I can't belive i paid 150 bucks for this pile of crap at best buy. The set up was smooth until it came to set up security. Unfortunately if you own a MAC you get punished by their tech department (who barely speak english.) You also apparently have to have a masters degree just to set up any form of security. Who knows you have to go the uk web site to down load the latest firmware just so the damn thing will work at all. finnaly after the third day of gettng no tech support i've decided they can have this pile of crap back. bottom line i will NEVER buy another Belkin product again! To anyone who whishes to buy anything from this company if you own a MAC computer don't do it.
1,Bad Belkin,"I am totally disappointed with the support staff at Belkin - after numerous hours trying to follow their ""easy set up instructions"" I contacted Tec support in an effort to resolve the issues with my home network which was only operable at my main cpu.After 4+ hours on the phone I was essentially told that the problem was not theirs and was with my CPU's and tat I needed to contact Dell as their was nothing further they could help me with.I ended up crawling around under my house for 3 hours and hard wired my system that is now operating fine.I will never purchase another Belkin product."
2,"Ok router, but very fussy","I did my research as to what router to buy because I was looking to upgrade from a wireless B. Obviously wanted to be ahead of the game so I found this to be the best reviewed wireless router for Draft N out there. Set up was easy and I loved the idea of the indicators on the front. However, as I used it, found it to be very fussy. It seemed to run very slow and the connection breaks often. I ended up replacing our cable modem but that wasn't the issue either. I also found out that it has some issues concerning xbox live. It will work, but I found that trying to party up with some friends wasn't possible. In the last 3 months I've had to restart it and the modem at least 20 times because the connection slows. Now I am researching to buy a different one because there are just too many little things that give me problems."
3,Doesn't work with Nortel VPN client,"Pros:- Very, very easy to install.- Fast.- Good price.Cons:- Doesn't work with Nortel VPN client. Called customer support. No help from 1st level rep, 2nd level tech support never called me back.Returned to Amazon and got Linksys instead. Not that fast but I can connect to my work now."
2,Sent it back after 5 days of misery...,"Definitely has potential, but ""N"" technology isn't quite there yet. Installation and setup were a breeze, no problems whatsoever. In fact, the simpliest of the 3 routers I have ever owned. My problem was that I could not get my Belkin N1 wireless card to connect at any speed greater than 54Mbps. Calls to tech support were useless as they told me that I should be happy with 54Mbps. I have two cards one could connect at 300Mbps, one only at 54Mbps. The big problem with this router came with interference from my cordless home telephone. Anytime I answered the phone I would instantly lose the router connection. No matter what channel I set the router or phone on it was no good. Again, tech support could offer me nothing. By the way, tech support does not speak English very well. I boxed up all the Belkin merchandise and returned it. Hope you have better luck."
2,Belkin N - Don't Set High Expectations,"I had high hopes that the Belkin N would be better than my Linksys Wireless G (with SRX) access point, and I was disappointed. Here are the pros/cons:Pros:Very easy to set up initially, especially with the CD.Blue LEDs signal when things are working (Security/Internet, etc.)Sleek lookingGood priceCons:Intermittent connections, especially with mixed G and N configurations.You can set it so that it operates at 20/40MHz for faster speed. This did nothing for my configuration.Obtusive advanced set up screen. It does the job, but why make it so difficult?Overall, I would have kept this unit, but the dropped connections and intermittent signal strength (bouncing from excellent to good and from 54mps to 1mps was too annoying. Unless you go all Belkin or everyone is on the same floor, I'd opt for another unit."
1,No Security -- Belkin Declines to Help,"Router runs fine when in unsecured mode. When security is activated, it works for a short period of time then shuts down all wireless connectivity. Belkin refuses to provide fix or replacement."
2,Wireless Connnection Drops and Does not Connect,"I have owned this product for over a year. The reason why I bought this as because of the N connectivity, and also because it was aesthetically pleasing. The router works fine when wired, however whenever we want to connect a wireless device its a hassle. The ""Wireless"" LED on the router is almost always off unless a device is connected wirelessly, the only solution is to restart the router to make the wireless connection available. The support page on Belkin's website has disappeared too. For that reason I will take off another Star. If I was in the market for a new router, I would not buy this knowing what I know now."
1,Belkin Ni Wireless Router,Easy setup but the unit drop connection too often. Read reviews but brought the unit for its display and wider reception. Router is at one end of the house and wanted better signal connection at the upstair far end of the house. But the drop connections within a 15 feet radius was very fustrating and went back to my old 54g router which also happens to be a Belkin. Would not recommend this router.
2,"Stable, but limited bandwidth","Was happy with the stability of this unit for over a year, but always wondered why there have been no firmware updates since the units release several years ago...I recently upgraded my internet service from 6 to 10Mbps and was surprised to see no difference in my downstream speed. Tech support had me disconnect my Belkin N1 and attach my PC directly to the cable modem. Speed jumped up to 9.6Mbps. Replaced the Belkin with an Apple Airport Extreme, which has no problem delivering full download bandwidth."
2,Better Range with Wireless g,"The range on this item is awful. I expected it to have better range than Wireless g. It didn't. What a disappointment.Set-up and installation was easy, though."
1,Unsatisfied,"Product is unstable, keep dropping connection. I am totally unsatisfied and will be mailing this product alonk with the five (5) cards back.Gladwin Bailey"
1,Great Range When It Stays Connected,Listen folks....If Belkin made a defibrilator and you had a heart attack.....you would be six feet under by now.Garbage.....If you really want to buy this I suggest you rip your ears off with pliers before you do...much more pleasant experience.NUF SAID? Thank You :)
3,Boring but great orb videos,"Overall I thought this video was pretty boring. It's mainly just story telling and non of it are re-enacted. At the end of the video they did have some of the best orb videos I have ever seen. I've watched this video twice already. The second time I watched it, I fast forwarded to the orb videos.I think this video is worth seeing, but I don't think it's worth the price at all."
4,"New Hope, PA","Overall, I liked the documentary 'America's Most Haunted Town'. The documentors set up the basic history of the town nicely and Cathe Curtis was a wonder. The historical background of the town was concise; however, some of the interviewies still weren't quite convincing - even though they stated to ""see"" some remarkable paranormal phenomenon, this kept the documentary from being completely believable for those who are skeptics anyway. Though not a skeptic myself, my contemporaries were found still wanting believable proof of paranormal phenomena activity. The photo/didgital proof of (for lack of a better term) orbs was remarkable. The inner spirit of Cathe Curtis conversing with these 'spirit people' was extraordinary, and how they came to her sometimes enveloping her was amaizing. This sort of documentary brings us closer to proving or helping to prove that the living are not alone - we share a great deal of our world with the dead.Nicely done."
1,Don't waster your money!,"This DVD is horrible! I can't believe I am out $24 dollars for it. First they put this ugly woman on as the introduction. She's got a mole on her face the size of a tire. Then they have the nerve to have us believe that little white spots on people are ghosts. I have seen so many films on TV that showed us so much more, and was much more entertaining. I bought this DVD as an investment. I like to share my movies with others. Please don't waste your money. bba"
2,Disappointing,"This DVD is more of a home-grown documentary than the captivating evidence of paranormal entities I was hoping to see. The people in the DVD are sweet and well-meaning, but that's not what I bought this for. If you're looking for a ghost ""sightings,"" voices or supernatural behavior, you won't find it here. The final scene in which orbs are filmed outdoors is somewhat intiguing, but not enough so to recommend this item."
2,No Credibility,"I really wish I could have liked this video, but there's not much to like about it!It's only an hour long but for the first 50 minutes all you get are commentaries by people in the town and a visting psychic telling every ""spirit"" she encounters ""I love you"". When you finally do see something it's in the shape of orbs. Orbs mean very little to me. I can produce orbs by sitting outside on a summer's evening and filming bugs flying around.There were shots of paintings around the various inns in town which supposedly show spiritsbut they really were very blurry and difficult to see clearly. The psychic was very ""New-age"" and very annoying.I have seen a good many decent ghost videos, but sadly, this isn't one of them."
1,It left me speechless!,"As an Energy healer, I work intensively with energy and the Spirit world. My belief is strong and my commitment unwaivering. I have been a teacher and Spiritual councelor for 20 years now, using various sources of books and videos as guides for my students and clients.After viewing this video, I was speechless. It does nothing but make a mockery of the Spirit realm. It is difficult enough to provide or find good, quality content without the constant downgrading of skeptics and nonbelievers, but if rediculous junk like this continues to hit the market, it will only provide more fuel for their fire. I can see why there are so many skeptics out there after watching this film. I am very frustrated by the thought of any portion of the money I spent on this video contributing to more nonsense of this type."
1,This was an INSULT to all paranormal investigators!!!!!!!!!,"This movie flat out sucks! The orbs are the spirits... you hope you see apparitions from reading the description. BUT YOU DON'T! These people flat out ruin the work of serious ghost hunters. They use a cheap Sony Mavica 640x480 resolution digital camera. Everything you see is a dust orb or moisture orb. The actual videos are also of ""skeptical variety"". Don't waste your money UNLESS you want a good laugh!!!!!!!!! I cannot give this a fair rating because Amazon starts the ratings at 1 star. I give this a flat out ZERO STARS! I was thinking of making a sequel and dumping a used vacuum cleaner bag onto a floor in my house and showing how many GHOSTS I have in my home!!! Ha Ha Ha! Cathe Curtis, you are a joke! Fulton sucks as a spirit photographer!"
1,Disapointed,"The description of this video states there are actual sightings of spirits in their many forms. I viewed the tape several times in hopes of at least catching a glimpse of something, but to my disappointment - nothing but a few orbs, which are easily produced by light reflection.Ms. Curtis' approach to the spirit world is cutesy, but seems somewhat demeaning. ""Can we take your image? Aren't you precious."" Even my 8 year old daughter rolled her eyes at that."
1,Don't waste your money,"I have watched a lot of true ghost story shows on Discovery, Travel Channel, etc. and expected something similar with this video. This was HORRIBLE! This had to be the dumbest ""real"" ghost story video I have ever seen. The ""real"" images were nothing more than light glares. To make the images move on video, the guy just wiggled the camera. They had a ""sensitive"" that went to 3-4 of the locations and immediately found the ghosts everytime at which point she professed her love for them and pretended to communicate with them.By the end of it, my wife and I thought we were watching a Saturday Night Live skit because it was so ridiculous."
1,America's Most Haunted Town,I own this one the worse ever I have seen. Take my advise don't waste your money .
2,Kinda cheap,Not very pretty. You can tell its plastic when you look at it. It was cheap enough thought that I'm not going to return it. At least I won't break it like the last really nice glass one that I had.
2,Not Forever. Cracked & leaking in less than 2 months.,"Not Forever. I have used the pitcher almost daily for iced tea since the first of June. It has gradually been developing fissures inside the polycarbonate and yesterday I discovered a leaking 1"" vertical crack along the bottom edge after taking it from the dishwasher. It was never dropped & hasn't received any type of impact."
3,lola beltran,"I can,t say to much about this lady,I have been a fan of this lady and her singjng since I was little.her movies gets your attention, when you see them.I wish there were more dvds about this great lady."
3,"A bit of ""Vertigo"", but lots of great De Palma touches, too","This early De Palma movie is dreamlike and artful, yet still works as a bang-up suspense thriller. The DVD has lots of interesting extras, too."
5,Obession of Vertigo,"Brian de Palma did a very good job with this movie. The story is similar to Hitchcock's Vertigo, a man who lost his wife, discovers one day a woman who looks like her. This is why we can consider Obsession like a brilliant hommage to Hitchcock. In fact, Brian de Palma borrows heavily from Vertigo and a little from Dial M for murder (whith the murder scene with the scissors). Obsession should be watched after Vertigo in order to understand the links between the two movies. Thus, the music is composed by Bernard Herrmann and is very reminiscent of Vertigo's music. Herrmann thought that it was one of his best movie music and we can agree with him. Obsession is one of the best movies of Brian de Palma, it is an hommage of a master to another. Full of cinematography inventivity, suspense, good acting and characters, Obsession is a true obsession for viewers. Watch it and you won't regret it !"
4,Hitchcockian Pastiche,"So many have spoken about DePalma's stylistic homages to Hitchcock during the seventies. Kael, who blasted DePalma for Obsession, calling it an empty exercise, thought him at his best when he indulged his trashier impulses. In fact, I think she missed the grand, trashy joke behind Obsession - or consider the film's final moment and take a good look at Robertson's face as the camera swirls around while the young mystery woman confesses her secret. The look on his face is priceless. Kael said the camera, in Obsession, seems to swirl around ""nothing."" Precisely. Or so Robertson seems to be realizing.Obsession, watched the first time, plays like a romantic drama; the second, like a campy black comedy."
3,Ah soso,Well the movie starts off very slow! Good plot acting eh cinematography good for the time. Loved the twist very unexpected at that.
3,Be careful what you wish for.,This is a great movie about how being obssesed with someone can lead to great tragedy for both you and them.
2,Bugs with Macintosh driver,"I like the quality of the print but my main complaint is that when I print out text on this printer it gets screwed up. Some characters get printed on top of other characters as though the buffers are being written out in the wrong position. Graphics are fine. In addition, this is not a cost effective for total cost of operation as it costs too much for the cartridges."
3,So-so after a week of struggling,"A week after buying the Canon S450, I find: 1) The MacIntosh driver software hangs up repeatedly. I've had to reinstall it twice. Sometimes the chooser can't find the printer! 2) Paper handling is iffy: sometimes the printer grabs 5 pages at once. 3) It's hard to get an accurate idea of the color it will print (of course, that's a complaint with all printers). And USB is wonderful. What a great invention!"
5,Searched high and low for this tea,Love the flavor of vanilla and hazelnut. Very hard to find this combination in an herb tea. Very flavorful. I have been sharing with lots of friends due to the quantity I had to buy. Everyone has liked it. Definately worth giving it a try. I have gone through my first box already!
3,Vanilla Hazelnut tea,"Overall I like this tea...but I was going out on a limb buying it on Amazon because I had never actually had it before...I had waited for Celestial Seasonings Vanilla hazelnut tea to become available again, but it never did...for a Vanilla Hazelnut tea this one has a little more spice than I'd like...but overall I like it."
4,good,good product this one has been re mastered very well and I enjuyed the movie keep up the good work
3,Could have made them myself,"The product was good. But once I received them, I realized I could have made them myself with some pieces from the craft store and a glue gun."
1,$1 at Michaels craft store,"These animals are $1 at Michaels Craft store, all this company is doing is hot gluing a clip to the back. You can buy a hot glue gun and these animals for less than what they are selling them for."
1,PRICE RIP OFF,YOU CAN GET THESE AT YOUR LOCAL CRAFT STORES. YOU CAN BUY THEM FOR ABOUT 50 CENTS A PIECE. WHAT A RIP OFF.
4,Powerful holocaust story,"Interesting story of one man's survival of the holocaust from W'W.2. and how, as a Jew, he was forced to use any method to ensure survival. There is no attempt to disguise the facts and the book is written in simple terms with no feeling that the author,s father, who is the one involved, is a hero but just a simple guy doing all he could to survive during the time I call the great madness in Germany. Well written and a decent history of this horrible crime against humanity."
3,Memoirs of a Holocaust Survivor,"I recommend this book to younger people, who do not know anything or little about this subject. It is written in simple language, however strewn with spelling mistakes."
4,A reminder never to forget,"To come to a partial understanding of just what every holocaust survivor lived through books like this must be read. I have a great admiration for Icek for not giving up hope in those desperate circumstances. To face death daily and still to be able to think of others is incredible. I would have given it five stars but for me the book was void of any real emotion and left me (as the reader)feeling more like I was reading a textbook account of the holocaust rather than through the eyes of someone who actually lived it. It did not draw me in as other accounts of Auschwitz have. However, maybe living through something like that I'd also be void of emotion.I would still highly recommend this book."
5,You will be shocked when you read Icek's memoirs,"After seeing the movie ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" I was compelled to read more about Holocaust survivors and all they had to endure to survive when odds are against them. I knew the Germans during WWII were cruel but I had no idea to what extent until after reading Icek's memoirs. They did not let anyone stand in their way for absolute power. Icek was lucky enough to be a ""jack of all trades"" and his skills and faith kept him alive. I do have to admit that after reading the memoirs I will have a difficult time reading actual events that occurred in the camps because what occurred was so inhumane. Once is enough for me."
1,Memoirs of a Holocaust Survivor,This book is interesting however it appears to have been written by a child or from a childs point of view. Not what i expected. Disappointing.
4,A really good survivor story,"This story is told in a factual, almost emotionally detached voice. It makes it all the more impactful when the author talks about such horrific experiences. The things he experiences and sees are beyond immagination, yet this is human nature, this is how people treat people. The matter-of-factness caused a strong emotional reaction for me, that's for sure. Highly recommended."
3,Interesting story,"In trying to understand how the Holocaust happened (and how nations ALLOWED it to happen) I have been reading true stories from survivors. This was an interesting account told by a mans point of view. While the facts were interesting (and at times heartbreaking, as most of these stories are) I did not care for the literary style. It seemed to have no style at all, just written like a diary record."
2,"Great book, poor formatting","For one dollar less, you can have the Spanish version of not just Martin Fierro but also the equally important sequel right here:El gaucho Martín Fierro y La vuelta de Martín Fierro (Spanish Edition)Someone has actually edited the 1.99 version and made sure the line breaks are in the right place so you don't have to guess how it's supposed to be while you read. Much more recommended than this version, in which they have merely copied and pasted from Project Gutenberg."
3,Depends on what you are looking for,"How would I rate the item? 3 out of 5 stars. I was hoping the book would have more to offer in regards to rearing an Irish Setter, but it is very much about the breed and breed standards. It was my own ignorance about the contents of the book that led to any disappointment."
4,"Fine for use in High School, but...","This calculator is very comfortable to use, and includes all the important features needed for high school math, but it is limited to that. The senior math-geeks will feel limited by this calculator and should spend more money, getting a higher model that will keep being useful more time.It features algebraic mode only, as opposed to RPN mode (which has become almost a conditio sine qua non in an HP calculator).For the average teen in high school is fine, though."
5,Simply Excellent,"This is an affordable and very powerful calculator, what else could I say?, the best option for the kids at school."
1,Not the HP quality that I am used to,"This product looks good, but you should always be suspicious when one of a technical item's selling points is a fashion statement like a multi-colored faceplate. Dell tried this and dropped it -- too bad HP didn't catch on.In summary, the HP30s is a piece of junk. The display started to have pixel failures after only a few hours of use. It is not anywhere near the quality of the old HP business and scientific calculators. I have a HP12c that is twenty years old and going strong. I didn't get 20 days out of the HP30s."
1,H.P. What's Happening?,"I am an engineer and a long-time fan of H.P. products. The HP-30S, however, is a disaster. It started acting dodgy immediately after I purchased it, and it ultimately became so unreliable that I had to find a replacement. Maybe I'm being overly harsh because of my disappointment with both the product and the brand, but I really hope this is an anomaly and not an indication of the direction H.P is heading.p.s. I purchased a Casio 115MS as a replacement, and I am very happy with it."
1,would not even turn on,"i am an amazon prime member for two years now and probably purchase 150 or so products from amazon each year. in all that time i only wrote two bad reviews: one was for a dinky $2 product that arrived cracked and the manufacturer replaced it immediately, no questions asked. this is the second time - i ordered this $10.00 calculator just to have something extra to use around the house (besides my phone or computer). i used to own a solar powered HP calculator about 15 years ago and i loved it so i decided to give this one a try. it arrived fairly promptly but when i opened it up the calculator would not even turn on. it's not worth my time to repackage and walk to a post office to return a $10.00 item but at 7:35 in the morning it is not too much effort to give this warning out to all of you out there."
2,hard for a new calc user to figure out,"I am an electronics student, and I have TI, Casio, and Sharp. The first thing I have to say is how ""SORRY"" the instruction sheets are. I am as I write these lines, still trying to figure out how to use the percentage keys. I will have to call HP Customer Service since I have been at it now for 3 hours. My other Calcs are more user friendly. I am trying to like this HP, but I must admit that HP is not making it very easy for me.PS HP, save the faceplate money and put it instead on a decent manual. A calculator is not a fashion statement, but a tool."
1,An unworthy piece of junk.,"It is cheap, which is the only thing going for it. Aside from the usual complaints about it not being an HP (no RPN? terrible keys? fashionable looking?), it had a short unhappy life before it started crashing. Crashing when turned on. Crashing when picked up. Crashing when doing multiplications. I gave mine away and the person who got it had nothing but complaints."
2,Nothing to recommend it,"There's nothing to recommend this calculator over any other cheap calculator by TI, Sharp, etc. I bought it when my 15 year old HP48 died and this is just not a replacement.If you're out of high school, the idea of a graphics calculator is kind of silly given the accessability of spreadsheets, but as a statistician I found my HP48 useful for lots of quick calculations. The 30S has lost virutally everything I found useful (RPN, all the valuable probability distribution stuff) and has limited functionality in most other areas. What it has got is 3 different color face plates (what? do they think it's a cell phone?) and the virually useless ability to calculate means, standard deviations, and correlation coefficients (why would anyone waste time inputing a bunch of data into a calculator when they could save it in a spreadsheet file?)."
3,Like Jacob's Ladder but not as good.,"The flashbacks and the imaginary were completely hard to follow, had to see the movie at least twice to fully understand what was happening. The ending will definitely take you by surprise. Recommend to people who enjoy confusing plots and weird twists."
2,Almost worthless........ this film stinks,"Im a horror fan. Halloween, The Thing, Scream, Christine, I know what you did last summer, Alien, Urban Legend....... im all over all types of horror films. Soul Survivors is barely above aweful. It made little sense to me. After the movie was over I wasnt sure if the lead character was just dreaming the whole thing or not. Yes folks, it one of those ""it was just a dream"" films that we all hate. You know what im taking about. We are tricked into thinking these things are really happening when they are just someones dream. And if the film wasnt someones dream it wasnt all that scary anyways. Dont waste your time. Besides a SUPER HOT CHICK (the brunette) I hated every second of Soul Survivors."
1,Bad Filmmaking In Excess,"It's hard to say what's more sad about SOUL SURVIVORS--the fact that it's a terrible film of the highest magnitude, or that it makes previously well-thought of actors like Wes Bentley and Eliza Dushku seem like wooden amateurs(yes, they are that bad here). I won't even get into the plot, which is described on the Amazon.com website review--that reviewer is actually making it sound like it's a watchable film(and trying to convince someone that fifth-rate Julia Stiles imitator Melissa Sagemiller is ""Gwynethesque"" is near blasphemy to a genuine talent). This film makes me wish Tom Cruise made more films like EYES WIDE SHUT and VANILLA SKY(hello, it's that bad). All I can say is run. Run as fast as you can."
1,What the...???,"That pretty much sums up this film.I waited over a year to see this film, and I am completely disappointed. This movie not only had mediocre characters, but a completely farfetched not too mention extremely lame plot. All I wanted to do throughout the film was turn it off, but I gave it the benefit of the doubt and watched the entire film, and now that is a hour and a half I will never get back! Save the money and see or buy another film, I won't tell you which one because anyone will be better than this one! :("
4,Not the best but not that bad.,Alot of people are rating the movie poorly because they didnt understand it. The storyline isnt really that bad. Granted if you dont like movies that make you think then you wont like this. I am very picky about the movies I watch and what I consider to be worth watching. This movie grabbed my attention a few years ago and I rented it and thought it was good. Granted I wouldnt buy it for more than 10 bucks. Its not that bad of a movie. Try renting it before you buy it though. If you like movies with a twist that will cause you to think and keep you wondering then this is a good movie. If you prefer movies where you know everything in the first 10 mins then this isnt one for you.
2,CARNIVAL OF SOUL SURVIVORS,"Gee, is it just me or is this movie just CARNIVAL OF SOULS with a catholic guilt syndrome thrown in? Add a priest that's a ghost and you've got SOUL SURVIORS. I saw this in a theater with just myself and no absolutely no one else was in the theater on a SATURDAY no less. I don't understand why there are so many CATHOLIC GUILT horror films that mix religious faith with horror. Stuff like STIGMATA, and BLESS THE CHILD. Who writes these bogus horror movies? People who are trying to sneak catholic doctrine into horror movies? Most irritating trend ever if you ask me. Why can't horror films just be horror, like JEEPERS CREEPERS. I don't care about family unity or wether or not some wretched girl wakes up from a car accident. I want blood and gore and to be scared. Please feel free not preach at me!!"
2,CARNIVAL OF LADDERS...,"I watched this movie because of the stellar cast, including Eliza Dushku (WRONG TURN, THE ALPHABET KILLER), Wes Bentley (P2, THE PERFECT WITNESS), and Luke Wilson (VACANCY). How could it miss? Well, SOUL SURVIVORS, while not a total bomb, just isn't all that engaging or exciting. Sort of a teen version of CARNIVAL OF SOULS or JACOB'S LADDER, the story simply can't stand up to these creep-out classics. The idea of life and death bleeding together is fascinating, but the story in SS isn't strong enough to make it work (a good example of this theme can be found in LEFT IN DARKNESS). Perhaps, if I hadn't seen CARNIVAL or LADDER, I could have enjoyed this one more..."
2,Big Plot Holes?,"This movie was OK. I'm still a little confused about the opening scene. It was really awful and then... nothing ever came of it. Two freaky raver guys commit a horrendous crime that seems to ""mean"" something. Throughout the movie they pop up to chase the main character. That opening scene is never explained or linked to anything else in the movie. I feel like they just threw it in to make the movie ""scarier."" By the way, this film is not scary at all. It's more like a drama. Luke Wilson, a favorite of mine, was horribly miscast and his character was almost funny, it was so terrible. He did the best he could... but he was playing a dead priest. I, like many people, was drawn to the movie because of Eliza Dushku... and on the cover of the box she looks like the main character. But no, her part was small and random and odd and the movie was mostly about ""Cassie"" played by Melissa Sagemiller. Her acting was fine, but I was exhausted by the ""plot"" which is repetitive and silly."
2,Not Good,"Such a waste of fine young actors in this film. The central theme is a decent idea, though done before in a few other films, most recently in a movie called Dead End. The directing is very heavy handed, and plot points are all over the place. If the acting had been terrible, at least this one would have been fun to watch ala an Ed Wood movie."
2,Wha?,"This movie was horrendous. It made little sense and was terribly dull. But I still bought it because I dig the idea of Eliza Dushku making out with another woman, even if she did look like a dude."
2,Killer Cut??????,"I'm glad I didn't watch the theatrical release of this movie because this ""killer cut"" is said to contain more blood and more terror. Geez. That must have been boring!!!!!! ( theatrical cut ). This is your basic supernatural movie about a woman who gets into a terrible car accident. She starts having hallucinations and begins to wonder who her real friends are. There is poor acting and basically the movie is boring and doesn't make much sense. Don't let the box fool you for you will be somewhat disappointed."
5,The Best Movie I Saw This Summer!,"This movie is the best I saw the whole summer!The story is about a girl named Cassie(Melissa Sagemiller)who just lost her boyfriend Sean(Casey Afflect)in a terrible car accident, Cassie and her best friends Annabel(Eliza Dushku)and Matt(Wes Bently) survived the crash.After Sean's death Cassie experiences supernatural moments, she also has a stalker who seems to want Cassie REAL BAD.Then Cassie learns the shocking truth about the car accident.The only thing wrong is at the end was a little confussing, but not much.Oh yea, if your thinking this is a slasher film, it's not."
3,Pretty Good,This movie has a good premise but is SOO confusing! I watched it like 3 times and still dont get it. I will admit that the only reason why I watched this movie in the first place is because of my beloved Eliza Dushku :) But its acutally not a bad movie. You really have to think and concentrate when you watch this.
1,title of review,"So up until I saw this movie I thought Valentine was the absolute lowest modern teen-horror movies could sink. Then I saw Soul Survivors. It isn't as hackneyed and generic as Valentine, but it is really, really boring. I had trouble telling the two male leads apart, they both had exactly the same haircut, and no distinguishing features. The plot just went nowhere. After the hints that something sinister is going on start presenting themselves, the plot goes nowhere. There is no progression towards figuring out what is going on and reaching a conclusion, the plot just stagnates, with numerous sinister occurances that are never explained. Even at the end of the film, we get no closure. The question of whether the people pursuing the girl were real flesh and blood people, paranormal manifestations, or merely her own personal delusions, is never answered. That just adds to the weakness of the film though. Even if there was a conclusion, it would still be unwatchably dull."
1,A Parody Of I Know What You Did Last Summer,"This movie falls completely flat. The only reason I watched it is so I could look at Eliza Dushku and she doesn't look as good as she should in this movie because she is gothic looking in this movie. This movie is not scary or cool,its downright awful and funny. Skip this unless you have a sense of humor. This is even worse than I Know What You Did Last Summer and the Scream series combined(yes its that bad)and I hope you to heed to my warning."
3,Not Bad,A bloody car accident turns into a supernatural tale for a college student and her friends. It was not a bad thriller for a rental.
3,Not bad..... worth seeing,"After reading all of the reviews I had to check it out for myself. I didn't think it was as bad as most of the reviews say. It was interesting and it kept my intrest until the end, however it was a little confusing and the ending was not that satifying. I do think it is worth checking out and seeing for yourself."
1,forgot i watched it,"this movie is so forgetable that when i woke up the next morning i had fogotten that i had watched it, i then proceeded to press play and it was only after the first few seconds that i realized that i had seen it, that it was boring and i never wanted to see it again. the only positive thing about the movie is that it make a great coster!!!"
3,can someone help me out???,"i just saw this movie. i was expecting something great (seeing the producers did ""i know what u did..."" and ""urban legend"") . the problem is i didnt get the movie AT ALL. can someone explain what the hell it is bout?thnx"
2,"I really really wanted to like this, but..","umm.. I saw the movie, and, I really don't know what to say! Eliza Dushku is my favourite actress, and I really just didn't get this movie! Here's PACC:Plot- 1/5 Made no sense what so ever, I'm still trying to figure out the ending a month later!Acting- 5/5 Great, top notch! Dushku ruled, Sagemiller was great as the main star! As for the guys, weren't so great, but that didn't matter.Character- 5/5 Creepy bad guys, like in Buffy.Cheapness- NA Seeming as I still don't know what really happened, but I have a fairly good idea, so I would give it 4 stars here!So, it was just the plot that destroyed this movie! Otherwise, it would have been a top notch movie!"
3,Eh -- It's o.k.,"Basically a remake of 1962 ""Carnival of Souls"".I wouldn't go out of my way to see this film, but if there is nothing else to watch; it's not too bad.The young ladies in tight outfits keep you awake. Add a star if you like the actresses."
1,Quite possibly the worst movie of the year,"Completely confusing, utterly muddled, this film could have been so much better with use of different film style or film stock (like ""Traffic"") to differentiate the ""dream"" sequences. Lost two hours watching this movie that I'll never get back."
1,Worse movie ever,"This movie is just horrible. To anybody who has not yet purchased this movie, please do not. Don't waste your money. Don't even rent it and waste your time. To those people who gave this film a good review, I'm not exactly sure what movie you watched but it couldn't have been this one. This movie is nonsense."
3,A decent flick that messes with your mind!,"To be honest, I seriously had my doubts about this movie when I saw it in the theater. I heard the release kept getting delayed, and they had to re-edit in order to get a PG-13. I wasn't expecting much. But the plot was intriguing and when I watched the scene at the goth rave in the beginning, I knew it was going to be something different and interesting. It's not your typical teen slash 'em flick. This movie really messes with your mind, making you question what's going on and wonder what's real and what's not. The ending finally does explain those questions, but there are some that go unanswered even as the credits roll. I suggest you check this out before bashing it. It's a movie that you might have to watch several times in order to understand it. While the ending might not be original, the movie itself adds a nice psychological twist on the teen movie genre."
2,I Survived It!,"This films starts off good, but after a while falls badly. Although the acting is good its very hard to understand whats going on.In the end I just forgot everything that had happened and didnt have a clue. It must be one of those films where you have to watch it twice but not me I cant sit through that again.Rent it before you buy is my tip."
1,Worse than I expected,"I wasn't really expecting this movie to be good, but I thought it would be somewhat entertaining. I was wrong. I'm not sure why I finished watching it, especially when I found out how [dumb] the ending is. There is not really much to tell about the non-existent plot, it took about 30 minutes for anything much to even happen. The opening scene has nothing to do with the rest of the movie. Most of the time I was wondering why Wes Bentley, Luke Wilson and Casey Affleck were even in this. The DVD does have some features, a few deleted scenes. One of the deleted looks like it might be an alternate ending, which is somewhat of an improvement over what ended up in the actual movie. There are some animated storyboards and some selected scene commentary from Melissa Sagemiller, who played the main character Cassie. Even with the features I can't say this movie is worth watching."
1,How bad is this !,"You get the whole lot!Bad direction, bad story, bad acting, bad photography...If you understand a thing in this, tell me! It's completely dumb, stupid and non sense.If it's broadcast on one of your TV channels, choose another channel. Thanks."
2,Very weird movie,I watched it from start to finish and don't understand the movie. It is a very confusing movie.
2,NOT GOOD AT ALL.,The plot of the film was vey promising but it took to long to get to the point and it became boring. Hoping that it would get better I finished seeing the film it went from promising to boring to straight out pathetic. I found that her boyfriend was not dead instead it was her two friend (Dushku and whats his face) and that she was in limbo the whole time while trying to be rivied in the operating table. When you read this it may sound good be when you see the film it's just anti-climatic. The performance where some what stale even though they are all good actors they fall short in this film. I would not recomend this movie to anyone and i'm sad to see many suffered seein this movie just like I have.
1,What?,"Boring, derivative tripe. Not a single unexpected plot twist. Nothing even gory enough to make me squirm. Is this the new face of cinema? I sincerely hope not."
1,Probably the worst horror movie ever..,".. well actually I'm not sure if this was SUPPOSED to be a horror movie. Watching this movie is like staring at the wall. There's no action.. and when there is! It doesn't make sense what's going on. If they were trying to make this a horror movie, they did a terrible job. If they were trying to make this movie make SENSE, they did a terrible job as well. I saw this in the movies.. got bored to death.. and then I rented it again just to see if I would change my mind. Well I didn't. And the bottom line is.. this movie sucks."
4,finally found the theater cut of movie,"I have been looking all over for the one shown in theaters. Thanks to amazon, I have finally seen that one. Which makes it a very good 2.99 spend. I enjoy the on demand rental from amazon very much. If you could tell me where to find a video of soul survivors from theaters for sure. Then I would be very graceful. I am just very happy to have a place where I can see the theater cut of soul survivors."
1,Save your time and money,"I watch atleast 6 DVDs a week and this was by far the worst I've seen since Jeepers Creepers. The plot if you want to call it that, makes no sense whatsoever. It's hard to put words to how bad this movie actually is.Perfect gift for the mother in law that you don't like."
3,"Not bad, but a bit boring","Not a bad movie, but a bit boring. Eliza Dushku looks great, but unfortunately doesn't have all that much screen time."
2,A SNORE Survivor I was NOT,"This movie re-hashes so many (superior) movies it's insane.Unlike one of the other reviewers, I thought the ending, (after you suffer through the rest of it) actually was somewhat interesting, if not predictable.This movie builds absolutely no suspense & there were zero scares.But overall the film's shot quite nicely.The actors were pretty good with what they had to work with..."
2,???? I Don't Get It ????,"I have to say the beginning of Soul Survivors makes it seem like it's going to be packed with eerie images and spine-tingling effects. I couldn't have been farther from the truth.This movie, about four teenagers that were in a horrifying car wreck, seems to have little or no point at all. Just when you belive the movie is going to dazzle you, it fizzles out instead. It seems to have a slow building plot that never hits a climax. The main character, Cassie, Begins having all of these visions. Are these visions real or just a dream, we unfotunately don't find out until the very end. This movie was a disappointment in the fact that it just doesn't seem to have a point. Maybe it's me, but I just didn't see the story in this movie."
1,Horrible,This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The whole point seemed to be to get teens to watch its creepyness and sex over and over again. Unfortunately for the film makers that didn't work. It wasn't scary but creepy (in the sense that i was wondeing why they had to show us such weird images that made no sense).On top of being creepy it was soooooo slow. Nothing happened until the last 10 minutes of the film.My only question was why such talented actors were in this HORRIBLE movie?
2,"Alright, but Not That Good","This movie was okay. Not very good acting, not a very good script and not very scary. I liked the twist at the end. That was the only thing creative about the movie. The movie just seemed very lacking."
1,YUCK its not the Japanese Uncut Version,I love sailor moon in its orignal japanese form not the edited version. I like uncut dubs not edits. In America This is a kid show. In Japan its an older teen anime for kids 15+ or 13+. Sailor MoonR is finally availble in japanese with subtiles. I ignore sailor moon dubbed and watch the amazing subtile version. Usagi is the BEST.
2,Sailor Moon vs. Prince Diamond,"No Way He look at the Ball, he sadi to his Himself look her Beafuil Eye, Maybe He love Sailor Moon, she was not very happy he feel in love with Sailor Moon, in the Palace he Capture and Kidnap Her to Sailor Moon he grad baecause he want to come with her, he grad her hand, he Capture and Kidnap Her why, He feel in Love one-one by Hero who is not Princess never be Capture or Kidnap.?"
5,In this one,"we learn everything about Neo-Queen Serenity, meaning who she is, and who Rini's parents are!! :laughs: Darien and Serena's faces turn a BRIGHT, bright red:-) In one of the episodes 'The Legened Of The NegaMoon' is where we learn all this, but it's also the one were Prince Diamond tries to make Sailor Moon(Serena)um..fall in love with him. Well of course it doesnt work!!! But I'm gonna skip a part, but when she wakes up you see her in this weird looking, but nice looking dress lol!! It's also funny looking, but it's kinda like the one the Queen weres, so Mr. Prince was trying to make her look like the Queen. I thought it was funny. Also one of the face exsprestions is totally cool! it looks like a real human face! It's when you see a tear fall down her cheek.I know this kinda confused you all, but you should TOTALLY GET THIS ONE!!! It's Awsome! Oh we also meet Sailor Pluto!!:-) Cooleo!"
5,The Gambler,"It was great to see this movie again; don't know why TV stations have not shown it in many years. Kenny Rogers has been a really good singer since his days w/ The First Edition through his switch to country style music & The Gambler theme song is 1 of his best [Ruby is another good song]. Not only is he a good singer, Rogers is a pretty good actor in his role as Brady Hawks too. The supporting actors in The Gambler are also good, & the story keeps your interest throughout. If you like westerns, & don't have The Gambler in your collection, it's a good un'."
3,the gambler,the product was fine except for poor picture. It had alot of scratch markes in the picture indicating that it was and old move and not top of the line recording.
3,The sader but wiser woman for him?,"The confusion for me is what he won in the final confrontation?The railroad gambling action is funand the saloon fights are pretty good too.I think the theme song is maybe the best part of the movie.Otherwise it is just another western that appears to be not all that well written? California and Arizona on the Southern Pacific Rail Roadafter the 1860's wasn't owned by one man?Anyway I liked the movie, but can't give it very high marks for plot."
5,One of the best western style movies I have ever seen,I loved this movie. It was just a down right good movie from beginning to end. Kind of lets you go back to the way things were back in that day.
4,"Lyrics for FOXY-""Get Off/Hot Number""","I post my comment on this about the lyrics of FOXY - ""Get Off/Hot Number"" I am trying to search the lyric which is called ""Madamoiselle"" in the Internet but I am disappointed that it was never found. I for myself am a hearing impaired but I love to listen to the music very much. I do have the LP of Foxy - ""Hot Number"" and I found two CDs of Foxy through Amazon.com so I ordered both of them immediately. And then I listened to each songs. One of the songs I love to listen repeatedly is ""Madamoiselle."" Sighhh! Well, I tried to search the lyric for Madamoiselle but never find it. If any of you know where to find it or will be willing to listen the words of the lyric ""Madamoiselle"" and then post it to one or any of the Internet for lyric. Or can send directly to my email address. But I rather not to put my email address on this because it is very risky and sticky situation. I'd appreciated it very much!Thank you!"
4,A Nice Historical Novel,"I really did enjoy this book very much, the only reason I did not give it five stars is because at times the pace got a little slow. There is not necessarily a happy ending to this story, which I liked. The book was very well researched, I especially enjoyed learning about the art of illumination. So much so, in fact, that I went online and continued doing some research on my own. If you love history, which I do, you will really like this book for all it's historical aspects. The romance lover in me enjoyed the book as well, I especially loved the romances going on with supporting characters, especially Half-Tom and Magda, a part of the story that turned out well for these characters. I also loved the part about Julian the Anchoress. I had never heard of such a thing, an anchoress, until reading this book. Julian had some very revolutionary ideas about feminism and I loved reading about that. All in all, it was a fairly satisfying read and was definitely not a waste of time."
2,A downer of a novel,"Not all fiction needs to be uplifting confirmations of the human spirit or end with the good triumphant and the bad delivered to justice. But the skill level needed to craft one that isn't is considerable and The Illuminator generally fails that skill level. Not many readers, I conjecture, end its four hundred pages saying, ""I just feel better having read this.""Its characters are one dimensional and generally fail to arouse our caring and concern. (There are exceptions.) It's portrayal of the coming Protestant/Catholic split is heavy handed. The plots, and subplots, look good on paper but don't seem to get executed in a timely fashion. A bit of subtlety would have gone a long way."
1,A disappointing book,"Riddled with glaring historical errors this book reads more like a Harlquin romance. Fluffy and at times silly, it falls far short of the hype on the cover and its PR. Surprisingly, nowhere in the reviews or description of this book does it tell you that a central theme weaving through this amateurish tome is the suffering of the jews. The beautiful Illuminator incurred the loss of his noble title and lands because he married a Jewess. The union produces a lovely child, Rose, who is beauty and innocence herself. Against a backdrop of greedy, bloodthirsty Christians scheming and hurting each other, Rose and the noble christian son Colin weave a dewey romance complete with flower-strewn lute lessons in the wool house. The young romance leaves Rose pregnant, mingling christian and jewish blood... All of this makes you wonder how this author got published.... The jewish lesson seems to be the most valuable thing this book has to offer."
5,An Outstanding First Book,"I just finished reading this book and all I can say is WOW! Beautifully written, masterfully edited, this book really gives the modern reader a tiny glimpse into what life in the 1300's was like.In our relatively unchurched society, it is hard to identify with just how central religion was to medieval society. The Bible was not available to the masses, a concept so foreign to us now; the people had to rely upon the clergy, many dishonorable and corrupt. How desparate their lives were! Women were at the mercy of the church, the law, and every unscrupulous male, just about in that order.For those readers who only want to read books with happy endings, this one may not be for you. If you as a reader want to place yourself in the times about which you read, you must get this book. This is realistically written fiction with enough historical research and real characters woven in to imagine it may have really happened."
4,Takes some efftot to put them up but worth it!,"Bought it at good deal with free shipping. However, it was not that easy to put it up. Try to find the beams with a stud and balance the rails. May be it is my own limited knowledge being a ""handyman"" girl. Took me 2 hours to re-adjust & positioning it well.Hint: Not only balancing the supporting rails but also the holes on the hanging rails. Finally got them up! Yeah! Then find out they are too samll for my rubbermaids tubs - well, put all the paper file boxes up and free some of my shelf space for my gardening tool and fertilizers.If you are having regular rubbermaid boxes - forgot about this rack - can hold very small containers & tubs - but worth to put the paper/bankers boxes - they are sturdy and strong.Good value when they are on sale under $30."
3,"Hyloft USA 518 Bin-Max 34-by-36-inch Storage Unit, White",Looks good on paper. Hard to install. Need two people to install and had to buy bigger screw brackets to hold heavier material.Looks good once installed.
1,Junk preamp,"what a piece of junk. the phono sound is completely dead and flat, with no matter how much EQ. The line in is totally useless because its always distorted. I looked inside and saw bad solder joints and rust. I would avoid this manufacturer at all costs"
3,Good play but horrendous typesetting,"The Penguin Classics '01 paperback edition is laden with typographic errors. The spacing between individual letters is inconsistent on numerous occasions, which can be rather jarring to the eyes when ""it"" becomes ""i t"" whereas the rest of the line is densely packed. The typesetter even got the most brilliant idea by turning ""flourish"" into ""∫'tourish"". Although I enjoyed reading the play, my experience was marred by these misprints."
2,Wasn't for me,"I really didn't like this play. While I could respect some of the wittier elements and the Marxist ideals displayed throughout, the actual stuff of the play wasn't enough to hold my interest so that I would stick around to listen to the ideas portrayed. Reading this wasn't any fun at all and I don't think that I'll ever pick it up again."
4,"Great book, Enjoyed it more than I anticipated",I brought this for my required reading in an upper level Economics course and I was thoroughly surprised by how much I actually enjoyed reading it. It's a quick and easy read with a lot of humor. There will be clear favorites among the characters although some of them you will ask yourself why you like them so much. On paper Undershaft is more of an antagonist than anything else but you will find yourself liking him anyways. All in all the themes and issues presented by Shaw's characters are done brilliantly and it's worth more than just one read.
2,Not good,"I didn't like this only because it looked so strange on. Im fairly fit and thin, it was sticking out so far it looked ridiculous on me. Never worn it after trying it on."
5,Jean Grey with Mutated Senator Kelly!,"This is an awsome action figure. With almost perfect articulation. Her arms, are my only problum, they need articulation at the elbows, other than that this toy, of one of my favorite chartecters in the movie, Jean Grey, is a great addition to any X-Men collection! But that Senator kelly thing is just weird! I don't get it. Great toy!"
2,"It says legal when its not the ""legal"" size","I wanted a divider to my legal binder and thought it would be a legal sized paper, very disappointingI wanted a divider to my legal binder and thought it would be a legal sized paper, very disappointing"
1,Not Very good,Bought this..Sound is terrible..Has a white noise during playback of video..The fast forward option is so slow and if you press fast forward in just a little will go back to begining of video..No way to advance video ahead to where you left off..Cant save video position if you turn off must start from begining..Mp3 player is good though..Wish I would of saved money and went with Archos PVR..
1,Bad experience with this one,This is after about 2 weeks of use. It does record alright from video sources. Voice recorder barely works if at all. The front menu is scrambled to where you have to use the manual to know what you are choosing. All recording (video or audio) freezes unit about 50% of the time. Bad sound with internal speakers and very low volume with headphones.I would would warn anyone to stay away from this (from my experience).
4,"Neat little recorder and player, worth more than you paid!","I was looking for something that I could record from tv or a small cctv camera and this thing does it very well. I haven't had any trouble loading the battery, though the battery door is a bit cheesy and probably easily broken if you were pulling the battery in and out, which I don't see myself doing as it keeps a charge long enough for me to get done what I need done or I can keep it tethered to the ac adapter while recording.I'm still testing it's function and find it fairly easy to use. You must use their software to transfer video to the machine (at least if it's saved in something other than asf format). You can drag and drop mp3's to the directory.When you put a card in, the unit creates several subdirectories on it. MP3, Video, Audio etc., The card shows up as a second drive to the internal memory.The screen is very clear and crisp and easy to see. I have had no concerns at all with it so far."
4,Rylant and Teague are a winning combination,"Cynthia Rylant and Mark Teague were a great combination for this book.Mark's rich gouache painting gives the dog life. There is much excitement when the dog runs away from the whole crew.One minor thing is it felt the village continued on forever. It didn't seem to have a rhyme or reason. Perhaps it's because you have to allow for a long chase, yet it has the setting of a village. A difficult balance, for sure. I loved the treatment of the buildings and the small town charm.Cynthia did a great job with brevity yet keeping the text exciting."
2,Illustrations are wonderful...story is not,"I'm a dog-lover and enjoy almost any book about dogs, but this story sounds as if it was written by a second-grade student. The sentences run on and on and on, and the reader is left feeling as if there was no real ending...the story just seems to stop. I've read most of Cindy Rylant's books and have enjoyed many of them, but I must say that I felt sorry for Mark Teague having to illustrate a book that lacked so much. A real disappointmet."
2,No hardware,"Didn't ship with any hardware, but then again, most marine products don't. I'd recommend making sure you have a solid through-bolt to secure them, they are a little flimsy and a self tapping screw will strip out."
4,Great tool.,The book Apostle of the Crucified Lord is a great tool to be used when examining Paul's letters. It really help to understand the times that they were written in and the culture in the days of early Christianity. I am currently using the book for a college theology class and I also know of two other universities using it for the same class.
3,Apostle of the Crucified Lord,"Decent look at Paul, but definitely not from a Conservative point of view. I found it frustrating at times, and a bit verbose."
5,My Children Love The Broadway Kids,"After owning The Broadway Kids orginal album, we were hooked. We bought the ""At the Movies"" hoping it was just as good, and boy is it! My children sing and dance and act like zoo animals when listening to ""Talk to the Animals"". My 3 and 1/2 year old now picks up the play phone and calls ""Ghostbusters""! What joy this CD brings to my family...and my husband and I don't mind listening to it either (the kids have great voices)!"
4,A Moment With the Moments/The Other Side of The Moments,"A Moment With the Moments have a lot of really great selections from the late 60's and early 70's that are tuned beautifully and soothing to the soul. Billy Brown leads on the majority during the first half of this cd using his oh so sweet, sensual tenor/felsetto voice. The second half of this cd was designed to please those with a classy, big band, orchestra style taste in mind. Sammy Lowe add a taste of honey to this unique and certainly different style of music for the Moments."
1,Too Large,"I ordered a 36D in this bra/camisole, which is usually a perfect fit for me. But the cups were unusually large in circumference, far too big for an average D fit. That said, the fabric certainly would provide firm support, and it was very well-made."
4,Not bad but not quite it,"Bras are such a personalized fit item that it can be hard to shop for them online . Overall I'm pleased as the elastic rides very little and the bra is secure. The cup size is too big but not enough to send it back. It's very pretty and doesn't shrink (I tried). I will probably order another in a smaller size since it's the best I've tried in this price range. Also, it doesn't really hide the bulges but that may be because it's too big."
5,great product,"This was exactly what I wanted. Bali bras have always offered the best fit for me so I knew what size I needed. It fits great and I wear it several days a week. I gained several pounds recently due to a stressful move, but didn't want to invest in a new wardrobe as I figured the weight might come off once things settled down. This cami helped those too-snug pants and skirts sit much more comfortable on my waistline. I also like that the built-in bra made for a smooth back in tighter shirts. It has a nice, silky texture that doesn't cling to my shirts. Just wish it came in a beige color."
3,so close...,"The cup size for 36B was too big for me, and unfortunately B is as small as they come. Otherwise, I'd keep it- much better control than the Flexee's shaping cami."
2,Sorry Jamie,"I purchased this because of my respect for Mr. Oliver. I am dumbfounded as to how T-Fal and Jamie created a pan where no matter how much oil or butter is used the food ""sticks"".The pan has hot spots and cannot be used to fry eggs. I recommend the non-stick surface or avoiding this brand altogether."
1,Smells Awful,"I had no idea what this smelled like, but at 75% off, I figured ""what the heck""? Boy was I wrong...this stuff is awful."
3,Oops.,"These seem like good quality sheets. However, I was disappointed that there were no pillow cases included. Silly me did not read closely enough. I simply looked at the accompanying picture and, lo and behold, there are PILLOW CASES with these very same sheets. I think that is slightly tricky. From now on, perhaps, one should consider picturing the actual product. Also, from now on I shall be more careful.Debbie Case"
3,OK for the price but worse than wamsutta set,"I have a Wamsutta set and was very impressed about how soft and silky the 300 thread count cotton sheet would be, thus when Martex 300 thread count set on sale I ordered one. However, although this set is OK for its price, it's not 100% cotton and rather rough to the touch. Will definitely avoid this brand later."
5,These are great sheets!,I just love these sheets! The color I purchased (Heather) is exactly what I was looking for. They continue to feel soft and keep their color. They even fit my Tempur-Pedic mattress with no problems.
1,Martex sheets,"These sheets appear to be seconds. I washed them and the fitted sheet is loose and will not stay put. I saved a few bucks, but the sheets are not as good quality as the Martex I purchased at Macy's. I would skip this deal in the future!!!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!,"The fitted sheet for the Martex 300 thread count king sheet set is too big for a king bed. It was definitely made wrong. Unfortunately I read the other reviews too late. They too had problems with this sheet. Obviously, DO NOT BUY IT!!!"
2,"Great feeling, BUT!!!","I can only tell you the truth. The sheets are a beautiful burgundy color and feel great. Until the first and every single wash since. I love them and I can't see wasting the money, however I would NOT recommend these. When these are washed and dried EVERYTHING in the washer (including the washer was burgundy. That eventually just has washed out. My carpet, dryer and garbage cabinet are forever RED! It appears that they never stop lightly shedding and loosing color. However they never seem to fade. When we want the burgundy towels brightened up, we just wash them with the sheets. I would love to get them to stop shedding and discoloring, however they have been washed over 12-15 times and it doesn't stop. So.. I would reconsider spending the money on them as it is a neverending cleanup! And will discolor all you appliances and anything around them."
3,"Good Price, Good Product","Good quality for the price. I did notice that the fitted sheet seemed too big for the mattress. I'm used to the snug fit that you get on queen size bed. I like the tauntness. I'm not sure if this extra material was purposeful so that one could use the same sheets on a Cal King bed. Either way, it's not that big of a deal. I'm just happy that I have a new king size bed!"
1,Martex 300 thread count king sheets,"I was expecting cotton 300 thread count, instead I got 60% cotton 40% polyester. It was not a pleasant surprise. Nor was the short time allowed for returns."
3,its ok for what you pay,"Its not 300 Thread soft let me tell you , its OKbut it does come with pillow cases.Not what I was specting"
4,Great deal!,I was impressed with these sheets and the deal I received. They work great for when friends come in from out of town and they love the feel of these. I have friends coming to town all the time and I'm definitely going to buy a few more sets!
3,Just A Bit Off,"These sheets are nice and soft as one would expect of 300 thread count. No problem there. The color was different than I expected from the picture, Goldenrod is a tannish yellow. They look better out of package than in. I'm returning the unopened Navy set, though the color is right. My real problem is the fit. I have a good hotel mattress and a memory foam topper, but the fitted sheet is way too big. I'm realy disappointed, particularly that I didn't open the Navy first. Amazon customer service, as always, was wonderful to deal with."
4,great sheets,purchased these sheets thinking i was getting a great buy but didn't read all the information first you have to purchase the pillowcases separately and they cost as much as the sheets so be smarter then i was read the print and order the pillowcases separately for a total cost of 39.98
4,Nod bad,"We have the goldenrod king sheets. They fit our deep california king just fine, and they're nice. Not great, but pretty much what I'd expect from 300 count."
4,value for money!!!!,I bought 3 sets of this sheet set. I washed them and used them and they come out softer after every wash.I wish the pillow case were included too.4 stars coz I cant find the matching pillow cases.
2,Disappointed,"I bought these sheets thinking what a bargain. Well you get what you pay for. These sheets are soft, but they are so flimsy I can almost see through them. Not what you would expect from 300 ct. sheets. My 180 count sheets from Target are better than these sheets! The color didn't rub off, but it was definatley not the color I was expecting. I ordered the ""silver blue"", and got sheets that are ""powder blue"". The fitted sheet is ""deep"", too deep. I have an 18"" mattress and the sheet is still loose. My advice... don't waste your money one these sheets!"
2,NOT SOFT AT ALL,"Was very unhappy with these sheets. They are very rough to the touch, not like you would think 300 count sheets should feel. They have deep pockets but other than that, they're not your best sheets. I liked the sateen sheets though. They were very soft. Will not order these sheets ever again."
2,I wouldn't recommend........,"Fabric is just ok, a little on the thin side. My main problem is the fit and stitching. Terrible fit on my deep pillow top. I think you would have to have a 24"" thick mattress for these to fit. I was really disappointed with the stitching, they almost look hand sewn. Poor quality. Even at $20, not a good bargain."
3,Very deep,"This book is deep and philosophical, definitely not light reading. But, I think the chapters on worship are good."
2,"I did get the right book, but.....",What we received in the mail was not the same cover as what I saw on the website. The book photograph copyright date is from 1992. I realize that I just got myself an old and used book for the price I would pay for a newer used book. I'm sure that there is a more current book (which I thought I was ordering). I only got the older edition plus the pages are yellowish. I would have gotten the new edition if I were given a choice.
1,Please don't buy this book.,This is the worst book I have ever spent my money on. I would ask for my money back just out of principle but the hassle wouldn't even be worth it. I won't even go into why it was so bad...I will just tell you to save your money.
1,Safety Concern,"If you have purchased this product in the clear, please check it right away. I purchased 4 rolls of this product. I paid to have it installed on a deck and fence. It looked very nice. After 3 months it started to crumble and fall apart. It looked fine, but if you touched or pushed on it, it would fall apart in your hands. I contacted Unbeatable Sales about it. They wrote me back and told me to contact the product's company because the 30 day period was over and they could not help me. I did contact the company. Thank goodness the company was more helpful than Unbeatable Sales. They said they had problems with this product and I should have been contacted by Unbeatable Sales. I assured them that NO one had contacted me. I was sent replacements in the black color. Now I will have to pay to have it installed again. Of course this does not make me very happy! Last of all, I am very happy I did not have anyone fall through the railings because of the problem with the product."
4,EEEasEEE,It's hard to fault a product that does what it says and does it consistently. That is the case with the cool2 laminator and associated supplies. No waiting for a hot seal machine; no problem with the carrier; in fact; no problem at all!How very refreshing!
3,Wet and secure,"I got one of these at a Disney water park 3 years ago and it is a must-have item to take to the pool. I can put a non-electronic door-only car key on the ring and lock my electronic keys in the car. It will not keep the contents dry, but it will keep them secure. Our pool IDs, car key, and cash are with me, not left for any thief to grab. The carabiner hooks to my swimsuit shoulder strap though I use the lanyard, too.After 3 years, the clasp is starting to break, so I'm ordering another. I'd give it 5 starts if it kept the contents dry, but since water won't hurt money, plastic IDs, or a metal car key, it meets my needs."
4,"Dry Money, Wet Passport","My only qualm is that this surfsafe is too small to hold a passport. It looks good, keeps money and credit cards safe, and didn't break, but I need something to hold my passport as well."
2,Big enough for what?,This is a neat item but so very very small. It has only the capacity for maybe banknotes and a credit card but it cannot accommodate a modern car key - the ones with the remote functions for the central locking and security system - precisely the item most in need of keeping dry.
3,Does Work,A bit bigger than expected and clumsy to wear in the pool to keep my pedometer in. For my intent it didn't fill the bill but it is as described. I should have read the description a little more closely.
1,not what I expected,It was smaller than I wanted. My big complaint was the description did not contain the dementions. It was not big enough to hold my fitbit.
5,"Rich lather, light scent","I'm really pleased with this shave foam. I have been switching between shave gel and a non-foaming shave cream, and this is the best among all I've been using. The foam builds a rich lather that's very moisturizing and provides excellent glide. It has a lightweight feel, so it doesn't cause any clogging issues with my razor and it's easy to wash off. This does have a fragrance, but like most Nivea products, it's light and not overpowering like some brands (lookin' at you, Gillette). Worth a try!"
1,first,"have not seen it but did see the first one and it really stunk, even though it did have robert englund"
1,Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen!!,I have never seen such a bad movie in all my years. I have seen close to a 1000 movies and this was by far the worst. I feel bad for anyone that rented it or even bought it before they saw it. The only thing scary about this movie is that someone actully thought it was good enough to be released. The first movie was actully good this was just a disgrace to the movie industry.
1,HORRIBLE SEQUEL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,The Mangler II was a horrible film! It had nothing to do with the original Mangler movie. This movie was definately a waste of my time and MONEY!!!!
2,Some good parts but....,"An insult to the Mangler series, to much techno running, some of the kills were cool ideas but all gore was cut out and it was done off screen....every kill was off screen actually....Come on morons it's a Mangler movie! Lance did his art well for what it was, but other than that this movie was kinda crap."
1,Expect greatness and you will be sorely disappointed.,"One doesn't have to look hard to find a better movie than The Mangler 2. I would bet that closing your eyes and grabbing a movie off the shelf is a safer bet. That said, if you're up early in the morning and it shows up on tv, watch it if there's absolutely nothing better on. This movie is as absolutely corny as 'horror' can get, but it doesn't aim any higher than the bottom of the bargain bin. This is a late nite piece of trash that doesn't take into account any remote sense of logic, but that is its charm. It's sorely predictable, yet fun. I found it so extraordinarily ridiculous that it was worth waiting through the dribble for the next insanely contrived death scene. Just when you think the plot can't possibly get any worse, it does. So, if for some reason you don't mind sitting through cliche after cliche, watch this movie, but dear god do not pay any money for it.For *good* trash see any Troma or Fulci movie."
1,G-Rated Slasher flick?! What's the point?,"Have you ever heard about those services that edit out all the ""questionable parts"" of a movie so that ""moral, unpstanding"" people can ""enjoy"" them? Have I used enough ""Quotation marks"" already in this ""review""? I bring this up because this ""horor"" movie reminds me of one of those edited masterpieces after the editors have finished it off, except this movie was that bland and uneventful to begin with. I knew I was in trouble when the kids were joking about porn titles and they used the most hackneyed, unoriginal and tame parodies of porn titles I'd ever heard. Come on guys, you can't even think up an interesting or funny porn title parody? They used old ones that have been around for years. And they committed the cardinal sin of B-movies: It wasn't stupid, it was BORING!And Oh Lance Henriksen! You used to make movies like ""Man's Best Friend"" and ""Near Dark"". Didn't anyone ever teach you to invest?"
5,Great quality!!,"It will take a lot for me to switch brands. Won't even wear sunglasses, unless they are my Maui Jims."
5,Awesome sunglasses,"These are the best sunglasses on the market. I love my wayfarer ray-bans, but these are a cut above. When you look through the lenses, it makes the world ""pop"" in terms of color. Even on a dull day, or if you're feeling down or blue, go outside and put these on, and they really lift your mood, just by making the world look a little brighter. Not sure how they do it, but its for real. The sides curve around a little, too, to offer sun protection on the sides, really great feature that I don't have on my beloved wayfarers!"
5,YaY!!,I had been wanting a pair of Maui Jims for a long time and I could finally afford to get them here! I've been wearing mine for over a year now and LOVE them. They're very comfortable and colors just seem to 'pop' (wait until you see reds). I highly recommend them. I showed them to a male coworker and he now owns the same pair! They're unisex. GET THEM FROM THIS VENDOR.
4,Good glasses.,I liked the stingray glasses very much and it fits my rather large head quite nicely. The only qualms i have with it is it tends to fog up on me on one side. The glass though have so far lasted quite well in the year i have had them.
1,Overpriced and overrated,"fail to see the universal appeal of this brand. The designs are poor copies of classic Ray-Ban styles like the ""Balorama"" or ""Clubmaster,"" at twice the price. All I can think of is that Ray-Ban is too ""retro"" or ""your Dad's sunglasses"" which of course, they are supposed to be. ""Maui Jim"" will always remind me of $5 ""Panama Jack"" available at any drugstore."
5,Excellent resource for reading God's Word.,"Without knowing which eight translations this volume contained I took a chance and bought it anyway. I'm not regretting it! This volume contains the following eight New Testament translations:- King James 1611, Living, J.B. Phillips, RSV, Good News, NIV, Jerusalem Bible, New English Bible. It's a great way to see how the various teams of scholars have translated from the Greek. It helps enormously to get the real meaning out by glancing through these translations which are all presented across the opened page. I recommend it"
2,Bad DVD disks,"Watched Blue Heelers for years on DirecTV - Bought Season 3 last year - played well- Purchased Season 4 in June from same seller. Package looks the same but disks are smudged or scratched and stall and stop player. Not the same quality. Returning for replacement. We love this series and hope to buy many more if we get good disks. Have Pioneer all Zone DVD player bought for 2 other British TV series purchased from Amazon.Blue Heelers - Season Four - 11-DVD Set ( Blue Heelers - Season 4 ) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.4 Import - Australia]"

1,The other reviewer was being too kind,The other reviewer was being too kind in their review of this video. The doofus who made this video is a complete nob. I can't think of his name but I have seen 3 of his programs and cannot believe anyone would release them. They are all bad but hilarious to watch. The guy is so gullable. What's even funnier is some of the people he interviews seem to know this and take advantage of it.
3,Ok,"Mine was listed as new but wasn't in packaging and didn't have the carabiner. the fit was good, 30gb video slides in easily and the 60gb is snug. the clickwheel protector is a little thick; would have been better if it had the clickwheel protector from their acrylic series. It would be nice to not have to unclip the strap to charge or sync. All in all an ok alternative to the hardshell cases."
2,It's okay for the price,It ain't the best. If you want something that looks good then find something else.This does the job of protecting the ipod and it's aiite looking.You probably will never use it to keep your ipod standing.I bought it when it was on sale for $1But it looks to be $5 now.Just buy something else with that money
2,Can't stand this,"I received this item as a gift. It doesn't hold the ipod well while in the kickstand mode. The bottom strap must be removed to access the lower port. To set it up in kick stand mode, you need to remove the ipod at least half way. Your movie will kill the battery before the movie will end, and there is no way to charge while watching with this case in kickstand mode."
3,it's okay but...,"while the swiping action is pretty good, the snarl is not so good.basicly all that happens is their foreheads bulge, and their mouths open.wolverine looks like he's chewing gum, and sabretooth just looks downright weird.to tell the truth the only reason to get these toys is if you can't get the single pack version."
4,Nice figures,"I just got this great action figures and well they were really cool, they really look like the characters from the movie becuase of the nice amount of details and they are pretty well articulated. You can create some nice action poses with them. Besides wolvy Vs Sabretooth what else is better than that!"
3,"""I'll Laugh At Your Funeral!""...","A beautiful scientist travels to a remote castle in order to assist a mysterious Baron w/ his experiments in regenerating dead tissue. Unfortunately, there's also a maniacal murderer on the loose, killing off the local women! Gothic and rather slow, SCREAM OF THE DEMON LOVER is far more sedate than it's title might imply, though it does have its moments. The final revelation, while not a big surprise, is well done, and makes up for some of the preceding tedium. Worth a watch..."
4,could not put it down,excellent story of control; a mother who has it and a daughter who wants it at any cost even if that price is death.
2,A Below Average Calculator From Hewlett Packard,"1) This calculator is slow. Any operations require a fraction of second for it to ""think"".2) It only comes with very few e-lessons. No more e-lessions available from HP web sites.3) The infrared port is useless. I couldn't share data or programs with anyone. Very few people are using this calculator.4) The cable which allow this calculator connects to PC sold seperately."
5,HP-39G an alternative to the TI-83,"It's a very good calculator for the money. The most redeeming feature is the usable memory, it's 10 times the size of TI-83 and the functions are more intuitive. The only down side is this particular model doesn't have a backup battery but I downloaded 39g manual and problem was fixed in later iterations."
2,very uncomfortable,I bought these to wear at work because I do a lot of walking and I wanted flat shoes. I walked 1 block and I immediately got blisters on both my feet.
3,"Good action, bad acting.","Jalal Merrhi definately is getting better with each production, however Billy should stick to Tae-Bo. I saw a familiar face in the student who does the Nun-Chuk routine. This actor (Joseph Clark) is making a dominant appearance in action films and on Canadian Television. He also appears in ""Expect to Die"" in which he has a brilliant performance as a kidnapper. The babe in this film was pretty hot. The Tarzan guy was miscat."
1,So FUNNY,"You will laugh until you die! Billy ""shootin"" Blanks teams up with that worthless French dude (it's freedome-fu now) to beat up evil ""cyber criminals"" as he puts it. So funny."
2,"lots of action, little quality","This movie had some great stuff in it. The movie had about 20 fight scenes and neat special effects. The problem is that about half the fight scenes are down right horrible. They're slow they use dumb moves, the actors overact the pain and all the fights in the seacond half of the movie are so poorly choreographed that I want to fast forward and get back to the plot. I think they switched choreogrophers somwhere in the middle. It is a good movie with some good fights and some bad ones. bits of it are creative. other times it's unbearably boring"
2,Cut price Wesley Snipes and Steven Seagal dodge baddies.,"Expect No Mercy is watchable only as a late night video fodder.Aside from that,it's a repetitive and nonchalent load of running,jumping and kicking."
1,Simply Awful,"This is the worst software product that I have ever used! I tried to use it to prepare for the GMAT, but it is a complete joke. At least 1/3 of the problems that I reviewed had typos or other errors. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT. I REPEAT, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT."
3,Taylor's Learning Math Collection,"This math CD contains as many problems as possible, more than 100,000! Problems and solutions can be copied edited within Microsoft Word documents so I can create worksheets which help practicing. In my opinion this CD-ROM is essential for students and teachers dealing with math. Congratulations to the publishers!"
1,worst film of all time,"I have seen many bad films. I have suffered through poor acting senseless plots and crappy scripts. But never in my life have I seen such a vile worthless waste of my time and money as this so called ""comedy"". Not one member of the audience laughed even once. And half got up and walked out. Unfunny film about ugly stupid and unpleasant characters. No redeeming value whatsoever. Every existing negative should be burned. Send Kornbluth to Afghanistan as a weapon of mass destruction. Did I make myself clear?"
4,What a hoot!,"My husband and I saw ""Haiku Tunnel"" last night, and what fun it was! Josh has achieved quite an accomplishment as writer, director, and actor, along with his brother Jacob and John Bellucci. The casting was perfect, with performances from Warren Keith, Sarah Overman, Brian Thorstenson, Amy Resnick, June Lomena, Harry Shearer, and the divine Helen Shumaker. Great job, Josh!!"
1,"Run, run away fast.","This movie was so bad I couldn't finish it. I have watched some bad movies before, but I always hold out hoping there will be some redeeming quality I can find. Because of this, there are few movies that I can honestly say I could not finish. But this is one of the most asininely moronic movies that could not be funny even if it tried (which it does, very very hard). The movie tries for a droll dry humor at several times but sadly falls more into a traumatic train wreck that is so bad you can't stand to watch the destruction. If you are thinking about buying this, don't. Rent it first to see if it is something for you."
2,"weird, moronic, slightly humorous","I think there's a reason few people have ever seen this. Parts of it are a bit funny - the BOSS from HELL, the resignation that isn't accepted, the mistaken identity - but I found most of it downright stupid. I've never known anyone older than maybe 13 who would think such behavior was appropriate."
2,Not all that funny,"I enjoyed the movie ""Office Space"" and the series called ""Office"" so I thought this movie ""Haiku Tunnel"" would be just as funny. Well, I was wrong. There are some parts that are funny. They are all in the movie trailer. The rest of the movie is just a series of watching Josh walking through his day at the law firm. My recommendation, is to rent this movie and if you think it is funny. [..]"
2,Unfulfilled Promise,"If you're thinking you've stumbled upon a more zen rendition of ""Office Space"", think again. The jacket would lead you to believe you've found a funny & clever working place story, but more than likely you'll be waiting for humor to shoot into orbit, when in reality it simply sputters on the launching pad. The premise seems to hold validity as a funny scenario - successful temp becomes chaotic perm - but the writing and directing are a bit too amateurish to pull it all off. Josh Kornbluth is able to entertain, but only in spurts during the film. Some of it is very predictable, once you get going, and from there on you're waiting for something that just never happens. The only thing you'll be concentrating on is why the heck isn't he mailing the letters? The supporting cast does a very credible job, specifically the head secretary, the lawyer who Josh works for, and the female lawyer he trysts with. The rest is pretty much forgettable."
1,Haiku Tunnel is TORTURE to watch not COMEDY,"This movie ranks up there with Ishtar and Mr. Saturday Night as ""comedies"" that I will never watch again. If it came down to watching this movie again or jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge, I'd take suicide. If you can go 20 minutes without looking at your watch then congrats. It did have a good soundtrack though but that doesn't make up for psuedo-comedy. It's worse than the skits currently on Saturday Night Live. I think it is funny how this movie has Sundance creds printed on the box. Everyone at Sundance must of been high that day because this movie is horrid. Who greenlighted this bad film? They should be fired."
1,...,"This is an awful movie. It is so bad, that I felt bad for the guy who wrote it and starred in it. I had to turn it off after 25 minutes. If you are thinking about buying this movie, I have a suggestion. Take the [money], and light it on fire. Watching it burn will be more fun, and a better use of your money."
1,GIVE ME MY TWO HOURS BACK!,"I would have given this movie a .25 star but that wasnt an option- plus after sitting through that movie, i figured i should do something nice by giving a FULL star! This movie not only dissapointed me, but made me wish i could get my time back in order to do something productive such as twiddle my thumbs and read the dictionary. If you are thinking of renting this video do not waste the calories running out to blockbuster. And if you were thinking of buying the video or dvd, find a homeless person on the street and buy him dinner! (Or at the very least open your window and watch it fly!) Basically this movie lowered my IQ while wasting my time. DO NOT BOTHER!"
4,"Soooo 1995, but very funny","Very funny office comedy, circa 1995 (i.e., before the internet boom). Sure Josh Kornbluth plays himself and he knows he's funny, but his take on the minutae of life and office work is so accurate that it's laugh-till-you-cry funny for those of us who have done temp work. One of the best moments in the film is when Josh's new boss advises him to: ""go back to your office, calm down, focus, and catch up!"" (complete with hand signals). The supporting actors and characters are somewhat underused in the shadow of Josh's foibles, but they are still very funny. At least rent this movie, then judge for yourself."
5,The funniest movie I've seen in two years,This movie is hilarious. Unfortunately it is in limited release in the theaters so may be hard to see. It has special significance if you have ever worked as a temp office worker. This movie is well worth seeing. Bring someone you like to laugh with.
1,Worst Movie I've Ever Seen,"This is without question the worst movie I've ever seen. I've never written a review for Amazon before, and may never again, but I so hated this terrible, excruciating drivel that I felt obligated to warn you as a public service. I saw this movie more than two years ago and it still enrages me by how bad it is.Josh Kornbluth, who apparently plays himself in a completely unendearing manner, should never make another movie.I cannot express with mere words how bad this film is. Please, don't have anything to do with this movie and you will hopefully live a long, happy life unhaunted by this unfunny, irritating loser."
1,Haiku Tunnel,"A laugh track would have helped me know what parts were supposed to be funny. I rented this movie with a free coupon from a local rental store and I feel like I was ripped off. I can't imagine how people who paid to see this must feel, much less the poor saps that wasted the money to produced this thing. I've seen bad movies before, but this is ridiculous.I feel bad that someone might read this and feel intrigued enough to rent and watch this movie. This isn't one of those bad (good) movies. It is just a waste of time. This is the kind of movie that if you rent it and invite friends over, you will be the butt of jokes for weeks to come."
3,Batteries have a experation date for next month.,"The batteries are in the original packaging. Haven't tried or tested the batteries yet, but I'm sort of baffled where the ad say's it's new, but the experation date is dated Jan 2013? That's not new. Some one tried to scratch the 2013 out, but you can still make it out. I need these batteries for February. New batteries don't expire in one month of shelf life. Amazon should make battery sellers, put the experation date also, so we know how fresh the batteries are, before we buy. I'm not happy about this."
5,Excellent,"This is a factual book that goes into detail about what happened to the Osage Indians. It's very well written.My grand daughter, wanting to tell the story, used it for her main source in a history project.She found it easy to understand, and it was of great value to her. I had read it before, but we purchased a copy just for her use."
5,Wonderful World of Gambling,"This book was of those I wanted to read slowly to enjoy. The description of the betting business was a real eye opener. These guys really understand the betting world, both the legal and illegal. They opened up a world to me that was not on my radar screen. You really get the sense that they have been involved with characters that are part of this world.I strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to get inside the world of gambling or just wants a great read."
5,Greatness,I loved this. Tryggvi Magnusson is a great man. His wondrous innovations in flooring have been wonders for the industry.
5,Strong,Be careful not to overdo this Woman's Energy tea; it is quite potent and it could give you a headache. The tea is very fresh with quality ingredients and has a pleasant taste. It also has an aphrodisiac effect that is surprising.I wasn't expecting that.
4,Pretty Good!,"I just got this tea literally two days ago so I can't give it a five star as of yet. I suffer from amenorrhea (look it up) and I'm scared to pieces about drinking this tea. But I need it to balance out my hormones in hopes that all my natural processes along with mental clarity. The tea is DELICIOUS! I add about 2 teaspoons of honey and then continue to steep. It's much better than the other tea's I've had, even my beloved Chai tea.Shipping was fast; though another order I put in with Swanson got returned for some reason and the processing took a little longer than I would have liked. But the customer service was excellent and I will be ordering from them again!"
4,It's Ok,"this tea is ok but I prefer Moon cycle, it's better. its smells good taste good, in overall is a good tea."
5,Excellent tea for hormonal imbalance-related issues,"After getting off the pill (used for 10 years), I started getting very short periods with painful cramps and migraines plus terrible hormonal cystic breakouts 10 days before the period starts. Just one cup two days before my period immediately cured the headache and the cramps. I'm not sure about it's effect on the breakouts yet but I'll keep drinking it a cup everyday. The tea makes me sleepy if I drink it at night and gives me a boost if I drink it during the day. It's odd. I don't understand why anybody would think this tea tastes bad. It has cinnamon, ginger, orange peel, stevia in it and these are pretty much what I taste in this tea. It tastes yummy. I recommend this for all women who have hormonal imbalance. This and castor oil seems to be the only things that has helped me so far."
5,Women's Energy Tea!!,"Good tea!! I'm chinese, and it contains alot of herbs that are very nourishing for the female reproductive system. There's a chinese version that's similar and they charge for 10x more."
2,Boring,"Very nice place, but for me the yoga secuence is very boring, nothing really creative, I much prefer her Shakti DVD, better value for money."
3,Full of Parodies (Episode 25-28),"In the whole seris of Nadia TV animation, Vol.7 is not as great as the rest of the series, having full of jokes from Japanese animation or Japanese monster movies such as Gamela, Godzilla or Ultraman series.Basic idea comes from Jules Verne's novel MYSTERIOUS ISLAND with some of borrowed settings. Nadia's unpredictable character runs wild and make-believe of heroines Hayao Miyazaki created can also be found (particularly NAUSICAA). Overall you can skip it if you purchase the series individually so I recommend to have second volume of Box series to see these slow and rather peaceful (no gargoyle attacks) episodes with the exception of personal brawls.Verdict: Nadia's In Mysterious IslandRating: 68 out of 100Recommended for: Die-hard Nadia fans. I recommend second volume of Box series containing the latter half of Nadia episodes."
5,Good investment book by Tyson,"This book is especially good for beginners. I bought this for my son and daughter-in-law along with Millionaire Next Door.Tyson covers all the bases and writes in an easy to understand and enjoyable manner. Even if you are not new to investing, you will learn a thing or two.Also recommend Millionaire Next Door and Rich Dad, Poor Dad."
5,Great for us idiots out there!!!,It gave me so much to think about. I know that my steps to getting rich were turned into leaps with this book.
1,Negative Negative Negative,"I bought this hoping to get some basic info on investing and all it seemed to reflect on is what not to do. His advice on not buying individual stocks was somewhat insulting. He constantly writes about how no one reading the book could have the expertise to pick stocks like the ""pro's"" and should only buy mutual funds after years of research. The ""years"" part is snitty on my behalf but that's the kind of feeling you get from his positions.In summary of what I got out of this, we are all too uninformed to do anything other than pay off our credit cards and then possibly, with correct research, put that extra $50 a month into a mutual fund. Buy ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"" before you buy this and THEN see if you still want to purchase it."
3,A GOOD BASIC INVESTMENT QUIDE,"I enjoyed this book and found the investment information certaintly more practical and useful than what I found in Jane Bryant Quinn's ""Make the Most of Your Money"", that book, leave alone.I disagree with the author suggesting that you mimic the stocks in top mutual funds though. Just buy the mutual funds. Mutual funds are safer than stocks (check out LU, CPQ, CPN, KM) and the no load funds don't charge a commission. I also recommend ETF's.The author does a good job explaining on how to find and pick a good mutual fund and is definitely a better read than Quinn's book."
5,Sincere,Given as a graduation gift to a young lady who was interested in photography. I was looking for something that would not only show the beauty of the world but the beauty of the Creator. She loved it!
2,Doesn't work well.,"I've played with versions of this that really stop and turn around quite fast and long. This one barely turns the opposite way at all, lil disappointing."
1,This one goes back to Borders,"This book seems terribly-babyish and boring, as if it is intended for a 10yr old to read.The worst Sci-Fi I've ever read."
5,Many songs are nothing less than astonishing.,This is another fine example of Eric's versatile blues style and live recordings. A must for all Clapton fans or not.
3,once again,A great artist but recently he keeps releasing different albums with variations of the same work. Please let's hear some new work from this brillant talent!
3,AN OK COMPILATION,"This is an OK compilation of EC's blues material over his carrer. I was, however, disappointed in the lack of previously unreleased and live material. If you're new to Clapton and want only his historically bluesy stuff than this is the disc to get, otherwise pass on this one."
3,Mediocre At Best,"I'm a big Clapton fan, but this album was somewhat disappointing to me. A bunch of rehashed outtakes, buy ""Just One Night"" for the real deal. Hey Eric- how about an album from the ""Live Now"" video-my favorite."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this cd because I love the blues and because when he's ""on"" nobody plays the blues like Clapton. However, the material on this cd must be considered ""archival"" at best. If you have to have everything Clapton has released, buy it. Otherwise, move on. I found it a pretty mediocre example of his work."
3,Clapton plays some good blues.,"This is a good album of blues tunes. But didn't Eric already do one like this(""From the Cradle"")? Good stuff that Buddy,Jimmy V.,and the rest from that SRV tribute could do just as well. I guess I don't like Erics' transformation into rock guy for the middle-age casual music consumer."
1,Clapton At His Worst,"If you've ever thrilled to how moving Clapton can be when he plays the blues, this album will disappoint you. Here he is lazy. He misses his cues. Its not pretty. This album is archival material at best...if you have to own everything Clapton ever did, buy it..otherwise, move on."
2,Huge Clapton Fan disappointed,"I'm a huge clapton fan from his earlier works with Jack Bruce in Cream, to his unplugged album. Being a musicain myself what I really found disgusting is Clapton's use of a drum machine. The drummer is the fondation of a band and gives the basic feel and life to the song. The drum machine, which has no feel, takes away all life from his songs and frankly makes me want to puke. I can't listen to this album with out getting a synthetic feel from his studio CD. I especially find this irritating coming from a blues master, in which blues is supposed to be all about soul. I hope this isn't becoming a trend for Eric, seeing how he used the same dum machine and technican in his album ""Pilgrum."" For someone who claims to be a blues ""purist"" he sure doesn't seem to take the same ""pure"" attitude when it comes to his supporting cast. EC, if you stubble apon this letter of retribution, for the love of God and music please keep it real."
4,70's-80's Clapton Blues,"Most of this music was taken from Clapton's 1970s-1980s albums such as BACKLESS, OCEAN BLVD, and one take from the LAYLA sessions.More produced than a blues fan is used to, but these are fine tunes. Elmore James' ""The Sky Is Crying,"" Bo Diddley's ""Before You Accuse Me,"" as well as ""Alberta,"" and ""Early In The Morning"" are very enjoyable.The reason for aquiring this set, though, is the second Live disk. Taken mainly from mid 70s performances, these takes smoke throughout. The standouts include ""Driftin' And Drifin'"" ""Stormy Monday,"" ""Kindhearted Woman"" and ""Have You Ever Loved A Woman."" The whole second disk alone is worth the purchase price.Recommended, but the bulk of this music is available on other albums."
1,five stars?,"I disagree,with the five star review. G. Herrick's one star review is the right one on this product. Amazon lets sellers list products that are old stock or surplus. the prices listed are not always real and when people place orders they expect to get brand new fresh product. Amazon may or may not help people with these orders. I have been disappointed by Amazon being the middleman in to many products.The rule of thumb is if the price looks to good it usually is. I am very disappointed in Amazon for doing this. E-bay is E-bay, I expect more from Amazon."
1,NEVER do business with this company,"Ordered over a month ago, 5 emails through Amazon, no answer to any of them no help from Amazon, no product. Don't know if my card may be charges at any moment. Lost my cutomers order due to no ink available for this older printer. I used to be a big Amazon customer now I don't know"
5,Great prices,"We purchased these to replace the OME parts, they helped with the fuel milage and the lights on the dash went out."
4,"Cheesy, but interesting....","No doubt about it...this film is very outdated BUT that's what's great about it! Considering when it was made, I thought it was a decent 80's horror/comedy film. Vinnie Durand is an obssessed fan of scream queen, Janna Bates. He follows her around, tapes her, dreams about her, thinks about her all day long....he basically lives and breathes her. BUT she does not even know he's alive. He desperately wants to make a movie with her, but no one is giving him a chance to get near her....Vinnie won't stop trying though! During all this, several murders are being committed. Each victim (who is part of the film crew) receives a letter saying, ""you have made your last horror film....goodbye!"" Then dies...Overall, I thought it was OK. Joe Spinell's performance was good...the others were from OK-bad. I am a big fan of 80's horror flicks/80's films...even the cheesiest ones, so I liked it."
4,a man who make history,"this is a great biography, but doesn't revealed the politics of the voictorian age, is a minus of it.the former of a caracter is well described , because the India experience, the caracter is showed in wide mirror, not the same with the inside life, but we can understand the powerfull personality of "" The Duke""."
5,Unbelieveably Good!,"I received Behnd the Wheel Arabic for Christmas. We live in a small university town and have a variety of 'ethnic' neighbors, among them Chinese and Arabic speaking.The native speaker's (Muhammad) voice is stunningly clear and his accent is easy to copy. The easy going learning style on the CDs and the rapid and dynamic 'sentence building' techniques are far beyond anything I have ever heard in other language courses, and I have heard quite a few.My neighbor Adiso is so confident in my newly acquired Arabic that he says that I can now go to the Middle East and get along fine with what I know after 5 or so weeks.I was so impressed with the speed with which I was able to speak complete sentences in Arabic after just a few days with Behind the Wheel Arabic, that I ran down to my local bookstore and bought Behind the Wheel Chinese as well.This course is an unbelieveably good bargain because it works where all else fails."
1,I would never buy a product like this without a booklet,"Thank you R. Morris. I almost bought this product assuming it had and accompanying booklet in at least transliteration, but preferably script and transliteration. A language product without either?! Ridiculous! Thank you for letting me know before I wasted my money!"
5,THE recording to get of these trios,"I heartily agree with the reviewer from Scotland/Hong Kong (although I would encourage him/her to give the other Lubin recordings a chance too)! The world-renowned Beaux Arts Trio has been one of my favorites for years and years, and their recording of these Mozart trios used to be my favorite. That was until I heard this recording by the Mozartean Players on period instruments -- it just strikes the perfect balance. It's tricky when playing Mozart not to get carried away by his sheer brilliance, but this recording shows so many more subtleties while still allowing that brilliance to show through."
5,Intriguing and Beautiful,"All three of my children, ages 2, 6, and 8, huddled around to hear this entire story! (How often does THAT happen?) The illustrations are simply beautiful, and in fact inspired my 6-year-old to experiment with more shades of color in his drawings, ""like an artist."" The story is intriguing, keeping my savvy 8-year-old interested to the end. We live in Paris now, so there was heightened interest to see familiar sights pictured in the story. Minou learns a valuable lesson. At the end of the story, however, I felt the message was somewhat forced. Still, I plan to give this book as Christmas gifts to all the cousins back in the U.S.A!"
5,what a power house,"Great tool, very powerful. I have owned a number of pressure washers,best by far. Do not turn your back on an inexperienced unaware operator. It will blow your house away!!!! Finally Honda has a low oil engine shut down switch. Great idea. But it is sensitive, oil needs to be at very top of its range and washer needs to be on level ground or it won't start."
5,twelve tips for anna karenina,"Susan Wilde wanted me to post the title poem. Here it is.--Robert Bixbydon't give up your kiddon't be mean to your ex-husbandget a dogjoin a gymmind your mannersbe glad you're getting a littlewhen you get a chance to be one of the people, take itremember him as a person, also strugglingbut remember yourself moreenjoy himbut enjoy yourself morepretty is as pretty doesstay back from the edgeget back on the horse"
4,Blue,These earrings are a beautiful shade of blue. I wear a lot of blue and they go with many different shades of blue.
1,Samsung is unreliable,"I own the previous model of this TV, and unless it has improved, don't buy it. Mine was out of warranty less than 5 months, and had 2 parts that needed replacing, for a total cost of 1500.00. I called Samsung and received only a rude response."
4,Can't imagine a better picture,"Just received this TV a few days ago and we are in love with it! I don't think you can get a better picture, and at this price it's simply a steal. Xbox 360 looks unbelievable on this set.For those concerned about the rainbow effect--yes, there is SOME rainbowing. However, I am the type of person who would notice this sort of thing and then obsess on how much it bothered me--yet I've seen it a few times (mostly during dark scenes in films) and it really isn't that big of a deal. I gave this TV 4 stars out of 5 due to the rainbows, and I certainly recommend checking the set out at a store if possible before you buy, but honestly the rainbowing is minor and not at all bothersome to me."
4,Great Picture but little else,"I bought a Samsung HL-R5067W The 50 inch has a beautiful color display but is slightly fuzzy being viewed form 9 feet in anything but the 4:3 mode.I am using a dishnet reciever. The TV has massive amounts of inputs and output jacks for almost everything you can imagine. But with all that engineering know how they neglected to put a earphone jack or a variable audio component output. I have a Samsung 27"" digital CRT tv which was their first digital tv and it had these two features. Samsung needs to reinvent their tv controller. They have never heard of a lighted keypad for nightime viewing or thought about getting away from layered menus. I rate the Picure a 4.5 but a 3 on the rest of the TV. Theres got to be something better"
5,Great TV,"I've had this tv for coming up on a month now. I did tons of research before buying and then tons of research on amazon because I had never bought anything online before. All in all, I am so glad I bought through amazon. I got a very good price which allowed me to purchase other things to go with the tv. It has the brightest picture you could imagine and everybody at my superbowl party loved it. I have referred many people to amazon since they have seen my tv. I even had some fireman that came to check a situation in my building stay and ask many questions about this tv, and couldnt believe that such a good picture could be had without having a plasma.Amazon's shipping was great as well. I also had this tv delivered on a saturday morning only 3 days after purchase, which wasn't expected. I am now a loyal user of this online retailer and will continue to steer people to this site."
5,Great TV,"Images are very clear when watching hd, easy to setup and light weight.Only down side is when there is a lot of movement, such as in action movies, the images become jagged, which is a problem with DLP technology."
1,Read the fine print before ordering TVs from Amazon,"Be aware of Amazon's return policy before you order a large TV.I purchased the Samsung DLP 50"" TV from Amazon and was delivereda broken piece of equipment. After talking to customer supportI found that they have a ""no return"" policy on large TVs and that I was liable for having the TV fixed. WHAT??? The customer is responsible for ensuring they receive the item in working condition!! This is absurd. Only an online store can hide likethis behind a customer service rep and deny all responsibility. They lost a LOT of future business because of a single transaction. Corporate irresponsibility at its best."
3,"Samsung HL-R5067W 50"" HD-Ready DLP TV","I am dissapointed in the picture quality. It looked much better in the store, perhaps they employed a higher resolution digital signal, I am hooked-up to standard cable TV. Sound quality lacks base and separation, plan on spending additional $ on external speakers. Build quality, fit and finish is very good. The TV guide feature is akward to set-up. I wish now that I spent the extra grand for plasma...."
2,Exceptional service,Delivery was excellent. Prompt and reliable. I will recommed and buy again from Amazon
3,Still waiting for $200 Amazon certificate promotion,"I'm still waiting for my $200 Amazon gift certificate (which was due last week). They said they had technical problems and it will take another 2 weeks to send me the gift certificate. In the meantime, this TV already went down in price by more than $200 after only one month. I'm hoping that if I can get the $200 gift certificate, I'll still break even for the rapid depreciation."
4,A good buy,This was a good buy. We are enjoying the new tv. Amazon had a tremendous deal. They are cheaper by about $300 minimum when I was researching this tv.
5,Great TV,This TV is great. I was concerned about the brightness becauase I have it in a very sunny room. But even when the sun is shining right into the room the tv is very visible. It is also nice for watching in standard 4:3 mode if you are like me and do not like when tv images are distorted. The delivery service was also very good. The guys showed up right on time and had the tv set up and on within 10 minutes. I could not be happier with my purchase
4,Great HD Picture,"Great TV for HD signal. The Cablecard does not really work with the TV very well. Also do not love the features supplied with the TV remote.Update - This TV broke 4 times and I had the extended warrenty which help, but I would lower my stars from 4 to 3 if I could."
4,Excellent picture,"Great performance! Sharp image and vivid color reproduction.However, the universal remote is limited to only a hand full of devices that it will control. It doesn't support my Magnavox DVD player/recorder and my new Motorola HDTV cable box from Comcast.Other than that, I would recommend this TV for everyone who's in the market for a HD big screen."
1,I was part of the bust,"These people have no clue what they are talking about. The book is is an obvious attempt to cash in on the glee some people have of seeing the tech bubble burst, because they were not part of it. Most of us have moved on. Most have moved on to other high tech jobs, but some to the law, medicine, politics, finance, and even back to tech again. Most of the people in the tech world are either very happy because they get to do the work they love, or they got out because they were here for a quick buck. The individuals these people see in their practice need help. The ones who thought that moving to the bay area would fix their life had problems to begin with. Duh."
5,"Excellent research and writing, this is THE Garbo biography.","Take it from someone who has a shelf full of books on Garbo, Karen Swenson's ""Greta Garbo, A Life Apart"" is easily the best of the bunch. Where other authors have simply repeated stories from book to book, Swenson uses a detective's eye to find the facts. The book is highly readable and manages to give you a glimpse of who the mysterious Greta Garbo really was."
5,Fascinating and believable...,"This wonderful story, about a wonderful woman, combines a selection of rare photos with startling new information about her childhood, her career, tumultuous relationships with lovers and friends, and her life after Hollywood."
1,Art book,I was quite dissapointed with my purchase. The seller could have stated in his discription that the book had water damage. Pages were stuck together. I would have bought from a different seller had I known about terrible condition of the book.
4,review,"I gave 4 stars only because I don't remember if there were any problems with the length of time between ordering and receiving, but the book was in perfect condition. Thanks."
5,The Essential Cocker Spaniel,The Essential Cocker Spaniel is a great handbook giving specifics about the beloved Cocker Spaniel. Prior to owning a cocker any potential ower MUST read this book cover to cover. It is wonderful for reference after acquiring this wonderful breed of dog.Photography in this book is fabulous. Winter and Churchill did their usual outstanding job.
1,not worth it,i bought this book really hoping to find some good monologs and was very disapointed. all of the monologs are unusable for most competitions because they are not from published plays. and the monologs really have no substance. it is also very difficult to build a character with no information.
4,Better than it's sequel!,"I gotThe Ultimate Audition Book for Teens: 111 One-Minute Monologues (Young Actors Series)recently.I have only read this book and the 2nd version, and I loved this one! It had lots of variety and ranged from serious, comedic, ironic, and makes-you-think monologues. I have not found one right for my next upcoming audition, but this book is brimming with interesting and memorable monologues, so I'm sure I will! Highly recommended for probably 15-18 year olds, but there is something in this book for everyone."
1,not appropriate for teens,flipped through the book when I received it. Glad I did before giving it to my 13 year old daughter. Stumbled upon the F*** word just by flipping pages. Threw the book in the trash.
2,Don't waste your money on these monologues,"It's hard to find really good monologues...and this book definitely will not help you. There are only two or three in the whole book that I actually liked...and even then, they're not necessarily good pieces for auditions. I wouldn't recommend this book; if you want one of the few enjoyable monologues, go make a copy of them at your library or something. But remember, if you're searching for the perfect monologue, you probably won't find it here.KelliFuture Star"
2,Not appropriate,This book contains a ton of monologues that are NOT appropriate for teens! The material is very adult oriented (scenes containing sexual content and/or language) and I was only able to find a few I was comfortable using in my class. Not worth it.
2,Beware of quality issues,"We ordered this toy from Drugstore.com, which showed a picture of an older model, not the new ""upgraded"" toy. The idea of this toy is intriguing but the actual execution of the idea is less than stellar. The ""music"" is tinny and unattractive. Apparently, the older model had better sound quality, which is why I went with this vendor. However, communicating with Drugstore.com and the whole return process is a significant hassle. The also blamed the deceptive picture they used on a glitch with the manufacturer. I would actually recommend either getting a used model with all purple corners (the older model) or buying it at a brick and mortar location so you can actually listen to it. If you are going to purchase on Amazon, consider another vendor. Very disappointed. I will not do business with this vendor again."
1,OUT OF TUNE!,"This toy is so out of tune. I changed the batteries hoping that would solve it, but no. It's really bad."
5,Great toy for handicapped kids.,"I bought this toy for my son who has multiple handicaps - he's blind and has cerebral palsy. He loves music. This toy sits easily on his lap and the push squares are large and easy to access. He loves it. It's hit the ground a few times and is still in one piece. I would recommend this toy highly to anyone buying for a child with fine motor disabilities. The shape, size and weight are perfect to encourage my son to work with his hands and arms. It can't help but improve fine and gross motor skills. If there are any therapists out there reading this, they might want to take a look."
4,Toy Enthusiast,"I gave this toy to my 11 month old son and he was instantly drawn to it. Much to Our surprise, the music does not sound like a computer. The sounds are vibrant and are bursting with energy. I like that my son can manipulate which instruments are playing.I highly recommend this toy!"
4,"Nice toy, a little pricy","I bought this for my 3-year old daughter as one of her Christmas present from Santa Claus, she is not that into it, I think this is best for kids age 6 months to 2 years. I was going to buy it on Amazon, happened to find it elsewhere for just a little over $20."
3,no volume control,"I'm a musician, and when I received this as a gift for my son, I was quite enthused. He is 2.5 and still loves it, and so does my 7 month old daughter. However, it is really loud, especially when the entire orchestra plays, and I worry a little about it damaging the kids' ears because they like to play with it so much. Also, I wish it played recordings of actual instruments instead of a synthesized version. But overally it's a pretty good toy."
4,Entertaining toy!,"I received this cube for my baby shower and didn't really introduce it to my baby until she was about 2.5/3 months old. Now at 4 months, she loves to watch the lights and she even hits the buttons to turn it on--although it's done by accident! This is certainly a great toy and I would recommend it but the only unfortunate part is that the songs only play for about 30 seconds and you have to hit the button again to start it. I wish there was a feature to turn it on for about 10 minutes to keep their attention. So I have to keep hitting the buttons every time or she will get bored. But overall, she loves the different songs, loves the lights and you don't have to worry about it breaking, it's soft yet durable around every corner!"
5,Great toy,I have bought the Mozart Magic Cube for three different families (sister and two friends). All the children loved the toy and the toy is very durable. The only negative comment I heard is the toy is loud and there is no way to adjust the volume. I am going to buying the toy again for another friend when his son turns one.
4,Toy seems good -- but same problem as others with packaging!,We received this toy as a gift for our baby. Haven't used it yet but we had the same trouble with the packaging as everyone else! Pliers work.
3,Cute,I thought this toy was really cute and it was definitely a hit with the child that I gave it too. However I bought two of the products and was extremely disappointed that only one actually worked properly. Before you send something the people should make sure the product is actually working properly.
5,Great music! Educational,"Loved the product, bright colors, my son loves the music and I love that it shows pictures and words of each sound.... overall great product, and I love that he can bang his little hands on it!!!"
2,Broken...,"Worked great for about a month, then it broke and no longer plays music. Not for toddlers who like to throw things."
4,Munchkin Magic Mozart Cube,"My 16 month old grandson loves this toy. He will play the music for hours, even when he's playing with something else. The music is slightly tinny and I wish they had a volume adjustment - otherwise a great toy."
5,Love It!,"We love this toy. I bought it for my 5th month old for christmas, and now he's 9 months and he still loves it. The best part is... it's not annoying at all! Score for mom :-). It lights up and has a rubbery grip to it so i don't haver to worry about him bitting the sides of it when his teeth are bothering him. Very happy we bought this item."
2,We must have gotten a lemon,I gave my new granddaughter this toy for Christmas. It seemed like a great product but turned out to be playing off key. My daughter-in-law gave it back to me. Who wants to give the kid a tin ear for life. I will return it if possible.
1,Great while it lasted....,"My son really enjoyed the Mozart cube, but it didn't last very long. It stopped working after less than 2 weeks of use. I changed the batteries, but it still didn't work. It is just too pricey for the amount of time that it lasted."
5,music cube,This is just adorable and perfect for my music major daugters child. Also very durable. We all enjoy the variety of music and instuments.
2,"Great Concept, Poor Execution","We bought the Mozart Magic Cube for our daughter's first birthday. In concept, this toy is a great idea. However, both the sound quality and durability of the Cube is very poor. The sound is very tinny and sounds like it was produced by a cheap synthesizer rather than an orchestral instrument. Often when the toy is dropped during play (as a child is likely to do), the cube stops playing and won't restart until it's turned off and then on again. Sometimes the only way to get it to work again is to remove and reinstall the batteries. Save yourself some money and frustration and don't buy this toy!"
1,So loud it went straight in the attic,"This toy turned out to be so noisy that I never gave it to my child. It went straight in the attic. Frankly I was concerned it could damage my 10 month old daughter's hearing.It says that it is for children of all ages, well certainly not for babies and toddlers who have their toys up close (even licking them) all the time. Perhaps when she is 3-4 years old, but certainly not now.Why on earth did the manufacturer not put a simple little button on it to control the volume? I think this could have been a great toy, but as it is now it's useless."
3,musical construction,"This was given to my two year old nephew as a birthday gift. At first it would not work. After determining it was not the batteries a little detective work found that the battery casing was not made correctly. If it was screwed in to tight it would not work. So this musical cube now works and itself is a great item, the music and intruments heard. But if you touch the battery compartment it stops working and how do you tell a two year old not to handle the cube. A+ for the item and c- for the toys construction."
3,"5 month old loves it; unfortunately, the color comes off!!!","I bought this as a gift for my best friend's 5 month old baby. She tells me the baby loves it and it's the only toy the baby laughs at when he plays! One problem: my friend noticed that the color of the cube comes off! Not good for the baby! So now they only allow the baby to kick the toy and look/listen to the toy from a distance! I'm not sure if the one I got was a defective one, but parents out there should be aware of this problem as baby's will always put toys in their mouth."
4,very good toy for many ages,"This is a wonderful toy - it is entertaining to so many kids, not just babies. I cannot give it five stars though because there is no volume control. I find it too loud."
2,Stopped working after 1 year,"Okay, my daughter really liked playing with this music cube. I don't think there is much educational value for a 1 year old, but she loved pushing on the buttons to make it play. Problem is that after the batteries died, I replaced the batteries and the cube no longer worked. So I give it 2 stars for the poor quality of the electronics."
2,They weren't impressed,"I worked in the church nursery for over 4 years with this toy in one of the toyboxes available to the children. I never saw any of them properly engage with it. They'd pull it out, bang it a couple of times (starting up 2 different sounds) and then get bored and crawl away. It was the one toy I knew I'd never buy for my children."
2,Disappointed,"I was so excited to get this for my 1yo, and it is a great toy... My 1yo & 3yo love it. BUT it has an issue with batteries! When it arrived (with included batteries in a ""try me"" box), the batteries were dead. It's not being played with at a rate that warrants having to change the batteries once or twice a week. When it begins getting low on power, the music sounds warped, like an old warped record, which is dreadful! Perhaps we got a defective one. I don't know. I hope this isn't happening to others."
5,Best investment in a toy,This toy was a gift for my daughter when she was a baby...she's now almost nine and the toy has been used by my three other children as well. My husband and I frequently comment this is the best toy we've ever had. It is nearly nine years old and still works the same as it was brand new! The kids love playing with it! It's great for babies all the way up to 5 year olds. We highly recommend this toy. It is a great investment!
4,"Music sounds ""electronic"" as I expected.","I like the features listed. The instruments have an ""electronic"" sound, but are close enough to tell which is which. The Mozart selections are familiar tunes. Be sure to have a precision size Phillips screwdriver to change the batteries."
3,"Music nice, but not durable","This is an interesting toy where the child can add or subtract instruments from a piece of classical music by pushing buttons on the sides of the cube. My kids probably didn't understand that they were changing the instruments, but they did like it. However, my toddler sometimes throws toys and this one broke with one good throw. And yes, he threw it, but I think a toy aimed at babies and toddlers should be able to handle at least some dropping and throwing."
4,Lovely toy,"We received this as a gift for my first child, but I just rediscovered how nice it is with my second. My 2 year old loves to play with this with her baby brother. The corners are a softer (maybe silicon) material so that if my 5 month old bumps it as he's trying to grab it doesn't bother him. He can push the buttons easily and my daughter loves to help him add the instruments. He loves how it lights up and I love the nice tune vs. other noisy baby toys. My only complaint is that it was not immediately obvious where the batteries go once they die (and they do die rather quickly during frequent play in my opinion), but keep an eye on the little screw to figure it out!"
5,Favorite toy!,"This is one of my son's favorite toys. He's been watching/listening to it since he was born. Now that he's 5 months old, he's still very interested in it. Currently likes to kick the buttons with his feet and loves the music (as do I). This is a toy that will provide entertainment for months to come!"
2,Never Played With,"This was a Christmas present for my 9 month old. 8 months later it stays tucked in the toybox never to be played with. Maybe this would be better for a really young baby? He plays with it for about 5 seconds then gets bored. My 3 year old was never interested in it. The music is pleasant, and it is durable."
3,Hard to Hold,"The buttons are not easily pushed to play a sound. It's a good thing that the corners are rubber bumpers because the cube is not an easy item to hold. The music is great, but interest is lost with the difficulty in pushing the buttons."
1,The worst toy ever!,Most loud toys don't bother me... this one is the WORST toy ever. It's so loud (no volume switch-- at least on my model) and it doesn't stop. It ended up getting put away for good.
4,Interesting and fun,"This product is interesting and fun for my 7 months old twins. I'm sure they will grow to understand it and love it even further in the future.The only drawback I see is that the quality of sound is not great, and the instruments sound more like simulated electronic sound than the real sound of the instrument."
5,GREAT TOY,"My brother has this for their baby, but I have found that I play with it quite a bit too. If she is out of the room and I pick it up to play it, she will come from wherever in the house and stand in front of me doing a little dance. I'm not sure if I like that more than the actual cube itself or not, but this thing is really good fun!"
1,Mom of active boy,our son loves anything that plays music and when we heard about this toy we went out and bought it. He was 15 months old then and didn't seem to like it. He pushed the buttons afew times but mainly it just sat. I bring it out every couple of weeks to show him how neat it is and it still does nothing for him. He is now 21 months old. He loves the leap frog drum and the phonics radio. ANd they were only 19.99 each not 34.99.I wouldn't spend your money on this.
1,Do NOT Buy,"I second the other reviewers who warn that this is a cheaped out version of the original Embryonics toy. I got this toy and while it is a great idea, the sound is so bad and OUT OF TUNE that I just couldn't let my kids play with it. After reading the reviews saying that the old Embryonics version was better, I got one on ebay and in fact it was. Shame on Munchkin for taking a great toy, ruining it, and then riding on the coattails of the original toy. What's more, when I called the company, they just told me to send it back at my own expense and denied that they had changed the innards of the toy. But I played it and the original one right after the other and the difference is obvious, and huge. Scary when a company that makes items for babies lies to you. I would have given zero stars if I could. I will never buy a Munchkin product again. Trust is everything in the baby business."
2,Just not interested,"Our three year old got this as a gift when she was a year old and never really liked it. We thought it was because she never liked electronic toys, much preferring to play with music toys in which she made the music (like the Little Tikes instruments.) Our one year old had always loved musical electronic toys, but she doesn't like it either.Oddly enough, when we tried to change the batteries (the first time after about 2 1/2 years) the battery compartment broke and we had to throw it out anyway."
2,pretty pretty pretty good,"The product is very fun for my daughter of 12 months, but the sound is so electronic that all of the selective instruments sound kind of the same. How hard would it have been to have actual recordings of instruments? I guess they don't have actual instruments in China."
5,Baby's favourite toy...,"We got this as a gift from a friend and have had it by the diaper changing table and would play the music while changing diapers from when she was a few weeks old. As she got bigger (she would roll over to grab the box while diaper changing which was not much of help!!!) and more mobile the cube came over to her usual play area and after 6 months she still enjoys it every one bit!! It has saved us from her non-stop crying every single time!! We don't go anywhere long distance without it - far more effective than a pacifier! ;)Of course, I don't take Mozart as seriously anymore! But that's another issue altogether."
5,My Son's Favorite Toy,"This is my son's favorite toy, and it has been for quite some time. It's educational, and he never gets tired of it. A great choice for all babies."
3,Too heavy!,"My 13mo loves the music, but gets very frustrated that she can't easily lift it. When we first got it (about 11mo), she couldn't lift it at all. Now, she can, but only with both hands and it's awkward for her to walk with it, which she wants to do. It would be much better designed in a hand-held size."
2,"If there was a Volume switch, it would be perfect......","My children (an infant and a preschooler) like this toy--but it is WAY too loud. I wish there was a way to turn the volume down. I'd return this if I purchased it at a store, but it's too much of a hassle to return this to amazon. So sad."
5,13 month old loves it!!!,My daughter loves this toy. She'll sit with her books and press the on the box for the pleasant tunes. My husband and I really enjoy the music. It's ten times better than the average music played by other baby toys.
2,So loud!,"I bought this toy on the recommendation of a blog. I wish I had read some of the bad reviews first. First off- my baby does like this toy a lot and it is the perfect height for him to lean on while learning how to sit. The problem is the non-adjustable volume. Considering this is a toy for a baby who has tiny sensitive ears, the volume is way too loud. It's too loud for an adult product. I can hear it well from a different floor in the house. My son can ruin his hearing on his own when he's a teenager- I'm not going to do it for him with this toy."
5,Baby loves it!,"My 15-month-old loves this music box. It's durable, too, which means Mom loves it too."
4,"Great Toy, Poor Customer Service","This is a great toy. My 14 month old son picked one up in a store not too long ago and it kept his attention for quite some time. I purchased this one for a friend whose son is 5 months old. She said he loved it and plays with it frequently and for long periods of time. My only complaint is the seller. This was a gift and it arrived without gift wrap, which I asked for and also there was no message included. My friend had no idea who it was from until I asked if she had received it."
4,Great for little music lovers!,If your child loves music and dancing then they will love this toy. My baby loves it. She is almost a year now and has enjoyed it since she was just a few months old. The only complaint I have is that it doesn't have a volume switch. When they are younger it seems a little too loud.
5,My 1-year old and 4-year old LOVE this toy!,"My husband and I gave this toy to our son for his 1st birthday. What a GREAT toy. He loves it, and so does his 4-year old brother. They play with it every day, many times a day. The music is a nice change from the usual nursery rhymes, and we haven't grown tired of listening to it. A really terrific toy!!!"
2,Boring toy,"My daughter got this for Christmas when she was about 6 mos old. She rarely ever plays with it. She was slightly amused with this toy for a month or two. She never plays with it now. When she did show interest in it, it only lasted a few moments. The music does get a little annoying because my daughter liked it when all instruments would play at the same time. Nothing special about this toy and it's loud. Would not recommend."
4,good quality and tough,"Got this as a gift when baby was 5 months. He liked mouthing the somewhat soft corners and I played it for him. He now plays it himself (13 months). I do not think he gets he can turn off and on each instrument but I suppose that will come. The quality of music is very good, not mechanically computerized like some toys. It has five or so songs and you can turn off and on each instrument. That is pretty neat. Baby likes it. The only problem is that there is no volume control. Batteries last a pretty long time in it. The songs are nice too, jazzy and complex enough to be interesting. It seems really tough. It has withstood some hard knocks. It has a very solid feel, which worried me at first because I was afraid baby would hurt himself face-planting into it, but no injuries. The corners are rounded and slightly rubbery. It's kind of heavy so just now has baby really been able to haul it around."
3,Great toy... for the hearing impaired,"We got our twin boys this Mozart Magic Cube for Christmas, when they were 6 months old. We liked everything about it...except that it was TOO LOUD! I've actually been amazed at the number of baby toys that are annoyingly loud. Some to the point that they made our babies cry (like this one). I've actually had to place duct tape over speaker holes on numerous things such as mobiles, play gyms, and an activity table because otherwise those products are great, just loud. But therein lies the problem with this toy - there is no obvious speaker hole on it. It's as if the annoyingly loud music emanates from every crevice. Which is why it has been put away since Christmas. Now that the boys are 9.5 months I may try to bring it out again and see if they will tolerate it. If not I'll just sell this overpriced piece of plastic at my MOMs Resale next month."
3,Mozart cube,"The product is durable which is good since my toddler drops it a lot. It hasn't held her interest like some of her other toys like Leapfrogs My Pal Violet. It's ok, but it wasn't as good as we hoped."
5,sweet music to your baby's ears,"We just got this cube as a birthday gift to our 1 y.o. girl and she loves it. You can add and subtract instruments and enjoy the music. She loves playing with it, the colors are beautiful and the toy is well-built. Oh, and it has a good volume: not too loud, very easy on the ears."
5,Keeps my daughter entertained,"My daughter received this for her first birthday. She absolutely loves it. She's 16 months old now, and it has become her favorite toy. She will climb into her toy box, over all her other stuff, to get to it. It keeps her busy for a good 20 minutes at a time while she experiments with all the different songs and musical instrument sounds. We still haven't had to replace the batteries, which is a definite plus!"
1,Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Have purchased this product a few years back and gave it as gifts to many babies. Now, however it is made by a different manufacturer than the original one and the sound is horrible, especially considering the price is not cheap. I noticed other reviewers felt the same way. The sound quality was so bad (and I am not a music geek so my standards were not unreasonable) that I could not give it as a gift without extreme embarrassment. None of the instruments sounded clear, but rather very tinny and CHEAP! What a shame. This used to be a fantastic product. I'll never purchase again."
2,"Loved by our twins, but easily broken!","I wish I could give this cube 5 stars! If it were based on how much our twins adored the toy, I would definitely give it a better rating! However, I feel the need to mention that we initially purchased this toy for our 6+ mos old twins and within a few months the battery cover cracked right next to the on/off switch, leaving the batteries easily accessible. Duct tape would not even keep the cover on securely, because the cover was under so much pressure from the batteries and springs underneath.When our twins were 1 1/2 we decided to put it on the Christmas wish list, because they both adored the first one so much. Much to our dismay, the exact same thing happened to the battery cover of the second one!What a huge disappointment! Obviously this toy has a manufacturing defect and I can only hope that Munchkin fixes it for future production of the toy. The concept is excellent and our twins really did love it, especially our very musical little girl."
4,Great little toy,"We received this as a gift for my almost 16 month old daughter this Christmas. She loves it! She will dance to it and pretend to conduct. I give 4 stars because it doesn't hold her attention for that long, but we play with it all the time between other things. It sounds pleasant, too. Our friends with a 10 month old came over, and their child seemed really drawn to it, and liked it a lot, too. Definitely worth getting - it gets more play than most of our toys."
4,Love the classical music,"Am thrilled to have my granddaughter hearing classical music. I haven't seen her playing with this yet, but she loves sound and her parents said this was a hit."
3,"Twins love it, but it broke after a couple weeks!","It's hard for me to rate this product, because my girls, who were 8 months old when we bought the Magic Cube, loved pressing the buttons and hearing the music. However, after just a few weeks, the cube cracked. With the crack came sharp edges. My girls were only 8 months old; they weren't strong enough to even lift the cube, so my husband and I aren't sure how it broke in the first place. Unfortunately, we're going to have to throw it away :("
5,Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,I bought this for our grandson for his 1st birthday. He loves music and he loves his magic cube. It is easy for him to push and he figured out that each side makes a different sound really quick. It is very sturdy and the music quality is good for a toy. I would recommend it.
1,UNHAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE,"We ordered this as it sounded like a wonderful toy. My mother comes from Vienna and I thought it would be wonderful for my twin 1-year-old grandsons to learn Mozart. However, this thing has blown over 10 batteries since the time it was purchased a few months ago, and Amazon is going to do nothing about it."
1,Too Loud!,"Great toy in theory, but way too loud! I bought it and as soon as I realized that there's no way to control the sound I decided to return it. Would be a great toy if added volume control to it!"
2,Not for my son,It's neat but my 18 month old son doesn't like it much. He actually sometimes complains about it and wants me to just turn it off.
5,Christmas Magic,"Gave this to my 1-year old granddaughter for Christmas and her mother finally had to give her a ""time out"" from it. Not that it was annoying -- on the contrary. It proved to be a favorite! Lots of great tunes, instruments and fun, fun, fun."
1,HORRIBLY OUT OF KEY!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I had high expectations of this toy given the reviews here. Much to my disappointment, many of the instruments are notably out of tune, making it exquisitely unpleasant for anyone who has even a remotely musical ear. It is certainly not good for babies to be repeatedly bombarded with horribly off-pitch music. It is like nails on a chalkboard. Great idea - bad execution. Skip this one."
1,Not for the young,"We bought this for our 4 month old daughter because she enjoys music; we then tried to pass it on to our 1 year old niece but she wasn't impressed either. The recommended age group is 0-6 years old and that's too big of a gap. The parents enjoyed it more than the kids. I would think that it should be for an older child, say 3 or 4 years old."
1,nice while it lasted,"This toy stopped working as our child was starting to enjoy it. It just stopped! We tried new batteries, everything. Very disappointing."
3,"Overpriced, Loud, and Boring","I had high hopes for this item based on other reviews, but it was a huge letdown. It plays one tune with different instruments, and it is too loud for a baby. With a music background, I really want to expose my son to beautiful, classical music. This is not the item to do that with. I will keep looking for other musical toys with more variety and sophistication.Update: This is still my least favorite toy, mainly due to the volume. I wish I could turn it down. Thanks to a helpful comment, I did manage to play all the tunes and felt fairly silly not reading the directions beforehand. I sill stick with my original rating, though. There are just so many better toys out there."
3,Possibly dangerous for under 1 year,"Initially, I thought this was a great toy. My 5 month old didn't seem to love it, but would sort of press the buttons and screw around with it. Unfortunately, at 6 months, she can now sit up, but has little control over her body. Today, she flailed herself towards the cube and banged her eye socket against one of the corners. She has no injury to her actual eye, but she has a bruise below her eye now, and has been crying all night.I am done with hard plastic. I think I am switching to all soft toys and cubes until she is 1."
1,Never Received,"Cannot review, product was never received. Postal department was to contact you with forms."
1,Balanced Review,"Well, we received the Cube in a battered box and found that the device functioned marginally. The carrier may have dropped a piano on it or something. It appears to be an adequate toy but far too expensive. The sound / instrument quality is actually quite good. The build, design and aesthetics are so so, but again, the expense is unjustifiable. We will be returning ours because of its condition (one button remains constantly depressed and no sound comes from it unless rattled vigorously). The damaged goods status gives us a good reason to return this sub par, high cost toy. There are alternatives out there for a better return on your toy budgetary investments."
1,disappointed mom,"i bought this toy for my two handicapped sons who love music(unfortunately not from amazon)while on a trip to the states . when we got home and tried it the toy didn't work at all, we have never even gotten one sound out of it. we emailed embryonics several times and they never replied, so naturally neither we nor my sons are impressed by this toy"
4,"Fun toy, bad music","My son absolutely loves this toy, and that's the only reason I put up with it. It plays out of sync AND out of tune. Even my husband, who can't hold a tune himself, notices how badly out of tune it is. GREAT idea, poor execution."
4,Poorly implemented,"I wish I'd found one of these in the store with working batteries. I love the concept, but it is not well implemented. The sound quality is not good. It reminds me of the Casio keyboards from when I was a kid. The instruments do not sound like real instruments, and they are not tuned together. The volume is too loud for a child who is holding the toy. Until she was about 7 months old, she cried whenever this was turned on. Now at 8 months she has discovered it on her own and it is one of her favorite toys."
5,cute musical cube,"my daughter's gamndmother bought this for her becuase she htought it would soothe her at night. turns out it just gets her riled up to play so we moved it out of he room and into the living room and she plays with it all the time! she absolutely love pressign the buttons, seeing them light up, and hearing the music that comes from pressing the buttons!"
1,Packaging from Hell,There are a number of stiff plastic wires connecting the toy to its packaging that are extremely difficult to remove. I'd recommend against buying this for that reason alone. Not suitable for use by a child until they've been carefully pried out.
2,Hold Your Ears,"This toy while interesting in its approach to presenting the sound of various instruments, is annoyingly loud. Unfortunately there is no volume control, so you either listen to it at full volume or not at all. Sorry I bought it. Also the size of the cube it rather large for a young child."
3,Too Loud,"I thought the idea behind this toy was great. I love all the different musical instruments and how you can put them together or listen to them seperatly. However, I do have one major complaint for this item. It is increadibly loud! I know that a lot of baby toys on the market can tend to be a little loud and annoying at times but this one has outdone them all. I tried putting the blue painters tape all over the holes where the sound comes out to tone it down a bit as I have with many of our other toys with speakers but this didn't do much to bring it down to an acceptable noise level. I hope that the manufacturers will come out with a new version of this toy in the future that isn't so loud as I think it is a great concept."
1,Super loud,"Got this as a gift and love the idea but it is poorly executed. It is super loud, there is no volume control and it is glitchy."
2,ehh. . .,Purchased this because my 16 month old son loves music and this product has amazing reviews. Gave it to my son for Christmas and he is completely uninterested in it. . . I am disappointed
5,Not built to last,"We're on our second one -- the first didn't work out of the box (which would have been a letdown for a child older than our toddler son). The replacement worked fine and has generally been a source of delight for our family (dad loves playing it, too!). For mom and dad, though, this toy has become a disappointment. The manufacturer has tried really hard to make this a tough toy and we salute them for that. But after little more than a year, one button has died and the toy has a tendency to decide it ""doesn't feel like playing today"" even with brand-new batteries. Yes, toys wear out. But for the steep price, we expected much more. In short: A great musical / educational toy, but not built to last. Not a great value."
2,Wow - so does not deserve 5 stars!,"I don't usually review items on Amazon - mostly because I agree with the star system that is in place. This item had quite a discrepancy between the stars received and how few I would give it.As many people have mentioned, you really need to be tone deaf to enjoy this cube. I thought the others complaining about the off-tune music were just music snobs that had a fun time at ""band camp"" - but this isn't true! I'm about as forgiving as possible when it comes to kids toys (and didn't go to ""band camp""), but I found myself replacing the batteries trying to make it sound better.There is some kind of tone shift mid-note that I would only expect from a product that is out power. Do yourself a favor and find something else. I give it two stars mostly because as a cube it keeps my 11 month old occupied for a few minutes a day without breaking into small choke-hazard pieces. That's where the praise stops."
5,Eli loves it!,"My just turned year old grandson, Eli, received this from us for his birthday and immediately started playing with it. It's one of his favorite toys! I highly recommend its play value."
4,Fabulous toy,My 6 month old is captivated by this toy. He loves to hear the music and it's easy enough for him to press the various sides. The music and the lights hold his attention. This actually belonged to his now 5 year old sister and it's held up well in the five years we've owned. I highly recommend it.
1,WHat is wrong with the quality??,"I bought this cube for my 14 month old daughter and was really excited for her to play with, as she loves music. This cube stopped working withing a week! and did not work even after i changed the battery. Oh, it gets better..the return for this product is just 5 days from the day it ships! I think the company knows the crappy product it is manufacturing and wants to cover all its bases. Really a shame..as the product is really nice...the quality and the return policy must be improved. It is putting me of against all the munchkins products."
3,neat toy,"Directions do not clearly indicate how this toy works like how to change tunes, and there is no volume control. Plastic ties that hold this toy in it's packaging go into the toy and you can only cut one end off and the plastic sticks out sharply from the music box and you can't get the box open to get them out. Kind of worriesome. Neat little toy, but I don't see much interest in it by anyone but me."
5,The best toy ever,"This toy is amazing for all children. I have given this music box to each of my grandchildren and they have all been overjoyed. I recommend this toy highly. It is fun, educational, musical and it is truly the gift that just keeps ""playing."""
2,"Broke after a year, Didn't Get Baby's Attention Much Before That","It had a lovely sound and I enjoyed it, but usually the baby didn't have much interest. And despite its low level of use, it stopped working entirely before it was a year old."
5,Pleasant and long-lasting entertainment,"My daughter got this as a gift at 8 months and loved hearing the music and watching the squares light up. Now at 18 months, she still loves this toy and will frequently dance to the music and start the music herself. I think in another year, she'll still love it, once she understands how she can create her own music by adding and subtracting instruments. This is a toy that grows with the child, which is so rare. It is literally the only toy she got last Chanukah that she's still playing with today. Plus, I love playing with it myself...can't beat that!"
5,Mozart Magic Cube,"This is an excellent toy for young children. My son received one at birth six years ago and loved it. We since have bought one for our one year old daughter and a friend. By the way, our son still loves playing with his cube!"
5,Brilliant toy,"Our son received this cube as a gift when he was 8 months old, and instantly loved it. He is now 13 months old and still loves this cube. The instruments sound crisp and clear, and the symphony feature is amazing. Every Mom who has been at our house loves this toy. I highly recommend the Mozart Cube for its entertainment value and for its introduction of different classical music instruments. Brilliant idea, Munchkin!"
1,Poorest quality sound I've ever heard,Length:: 2:32 MinsWe purchased this item both for our daughter and as a gift. The construction is rock hard plastic and a sound quality that would embarrass a monkey with a hurdy-gurdy. Please listen to the sound 'quality' before you decide to buy.
5,Third child - one change of batteries!,"We bought the cube (or received it as a gift?) for my daughter when she was an infant. She's now six. She played with the cube over and over again - loved the lights and music. Our now 4-year old daughter loved it too. She even played with it occaisonally when she was 3 since she's now piecing together instruments etc. Our 6-month old baby is now enthralled with the cube. SHe can sit up and thinks it totally amazing. This toy has been dropped, rolled, chewed etc with no signs of wear. I never worry that the baby will hurt herself if she falls on it - rounded and rubbery edges are safe. We've changed the batteries ONCE in almost 6 years. Great toy!"
2,Disappointed,"Although our special needs grandchild can hit the squares to produce music and puts his ear to the cube, the sounds are poor. We thought the batteries were weak but replacements did not change the sound. Sorry we did not return it."
2,Wouldn't consider it a top toy,"I often see the music cube listed as a top toy for a 1 year old so it was on my child's birthday list. It's too loud, no volume control and we have other musical toys that I would consider better quality and better value for your money."
5,RAVE REVIEW!,"The fabulous Munhkin Mozart Magic Cube was given to our friend's daughter when she was an infant. From a very early age, we watched in amazement as she responded to the sounds of the music, obviously recognizing changes. We could see the pleasure on her face. As time went on, she played with the toy herself and was constantly drawn to it.There was always a limited assortment of toys for her to explore on the living room floor. She loved to play with some more than others. However, she was always constantly drawn back to this -- the sounds of the music from different instruments was a great source of fascination.As she gets older, the way that she handles Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube becomes more selective and sophisticated. This is one of the best toys we have ever seen to develop delight in music!She is beginning to talk now, and I feel certain that her first words will be, ""GET ME A HARPSICHORD NOW!!""Love it!"
5,Wonderful!!!,"I loved this music cube! I bought it for my 1 year old neice, but my 3 1/2 year old son didn't want to let it go. It keeps both their attention very well. The buttons are easy enough for the 1 year old to push and the program of how each instrument can add to the whole piece is an interesting element for my 3 1/2 year old. Great gift item!"
3,"Sounds artificial, the sound quality could be better","This is a great idea, and the toy is built well and is colorful and fun to look at. And some of the instruments sounds good (the flute & the french horn). But the violin sound is incredibly fake and unrealistic, so it's not a good way to introduce baby to the sound of a real violin at all. And when you play the Orchestra mode, so all the instruments play at the same time, I often have to turn off the violin sound just so it's not so unpleasant to listen to. The volume is not a problem for me at all, I know others complained it was too loud but I think the volume was good (you're not using this toy at bedtime, it's a daytime active playtime toy). But they could have, and should have, done a better job of having accurate sounds for the instruments, especially for a toy marketed as introducing your baby to the various classical instruments."
2,"Great music, but it doesn't hold my son's interest.","I seem to be more interested in this toy than my 8 month old. There are lots of beautiful songs and the music is very high quality for an electronic toy. It's too bad my son doesn't like to play with it, because the music is so much nicer to listen to than any of his other toys!"
2,Music doesn't synch,"I was disappointed in this toy. When playing two or more of the instruments, the music was usually out of synchronization. Plus, it was too difficult to select the song you wanted to hear. Great idea, bad execution."
1,Fun? Depends on who you ask. . . .,"Buyer beware! My 16-month-old received this toy as a gift from my mother-in-law and of course loved it - the one time my husband and I let him play with it. What parent needs to lose his or her sanity over a toy? ...Whereas some musical toys have volume control or only play for few seconds, the Mozart Magic Cube blares at one solitary volume level and plays the ENTIRE sonata before it shuts off. It's like the Energizer Bunny: it keeps going and going and going and . . . .... . . . Heed my warning...buy a board book about musical instruments and a Baby Mozart tape instead."
5,long-lasting fun,"I bought this for my son when he was 7 months old. At first my nanny would push the buttons for him, and he would stare transfixed at the toy for a long time, sometimes lulled to sleep eventually. As he grew older he figured out how to push it to change tunes. He still enjoys it now that he is 13 months old. The tunes grew on us, too. It is not ""noisy"" like other musical toys. I think the way you can add or take away instruments is very good for developing children's musical ear. However, I have to say one thing bad about it. The toy is just slightly out of tune. That bothers me because I would like children to hear music in tune. I disagree with some of the reviewers who wrote that the toy was not very durable. For us it has held up quite well after being thrown numerous times (knock on wood). One other good thing about it is that it has got no sharp corners whatsoever. Very good for young children. I highly recommend it."
1,Not what I expected,We purchased the Mozart Magic Cube for our third daughter's second birthday. Our other children had one which has since worn out with use. Munchkin has purchased the rights to this toy from another company and it is completely lacking in the quality of the original toy. The original version had full sounding music which was a joy to listen to. The Munchkin version sounds 'tinny' and can get on your nerves rather quickly. The sound quality is extremely disappointing.
4,"Nice toy, a bit heavy!","This seems like a great toy for the musically inclined baby, my 5 month old likes looking at the flashing lights and trying to eat it the music doesn't seem too loud to me or out of tune, perhaps that is a defect for the previous reviewer? My son seems to love looking at it and pushing the buttons, I think once he is a bit older he might appreciate it more. However I do agree it is a great book shelf toy too. IT looks fantastic!"
1,Terrible sound for a toy that teaches about sound!,"Don't take my word for it, listen to the video clip on this sitel The sound is pretty horrible. I'm not sure how this is going to teach a baby to identify the sounds of the instruments featured, which is the purported goal of this toy. I'm sure that baby will have fun making the cube play sounds and pressing buttons, but to whose benefit? Yours? Hers? I think neither. If you have any interest in having baby learn the instrument sounds, check out a dvd for babies called Trebellina, which teaches the instrument sounds, note reading, and pitch. It is pretty amazing. I think the instruments are largely digital on there, but only a highly trained ear would know it."
2,Too noisy and bulky,"I was originally excited about this toy, but there are a few things I was disappointed about, mostly the lack of any volume control. It's either off or on, that's it! I think it's WAY too loud! It's also a little bigger and bulkier than I imagined. I definitely like the concept, I just think there are a few major improvements that need to be done!"
4,great idea,"great idea for a musical toy. i just wish the individual instrument sounds were a little more realistic. i might be a bit of a snob because i am a music teacher--but it seems like they could have done a better job with the sounds. still, the idea for the toy is great and i believe my son will really enjoy it as he gets a little bit older."
3,"Fun, but way too loud","Great idea, and fun for the baby, but so loud that I have actually wondered whether it is safe for my child's hearing. I can hear this toy all the way upstairs, in a totally different part of the house if it is playing in the living room. I have heard it TWO floors up at my parents' house. It is WAY too loud, and unfortunately there's no way to turn it down."
3,Great concept but terrible sound!,"I agree with some other reviewers- the idea of this toy is great. Teaching a child to hear good music and to listen close enough to hear the different instruments that contribute to the overall sound of a piece. Having the power to turn certain instruments on and off is fun and helps one hear the music in a different way. But my god the quality of the sound doesn't even attempt to sound like a real instrument. It's jarring and when my baby first heard it, she looked shocked and cried. Eventually she got used to it but do I really want her to get used to 'music' that is so electronified and distorted? Would love this if they had focused on the quality of the music instead of just getting it out there."
4,Munchkin Mozart magic cube,"I bought this product online for my 16 month old granddaughter. I was a little worried when I tested it myself before giving it to her. In a quiet room it seemed too loud and there was no way to control the volume.But on Christmas morning, with 5 of us in the room, the volume seemed fine. She knew right off the bat what to do with it. Some of the tunes even had her dancing. I think as she gets a bit older, she will figure out that each button makes a different sound.Unlike some of the reviews I've read, my daughter-in-law, who has a degree in Music Therapy was not turned off by the quality of the sound.All in all, I'm happy I bought it because my granddaughter seems to love it."
5,Great Toy,I bought this for my 9 month old nephew and he loves it. His 2 year old sister also likes to play it too... I would recommend this toy to anyone looking for a toy for a toodler.
4,Fun musical toy,"My niece is musically gifted at the age of 1, and I think she will love this toy. It is bright, colorful, and the instrument sounds are similar to the actual instrument the block depicts. It will be fun for a one year old to press the colorful block buttons to hear the sounds they make. If you are looking for a true-tone musical toy, keep looking. It is exactly what I expected from reading other reviews about theMunchkin Mozart Magic Cube"
2,boring,"i don't understand all the fuss about this toy. my daughter has had it since she was 6 months(now 1yr), and she and her playmates ignore it completely. she much preferred the learning drum which at least involves more than pressing one button. although i see, from the other reviews, that we are in the minority - for us this toy was a waste."
4,Might Not Be Worth The Price,"I bought the Magic Cube as a Christmas gift for my 18 month old niece. When it arrived, it was not what I expected. I definitely couldn't understand why it was worth $35. But regardless of how I felt about it, once my niece opened it she didn't want to play with any of her other gifts. I'm glad she really likes it, but I think next time I'll try to find something a bit less expensive for her to latch onto."
1,Don't bother,"This toy is LOUD and has no volume control. I think the reviews are all paid for or something, it's not interesting at all."
4,Very neat toy,"We bought our daughter the Mozart Magic Cube for Christmas and I think it is a really neat idea for a toy. You can add and subtract instruments from the score and it is a great way to learn how classical music works. The sound quality could be a little better, but you get used to it."
4,"""Durable"" Mozart","The Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube is ideal for those who are interested in introducing classical music (And the instruments that play it) to their children in a hands-on fashion from a very early age. The Cube is very durable, and the ability to change the sound by pressing the buttons is intriguing."
3,Too Loud,"I like the toy and my baby loves the music, but as an adult, I feel the music is way too loud for me, so it has to be too loud for my baby. I wish there was some kind of volume control on it since my baby would need to hold it closer to him to play with it.For now, we turn it on from a distance and the baby likes staring at the bright colors and listening to the music."
5,I love this toy!!,I'm grandma and I purchased the Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube for my grandbaby. It is precious. The bright colors light up and the music is beautiful. I love the way my grandbaby can choose various instruments to play the melody.I give this toy 5 stars. It was worth purchasing.Enjoy!
5,Best Toy Ever!,My daughter has played with this since she was six months old (she is now 1 year). She never tires of it and neither do her father and I. The Mozart melodies are wonderful.
1,What a Mess!!!,"I opened the package and immediately, I realized that this was not what I had expected. It was poorly made and the quality of the laminates was also poor. The laminate would peel-off if an edge happended to be slightly open. Also, the paper was a sticky mess. If you don't place the laminate correctly the first time, then say goodbye to your precious document. Don't even think about pulling the sticky paper off and re-doing it because it will rip or damage your document. Definitely a bad purchase. Beware!!!!"
5,The Coolest Laminator,"I have a YOU2 and was actually thinking of buying one for my sister-in-law. When I first opened the box, I thought there had been some mistake. The product was so compact and simple, that I was wondering if there were parts missing. But sure enough it was all there, and worked like a charm--no fuss, no muss, no bother. The pouches are much more convenient than the rolls you have to buy for other laminators. It gives you more control over the outcome. All in all, a great product! Great value!"
5,Good Value for my Dollar,"I just bought this laminator when I saw the inexpensive price. I am amazed at the good value for my dollar. I was looking for something quick and easy, and the YOU2 definitely fits the bill...So, i bought the YOU2 and am pretty happy. I saw the other customer reviews that raved about this product and thought that it must be pretty good to get the 5 star reviews from the other people. Well, I agree, and give it 5 stars myself...I now have a pretty handy, and portable, gadget to quickly protect all of my important documents. And i found it is very easy to use. The directions are clear, and I've had no trouble with it. The laminating pouches are pretty good too, but I have to buy some more now. I definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a quick and easy solution for laminating needs."
2,Im rating the service!!!!,I have not yet received my items. I payed for 2day air mail and it has been 3 days. (STILL NOT HERE) I am a bit upset that i payed that much money and did not get it in a timly manner.Really hope someone is going to do something about this situation!!!!
1,Save Your Money,This product is a complete waste of money. It is made of flimsy plastic and broke the first time we tried to use it. We eventually wound up using a heavy metal roller off of a machine tool to finish the job. It also only comes with 1 piece of plastic in each size which is inconvenient. There is absolutely no fixing this POC either. Don't waste your money.
5,Awesome product,"I am really *impressed!!* To be honest I did not realize this was *NOT* a heated laminator! (guess I should have read it more carefully!!) So when I got it I was hesitant to open it. After looking at it, I was not sure if I had made a good choice. **BUT** all that said, I did open it and tried it. *Wow*!!, I have used a school laminator that couldn't laminate as well as this. It really did the job. No heat, mess, or bubbles and very easy instructions to follow. Also I found refils in bulk at Sam's club, which was a great surprise!! I have already used the pages it came with and am ready to buy some more!!!! So I highly recommend this product!!"
1,A Rolling pin would do better.,"This a totallly unnecessary piece of plastic. Use a rolling pin, it will work better. I don't see why a person would need this thing. Save your money and purchase a hot seal laminator or stick with the rolling pin. It's USELESS. Difficult getting the laminating plastic through the device (rollers)."
1,Bad quality,"Unit was new, but useless....all the metal parts were fully rusted. Promptly returned it without even a chance to use it."
3,Okay Cool,"I thought it was sort of rickety the way you have to attach it to a table or counter top.I'm not too crazy about the manual operation. And, the paper it uses is kind of thin.But, for simple crafts and protection of kid's artwork, you really can't beat the price.I would recommend investing in a hot laminator for protecting more valuable items."
3,Good for the price,You get what you pay for. Although this is not a high tech laminator it does what it is intended to do. It arrived ready to use and I use is occasionally. I purchased additional laminating pouches at discount wareshouse chain.
3,product review,"This hat served it's purpose. I needed it for a particular look I was going for and it was perfect for that. I wouldn't call it my favorite cap, but it's certainly comfortable."
5,Internal SATA Hard Drive,Nice product. Came with nice power cable adapter if you don't have enough SATA power connectors. It's fast and quiet. Windows Vista says it's two notches faster than it PATA brother! It runs cooler too.
3,Works OK; missing power cord adapter,"Drive worked as expected once installed. WD's on-line product description (on WD's web site) said that it came with all hardware but, a SATA power cord adapter is not included and, must be supplied by the user as there is no standard Molex style power connector. Also, WD's product description and box state that the drive is compatible with Windows Vista but, version 11.3 of WD's ""Data Lifeguard Tools"" CD that was was enclosed with the drive, does not provide support for Vista systems."
2,Had to return,"I bought this harddrive for my sister to replace one that had gone bad. After I got it, the person that was going to install it told me that it wouldn't fit. And I would need and IDE harddrive. Returned Item and got a full refund within a few days."
4,Amazon sells the Retail Version,"The other poster states that you can get this drive for $50 less through the Manufacturer but fails to mention that they are selling the bare drive (oem) through Western Digital and Amazon sells the retail version which is always higher, which doesn't include data cable."
1,Not so good,"I brought this product so, like everyone, to have more storage, but the drive is not always found, it was not so easy to install, and very confusing. If I could return it I would."
4,Excellent Drive!!,"It's a great disk, it's very silent, easy to install and it has a very good price. The only thing that a didn't like is that it doesn't came with the SATA power connector but it can be found in the accesories of the motherboard. Great Hard Drive!!"
2,"Not the worst, but not great","This book does not offer anything in the way of even decent maps. It is tough to follow along with the text when you have no decent maps to look at. I have numerous other books on the Petersburg Campaign, and I found myself referring to the maps in these books repeatedly. The book does offer a coherent, concise analysis of the campaign in one book, which is an extremely valuable thing. You had better have other resources to look at while you read, though, or you won't pull anything useful from this book, aside perhaps from some information from the numerous excellent sidebars."
1,THE worst...,"I've read 100+ Civil War related histories, biographies, soldier accounts and such over the last four years - this is the absolute worst. An understanding of something as complex as the Petersburg aspect of the Overland Campaign demands coherent text and readable maps. This offering by Horn offers neither. One of the few instances where I learned nothing from my efforts."
2,file next to your least favorite Harmonia Moroney discs,"Pandolfo has the most pathetic technique of any da gambist on record. His tone is wussy, sawing timidly everywhere around the notes, avoiding rhythm completely. He makes his fine old instrument sound uncannily like Glenn Gould's humming. Totally enervating. Pandolfo's teacher was Savall whose own recording of these sonatas is an even more famous failure. On that recording he and Koopman somehow managed to give the impression that they were recording their parts in separate locations, neither performer playing with an acknowledgement of a collaboration. Here Pandolfo is lucky enough to be partnered with Alessandrini who plays gloriously. If only the harpsichord track could be isolated this disc would be a keeper. I'll stick with my Westminster LP of Janigro & Veyron-Lacroix - they are about the only one's who can make sense of these brilliant gems - which really aren't that difficult."
2,Passably cute,"My Love Patzzi is a short, ten-episode television drama about an unlikely pairing of two people looking for love who become good friends instead, but discover that love was right next to them all along. This drama is an incongruous mix of adult treachery with a love story the level of an innocent nave adolescent romance. My Love Patzzi is light fare, probably best for fans of Korean pop culture, but is a passably cute drama for the rest of us."
5,One of the best historical romances EVER!,"Oh, Laurie McBain was such a great romance writer! I really wish her books would go back into print so that today's writers and readers can see how it was done! Along with Virginia Henley and Beatrice Small, McBain's stories were some of the very first historical romances I ever read (way, way back in high school). They are true classics of the genre.This a romance / adventure / coming of age story between Elizabethan era Lily Christian and her sea-dog pirate captain, Valentine Whitelaw. While this is not an overtly sexual story (try Ms. Small's Skye O'Malley for that), it does contain one of the best romances I ever read. It contains everything great about the Elizabethan period, brave sea-dogs, bad Spanish spies, the new world, faires, and even a small cameo from Shakespeare.Truly this is a classic historical romance read. It's one that I hold all other up to."
1,A real let down. Choppy graphics.,"(I left the same review for all three volumes)After purchasing Atmospherex Exotic Robotics, I was really looking for another dvd with visuals and great music. This video was particularly amazing because of the clean smooooooth graphics.Amazon recommended this product to me, and in my excitement, I purchased vol 1 2 and 3!What a mistake. Within seconds of hitting play I was already dissapointed in the graphics. It was too choppy and didnt seem to follow the beat of the music in anyway shape or form.Please dont waste your time if you are looking for a psychedelic colorful fluid visual experience."
2,ok saw,"This is my second bow saw. I have a shorter one from other company which is excellent to cut any tree limbs up to 4 inches diameter. So, I want a bigger one. But, this is too soft. Many times the saw blade twist and cutting is not as effective as my shorter one. Big is not always good."
4,Unexpectedly Nice for adults,"I thought this movie was only for kids. I found that lots of kids in the theaters did not have a good time because the way of the movement of the Cartoon (very fast) and actor's speech rate (quite fast). I do like the realistic movement of catoon's face and natural speechs.For me (30+ years of age), The cartoon is quite nice and full of actions. 15 minutes of the beginning (intro about the story of the hero's life) is quite boring (I almost fell asleep), but when the casts got to Atlantis,the action began and went on non- stop to the end. Beautiful animation color, Nice & loud sound effect and very good and realistic actions (it reminded me of Tarzan, moving from tree to tree, all of the time). This animation contanied almost 50% of fast action. Big kids (boys) might like it. A group of 3-6 years girls sitted next to me couldn't understand the movies and couldn't stop playing with each others."
3,Hmm...,"I can see that Disney tried to be new and fun by going with a unique idea instead of its usual fairytale fare. This movie only partially succeeded. Some parts and characters were genuinely funny, but overall, this movie did not leave a great impression on me like many other Disney films did. Trying something new can be great, but it does not always work."
1,"Atlantis -- Much hype, no substance","The much hyped Disney feature, Atlantis bored our family. The plot is minimal and shallow. Most disturbing is the abundance of violence -- not the fantasy kind, but hitting, kicking, shooting guns, etc. My 5 year old couldn't stand it and my 8 year old was unimpressed."
2,I left bored and apathetic,"The story moves forward at a pretty quick clip, unfortunately sacrificing necessary character development along the way. When our hero is ultimately double crossed, I had a hard time caring. It seemed pretty obvious it would happen.Some beautiful animation along with some not-so beautiful, it didn't make up for the minimal story. And given the number of writers credited, along with the fact that ATLANTIS is strangely similiar to the anime NADIA from 10 years previous, you'd think they'd have that part worked out.Without ruining it, the end depends on some out-of-left field, unestablished robots, who seem more about being like THE IRON GIANT than staying within story context.It's been weeks and I still have no idea where that part came from.All in all, I left mildly bored."
2,"Disney artists are lazy, and this movie is boreing","The artwork is not very detailed, and their is a lot of computer animation instead of actual hand drawn animation.The story is boring, and there is not much humor.These complaints are typical of the past 4 years of Disney Movies. This is why I stick with Japanese Anime. Disney sucks!"
4,"good film, decent features","An amateur adventurer named Milo is obsessed with finding Atlantis, and after he is financed by an eccentric to become part of a team going there, Milo meets the Atlanteans and finds happiness with them. As one would expect, the animation is gorgeous and the designs are phenomenal, but there were also problems with pacing and plot. I don't think the explorers get to Atlantic until halfway through the film. Also, there is a lot of gunplay and a very long climactic battle. Boring. As for plot points ... well, that would spoil things, but don't use this film to teach your kids logic. We enjoyed the film, but neither adults nor kids wanted to re-watch the film. The voice cast was excellent. There are fewer dvd extras here than are usually found on Disney disks -- commentary and some info about the ""real"" Atlantis. Audio is in English or French, while subtitles are available only in English."
2,Boring much?,"I'm sorry, but if I had to choose one particular Disney film that really lost its audience, this would be it. Aimed at the teenage male crowd (me), it did not hit its mark. Atlantis drags on far too long for the story, and it seems that some of the scenes, like when the side characters share their personal stories, could have been left out for brevity. While it is creatively quite interesting and has really cool dvd menus, the film lacks any of the sparkle that makes other disney films attractive. It also utilizes a smattering of foolish and simple humor to try and win over the audience, but fails yet again.I hate to do this, but it is a rental, at best."
3,What happened to Disney?,"I'm not saying I dislike this style of animation, but this isn't anything like the Disney I, and all of my friends adore. The music is basically all background music and very little seems specially made for the movie. Disney movies have been going downhill for a while, but this really hit rock bottom. The last good movie was Road to Eldarado, what happened to the wonderful songs? Fabulous animation? Lion King, Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Mulan or even Road to Eldarado, those are the real Disney classics. I don't want to be too harsh, this was a good movie, just I miss the old Disney, and this isn't it. The characters are funny, though a bit stereotypical, and the plots a bit predictable and bland, and it's a decent movie, but just don't expect the usual Disney charm."
1,Atlantis,"Not very pleased. Ad says 2 disc special edition. All it really is is both movies, parts 1 & 2, & not a special edition @ all."
1,Another rip-off by Disney!!!,"This trashy Disney film is nothing but a rip-off of Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water, which is a wonderful japanese anime series."
4,I liked it. It's a departure from the normal formula......,"OK, granted....it's not as good as Lion King, or Beauty & the Beast but it's a step in a new direction...(unfortunatly, they have to work on a more cohesive story line). There are too many characters that needed more developement, & the love interest is not developed enough."
2,mmm-- I was put off by....,"The story line with a place for a female heroine is contemporary Disney. Unfortunately, the chain-smoking and violence left much to be desired. In one scene the mercenary slugs the old man in the gut -- and the old man dies -- this turned me off to the movie."
1,"Plagiarism, and an ugly one.","So far I've only read reviews and seen previews. Nevertheless it is clear to me, that this new Disney production is a cheap plagiarism of japanese anime ""Nadia and the secret of Blue Water"". The story is similar, the main characeters are similar (Milo=Jean, princess Kida=Nadia, Audrey=Hanson, Vinnie=Sanson, Helga=Grandys, commander Rourke=Gargoyle).Even the character design is a grotesque (and very ugly) copy of the abovementioned anime....Conclusion: see the original ""Nadia...""."
2,Weak by Disney Standards,"I was mildly disappointed with Atlantis. Michael J. Fox gives some life to the lead character, but the plot is weak and does not flow well. I think the requisite attempt at Political Correctness fails in this movie because of the parallel effort to be historically acurate with respect to dates.I think the movie would have worked better had the producers set the story in a more contemporary time frame. I found it absurd that a band of American mercenaries circa 1914 would include a late teen Latino woman. Yet the same character would have been very plausible in today's environment."
1,An all new low for Disney.,"Could not believe how hokey, sterotypical, and stupid this movie was overall. There are some great moments and nice backgrounds, and a fairly good story. But I found the drawings harsh and distorted, maybe a glorified sort of Pinky and the Brain type of animation. As in Road to El Dorado, Disney seems more interested in just how much skin to reveal on their heroines, how much innuendo and adult ""humor"" they can slip into the story--and this is supposed to be for kids? I was looking forward to this one from the trailers I had seen, and when I sat down to watch it with my niece we were both very disappointed. Don't bother--go get My Neighbor Totoro instead. Now THAT is a great film the entire family can enjoy, even if you don't have any kids!!"
1,fun but just a a plagiarism,"This movie depends very much on ""Nadia: The secret of Blue Water"", a japanese animation.You could see the similarity between them if you google ""Atlantis (by Disney) vs. Nadia""."
4,Good movie,"My wife and I took our grandsons to the movie and it had the appeal for both generations. The movie moved so that a seven and five year old stayed interested. Also, the dialogue and the animation appealed to my wife and me. The only draw back that I saw to the movie was the violence. It didn't bother either one of the boys, however, if a child doesn't like explosions and villians, they shouldn't see this movie."
2,Atlantis: the lost empire,"This movie was actually kind of weird. Not a typical Disney movie, although I don't know if there really is a 'typical' Disney movie lately.Toward the end it got kind of trippy and bizarre.It seemed like the plot wasn't actually all that strong, and there was such mystery surrounding everything - I mean, things weren't explained very well - that it was hard to get fully engaged in what was happening.It all seemed very rushed and some of it was just weird. Other than that the movie was kinda cool, I guess... it had its funny moments and its cool moments.Okay, I guess it wasn't the sort of movie I'd really want to see again. Not much strong characterization, not much strong plot, and some general bizarreness... it kind of gave me the impression of writers saying ""ehh, I know it lacks something, but I can't be bothered working on this thing for another minute"", like I do when I've finished an essay that is technically okay but strongly ""lacks something""."
5,Reviewed by PeaceKeeper,"This is one of the best Disney movies I have EVER seen!!! It should be destined to join the Lion King, as one of Disney's classics!! I would recomend it to anyone who is willing to watch it!! Watch this movie and have fun. If you like it, see the sequel. Do not judge a movie from what another person has said, see it and judge it for yourself. And of all things, enjoy yourself."
3,Pleasant but not very challenging,"There has been so much debate about the fate of Atlantis that one would think Disney could have dreamed up a more challenging video than this one. However, it's pleasant enough with some extremely funny characters. Michael J. Fox does a fine vocal performances and the artwork is lovely."
4,My 6 yr old son loves it,"As an adult, I've watched it a few times and I've enjoyed it. My son has watched it at least 20 times, and especially loves the underwater scenes. Based on his viewing time, I rated it higher than I would otherwise have rated it (3 stars)."
4,Atlantis,"I love this movie and so does my boyfriend. I got it for him as an anniversary gift. The first disc he got did not work, so I came back to the website and was able to get it replaced for free. Amazon.com is great; it's helpful, convenient, and makes sure the customer is happy!"
4,"Panned by critics, audiences, I loved it.","No it's not Beauty and the Beast - there are no songs! I loved Atlantis - it was an old fashioned ADVENTURE movie and I really enjoyed the ride. The sound on this DVD is amazing - if you have DTS, don't miss that track. Great movie I'll enjoy over and over."
3,"Unbelievable animation but, is that all?","I found the animation about the best if not the best in its craft I ever saw. The vocalizations were well casted. The problem was the story. It just wasn't very exciting. Unlike other classic animation epics, the story failed to draw me in and keep me captivated. The story was all too predictable and followed a standard formula. I know the movie was intended to be watched by children as well, but please don't go to all this great work to end up with a frankly boring story!"
2,"Disney loves their anime, and steals it too.","Decent flick that copies the anime ""Nadia"", just like the Lion King ripped off ""Kimba, the White Lion."" Disney steal...I mean, strikes again. At least they were wise enough to actually purchase the rights to Miyazakis films instead of copying them and calling them their own.Now if only they can start producing good animated films of their own instead of letting Pixar do all the work,or stealing them(see a pattern here?), then we might have something."
1,A crashing bore.,"So Disney is resorting to flatulence and belches for humor now? Turn down the sub-woofer or you'll end up with a booming headache. All action and no story, poor character development. HATED IT!"
1,Not a movie for Children,"I took my daughter to this G-rated movie and was very dissapointed to find Disney had couched a poorly re-made animated version of Raiders of the Lost Arc in a so-called movie about Atlantis. I suppose I should not have expected higher quality writing--but I certainly did not expect rampant, unrepentent voilence. The story of the mythical world was completely missing from this graphically violent cartoon full of death and distruction--which gets wholly brushed off by the characters This is NOT a movie for children should not be billed as such."
2,OOPS,"Much like the ill-fated TRON, this Disney spectacle fails to hit the mark. The story begins with a momentum and excitement that feels like the Indiana Jones movies, and one wishes it might have been live-action instead of animation. As the story quickly begins to lose all sense of logic and time and place, it becomes populated with a band of disjointed (even in their animated style) characters. They are intermittently funny, but as the adventure wears on, the story reveals an Atlantis, and its many strange secrets, as a bizarre, unlikable place. The over-the-top crystal concept is so strangely remote and undecipherable I can hardly imagine a 7-year old comprehending what the heck is going on. And the inconsistencies in the story are rampant."
2,Disney formula,"Disney took a good idea and made the worst of it. Combining elements from Raiders of the Lost Arc, STAR WARS, and Bay Watch, I wish I had taken the $34 we spent at the movies and bought some good books. The female heroine was a voluptuous, scantily clad girl. All of the other female characters were either very ""butch"". Milo was the typical glasses wearing, gaulky geek, that Disney has made famous. Realizing this was a fantasy I was prepared for a stretch in the story line, but Milo keeping his oversized glasses on throughout the whole movie, under water, dangling from a hot air balloon, and the escapes from falling down tunnels and off of bridges was just too much. This might be a good rainy day rental but I would encourage you not too waste your time or money on the big screen. The 10 year old boy I was with was not impressed much either."
1,Could some more people have died?,"This is not the usual Disney type of movie. In the movie, over 150 people died for the all too typical greed of money. The jokes and animation used in the film are for kids, but I don't think the movie is very family oriented. There are other better movies out there and I defiantly wouldn’t recommend this one."
1,Not for Kids!,"My kids were really looking forward to seeing Atlantis, but boy were we disappointed! First, the plot was hard for me to follow, nevermind the young children who are the intended audience. Also, a chain-smoking character is not appropriate for a children's movie. I'm glad Disney is trying to do something different, but I think they've lost sight of who the movie's intended auidence is."
1,Booooooring and not for kids,"Atlantis must have a demographic out there somewhere that likes this sort of crap, but for 90% of you out there reading this review right now, trust me and skip it. Anime fans might be willing to sit through this, but kids and adults are both likely to come away disappointed. My wife and I could barely finish this movie, we were so uninterested. Part of the problem is that characters are not well-developed (except for the females, in true Disney fashion,if you know what I mean). The animation is nowhere near as good as you expect from a true Disney production; it's more like a bad Saturday morning flick that you don't understand why your 8 year old enjoys. I'm really surprised that Michael J. Fox lends his name to the lead character, actually. Watch an old Disney movie instead for kids, or Shrek if you are over 10 and still want to be entertained."
3,Very underrated. BUT NOT FOR KIDS!,"So why 3 stars? First off, even though I think this is underrated, It is not something you want to watch with your kids at 8:00. The movie deals with some pretty heavy stuff. Kida, wheres next to nothing, Mr. Rourke gets way to scary at the end and some of the humor is pretty sick. If I didn;t have kids, I would rate this 4.5 stars, but this is not a typical disney movie. I gues sif your kids have watched Star Wars or Star trek, you might not have much of a problem."
2,Tries TOO hard to be serious,"This was a fair movie.It had decent action and a few funny moments,but it was ruined by half-hearted animation and it tried to be TOO serious.The plot was made half-enjoyable by an overkill of action and death.It wasn't as good as ""Pocahontas,"" ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Lion King"" or """"Hunchback of Notre Dame.""The songs were kind of forgettable and the movie seemed to lag in drama and humor.This was an action filmed that sadly was destroyed by TOO much action and not enough other elements."
3,Best Disney Film In Years,"I am a teenager, and I thought that this was a kid's movie when I first went to go see it, but I soon learned the truth. While it may not contain any adult subject matter, this is not only for little kids! The story is good, but the animation is what really sells this movie. It tells the story of a historian obsessed with Atlantis who is hired to lead an expidition to find the lost city. What he doesn't know is that the archaeologists that he's with aren't exactly who they say they are. This movie is great for most ages, because, ironically, toddlers probably won't like this movie. There are many battle scenes, and the story may be too complex for them."
3,"Muddled movie, but what a package!","This action-adventure never seems to know if it's meant primarily for teenagers or family audiences. As a result, nothing in this film ever quite works. The suspense fails to build, the action scenes fail to thrill, and the characters fail to make much of an impression. Although the film holds up pretty well on television, it still doesn't amount to much.The numerous extras on the _Atlantis_ Collector's Edition DVD are well worth viewing, especially since they give an idea of the tremendous creative effort wasted on the film itself."
4,A great anamated Action film.,"This was inpressive! I never thought Disney would do something cooler than this. It is NOT STUPID. It was very cool,intelligent, good and most of all AWSEOME! You shoul go see Atlantis. It is mostly for pre-teens but little kids would like it too. Adults will think it is very intresting. My brother really loved it. We might get the videotape. Once again Here's why you should see Atlantis.01.Expect a killer-voice-talent.02.An awesome almost true story plot.03.The Best Film From Disney!"
5,Atlantis...Disney goes for the glory!,"Im a 19 male just out of high school who went to watch this movie on a first date. Well I haven't seen the girl recently but I have seen the movie 3 times since. It is great. It has a great storyline and each of the characters have there own personalities that really set them out. Everybody is dogging this movie for what it didn't have....they need to notice what it DID have. A great Action-Adventure flik without all the boring, childish songs. It even has a touch of romance in it between Milo(The main character) and Kida (a beautiful Atlantian princess). This movie is great for children, teens, and adults. Its hard to make a movie that will entertain all 3 of those...lets give Disney some credit. Go watch it!!!"
2,Dive into 'Atlantis'.,"This movie is an okay sort of movie. Not the greatest one I've seen. It does not have the greatest animation, because there all shapes. There hands are very strange too. The movie has a good plot, but is certainly not as good as, 'Tarzan' or 'Beauty and the Beast' but is certainly an enjoyable film. Michael J. Fox does a really good voice as Milo, the explorer looking to find 'Atlantis'. Well, I recommend this movie only to kids and maybe adults. It is enjoyable to kids and be sure parents you will get a thank you after the movie from your kids! They will certainly love it!"
3,Had some pretty scenes.,"I thought review in Entertainment weekly saying all Atlantis's effects are old and inferior to Sherk's dazzling digital effects(Which I loved) were too harsh, they sure have been used before, but were still nice. Most of the little kids in the theater seemed to enjoy them. There were some funny characters in the film, but over all the movie lacked creativity. I was expecting a lot since the subject Atlantis is so interesting, I wanted to know more about Atlantis, and didn't like Atlantis been so advanced. Ancient doesn't have to be magical, I like it to be more real, more deep feelings."
5,REALLY GREAT FOR 5 AND OVER,"I thought that this was a terrific animated flick. There are some people who kind of die, but you don't get that Bambi's mother or Simba's Dad tug at the heart-strings. The action was great, and the voice acting was terrific! Highly recommend this one. I liked it alot more than those sobby Pocahontas or Hunchback animated tries. This one had alot more thought and effort. But it used now while it is a great deal. The used prices tend to go up in a few weeks."
2,Dissapointing...,"I had much higher hopes for this movie. For starters, there was no character development at all. Milo was the only one that we knew anything about and who anyone could possibly relate to, but even his relationship with his grandfather was more contrived than usual for a Disney film. I was shocked at the way that the film tried to include minorities-- in a very type-cast/stereotypical way. There was an Italian who worked in a floral shop, a smelly dirt-loving Frenchman, and a Latina woman who's highest ambition was to open an auto shop. The ""international"" cast did more harm than good. The scenes were choppy and the characters more flat and uninteresting than normal for a Disney movie. The most interesting part was Atlantian-- the artificial language. ..."" Suggestion: don't bother. Spend your money on something worthwhile like Shrek...."
2,great character design/animation....... thats all.,"once upon a time.. there was a company called disney.... who cared about having a great story with strong character developement throughout thier journey. the laughter, the drama, and the spectacular animation. well the only thing atlantis has going for it is the animation and great character design. the story is bland and uninteresting. the love story is just the styrophome inside the box before you move all of that fluff out of the way. if you look at the death of the father scene in atlantis, and the death of the father scene in the lion king, you will see what i mean as far as drama, and how atlantis lacks very much in it. overall, its just plain disappointing."
2,Atlantis: The Lost Chance,"Not good. And what a missed opportunity. Whatever happened to the Disney ethic: it's only cartoons, nobody gets killed! Violent flaming death, desecration and destruction of ancient civilizations, and ugly greedy-minded characters. And this is supposed to be a Disney film. Even chain smoking is given precious Disney airtime. Walt must be turning in his grave! I suggest that the talentless, unimaginative and over-paid creatives who put this dull and hackeyed story together, sit down in the archives and pull out the reels of Snow White & The Seven Dwarfs, and re-acquaint themselves with the concept of: F.A.M.I.L.Y E.N.T.E.R.T.A.I.N.M.E.N.T. This appaling film only gets two stars: one for the Disney hallmark, and, one for the poster (even though is looks like an Asia album cover). Hopefully, this film will sink beneath the waves...quickly!"
2,"Shall We Call it ""Dumb"" or ""Dumber""?","Okay . . . it's a kids' movie. You don't have to reduce the entire content of a movie aimed at the under-10 crowd to pablum, however. Disney should know that as well as anyone. The fact that this ho-hum piece should show up in the same season as the inspired brilliance of ""Shrek"" is somehow ironic.Does anyone over 10 actually believe that everyone in this supposed civilization has forgotten how to read? Does anyone care, considering how lifeless and flat the ""Atlanteans"" are (with the obvious exception)?Yep, the animation was terrific. The voice-over work was outstanding in spots. If you aren't in the target age-bracket, though, be prepared to be bored . . . for a long time."
1,atlantis: the copy cat,"this is another example of disney's hardwork in copying the story frame of other movies. the japanese's 'laputa: the castle in the sky' (http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Bay/6800/laputa/), which is a 12-year-old movie, has the exact same story frame.the difference is -- the atlantis is talking something burried under the sea."
5,good family movie,The Story is well written and scripted. Michael J. Fox is excellent one of his best performances. I highly reccomend this DVD.I really liked the animation as well
3,A halfway decent Disney movie....,"No singing teacups or lions in this one, thank goodness, but it was'nt perfect either. Some people did'nt like the fact that people got crushed, burnt up, drowned and beaten to death in Atlantis; it was not a little kiddie movie. Personally, I think its better to show the fact that when a sea monster hits you over the head you don't just say ""ouch"". Atlantis is a classic fantasy adventure film with adventure film elements.The story was pretty good and the sound in this DVD is truly wonderful but my big problem with Atlantis is the animation: Some of the visuals were very compelling but it could have been alot better. All the people look like they were put through a taffy pulling machine and sometimes the images looked extremely blocky (maybe this was caused by the transfer to DVD process?).Imagine if they used the same technology that was employed to make ""Final Fantasy"", now that would have been amazing."
3,finally not singing animals!,"i saw the movie three times when it was showing. i must say i am very impressed that disney actually made a decent animation that is away from singing animals, objects... etc and actually target not just the kids but adults! unfortunately, i have also seen a japanese animation series named ""nadia"" - which was aired in japan more than ten years ago - that have many similarity to atlantis. not just teh character design, but plots, actions and scenes! maybe because the two are based on jules verne's ""20,000 leagues under the sea""... but come on disney! at least drew the character differently and change some of the scenes for god's sake if you 'borrowed' idea from somewhere else! anayway. having say that this is an enjoyable movie. very anime like from disney. i would recommend people to rent ""kiki's delivery service"". disney, keep it going! and be more creative with the next one please."
2,Atlantis,"Tired of buying over hyped DVD's. This is a plot from a 50 year old ""B"" Movie, and a little of 60 year old Flash Gordon. It's not much more than that. The only plus was sound, but not worth the $... I paid for it. Very, very few movies are lately."
2,Maybe it's just because im not ten anymore.,"""Thumbs Down!""Somebody help with this boring animated Disney flick! It was supposed to be a great adventrous one with cute humor! This film just tries to pass as something original, but is really a copy of Indiana Jones, just put into Disney's version. Children may be amazed with this movie, but I sure can't understand what is so wonderful about it. Half of the characters are just annoying, as is the offbeat humor. This could run for worst film of the summer."
1,DISNEY'S FADING MAGIC!!!!!!!!!!,"after watching this film i must admit that disney has lost its creative edge. it has hit an all time low with ""atlantis: the lost empire"". the film fails to impress in any respect. it is a sheer waste of time. moreover it bears the similarities with hayao miyazaki's masterpiece ""laputa: castle in the sky"" and ""nadia: secret of blue water"" which again works against it.wonder where disney's good old days of ""beauty and the beast"",""the little mermaid"" and ""the lion king"" are gone.just couldnt believe, the people at disney are so out of ideas!"
3,Not exactly your typical Disney,".... animated film. The animation is good -- everything you'd expect from a Disney production; but the story is a little diffuse and lacks the song titles which have given Disney animated films their charm. I also felt the plot was a little 'forced'.In all truth, this is not a bad movie, just not as good as some of their other titles. For all the advertisement that preceeded the release (both theatrical and the DVD release) I guess I just expected more.The DVD itself is clean and crisp and contains some bonus material -- something the earlier animated films lacked. Bonus material includes an audio commentary with the producer, deleted scenes, a virtual tour of the CG model of the sub 'Ulyses' and the leviathan, and a guide on how to speak 'Atantean' (useless but interesting).All in all, one of the weaker titles but still worth a look.** mildly recommended **~P~"
4,Atlantis--Interesting...,"This movie is about a linguistics expert who is disheartedly kept from his quest--to find the lost city of Atlantis... When the main character runs into an old friend of his deceased grandfather he discovers that the Shepard's Journal was already found (by his grandfather), Milo (voice of Michael J. Fox) sets out with a makeshift crew in search of Atlantis...This movie, by Disney, is not up to the flair of other Disney movies. There is very little that can be considered truly comical, but plenty of adventure and mystery to keep you on the edge of your seat. This movie serves to spark some curiousity around the possibility that the lost city might actually exist. The movie is well done, and done with such careful precision to detail what the lost city might actually look like... The movie would be better computer animated, but we'll just have to wait and see...Not too bad, but not the usual flair... A-"
4,Atlantis DVD,"It's a good movie. It's funny. It's good entertainment for kids and adults. I like buying through amazon, as I can get the DVD used, and pay a fraction of the cost."
4,A new type of Disney film,"This not your usual Disney film, with all the music. The best thing about this movie has to be the aniamation, it's awesome."
1,Utterly Disappointing,"When I think of Disney, I do NOT think of an un-even film that depends upon horrible animation and an even poorer plot...yet this is exactly what I received with 'Atlantis'. As for the use of a mythical and historically unproven (as yet) hypothesis as a story line, I think it's time to go back to the drawing board."
1,wow,"wow....sarcasticly. this was the worst kids movie i have ever seen. it is the worst overall movie i have ever seen. it sucked. wow...i hate Kirk Wise. he should be failing life. its true, even though this brought in some rediculous amount of money that it shouldnt have. i have to tell you a story. one day, i got up, went to school, came home, did my homework til midnight, and went to sleep. this is my schedual. This movie didnt add to my schedual, it made it worse. if fact, it ruined the whole week. i hope this movie dies."
4,I enjoyed it,"Even though i was expecting a bit more deep story on Atlanits, i still liked the film, it had some great action, wondeful music, the voice acting was really good, the animation was very good also,and the story was too, i think that Disney did something really good, trying to get into a new territory, and it quite works, but Atlantis should have been a live action film,but i still like it animated."
2,Not up to par for Disney,"I was very disappointed in this movie. It is NOT up to Disney standards. 1)The animation was Television quality. They have gone from exceptional animation quality (from Little Mermaid through Aladdin)to this new straight-line, squared-off. ""Anime'"" type drawing. It's terrible! 2)Also the story line was violent with too much fighting and warfare, whereas you normally expect jokes and comedy between a main character and his sidekick, from Disney.Overall, I was very disappointed and would not recommend this Disney movie to anyone, especially young kids."
2,"""Naa, let's just make this look like it's for children""","Much like the ill-fated TRON, this Disney spectacle fails to hit the mark. The story begins with a momentum and excitement that feels like the Indiana Jones movies, and one wishes it might have been live-action instead of animation. As the story quickly begins to lose all sense of logic and time and place, it becomes populated with a band of disjointed (even in their animated style) characters. They are intermittently funny, but as the adventure wears on, the story reveals an Atlantis, and its many strange secrets, as a bizarre, unlikable place. The over-the-top crystal concept is so strangely remote and undecipherable I can hardly imagine a 7-year old comprehending what the heck is going on. And the inconsistencies in the story are rampant."
3,Animated version of SG1,"I couldn't help but notice the similarities. Some obvious, some I had to look for. Milo is Daniel Jackson, his background even the same. The cartoon even looked like him. The storyline too similar to the original Stargate movie. Vinnie, with a few extra touches is Jack O'Neill, Audrey is a black haired Sam Carter. Teal'c is so obvious I won't go there. Christopher Judge must have been the model for the cartoon image. All that was missing was the gold tatoo. And of course, Commander Rourke, the infamous Colonel Maybourne. I saw this movie for the purpose of escape and entertainment, but ended up seeing Stargate SG1 in animated form."
3,The artwork is starting to become amazing.,"There is some seriously excellent artwork in this movie. This excellence is not consistent howevr. I am not sure how that inconsistent artwork happens, lazy director, different teams working on different parts of the movies, don't know. The same thing happens with comic books also. The quality suddenly drops off and then returns. We give it 3 stars for the story which is OK but not worthy of more than 3 stars. There are times when the story make one roll their eyes. As a Disney movie we do like 22 movies better, but 27 less.Wow. With 315 reviews already written and an Amazon sales rank of 909 this is one of the most popular movies of any genre. Of the 50 animated movies we are ranking this would be 16 on Amazon. We liked it also, but ranked it 23rd out of 50."
4,"""You have disturbed the dirt!""","Milo Thach is looking for the lost empire of Atlantis. He gets up by Mr. Whitmore, a friend of Milo's father. Mr. Whitmore gives Milo a submarine and a crew to look for the legendary city. This movie is better suited for a somewhat older age group, but it's still fun!"
3,It's Ok,"It doesn't shine out like some other animation films. The underlying character art comes out looking angular and blocky (triangular fingernails?) when the movie has such a watery theme that a more gracefull style might have suited it.Technically, well done, aesthetically not quite there. Cannot remember any of the music either. Still, good enough to stay in the library."
3,It's potential as elusive as the lost continent itself,"The action sequences are astounding, the sound is impressive. Yet all the bombastic drama we witness at the very beginning is severely marred by character development more akin to a Tex Avery cartoon. Serious and humorous material doesn't seem to meld very well here. There is some good gag material, but all in all I find the movie lacking in spirit. Still, Atlantis - The Lost Empire has its good moments that will keep kids glued to the TV (and a good deal less painful than Titan A.E.)."
5,WHY ARE PEOPLE COMPLIANING???????????,I thought this movie was great. Why is press so bad. I enjoyed the whole thing. Even my sister enjoyed it and she didn't want to go. it is a great family movie. Some scenes were a bit rushed though. Otherwise I loved it. Go see it.
1,Some DVD players will not run this DVD,"Go to Google.com and put in ""Atlantis, dvd, menu, problem"" and read the issues related to this problem.The DVD just cycles thru the previews without allowing you to watch the feature Atlantis. The Lost Empire is really lost to me.Steve"
3,"Anime style Disney animation is just that, Anime","No, I am not a fan of the Japanese phenomenon known as anime. Personally, I think the classic styles used by Disney in the past, as well as newcomers Fox Animation Studios and Dreamworks, are a much higher standard of animation and should be the benchmark by which future Disney and other studios use for their animated films. Why regress an art platform rather than improve upon it? Once you get past that, the story is somewhat interesting, and the DVD is loaded to the max with features. Had Disney used the original animation treatment for the film, I would have given it 5 stars."
2,"Nice, but with problems","I've seen the movie and enjoyed it, but found that the first DVD loops on Magnavox DVD players so the movie never plays, but gets stuck on the (really boring) trailers.Kind of a problem. Be aware of this. Disney is no real help when addressing this.The second DVD (with the extras) is really cool."
4,great film,"Folks, my kids loved it, so did dad. I think this is the best Disney film since the lion king. Lately Disney has produce movies with a lot of songs and no substance. This movie has substance, it has a story, it has action, and it has romance. Kids will like this movie because it keeps their attention. While, I think they could have made the movie a little long, this would have allowed Disney to lead a little better in to some of the story lines. But all around it is a darn good film. I am proud of Disney on this one. The only disappoint I had was previews before hand, there is a movie coming out can't remember who it was by, but the language for a preview, was not cool at all. My little one was say He!! Afterwards and had to try and convince her that it was a bad word. That could have been a little different not sure if Disney controls this or not.Because of the shortness, 4 stars..."
4,Best Disney Flick in a while,"First of all, there was no music. Thank God. I loved this movie. I want to see it again. I grant, there were parts where the story got lost due to bad writing, but through most of it it was very good. The animation was very good (as compared to some of the previous Disney movies) and the sound was great. Finaly, a Disney movie that adults can watch and not feel suicidal tendencies."
4,Enjoyed the movie,I enjoyed this movie so much I purchased the DVD only to findthat it won't play on my DVD player. I have returned it andhad the same problem. I contacted Disney and they were supposedto send me a new one but have not recieved it. Hope to getit eventually. I didn't think this movie was a bad choicefor Disney. I really enjoyed it. Thanks Disney.
3,Great flick -- TERRIBLE transfer,"I am a died-in-the-wool Disney and anime freak, and I loved this movie when I saw it in the theater. I always like to see Disney stretching their bounds (I really liked Black Cauldron, too), and the action-oriented homage to anime worked great.However, I was very disappointed in the DVD. Unlike any Disney transfer before it, Atlantis was filled with horrible jaggy lines (aliasing) that I found very distracting. This on the 2-disc collector's edition, no less. What up, Disney?"
3,"Beautiful, beautiful photos...BUT","The photographs in this book are magnificent. It succeeds as an art book.But no information is provided about the insects, not even their names. If you wonder if you recognize an insect, there is no way for you to check. If you see an insect that you'd like to learn more about, too bad. If you'd like to use the book as a teaching tool, you can't unless you're able to identify the insects yourself. I find this to be a huge flaw.There are other books available that have just as beautiful photos of insects but that have the courtesy to identify what you are looking at."
4,Pleasant music beautifully played,"Perfect music for a dinnerparty or settling a toddler for supper. I enjoyed discovering this disc, not having come across many ""Guitar Quintets"" before. I was sceptical, knowing the famous horrid ""Boccherini's Menuet"" from youthful Eisteddfod attempts, but the Haydneseque textures and easy tunefulness have a special charm. A classical composer, his work reminds of Haydn more than Mozart and never becomes terribly profound, an atribute I found quite refreshing. Clear the ears and mind with some lighter - never frivolous - transparently textured chamber music, but also check out the NAXOS versions for a cheaper and beautifully performed alternative and get two volumes for the price of this one."
4,Near Perfection,"Handsome, young and morally corrupt Dorian Gray has his portrait painted. Soon after, under the influence of the incorrigible Lord Henry Wotton, he betrays his fiancee, leading to her suicide. As the years pass Dorian does not age but evidence of his narcissim are apparent in his portrait which grows uglier with each transgression. His mysterious behavior and ageless appearance begin to attract suspicion. This is one of my favorite stories by Oscar Wilde. This movie has everything that a good movie should have."
3,Disappointing,"Although the movie stays pretty much close to the book, it's disappointing. George Sanders performance is over the top with speech more rapid fire than Shatner. Very distracting. The supernatural part is attributed to a mystic cat statue when the book offers no explanation for the painting's transformation."
4,Outstanding film !,"I buy this Dvd because I remembered watching bits of this film many years ago during my childhood and I must say I was greatly surprised with the quality of the film , the magnificent performances (George Sanders shines) and the amazing script which reflects the essence of Oscar Wilde's celebrated novel. I highly recommend this dvd."
5,Release this dvd...................,I have a copy that was already rleased in europe but cannot play becuse it is region 2. Why does europe get movies before here? please issue this movie now..................
4,The Picture of Dorian Gray,"This classic film is a ""must see"" for fans of the macabre. In addition, the costuming and set decor were brilliant. Although I knew the outcome, I remained glued to the screen because the plot ran at a good pace and never seemed to lag. Great makeup job on D G's decomposing face!"
5,Watcher,My mum loved this dvd. She's been after this for a very long time ! She said give it five stars for quality! Very good condition!
4,It is a movie of humanity.,"Comparing the movie and the novel The Picture of Dorian Gray,I think the movie is more humanized that the novel. I think the character Miss Gladys is very important.She is an angel of Basil.Though Basil is killed,he succeeds in converting Dorian at last.So. Dorian prayes when he is dying. I want to know what you think about Gladys' role in the movie. Everyone is welcome to discuss it with me."
2,"Earnest, plodding and lowbrow",All the life and demonic intelligence has been drained from the story. Leave it to Hollywood.The exaggerated grotesqueness of the portrait is a terrible lapse of directorial judgment.
1,Dreadful,"This movie was simply dreadful. Hurd Hatfield may be the most wooden actor ever to star in a movie. He also was way too old for someone who is supposed to look like he's in his early 20's throughout the movie. I didn't for a second believe that Donna Reed's character would have been pining all those years for a character so charmless and robotic. And the usually wonderful George Sanders played one of his patented quick-talking smarmy characters but without any of the wit, charm or menace he showed in so many of his performances, including All About Eve and Rebecca. Only a young Angela Lansbury shined in a poignant performance. Except for her, the Picture of Dorian Gray was a cold, depressing pretentious bore."
2,What the...?,"We had to watch this movie in my English class and it totally sucked! The music was corny and i couldn't tell what the hell was going on. It would skip from one scene to another and you couldn't follow the plot. Am I supposed to know who ""this"" person is just from one scene?! I didn't get it at all. The only good part was the changing of the painting. That part I did get."
4,A great 40's classic!,"The picture of Dorian Gray is one of those films that sits somewhere between melodrama and goth-horror.It is the only dark story that Oscar Wilde wrote. Which makes it more of a worthy introduction Oscar's writings.It is unfortunet that film adaptations this story never rise to equal its subject matter.This 1940's filming comes as close to book as possible. Since this film. there has been others. Two made in the 70's. One starring the late Helmet Berger.And a updated made for TV version starring Susan Lucci as Dorian. (which would make for a great collector's dvd!)Even Dan Curtis of Dark Shadows fame, did a version in the early 80's.I hear that there is a British made 2009 adaptation staring the young actor who played Prince Caspian in the 2ed part of C.S.Lewis's Nardia series.that will soon be available here on dvd. It is suppose to be even closer to what Oscar Wilde had envision of Dorian Gray."
4,The Picture of Dorian Gray,"For some inexplicable reason, Amazon has removed the rate-movie feature from the main product page. One must now write a review in order to rate a movie and generate recommendations. This is not a review, but merely a means to allow me to rate this movie and improve my recommendations. If you are as annoyed by this new ""feature"" as I am, please register your protest w/ Amazon help."
2,"Overpriced, flimsy","Works as intended, but am dissatisfied with the quality -- very flimsy material for the price. $20 seems more reasonable."
4,retro spotlight,"They could be a little more heavy weight, but other than that they work well, and give off a lot of light."
2,Not as nice as it looks,"This lamp is OK. I really liked the styling of it - was looking for a bit of glam ""Old Hollywood"" - but the construction is a bit flimsy. It's also not really good at illuminating the room, it's more of a spotlight."
