5,Rock & Blues Oriented,"The Hyde Park concert presented in this DVD was recorded during the From the Cradle tour and released a couple of years ago on VHS. Coming from the MTV Unplugged success Clapton opted for a return to its blues roots playing blues standards as well as modern blues songs among other rock tunes. The results are spotless with Clapton and the band in top form. To note, Clapton concerts through the 90's until the present time are quite an experience as he has teamed with the best musicians in the business. This concert is no exception.The set features some great Clapton signature songs and covers as I Shot the Sheriff, Badge, Five Long Years and others. The DVD set does not add much to the VHS release as there are no extras on it. The sound both stereo and Dolby Digital is very good."
3,A decent sampler if you ca nget it cheap enough,"Buy this one used only if you can find it cheap. The music is great, but there are only 14 songs, and even though frenesi, and Begin the Beguine are here, where is Summit Ridge Drive, Back Bay Shuffle, and a plethora of hits and important tracks. 27 songs could fin here, why only 14??? Find the ""Bein the beguine"" cd on bluebird, it's better for a one disc overview and buy the gramercy five cd too, but only get this one if you can find it cheap, it is a good cd, and has billie holiday singing any old time, and a good summertime too. good cd, not ennough songs considering there are so many better shaw cd's to choose from, also check out the box set, that this cd is culled from, i'm gettin it when i get some mo' dough. papi chulo says buy this cd only if u can get it cheap"
1,highlights are very dim,What a bummer of a CD---the highlights are mostly truncated tunes. No real pleasure in listening to snippets that represeent no thought and planning. No wonder there are over 60 used CD's on thye market today!. Shame on Orrin Keepnews!
4,Medieval Women,"Though short (only 44 pages), this book proves to be an excellent resource- and interesting reading- for anyone who wants to find out more about the role of women in the middle ages. This book contains a general overview of the options available to medieval women, and many of the duties that they performed. It talks about topics such as ""the lady of the manor"", ""nuns in the convent"", and general topics like this. The book is a great source to use to get a better feel for the time period. While the book is a secondary source, it also contains small snippets from primary sources to back up its points and statements. A bibiliography in the back makes it possible for you to track down any of the primary sources if you want. Easy reading, informative, and interesting, this is a great book!"
2,"Good Reporting Has ""Left"" the Building","""The Killer Bees"" are made out to be heroes by Heard, who covered Austin politics for many years as an AP reporter. Though interesting at times, it is fatally flawed by being chock full of spin. When reporters can shed any veil of objectivity and cut loose to deify the Democrats, hang on to your hats, kids. Even the title declares their actions a ""miracle"".This is, in short, a 124 page cheer for the Democrats, dressed up as a history lesson. Be not fooled.Heard is actually a good writer, but was obviously too emotionally involved in this case to put together a cogent account of the subject matter. He is better when focused on other passions, such as his sportswriting. The Killer Bees made some waves, but Heard makes the event out to be the watershed event in Texas political history. The drama in 1979 was palpable, to be sure, but really...take it easy. A more objective writer would let his reader make the decisions. Leave this one on the shelf."
3,In Agreement with Bob Woodward,"I was eager to hear Tenet's side of the story. To my surprise, my perception is, as Bob Woodward describes so well, that Tenet condemns himself in the book. Overall the book is poorly written and edited. Nothing really new is exposed. I'm sure many people in the CIA and FBI were pleading for action while the so-called leaders were playing ""yes"" men. Somehow we have to solve the problem of limp leadership."
2,Insights from the oblivious George Tenet,"Tenet comes across remarkably unaware of the world around him, while simultaneously revealing intriguing conversations within the halls of our government. The fatal flaw of the book is the utter failure to recognize his own shortcomings or failures under his watch. He does so artfully though, simultaneously projecting an air of humility while really being quite blind to any failings. In the end, it projects a tone of ""aw, shucks, I guess I really was pretty smart"" which just doesn't jibe with the reality of the recently disclosed 2005 report from the CIA inspector general that outlines many of the CIA's failings under Tenet's leadership. This is a painful read (to see a guy so clueless and without any sense of self-awareness), but compelling enough to finish (to understand some of the mechanics of how we got ourselves into this mess)."
4,At the center of the storm,"Although this book is voluminuos it is very insightful and a must read for contemporary critics and pundits of the recent politics. To read the behind the scenes, day to day banter and politics from the CIA directors point of view is absolutely fascinating and compelling. If you heva ever seen George on any of his interviews he is magnetic and charismatic at the core. A very bright man that has made his mark on history and has shared his stories for all to see and hear. Cathartic or not one of the best reads in the past few years for me. I also have passed this around to a few friends and each peson has cherised the read."
5,At the Center of the Storm: My Years at the CIA,"Excellent Quality, Timely Receipt, Excellent Price. Will definitely use again and recommend to associates.Dr. John N. Parrigin, CPP, CFE"
4,Still at the center of the storm,"As someone that likes to read all side of a story, I find this book well written. It is definitely worth the read beyond the 60 Minutes sound bites. But the cloud will still persist over George Tenet head as only a part of the story. When it comes to understanding Saudi Araba and what the CIA was doing there, I find the bookIf Olaya Street Could Talk -- Saudi Arabia: The Heartland of Oil and Islamas a more objective book on the subject."
2,Center of Storm = Not My Fault,"This book started out OK but quickly evolved into something that should have been titled ""Not My Fault"" (except someone else already used that title). It has some good information but for the best part seems to be Tenet's personal defense of all the criticism the CIA has received during his tenure."
2,A disappointed reader,"I had anticipated a more direct, clearly expressed and no nonsense book. I did not received what I anticipated. Tenet plays games with his readers ever as he appears to do on his TV interviews.I hear excuses, but I do not hear valid reasons for his failure to pull the plug on the president's insane drive to invade Iraq with only unverified intelligence at his disposal."
2,A Detached Manager of the Nation's Intelligience,"I started reading this book with great respect for George Tenet. I finished it somewhat disappointed with him. My overall interpretation of what he has written is that many of the ""mistakes"" that were made were due to his detachment from many of the details of important intelligence information handled by the CIA. Many times he infers and outright states that ""such and so was handling this and I should have paid more attention to it"". I don't think anything George Tenet did or didn't do was done with malice, rather he was just not competent in the position he was in. It is not uncommon for a ""star"" performer at lower levels to rise to their level of incompetance. This is true in business and government. I have no doubt he was doing his best, but was simply the wrong man for the job at that time. However, hindsight is always 20/20."
4,BETTER LATE THAN NEVER,"Tenet spills his guts now? Better late than never.This is actually a fascinating book in many ways. Tenet is a very emotional, wears-his-heart-on-his-sleeve type, which is surprising considering he was leader of the CIA. You'd expect him to be taciturn and secretive. Instead he's forthcoming, engaging, extremely literate and concise.I hope this isn't the last book Tenet does. The man can write."
4,This was what I was looking for,"I was looking for a book that would introduce me to NT programming without going through the usual GUI garbage that has been handled by a thousand books (and which I frankly think should be programmed in VB, not C++).This book does just that.It is clearly written, covers topics such as thread synchronization, SEH, security, memory usage, NT services, event logging, consoles and more. I especially liked the chapter on NT services.So why only four stars instead of five?The last chapter on IPC and networking was conceptually good but poorly executed. I suspect that the publishing deadline drew near and the author ran out of time. Or perhaps the chapter was an afterthought, thrown in at the last minute, without much preparation or planning. The author makes no apologies for its quality, though he does make several references to other books which cover the topic, IPC and networking, better."
1,Not recommended.,"Even as a book for beginners, it doesn't really cover NT sufficiently. Many key issues are ignored; worse than that, the C++ code samples are buggy and some of them simply do not compile. If you're looking for a hands-on NT title, try ""Inside Windows NT"" by David A. Solomon (ISBN: 1572316772) instead."
3,Not good for learning the Win32 API...,"This book wasn't very good for what it said it would teach, the Win32 API. A big part of the Win32 API is Common Controls.. Which obviously it did not cover as all the programming examples are console (blech, Damn DOS to hell). Don't buy this book. At all. Ever. If you see a copy of it, actually.. you might want to buy it just so you can burn it. Rid the earth of such a horrid piece of literature. *shudder*jomama"
1,Don't waste your money,These were so thin and cheap. I ended up just taking them to a resale shop and got a few bucks. Use a quality trivet instead.
4,Birdy Nam Nam,"Amazing. A revolution in turntabalism. I have never heard such creativity. If your into this kind of music, I suggest buying this, I was very pleased."
5,Needs More Attention,"I don't have much to say that hasn't been said in the other 5 star reviews, but I felt that I should give this a 5 star rating in hopes of convincing more people to listen to Birdy Nam Nam. You'll be glad you did!"
4,Great text!,"This book is a great text book. My professor loves it and I really like it too. The way it makes you think is so different than other concepts in the math realm. This book makes you think and I recommed incorporating Sodoku puzzles into your curriculum if you teach a problem solving class. I'm only a student, but they really make you think."
4,Great word problems,I was looking for a collection of creative word problems to do with some advanced middle school students. This is a nice collection. Problems that are interesting to approach in many ways for many different levels.
5,Great book! Great price!,"I bought the book for a college class. It is a great book, and the price was great also (compared to the price of a used book at the book store at the university)."
1,"Daughter loves ponies, but leaves this in her pony bin.","This toy was very seriously not worth the money. My daughter, 4 1/2, got this and it's sister pony and simply can't play well with them. She begged me to take the rear skates off, which of course, you can't. She can't get the ponies into the bases by herself. The pony does nothing but stand there. The flickering crown kept her attention for all of 5 minutes.I was highly, highly disappointed with this toy. Even as a collector, I don't like it. I'm a ""touchy"" collector (Yes, I still play with the ponies! ack!) and they just are not fun. To boot, the one we got had a serious amount of glue in the hair toward the base of the neck, so it even makes her difficult to groom.Skip it."
5,A Great Western Story!,"Mr. Richards is a master of the genre. It's been quite a while since I've read a more riveting and well-crafted story of the Old West. The characters were so wonderfully and masterfully drawn, that the tale elicited a wide mix of emotions--even from the cold-blooded killers!The action was so vivid that I sometimes felt as though I could smell the acrid smoke and burning powder from Bobby Budd's belching .38.Thanks for a thoroughly enjoyable ride through old New Mexico and Arizona."
2,Almost 50% Identical To VB6 Unleashed,"I read this book cover to cover, (page 1 to 1091). It seems to ""jump all over the place"" in the way it progresses. Why does a chapter on SourceSafe come right before a chapter on Designing User Interfaces? That's nothing. Why is almost 50% of this book word for word VERBATIM to VB6 Unleashed? (Que and Sams have same parent company, Macmillan, that's why.) You want more? Why on page 884 is the variable name ""vtData"" when it is supposed to be ""MyData""? Because he copied this example word for word from the online help! He tried to be sneaky and change the names of the variables... except he missed one! Took me an hour to figure out why the code wasn't working. Thanks."
1,Dont buy it,This book is all over the place. I have no idea who it is for. I would consider myself and advanced beginner and in some places in the book i feel like an expert where he re explains things like how to make an access key 3 times but then tosses in this code that i havent seen before leaving behind no explanation. Most of the examples of code are 2-5 lines which are ripped from some program and displayed without giving any background context. I have no idea where he wanted to go with this book and I dont think he did either. The only reason I give it one star is because it has a nice cover and the table of contents makes it look helpful. Please do NOT waste your money on this. It would be more helpful to spend time on your own exploring VB than using this book...
2,"Um, like the review underneath is not by the author himself.","Sorry, this book is just about 50% identical to VB6 Unleashed. Ever heard of Copy and Paste?"
5,A Hard-Edge Mystery With A Supernatural Twist,"This has to be the best mystery that David Hunter has ever written. It's a hard-boiled who-done-it with a supernatural edge. It has everything--fast action, werewolves, and a plot that will keep you guessing until the very last page. I highly recommend this book, not only for those who like mysteries, but for those who enjoy police proceedurals as well."
3,"Good, but fatally flawed","This was a good book with a lot of useful information, but, like so many similar works, it was written under the assumption that the Bible is not the Word of God, that the prophets were not really prophets, and that Jesus was nothing more than a man, a product of his times. Guignebert was the victim of his own circular reasoning: ""Such and such book must have been written around the 4th century BC because it expresses ideas that evolved in Hebrew thought at that time...We know that these ideas evolved in Hebrew thought around the 4th century because such and such book, which was written at that time, illustrates the development of those ideas."" If you can read through his assumptions to find the solid facts, this is a valuable book. For an unbeliever he treated his subject with an extraordinary amount of respect."
2,Boosie's bout to blow,"I GAVE THIS ALBUM FIVE STARS BUT IT DIDN'T COME UP RIGHT. I'm from Baton Rouge, La so i've heard and supported every artist that's come out the south (except the fake ones), From Boosie to the Old Master P, to soulja slim and Mac. Even out to the the east with T.I., Pastor Troy and Youngbloodz. I've heard all types of Southern rap and even more New York Style, and i believe that Boosie can hang up there with all of them. Local or not, he knows how to make hot tracks and gives service to every gangsta beat that he's given. He's reppin hard for an overlooked city that's soon gonna be on the map, NATIONWIDE. With other up and coming stars such as C-Loc, Webbie, Maxmanelli, and Beelow, Boosie is bound to shine light on the abundance of undiscovered talent that lies in the capital of Louisana. RED STICK WHAT!!!! (Also check out my boy Down South on Limewire or Kazaa. He's from New Orleans but he's been in the Capitol City enough to hold it down for us)"
4,Ty Backyardigans review,"The set was great. After less than a month of my daughter playing with them, the seam on one of Tyrones' arm came loose exposing the filling. Contacted seller ""margiottalaw"" three times to see if they can send a replacement, but there wasn't a single reply to me request. Extremely disappointed with this seller."
4,My 3-year old loves them,"My 3-year-old loves these. Christmas morning, he bypassed many of his other toys to exclaim, ""I got ALL the Backyardigans!"" Nice set."
5,Ty Backyardigans set,My little grandaughter just loves these TV characters. They look just like the real ones on the show she watches even right down to their outfits. They are well made and worth every penny.
3,ok gift,My 3 yr old twins got the set of 5 for their birthday. Within 2 weeks though Tyrone had split his neck seam. Although the twins loved the dolls they played with them rarely so when the seam split I was really surprised. The dolls are a good size for small hands but need to be more sturdy.
4,Backyardians Ty Beanies,My granddaughter loves the beanies. She plays withthem daily. They are durable and I would recommend thistoy. It arrived in just a few days after ordering.Ty Pablo - Backyardigans
5,excelente,"I'm too happy with the purchase of stuffed bakcyardigans, are beautiful. more than perfect. the baby she loved me too, the shipping soon, maximum rating. thanks amazon."
4,This CD is a must for all those conscious listeners.,"This is suppose to be the greatest, however they left out some very irie tunes that could have replaced not so good ones. If you like reggae, and want wisdom and understanding of life, pick this one up."
5,The best ney recording!,"I don't know if this is the best, but this is a recording that just takes the top of my head off. The beautiful breathy tones of the ney seem to swirl around and around. There are pieces that are slow and almost seem to make time stop. The duets are subtle -the two neys seemlessly blending and complementing each other.I also enjoy the hypnotic and propulsive selections with the frame drum accompaniment. If you like quiet meditative music with great heart give this a listen."
4,"Informative, yet not essential [for me, at least]...","This is quite a good and informative biography, especially if you're interested, as I am, in the punk scene in Iceland in which she so flourished. There is much nice history here, though I feel that some of the interperatations of her actions and philosophy are a bit dodgy, and too opinionated. (not to mention the pronunciations! lol!) There are some nice, interesting, and charmingly witty(as always:) recordings of some of her actual quotes before each section.All in all, it's nice to have, but not necessarily essential for me."
4,Lots of good stuff!,Always that wonderful emotive voice along with superior pop songwriting that Tommy James did not always get credit for. I would recommend this for anyone that enjoys Tommy James and the Shondells!
1,P Star Rising,"Not what hip hop is about. hip hop is not about homeschooling and having your dad buy you recording studios. Reality makes great artists, not dads..."
3,If you can handle Metalllic KO...,Then you should have no problem with this. If you're a fan of the Dolls and the Stooges you need to have 'em both. So what if the sound quality stinks? The band plays great and the songs are good. It's too bad The NY Dolls never got to record these songs for real. They should have used these songs for the reunion record a few years ago rather than write terrible new ones.Check out Mighty High...In Drug City.
1,Not Helpful,The discripton tells you how much it weighs but not how big it it? plus it says VOLLEYBALL when it's a SOFTBALL? Seriously.So doesnt look like I'll be buying this...
2,Wiley needs a proofreader fantastically,"This was used as the textbook in a course in Linear RegressionAnalysis that I recently attended as an auditor. I'm a mathematician,not a statistician, so much of the material, and the authors' ways oflooking at it, were not familiar to me. My statistician colleaguesassure me that the techniques in the book are correct, useful, andmostly up to date. And I believe them.Alas, the book is poorly edited, and in just the few chapters wecovered, I found a score of errors, including misstated formulas,misplaced graphics, multiplication where there should be division, andeven some numerical errors. If you, as an instructor, decide to adoptthis book for your course, be prepared to do a lot of proofreading(the publisher apparently didn't bother) and to distribute textbookcorrections to your students. Also note that this book, like so manyWiley textbooks, is overpriced."
2,Frustrated,"Firstly, I am not stats guru, a mere mortal trying to get through a top-10 MBA program. I picked this book (and the companion text) to extend my knowledge, and it is helping. Tough for the gifted amateur, but interesting and the depth of the analysis truly helps.Major negative comment : The manual often provides one sentence answers to mathematical questions. For example : ""....slight improvement in the model."" But this is not helpful. It lacks truly worked answers to the questions; which is essential to help those who are struggling to get to the right level.This is not a limited observation, it is the trend and considerably more work could be done to explain how answers were derived, as it also helps find out why an answer might not be correct.As for the up side. All chapter questions are answered and the FTP site provides raw data files. This is greatly appreciated. In balance, the weaknesses are significant."
2,It is a book for computation,"I respect those who wrote this book and understand this book and enjoy this book but it is another example how far between the academia and industry/life. It is book with a lot of computation which in today's industry could be handled by statistical software like SAS or SPSS. For those who have shaky background in Math like me (and I think I am better than average America), this book is a pain in the neck. What I really want to learn is not how to compute but how to interpret. This book should be renamed as Linear Regression Computation with Paper and Pencil."
1,Wrong purchase,"I blamed myself for this wrong purchase, and hope you can avoid it. This is a book of solution for questions asked in Linear Regression Analysis, not the book. This is a collection of answers."
2,Contrived but good potential,"Debut novels are often a bit awkward, but Stephen has a good mind for plot and an interesting background in computers. The biggest problems with the book are details that aren't needed to move the plot forward, strange repetitions (tall athletic man,) a criminal boss who doesn't really seem in charge, and illogical descriptions of a would-be murderer jumping up and down in frustration, and expressions like; ""Wait,"" he yelled to himself, and, ""What do you think so far?"" she screamed over the loud music and screaming girls.With an experienced critic wielding a red pen, I believe the essence of the book could have been covered in 235 pages and been made much stronger. All that being said, Stephen should analyze his first work, learn from revising it, and write again soon."
4,READ THIS NEW AUTHOR!,"The further you get into the plot, the better this novel becomes!Pick up a copy. It will keep you guessing."
5,Assassins Game will keep you plunging ahead,"Nerdy but cute graduate student cracks a code and then is pursued by a lovely young lady. Coincidence? We think not! Add serveral near death experiences and even the most blase will be suspicious. The hero of this well-thought-out story is smart, clever and just quirky enough to be believable. You will find yourself having to read ""just a few more pages"" even though you are too tired to keep your eyes open, this book is a real page-turner. I don't want this to be a spoiler, so I can't go any further in my plot description (but don't trust the girl), but let it suffice to say that you will find this book exciting and entertaining! A rip-roaring read!"
1,This is not what is on Kill Bill vol 1,"I got this because I really enjoyed 'Battle without honor or humanity' on the Kill Bill (vol 1) soundtrack, and I wanted to hear more of his work. A number of the songs on this album have intersting guitar work thats burried under and mixed with really really bad pop. I couldn't find even on redeeming song on this CD. So if you want more from him that sounds like 'Battle...' get something else."
1,Not So Greatest,"Fans of Hotei's song on the Kill Bill Vol. 1 soundtrack will be severely disappointed by this collection of jaw-droppingly mediocre pop songs. There is no real guitar work of note, and what little stands out isn't that impressive. The pop songs are to pop what Barry Manilow is to standards...they make all the right sounds, but you've heard it before, and likely turned it off. As an afficiando of guitar instrumentalists, my advice is to back away from this one."
5,best guide,I like this guide very much. It tells you everything you need to know and it is not like the other cheap ones you get at the store. You should order this book because it guides you through the game and tells you how to get the good monsters by breeding.nOne last reason why i liked it is because it gives a whole list of every single monster in the game. Order now and you wont be whasting your money.
5,what it does,"It tells you what monster you get when you breed monsters,where to go,what monsters look like,there stats,and gets you started."
4,Fast Paced Easy To Read Thriller,"Not a bad book to pass the time away with. The story of a man, Willie Hanson, running away from family, lovers and a successful career as a publishing house president. There's many reasons why Willie is running, the main one being a U.S. Senator with a taste for orgy parties and drugs. As the story snakes through its many twists and turns you attach yourself to Willie with the hope that he'll come out of the chase alive and redeemed.The fast-paced writing and short chapters gives this thriller more punch than it truly packs. I feel the author may have left much out so as not to bog down the flow of this thriller. Or maybe he saved it for what looks like could be a continuing sequel. Either way this book worked for me and was a joy to read."
5,A Culture of Respect,"Societal changes have consequences, and how a people choose to raise their children reveals much about their values and spirit of place. Andean children (though living with material scarcity) are fully entwined in a network of reciprocal obligations, thereby discovering the meaning of being human. It is this culture of respect that Inge Bolin reveals in this splendid and original book.Wade Davis - Explorer-in-Residence, National Geographic Society"
3,Missing print on several pages...,"I would most likely give this book a better rating but my copy has several pages where the print and photos do are not visible.On another note having lived in the highlands of Peru even to this day I have learned many things from the Andean people and their values. There are several differences from area to area. I work directly with the Quechua speaking population. There are some dramatic changes going on now due to governmental influences or lack there of. One of them in particular is the movement of children to the city to get a ""better education"". This has caused some stress on the families as they are separated from their children for periods of time.I have both books, Rituals of Respect and Growing up in a Culture of Respect.There remains much to be learned from the Andean people.I currently live near the area of the Cordillera Blanca of the Andes."
5,GR8 Coffee Table book!,"The pictures are wonderful! Both for kids & adults! Made me laugh, made me cry. Very enjoyable! Sent this one as a gift to a Golden owner & dear friend!"
3,Calling All Golden Lovers,"If you like Goldens, this is a funny addition. Personally, my favorite small book about dogs is ""The Dog Gospels,"" as it is just a little more clever (and less graphic in some instances) than 101 Uses for a Golden Retriever."
2,Good things DO NOT come in small packages,"I was very disapointed in the book. Although the book contains many quality pictures, the actual size of the book was very disapointing. The book measures approximately 6"" X 6"" in total size, not what I was expecting."
5,Happy for what I paid,"Ok so everyone here complaint about being plastic, yeah they r but honestly for the price and the quality plastic it is, I think is worth it, I change all my boots on my Sentra SE R and it was a perfect fit."
2,Disapppointed,"I got the strut bumper I wanted, but the boot is very short and plastic, not rubber or silicone. I used the original boot as it seemed much better than the KYB replacement."
2,Plastic Not Rubber Boot,"Not very impressed by the rather light and flimsy plastic the bellows is made of. As it turns out the old original rubber bellows I took off was in pretty good shape. So as I was concerned about the longevity of the plastic bellows, I decided not to use it and rather keep it as a spare in case the original bellows is ever damaged by rocks or other flying object."
4,Nicely done. Well Organized.,"Comprehensive and useful book for mastering great phrases and sayings. I appreciated the characters being written in the back and the GREAT indexing (both English and Chinese). It would have been nice to have tone marks over the Pinyin, but the characters make up for it."
2,It is not a easy to use dictionary.,"This book comprises of proverbs and vernaculars. Some phrases are regional. The proverbs were organized based on their Mandarin Pin-yin pronounciation. However, for those who do not know Chinese writing or pin-yin, this book is not quite helpful if you just want to understand Chinese proverbs. However, if you know Chinese and Mandarin pin-yin, you will find this book somewhat helpful. Also, the English index helps.As for me, who know how to read some Chinese (and do not know pin-yin), but would like to know the definitions of some proverbs, I find it difficult to look through the Chinese characters written in the back in order to find a proverb. Therefore, if the characters were typed and organized by strokes, that would be more helpful."
2,Yet another book of proverbs,Disappointingly banal. This book reads as if it were written by a chinese-speaking lawyer. Verdict: don't waste your money.
2,Very Disappointing,"I'm a great admirer of Bacon's work. That being said, this DVD sucked! There is no actual video footage, rather they show a poorly produced slide show that was probably done using PowerPoint. The fact that there is no video is made even more unbearable by the poor quality of the images shown. The two redeeming qualities of this video are the detailed commentary and the sheer number of images. Don't waste your time or money...if you have to, rent it."
5,An insight into American Politics,"A well done insight into the American political system. Fair and balanced, it takes us through one of the key states in the last election. Interesting interviews with politicians from both sides add to an understanding of what happened in Ohio in 2004. Well worth the time to see this interesting documentary."
5,great album'',love the album' great songs. if your a new dwight fan than you should get this album its a great way to get into dwight yoakam. if your already of fan of his. and dont have this album than get it you'll be glad you did. i know i was.
2,Wow,"I Think this movie was very well made. I am a younger viewer and have just gotten interested in war movies. This is one of the best I've seen. You really got to know what the characters were feeling and you got to see all sides. There was the point of view of the soilders, the enemy, the wives, and there is even a seen with the enimies wife. At times it was very intense and other times you felt really bad for the characters. The movie made a real impact. When we left the theater nobody was talking it was silent."
1,We were soldiers,This film will change your lifeif you watch it through to the end I chalenge you not to crythis film shows the true horror of war and does not like otherfilms show a funny side with a glossy hero that for some reason wont get killed dispite the odds. based on true events we were soldiers will teach you to respect the armed forces and remember the tragedy of the vietnam war.
1,Can't find my previous review,"I can't find my review that's being sarcastic about the heroic attempt of this movie in illustrating heroic Americans. I'm very dissapointed if my post was simply deleted. I appreciate the comment a reviewer left behind my post. I tried to come back and read it again. But my post was gone, so did the comment. A shame."
1,Worst of all Viet Nam movies!,"Having ""been there, done that"" I thought this movie did a very poor job of recreating the Viet Nam conflict. Don't waste your time or money!"
5,Just a few clarifications,"I went here to read the reviews of a movie I haven't seen...but I HAVE read the book.In it family members clearly say that they recieved the death notices via telegrams delivered by Taxi Cab drivers (this was before the military started sending Chaplins and live people to deliver the news) and also that news of fatalities were delivered to family members on November 14th (Tom Metzger's wife knows the moment she got the news, of course...)the day the battle started. So...those were true things I guess in the movie.PS- I gave the movie the five starts because I had to give a rating to post this on the site."
5,Impressive!,"I could have done without the two racism lessons, it's getting pretty tiring now. I suppose it's due to the era this film was based and I accept it for that, but they seemed really out of place to me.Other than that the movie was excellent. The action was intense and I could feel the tension really build as the movie progressed.This movie showed very intense action for only a few days of time that went by and really impressed upon me the hell that many of the soldiers and pilots in Vietnam had to endure on a daily basis as they fought against Communism throughout their enlistment.In all I will never forget the movie and the feelings it stirred within me. I highly recommend seeing it!"
4,"If you like a story about heart, courage and history","Good movie. If you like action, a good story line and enjoy seeing someone beat the odds, this is for you. The movie is about war but there's limited graphic gore. It has a great story line that shows just how tough war is on everyone.Enjoy."
4,Wow,"The best Vietnam war film I've seen. Deals with the first American engagement with the Vietnamese. This movie just never stops after getting to Vietnam.Gives people a whole new respect for the soldiers who laid it on the line for their country. No politics, no social statement, just American Heroes fighting an enemy with honor and bravery. Sam Elliot was fantastic and Mel Gibson was a pleasant surprise.Bravo! At last a movie that shows the vietnam war vets as the heros they were."
4,Good book as a gift for a diabetic,I haven't read this book (hence the 4 star rating) but really bought it as a gift for a diabetic friend. My friend told me that it was very good and that the information was very helpful. His wife told my wife that she also wanted to read it but could not get a chance to since her husband was always referring to it.
5,Mel Gibson shines,"This is one of my favorite VietNam movies. I like it better than Apocalypse Now and Platoon. I know that is blasphemy, but it's the truth. Mel Gibson is brilliant in this movie and I highly recommend this to everyone."
5,Hal Moore... a man all men should be compared to,"Being one for whom the Viet Nam War was 'my' war, and this 1965 action was the first major battle for our boys, I could not help buying it and watching it often. The brides of the courageous men are well depicted here, and Mel does a wonderful job playing Hal Moore....one of our Country's true leaders..."
4,This movie is ok and worth a view.,"Mel Gibson might be a little strange, but he does work hard at his movies and with that said this movie is worth your time and I thank you will enjoy it."
4,A must have war movie,The best depiction of war I have seen since Saving Private Ryan. A must have for all historian and war buffs.
4,Perfectly captured small moments.,"This is one occasion, where your initial experience is expanded and improved by a simple little behind-the-scenes info. I saw the movie, and though it was a well-done, but standard war flick.Then I saw the short featurette, and replayed the movie in my head.The ""you are there"" quality of the gunplay attracts the most attention, but the little moments, like the taxi delivering the telegrams, are the ones that'll haunt you.The cast is as good as you'd expect, but again, this movie is made in the details, not in the plot or the dialogue. In that respect, it's made exceedingly well."
4,Good war movie,"Here it's another good war movie and if you love the team made Braveheart, you should see this."
2,"Mel, You Had Great Material- what happened?","Granted, this is a movie, and designed for entertainment, but the subject matter demanded better treatment for the honored dead- of both sides. The book this movie was based on was one of the finest Vietnam histories I've ever had the pleasure and honor to read. So it was with great eagerness that I awaited this film. Mel had access to the book's author,Lt. Gen.Harold G. Moore, as well as all available historical reference materials.So it was with deep regret that I saw Gibson take HUGE liberties with historical facts that were painted onto history's pages with the blood of those brave men. The performances were great; I've always been a Sam Elliot fan; but this doesn't excuse the end result.Do yourself a favor- read the book ""We Were Soldiers Once And Young"" if you want to truly capture the feel, as well as the facts of that battle. This is why I coud only give two stars as my rating."
4,Get this if only for the music,"The movie was a bit PC in the end (and I believe not faithful to the book in that regard) but the dedication of the troops and the confusion of war are well shown. And as an added bene, the music is among the best sound track music I've heard in terms of inspirational and uplifting."
3,A disapointment to the book,"I read the book for my ROTC class. I found the movie to be utterly disapointing. I hope that if you like the movie, you will like the book, as it explains the story of these soldiers in an accurate and dare I say honorable fashion.After watching the movie I felt nothing. But after reading the book, I was moved by their story.The acting was very medicore.They should have never put those wives in the movie either."
5,We Will Never Forget,"It highlights the spirit of America, now more important than ever we can see the sacrifices given for the good of one nation."
5,We were soldiers,The purchase of this movie was a much better experience and the movie was to replace an already had one but a VCR and it is an awesome movie depicting more realism than any other Vietnam movie i have seen.
5,We Were Soldiers,"Saw this movie not long after it was produced. There was great leadership, and he had the perfect role. Wanted a copy. Now I got it. Great movie!!"
5,We Were Soldiers,"I would suggest this movie to anyone. Not only was it a great story, but an actual account of what happen in that war."
5,MOVIE WAS GREAT BUT THE BOOK WAS EVEN BETTER.,"THE MOVIE WAS VERY VERY GOOD. BUT IN A MOVIE YOU GET THE ABREVIATED VERSION.BECAUSE THIS FIRE FIGHT REALLY HAPPENED I BELIEVE THE AMERICANPEOPLE SHOULD ALSO READ THE BOOK TO UNDERSTAND THE MOVIE TO ITSFULLEST. THIS ACTION WAS A CRUCIAL POINT IN AMERICAN INVOLVEMENTIN VIETNAM. IT ALSO DECIDED OUR CONTINUED INVOLVEMENT VIETNAM,WITH THE ITS ESCALATION OF OUR SOLDIERS IN THE WAR."
5,Excellent movie,I show this to my US History class during the Vietnam unit. It shows all sides of how the conflict affected all involved.
5,Vietnam without the cynical viewpoint,"The main thing that sticks with me after watching this excellent depiction of the early days of the Vietnam War is towards the end of the movie (after the battle) when the press helicopter lands and all the reporters gather around Gibson and the other soldiers and start asking inane questions. It just seemed so jarring and surreal. I mean what the hell do you even say after an experience like that. I kept thinking, in regards to the reporters, that they so couldn't even understand ... and I was only watching the battle (in the comfort of my living room), not fighting in it!!That's realistic moviemaking when I as a viewer felt like I was part of the experience."
2,What happens when...people try to be meaningful.,"Mel Gibson and company are soldiers surrounded by overwhelming odds in the Ia Drang Valley during the Vietnam War. Graphically violent film features almost non-stop fighting after the first hour. Technically, the battle scenes are well-choregoraphed, but those sequences never achieve the ""you are there"" feeling, and the film completely lacks in genuine dramatic power and nail-biting intensity. The character development is second-rate, the symbolism is heavy-handed...This is what happens when...people try to meditate on the meaning of brotherhood. Good message, but poorly executed. This has nothing on Saving Private Ryan or Black Hawk Down."
3,Decent.,"The acting is great, the casting (minus Chris Klein) was decent, and the story was interesting. The whole movie is definetly worth watching. Sam Elliott's parts were small, but memorable.There were only two downfalls. The first is the switching of scenes to the women at home, it distracted from the rest of the story. The second is a lot more of a problem. During the climactic battle scene, I have one question. How is it that nobody heard the choppers? Bell helicopter's are very loud. I mean very loud. I'm talking being able to hear it miles away, let alone right on top of them. I realize in some movies, we're supposed to suspend disbelief ... to a point. But I just didn't buy this one. Maybe it's just me."
4,Good War Movie,"We Were Soldiers is a movie about the Vietnam Conflict that shows the first major engagement between US soldiers and the North Vietnamese Regulars. The movie does an excellent job potraying the events of the first skirmish of the Ia Drang battle in 1965. There are a few shortfalls though. I have never been to Vietnam, or seen the real Ia Drang Valley, but Vietnam portrayed in this movie looks like California to me. I was also dismayed at the Hollywood style ending of the movie. I beleive that the screenwriter, who also happens to be the director, should have stayed true to the book. The entire Battle of Ia Drang was over 35 days, whereas the movie only shows us the first three days. Thus, the viewer gets a falsified sense of victory out of the movie. Consequently, the movie is a good war movie; I would put it in my top 5 favorite war movies."
3,Adequate,"The start of the film tries way too hard and is not very interesting. The very poor music does not help. Cliches abound. The movie does build well, particularly through the battle sequences. It is, overall, simply adequate...although far better than the film disaster Patriot."
1,totally not satisfied!,I ordered for my brother-in-law for Christmas present and just wanted to add to his collection of movies and this is the first time I got a unusable movie. Kept stopping all through the movie.
5,oh my goodness!,"I thought that this was an awesome movie! I laughed, I almost cried. I LOVE Mel Gibson though so I'm automatically predjudiced!!!!!Watch this movie!!!~Sarah"
2,"Poorly made, visually obscene film","I love a good, well-made war movie (i.e. Saving Private Ryan, Full Metal Jacket, Hamburger Hill etc.), but this film is a complete failure. Not only are the characters poorly developed and the script lacking in credibility but the combat scenes are reminiscent of those badly filmed war movies of the 1950s and 60s. Though this film might be historically accurate, its visually absurd at times, with the Vietnamese troops blindly running into torrents of fire, often in single file. Ridiculous. Frankly, its insulting. There are far better films than this to spend your money on. This one falls flat."
1,Sorry Depiction of war,Seeing this movie in the theater I walked on being so disgusted at the poor portrayal of Vietnam. Overglorified battles when actual combat in Vietnam were chaotic skirmishes... it looked like a civil war battle with all the Vietnamese charging blindly and falling by the dozens... riiiight. There is a laughable scene where Mel spins around and miraculously shoots a Vietnamese character when he comes a little too close to the group of American officers. This is one of the few movies which I have walked out on.
2,We Were Soldiers that don't Like Plots,"I have to admit, We Were Soldiers was an okay movie. Melly was good. Special Effects were good. Horror was good. But the plot was terrible.The story follows the recently formed Air Cav into a battle. Bang bang, ""we're all going to die"" ""Nooooo"" Bang bang-the end. Yes, that's right, this movie was gunshots the whole way through. No plot whatsoever. Doesn't show any other aspect/atmosphere of Vietnam than a big battle. Some cool scenes, but overall the shooting gets boring real quick.WATCH PATH TO WAR INSTEAD!!!!! IT WASN'T ALL MACNAMERA'S FAULT!!!"
1,This movie packs a wallop... sort of.,this movie is awesome! its my favorite! its so undescribably cool! i know youll love it so just buy it!!! nO!O!O!O!O!O!O!O!O!O!O!O!O!O!O! buy like 15. youll need 15 because youll wear out the other 14 from watching them like a billion trillion like fahsjlbgsillion times!!!!!!!!!!! woowowowowowowowaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh. thats like how cool it is. .. . . . . . . ... .. .. . . .. . .
2,"Wallace made his best, but....","I read the book before seeing the movie. IT was not a dissapointment, no, it's a good movie, but something's weird here...In the book, Moore traces a brief background about the Vietnam situation (French dominance, American involvment, the politics of it all). In the movie, it is seldom mentioned. Also, half the book is about another battle fought two days later, at Landing Zone Albany, where American soldiers suffered even bigger losses than in Landing zone X-Ray.Also, I'm positive that, in the book, Moore does not talk about himself killing anyone. The movie shows him killing a lot of vitnamese soldiers, some of them at point blank range... I understand that, since, the second battler would be completely wiped out for the movie, Wallace had to make Moore (Gibson) more dominant on the screen.Just a note: what's wrong with Madeleine Stowe's mouth here? Have someone noticed that? There's something werong with her lips!"
5,"Excellent, you must see it to believe it","The title should be : How to survive when you are 400 inexperienced U.S. soldiers surrounded by 2000 North Vietnamese Army soldiers? The answer is simple : stay together, fight to death and hope that you will received air support and ammunitions because you are stuck in a very bad place. This movie shows the difficulties of a war for the soldeirs when you are merely in a hand to hand fight. After this movie, I am sure that you will not wish to go to war in a place like that. Excellent movie"
5,A true account of an atrocity from which we may not recover.,"This realistic movie depicts the start of the Viet Nam war in human misery and bravery. As he did so well in THE PATRIOT, Mel Gibson performs marvelously as the American general (granted, he was no MacArthur, but who else was?) and gives an award-winning, heart-rending, authentic acting performance so sincere that his tears cause the moveiegoer to respond in kind.He may be from down under, but he makes a pretty good Southern gentleman turned soldier. There were a few funny incidents as when the women's group talk about going to the laundry in that small Georgia town.It breaks your heart when you see that yellow taxi's appearance; I almost had a heart attack when the general's wife looked out and saw it that last time.Don't miss this powerful movie; it will leave you with fulfillment and the knowledge we were denied when this event actually took place. More power to the Viet Nam vets!"
4,Still Great,"The Vietnam-era movies are fairly hit and miss, but this movie is the former IMO. I couldn't say how much of this story is historically accurate but the action was decent and Sam Elliot is the man! I wasn't impressed with many of the actors, or parts of the score, but overall it was an enjoyable war movie that delivered on most counts."
4,Real War,"For the most realistic images of what war is like, this is the film to buy. Given that it is based upon real events and real people,with no Holywood hype or exageration, it is totally believeable. The effects on families 'back home' are also amongst the most poignant ever filmed. I defy anyone to watch it without getting a lump in their throat."
4,hard core battle and action,I saw this movie last night and the movie was spectacular. The second half is action all the way through and very very entertaining. It stars mel gibson as leader of forces during the vietnam war. If you like action check this movie out. Rated R for intense brutal and very graphic war violence and some language.
5,Brilliant,A wonderful movie showing not only the raw emotion on the frontline. But what happened to the wives and families of the soldiers. And what there hell was like. Everyone after seeing this movie should appreciate an American Soldier more and ask forgiveness of a vistnam vet for the way our country treated them during that time.
5,Randall Wallace...,"...has created a cinematic masterpiece. In two hours plus he has accomplished a screen play that will glue you to your seat, make it hard at times to breath and make a cough seem irreverent. I am a 5th US Cavalry veteran serving in Vietnam and Cambodia as a rifleman. For a veteran this movie is too painful, for all others it should be required viewing, maybe even mandatory high school curriculum. To finish the movie the hymn written by Randall Wallace and performed by the West Point Glee Club, ""The Mansions of the Lord"" will destroy what is left of your soul. The song, I can assure you will be a standard at West Point for the next 1000 years. I can honestly say, when all is said and done, that Randall Wallace has quite possibly done as much or more for Vietnam veterans with this movie as the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Thank you sir from a grateful Vietnam veteran."
4,Fair to middlin',"war movie, starring Mel Gibson and Sam Elliott as a pair of Air Cav bosses who successfully rattle up a much larger Vietnamese force in the early stages of the war. Occasionally trad, naive and cliche, but very moving film that reminds us of the home front battles that soldier families must endure, and that we didn't always lose in that fateful war. I haven't read the book yet, and now virtually nothing about Col. Moore or Ia Drang, so I'll avoid the military criticism, and say overall it was enjoyable and you won't feel the two and a half hours go by."
4,A good movie about War,"If you want to see a movie, with a lot of blood and real bad situation...just see saving private ryan, this movie ""we were soldiers"" is good, I respect Mel gibson, but im really tired to see him in the same kind of movie...In this movie the main plot is about the soldiers and their families, the only problem i found in this movie is the lack of action........yes...here you can see a lot of deads and things like that.....but not at the same POWER like you see in other war movies...but it's still good..."
5,Right on,"I am a Vietnam vet and have been very disappointed by most movies that were made about this conflict. This movie shows us the bravery, fear, and brutality of this war. It also helps us understand why not all vets want to remember their experiences during their time there. Excellent movie and very realistic."
5,A Moving true saga of the American soldier,"As a veteran who served in the military for 35 years as well as a military history buff, I found this DVD to be the best that I have yet seen on the Vietnam War.A wonderful moving account of the men who had to fight on the ground with little understanding of the situation by the brass behind the desks. I think that this movie should be required viewing on leadership principles in the military, much as ""12 O'Clock High"" was some 20 years ago.A terrific movie... and splendid acting by Mel Gibson."
2,disoppointing,"This is SUCH a disoppointment!! After two great movies like Braveheart and especially the Patriot, you would expect an even better one from Mel Gibson. But this one didn't even make me want to see the end. Though it's not THAT bad, it's a disoppointment."
1,It came scratched!!,"Although this movie was a great price, my dad opened the brand new movie on christmas to watch it and it was already scratched, and we couldn't watch part of the movie."
1,OverRated,"The movie did not develop any characters beyond the normal sappy sterotypes of soldiers. The first half is a romanticized view of soldiers (and their families) lives. Once they go to war, the second half, the movie picks up steam. However, the war scenes were without a clear purpose and not really part of the story. Bottom line, it could have been shorter and much better if the characters had been developed before the war."
1,By the DVD.,"The movie is great, but the HD copy has no better resolution than the DVD. I played them one after another on the same scene and there was no deference between the two. Basically, you pay for high definition and get a DVD. Disappointing."
3,"""heroes""","""American Heroes"" ... guess that sums it up. this movie tries to celebrate the blood spilled in this pointless struggle. I see the war as a wound we refused to let close. How many NVA soldiers died horrible, slow, bloody painful deaths? How many of them had families? In this film, they mostly all die offscreen. When they're on screen, they usually perish while jumping from a huge explosion. The Vietnamese commander is about as distant and trivial as possible. More time is spent trying to establish an emotional connection with the CO's Wife. What? And that's where this movie goes wrong. It conveys chaos, maybe, but not fear. The Thin Red Line, despite it's long running time (similar to this film) is much more effective in letting the audience develop a connection with the main characters and in showing why they act. We Were Soldiers simply shows men getting slaughtered and trying to remain patriotic/hopeful until the end of the flick. and what a TERRIBLE score."
5,We Were Soldiers,"Excellent, Excellent movie! My favorite Mel Gibson movie next to Braveheart. This is now my favorite Vietnam movie along with The Siege of Firebase Gloria [only available on vhs] and Hamburger Hill. This movie kept me on the edge of my seat and a lump in my throat for most of the film. Can't recommend this highly enough. Much better than Black Hawk Down or Behind Enemy Lines."
3,Well Rounded Look At Vietnam,"We Were Soldiers, unlike a lot of movies about Vietnam or even other wars, succeeds at bringing you the story of the soldiers without being mired in the preachiness of the ills of war. My one complaint about Black Hawk Down is that you never really get to know the soldiers so when calamity strikes you don't really get it. We Were Soldiers makes them real, and the inclusion of the experiences of those on the homefront is a great move. It's one thing when a soldier dies on the battlefield, a whole other when his wife receives word at home. I also give kudos to We Were Soldiers for realizing that the enemy on the other side (in this case the Viet Cong) weren't just a faceless monolith of asian menace but instead had families and lives back home they felt they were fighting for. The inclusion of this makes other Vietnam-era movies seem a lot less well rounded in comparison."
5,A Great War Movie,"My brother actually fought in the war, and said this movie's depiction was pretty accurate. I actually don't think it depicts Americans as cicilized and galliant like some other people have said, it just shows that they had better technology. This is probablly one of the best Vietnam war movies, arughbly second only too Platoon. It is spot on to the book it was based on too. All and all it was a realistic great war movie!"
2,"Finally, a movie that fogs the Vietnam War","I will admit right now, I am no fan of Mel. He is very talented as an actor and film maker; there is no doubt about that. But I think he's always had an extreme Christian-right leaning agenda that he managed to keep somewhat hidden for decades, and in this film, his veil of secrecy is clearly removed. Forget about the whys and morals of that particular war, he indicates. You get from Gibson that the real point is that war is bloody hell and we may as well win while we're at it, and we have plenty of practice with it. And to hell with all those peace loving naysayers. So in effect, his film throws our society back another 30 years. Stick with the real Vietnam films like MASH, Apocalypse Now, Deer Hunter, and Full Metal Jacket. Even Hamburger Hill made more sense than this piece of junk."
1,Truckload of simplistic cliches,Utterly unrealistic glorification of war. I happen to know a few real soldiers who fought on the other side. The war was much more brutal and savage and americans were much less civilised and gallant.
2,An OK Movie,"They compare this movie a lot to Braveheart because it was written by the same guy and stars Mel Gibson. Well, in my opinion this movie was no where near close to Braveheart.Mel Gibson's acting is decent but I dont' think he'll ever do better than Braveheart. The Patriot was better than this movie if you want another Mel Gibson war movie.If you want another war movie from the 20th century, check out Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brothers. Also, Platoon kicks this movie's butt as far as Vietnam movies go.Overall this movie was too drawn out. The action was great, was very random and long. The beginning seemed like it took forever. I got really sick of Mel Gibson talking about God and never leaving his soldiers. It just seemed cheesy and out of place.There are better war movies out there, so try something else. If you want some pretty decent action and blood and guts and gore, check this one out. I suggest renting it though."
2,Unrealistic and annoying - one slow motion kill after another,There are hundreds (at least it seems that way) of deaths shown in slow motion. It gets really annoying. Ruins what could have been a good movie.
1,Simplistic and poor quality,"It seemed like a whitewashed film from the 40s in many ways. The acting was mediocre and Mel was not at his best or second best or third best. A flat film with lousy camera action. I am surprised at all of the 5 ratings,"
5,awesome movie!!!,"this is by far one of the best movies i've seen, not just dealing with the Viet Nam war, but with war in general. the acting is superb, and the storyline is beautifully written. i have seen it more times than i can count and it makes me cry every time. kudos to mel gibson and his terrific cast of fellow actors. they can and should be proud of the work they did on this film."
5,Real Heros,I had the privilage to meet the wife of Lt. Col. Frank Vaverk. He was a member of the 7th Cav. and was in the battle shown in the movie and was friends with several officers there. I have the deepest respect for soldiers that are brave and devoted to duty. They are the reason we enjoy freedom. God Bless them and keep them safe. I must say the movie brought me to tears because it was so realistic. Thanks Joseph
5,Amazing movie and book,"This movie is action packed and emotionally charged. This is a great film from start to finish and Mel Gibson was absolutely amazing. You get drawn into this film from the beginning and you start to understand what our Vietnam veterans went through over there. This film is specifically focusing on the first battle between the US military and the North Vietnamese soldiers. It was a brutal battle. If you liked the movie, I would highly recommend buying the book... and vice versa. Again, I absolutely love this book. It is one of my favorites. I think I've seen it over a dozen times. A must buy."
5,A Great Film Demonstrating Enormous Resolve of Our Troops,"This film is very intense, realistic and superbly shot. The production values are incredible. As a slice of life from the Vietnam era, the film captures the esprit de corps of the troops, the strength of the soldier's wives as well as the challenge of a new era in warfare. Mel Gibson is excellent. His sargeant, Sam Elliott, was a superb characterization of a tough sargeant who went through all three major parachute jumps in World War II. He is a no nonsense warrior.All the more powerful is the portrayal of Gibson's faith in light of duty, courage and devotion to his men. Greg Kinnear did an excellent job as a challenged pilot creating a new Air-Cav warfare in the early days of Vietnam. His copilot ""Too Tall"" received the Congressional Medal of Honor decades ago. Kinnear's character finally received his CMH in the last year - long overdue.Powerful. Memorable. Realistic."
4,Movie worth having,"This a great, thought provoking, inspiring movie. It is graphic at times but it is portraying true events. It's one that goes in my movie library."
5,"DVD Quality Fine, Great Price, Great Service","DVD quality is fine (no halts, no skips). Great price, Quick Service. All you'd want from this vendor in the Amazon family"
4,Where is the hit LYTE AS A ROCK!?,"Pop this one in the cd player/tape deck, sit back, and reminisce. I've been an MC Lyte fan since day one so this was a 'must buy' for me. This album definitely covers most of the hits (and most of my favs) from way back in '88 (""10% Dis"" and ""Paper Thin"", to name a few) on up to '96 (""Cold Rock a Party"" with Missy Elliot). However I am a little disappointed that ""Lyte as a Rock"" (title track from her first album) is not a song on the album. That had to be at least one of the songs/videos that put most people on to MC Lyte. (Yeah, maybe they could have added as a bonus track Positive K and MC Lyte's ""Excuse Me Miss"") If you don't already own all of the albums, or even if you do, add this to your cd collection. This is a must have from one of the hottest female rap artists from back in the day."
5,Return to Simpler Days,"This cd takes me back to a time when I did not have bills to pay or a job to go to: I had the job of growing up. MC Lyte was what I wanted to be. I wanted to make my own way and have lots of money, and live in STYLE. This takes me back and makes me happy that I do not have too many regrets. She was a strong role model who did not rely on prissy primping. . .she was herself. Thanks for letting me go back."
5,The 1st Female to ......,"She was the 1st female to put the fear of God. I could've sworn a man wrote her lyrics. ""Lyte as a Rock""? my goodness no woman has ever clinched the game like she did. NO ONE male/female in the game dissed her. You couldn't, your career would've ended the moment you take your 1st breathe. Paper thin? after listening to that, sooperman luver need to get vest out the dry cleaner to step to this. Lot of memories, ie doorknockers, and that blonde puff hair style. Salute to lyte!"
5,Finally!,"It's about time that Lyte had a Greatest Hits CD out! Her decade-plus list of tunes are ear-candy, but there are a couple crucial ones missing. ""Lyte As A Rock"", for instance, was one of her first singles and videos that made waves. Also, ""I'm Not Havin' It"" with Positive K isn't included along with ""I Go On"" & ""Everyday"". It's kinda frustrating not to see all her gems in full effect here, but at least the majority of 'em are included. Kudos to Lyte & props for a great career! Much Love"
3,prints and poisons,"A college dorm especially for single parents and their children - an intriguing concept. And it seems to work until someone starts poisoning some of the single moms. Maggie, of course, as advisor to the house, becomes embroiled at the center of the tragedy. Besides doing her utmost to identify the killer, Maggie attempts to work her way thru several personal dilemmas. Should she have a child? Should she get married first, or will her experiences at the dorm give her the courage to become a single mom herself? What about her relationship with Will, which doesn't seem to meet many of her emotional needs?None of these dilemmas is solved in Shadows/Ivy, but the killer is found and 2 mothers and daughters reunited. ""Cozies"" tend to lack suspense, and this is no exception. Otherwise, it's an OK mystery story."
3,A solid academic mystery,"Like a Jane Langton mystery, this book is an intellectual's mystery, packed with facts regarding Currier & Ives prints, nineteenth century depictions of African-Americans, and miscellaneous background on a variety of artists and lithographs. However, with the exception of one classroom scenario, author Lea Watt manages to blend seamlessly historical information and mystery. A classic whodunit, complete with multiple motives and false trails. Maggie Summer is a conflicted and interesting protagonist-sleuth, who I look forward getting to know better in the other books in the series."
2,A dud so soon?,"The car charger has stopped working, less than 2 years after I puchased this kit. Now I'll have to buy another. What a waste of money."
4,Not a bad book,"Yes, one of the reviewer is right in saying that everything offered in this book can be learned in a meeting with an experienced IC designer. However, I think this book certainly has great value in terms of teaching an inexperienced person the basics of layout. This book may not be the great in terms of teaching one the concepts and nuances of analog layout and I would refer an aspiring analog layout person to ""Art of analog layout"" by Hastings or ""CMOS layout"" by Jacob Baker. These two books are really good for that need. This book in question however does fill the basic needs that it intends to. It gives a start to VLSI layout in general. I think that this book is a very good shelf companion for a person who is just into designing layouts."
2,Way too basic.,"Unless you know nothing about layout, this book is too basic for you. If you know nothing about layout, then it is probably ok."
2,Could have been good,"This album is really strange. 60 something tracks...Most of which are useless sound effects which could be an intro to a song. The tracks the band actually plays in are great...for about a minute, when they abruptly stop, and resume the sound effects. The songs could be really cool, if the band would just play them. The audio sample you get is basically the whole song. I recommend not buying this."
5,The riddle of steel for Basil Poledouris.,"I will not go into depth about how awesome this album is because a lot of other reviewers have already done a good job. This album has remained one of my favorite avant-garde black metal albums since it was first released.I just wanted to point out that Basil Poledouris wrote the music from track 30 to 32, the 9th movement. There are a few other songs on here that have been influenced by Basil such as Spinning Back the Clocks. I salute Anders Nystrom for being able to make a completely awesome cover of the Conan the Barbarian theme without even having to give credit to the original writer. I don't know how he got away with it, but job well done!With this album being virtually perfect in what I love about experimental black metal, it is a shame that this was the final Diabolical Masquerade album.Buy this album and go ahead and buy the Conan the Barbarian soundtrack, too."
3,Jacob's Rescue,"I like this book because it's a good book to read, and it's not fake like other book's I've read."
4,Jacobs Rescue,I think that it was a great book! It was the only book that I have ever read that made my eyes water. The holocaust must have been a terrifying thing to go through. The book made me think about what the people that were involved in the holocaust went through with the Nazis.
4,jacob's rescue,I thought the book was very interesting and had alot of action and adventure. the book had many good characters and good details for the readers. the book makes the reader feel like they are the people in the story. i can't wait to read the sequel.
3,"A Book Named ""Jacob's Rescue""",I liked Jacob's Rescue. I liked it because it had a lot of action. It made you want to keep on reading. It even made you feel bad for the characters that suffered. I like how it goes from the present to the past to the present. If you haven't read this book yet you should. I highly recommend this book to you.
4,jacob's rescue,I really liked this book. It was cool. I liked this book because it was very exciting. It kept me in my seat and made me keep reading. This book was also very historical. It told you about the Holocaust and how a Polish family hid two jewish boys. At the end the nazis are driven out of Warsaw and then Poland was safe again!
5,A PAGE TURNER,"I enjoyed this book because it kept me interested,it was never boring at any point. The main character was Jacob and I liked him because he was so strong. The best part was when Jacob got to leave his Jewish family and flee from the Nazis, and live with a Polish family. The ending of the book is great because Jacob has a suprise in his life. Read the book to find out what it is."
5,Jacob's Rescue,Jacob's Rescue was about a rich Jewish boy who gets put in the Ghetto with his Aunt Hannah and Grandma. Then Alex (a Polish man with a wife and two two kids) decides to hide him. Jacob has two brothers David and Shalom. There are many problems but in the end it all turns out well. Read the story to find out the true story of Jacob's rescue. It is a very good book about World War II and the Holocaust which lasted from about 1939 to 1945. I liked the way it was always exiting and kept me on the edge of my seat.
5,Jacob's Rescue,"Jacob's RescueI have never read a book about the Holocaust before and I didn't know much about it. This book is through a Jew's eyes and how bad it really was to be a Jew during the Holocaust. This is a book about a boy named Jacob who has to live with a Christian family because he is a Jew, and he needed a place to hide or he would be killed by the Germans. You read about all the problems a Jew would have gone through during the Holocaust. I really like this book because it was exciting and I couldn't wait until I read the next chapter."
5,Best bible ever!,"This bible is expensive, but to get all these translations in one bible is excellent and will save you money!"
3,The Word: The Bible from 26 Translations,"The only Bible translation I've found among 26 different translations as advertised is KJV. What are the others? If Amazon or the publisher named all 26 different versions, this will help me to choose it without future regret... Please do this!"
5,Christmas Cactus,"All of my plants ordered were packed well, though there were a few broken tips, which were replanted. The pots were full of plants and very healthy. Some are starting to bloom already."
2,Good Luck,"This seems to be a hit and miss situation. I sent the 6"" Christmas plant and it was a hit but these 4"" pots arrived as if they had not seen any sunlight for days. One's roots are looking pretty dead.IF you order these, order them for yourself not as a gift as I did. Nothing says ""blah"" like getting a dying plant in the mail for a birthday present.Hirt's reply was ""looks OK to me. Let us know if it dies."""
5,Red Christmas Cactus,"A few weeks ago, I purchased a Red Christmas Cactus from Richlin Gardens. Both my husband and I love Christmas Cactus and have grown them for years. When the plant arrived, unfortunately due to the time it'd spent cooped up in a box, and the fact that the soil it came in was wet, the plant rotted. I immediately notified Richlin Gardens and they sent a wonderful replacement. It arrived in terrific shape. Richlin Gardens, will bend over backwards to keep a good customer. You don't see very much of these these days."
4,"Great, but it got overplayed","I loved it when Jay-Z introduced this song on that otherwise horrible BET Awards show. And I loved this song with its flip of the J5' ""I Want You Back"" sample and his Snoop lingo (""For shizzle my nizzle""). But in the midst of trying to crown Jay-Z the king of rap before Nas came back out, when this song was played over and over again on video channels and on the radio, I couldn't stand it anymore. The song got old really fast."
4,Great program once you pass the install bugs,"The only issue I have in the installation of this product was the ""printer"". If it found no printer it would come up with these dialog boxes with large error messages. My son (3yrs when he received this product, now 4) soon got past those errors (which come up every time we start the game and the printer is not on). He loves it! To this day he will spend a good hour playing this game. It's not to tough for him, and yet it makes him think. I'm going to purchase the next one (I think I have all so far), and every one is a winner. Sorry to hear about the touble on install reviews, it truly is a great product once it is running."
1,WARNING - Windows Killer!,"I bought this game last night for my two-year-old, and installed it right away. Installation seemed to go smoothly, until it reached the point where it had to restart the system.I wish I hadn't clicked on ""OK"" so quickly. It would have been nice to say goodbye to a lifetime's worth of data and work.Yup, ""Thomas the Tank Engine: Trouble On The Tracks"" killed my computer dead. Windows is utterly corrupted, and I am now the proud owner of a $2,000.00 paperweight.""Windows must be reinstalled""...""Kernal32 corrupted""...and then nothing. I've never seen Windows deader than this, and I can't even reinstall. I've got a boot disk and will try again tonight, but at this point I have no way of knowing if ANY of my data has survived.The game cost $9.96 at Wal-Mart. It wasn't worth it."
1,Game Locks Up,"We purchased this software for our grandson who visits us regularly. We didn't notice how defective it was right away, until it was too late to return it.The game blacks out and locks up. It freezes our computer (Windows ME) in its tracks.We are out the money we paid for it, because we can't use it or return it. Our grandson is very disappointed because his Thomas game won't work. It's unfortunate that little kids have to pay the price for defective licensed merchandise..."
1,Thomas and Friends Trouble on the Tracks,"I bought this software for my 4 year old grandson. I'm sorry I did. He's a fairly smart little guy but he (and I) couldn't figure out how to navigate through this one. He got very bored with it very quickly. I'm sorry I purchased it. I guess if you like sitting in front of a computer and having a story read to you, then you'll like this. He kept asking me ""when am I going to get to play?"". I don't recommend buying this software."
1,SO SAD,"I am so disappointed with the Thomas the Tank Engine CD ROMS. I will never buy another one. SO SAD. My son loves Thomas so I bought the CD ROM game hoping it would different then the one I bought last Christmas that DIDN'T WORK. And yet again, my system is still not adequate enough for this game. I can run every other CD ROM I have purchased from other companies EXCEPT these. I cannot believe companies can get away with this. These Thomas CD's freeze up my system, prompt consistently with error messages, prompt that I need a new sound card and video card. WHAT A SHAME!!!!! ..."
2,Short shelf life,"My 3 1/2 year old son loved this CD for exactly 2 days, then became bored with it and hasn't picked it up since. The games on it are one-dimensional and not geared for long-term play."
2,A So-So game.,"My 4 year-old played with it for about 2 weeks and then she has never asked me to play it again. It's just not that interesting and challenging. You have to go at the software's pace of things, which is annoying since you may already be familiar with the instructions. So because the longevity factor doesn't last too long and the challenge factor is not there, I cannot recommend this game."
2,"""limited"" edition","Even though the animation and graphics are appealing, the depth of this game barely exceeds that of a birdbath. The tasks are few and simple, and the levels are barely discernable as different. The only reason my kids play this one is because of the catchy songs and images they warmly associate with the well done videos. Of little or no educational value. Hope they try again, perhaps with an education or child development consultant."
1,Not Worth It,"We purchased this software yesterday. We have well above the minimum system requirements of Pentium 166MHz and 32 MB RAM and the graphics, movement and sound are extremely choppy. This one definitely needs some refinement. We are returning ours."
2,Maybe too small?,"The size of this book is quite small 5x7. Now think about how small each black and white picture must be when there are 4 to each page. Yep, 2x2 and when your line of vision is seeing 8 (both pages) at the same time, it's difficult to focus on one individual block. I really dislike the black and white pictures. I know adding color would change the look of the block, but they all just seem to blend together without color. There are a few color pictures for directions. I'm not saying I won't use it, but I doubt I'll use it often."
1,Instructions Not Included!,"This book is for very experienced quilters only, in my opinion. I didn't see instructions regarding how to sew the various block parts together to make the block. This book might be a good idea to get for picking a block, but then you'd have to go elsewhere for instructions on how much fabric to buy and how to make it into something. I am very disappointed."
2,"lots of ideas, but measurements are off","At first I really loved this book. It has tons of ideas and blocks that I had never seen anywhere else before. I have a few dozen quilts under my belt, so I'm not exactly a novice, but I'm no expert, either. The problem came when I started trying to make the quilt blocks in this book. The first two I tried had incorrect measurements, but were salvageable. The third one I tried was so distorted that there was no fixing the pattern, and I had to end up re-designing my whole quilt into something totally different. I'm keeping the book for ideas, but I'll be checking elsewhere for measurements.I would recommend the Around The Block series by Judy Hopkins. So far, all the blocks I've used from her books have been spot on!"
4,A good basic book to create from,This book was recommended at a quilters' group meeting. Someone else has done all the work so people like to can just pick out the fabrics. God bless them!
4,1000 Great Quilt Blocks,I had barrowed this book from a friend and liked it so much I bought one for myself and gave one to my sister. It is well worth the money I spent to get it. It will pay for it self in the quilts I will make from the block patterns I get from this book.
4,1000 Great Quilt Blocks Review,"I have loved this book as a great reference to pieced quilt blocks, it has many historic blocks as well as many familiar ones to me. The index is very helpful, and it has many patterns included. All in all, a good book to have if you want to create unique quilt blocks."
5,Worked just great,"enjoyed it, cut my pavers like butter 100 of them and still looks good, a whole lot better than my solid diamond blade which after 7? I had to push machine hard, this will only ruin the bearings on my motor, any kind of bearing ..."
1,Great idea goes astray,"When I received this book as a gift, I was instantly interested. A day at the park through several different people's eyes? Sounds like a fantastic idea for a book right?Well, this book screws it all up. It is difficult to do a good job with multiple perspectives when no one perspective is done particularly well, and this book runs the gauntlet from boring to confusing to just plain bad. The writing is not particularly strong, which only adds to the drawn out feel that the book has by about 50 pages in.A day at fenway is something most people remember for years to come, hoeever ""One Day at Fenway"" is overly forgetable."
1,not much to it...,"I picked up this book about a week ago while shopping at my local bookstore. I was going to buy it without browsing (my standards for baseball books are fairly generous).But I decided to thumb through it; and I'm glad I did. The book is profoundly flawed. It's simply written and lacking substance. It reads like the sportswriting in the NY tabloids- mindless and reliant upon truisms and conventional wisdom- an expanded version of the drek I stridently try to avoid. If you're at all educated in the history, traditions, or science of baseball, read what's available on the internet, or, if old-style writing is more your speed, wait for a ""New Yorker"" in November. Skip this book."
1,One Day at Kindergarten,"Thank you, Kettman, for bringing me back to first-grade reading class. With the much storied tradition between these two teams, beloved Fenway Park, and the game of baseball, none of these emotions are evoked during the reading of this book.Other reviewers cite this book as a wasted opportunity. No, it is a waste of my money, your money, and even the single lousy star that I was forced to grant it in this review."
1,Yuck!,"They say it doesn't matter if you're a Red Sox fan or a Yankee fan, because you'll love this book. Apparently, however, it does matter if you are a fan of any other team in MLB because I thought this book was awful. It was written with the sophistication of a 7th grader on the short bus and had about as much insight as a rock. I suppose you could call it a page turner because I turned the pages as fast as possible trying to find something to enjoy. At pg 27 I gave up. Save yourself the trouble and don't even bother."
1,A truly bad book,"There are numerous books out there which capture the excitement and intensity of baseball rivalries with better prose, insights, and unknown facts than this lazy, dull, poorly written effort. Red Sox fans, do not buy this just because it's about your team. Your memories are worth more than the $25 it takes to buy this drivel."
3,Military Movie,I guess I've seen too many military movies lately and am tired of the same story over and over. This is another typical war movie.
3,Not True 1080p HD. Get the DVD.,"This is a great movie, very underrated in my opinion. However, I bought this blu ray and expected crisp 1080p picture quality. However, there are some grainy moments in the quality of the picture. It looked as if I was using an older dvd player with the three A/V components. There are also some strange dark blue streaks in the picture here and there. The disappointing thing is that this there was never any ""Wow"" Hd 1080p moments. The movie takes place in a lush jungle and you would think that there would be some great photography and HD moments. None comes to my head. If you really want to buy this movie, get the dvd. The blu ray is a disappointment."
2,disappointing,"this compilation is not what I expected. Many of the songs are ones I enjoy, but I guess I must of missed that fact they they are medlies and when I got the product, the longest section was the last track, a sermon on Christ being love. The prior 4 tracks went by quickly and I couldn't distinguish some of my favorite songs, especially ""Breathe"" in any of the medlies."
3,"Good, but covers songs that have been overdone","I have bought Michael W. Smith's albums since his ""Project"" many many years ago. He is very talented, and a lot fo people will like this album. THe only drawback, and it is a real one, is that most of the songs have already been done many times over. If you don't have a unique new approach or arrangement to songs that have oversaturated the market, then the question is WHY? Michael and friends have the talent and creativity to knock our socks off.We are still waiting...(...)."
4,"Great album, but...","The one and only complaint that I have about this CD is that some of the songs are a little too slow for me. Actually it's probably that the slower songs are all grouped together. Now don't get me wrong, I like those songs and they're great to be on the CD but I'd prefer a some more upbeat songs mixed in.Otherwise, this is a fantastic CD. I love live music and the crowd in this one really gets into it. I love singing along with this CD every time I listen to it."
5,Praise and Worship Music,"This CD moves me and helps me to feel God's presence again.many thanks for creating the CD, which is so profound"
5,great,great listen....Michael W. never lets me down. I have all his worship CDs and play them over and over. I'm hoping there's a new one coming soon.
4,awesome,"The first song on the cd is my favorite, I feel God saying, Yes this is what its all about. I am a Michael W Smith fan and this is an inspirational piece of work."
2,smith alive,i love Michael W Smith i was accpeteing something else other than what this is so i didnt give it high stars but the music is that glorifying GOd and could have been better more songs rahter than a teaching after the songs on disc.
5,An awesome listening experience,"This CD is a real blessing. From the upbeat ""Forever"" to the contemplative ""Above All"" the song selection is great and the renditions are inspiring. If you like to sing along (as I do!) or just listen to great praise and worship songs, this is a wonderful CD for you."
2,This One is for the Elevators,"Given Michael W. Smith's well-produced Exodus, I had high expectations for his new live worship release. But as soon as I started playing the tracks I was thrown back in time to the late-eighties/early-nineties - Maranatha/Hosanna Integrity days. Not only are some of the songs from that era, but it sounds like it was produced back then as well. Smith seems to lack a passion and energy when worshipping resulting in a slow, lethargic sound here. With songs like ""Awesome God"" and ""More Love / More Power"" - this one's definitely for grandma and grandpa. Smith offers nothing new; even songs like ""Breathe"" sound as if it's been Marantha-nized. I'm sure it was a wonderful experience live; unfortunately it doesn't translate well to the recording which is a shame given the high quality of live worship recordings out today."
3,Excuse me for being dissapointed,"I was expecting something A LOT BETTER from Smitty. Why? Because he has wonderful original praise songs in all his releases, because he did an amazing worship medley in Night in Rocketown, even because Third Day album set a new level for worship album and I wanted MWS to take the crown (godly speaking). I was expecting a most intimate setting, no big crowd no magnificent all-star choir, just plain worship. In the technical part, the sound is not the best in a live record. Yes, I was expecting too much, I was expecting A Night In Rocketown only with MWS. But understand me: he is Rocketown owner! It sounded logical to me!"
4,"Good, but not great","Michael W. Smith is one of my favorite singer/songwriters, and I have every album he has made. But this is a worship CD, not a new album. He does his favorite worship songs, and does an okay job, but I would much rather see him bring forth a whole album of new worship material- his track record is excellent. If you like the ""sing it 20 times"" model of modern worship, you will DELIGHT in this album. But I anticipate his next new material CD."
4,"Great songs, but a bit underproduced","I didn't realize that this was a (mostly) live recorded CD when I had purchased from a store a few months ago. While the songs are wonderful (Above All & Let It Rain are the climax point of this CD) I can't help but to feel that it is a bit under produced in terms of sound quailty. There is a lot of ambient noise from the crowd that can be heard, some songs it really helps (Let It Rain) others, it sort of distracts. Overall, this is a great CD. Michael W. Smith has a true heart of worship and continues to glorify God with his talents on this CD."
1,Was there a mistake?,"I finally decided to enjoy the Michael W Smith - Worship album I purchased last February. The disk SAYS it is the same album as the cover but it is not. The jacket says there are 13 songs. The actual disk has 5 tracks - it has three of those songs and maybe a fourth but I don't recognize it. The fifth and last track on the disk is a chapter of a BOOK!! ""Chapter 16, Unfailing Love - Love Never Fails""I tried a couple different players to be sure my computer wasn't doing something strange. I even tried different parts of the tracks to make sure the songs weren't in a medley format. Nope.This is supposed to be ""Used Like New"" Someone ripped someone off somewhere. I suppose it's too late to return and I only paid $3.99 for it but what a disappointment."
2,package looks correct but content wrong,"They sent me the wrong cd. the cover & front of the disc look correct but the disc is different. It only has only 5 tracks and only 2 songs are even Michael W Smith. I spent $7.98 to ship 2 day to have the product arrive in time to use for my worship event. Learned my lesson...buyer beware. Seller is listed on receipt as HUAHAI MA but has ""Master DVD"" as storefront on website."
1,"My first disappointment, what happened?","It was as if my cd was completely erased and then burnt over with only five songs vs. 12 and the fifth song was somebody talking, he sounded like the president. This was my first and so far only disappointment. The songs were not even by the musician. Sad situation."
5,Love it!!!,"These stoller straps are great. I use it for the shopping cart to hold my diaper bag and free up the cart space. These straps hold heavy bags and are durable and sturdy. This is the third type of straps, which the first two were broken after a couple of farmer market trips."
4,Everything looks good!,"The lighting at the stadium was terrific. Songs were stage edited a bit which I don't really like it. And most of the songs in 'In Blue' were to pop for my taste. It doesn't sound too natural to me. The show could have done better with another approach. But it's already in the past, so there's no need to argue.Nonetheless this is a successful for most of the fans. The sisters dressed pretty. This is their first DVD features DTS and multi-angle in a few songs. There's a 360 view on 'so young' if you have a pc."
4,LOVIN' LONDON,"This DVD surprised me alot. I am now wishing I went to the London concert. The DVD quality is excellent, the audio, the 5 camera angles and also the content such as awesome extras like interviews and such. My favourite song to watch is definetely TOSS THE FEATHERS and GIVE ME A REASON. Subtitles for lyrics are an added bonus. I think that a bit more extra features should've been added and it would of been excellent, but still this DVD is excellent."
2,Bad sound quality. Average video quality.,The sound is very low. It sound like being muffled. The lyrics are sentimental. The singers are attractive. I found most of the music sound the same.
5,the most realistic ones I found on the net,"I did a search and checked about 30 different plush opossum toys to find the one that most resembled my real opossum. These won! They are very cute, well-made, and my real opossum now has some friends. Super fast shipping and overall good buying experience."
5,Love ain't always enough!,"We all have had our ups and downs with love and T. Cass shows how everyday people get caught up, hurt, and why we run from the thing we want the most......LOVE. Jaslyn and Solomon prove that sometimes love just ain't enough. A great read!"
5,Keeping It Real,"T. Cass does a marvelous job of holding her readers' attention and coercing them to travel down memory lane with characters Sampson and Jaslyn. This book is certainly a riveting tale of two successful people who have it going on in every arena of their lives except the one that really matters--- a loving and honest relationship. T. Cass shows us that being in love is important, but taking risks with the one you love can set you free. Labor of Love is definitely a page turner..."
4,Labor of Thy Fruits,"Jaslyn's Mr. Right is taking longer than she had hoped. Her two decade search is coming up short and disappointing. Instead of having a perfect man should she settle for a piece of man?Sampson is only looking for Ms. Right Now. He is fine with holding it down with whoever wants to give up the booty to a fine, educated brother with a little cash. He has no plans of settling down. If they are not broke or crazy they don't know a good man when they see one anyway.T. Cass doesn't disappoint as she gives us hope on this journey of friends, family and relationships."
3,Insulated Teapot,"I bought this teapot some years ago, but truly, this was a bit of a whim buy for me. It keeps the tea hot of course, but the pour spout is really not the best, so drips occur and for a ""tea drinker"" like me, this is very annoying. It looks very ""English"" on the tray, but maybe you could use your own perfect teapot. As a gift for someone, it is ideal."
2,"Torn on arrival, 2 star for color and fit","I received it yesterday and one of the two accordion style back straps were torn.The straps are an alternating paper thin and thicker (not thick at all), which they should be for durability. Of course Amazon is sending a replacement, so that issue is solved. If you wonder why I didn't get a refund, well once on it fits exactly and ALL of the cut outs match the phone perfectly.I wanted an inexpensive pink cover to support breast cancer awareness. Based on the ""listed"" price I thought it would be a much higher quality. Just don't expect it to be very durable and inspect it thoroughly upon receipt."
2,Problems with this paper,"I've used this paper before with success, and it's often the least expensive paper option for A3+ prints. All good. But some some major flaws with it became apparent recently when printing night shots and reproducing blacks. Dark, black hues come out with a very odd metallic sheen to them, with a noticeable yellow/bronze color when the print is viewed at even a slight angle, which ruins the print. Thought at first it might be a bad batch of ink, or a printer/software issue, but the same photos, same settings, come out fine on 13x19 paper from other suppliers, and fine on even other HP paper (11x17). Very odd, but I'd be careful with this paper when using it for prints with lots of blacks."
5,Great price and fast shipping,"I got a great price on this photo paper, and it arrived quickly and in great condition."
4,"A great, goofy, fun adventure!","Jake Speed is a really fun and cute adventure movie, and with a great actor like John Hurt playing the bad guy, and a really cute Karen Kopins as the lead actress, it is a lot of fun, a cute and fun adventure with some good humor, and I recomend this to anyone who like a fun and funny action/adventure movie, or to those who like movies such as Shanghai Noon or Knight's, other Jackie Chan movies, Ice Pirates, and movies like this, and if you like these you will really enjoy Jake Speed!"
1,The worst movie I've ever seen.,"I belong to a bad cinema club (only 4 members) and we have, without reserve voted this the worst movie ever. Wayne Crawford makes Pauly Shore look like Sir Lawarence Oliver! The script is horrible, the acting is awful... It just plain stinks. If you only have 2 hours left to live watch ""Jake Speed"", it will seem like 10!"
3,Worth a look if you like the off-beat.,"Not my favorite, but up there somewhere, away from the bottom of the list. It is a cute little action-fantasy with a unique twist (the adventurers document and sell their adventures as fiction) and some interesting philosophy ""if you want/need something badly enough, it will happen"". One of those culty type movies where only those that ""get it"" enjoy it but worth the effort. Always remember: If you want to be entertained, see a movie. If you want to be enlightned, climb a mountain."
4,Entertaining Action Flick,"Being a big fan of both 80s movies and adventure series like The Destroyer, I'm surprised I only recently discovered this movie.Wayne Crawford is Jake Speed, the hero in a series of action novels. Unlike Remo Williams and Mack Bolan, Jake Speed's books are based on his real adventures. If there's an easy way to solve a problem, Jake will look for a more exciting alternative. Makes for a better story.It seems the story and locations may have been affected by a limited budget, but this is a well-written and fun story. Mark Snow did the soundtrack - finally on CD!If you've ever enjoyed The Executioner, The Destroyer, or any of the action-adventure serials, buy this DVD. You'll find yourself watching it more than once."
2,"Music worth it, but the ""Enhanced"" features AREN'T","I saw the special for this CD on CMT. Even though I already have most of the songs on the CD, I wanted the enhanced videos so I decided to buy it. In small print on the back of the CD it says that the enhanced features won't work on some computers, but I took the chance anyway. Well I've now tried this CD on several different makes/models and haven't gotten the enhanced features to work YET!"
5,Great and really fun.,"""I Love My Car"" is one of Belle & Sebastian's most fun songs ever. It is an upbeat and kind of goofy song to lighten your spirits. In a day when so much music is depressed, anti-establishment, post-modern, and the list goes on, this track reminds us there is so much more to life than lust, conspiracy, and politics. And I just love the horns! I would buy this album just for this song. It has made my week.The two other tracks are strong, ""standard"" Belle & Sebastian, and worth the purchase also. Overall a great EP and release by Belle & Sebastian. I understand that these tracks will no appear on the next LP, so fans best pick it up."
3,Trivial treasures,"Another quaint success of mild proportions, B&S provided an endless supply of hold-me-overs before full lengths. IWUTU won't likely be the layover to win any new converts, but it preaches to the choir just fine."
4,one of their better eps,"I'm Waking Up to Us is a fantastic ep if only for the last song, Marx and Engels. Marx and Engels sounds as if the song was written in their glory days. Longtime fans will love the reference to ""a thousand meals being made on Saturday"". This song has Stuart Murdoch's genius phrasing of the vocals much like past classics. I'm Waking Up to Us takes some getting used to but proves to be very good as well. I Love My Car is crap - sounds like one of those Stuart David songs when he was with the group. Cheers to Belle & Sebastian for another great gift to the music world."
5,How Could it Be Any Less Than 5 Stars?,"It's Belle & Sebastian... Need I say more?...and if I do, than you're just not listening enough!"
2,The slow-motion decline of B&S continues,"Once again, as with ""Jonathan David,"" we hear the band going through the motions. The first two songs show a newfound and inexplicable affection for brassy George Formby English dancehall songs. The music is a poor fit with B&S, and the lyrics are not worthy of them; the songs tell no story, set no mood... in fact, they don't do much of anything, other than show the dangers of misguided experimentation.On the third song, ""Marx and Engels,"" as on ""Jonathan David""'s ""Take This Carriage Clock..."" we get a hint of the old, pre-compromise B&S: literate lyrics melded with a catchy melody and sterling musicianship. It's a shame this isn't enough for them anymore. Apparently, Stuart is bored; perhaps he, and the band, should call it a day."
5,Wine - From Grape to Glass,A great book for someone like me who was looking to learn a good overall understanding of the various wines and regions around the globe. Very thorough and a great format with wonderful photography.
3,traditional,Alot of old and traditional techniques in this book. Came very vast in the mail. faster then all the other students in my class who orderd from a book store.
4,A great book,"I have to give a lot of respect to the Dr. for having written this book. I was no where close to understanding the life of this wonder amazing prophet may God bless him and may peace be upon him. I really enjoyed reading this work and it strengthened my resolve to become a better person and dedicate my life to Allah (God). I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in religion, and who enjoys history and religion."
4,does it leave a mark,This band plays some very solid hard rock.If you like drowning pool and disturbed you will like this music.Good album
5,2002 CD OF THE YEAR,"WHAT CAN YOU SAY? NEED TO FEEL, THE ONE, BLACK STAR 7 AND ALL THE REST ARE SURPURB. ALSO GBBMA GROUP OF THE YEAR. EXCELLENT VOCALS AND TREMENDOUS SYNCAPATION THIS GROUP OF HARD ROCKERS WILL GO FAR."
3,nothing special,"I first heard the song halo on channel 800-something on my satellite dish and I thought it was great so I downloaded it and said to myself, this band might be big someday. A few months later I was watching MTV cause for a change they were playing metal videos (I was as shocked as you are) and I saw them play Halo. I couldn't believe it. However, although Halo is a good song, it is repetitive and gets old pretty fast. The lead singer has a good voice but they aren't great song writers and the rest of the cd has little to offer. It might be worth a look, but I wouldn't recommend buying it over other bands out there."
3,Very Good Freshman Effort,"If you're like me and you picked up Soil's second CD ""Redefine"" before buying ""Scars"", you may be disappointed that the 5-star performance on Redefine is just not there on Scars. Scars has its moments and the rock is hard indeed. Scars has the same power as Redefine does. But the music on Redefine is clearly more seasoned and mature. Most noticeably missing from Scars while omnipresent on Redefine are the sing-along lyrics and choruses. Bottom line: There's a clear difference between the first CD and the second....Perhaps that's one of the reasons Soil titled their second ""Redefine"". Scars is good hard rock. But if you're here after first purchasing Redefine in hope of finding more non-stop awesomeness on Scars...don't say I didn't warn you."
4,Soil is Fertile,"I first came across this band because of a bad review on Amazon. I am glad that the individual decided to point out in their review that they did in fact throw this cd into the garbage, which in turn made me want to listen to it!This is fantastic. for someone to label Soil as a horrible band must be one of Two things; Deaf, or in bad taste.if you're a fan of Alice in Chains, Pantera or even hard rock and are looking for somehting a little modern, I recomend at least listening to this album more than once.Soil recieves four stars out of five due to the similarities in a couple of songs and hey, there just needs to be a greater number or songs on the record I finished it wanting another couple of tracks."
3,Nothing Special,"I first heard the song halo on channel 800-something on my satellite dish and I thought it was great so I downloaded it and said to myself, this band might be big someday.

2,Marc's review,"This album is quite interesting. The lead singer has a good voice to go along with good music. I heard ""halo"" and i had to get the cd. It is worth your money to get it."
4,An Extremly Uniqe Rock Band,I dont have much to say exept that this is one of the best cds i have ever listened to.the gitar and drum combination is amazing and fits perfectly to the singer's voice.when i listen to it i feel like i'm becoming 5 times stronger than i really am...it revives me !!!
5,Amazing,"I used to be in to rap, but my friends changed me to a hardcore metal fan. Soil is probly my favorite band in my cd case. I have all 3 cd's. Soil's beats are the frickin' best, i love the gutair. The only band I can think would match their greatness would be FLAW! SOIL IS THE ... BEST!!!!"
4,No-Nonsense Guitar Rock,"This is one hell of a refreshing CD. It's pure rock. It even has the standard rock band formula: 2 guitars, wild lead singer, drums and bass. Each song has just as much energy as the one before it. If you sometimes get a little sick of ""rap-rock"" this is a must-have. It is purely hard, no frills rock. Gotta love that."
4,Scars,"This is a great album, with only a few flaws. As far as I know, (correct me if I err), this is their first album. It has a great metal sound, but a few of the songs get repetitive over time. This album stuck with me, and was the first thing to make me put down Nickelback's new album for more than a week. I found myself humming the tunes and hitting the beat when I wasn't listening, and waiting until I could. I recommend this to anyone who likes hard metal-rock."
4,WOW is all I have to say,"I went to the Merry Mayhem tour not knowing who these guys were...after seeing them, I knew that they were pretty good. I saw them on the same tour 2 nights later and was blown away...they actually improved their performance. I picked up the CD, and actually met the band that night. They were really great guys, and the CD is incredible. Not a trace of rap, and it is just as heavy as anything else out there. I recommend to fans of Black Label Society...you will dig this."
4,"""Excelent...Ha...ha...ha""","I just have to say that SOiL's Scars is a great album. I find the Vocals amazing, and If you ever figure out all the Lyrics, you will find that they have a lot in them. Ryan pours alot of emotion into the music, which once again, sounds great. Some of the best songs on the CD are HALO, Unreal, Black 7, and Need to feel. The vocals do sound some what computerized but it is hardly noticeable because you get lost in the music. They are going places."
4,Quite Good...,"This a good metal album, not a great one like System of a Down,Sevendust, or Disturbed's. But a solid one all the way through, no rap/rock here, this is solid ""old fashioned"" nu-metal. Similar like SOil who are also good are Stereomud,No One, and I think one that is extremely good, Louisville's Flaw. Standout tracks include the single ""Halo,"" ""Unreal"" as well as ""Black 7"""
3,potential...but nothing too potent.,"i bought this cd at wherehouse today ... yeah, i had heard of them, that they were good, so i picked it up.the riffs are good, but they are repeated. the lyrics could be much better. the singer is okay. some of the songs run together. they are not in any way original, but they know what they're doing. and if they can come up with something good, they will kick ...though i have to say that i don't see how people can compare this to godsmack--perhaps the voices are similar, but come on. godsmack is much better."
4,Good rock music,"Good hard rocken guitars with pounding drums I love it. The only thing that will get on my nerves after awhile is the singers opera like thing he does ocassionally, not on every song so I can just go past that song if it gets on my nerves... but overall its a good CD. If you like Pantera, Deftones, S.O.A.D., American headcharge, static x you will like these guys!!! Check it out!!!"
1,THEY RUINED THEMSELVES,Whether you know it or not Soil used to have possibly the best vocal/guitar combo ever. They originally had Serj Tankien & Daron Malakian both of which are now with System of a Down. I've heard some of their underground stuff that featured Serj and Daron and it was about 500% better than what they put out now. Without Serj and Daron Soil is ungroovy and seing them...just proved that point even more.
2,Who are they and what have they done w/the real Stuck Mojo?,"I dont know what happened.. I waited and waited for this release, only to find out I never would have bought it if it was someone else's. Twisted is a decent song.. So is Revolution.. All I really want to say, is that this album no where near comes comes to Declaration of a Headhunter."
4,One Last Taste of The Mojo Crew!,"If you're looking for the best Stuck Mojo, buy HVY1, Rising or Pigwalk. This is just a collection of unreleased songs by the inventors of Rap-core from the ATL! If you're a career long fan of Mojo, you'll appreciate this, if not, like I said, buy HVY1 recorded live at the Masquerade right here in ATL with me in attendance.Stuck Mojo will be missed! You can check out ex-members in Life of Agony, Fozzy, and Sick Speed!"
5,Frankie Laine at his best.,"I accidentally discovered this album rummaging through the CD cheapies at Wal-Mart. It has most of Laine's best original recordings and the audio quality is excellent. I have played it over and over again. If you are a Frankie Laine fan, the combination of quality and price makes this a must buy."
1,no back up support,"we bought this 6 months ago and it still doesn't work. there is an 800 number on the package that is out of date. when you finally get to the correct support you don't actually get a person. you are only prompted to do things, to most non computer geeks like myself this program is useless. don't bother buying it. your kids will say ""how come you can't get it going"". You'll put it away and try again later. Again with no success. Skip this one."
1,Crap!,"Crap, Crap, Crap! I hated this game. The Mystery Rider was obviously --------. I did not like this game and would not recommend it. It has characters including Spongebob Squarepants, the Angry Beavers, Ickis and Stimpy, Tommy, and many more. This game is definitely a piece of CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Exactly as described.I've used this product before and it comes w/ good directions. Was new in box w/ accompanying info.,Exactly as described.I've used this product before and it comes w/ great directs. Was new in box w/ accompanying info.Wish the spring wasn't quite so easy to break-it is a little fragile.
4,very nice planner,"So far this is a very good planner. It does what it is supposed to do, and very easy to handle. The only reason I would not give it five stars is because I have not seen yet how it will hold up over time."
4,The reality behind justice,"A fascinating book into how high priced lawyers can convince any jury your Mother is worse than a serial killer. Essentially that is the conclusion I got from the book.Some of the stories are too long and complicated with lots of names, so that is why I am giving it 4 instead of 5 stars. It also was not clear to me what exactly happened in some of the murders, particularly the last one on Safre."
2,"Too much of OJ, not enough new material","I've been there, done that, got a T-shirt already with Dunne'sVanity Fair articles. Although, he is very straight forward,witty, and entertaining, I had already read most of what hehad to say. Dunne has wonderful commentaries on the American Justice System and how it relates to the American Society, but,again, all rehash. And why was so much of this book dedicated toOJ? Haven't we heard enough of OJ already? After reading selected chapters, I put this book down and am now reading another wonderful book, A Reason To Live, by Billy Hills andDale Hudson. It, too, is about victims and the faults of the American Justice System, and written as well as Dunne's book, only it is new, creative and fresh material. Sorry, Mr. Dunne,you are a good writer, and one of my favorite authors, but youdespearately need some new material."
3,Mostly a re-hash ...,"I love Dunne's writing about the ""criminal rich and famous"", but most of these essays I had read before. Disappointing in that he's making big bucks from re-publishing many of the same articles again. If I hadn't read any of them before, though, it would have been a very worthwhile purchase."
2,Un Dunne,"I have limited time to read and am fairly selective about the books that I choose. My interest in the author's perspective compelled me to purchase this book. I was disappointed to find that the description of criminal events was, at best, public knowledge. Further, I was exasperated by the continuous name dropping that added little to the content. In spite of Mr. Dunne's impressive list of famous friends and acquaintences, his brushes with the elite provide no better insight into the criminal activities about which he writes."
2,Same Material Bound Up In A Book,"From my rating you would never think that I actually enjoyed the writing in this book and thought it was a good read. However, it was almost all rehashed material from the work he writes for Vanity Fair.Reading this, I felt like I was watching a TV show where the writers couldn't come up with enough new material for the show so they do a flashback episode where about 10% is new material and the remainder is previously shown material. Dunne did the same thing here. No new crimes or material to work with, need a book, so crank out the old with a few updates on where the cases have progressed to.In addition, much of the material was very dated. I don't think there is much left to say or know about the OJ trial, yet about 1/2 the book was related to that case. Yawn!Save the money and take it out of the library if your a Dunne fan, otherwise skip it."
4,Good Book - Great Read,"Dunne's new book is fascinating and difficult to put down. It is a collection of stories he wrote for Vanity Fair, covering the trials of O.J. Simpson, the Menendez brothers, and other cases.My only complaint -maybe ""suggestion"" is a better word since the book was so good- is that he should have included a timeline and synopsis of each case. The stories make sense only if you really followed the case.I think everyone would not have a problem with the OJ chapters, but I got lost on some of the other cases while reading his stories. He should have put the dates his stories appeared, so the reader can see where in the timeline of events the story fits.Other than that, I thought it was a great book. Dominick Dunne is eminently interesting, and I love the way he writes. He would be a great dinner guest!"
3,This is really a book about the trial of OJ Simpson,"While I did enjoy ""Justice,"" it was not what I expected. I wasn't aware that the book is a grouping of Mr. Dunne's articles from ""Vanity Fair."" The book was off to an excellent start with a chapter about Dominique Dunne that made me cry. However, it quickly moved into numerous chapters about OJ Simpson (this was the bulk of the book). The book is worth reading if you are an OJ Simpson junkie. If you are not, I recommend skipping that part. I also could have done without Mr. Dunne's constant references to all the famous people he knows."
3,If you liked this book....,"If you liked this book, you will enjoy the true story of ""Beautiful Bad Girl, The Vicki Morgan Story."" Dunne used this story of Alfred Bloomingdales mistress and her headline grabbing murder as the basis for ""An Inconvenient Woman."" The real story is fascinating and compelling.Beautiful Bad Girl: The Vicki Morgan StoryA must read for fans of true crime."
1,Reads a little too gossipy...,"Briefly interesting, but after awhile it begins to read like a syrupy tabloid. Also, as the narrative went through the murder account and trial of Dominick Dunne's daughter, I couldn't help but think, why didn't the author do more to keep his daughter away from this convicted criminal? Maybe I missed something, but he was in the know that his daughter was involved with a convicted abuser: why didn't he do everything in his power to bring his daughter back away from this creep?Anyhow, as for the rest of the book, I really couldn't care less about individuals like Claus von Bülow, so the text tended to drag."
2,Dropping names and opinions,"Dunne is a hack when he tries to discuss the criminal justice system. His opinions are obviously not always incorrect, but he reveals a lot of misconceptions about the law and trials. His biggest asset seems to be that he knows and is known to many wealthy, famous or whatever individuals. One gets the impression that he is a groupie of both criminal trials and the rich and famous and inflates his own status. This collection of articles varies from really poor to average in intelligence and content."
1,Names galore,The man cannot string two words together without name dropping. It is disgusting and so is he.
2,repeat stories,"Ok, I am aware that this is a compilation of previously published material but at least a hundred pages of this book were also published as Fatal Charms in the late 80's. His daughter's story, von Bulow, and the Bloomingdale mistress- all great stories and that magical Dunne prose but it's a bit thick the second or third time around. So for example the von Bulow story was in VF, then Fatal Charms and now in Justice. I read VF each month only for Dunnes wonderful column but I was disappointed at the repeat material."
2,Disappointing book,"This books is very disjointed and never caught my attention, despite my devotion to true crime accounts (and a Dominick Dunne fan usually). Not recommended."
3,Let's Eat Out,"I first want to say that I LOVE Dominick Donne and his writing. I find him fascinating, and his knowledge of all the players in these stories is pivotal in his perspective. However, a great deal of this book is a re-hash of his previous works. I bought this on audio tape, and this was probably the best way to know this work. To hear these tales in the author's own voice is compelling and addicting. I enjoyed the stories even though some of them were familiar. Mr. Donne knows the score and I appreciate his viewpoint.P.S. I want to be on the dining out list!"
2,Too much OJ; just rehash of Vanity Fair articles,"I read anything by Dominick Dunne. I find his novels (usually based on real crimes) to be fast paced and interesting. This book is just a rehash of previously written Vanity Fair articles; which I didn't know when I got it. I enjoyed reading the stories of his daughter and the Menendez brothers, but living in LA, I was really tired of how much OJ there was. I also got tired of reading about Michael Viner and Dove Books. Too many names listed and all of their connections, which took away from the storyline."
5,Dunne does it again!!!,"I've read most of Mr Dunne's books and he continues to hold my interest. I have the utmost of respect for this gentleman...his unbiased yet ""in your face"" take on the upper crust's trials and tribulations are bar none...right on the money, so to speak.I hope Mr Dunne keeps on doing what he does best...and that is TELLING THE TRUTH!~"
3,A book filled with Name Dropping,"This book is broken down into chapters, generally each being a different murder. There were 10 of the 18 chapters devoted to the OJ trial. I have read and heard enough of that legal debacle to last me a lifetime. I probably would have enjoyed the book much more, had a skipped that section.I did enjoy several of the other chapters, especially the heartfelt story of Dunne's murdered daughter and my heart goes out to him and his family.I generally love this type of a book,but found it hard to stay interested. There was a great deal of name dropping, which didn't seem to fit into the stories and I found the chapters on the Menendez murders very hard to follow."
4,I liked the book,"I was familiar with Dunne because of his writing with Vanity Fair. I also knew about the murder of his daughter, Dominique. This is the first book I've read by Dunne, and I'm impressed. It was painful to read about the terrible injustice his family went through when his daughter's killer got off the hook. I also loved how he wrote about the OJ trial as it progressed, rather than hindsite. I'm looking forward to more books by Mr. Dunne. I don't care if he's a social climber or not, this was a very interesting book!"
2,Way too much O.J.,"Mr. Dunne devotes way too much energy and space to OJ Simpson. I paid for a 337 page book, yet only read less than half of it. I just flipped through the middle part about the OJ trial. I will admit that I was glued to the tv during the trial, and yes-I bought two of the better written OJ books-I didn't want a third, and that is what I got. The Von Bulow trial, and the Martha Moxley case were much more compelling yet they seemed to be a minor part of this book.I do like Dominick Dunne's writing, but I wish that he had given equal time of some of the other trials."
5,A Great Read!,"Dominick Dunne's latest book is a collection of essays written during the the most celebrated crimes of the last few decades. These are essays and do not tell the whole stories, but give gripping accounts and compelling descriptions of various events. You will want more if are not familar with the cases. Check out his other writings including the monthly Vanity Fair submissions and ""Another City Not My Own"" (more OJ) for more enthralling nonfiction. His best work, in my opinion, remains ""A Season in Purgatory"" which is based on the Martha Moxley murder and is timely reading with Skakel's pending trial for the murder."
4,A fascinating world that most of us will never touch...,"Dunne moves in circles that I scarely knew existed anymore. Well, I knew they were around of course, just not in my world. He exists often in a world that the Society pages in our newspapers once fawned over. Those days, as Joe Epstein argues in ""Snobbery"" are largely gone. However, Dunne moves in what is left of it. But, what sets him apart (makes him far more than a name dropper that some ridicule him for being) is his compassion for victims. His own loss is moving. He is funny, warm, honest, and never pulls his punches. He is elegant and real. This book of essays is well worth your time."
2,Maybe ... maybe not,"Web page says 5 mins of light - instructions say 3 minutes. That's what I get - 3, not 5. And the buttons on both are momentary contact, i.e., as soon as you let go the light goes off. Might be useful to find the fusebox, or even better, the batteries for your REAL flashlight!"
1,Junk,"I bought two, one worked well for several days then no amount of shaking produces any light. When it worked, the light output was sufficient for normal use. The other worked for about 6 months - it was in my pickup which I drove to work and apparently was positioned so that it was being charged periodically. Then I checked it, it worked and I put it back into the pickup not thinking about that it was not laying flat - now no amount of shaking produces any light (it lights as it is shaken, but no longer stores charge)."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS FLASHLIGHT,"The first time you use the flashlight you have to shake it for 3 minutes, which feels like 3 hours. The light is useless. It is VERY dim. It as almost useless as a flashlight (even in a dark closet). I give it 1 star as a science tool on a classroom etc."
3,Arnold's Park,"I visited Arnold's Park since I was very young. The roller coaster was long and crickety - the best way to get a thrill! I have to admit, I hunted down the film because it was set at Arnold's Park. And, I'd watch it again to see... Arnold's Park."
1,Not a Great Film,"It is not a well done film. I only bought it because a lot of it was filmed in Okoboji, Iowa. I live in the area and it was fun to see places I know."
1,Like a Plot from a Soap Opera,"This movie is like a plot from a daytime soap opera that would be played out over a year and a half, here pieced together to form a feature-length film. Like most soap opera plots, it's corny and ridiculous and has many holes, flaws, impossibilities, etc. The acting is also horrendous as is the script, loaded with corny and laughably bad dialogue horribly delivered by the actors. It does have potential to be a so bad it's good piece of entertainment, if you're in the mood for that. Then again, it really is so bad that you may not even find it that good."
3,Refreshing B movie,This movie is refreshing in a unique way. If watched knowing it is not a major motion production but a low budget I think you'll appriciate the movie. It keeps you guessing til the end.
5,Arnold's Park,"Interesting, entertaining. It reminded me of movies from the 40's, when more emphasis was on the script and actors versus explosions. Nice twist at the end."
5,Casey Garven is Magical!,The title says it all! His portrayal of Billy Ross has inspired the 10's of people that have seen this movie!
4,Nice,This song really speaks for itself. If you are confused about your love one and just want away to get it out this song is nice and slow and will give you just what your looking for!
5,Love it,"Great graphic, wonderful interface, loads of exicitement and options. I love space games and this is one of the best I have. Especialy good is the need to mine resources and research new technologies. Great game."
5,One of the greats,"This game is absolutely spectacular. I'm sure you've all seen the Death Star and such, but you've never controlled the monster space ship. Now you can. Command 50+ ships, ranging from the 80 ton Scout, to the 800,000 ton Heavy Cruiser, to the biggest ship ever made, the 30 mile long, 5 million ton ship, the Mothership. This is truly an amazing game. The graphics are crisp, but starting to show their age. I can't wait for Homeworld 2 to come out. I'll be one of the first people to buy it. The soundtrack is excellent. The cutscenes are good, and the storyline is absolutely epic. This is one of the best games you can buy for any amount of money."
5,The best of the best of the best!!!,"I bought back in 2000 when it just came to the stores and when i saw it ive allmost screamd the graphicks of thisgame is he best you can find and i remind you that it is out there for almost 2 years. The campgin andthe storyline are superb and the music is increadible. There is only one thing that can be improved: the controls, it will take some time toget used to them but once you will adapet you will feel very goodabout the controls becouse you push so many bottons at once you feel as if your really controling a complex machine"
5,This is IT!,"If you enjoy scifi games or real-time strategy in general, you will enjoy this game. I've been playing it for years and still enjoy it greatly. 3-D combat in deep space with fighters, capital ships and special ships like cloak generators and long-range sensors. Take command and hang on..."
5,My dream has come true!,"I've always wanted to play a really engrossing space sim, something like a movie / game. Well, after playing a lot of games without any engrossing gameplay, I decided to try out Homeworld. I'm glad I did! Homeworld is the BEST space RTS / Sim / Movie I've ever played! I feel like I'm taking part in a movie with the great music, voice overs, and cut scenes. The engine graphics are just amazing! I'm finally seeing the true power my of pc!With that said, I do believe I will be playing Homeworld for quite some time. There's so much to do and explore, it really is a great game. If your one to try new games without all the hype, give Homeworld a try. It will change your whole attitude towards RTS games. Starcraft just doesn't seem to have any feel now after playing Homeworld.Game of the Year bundle: The music CD is great! As for the Prima guide, it's as bad as all their other guides. Large print, lack of pages, and lack of rich content. Oh well, it's free anyway :)"
1,It's really fun...I hear,"I couldn't make it work, not even on my brand new HP Pavilion laptop with the Pentium 4 and 168 MB of free RAM. Apparently, my drivers are incompatible, and I won't be changing my computer just to play this game. Also, Sierra Studio's web site tech support has a veritable phone book of complaints on every one of its games. This does not inspire confidence. Plus, the theoretical ""solution"" they recommended to me required multiple purgings and adjustments to my hard drive--forget about that! I was really looking forward to this game, but had to send it back because of technical problems. If you have any doubts about compatibility, you might want to skip this one."
1,Execellent Game . . . in theory,"In theory this would be a Excellent game but after i bought it for its good reviews i learned quickly that i should have downloaded the demo first. Well that was a waste of money it is hard to control everything (bad user interface) in 3d and basically it gave me a headache, i am sticking to 2d games until they make an brain interface device for me to control the ships bc thats how hard it was for me to control everything. And it was quite boring! Usually i don't write reviews and i usually like Sierra games but this one is just horrible. Maybe i could trade it off to one of my friends. don't forget download the demo first."
1,bought with great expectation,"i bougfht this game with great expectations, but i didn't like it in the least bit, its got an awsoem story lien and greta gameplay, i just don't liek 3drts, to you 2d rts fans, this is nothing liek a 2d rts, i found it very boring, and extremely annoying how the veiw system works.."
1,Homeworld: Game of the Year Edition,"Do not buy this game! It may be wonderful, if playable, but many boxes contain CD's erroneously packaged in white paper sleeves rather than a plastic jewel case. The install program requires entering a code from the jewel case. Without it, you've just spent [the money] on a beverage coaster . . ."
5,Look out! Major time drainer!,"If you have papers to write, real work to do, or have an active social life this game could be a problem. The game opens up with a wonderful step by step tutorial, (which you will need turst me) and then sucks you right in. Unlike most real time strategy games this one varies the missions, the opposition, and the locations in wild and wonderful ways. There is endless flexiblity in how you can build your forces and use them to fight. I can not tell you how many hours I have played this game, both in single and multi-player modes. This game is fantastic in short. I will warn you though, I have known people to get phisically ill due to watching the game, so if you are really prone to get car sick etc. you may need to use a little caution when playing."
3,"Nice Chronicles of Life in Jordan Park, the Projects","It provides a true prospective of the non-criminal aspects of Project life. It was all-good. I too, grew up in Jordan Park and have experiences quite similar. I'd like to think I was smooth.There was a meaning in the behavior of the girls and women in our lives that may not be apparent in the book. They were looking for supporters and candidate life-long mates. I went back a few years ago and was surprised to hear that perspective from women. Some of them are still bitter at me and were very critical, and among other things - reminded me that I did not marry them.About the book: It is an ""easy read, and fun"" book. If you are over 18, read it!"
2,Not Erotic !,This was a tasteless erotic memoir. I didn't find it erotic. It starts out unbelievable when the author states on page two that at the age of six in the first grade he sat next to the same little girl and whenever the teacher wasn't looking he would put his hands inside her panties and play with her stuff. I've heard of starting young but that is unbelievable. This collection of different sexual encounters wasn't erotic. It was just plain sex. With such a promising book cover the stories lack depth and creativity. However the book was full of comical events but needs a little steam. Born to Lust just really lacks.Reviewed byCandy
5,A great no-coaster drive,"This drive has been very solid. I have never made a coaster in hundreds of burns. The only bad thing about this drive is a really high noise level while spinning. Other than that, this drive has been 100%!"
3,Good CDRW for the Price,"3 stars, middle of the road. This CDRW is average, burns well, but not great, runs fast, but not very quiet, pretty reliable, but gets hot fast. For the $80 I paid for mine, I'd say IO got $80 worth of CDRW. Granted it's not a 32X Plextor, but it has some great qualities as well. You may have noticed that the only complaints are fron users with poor technical skills. If you go to Roxio's website and download the updates for EZCD 5, you can use EZCD Creator with no problems. Nero is better, but not as user friendly or feature laden. For those that are worried about installing it - just put the plastic jumper on the MA pins in the back, plug the end of your ribbon cable into the back and the other end into the slot marked IDE 2 on your motherboard and your done. Or if you only need one drive, just make the plastic jumper look like your old drive's setting and then swap 'em. EZ as pie."
1,Total[ly bad],"This drive is total junk. I got it, and then put it into my computer. I had to re-install windows 2000 to get it to work. Then It was not compatible with Easy CD creator..and then to top it off, when I actualy went to burn cds, it burned the cd, but the CD did not work in any cd drive...not even the burner. I would suggest that you look somewhere else for a CD burner."
1,waste of time money and energy,"This Piece of junk was sent to me and i took it in my hand and there were things rattling inside, which gave me a premonition of things to come. Well it just didnt work, it wouldnt spin. Send it back by air express....phew!!! I then ordered the yamaha 16X, and ill let you know about it soon.."
3,Great burner with little support,Burns great but half of my software doesn't support it.Non supported are GoldenHawk CDrWin and Roxio Video Pack.Nero and DiskJuggler work fine with it. I sent several e-mails to their support team and have yet to receive a response.
1,No support if something goes wrong,"The installation guidelines were very poorly written and I had to purchase a longer internal IDE connection to connect to the motherboard. Even though I have a good knowledge of computers I found the installation to be quite difficult. Since then, I have been able to copy disks but not get the CDRW function to work (the drive/software will not format the CDRW disks).The drive contains no phone numbers (not even one for paid support) or email address for any hardware support (and after much websearching I have not found any offered by the manufacturer... The bundled NERO software offers basic online support, but this has not resolved the problem (there are also no software manuals at all). Hence, after two days of searching for help, I still do not know if this problem is a hardware or software error. So, based on my experience I think that you will be better off spending more on a player from a reputable manufacturer that offers tech support."
2,Cheap cdrw means cheap quality,"I had a terrible time getting this to work on my Windows2000 computer. I had an old 2x CDRW with Adaptec DirectCD installed. After uninstalling Adaptec (as required to use Nero), and then reinstalling Nero, Windows2000 could no longer readany CD-ROM or CD-RW devices any more due to a ASPI layer problem. I checked USENET newgroups and found that tons of people have this problem. So as a reminder, Windows2000and Adaptec DirectCD are NOT supported by this drive.I have to reinstall Windows2000 again to get my CD-ROM to work again. In a word, ""LOT'S OF PAIN"". The support from their website (...) is a joke to say the least."
5,The funkiest CD ever!!! Nothing but great grooves!!!,"If this doesn't get you smiling, your feet tapping, and your ass shaking, you shouldn't be listening to music. - Go see a doctor, because you are deaf or missing your rythym bone!!Simply put - Maceo IS Funk, and this is his best ever.Buy this NOW!!!I'd also advise getting extra copies for your friends.I guarantee they will thank you!"
3,How did this happen?,"This album is a more hip-hop/funk based album rather than the usual straight funk that Maceo is known for from James Brown, The JB's, P-Funk, and anything else he's done. You can totally tell that this album was produced in the 90's because it has that cheesy funk feeling to it. I am not taking away from Maceo, because I love everything else that he's played, but this album is just not cuttin' it for me. Maybe I only listened to amazing Maceo albums, but I doubt that everything I've hear from him was his absolute best.The solos on this album, are as good as they usually are. They're killin', but the actual song is more composition based rather then jam based. It is kind of a disappointment for me because I really love what Maceo does with his music, but maybe the 90's and 2000's stuff just isn't for me. It's a decent album, but I have definitely heard much better from Maceo."
5,The Craft Crystallized,"Ms. Bach has accomplished the near impossible in crystallizing the writer's craft onto a pin-head in this little jewel of a book.I've read close to fifty books on writing over the years, and I have yet to find one that so clearly, plainly, and most of all understandably, outlines what the craft consists of.In less than a hundred pages she hits every single important craft nail squarely on the head with a precise blow or two. She has done an outstanding job!It's a modern Wen Fun in its conciseness, and a concentrated Gardner in its pragmatism. I count myself lucky to have found it.Rowan Wolf"
4,Straightforward & Practical,"Written in a simple style that young people and beginning authors will be able to understand, this book also has some good tips for more experienced writers. There are many examples given to demonstrate the author's points and also excercises to reinforce learning. Definitely worth a read, especially considering it's free."
3,"Good guide, slightly flawed by typos","I found this article informative, and would consider it to provide good initial guidance for a beginner.It is for free (Amazon Prime) - which cannot be beat.Although this item is not a ""how-to-spell"" guide, I was slightly distracted by some errors like spelling, words missing from the middle of a sentence."
1,Non stAndard inflator connections,This model does not fit standard low-pressure inflators I have never seen a low-pressure inflator that this model will fit and have been in the scuba business for 25 years
1,Watch out,"I just ordered this game, I love the game but cant find the patches need to play it. What a waste of money.....:("
1,do NOT buy this!!!,"This movie is simply bad. I looks like some stupid high school project! The picture quality is terrible, and so is the sound. The riffs were refered to as #1, #2, #3, etc. I don't think this movie would be helpful to either a beginner or advanced guitarist. Each riff was only played twice, the instructor did not explain how to do them (what, they think we're going to look at the screen for a total of 10 seconds for each riff and learn it???), the film shows that the instructor did not have much rehearsing, and it's extremely boring. I didn't find this movie helpful what so ever."
1,this isn't complete,"It only shows you 1 or 2 riffs from the songs, not all the riffs and also the solos. I could have listened and found out all this video has to offer by ear. It is good if you are just starting out but if you are an intermediate or expert guitar player, don't buy it."
2,EXCELLENT PRODUCT,The product I recieved looked just like the picture. It shipped very fast and when the product wasn't exactly what my husband was looking for (he is kinda picky) The company had no problem with refunding my money. I reccomend the seller to anyone. Very easy to work with! Thanks a bunch!
3,Prototype Dolls for Sale,"What we have here is a legalized version of the long-available 'Back in the USA' bootleg, which features a large number of Dolls originals and covers, before they got into the studio with Sterling Morrison and Todd Rundgren for their two studio albums.Is it worth owning? Yes and no. I'd recommend almost anything the Dolls ever recorded (with exception to poorly recorded bootlegs), except that by and large, these are all rough demo versions of songs that are (here) played live, warts & all.The purists won't be blown away by this set, but it is notable for 'Seven-Day Weekend', and their cover of 'Great Big Kiss', which, had it been properly produced, would have been the monster single of the 70s, bar none. Look for a similar (but inferior, in my opinion) version on Johnny Thunders' solo effort ""So Alone."""
5,Excellent Book on Updike,"James Schiff's book on John Updike is the best I've read. Schiff seems to know everything about Updike, and his ability to discuss such a range of novels in so few pages is impressive. His chapter on Updike as a man of letters is a brilliant, well-researched, and eloquent argument for Updike's place as one of America's finest critics. In addition, he offers the finest criticism I've seen on The Poorhouse Fair, the Scarlet Letter novels, The Witches of Eastwick, Buchanan Dying, Memories of the Ford Administration, Brazil, and In the Beauty of the Lilies. His chapter on the Rabbit novels is also intelligent and articulate, one of the better summaries of that great multivolume achievement. All in all, Schiff's book is a must read for anyone interested in Updike."
1,"Very tight, narrow fitting and uncomfortable","The design is very beautiful, but wearing the shoes is quite another. For one, it's difficult to just slip them on without pantyhose. Even then, the fold in the front pressures top of feet b/c of the narrow space; the back fold produces an uncomfortable pressure into the back of feet. Lovely design but not made for human feet (perhaps due to non-leather/stiff materials used to make it)."
2,I can't stand this CD!,"I bought this CD because Alan Holdsworth plays guitar on it, and there's no denying he's one of the best. However, this is the classic result of pairing great ""guests"" on a jazz musician's album: It is the equivalent of elevator fusion. Musak. Not a moment of excitement or passion, just great musicians twiddling around. I was surprised that, after a couple of songs, they didn't ask themselves ""what are we doing?"" and just stop playing out of sheer boredom. One of those handfulls of CD's I've tried to listen to a couple of times and finally shelved away for good.I gave it 2 stars because the sound quality is good and some poeple may find it relaxing."
4,Under the Sun,"A great piece of work by MSO. The music is beautiful, relaxing and also intriguing. I enjoyed it very much."
1,It is not working plus disgusting,Received yesterday and started to use - it catches nothing but smell really disgusting. I don't know why the product receives so many 5 stars and it is really confused me. I have purchased hundreds of products from amazon and ebay - this is my first time to leave a 1 star review.
2,"Yes, it traps flies, but...","Well, these bags do LOOK like they work superficially. After all, you can see dozens of flies trapped inside crawling around. You might think, ""Wow! Look at all the flies that won't be coming in my house!""But, the thing is, the product is intended to be hung in a place where you have a fly problem, which means Something is attracting insects already. While the awful fishy smell from the bag does attract a number of flies and trap them, there are still a whole lot of other flies buzzing around outside of it. There don't seem to be LESS flies around because of the trap, but MORE because of the trap.Yes, it's kind of fun to see the captured flies crawling around inside, but when you think about it, there are billions of flies out there. Trapping 100 of them isn't going to make much of a difference. Personally, I'm going to try to find a way to repel them, rather than attract them!"
3,"Attracts flies, but not sure they are dying.",Lots of flies in the yard. The bag is obscured - cannot see if its working. I think I would try one that I can see next time.
3,fly trap,it really works but the smell is horible its hard to stand it so i had to trow it away and i think it attracts more flys
1,I would give it zero stars if I could,I overnighted two of these to deal with a crazy fly situation in my apartment. They didn't catch one fly. Not one. What solved the problem? Good old fashioned fly tape. Don't waste your money.
5,"Works as advertised, lets me keep the yard door open for my dog.",I didn't have a 'big' fly problem but there were enough flys in my area where keeping the back door open would allow an annoying amount of flys to buzz around. So instead of buying a screen door ( wont let my dog in and out as he pleases) I set up the trap in my back yard under a tree and sure enough after 3 days or so the fly's starting making this trap their home preferring it and their dead kin to my home. After 2 weeks as i type this there are are only one two flys that fly into in my home but go right back out to the trap and there are about 20 fly's actively in or around the trap still alive with a good 3 inch deep layer of dead flys. i would buy again
5,Works Good For Me,"I bought this product along with one of the Catchmaster glue sticks. I have cats at my house and during summertime, flies are attracted to their droppings and leftover food. I put the stick by the bird cage and the bags outside. They both seem to be working well. Both products arrived before scheduled dates and as described."
4,Stinking good product,"This product really does the job well. I have never seen so many flies congregate around something. It kills thousands of flies. The only drawback is the odor. I can never leave it up the maximum 30 days that it says because of the smell. So, when I can't stand it any more I take it down and put a fresh one up which doesn't smell that bad until about a week. This fly trap is easy to set up and take down. The odor is the only reason I took away one star. This product really does kill flies!"
4,Attracts the Flies,"We live near dairies so the fly problem is quite the challenge. Even these bags can't keep up but I'm not sure anything would. The smell isn't bad if you place them down wind and away from doors / windows. Have found these to be most effective when placed in areas that attract flies anyway: garbage cans, yard area where pets, etc. Because the fly population is overwhelming, these can't keep them all away but without them, the problem is much worse. Handle carefully, fill and place according to instructions, and they will fill with flies...nasty!"
5,Awesome for New Mexico area!,"When we first moved to new mexico the flies weren't very bad but once summer got going and apparently when farmers lay out the manure, the flies were horribly, these bags help so much. We had the smaller ones but there are so many flies we went with the bigger ones, I honestly cannot smell them unless I'm right next to it. We hung ours at the end of our back fence away from the porch and also in the front by our trash can, and it's helped out a lot. If you have fly problems I would get these!"
3,"Ineffective in the first week, OK after that, bad packaging","I was at first surprised other reviewers had so much luck with this trap. For more than a week several flies sunned themselves on the yellow part at any given time, but none descended through the funnel to take a dip in the refreshing brew fermenting in 90-degree sun. These weren't nuclear horror movie flies either... just plain house flies they'd fit if they gave it a try.After a week though they started going inside, and this thing wasn't something you'd want to get within 10 feet of because of the yeasty smell. And after about a month the bag was full of flies, and the liquid evaporated.The packaging is very tempting to cut through as if it were a bag with useful contents and some instructions you can read once you get the parts out. Don't: the bag IS the trap."
3,"Damned if I own it, damned if I don't.","This fly trap catches as many flies as the description says it will, and smells as badly as other reviewers says it does. The trap has caught hundreds of flies since I purchased it on July 12, 2012, and they swarm in and around it nonstop. I'm assuming our local fly population is excessive in the extreme, because I'm still being bombarded on my patio as I write this. The trap does not keep flies away from our patio or out of the house. Right now I have a fire burning in the fire pit during broad daylight because the trap is not adequate enough (I uploaded a photo). Honestly --- not even the smoke from the fire pit will keep them away.All I have to say is that if you have as many flies as we do, you're better off torching your neighborhood."
5,Works great!,"We have 4 large outside dogs, and when you have dogs...well, the poo attracts flies even if you pick it up every day. These traps do exactly what they say they will do, trap and drown flies. We were having a serious problem with biting flies, and it helps but doesn't completely get rid of them. However, I haven't had 1 fly in the house since we put them up.Use care when taking them down if they are still full of water. The bait stinks and will stick to skin like skunk. My husband still smells like fly bait and this happened 3 days ago. Overall though these work, and are easy to dispose of. A+ in my book."
2,Did not get the Horse Fly,"I bought this specifically try to trap and kill a horse fly that hangs around our deck and boat. The thing stinks like a very poor outhouse. I did see many small black flies inside, but I never saw the horse fly. Little rascal can't figure out how to get rid of this nasty horse fly. So, I guess if you want to catch little black flies this might be OK."
1,not working,"I had high hopes for this product, but it hasn't caught more than three flies in three days. The other fly catcher we got on Amazon has caught a ton. This bag just doesn't seem to be a very powerful attractant."
3,works too well,"I hung this by the side of my house and regretted it immediately. The smell permeated the wall and I forever had flies trying to get into the house looking for the source of the smell even weeks after I had moved the bag to the furthest reaches of my backyard. The smell lingered for a painfully long time, though I moved the bag after a day or two once I realized what was going on. The bag itself does FILL with flies, but I have to wonder if they came from my yard or from far away attracted to the smell."
4,Amazing Product....,"....but, boy does it stink! Like rotting flesh, to be exact. But that's what flies are drawn to. If you have a location that's fairly close to an area you want to clear of flies, yet downwind, you're in luck! I have it near my vegetable garden (northern Minnesota), and I can get eaten alive out there. This does the trick."
4,Beautifully illustrated catalog,"This exhibition catalog is beautifully illustrated, with many of the photographs extremely clear and all of very high quality. Most inscriptions are readable; larger objects are not just shown whole, but also in detail. It is a pleasure to see some many objects from Tanis included - King Tut has been over-exposed and the Tanis objects are less well-known.The introductory essays provide useful background information; the catalog item descriptions are useful but of varying depth."
5,Very nice book!,"Loaded with pictures, and an excellent book for turtle lovers. I bought this for my girlfriend and she really lofves it! Very educational!"
5,Sea Turtles...a great read,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The text was interesting, informative and understandable to the ""non-scientist"" reader such as myself. The photographs were beautiful. The bios of some of the diverse individuals working to save the turtles from extinction were inspiring. I also like the fact that Mr. Spotila is donating royalties to sea turtle conservation. It would truly be a shame if these ancient creatures disappeared from our world."
3,Gift for a friend,I bought this for a friend who is very much into & helps support a Lakota tribe. Smaller than expected.
4,Certainly good but...,"...getting too long. This was one of the most useful little books a med student could hope for, a really concise look into a single subject area. I used it for my 4th year elective, then the next edition for my Rheum rotation as a PGY-II, and then throughout Fellowship. I give the latest edition to each med student who rotates through our Rheum clinic, but I find they are less and less impressed by it as the size of the Primer approaches that of a textbook. The information is still excellent, but I think it's getting too big for the niche it has always occupied. If you really want that much info, buy the latest Kelley."
4,NICE BOOK WITH PRACTICAL ORIENTATION,"Embellished with colourful figures and tables, this ""Primer on the Rheumatic Diseases"" handled general rheumatology in way that would appeal to both clinicians and students. Its practical orientation include the diagnosis and management of all sorts of rheumatic disorders.It familiarizes its reader with the different patterns of disease progression, before offering diagnostic and therapeutic options. It is a fine book, whose coverage of physiotherapy and pain assessment are more than satisfactory."
4,Great Introduction!,"The Introduction is worth the price of the book. In the beginning of the book, the writer does a great job of introducing the reader to the Celtic way of sprituality. It is impossible to do justice to this section of the book in just a few words here. Suffice it to say that this one section of this one book is one of the best I've ever read as an overview to the way the Celtic person viewed the world and spirituality. The rest of the book is full of stories about numerous Celtic saints, and after following the great intro, was a bit of a let-down for me. Still,although I read this book three years ago, I have not forgotten how helpful this introduction was to my understanding."
5,Best Lives of Celtic Saints I've Read,This is the best lives of the Celtic saints I've read. The stories are shortered down and edited down slightly yet still in the same style and language translated right from Irish and Latin. I highly recommend it.
3,"Good, but...","The introduction is too popularized - ""buddy-Jesus"" etc. This is sad, since the lives presented in the book are really good. No foot notes / references, which is also a little annoying. Illustrations are absolutely horrible! Modern B/W art - why not Icons instead? It is a modern protestant book, introducing some of the Celtic saints. Concept is good apart from missing references and the illustrations, but it could get much better with little efforts."
1,Cut Short!,"This DVD had so many crucial parts cut out that I feel it was poorly edited and extremely cut DVD, which made this a waste of my money.I know parts were cut because it is a Novela that up until recently I was watching on my lunch hour, until they moved time slots. I was not able to watch it until I recently got a DVR.Natrully I watched the DVD I purchased from the beginning and realized all the cuts in what I consider important parts of the stroy line.Isn't there a full version?Also one of the DVD's was sliding around in the case when I got it in the mail because it was not secure and was scratched very badly but was still viewable.I am very dissapointed in this DVD and found it a poor buy.Thank you,A. Santana CT"
2,Bad Editing on a Beautiful Love Story,I loved this telenovela when it was broadcast on TV and finally looked it up recently and bought it. I have been so disappointed with how much was cut out of the DVDs. There were several times that I stopped the DVD player to check if I accidently skipped over any sections because events would be mentioned that were never shown. Sometimes it really didn't make sense. Wish I could buy the whole thing.
3,Amarte es mi pecado,"I think the novel was overall Good. I do agree with other reviews there were crucial parts that needed to be included. However, it kept me very interested on the scenes. I wished that the part were Mr Palacios daughter was hurt by the boyfriend were included I think it was important."
5,Love it,This necklace is really pretty. It doesn't look cheap at all. i truly love the length. It is not too long neither too short. Definitely love it!
4,Missing in Action,"As previously stated, in the 1st review, ""Heart Like A Wheel"" would have been a better choice than ""The Stake"". I think ""Going To The Country"", which was a minor hit, should also have been included. The majority of these tunes were big hits, easily recognizable and should, contribute to Steve Miller's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. His body of work has few peers. With ""Living in the USA"", ""Wide River"", ""My Dark Hour"" and ""I Want To Make The World Turn Around"", this collection gives fans a few added gems that show the quality of Steve's songwriting, which is much better than he is given credit for."
1,What A Drag!,"So along finally comes a CD looking like it might replace all my other Steve Miller hits albums. Not so, lot of funky choices in edits, missing parts of songs, hardly any liner notes to speak of and all kinds of errors in spelling and song titles. What a schlock job. This is NOT the kind of compilation that Miller deserves. All the Miller albums need to be remastered with bonus material and treated with respect, it's a great musical legacy that has been sorely served - this CD is a mess. And what's with the title and the cover photo???"
3,why do record companies consistently botch these things?,"i have been waiting for a 'complete' steve miller greatest hits for many, many years and this is a significant collection because it stands to replace one of the best-selling catalog albums ever. so why would they leave off the 1981 hit 'heart like a wheel', one of his only nine hits, when so many of the tracks on here could have easily been replaced? plus, there are no notes as to when these songs were released or which albums they came from. capitol records, if you can't do these things right, get some help from rhino!! even the album cover is a very unappealing b & w picture of mr. miller. at the very least, do not call something complete when it isn't (and you wonder why people download!)"
4,"""Take the money and run""...(record company).","I'm not the biggest fan, but when I think of summer barbeques and cold beer, I think ""Steve Miller Band"". He IS classic rock, and with a hundred bands upgrading their greatest hits in recent years, ""Steve Miller"" finally gets his. Remastered, and 8 tracks longer than his previous collection. This of course has the hits ""Rockin' Me"", ""The Joker"", and ""Jet Airliner"", plus songs like ""Abracadabra"" that have come out since. Also, at 22 tracks, it's one loaded single disc. So your choices are, to pass on this and ""Cry, Cry, Cry"", or get it right now and ""Dance, Dance, Dance""."
4,Macho City's missing!!!,"Hellow everybody, just want to say that this collection really rocks, remastering is good and the songs sounded loud. I really miss Keeps Me Wondering Why, Circle Of Love & Macho City on this one. This is the American release, so try to get the (our) European release because it has a bonus (limited) disc with 3 tracks on it: Winter Time, Keeps Me Wondering Why AND the long version of Macho City ... ;-) Good collection. Period."
1,The cd is unplayable was coast me one penny but I lost on shipping coast.,I purchase this CD because I was thinking they looking for a costumer they seel it for One penny so I 'm taking a change sure enough the CD was garbage I'will never again buy CD for One penny and from this seller.
3,"Yeah, All The Hits Are Here, But........","......the premature fade on ""Fly Like An Eagle"" is inexcusable. There is enough time left over on the cd to include it."
3,Jet Airliner Started It All,"This is ok, I rather hear Bob Seger insted!!! On this compilation, I haven't heard enough of Steve Miller's songs,the best song is Jet Airliner because it had some of the greatestopening riffs I have ever heard!! Other songs were great likeTake the Money & Run, Rockn Me, & Abracadabra. ""The Joker"" is theworst song I have ever heard. It is kinda the saddest true songever!! I may listen to this compilation eventully again butI rather hear Bob Seger, or Foreigner insted!!!!!"
3,ONLY IF YOU'RE REALLY YOUNG...........,"Well, this album has its ups and downs, I like Steve Miller, but I don't like his stuff butchered from the meat department. There is only one greatest hit compilation I like of his, and that's 'Anthology', I used to have this on vinyl, it was a double album set, that was pretty good, but it only covered 1967-1971 I believe. Anyways this album is missing a hell of a lot of good music like 'Your Saving Grace', 'Journey From Eden', 'Little Girl', well anyways it's o.k. if you want to dip your small toe in the water, but it doesn't even have the full version of Abracadabra, come on, stop teasing us."
4,Take the Hits and Run,"The Steve Miller Band's expanded greatest-hits package is far from complete when it omits the Top 25 single ""Heart Like a Wheel."" We're also stuck with shortened versions of ""Abracadabra"" and ""Swingtown."" On the plus side, we have the gloriously uncut ""Jet Airliner"" and early classics such as ""Livin' in the U.S.A."" With a little more effort, this could have been the definitive Miller collection. Nevertheless, the best tracks - ""Take the Money and Run,"" ""The Joker,"" ""Rock'n Me,"" ""Fly Like an Eagle,"" ""Jungle Love"" and the sadly overlooked ""I Want to Make the World Turn Around"" - remain essential."
1,UGLY!!!!!!I HATE IT!!!!!,THE ONLY DOLL I LIKE FROM THE ENTIRE Bratz World London Pretty in Punk COLLECTION IS YASMIN AND DYLAN!!!!! THIS DOLL IS SOOOOOO UGLY!
2,A disappointment.,"As another reviewer has observed, this game is prone to give your team a strike even when you answer correctly, but with a synonym. When the teams are tied at the end of a round, the ""virtual Louie Anderson"" still gives a message that indicates one of the teams is winning. This game needed a little more debugging before it was released to the public."
2,Survey says ----- Boooooo,"I was pretty disappointed. The big install had me expecting a lot, but they spent way too much on the appearance of Louie and the animation as it is just like you were watching tv, but your not, so don't. They needed to pay more attention to the answers you make, meaning they need to know you know the answer when you answer police and the correct answer is police officer, give me a break. It is slow between transitions like the others say, and the only thing I can tell you different from the rest is ""save your $20"". ....brizz"
3,FAMILY FUED,THIS ONE IS GREAT AND YOU MIGHT NEED THE BOOK THAT HAS ALL OF THE WORDS FOR SPELLINGGOOD LUCK AND HAVE FUN
5,Survey says...superb!,"Family Feud, just like the Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy! games from Hasbro Interactive, is simply excellent. The gameplay and sound effects are just like the current incarnation of the TV show. The animations are flawless. The option to create your own family is unique and produces reasonably good results. Louie Anderson is tolerable on this game, unlike the TV show where it sounds like he is close to screaming. Overall, it's a game I thoroughly enjoy and would recommend to anybody interested in purchasing it.I will offer these 2 caveats to anybody thinking of purchasing Family Feud: 1. If you have a slower computer, the game can act sluggishly. It was slow at times on my laptop (366 MHz, 32 MB RAM, 2 MB video card) while it ran flawlessly on my desktop (600 MHz, 64 MB RAM, 8 MB video card). 2. The full install is a gargantuan 600+ MB. While this shouldn't be an issue for consumers with newer computers, it is still worth noting."
5,"""The greatest songwriter you've never heard""","The title is not an exaggeration. Townes Van Zandt's work has been cruelly overlooked. He has written some of the most starkly beautiful songs you are likely to hear. This UK compilation features all of the major songs from the first phase of his career, including the relatively well known ""Pancho and Lefty"" and ""If I needed You"" Townes was a classic Texan songwriter, you can hear echoes of Hank Williams in his lyrics (although Townes does it better) and Lightnin' Hopkins in his guitar playing. If you have the slightest interest in music you have to own a TVZ album, no country/folk/blues collection is complete without one. This album is a bargain, buy it now and then buy all the others. They'll be friends for life."
5,Teapot,Works better than the 150.00 one I was replacing. The feet mean you dont need a hotpad and it holds a massive amount of tea. Only problem is it is heavy for one handed pouring when full.
4,Informative short book for all students,"As an engineering student I felt it would be a good idea to at least take a look at this book. Gladly I wasn't disappointed. The writer of this book is an actual professor herself and has years of experience to add. Topics covered include: taking good notes, test taking, problem solving, general class policy, staying up on lectures, lab write-ups and quite a few more. The chapters I found to be particularly helpful were the ones on keeping up with your notes from day to day, problem solving on tests and problem solving in general. If the book had just these three chapters it would be rather helpful. The only serious downside was that as a well seasoned college student 75% of the book was just listing things I already knew. Therefore I think those who would most benefit from this book are high school graduates. Being only about 80 pages it could be read over the course of a few days or a week."
5,Most accurate Ketone measurement,"I only use this for meauring ketones while striving for nutritional ketosis.I don't use the BGL monitor because i would have to recalibrate it when switching from ketone to BGL.Independant testing showed this brand to be the most accurate so that is whay I chose it.Downside is ketone strips are pricey, but worth the cost when compared to the cost of poor health."
5,A great book,"After reading this book, Roman history seems much more - real. It covers many aspects of the private life of a Roman citizen: The Family, The Name, Marriage and the position of Women, Children and Education, Dependents: Slaves and Clients, The House and Its Furniture, Dress and Personal Ornaments, Food and Meals, Amusements, Travel and Correspondence, Sources of Income and Means of Living, Burial Places and Funeral Ceremonies. Under each of these chapter headings is a list of specific sections and their paragraph numbers. (In the text, the paragraph numbers are placed on the outer edge of the page, so it is easily visible.) There are many illustrations (205, to be exact), which are very helpful, and it is not at all difficult reading."
3,Catholic 101,This examines how times have changed since most Christian churches stopped celebrating Chistmas in the 1960s. The focus topic is the Vatican II. 70 percent of Catholics live in third world countries in the southern hemisphere below the Equator. The focus is on the one God. A fine book on the world's most popular faith.
2,The concept is a good one...,"A friend gave me one of these to try at the gym when I told her I couldn't stand to choke down anymore water. It is very good however I started getting a headache shortly afterwards, which only happens after I've ingested an artifical sweetner. Unfortunately the sweetner in this product is sucralose, the chemical found in Splenda. For that reason I won't use this product again."
5,Awesome Stuff!,My kids love this stuff. Water is so much better for them than everything else out there. We can't keep it in the house. I highly recommended it.
1,Its not all natural,"This product uses a synthetic sugar. It may taste good, but so does anything that is sweet. Why use an artificial sweetner?"
2,Chemically!,"I wanted a light and refreshing strawberry-kiwi individual serving to replace the Wyler's I can't find anymore, but this is not it. Although it isn't a strong flavor, there's a definite unpleasant chemical aftertaste. I'm giving boxes away or mixing it with stronger fruit-punch flavors to get rid of it and *really* wishing I had saved my money. Even using a grocery coupon, this wasn't worth the price."
3,Fairy good product,"I was more disapointed in the shipping package from amazon than this product! Whomeever packs some of these things needs to go back to Packing a package 101!!! There was white powder all over the box from one of the lids coming off!!!!!!!! YES! The postmaster held it and waited for me to pick it up, thinking it was either hazardous or dangerous!! Good grief!!!! The sinks are doing better, however!"
4,Bait and Switch,Do not order this item under the subscribe and save and think you are going to pay $54.98 (85% of the $64.68). The subscription is based on the Amazon price of $86.19. Total rip off.
2,Did not notice any difference,I took most of the bottle and did not notice any difference when taking this product. Would not order again. Since we are different your experience may be different.
3,knee and ankle complaint,I was told this might help. It's been three weeks. I take them as I'm supposed to. If no change after another four or five weeks I won't buy it again. If it helps and I start skipping around the garden I'll let you know. Wish me freedom from the aches that started for no apparent reason.
5,Great Stuff,I've used this for several years to reduce the joint pain and stiffness in my hands and knees. It has worked beyond my expectations.
4,Reviews of Cosamin DS,"I'm taking Cosamin DS 3 times a day per my doctor for knee pain and other joint pain. I have had considerable relief. My knees no longer go snap, crackle, pop when I get up from sitting. I'm continuing with this for the next few months at least since my doctor says I need to get it 4 months before deiciding how totally effective it is. For now, I'm pleased with the product and what it has done for me!"
4,Best ever Arthritis relief,"When I was diagnosed with Osteo-Arthritis I could barely get up a flight of stairs without clutching the railing to assist me. Since taking this product, I'm back to walking and biking and can easily go up and down stairs. I feel it's given me a new lease on life!"
5,A must have for sore joints,"I cannot recommend this product more highly! Two orthopedic surgeons and my dog's vet all recommended specifically this brand of glucosamine. The vet even did her own MRI studies on dogs with this brand versus others and found better results with Cosamin than grocery store brands (dogs don't benefit from the placebo effect).The packaging and my doctors all recommended taking a larger dose the first few months and then tapering it down, but I've found that anything less than 3 a day leaves me sore within a couple of weeks. I do a lot of trail and hill running here in Colorado, so I probably do more damage than the average person.Cosamin costs a little more, especially at higher doses, but it is 100% worth it. I've tried 8 different brands and this is by far the best for me."
4,Swimmer's shoulder,"This product is not really meant to aid with swimmer's shoulder. Swimmer's shoulder is an inflammation of tendons in the shoulder, and increase in cartilage would not aide that problem.While the Cosamin does not aide in swimmer's shoulder, I have taken it after knee injuries with minor improvement in recovery time.If you are looking for something to aide in the recovery after a joint injury, this product may help, but that is not the intended purpose of the product."
3,This product is hard to evaluate,This product is hard to evaluate as the results do not happen very quickly and there are some many additional factors to it proving helpful.
5,Only brand that works for me.,"For three years I took Schiff's, then Members Mark (Sam's Club own brand), and finally NOW, and the pain in my knees got to be excruciating. I couldn't take a step without cringing. After reading the reviews for this brand I gave it a try. I am astonished at its efficacy. The very next morning the pain was gone. I gardened all day and the next morning there was no pain either. If you are about to give up on glucosamine, don't, give this brand a try instead."
4,DS Cosamin Nutrient for joint Benefit,"Delivered on time as expected, in good condition. I have been using this product for a couple of years and I feel as though it is doing exactly what it is supposed to be doing. Prior to using it I experienced Knee discomfort when sitting for an extended period of time. now,with taking this nutrient I no longer have that problem. perhaps when you age into your mid 70's as I have you may have some discomforts but it is nice to have them eliminated at this time. My thanks to DS Cosamin."
4,Very satisfied overall,"I received the correct product and it was shipped quickly. The Supplemental Facts displayed for this product are a bit different from the actual product received, but the main ingredient dosages and capsule quantity are what I ordered. I anticipated a discrepancy based on the Supplemental Facts I found for this product at other vitamin shop sites. What I received has the identical Supplemental Facts label as shown for this product at any reputable vitamin shop. This vendor is probably displaying an outdated label which is the only reason I rated 4 stars instead of 5. The product I received has an expiration date of 05/2014 which indicates a fresh product. I would order from here again."
3,back order,"The item was on back order. I wish they would let you know that because I could have bought some elsewhere so I wouldn't have run out.Thank you,Beverly"
1,dirty drug,"Inside the bottle of DS Joint Health Suuplement, the capsules were all covered with dust. Quality controls on this product were apparently inadequate."
2,Compared to CVS,"I checked an equivalent product at CVS, They have a Double Strength version that has 1500mg of Glucos. and 1200mg of Chondr. The bottle size was 180 and the price was in the 30's. Seems like a better deal at CVS"
5,"""Doctor Recommended""",Recommended by our orthopedic surgeon as the only glucosamine product upon which you can rely. The only product thoroughly tested by the U.S. government.
5,Got rid of 100% of my knee pain,"About 8 years ago I damaged both knees in a fall. Two days after falling, I was in agony when I walked. Sometimes couldn't even finish a trip to the grocery store due to pain. (Before the fall, I was pain-free and exercised daily.) Finally went to an ortho. doctor who said the cartilage was damaged and he recommended Cosamin DS. I started out with 3 per day for a week or 2, and could notice pain relief in about 5 - 7 days. Then went down to 2 per day for a few more weeks. All of the knee pain was gone after a couple weeks. Have been taking only 1 per day since then, and it keeps the pain away. If I forget to take it for more than two days in a row, I do feel the knee pain coming back."
4,Great pictures!,"This book is great for ideas - the entire book is photographs with paragraphs describing the plants in those photos. The photos show examples of how others have used their grasses to landscape, and it provided me with great ideas. Highly recommended if you want ideas of all kinds of ways to use ornamental grasses, both in flower beds and especially in your landscape."
1,Poorly written,The book is more like a speech than a real book one can read. The authos is not qualifiend to talk about the subject matters he attempts to talk about.
4,Not just another gay book,"Even though this is a mystery about a groom gone missing from a gay wedding, it is way more than that. There is comedy, supense, plot teases and more. Excellent read from a first time author. I hope he goes on to write more about Russell Quant and make it into a series of books, It was wonderful to read another gay themed book (like Mysterious Places... Mysterious Dreams) without all the stereotypical gay stuff. This was just a damn good mystery that happens to be about gay people."
4,Another terrific Russell Quant mystery,"This was the third of the Russell Quant mysteries I read. The second one was ""Tapas on the Ramblas"", which took place on a cruise ship, and as I had just finished a Mediterranean cruise, it was very easy to put myself into the story. Each of the books was a new adventure and this one was another new and exciting adventure. I actually feel like I know personally a lot of the characters, especially Russell. And I've learned so much about a part of Canada that I knew nothing about. When I finished this one I couldn't wait to get on to the next one.The writing is so good."
2,Slow Boat To Nowhere,"Boring. Anthony Bidulka has a chatty, readable style that added a second star to my rating. But the characters are dull, the narrative is rambling, and the actual mystery is pure Murder She Wrote. There are a couple lightly sexy bits, but there's no payoff there, either. I'd maybe pass this on to my grandma, but I couldn't recommend it to anyone else I know."
5,Amuse Bouche,"Bidulka's Amuse Bouche is an effervescent first novel that is much like the tasty French hors d'oeuvres from which it takes its name. It's an amusing, entertaining, and sometimes titillating story with a lively supporting cast of characters. Bidulka's given us just enough details about his queer P.I. to keep us interested in his adventures but leaves room for developing Quant into a more fleshed-out hero in future mysteries.What really stands out here is the subtle way that Bidulka comments on the ordinary lives of the gays and lesbians in Russell's world. Bidulka touches on a variety of serious issues - how homophobia keeps gays and lesbians in the closet, the tension of family relationships, same-sex marriage, outing - while neatly weaving these strands into an engaging mystery. This is a good start to an exciting new mystery series."
4,Organize MY Family? ...,"In desperation, I turned to ""Organize Your Family...Simple Routines For You and Your Kids"". I am an incredbly left brained person and orgnization comes somewhat naturally. My daughter is extremely right brained. The problem is comunicating my ideas into something she can understand and follow. Not as easy as one might think. This book saved her life and my sanity. There are a lot of books on the shelves, but they deal mostly with desks, files and grown-up stuff. Our goal was to teach organization now so that she can accomplish more in life. The book was easy to follow and broken up in to easy-to-refer-back-to categories. We still have a ways to go, but we have put some of the tecniques into practice."
4,Don't get one of these if you have a ferret,"Great product, it's just that my ferret keeps digging out all of the food in it. It does what it is intended to do, so no fault to the product."
5,Aaronic Priesthood through the Centuries,"Even though this is an older publication, the research is timeless and facinating. I love this book."
5,"Fun story, many more hours of fun just exploring the art!","This is a new twist on the types of stories that kids love to read and hear over and over. It begins with a lady making a simple request...she just wants her apple. The chain of events that results though, teaches cause and effect in a fun way. What really makes the book a lasting treasure is the art work. We found ourselves going through the book both from front to back and back to front just exploring the colorful and playful art. I highly recommend this book for kids or even adults who like the playful prose and pictures. Two thumbs up for Mary Rose Santiago and Idries Shah. I look forward to seeing more of their works."
3,good tech. book,"I guess if your looking for a purely tech. imformitivive book,or a book to modify your Corvette or Camaro, this is the book for you.I wanted more info. on swapping engines into older vehicles,thats why I did'nt find the book that helpfull."
5,Wonderful,this is an amazing vibrator! I had my first g spot orgasm with it! The angle is PERFECT for g-spot and clitoral orgasms. great for beginners to experts :)
4,"""Falling in Love..."" is Wonderful","Ray Charles wanted to highlight Jimmy Scott's ballad ability, and he does here. What keeps this CD from being rated 5 stars is that there is not much variation in tempi. Otherwise, Scott's ability to get inside a ballad and make it his own is exemplary. The title cut, for example, is the most moving version of this song I have ever heard and I think is the strongest cut. Charles' piano complements and, in fact, comments a bit on the lyrics and there is some great byplay between the vocalist and pianist. The stereo mix is a bit extreme (The mono mix might present a more coherent image, but you might lose Charles' piano, by himself, out in the left channel).This is thoroughly enjoyable and it's great to see it re-released."
1,"sad, sad, sad",This ...!! The new song is terrible. The band was and will always be the line-up on 'Voracious Contempt' and the godly 'Extinction of Benevolence'. That was the best w/crushing guitars and brutal and monstrous vocals. They should give it up and should stop trying to bring back their old glory. Have Frank sing on a new release so he can inject that old IB into you all. Bunch of ... ... goofballs w/stupid haircuts now.
1,Rehashed trash,"All these guys have done was repackaged their old demos, put 1 new song on this cd and try and sell it. This is terrible!!! The new singer is awful and they just got another new singer to replace the guy who sings on this 1 new song. They were the gods of Long Island back when Hobbie, Miola and their amazing singer Frank Rini was in the band. How anyone would want to stay in a band w/egomaniac and poster boy for narcissism guitarist, Chris Pervelis, is beyond me. I saw them at the Roxy all the time and this guy thought he was the coolest and turned out to be a backstabber and talked crap about other bands and even band members, Rini and Hobbie when they left to pursue better things in life."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A couple of detectives have a very difficult and horrifying puzzle tosolve. They have to work out which of several bodies a demon isinhabiting. First, you have to work out how to tell, and then how toprove it. Not to mention what do you actually do it about it when youfind it.Lots of corruption of priests abounds here, fairly amusing some of it."
5,What a book.,Richard Paul Evans has a way with words. I loved this book and found it to be a good book to relax with.
5,Review,I read all of this author's books. I was pleased to get such a good price and fast shipment on this one. Would highly recommend.
4,A Lovely Book,"I have had this book around for awhile. I had read ""The Christmas Box"" years ago from this author and that is why I picked this book out at a used book sale. It just didn't grab me for some reason - in fact I thought it was a book of devotionals or something like that - it must have been the way the book is packaged - not standard size and being a used book, it didn't have a dust jacket. I finally picked it up to read casually and was eventually absorbed into the story. I loved the quotes from Michael Keddington's Journal at the beginning of each chapter. The ending was quick without much dialogue but at least it was a happy ending. I felt peaceful after reading the book."
3,good,"Though I must admit the story was poignant and I agree that life is like a carousel at times, it left me unsatisfied... This is the first book I've read of Evans, and he's a good author, but at times I was left hanging and wondering...it felt like a soap opera episode... It's a decent read, though, and the publishing company did a really good job designing his books, so don't be surpised if you're drawn to this book."
3,A nice story!,"This was my first experience reading Evans. I enjoyed the story line, and the character, and found them believable. Sometimes it is easy to see ""fiction"" as being fantasy, but this story was one that could happen. The story didn't make my favorites list, but it was fine."
5,A Modern Love Story You Will Long Remember,"This uplifting novel chronicles the love story of Michael Keddington and Faye Murrow, two characters we first met in ""The Locket."" They discover that life is what happens when your dreams don't come true, that everyday pressures and pains may take their toll on love, and it is up to the individuals to make love survive.Michael and Faye face parents opposed to their union, separation, teen depression, suicide, abortion, child abuse, terminal illness, and most every stumbling block known. The choices they make, good and bad, are part of the tapestry of their lives, the ties that can destroy them or bind them. When Michael says of his love ""I have found home,"" and Faye wrestles with how to heal herself emotionally, the reader will be drawn into their lives. Evans' easy-going, conversational prose style is inviting and you will be glad you had a chance to share Michael and Faye's life with them."
1,Boring,"I can't believe anyone would give this five stars. It is kind of ""Mickey Mouse"" and has all been said before. Very predictable. Not much imagination. Liked some of his other books but this one is a real bore."
1,Predictable,"If I could give this book 1/2 star or no star, I would. The book is simplistic, predictable, and boring. Do not waste your money or time on this read."
5,"Strong Characters, Good Read","The story is fairly simplistic, but I really was impressedby the excellent character development which made the booka very entertaining read. It is harder to develop complexcharacters within a simple storyline. When it is done well,as in this instance, it results in characters which seem tooutlive the book and follow you around in your headfor a couple of days. I would definitely recommend this book."
3,An inspirational love story......,"Michael and Faye are young lovers who decide to marry before going their seperate ways to college. There are many trials they go through regarding faithfulness, a runaway wife & child, an unexpected pregancy, a death in the family and so much more. Mr.Evans weaves all these elements into this tale of inspirational love. These are people the reader can relate to and feel for what they are going through. This is a charming little novel and would make an excellent TV movie."
4,Great!,The book was fantastic! My mom even liked it and she is a hardcore sci-fi and fantasy fan. Not sure what my brother said he never said anything about it but he never says anything but HARRY POTTER. Anyway hope to see book 2 coming soon.
5,Quick Delivery,Very happy with the book. It came in when it was supposed to and was in excellent shape!
4,"Not bad, not bad","Prose Combat is a decent album. I listened to Solaar's first record before I heard Prose Combat and I enjoyed it more. Musically, Qui Seme Le Vent is more creative and interesting in terms of beat and instruments. Prose Combat's beats are a little less well synchronized with the rap -- he's still got spirit but the music doesn't support it well. I recommend springing for Solaar's first album first. If you like that then go for Prose Combat, listen to it a few times and you'll probably end up very happy with it."
4,Pretty good overall,"This album is pretty good. Its my first MC Solaar album, and I really like a few of his songs. It really has that 90's sound to it, which I like to an extent. I would definitely consider getting more of his albums, as I really like his sound."
1,PURE TRASH,"Anyone who invests money is this CD needs to be admitted to a MENTAL WARD...the only reason I gave this WACK project 1 star was because that was my last option...he conveys in french, and I can see why, because he's not saying anything worth listening to...SOLAR NEEDS SOME SUN...when TRASH day comes, make sure Solar is a part of it...once you go WACK, you neva come back, lol....this CD is a REAL SLEEPER (ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ)"
5,Phenomenal,"This is one incredible recording from an amazing talent. The beat is perfect, and this is simply the most elegant rapping in existence. Makes me want to learn the French language."
1,"Ridiculous, unverifiable claims",None of these methods are scientifically proven or even tested. All we have to go on are the dubious testimonies of people claiming that they cured stage 4 cancer with some seaweed.I urge anyone who is in a dire health situation to reconsider the advice of charlatans.
2,Little Help in Marienbad,"I've struggled to understand this ""classic"" film. It hits on some visceral level, but is largely incomprehensible. Unfortunately, (I hate to start a sentence with ""unfortunately,"" but have no choice here), this book is as incomprehensible as the film. I'm no closer to understanding the film after reading it."
2,Not a memorable effort.,"The author attempts some clever story-telling devices with his life-as-imagined-on-video technique,but the gimmics get in the way of the narrative. The 17-year-old protagonist carries some baggage into young adulthood, but I'm not sure readers who might identify with that ""baggage"" will stay with the story.Maybe I'm just an old-fashioned guy ""reader.""Two stars."
3,"Great Magazine, Except for John Venarri","John Venarri is a freemason who has infiltrated the tradionalist movement. For the sole purpose to divide us. Think of this, a bishop said, ;We must abrogat Vatican 11. And then immediatly abrogate the council of Trent. Our lord said to Peter ;He who hears you, hears me, he who rejects you rejects me;."
5,"If you love Homeworld, get one this too!!!","Again, great graphics and lots of challenge. If you like Homeworld get this game too."
3,Not terribly exciting,"After purchasing Homeworld (for a great price... always wait until the ""Game of the Year"" goes on sale for a great deal), I natually felt inclined to try Cataclysm. What a mistake.The whole beautiful ""space is a large, lonely place"" premise has been completely manhandled with foolish commentary. The music and sound effects are trite. The ships are still huge, but a lot of the ""improvements"" or other enhancements seem visual or unnecessary.The fact that ""Barking Dog Studios"" (never heard of them) places their logo on the pause screen helps to solidfy the fact that Sierra and Relic seemingly don't want to touch this one. I'm hoping that Homeworld 2, being developed by the Relic team, is a closer match to the awesome original."
3,"Okay, but I liked the original better","Okay, so this game has a great plot and excellent story line. But the graphics are lacking. The first Homeworld game did a great job but this one was like a step back. Don't get me wrong, I liked the game, it's just not as good as I expected."
1,Boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo,"I loved the origanal so I had high exspectations. The graphics are phenominal, but the gameplay sucked. I finished it in a week. Unlike the original that took me the whole summer. If you want the a good game buy the original."
5,love it!,Love the product!! Needed one for the second bathroom. Washes well - easy to care for and no yucky smells!
3,Hookless Shower Curtain,"I really like this product, but it does tend to need to be washed a lot because mold grows on the bottom. The mildew resistance really doesn't help.The one thing I like is the top is open so you aren't in the shower with no light and the fact that you can wash it."
2,Color is off,"Beige is not beige, it's a creamy, butter yellow. Not what I expected, disappointed in knowing I'll have to wrap everything back up and take the time and energy to send it back and start searching again. Sigh."
3,upper panel is sheer,"this is a nice shower curtain in that it is light weight, very easy to place on the shower bar. the upper sheer panel is very sheer, there isn't anything that keeps the water from splashing out. anyone who is tall can't help but splash water out as they raise their arms. if the water spray hits it directly, it will go thru the panel. although it's working out, for the most part, I wouldn't buy another one like it."
2,hookless mystery blue,This item showed up in the wrong color (all light blue rather than two tone) twice. Not as pictured!
2,"Bad, bad colors","The sage and beige are terrible just like a couple of other reviewers have reported. The sage has far too much yellow. The beige is a pinkish beige. In my house these colors don't go well with anything! Too bad, they look like they should work OK."
3,Love it but...,"I really love the hookless shower curtains. I replaced one that had a plastic window with this one that has a fabric window. My only complaint is that the fabric window leaks water during a shower. Next time, I will get one without the window."
4,Quality,"I purchased a few in different colors and these are a very nice purchase, glad I did as well as everyone else. Would definitely recommend to anyone. The only down side if you can call it that is the fixed length on all colors. So make sure the adjustment is for 'length' also width! :-)"
3,"Well made, but colors are not accurately described","I ordered this product in Sage color, but it did not seem to be ""sage"" at all. It didn't look like the photo on Amazon's website. Instead, it was more like a soft pistachio color -- too much yellow. The quality seemed very good however. I returned it and ordered the same thing in Beige. But that had the same problem. The Beige was more like a pale pink or peach color. That's going back as well. Too bad, because it seems like a good product."
4,Recommended!,I love this shower curtain! it goes on so easily and looks nice and I especially like the sheer panel at the top so you can see out and it feels much more open and less claustrophobic.
3,Okay not Great,I was a little disappointed as the hookless rings have left rust on my shower ring. Will not order again.
3,Mystery Shower curtain,Easy to install and looks great. The magnets on the bottom of each end of the curtain keeps it place. No more worries about anyone pulling the curtain and broken shower rings. I like this product a lot and would recommend it to others without hesitation
4,Great Fan,"We installed this fan in our kitchen near the stove and it has been perfect. No vibration, perfect fit and attractive to look at."
5,Sweet,"This fan was easy to install and it is incredibly quiet. I would recommend it to any one who needs a good quiet fan It also has a balancing kit that came with it, we did not have to use the kit but it was nice to have it available. We purchased it for the kitchen where we needed it to be some what invisible and it blends in beautifully."
3,A little disappointed,"I have purchased other Hunter fans in the past but was disappointed to discover that this one makes a slight buzzing noise when it is operating. It probably won't disturb most people when it is in a bedroom but I am very sensitive to noise and it definitely bothers me. However, it does work well in a smallish bedroom."
3,"Nice, not great","This is a pretty nice fan. After having bought a hunter flush mount a few years ago I had higher expectations though. It looks nice, but has a very cheap feel to it. The housing cover does not mount flush to the ceiling, there is about a half in gap. The 2 wood screws that are supposed to hold the ceiling mount both snapped while trying to screw them into the stud. The screws and such are probably the cheapest screws Hunter can buy.The fan is quiet though, with the lowest setting being truely low, it's probably something like 100-120 RPM, and the slowest I've ever seen a fan."
2,Not enough cooling breeze,"I bought this fan in 2011 for a 10'x12' bedroom in the southwest corner of the house. It replaced a 25+ year old four blade fan of the same size, but the new fan just didn't push enough air to keep the room comfortable in warm weather. The top speed on this fan matched the medium speed on the Hunter Quiet Breeze 44"" fan I installed in another bedroom in 2012. I decided to upgrade to the 52"" Low Profile fan, and its motor and five larger blades cool the room more efficiently."
4,good compact fan,This was perfect for a low ceilinged space. Very quiet and unobtrusive. Did not install myself so don't know about ease of installation. Good price and service from Amazon.
3,What happened to Hunter?,"I grew up with Hunter fans. My father swears by them. No other brand has ever been acceptable in our house. Naturally, when I bought my new house, I chose Hunter without question. I was very disappointed to see that the quality of the fans is not at all like it used to be. I felt like I could snap the blades and the brackets in half with ease.I installed them anyway and they are very quiet but I am afraid that any minor bump into them would be catastrophic.Please go back to the quality that helped establish your name years ago."
5,This is a great product,This is a great product! It's quiet and moves the air. My electrician was very empressed and said it was the quietest one he has ever seen and wanted to know where I got it! I would recommend this product!
4,"Very nice fan, minor installation challenge","This fan was a great value. It's very nice looking and is the perfect size for the two small bedrooms (11 by 11 and 10 by 14) we installed it in. It has several speeds and is very quiet at all of them. The one challenge is that the recommended installation left a one inch gap between our ceiling and the fan collar. We removed the cushioned spacers and that cut the gap in half, but there is still a gap there. You'd never notice it if you just walked into the room, but it bothered me when I installed it."
1,Not as advertised,"Purchased this item for four-season patio, based on it having ""plastic"" fan blades. It says this right it the product name as shown on Amazon. The fan blades are in-fact MDF, and will not work in an environment where any moisture or dew may form.I usually find Amazon's items to be as-advertised, so this is not typical of them. Unfortunately, this item is not and amounted to a waste of my time and money."
3,No Light kit,I bought 2 other Hunter Fans 52in that had a light kit. The deal was better on the 52's because after purchasing a kit for the 42 in it ended up costing more then the 52's. If you have the space buy the 52in
3,gap too large,Fan motor cover leaves 1/2 inch between cover and ceiling. Older model fit much closer to ceiling giving better appearance.
5,Hunter Lowprofile Bedroom Fan,"With only 7' ceilings, my wife and I never thought we could have a ceiling fan in our master bedroom. This was without a doubt the hottest room in our house as it was the farthest away from the AC unit. Then we found the Hunter 23866 Lowprofile fan online. We debated and after reading its specs.. decided to go for it. I installed in a few hours and we have been really enjoying our now 'cool' room. We both now sleep so well! Thank you Hunter."
4,As advertised and well worth the money.,"Almost silent in the fist two speeds and does what it is supposed to do; circulate the air. Only 3 speeds, and I am kida stuck using the first 2 as the high speed creates too much fan noise in my theater room for my taste; wish there were 4 speeds. Looks good and the install was easy. Maybe should have gotten a bigger fan to move more air at a lower speed, althouh I really don't regret the purchase as the look and price were right. The low profile is perfect with an 8 foot ceiling."
5,Perfect for Florida lanai.,Lightweight and smooth running perfect for lanai ceiling that can't take much weight. Big difference in comfort.
5,Very nice fan!,"I replaced an old, broken fan with this one. It was fairly easy to install, once we worked out a small kink (that had to do with our ceiling, not the fan). Being close to the ceiling and only 42"", it doesn't move as much air as some of our other fans, but I knew this when I bought it. Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase, and would buy this fan again if I need another low-profile, smallish fan."
1,"Fan does not sit flush on ceiling, not as small as advertised","I purchased this product specifically because of the low profile size for a room with a ceiling height of only 7'6"". I am very disappointed-upon installing the fan it does not sit flush against the ceiling (not due to a curved ceiling, rather due to the hanging bar provided with the fan). there is a 1/2-1"" gap between the housing the ceiling, and the fan hangs lower than the advertised 8"".I would not recommend this fan to anyone.As we took it down right after mounting it I cannot comment on the performance, or noise level."
1,Product Description is Wrong,"The description for this product is wrong. This fan cannot be used in ""enclosed outdoor locations"" as specified in the description. It is not UL certified for wet locations and Hunter will not honor the warranty if is used anywhere other than an indoor location. According to Hunter, this fan is not suitable for use in an enclosed porch, for example."
1,Hunter fan was defective & Amazon has not emailed me about return,"We normally love Hunter ceiling fans. They stay quite and are great for years.But.....this one was defective, the center part of motor hangs crooked which makes the fan rub and make noise when it is on.I have requested a replacement and the request said I would be notified by Amazon Customer Service and it has been 5 day and have heard NOTHING from them. Maybe this will get a response.I have found NO WAY to contact Amazon via email or any other way, so I am wondering if purchasing from Amazon was a mistake??????What to do??????Please get back to me if you read this.ThanksRenee'"
1,For the Price You Can Do Much Better,"Maybe this doesn't deserve one star... after all, this book is fairly well organized and doesn't seem to have been written with a crayon. On the other hand, I do recommend not buying this book. It isn't terribly informative or helpful and, though not written in a ghastly fashion... one may well expect better from a professional. Also... the book costs something like three million dollars (well, over sixty... but still a lot!) and for that kind of money you want an excellent book, not something that's just simply passable."
5,Best can opener around !,"Back in my Army days, I used one of these all the time. We needed them for our rations. These are strong and seem to be just as good if not the same. I prefer one of these over a can opener."
5,Great things come in small packages,"I heard stories of these from my dad who was in the war. So i decided to grab them for my ""Get out of Dodge"" bag. These things are super easy to use and take up absolutely no space. Great buy!"
1,False advertising,"The product description states that these openers are made from ""the same folks who supply them to Uncle"" and perform ""much better than the Asian knockoffs"". It's a roundabout way of saying ""Made in USA"" -- or so I thought.The five pack I purchased (sold by MARSALES CO and fulfilled by Amazon.com) were NOT Shelby Co. P-38s. In fact, they were not made in America at all. Peeling the vendor's sticker off the packaging revealed a ""Handcrafted in China"" label underneath. Whether the vendor purposely placed their sticker to hide the product's origin I do not know. All I know is that I've been cheated out of five bucks.The openers do work, but bend easily. They are flimsy compared to the Shelby Co. openers I've used. Take the vendor's advice and avoid this ""Asian knockoff""."
1,"Cheap, not for survival kits",Do not get stuck out in the wilderness relying on these cheap knockoffs. Best to spend a few more bucks on ones that won't easily bend during use.
2,too small to be used,Very disappointed. Maybe I did not read the product description with enough attention but these are so small that they are barely useable. I guess they're great if you go on extreme outdoor adventures where very ounces of weigh counts.
2,Too small & not sturdy,"Got this because while traveling in south america i saw at a supermarket this nifty can opener with similar concept but much better than the one here. I am fed up with the standard can openers which have these rotating parts which cannot be properly cleaned/dissinfected.It is cheap. It might be used for emergency purposes. It is too small and bends out of shape after a few uses. I went to a local asian supermarket where i found a stronger can opener with non rotating parts (nor sharp parts for that matter, but works great somehow)."
1,Break Easy,"These are supposed to be a P-38 can opener (military calls it this). The P-51 version is same thing except larger and more durable. Skip the P-38 purchase and buy the P-51 can opener (search for ""P-51 can opener""). I found the P-38 bends too easily, and too little mechanical advantage. You use as follows: Place the long, flat part against the side of the can and the blade on the top edge of the can. Hold firmly while pressing down and rock back and forth. With a little practice you might decide to throw away your large, clunky mechanical or electrical can opener."
4,Outstanding first book,"I was blown away by this outstanding book. It is so well written, that I journeyed along with Kate in her downward alcoholic spiral and felt her every emotional upheaval. Kudos to Patricia Tiffin on her first book."
2,was not a compartment kit like stated but a cheap tuperware kit,This did not include the compartment kit but was a cheap tuperware holder filled with two sandwich bags of items. Looks like it is an unprofessionally put together kit.
2,you could build this one yourself,Just a lock-it box filled with first aid elements. You can buy the same things at the market and build this kit for half the price. Not impressed. Overpriced.
1,I never received my poster,"I purchased a movie poster. It was sent to me via purolator and when they attempted to deliver the poster the first time I wasnt home. They left a tag I could sign if I wasn't going to be home and if I choose to sign it they could leave the package behind. I did so. When i got home that day that tube was sitting there for me. I open the tube to find an only a packing slip in it. I signed for nothing!!! I am currently disputing the charge now with Amazon and my credit card company to get reimbursed for the poster I never received, but signed for! Another headache to deal with! Just what everyone needs!"
2,Not advisable,"This book was very, very, basic. Basically focused on conditioning as injury prevention, but with no real details, just the basic concept that fit players are better players....amazing breakthrough. As a women's coach, I found his reaction to his players injuries a bit sexist as well.Too specific about what the author's limited experience during a short stint at a small school, where prolongs the short chapters with stories and names of his former players, and even has the audacity to quote himself multiple times, cleverly using his initials or quoting ""stan"" as opposed to ""N. Stanley Nahman.""If you're entirely new to rugby and want some guidance? Google ""rugby the rookie primer"" by Lisa Gartner, which Nahman recommends in the book.If you're thinking of buying this book to help you as a coach, look elsewhere. There are plenty of great coaching manuals out there, ones that are advanced enough to do without a glossary for words such as ""backs,"" ""Line-out,"" and ""Try."""
5,BonJour La Fromagerie Boxed Cheese Knife Set,"This is an excellent price for the quality of the merchandise, a terific product for the hard to buy person"
3,Are some of the words a barrier to book's enjoyment....,"Even though Amazon.com suggests this book for ages 4 to 8, I have some reservations. There is terminology of fables (i.e., sorcerer, basilisk, undine, centaur) throughout the story. I wonder if this age group can fully understand and appreciate the story's intent."
2,Typical Cherry-Picking,"Gossip's book is moderately pleasantly written for the average Christian looking for a warm feeling, but it falls victim to the typical cherry-picking of religious books. Gossip chooses all the scripture that supports his arguments with no mention of the terrifyingly misogynistic and bigoted passages that disagree. Gossip interprets the story of Jesus Christ in the way that makes him feel best."
1,Cleopatra/Anarchy botched this one up...,"O.K. I made the mistake of buying this & later not realizing that the track listing was completely screwed up. A mild-to-meager collection of fast-thrash era D.R.I. tunes, but the poor, callous production efforts are appalling.Still, if you made the same mistake of purchasing this, well, here is the correct track listing for this ""Greatest Hits"" release as well as the ""Dirty Rotten Hitz"" release:1. Who Am I2. Commuter Man3. Yes Ma'am4. The Explorer5. Violent Pacification6. I Don't Need Society7. Couch Slouch8. Mad Man9. Argument Then War10. Nursing Home Blues11. A Coffin12. Redline13. Probation14. No Religion15. Five Year Plan16. Hooked17. Sad To BeI hope this mitigates things."
4,Best thing so far,My nails have been horrible - splitting down to the edge of my fingers. This product is wonderful!! You have to be faithful however - noticed when it chipped off my nails started to break. Still - it is the best nail product I have used - my nails are starting to grow!!
3,Nail Hardener,"I have not had enough time to decide about this product. It seems fine but it has to be applied every day or so. The 24 hours nail hardener name is kind of mis-leading. I have been using it for about a week, applying it every day or so and have not noticed a significant difference."
4,great product,really helps my nails from breaking and spliting.best product I have found for my weak and thin nailsjust once a week seems to do the trick
1,don't waste your money,This did nothing but peel off my nails. I needed something to help my nails what a disappointment. Total garbage
2,Uneven,"I walk every day for pleasure and had high hopes for this book. However, it just kind of meandered from place to place. Some of the places were interesting but most did not hold my interest. Two weeks after finishing the book I could barely remember what I'd read. I also question what she chose to include and leave out of the book. For instance she discusses a Catholic pilgrimage in Mexico that she attended, but leaves out the fact that Jesus (the founder of Christianity) was in Jerusalem when he was crucified because the Bible had commanded the Jews to go (by foot) up to Jerusalem on three yearly holidays. This has to be one of the first mentions of a pilgrimage."
3,A Misnomer,"""Wanderlust"" is a German word meaning ""joy of walking"". Nowhere in the book could the joy of walking be found. Solnit creates a thin trail that connects walking with philosophy, politics, revolution, sexism, prostitution, and literature. Her disjointed rambles sidestep the topic with dull, uninteresting anecdotes that dissuaded this reader from turning the pages.But there are pleasant intervals. The most interesting parts of the book are when Solnit writes of her walking experiences. Her first person narratives draw the reader into a lively cadence when she describes her inner-city walks in San Francisco, her pilgrimage to Chimayo and her people-watching jaunt along the Las Vegas Strip.Solnit is a gifted writer who is extremely fluent. It's unfortunate that she ambled about unrelated activities and chose the experiences and words of others when she could write much more interestingly about her own walks. As an avid walker, I was disappointed with her book."
5,wonderful perspective,"This is a new way to look at cultural history and the way we live our lives that is especially relevant to our present day car culture. Wordsworth is estimated to have walked 170,000 miles in his life and sparked a cottage industry of walking tours in England and Europe. Solnit makes me realize that new cultural turns and socially revolutionary ways of living and thinking seem to coincide with new approaches to walking the land."
2,sizing is way off,The swearpants I bought were extremely large. They were at leasr two sizes bigger than ordered. They would not stay up and were baggy.
2,Not sure of quality,After one week seam on leg started to come apart. Amazon sending replacement next day and prepaid return. We will see how these hold up.
2,"nice pants, teeny little drawstring","obviously to save a buck here and there, reminds me of the $125 converse shoes i bought that came with laces so short you couldnt even double knot themwont be buying from russell(or converse)again hope they save plenty of nickels and dimes wont be seeing anymore from me"
1,"Good product, terrible service","The product, as always, is top quality. The service is terrible -- rude on the phone & give wrong information with regard to returns & the product itself. I was told that the only difference between 3X & 4X is a 2"" difference in length, no difference in waist size. Huh! Shipping is high & customer pays for return shipping. I will never order from this vendor again. A waste of time & money."
1,cheap junk,"- I am 6'2"" 195#- This product is NOT a tall size. They are at least 2-3 inches too short before washing. I typically take a 34"" inseam. I would fully expect these to be at least this long before washing. They are no where close.- I sold Men's Big and Tall clothing for 5 years professionally; we would not have let this in the store.- The elastic and the fabric are cheap and shoddily constructed and no where near warm enough; a cheap knock off of any previous issues I have owned.- I own a predecessor product from about 10 years ago: it is 3 times a thick and STILL fully long enough at about 33-34"" inseam; elastic gathers are still perfect; waist tie is broken so I wear it with a belt, and guess I still will- The current product is the cheapest foreign junk have run into in quite a while and not worthy of the Russell Athletic label I have comd to rely upon over the years- All I can say is I hope these are seconds, but I suspect not"
3,These are nice but run short,"My husband likes these to sleep in, but the tall is too short for exercising. We will look for another brand."
5,Great Fit and Comfortable~!,"Short version:Love them, great price, bought four pair, would buy them again, great service from Amazon (as always)Long version:Colors are accurate, and the red is really like Santa C. red :)I bought the 5XL and have a 31"" inseam - am 6'0"" tall - after washing in 'warm' and in the dryer for 50 minutes they fit me perfectly - so, they do shrink in the length (my fault by how I wash - but was planning for this) unless you take steps to keep that from happening - a 34"" inseam is too long for me, so I did the above on purpose.The cuff at the bottom is *not* tight (which is good for me).I would both recommend these to others, and will buy them again."
1,Poor Quality and Bad Customer Support,"I recently bought a pair of pants, #104027, to replace a pair that was stained. The new pair after only a few months have shrunk, each leg is now 6 to 8 inches shorter than my older pair. Also the fabric was changed to a lighter weight material. I sent an e-mail to Russel Athletic and they said I could send them back to Russel at my expense to be tested, not for a refund, to be tested. So I had to gamble they would replace them but most likely would only just give me depreciated credit, if that. I decided not to and buy a lotto ticket instead. Both the product and customer support for Russel Athletic is bad to poor. I'll not buy their products again. Funny the older pair of Russel pants were fine, made in China, but the newer pair, made in Pakistan, was defective. Maybe they should be making these items in the good old USA!! But greed over people is the corporate way."
1,poor sewing,I recieved these and as is my policy I washed them before wearing. After they wer dry I put them on and found the left inseam had opened about 3 to 4 inches. Only good part was that Amazon took them back and returned my money promptly.
5,heavy duty,"I haven't purchased fleece pants in almost 10 years. I'm in cold climate so I wanted cozy lounging pants. These were the ticket. I have to say they run true to size, if not almost a hair to big. Great purchase. Heavy duty, great quality and after 1 was they're perfect."
2,Cheap!!!!,"Very cheap, but for the price it is expected. I broke it after two weeks of using it. It also has the screen on the out side which I didnt like, and the phone can also slide open some if you bumped it."
4,A favorite in our house,Both my 3 and 6 year old have loved this show for 2 years now. Nick Jr. has slowly cut down it's play times...to now none at all. So I purchased several DVD's so we can keep up with the show requests!
5,Bas Rutten IS the MAN!!,"I've just got my copy of these books - and, I can say, without a doubt in my mind - That these books are totally usefull in everyday training and, in preparation for lessons in mma! They are Extremely complete - the variations and honesty of the techniques - simply amazes, even a pro fighter like myself!!If i were to get only 2 books on MMA, these would be the ones to recommend - beyond any shadow of a doubt!!Bas knows what he teaches - as he's tried it all!! And these books stay by my side during training, as an ever usefull guide to MMA!!indeed - a Must-BUY!!Very Sincerly, Lars ""Bad Boy"" Besand - of Skagen Fight Gym .dk"
2,leaky after one year,"It's a cheap kit with the filter but this faucet is crap.One year and it won't seal, just drips, (filtered water).The whole thing is plastic and cheesy feeling. I replaced it promptlywith a higher quality faucet. But like I said I bought it with a wholefilter kit here on Amazon cheap, just plan on replacing it in a year.But buying this thing by it's self? no way..."
2,fun at first but...,"When I got this game it was fun. But, after you finish the first level of game scenes it can get pretty boring. I found myself fast fowarding frequently. It's not very replayable. Maybe if they would come out with some additional game levels then you could expand but right now once you've got it you've got it."
3,I guess it's not TOO bad...,"Well, my 15 year old son was the recipient of this item. He played it alot when he first got it, but his interest in it waned in a short time."
3,OK...but monotonous,"If you like Monopoly and SimCity, then this is their love child. Monopoly Tycoon combines some of the features of both to create a new game. Monopoly's property names, utilites, rent payments, and even Chance Cards make it in to the game, while SimCity's building and city planning also are factors.All in all a good game, but after a while, you are just doing the same things over and over again to win. Can get boring, but still a good game."
1,MT has problems on W95 platform,"I bought the game the day it was released. I currently have W95 OS installed on my PC. For some reason dealing with how MT handles is copy protection file, the game will not allow me to start to play beyond the initial splash page. I have been in contact with Infogrames support over the past two weeks and they have just now realized the problem due to ""a flood"" of e-mails and phone calls regarding the same problem. They are working on a patch but I will have to give this game 1 star since it was not properly tested on W95 machines. What else did they not do in order to release on time?"
3,"If money and power is your thing, this is a game for you.","I think this game is great to teach a lesson in business and wealth creation. A lot of the principles apply in real life. However, there is a formula for success, which makes the game boring after you figured it out. There is a good selection of challenges that you can play. I do wish there is an option where I can design my own challenge. Computer players are not too competitive, even at the ""advance"" level. Great graphic, good tutorial. Overall, great game if you are into money and business."
3,Worth a Discount Price,"The concept of the game is an interesting spin on the board game-- place businesses in blocks to garner a profit, lease the lots to monopolize a block. The game stays true to the original board game in its buy-out concept, building hotels, become the basic ""tycoon"". The game does get a little monotonous after a while, what with repeating the same process of building stores and attempting to outdo your opponents with the same maneuvers. The graphics are somewhat grainy as well. But the music is pleasant, and, as long as you don't obsessively labor over it for a week and then drop it, it is a fun game."
4,Pretty good - could be better....,"This is a very visually stimulating game; however, once you figure out how to win one scenerio - it's not too much of a challenge to win the other scenerios. That doesn't mean that the game is boring - it provided me with hours upon hours of play time. There are so many things to build and buy. It also provides younger people with a simplistic but good foundation for how the business world operates. If you could set up a multi-player game against ""real"" people - you could really test your skills. The other downside is that once you win the scenerio - that's it game over. I would prefer to continue play on some of the scenerios - maybe if they have another version - they could incorporate this. But overall - a very good game."
2,Not for serious simulation game players,"If you're into such ""real"" simulation games such as Railroad Tycoon, Civilization, or the Sim-series, this game is not for you. It is very simplist, and not at all challenging. The graphics aren't that great, and there aren't that many factors influencing game play that make it interesting."
1,What a waste,"This game was a complete waste of money, the graphics were terrible and the gameplay was flat out boring, it should really cost only 5 bucks. The first day I had it I thought it was pretty cool, building cloth, food and toy stores but the game took forever to load and got jammed alot. The only reason I bought it was because I thought it was going to be like Roller Coaster Tycoon and the Sims. Dont get this game unless you try it first, my suggestion is to get RollerCoaster Tycoon, the Sims or Sim City 3000 instead."
2,For Online - many technical problems,"The game if played solo is just an average nothing special gameand can in fact be aggravating.If wishing online play, (which would be more interesting and is advertised), people should first review all the comments about technical problems. Those can be viewed at the Gamespy.com forum."
3,new review cancelling last one,"I finished all levels in this game. Know I am done, they could have added so much more and made it more challenging. My grandkids are more likely to like it. I wasted my money on this game. So far the top game is roller coaster I am still playing that after l year."
2,so dull so boring....,"Let me explain this game.... however bizzare it may be.Basicly you are some business tycoon building shops, renting different businesses, and getting rich. Perhaps some 60 yr old retired business man may enjoy this, but definately not the general public.However, it still has a good side.... starting shops, apartments, ect.. but that becomes boring and repetitive after about 1-2 hours. Definately not worth more than $5"
3,Good game if you are on a budget,"Overall the game is decent. It's one of those games that you can pop in the machine and play for a half hour on any given day. For that reason it makes a good game when you need a break from the truly addictive games, it also gives the game a long shelf-life. The grpahics and sounds are fair at best. As other reviews have mentioned, every scenario is the same city; however, they do change what has already been built at the beginning of the scenario. For example, if you have previously succeeded by owning Park Place and Boardwalk and building them up, the next scenario might have Park Place and Boardwalk already built up by the city. This forces you to change your overall strategy. On the later and longer scenarios there are more and more buildings being constructed but the population remains pretty stagnet. Your computer components don't ever change the way they think which you may or may not like. If the price is right, go ahead and buy."
2,Riches to Rags,"This game can quickly catch you, and it appears fun in the beginning. But after a while, once you have beaten the simple scenario mode and you have played multiplayer a few times, the game starts to become really repetitive and boring. The concept is always the same throught the entire game, and nothing seems to change. I wouldn't suggest getting it...after 2 weeks of playing it, you will probably get bored of it and put it down."
2,Fun for about 5 minutes,"The game is basically just no fun. You do these scenarios and then the computer gives you more scenarios to choose from. (similiar to RollerCoaster Tycoon, but that game was great) I bought it because I liked Monopoly and SimCity, however the game was not like either one. The buildings all look similiar, so it is not exactly eye catching. Plus, there is no way to play a game against the computer, unless you playing a scenario. There is no way to play the game that can be played over the internet, with the computer. The only reason I gave this game two stars is because of the internet play, which really isn't too bad. Any way, try to play the game first before paying... for one."
2,Not ready for prime time,"As an avid RCT fan, I was really looking forward to MT release.Well, it arrived yeasterday and I must say, it is terrible. The graphics (esp. the text)look like something designed 10 years ago. The concept execution is very complicated, mixing city building SIM,business SIM and ""character"" SIM, but is a way too confusing way. The game froze a few times, and I couldn't exit it. The early scenarios are simplistic. It's not even up to the quality of a beta version! What else bad can I say?I only refrain from giving it 0 stars (even though I gave up ""playing"" after 45 minutes)I am hoping MT has ""potential"" if I can steel myself to get back to it. BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD FOLKS."
1,Bad Technical support!,"What kind of technical support,?? Are u persuding me not to buy any product from your company anymore, and also for ppl who I know?? There is no support for asia pacific area. I bought this game at here and they send an attached file which do not have any contact for asia pacific division! Then this is uselessHere is the message I recieved this morning.This facility provides technical support to customers residing in NorthAmerica, only.Support for Infogrames products in your area will be listed in the back ofyour game manual. Please consult this manual for the proper support contactinformation.Attached is a list of all of Infogrames technical support contacts, one ofwhich should be able to help you.ColeInfogrames Technical Support"
3,This is a confusing game -- very challenging,"Bought this game for my teenage daughters last Christmas ('02) and none of us have played it very often. Not at all like the board game, it's a bit confusing and hard to play. I suppose we need to take the time to read all of the directions -- I've tried but they haven't helped much. Consider Roller Coaster Tycoon instead."
2,It wasn't what I expected.,"I had just recieved the game on Friday and I was not inpressed at all. The whole game is not at all like the board game. It's too complicated to play with and there should be a little bit more player construction in the game. Monopoly Tycoon is nothing like the Roller Coaster Tycoon game, with that we were able to design all of our attractions with that game. This game is not at all a Tycoon game. Sorry, but this game just doesn't cut for me...."
5,Most Intense Taebo Ever...,"I've done Taebo on and off for many years, but recently got back into it a couple months after my daughter was born (18 month ago). I started off slow, but for the last year I've been doing his more advanced workouts. I'd say I workout to Taebo about three to four times a week. Needless to say, it doesn't matter how much Taebo I do, this video challenges me every time. There are days where it takes every last ounce of me to get through it. There is no letting up in this video so take a lot of deep breaths before you start because there will be no time for that until after the workout is over. I do this on days when I want to burn a lot (and I stress a lot) of calories. It's a great intense workout!!"
4,IF YOU WANT TO BURN THE CALORIES FAST...,"GET THIS DVD...You will burn at least 1000 calories once you master the moves and can HANG until the end!!! If you do this DVD at least 4 times a week YOU WILL SEE IMPROVEMENT within 30 days, hands down. I give it 4 stars because of the off beat counting at times, but with Blanks new DVD Tae-Bo Cardio, much of this has been addressed and cleared up. You will workout and feel it, but at the end it is worth it. Also, KNOW THE TECHNIQUE before purchasing this DVD. If you do not, I advise to get the original Tae-Bo or Tae-Bo Live DVD's. These DVD's have the instructional section which will walk you through the technique. Many have complained of knee injury etc., remember when you kick you raise your thigh and extend your leg, do not just throw it out there, this is where injuries occur. And again, it is important to know the technique before jumping into any of the workouts, including the basic format."
5,Great Workout,I used to teach aerobics but this workout has me in much better shape than I was then.I don't get winded walking upstairs anymore and it really is the best workout for your whole body that I have found. It isn't easy but you have to do what you can and stick with it.
1,Marketing Appeal,"Come on! Do you really think you'll end up looking ""ripped""? The Tae Bo workouts have a slick marketing campaign to make the consumer think they will get hard bodies after doing these videos. Truth is, these videos are all hype and do not explain the moves safely, especially for those of you who may be beginners. Really, if these videos are as good as they say they are, wouldn't more of us looked ""ripped""? Where are all the ""ripped"" people anyway? Making appointments with plastic surgeons........."
3,"don't buy the advance workout, if you own the basic workout!","I purchased the basic workout dvd a amonth ago and loved it. I felt I was ready for the advanced workout and wanted to see if I could keep up. I did but, I found it not as much fun as the basic workouts. The music was not as engaging and there was too much talking on the second advanced workout. The routines seem thrown together. The basic workouts are the way to go and with the dvd you get the 8 minute workout, which is very intense. You can skip over the cool down from the first and second and then finish off with the 8 minute, which includes a cool down. You will feel great, energized and pumped up! I have lost 7lbs. already!"
5,TaeBo II: Get Ripped Advanced Workout review,"This is the best taped workout I have ever done. This is the second time I've bought this particular DVD. I am in good shape. I mountain bike in the summer and ski in the winter and I still find this DVD a challenge. Besides strengthening muscles, it improves balance and gives an excellent cardio workout."
5,Good Addition to the Billy Library!,"I have been doing the boot camp series for about 9 months and bought the Get Ripped workout to add into the mix. It has helped me tremendously. Some days the Boot Camp gets to intense and Get Ripped is a nice alternative. Also, it helps you work on balance and technique that is so important to the Tae Bo experience. Wonderful product!"
4,Great aerobic video to make you sweat,"I would recommend this video if you want to sweat. I'm 34 and in pretty good shape (with the exception of the the small layer of fat around my waist)and this video makes me sweat. It's a great all around workout, combining cardio exercises to get your heart pumping and strength training to build muscle. One nice thing is that in the video he has real people with all different types of bodies. Not everybody in the video has a body like a model so it doesn't make you feel that out of shape and ashamed of your body. Definitely recommend."
1,Rampart...don't bother,"This is the worst movie I have seen in years...it is, sort of, a takeoff of the TV show ""Southland"" which I think is an excellent series.Even paying the $2.99 with my Prime membership was a waste of money.I did watch the preview first and thought it was questionable...so I thought the movie would be better...not so.So, in my opinion...don't waste your time on this one..."
2,Slow burn character study of a bad cop.,"This movie just didn't click for me the whole thing was a little off as the camera work, I like Woody and all but this one is slow and lackluster and did I say slow? If not for Woody in the lead it would be 2 stars. If you must? Rent it. I will always tell it like I see it..... Good or bad.Scott M"
2,A+ performance in a C+ movie.,"Ever had one of those moments where you wonder 'what might have been'? Well, watch this movie and you WILL have one of those moments. Despite Woody's incredible performance and a stellar cast this flick only gives you occasional smart spurts of greatness. And an ending so bad it makes the one in No Country For Old Men seem like The Usual Suspects. It's like watching The Last King Of Scotland - expect a great acting performance, but not a great movie."
1,"One star, because there aren't zero starts",Most god awful movie I've seen in a long time. Painfully bad. Wish I could get my money and time back.
1,Dreadful waste of talent,Dark scrambled tale of whacked out LA cop running wild in completely unbelievable story with no redeeming features. This is one of the worst movies available to rent on Amazon. Steer clear unless you are a fan of incoherent filmes.
3,Had potential but missing something,"Something was missing in this movie. The plot never really played out. It was on the cusp of being a really good, probably due to Woody Harrelson's acting, but the story had no follow thru and your left disappointed."
3,Harrelson gets better all the time,I watched this with trepidation feeling it would be extremely violent and without mercy for a viewer whotends toward characters rather than action and shoot 'em ups. It delivered a brilliant performance byWoody Harrelson in the midst of brief encounters with other terrific actors.Bravo Woody. I had never heard of Rampart before this movie but this filled in some LAPD history.
2,Huge dissapointment,"I was very excited to watch this movie, as one who has followed the history of the LAPD and the Rampart scandal specifically. This was aimless, unbelievable, and really not about LAPD or Rampart (superficially, yes), but about an unlikable character in a totally implausible story. Far better would be watch the series ""The Shield"" (amazing) or the Frontline PBS documentary ""LAPD Blues,"" all about the Rampart scandal. Harelson is a great actor, but he can't save this really lackluster film. Just left me feeling....ugh/ick/yuck. Don't bother."
2,Not what the previews looked like,Not sure what ever one sees in this movie. I like Woody Harrelson he is a good actor but it wasn't to hard not to do a good job acting in the 1st half of this movie when every other scene is the main actor going to bed with a different women. This was not what the previews made it out to be. I thought it would be across between Southland and Training Day and it wasnt even close other then the 2 or 3 scenes there wasn't much action.
2,What kind of ending was that?,"it started out with Woody Harrilson great performance, however it ended with nothing. The end had no end of the story. It totally sucked. Left you with no anticipation or conclusion."
3,"Good movie, but abrupt ending","I enjoyed this movie and the acting was great. Always enjoy seeing Anne Heche and Cynthia Nixon. Two of the finest actresses out there. Woody Harrelson was perfect for this role. The movie was a great character study. However, all of a sudden it just ended. It was as if they ran out of video. I would have liked to have seen an ending that made sense."
1,Love Woody....Hate the movie,this movie was a wast of time.it is not worth the energy to run the tv.it has a good cast and that is it.
3,"Great Acting, Ambiguous Ending","After seeing Woody Harrelson on Charlie Rose, I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. The acting was very good, and the plot was very interesting as far as it went, but as a previous reviewer noted, the ending was quite a disappointment. It felt like 20-30 minutes of the movie were missing. The was no resolution, which seems to be a trend with so many recent movies. I wanted more about what motivated Harrelson's character, and to know the outcome of his situation."
2,extra star for Woody,"ladies and gentleman,this movie is a bomb.i only stuck with it because of Woody.i kept hoping it would get better as it went along and it just dragged.i was waiting for the main character to eat a bullet of go out in a hail of gunfire,but the ending sucked.waste of my valuable movie watching time."
4,"Woody, Woody Woody!","Woody Harrelson's performance is top notch. He is gritty, raw and brings a man's downward spiral to the screen like no other. Woody, Ben Foster and Director Oren Moverman have formed a unique connection evident on screen. The rest of the cast Ice Cube, Robin Wright, Steve Buscemi, Sigourney Weaver, Anne Heche, Cynthia Nixon, etc really give an amzing performance."
1,do not watch,"The movie starts off good and then it gets boring, boring and more boring. All the while I'm thinking about all the loose ends (there are too many to count) and they'll ties them all together but they don't. Then it just ends, leaving you wondering what did I just watch???? There is no PLOT!!!!!!!"
1,Rampart,I would like to send a bill to the producer and the director for my time. The whole thing was horrible. I hate wasting a Friday night.
1,Worst Movie Ever,"This movie is probably one of the worst I have ever seen. I don't know who all the people above are, probably people trying to promote the movie because they benefit from it monetarily...that could be the only explanation for saying anything good about it. I'm mad i spent 1.20 renting it. And I had to give a star to write a review. So actually, that is a minus one star."
1,pointless,"This is a movie written, directed and produced by people who don't know, or have any interest in how to tell a story. There's no plot whatsoever, no discernible meaning and no resolution at all. Completely unrewarding artsy crap, battling it out with ""Stone"" and ""Lost in Translation"" for most pointless cinema experience of my life."
1,"Big POS, do not buy this movie","Screwed again, and this is why I'm writing this review to save others from making the same mistake. First off, $14.99 for a copy that's NOT EVEN HD, THIS IS NOT HD - are you serious, really, really. Then it ends with him driving away, just ends, this movie basically has no ending. Do these people think that's cool, is that cool to end a movie with no ending? - NO IT'S NOT, NO IT'S NOT, NO IT'S NOT, NO IT'S NOT ...!!!!!!!!! BEN FOSTER SHOULD STICK TO ACTING AND DROP THE DIRECTING HAT INTO THE NEARBY DUMPSTER. About the only thing this movie does is educate people about why they don't ever want to go anywhere near Los Angeles, what a F'ing dump...!!! This is one of the biggest POS movies I've seen in awhile, shame on Woody Harrelson, Ben Foster, and Sig Weaver. It's obviously a quick cash grab for all concerned. If I didn't have to give it a star - it wouldn't have gotten one."
2,Not What It Looked Like,"The trailer/preview is the best part of the movie. Harrelson is great, but there is no ""tense"" ""action"" really in the film. A couple of gritty moments, but that's it and a lot of unresolved plot lines that go nowhere. It doesn't even have the decency to spiral all the way downward and end in some kind of self-implosion or something. Anything."
1,horrible ending,"Dave Brown is a bad cop and is being pursued by the District Attorney (played by Sigorney Weaver)and an internal affairs cop. With two hours of interaction you expect that Dave will be arrested, or escape but neither ending is provided. As another review noted, it's like the last 20 minutes of the movie was deleted. That was very disappointing and makes you feel like you have wasted your time."
1,boring,"it was slow,it was boring there was no action.was hoping for more police drama.do not waste your time or money."
2,Rampart,The quality of the video & download was great. The movie itself was not what I thought it was. Did not like it!
3,"Brilliant acting, pointlessly depressing story","Woody Harrelson is a phenomenal actor. But this story seems to go nowhere. Maybe that was the point, but at the end of the movie, I felt like I had wasted my time."
2,Not at All Good for Me,"I've liked a lot of Woody's movies, but not this one. It's the worst one I've ever seen him in. (That's the required twenty words, isn't it?)"
1,terrible,This movie was terrible. . . I can't believe I spent $ on it. Definitely Buy at your own risk. . .
1,Do not waste your hard earned money!!!!,This movie was terrible! What a tremendous waste of money! No wonder it went straight to blue-ray. I expected more from Woody.
1,Disappointing,I allowed myself to be sucked in by the preview and was disappointed. I found myself waiting and waiting for the climax of this film and it didn't happen. In fact it seemed to drag on and not make sense. I don't really have the words to explain how terrible this movie was and how good it could have been. So I will just stop here and say don't waste your money or time.
1,worst ending ever,"Movie was a little awkward in its production. Woody was ok, and it was never understood why his character did not eat. Camera angles were too edgy and did not make the film any better. Hey director you are not Scorsese, so don't try to do a taxi movie for the 21st century. Overall the movie story line left many loose ends. It was the icing on the cake for disappointment."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"First off, I think Woody Harrelson is one of the best actors out there. Where do I start with this movie? It is boring, lacks plot and is very hard to watch. The story is so terrible that is really does not matter how many great actors they stuff in it, the entire movie is a pile of you know what!Please don't waste your money or time like I did and wait for it to show up free on TV somewhere if it ever does. If not, you will not miss a thing!"
2,Slow and unspectacular,"based in 1999, this one tells the story of an LAPD officer, working at the Rampart division, who is crossing the line and venturing to the other side of the law. This recalls the LAPD Rampart scandal of the era, when officers were framing suspects, and planting drugs and weapons on them. The movie goes between the story of the officer's problems on the job, and the relationship difficulties with his daughters and two exes. The problem I had with the movie was that it focused a little too much on the family situation and not enough on the policing scandal. The film would have been more compelling had it been more focused on the officer being involved in overstepping his authority and getting involved in possible criminal activity. A bit slow and unspectacular, this one was a disappointment."
3,Woody at his best and worst,Rampart is a Woody Harrelson product. Viewers will enjoy everything but the ending. There could have been a little more editing as the movie seemed to loose momentum periodically. The director and/or Woody Harrelson seemed impressed with the acting abilities of the actor playing the youngest daughter. There was at least one scene that the camera zoomed in on her face. She has a Demi-esque appearance. The movie is packed with accomplished actors.
1,Horrible,I am usually a big fan of Woody Harelson. But this movie was a complete waste of time and money. Dont make my mistake of renting this movie.
1,Made in China,"It is stainless steel, expensive and non practical pocket knife, not for shaving; it is made in China, get a REAL German blade. I got a Dovo and I am super happy!"
2,just a fancy pocket knife,Razor is not sharp enough to shave and probably never will be. I brought the razor to get sharpened and they said it will need a whole new edge. The guy told me its not even worth getting it done. I bought a shave ready Dovo instead and I recommend you do the same.
4,"Not bad, looks nice.","Great blade, but takes a lot to get it to shave ready. Scales are glued on, I removed them then bonded with epoxy to make permanent."
3,satisfied,product got here on time and in good condition. was what i ordered and was a fine product.
4,Raw & Penetrating!,"( this review is for the American release )This album borders between comical lucidity and delusionary discourse. E's writing has a style of its own, with a cynical wisdom that can penetrate your soul. Soul Jacker digs into the shadows and brings to light a series of songs that are sexy and provocative.Some highlights: Woman Driving Man Sleeping (Excellent!), Friendly Ghost (Fav), Bus Stop BoxerSome songs like That's Not Really Funny, World of S#it, and Jungle Telegraph are lush with experimentalism -- concoctions of overlapping sounds and quirky instrumentation that reveal a certain creative genius, something we've come to expect from the songwriter called E.A few of the songs veer into tedium (Teenage Witch, Soul Jacker partII ), but not at the expense of an innovation that sets E's work apart from the masses.A worthy addition to the Eels discography and must buy for his fans."
2,Mr. E's (Formerly) Beautful Blues,"This is what happens when a brilliant band... gets bored. Wanting a change, Eels changes their tune. And in turn, bores their audience.Rather than build upon their past intricate-pop success, Eels decide to amp up and rock out. Unfortunetly, Eels doesn't realize they are no good at rocking out. Here, they bring aboard some guy named Kool G. Murder and the result is limp and lazy. In fact, one of the few decent songs on the album (Fresh Feeling) actually samples from a song their OWN last album. How pathetic is that?Kudos to a band for trying out a new sound. But on Souljacker, they entered a musical arena where they simply don't belong. Neither satisfying to fans of heavier rock or fans of Eels. Souljacker is stale and starved."
4,OTHERS SAY IT MORE SUCCINCTLY,"Kevin Doyle and John T. Molloy have written books on this subject and both of those authors seem to share the opinion that the universal qualities men look for in a mate are accomplishment and morality, notwithstanding all female efforts to be sexually alluring or socially superior."
4,Positive and funny at times!,This book is not only published by the best publisher that is the best academic publisher out their. But unlike most self help books it focuses more on the you can do it attitude rather then you screwed up now lets fix it or someone else did (like your ex) and you need to realize it.This Is a best selling author for a reason folks! And although some of the info in this book isn't brain surgery to already know for those who need reminding/verification in a humorous way this certainly is! This author rocks even if her knowledge isn't all accurate occasionally or hard to already obtain without this book.
5,Good Weight,This sweatshirt is a great weight. Not too heavy and not too light. It's great for cool fall mornings or evenings.
1,Too Small For Stated Size,"Too Small For Stated Size:The Russell 3X Pro Cotten Hooded Sweat Shirt fits like a 1X!I've purchased many Russell 3X items { T's, Premier Sweats etc.}that fit fine...these pro-cotten hooded sweats do not!"
2,sewing flaws,"The seams where the front and back cloth panels meet the waist band are unraveling, both left and right sides. Only had it for a week. Luckily I am a sewing wizard.Its made in Pakistan! -- Solution:1) beat the little girl who sewed it more than usual, obviously she is falling asleep after only 14 hours on the job!2) make sure her burqa fits is not sliding over her eyes.:P"
3,WHAT PLANET ARE THESE PEOPLE ON????,"I decided to read this book reading all the 5star reviews on this site, well i have gone through the book cover to cover, there really isn't much that's interesting here, besides maybe how his girlfriend snatched the paintings from him, you'd probably be better off reading CRIME AND PUNISHMENT OR THE ALIENIST."
5,unlike any other book i have ever read.,"""it happened in boston?"" is one of the coolest strangest pieces of fiction (?) i have ever read. it has been many years since i have read it, however i have never forgotten it and look for it often, whenever i am in used bookstores. i lent it to a friend, only to never see it again. i should have known better... a CLASSIC!"
4,Love this series of books,I have enjoyed all of the books up til now and this one is no different and am looking forward to the next.!If you like fantasy books then you will love the adventure Drizzit has with his companions.
5,Great book,"Another great book in the dark elf searies. If you enjoyed the first the streams of silver is going to blow you away, it action pacted and full of mistery and even some comedy here and there."
5,Page-turning quest action!,"... Salvatore has managed to create dynamic characters that I fell completely in love with almost immediately upon meeting them (and even those who I did not fall immediately in love with, I immediately hated. A strong feeling, either way). With the exception of one (Wulfgar the barbarian calls to mind others of his type, such as Conan), they are fairly unique, and each of them only gets more well developed as the story goes on. This is especially true in the case of the dark elf Drizzt, who turns out to be what most would consider the main character. From the start, you are witness to internal reflection on a level that most novels do not allow, but in a way that does not diminish the action of the story. ...For full review, please visit me at Here Be Bookwyrms on Blogger!herebebookwyrms dot blogspot dot com"
5,Wow.,Wow. This is the best fantasy since Lord of the Rings and way easier written. Though Tolkiens world is undeniably the best ever written it is much harder to read. Streams of silver by R.A. Salvatore takes you in depth in a world written in layers of imagination. Drizzt's unending strugle of who he is go's to the extreme whence he meats a shadow of who he might have been. This book is a must have for fantasy readers.
3,nice introduction to a few indicators,"This book covers a few of the more popular indicators in some detail, and as such I think it's a helpful book. Some of the more encyclopedic volumes, like Marty Pring's, can be overwhelming. This is not a bad place to start learning about technical analysis, or to review some basics."
2,Badly Needs Updating,"As and introduction to technical analysis techniques and their application, this book is satisfactory. Unfortunately, it was written pre-internet and pre-laser printer (mid/late 80's). The example charts are a bit ragged - they look like they were printed on an old dot matrix printer - and they aren't especially clear. And much of the book is dedicated to step-by-step proceedures for doing the calculations - not terribly useful information when all this analysis is now available for free via the internet.Given the price, I would recommend more recent books by Martin Pring or the updated classic by John Murphy. The practice of technical analysis has changed dramatically since Eng authored his book."
5,Amazing read,"I am totally amazed by this book. I am trying to find out something about the author Erskine Lane. And the research is very difficult. The descriptions of Guatemala are really breath-taking and then his philosophic/spiritual insights are deep and worthy any of the well-known spiritual guides of our times. And then all of that moves seamlessly into sensual, honest descriptions of sexual experience. I find his writing fascinating. If anyone out there has information on the author I would greatly appreciate hearing about it. josephmcclain2@hotmail.com"
3,"could be more easier to read ,wish it didn't double talk",book could be sampler to read i feel at times i have to outline and number things in a pargraph to make were i can start to understand.
5,Read It And Laugh,"If you've ever spent hours in a chat room, or if your sweetie spends hours in chat rooms and you've been wondering what the hell that's all about, read this book. This is also a good book for anyone who ever wonders what love is. Or whether infidelity ""counts"" if it's cybersex. You'll also like this book if you take sex too seriously, or if you can't take sex seriously at all. (Actually there's a little too much hot sex in this book for my tastes, but what kind of criticism is that?) The important thing is that Lisa33 is laugh-out-loud funny. This is a damn funny one-of-a-kind book and you ought to read it right away."
1,Sigh.,"This book is utter crap. While I don't doubt that there is a portion of the Internet that is like the world described in this book, books like this simply reinforce stereotypes out there that this is ALL that chat rooms and Internet relationships are about. I can't believe that someone read this and thought it was worth publishing. Sad. I'm even more angry that I wasted my money on it."
1,Reality Ad Nauseum,"This book could have been cobbled together from chatroom logs and emails that are duplicated thousands of times over every day. This may be a work of fiction, but take it from someone who has run a chatroom for years, this is just more of the same. If you want to know what starts out in a chatroom and then continues behind the scenes in IM and email, by all means read it.Funny? Depends on your definition of the word. If families breaking up and people pretending to be things they are not are funny, sure. I found it depressing, probably because it's so real."
3,Gillette Fusion Average NormaGel Standard Shave-OK Gel Gel,"Note to self: fancy names do not a fancy product make.HydraGel? There must be water in it.Moisturizing? The water must somehow make it into my skin.Shave? Ah, so THAT'S what it's for.Gel? Two ""Gel""s? It must be really gel-ish.Aloe? It has aloe? What DOESN'T have aloe in it these days?Cocoa Butter? No, this product is not edible.I have no intention of giving Gillette ""Fusion"" a bad name (exactly what is being fused here?), but this product is unremarkable in every way, shape, and form. It is blue, foams up just fine, smears about the skin without clumping, and stays put while you shave. My skin felt no more or less moist and buttery after using this product than it did after using any other. It's not a bad gel (and, surprisingly, the ten dollar name comes with a five dollar price tag), but it's also not an exceptional one.Buy it if you like orange containers. Or if you've got other Gillette Fusion products and you enjoy consistency."
2,Too many mistakes.,"I agree with the other reviewers who have said that this book is sloppy. There are just far too many mistakes for a 2nd edition book; very discouraging in an Addison-Wesley print.The content is OK, and fairly thorough, but as another reviewer noted, there's considerable handwaving going on in some of the explanations.Bottom line: a cleaned-up 3rd edition could be a very good textbook. Too bad I'm stuck with the 2nd edition :("
4,Solid material but not clean enough,"I like this book very much. I have used it for a course I am about to finish.It provides a solid foundation for anyone interested in parallel computing on distributed memory architectures. Although there is some material on shared memory machines, this material is fairly limited which might be something the authors should change for a 3rd edition given the times we're living in.The complaint I would raise is that the book doesn't always feel ""clean"". It's hard to give a concrete example but sometimes you really have to spend some time to understand where a communication time complexity comes from even though the author's refer to a table of communication time complexities. Why? Because the table is based on that the underlying architecture is a hypercube which isn't really made explicit anywhere (?)."
4,A wonderful tribute.,"The artwork for this album is lovely.Tracks which caught my ear were those fromTrance to the Sun, Cruciform, and Cinema Strange.To me this album is fun, dark, and deep, definitelyworth a listen."
5,Blame Canada,These are classic characters from a classic movie! Buy them before the toy line for this series is discontinued!
3,Woody Halloween Costume,"This is a cute costume. My son loves it. I am not sure how well it will hold up. The hat, holster, and boots are foam. The holster is sewn to the side. The vest is also sewn on."
3,It's okay,"My son wore it for his birthday party-we had a Toy Story Costume party. It tore within the first two hours. He had fun and can still wear it but for the price, I would expect a little more durability"
4,Nice present!,"It was a present for my nephew, he loved it because it was exactly he wanted. The hat a boots also are nice"
4,Good deal,"It was a perfect custome for my 3 year old kid.The hat ws pretty fine, altough the fabric is quite ordinary. It is good just for a single use"
2,Doesn't arrive as shown and described,We ordered a multipiece costume as shown and described. What we received was a one piece costume with the vest printed on the uni-suit and no gun holster.
4,A good buy!,"This is a quality product! My son wears a 2T , and it fit him very well....so I would say it runs a bit small. However, it was easy tout on and off a toddler! He also LOVED the boot covers and they were fine to walk in. I would strongly recommend this product, not ""cheaply"" made at all!"
4,Great costume! Runs a bit small.,"I ordered a 3T-4T for my 2 year old and it fits him just right. He is in the 50th percentile which tells me this probably runs a little small, but as there were not 2T sizes available, it worked out perfectly for us. My son loves dressing up in his Woody costume with it's boots, hat, and holster."
1,horrible!,this woody costume is horrible!! very cheap looking and it look nothing like the one from disney!!i cant believe how badly made it was..it was ripped on the side of one of the legs andthe hat did not even fit!!!i would love to rate this less than one star
4,How Hitler almost came to power in 1923.,"Before reading this book, I read about the attempted coup de etat by the Nazis as a farce. In fact, it was nothing of the sort. It involved thousands of persons, and the murder of close to twenty people. The Nazis came close to seizing power and marching onto Berlin. However, three civil servants decided that they weren't going to be persuaded by the barrell of a gun. They changed their minds and toppled the coup leaders of Luddendorf and Hitler. Hitler learned from his mistakes and became even more deadly when he actually took power in 1933, ten years later.This is a good read about the attempted take over by the Nazis. As the previous reviewer has noted, it has the feel of a newspaper account of the coup. A good read."
3,Good description of metropolitan life in the Twenties.,"There were some moments that reminded me of Little House on the Prairie - how could so much tragedy happen to one person? But it was fun to see the main character traced through the roaring twenties in Charleston, New York, and parts of Europe."
5,On Leaving Charleston... timeless classic Southern Epic,"I am a nut about Southern history and Alexandra Ripley is one of the best fiction writers EVER regarding Southern history- her accurate depictions of geography, history, culture, architecture, customs is fantastic. Great read , characters fully developed and flows well. For those of you that have never visited Charleston , this will make you want to book your tickets!"
4,He Is Risen bulletin board set,This bulletin board set is very nice and larger pieces than I thought it would be. I would buy similar products again.
1,unbearable,I had to sell my copy for one dollar on Ebay - I couldn't stand to own it. The Marriage of Figaro DVD from the same production company/Glyndebourne Festival is wonderful so I hoped this production would be as well but it wasn't.
4,Great actors,"I can only agree with all the other positive reviews of this work.The singing is excellent, the set likewise and John Rawnsley is the Figaro I have always had in my mind's eye.But what I liked best about this production is that not only are the singers excellent (which is what one expects anyway) but that they are (by and large) excellent actors as well. Contrary to many operatic productions where the acting is wooden at best, here the acting is expressive (without being excessive) and suits the music and the situation. Perhaps my favorite is the Buena sera scene where Basilio is being chivied out of the room by Bartolo, Figaro, Rossina and Almaviva. The expressions of resignation and exasperation on Basilio's face are superb.My only quibble is about Maria Ewing as Rossina. Somehow I just couldn't warm up to her. She sings very well, but as a tempestous Spanish maiden who will attract the dashing Count Almaviva she just isn't convincing.If you like Rossini and Figaro, this is for you."
3,Can't compare to recent Met,"It is so hard to purchase operas! I want to enjoy the full presentation, not just the musical proficiency. This one was a mix. I could have used a lot more subtitles. Don Bartolo was an arrogant older man, but not a ridiculous character (that was interesting). On the other hand, Figaro was a bit (deliberately) ridiculous. The singing was good, but can't compare to the more recent bel canto of Juan Diego Flores and Joyce DiDonato."
2,"So, so read",Did not like the forward. Other greater Benedictine men and women could have been mentioned here who championed the cause in the United States.
3,"Cute. Not erotic, but cute.","This is comic book porn with the emphasis on ""comic book:"" yes, the images & story lines are fundamentally pornographic, but the anime-inspired drawing and all black&white; line art content skew it away from being in any way erotic. Cute & funny tho', and the drawing *is* well done if you're not sick to death of anime style as I am.I suppose if I had any drawing talent at all & could only manage to draw anime-style, well, then I'd feel different about it. And hey, the plot lines show at least a little humourous creativity, so I gave it an extra star for that! :)"
2,"Serves OK, but too small to feed my bunny for days",I put hay in this bin feeder for my 2.5 lb bunny. I can only fit one day's worth of hay in it unlike it is advertised to hold 5 days of food. The snap lock doesn't work. I have used a separate wire to secure it inside the cage.
4,Really happy about this purchase,We have two guinea pigs who always used to tip over their feed bowls every day. We would end up wasting a ton of food and felt like I was buying a 10 pound bag every week! This feeder has been great to eliminate waste and I don't feel like I am constantly refilling their food. Definitely recommend this product!
3,Not Chew Proof,"It screwed on nice and tight to the cage, Bunbury the Rabbit pulled it off. I used a nontoxic glue...and he chewed through the exact right spot to get it off and dump the whole thing all over the cage. Maybe I just need a dumber rabbit :-)To address what appears to be comments on size, it holds enough food for it to still be fresh food. I wouldn't want for it to feed my rabbit for two weeks because the food at the bottom would always be stale.This product didn't make any promises it couldn't keep, it was simply not what I was hoping for."
1,Not chew proof,My 4 chinchilla's chew off the bottom part of this in 5 days. Do not recommend this product to owner of chins that like to chew (pretty much all of chins)
3,As described! Definitely not chew proof so 3 stars.,Great concept & a neccessity! If I could buy again I would have went with steel though.The life of this Bin Feeder is dependent on your rats personality..My sisters is chewed up by her few males..& Mine?? Well lets just say one rat likes to go in it and chewed a hole through the top.Nevertheless great product - chew vulerabilities.
3,This book is from the U.K.,"This is an informative book, in terms of breaking down what everyone does on a set, and giving tips on how to prepare for a shoot. However, the writers are in England, and base their experience on making a short film in England. So, be prepared for lots of ""things are much different in the USA"" for some of their advice regarding permits, insurance, contracts, and production resources."
2,Boot Camp,"This isn't a work out, it's boot camp. If you aren't in really good shape, or like to be able to move the next day, DO NOT DO THIS. Try Windsor Pilates instead, work your way up to this. Other wise you'll be in serious pain the next day! His counting is terrible and does too many reps on one side and not enough on the other...."
1,Marketing Hype,"Come on! Do you really think you'll end up looking ""ripped""? The Tae Bo workouts have a slick marketing campaign to make the consumer think they will get hard bodies after doing these videos. Truth is, these videos are all hype and do not explain the moves safely, especially for those of you who may be beginners. Really, if these videos are as good as they say they are, wouldn't more of us looked ""ripped""? Where are all the ""ripped"" people anyway? Making appointments with plastic surgeons........."
4,2 great choices depending on your mood!,"I had been doing the original Tae Bo tapes and was bored with them. I do not have a lot of time to spend exercising, maximum of 1/2 hour a day. This DVD is great, I can choose which workout I want to do, or if I have extra time I will do both of them.This is a great buy and lots of fun!"
3,Tae-Bo Get Ripped?,"These two tapes are way too tame compared to the Basic tape in the Live series - I hardly sweated at the end of the tapes! I returned mine as I found them to be too ""beginnerish"". I have been doing TaeBo for three months and have tried out the Get Ripped Advanced tapes which are much more to my liking. These tapes are great for beginners, much more realistic of what beginners can accomplish than the Basic tape in the Live Series. The bottom line is, if you are a beginner Tae Bot, by all means buy these tapes. However, if you are looking for the cardio intensity similar to the Live series, these tapes will not deliver."
2,more of the same,"I worked with the original set of Tae Bo workouts many years ago and at the time they were pretty innovative and fun to use. Hearing many good things about this edition I gave it a shot and unfortunately, very little has changed except all the moves seem double-time making things really awkward and difficult to manuever. I quickly got bored with it and put it away. Its not very inspiring and I really didn't care for it."
4,Excellent Workout,"This is a great addition if you are currently a ""Tae-Bo"" hero. This really pumps up the cardio workout if your comparing to the original tae-bo series. The first workout is better then the second, but over-all it is worth the investment. I've been doing tae-bo for 2 years now and still love it!"
3,Easier than the regular Tae-bo Basic,"I started doing tae-bo more than a year ago, and then stopped after half a year. Started again recently and decided to order new tapes so I would not get bored easily.I was slightly disappointed with this 2-pack ""Get Ripped"", because one of the tapes is mostly just a ""on-the-floor"" work out, and I wanted more cardio, and the other tape is fine, but it is easier for me than the one I already have (Tae Bo Basic), I only use this new tape on the days when I am too tired for the workout in general, but want to pretend that I am doing ""something"". However in general, Tae-Bo really works for me, fast results!"
3,Not bad,"The gum is pretty good. Being made of natural products was a big seller for my wife. The only problem is the gum hardens quickly. And the pieces are very small. It takes ~3 pieces of Glee Gum to be the same size as a normal commercial piece of gum. The taste was good, but short lived. I probably won't buy it again."
4,"Good product, but flavor could last longer","Recently purchased both the tangerine and the peppermint flavor of Glee Gum, and found them to be pleasant-tasting, but not as long-lasting as I had hoped. But as a gum choice to avoid the shinanigans of the aspertame industry, this was a winner. An adult would probably use two tabs, at a time, and the flavor lasts around a half-hour or so. Tangerine is tasty."
1,no good i can't istall in the truck,"is like put you money in the thash, and i never get may money back, new is 50 , good luck"
5,Underappreciated gem.,"Recorded in the early 70's, Jazz purists will look down their collective noses at this disc as it presents Eddie Harris with some of the finest British rock musicians of their day. Chris Squire, Alan White, and Tony Kaye from Yes are accompanied by Steve Winwood, Jeff Beck and Albert Lee. Together they present a reflective, creative and enjoyable jazz-rock mix. Thankfully, it is definitely not typical fusion as there are no annoying, lightning fast, head splitting, runs, just lots of tasty, laid-back, thoughtful licks. This may not be Eddie Harris' finest hour but it is still a worthy addition to an eclectic musical library collection. Highly recommended...Simon."
4,jazzz rockk,"1 am looking for is it in on c-d alone. i saw it on c-d 3 years ago. it was a import . i should have got it when i first saw it. i brought e.h.in the uk/is it in .there is a problem sometime when you buy 2 on 1 c-ds. the problem is some songs are left off because of space. i had the album so i know this is true. make sure you check the songs listed. i hope someone can tell me of a website that is selling , is it in by eddie harris. thank-you."
2,Avoid it!,"Most of the ""In the U.K."" is only worth a listen for curiosity's sake. ""Look Ahere"" (from Is It In) is a neat take on the ""Listen Here"" melody. This selection is the only thing that elevates it to a 2-star rating. Some of the insane electric piano noodlings on the ""Is it In"" portion make me wonder how this ever got released. It really is THAT bad!"
4,Not tried yet...,"I am anxious to try them. It has been too cold here so far, and I am hoping they are not as difficult to find as some of the viewers describe."
2,week,"I had high hopes for this book. I hoped it would have more to do with the relationship between the Kabbalah and the minor arcana...but nope, the author just gives her subjective interpretations of the pictures without any real in-depth analysis from a Kabbalistic perspective. I wouldn't recomend it."
5,Birth Begins at Forty by Corinne Sweet,"This book is excellent. It is easy to read, full of true to life success stories and advice. It helped me to change my mindset from a negative one to a very postive one, which enabled me to move forward with my own difficult fertility issues.Great book for anyone who is struggling to think they will ever become a mother on reaching the age of forty. Corinne Sweet eliminates the myths around ageing women 'leaving it too late'.I read the book in a day!"
3,It's O.K.......Mike Weston (mweston),"fw: Two childhood best friends grow up and are still best friends at age 30, but now are both married, one to his first girlfriend. Their lives have become far more boring than they would like, and what were once jokes about wife swapping begin to be taken seriously, first by the men and eventually by the women, as a last act of wildness before becoming grownups.The comedy works fairly well, but the actors are not good enough to make the premise believable or to carry off the dramatic scenes. To the writers' credit, the complications that ensue are not simply the obvious ones. The film has high production values and it tied for the audience award at Cinequest (the San Jose, CA film festival) for best dramatic feature, so perhaps it has a chance of getting distribution. I saw it on 3/2/2002."
4,*One Of A Kind*,"I liked it because it was different.However,not everyone will like this.I think the movie did a great job of being realistic about the whole situation."
4,Splendily Written,"The Queen Must Die is an extremely well written look into the everyday happenings of the honey bee. The descriptions are wonderful and there is a lot of really cool and great information. Normally a non-fiction book like this will drag in many places but Longgood's beautiful way with words makes this a quick and joyful read. The only downside I had with the book was the redundancy of certain questions he poses throughout the book. However, that is a very minor issue for a book that offers so much wonderful insight. If your someone who finds honey bee's to be interesting and exciting then this a must read for you."
1,Don't bother!,"As a critic once said of humorist/musician Tom Lehrer, ""...plays piano acceptably."" So Mr. Longgood, who teaches writing, writes acceptably, at least stylistically. And he does betray some knowledge of bees and beekeeping, although his unreasoned anthropomorphising of them quite gets in the way of any real understanding, either on his part or that of his readers.Anyone who would like to understand bees, from either a practical or spiritual standpoint would do far better to read Dr. Richard Taylor's ""The Joys of Beekeeping"". Leave this dog to those misanthropes, sadly numerous, who must constantly apologize for their own existance."
4,The Fantastic World of Michael Crawford,"This DVD is excellent for anyone interested in Las Vegas and its shows and, of course, in Michael Crawford. There are a lot of scenes of the show EFX, back stage and from the show, and although the show opened in the 90s, the technology still seems amazing.Michael Crawford is his usual charming, talented, and versatile self and comments on his career and life up to EFX and on the show."
2,Not what i expected,"This dvd is mostly about las vegas and the EFX show, starring Michael Crawford. This film is not what i expected at all. A majority of it is about the efx show which is highly unknown. Plus, the plugs that are put in to promote Las Vega are just strange, especially when they show a clip of a nude pole dancer.... Have no idea why thats in there. They briefly refer to his other work and lightly touch on Phantom of the Opera which has to be his most popular and noteworthy work. All in all this film is confusing and would only refer it to die-hard crawford phans. He is interviewed throughout the whole film and he is simply enchanting."
1,"""I Wanna Know...","have you ever tried to lay an egg in a swamp?"" This is asked by a nun after a nude bodybuilder bends over and farts at her. This moment is topped when a stark-naked Sally Kirkland compares her breasts to ""bobbing, blood-shot eyes."" Interested yet? No? How about watching a scene in which a nude man masturbates in a bird cage? Good grief. As one reviewer noted, this is an original film. And in truth, I've never seen anything like it. And hope not to again. Ridiculous and tedious in every way imaginable, this is an unmitigated mess. I can easily believe it took years to make. The director and producers must have been turning in soda bottles for nickels because I can't imagine anyone would want to finance this with his own money."
4,Very well explained,"Many wonder about tissue damage in day to day life but really, has anyone ever imagined HOW it came about? This book explains to the very last molecule of hydrogen, what happens to your tissue. Fascinating as it is, it is also very complicated to understand. The chapters are not ordered in the most easiest way to read and comprehend but overall, the content is superb. I'd recommend this book to any scientist at any level."
4,Bone's First Live DVD,"Great dvd, but far from perfect. Bizzy is missing from a couple of the shows, obviously Flesh is also missing since he's locked up. It's bootleg videos, so the quality ain't that great. Includes a music video of Money, Money, but I'm not sure why they didn't also include Home from the Thug World Order album. The backstage and behind-the-scenes footage shows the true side of Bone.Worth picking up if you're a fan of Bone. The best parts are the MTV Awards singing Tha Crossroads and the celebrity shout-outs."
3,IT WAS DOPE,"this dvd is good, but the quality is crap, the video is hot, and the best preformance is the Thuggish Ruggish bone Prformance at the source awards, if you are abig bone fan go out and get this, if your not, get it any way,anyone who likes rap will think this is hot-HOLLa"
2,These cats just lip sing....,I'm a huge Bone fan and I expected a great DVD and it has many performances but the catch is that THEY LIP SING on all there performances. So when they perform on stage they basically sound the same as our CD's we have of them. The only performance that they actually rap in this DVD is the 1996 MTV Awards and you can clearly tell the difference. But to Bone's credit that performance was hot because they actually did rap. If it wasn't for that great performance this would've got 1 star. And the backstage seens were short and worthless basically. So even if your a huge Bone fan its not really worth it cause of the reasons mentioned....
5,Cool Album,"What is ""Virtuosity""? The dictionary defines it as a musician having supurb technical skill at their craft. After listening to this album, by one of America's top gospel artist, I concur with the decision of dubbing this album as having ""Virtuosity"".The album opens with a subtle but deceptively intricate introduction, ""We're Virtue"". It then explodes to, one of my favorite grooves, ""He's been good"". The entire album is very enjoyable to listen to and should be sought after by every fan of contemporary christian music."
5,Sorry I have more!,"I'm back! I just wanted to say I understand what some of you are saying about this album. It sounds different because the managers have Virtue doing more R&B songs then before because the obviously wanted Virtue to be more appealing to the R&B world. They know Virtue has Extreme vocals but they are thinking about money and not God or Virtue. So I Do understand but as long as they are lifting up jesus' name and aren't acting the world then do critize. they are the same group you fell in love with, it just they went through some changes. Life is change! At least they're doing what God called them to do and they're doing it unlike some who try to fit in with world instead of begin original. I won't say names BEBE! Why would you do that?! I mean R&B and Pop singers copy Gospel anyway."
4,virtue - comes to those who wait!,"Yes the line up may have changed and even the style of dress but the message is still the same - Christ. Giving no props, MTV Base plays good beats, now why shouldn'd God have some? after all, all blueprints belong to him, The next generation needs something to relate to. The vocals are tight, the beats phat and yes the girls do look good but remember its all for Christ, so listeners quit knockin and support the ministry. And if you don't like this....then go buy some Gaither,(no offence meant Gaither). An excellent album!"
4,A DOG'S TALE,It was pretty goodIt's not what I would 've expectedFor 5-12 is pretty good guessI liked it.
1,"Good Marketing, Poor Theology","Barna is marketing expert and very good at it. However, applying this to church growth is tragic error.I find no support Biblically for the positions he makes. Further critique may be found in my book, Testing the Claims of Church Growth.Dangerous principles to be brought into the church of Jesus Christ."
2,I don't understand!,"I purchased this hat for an Alaskan cruise and land trip this summer. Since I had read alot about it be very rainy along the coast, I wanted a good waterproof hat to wear with a wide brim. The hat looks nice but has one major flaw...it has a hole in it! It's similar to the back of a baseball hat where you can adjust the fit...only its a little higher on this hat. Why do you make a waterproof hat with a hole designed into it? It would be perfect for a pony tail...if I had one. Otherwise I would just have a wet spot on my head about the size of a fifty cent piece and a trail of water down my back. But this hat for sun protection but not for use in rainy weather."
3,Mouse OK but keyboard has issues.,"I own two of these keyboards and on the overall, it is ok. The main problem that BOTH have is range for one (as mentioned by another reviewer) and the fact that they seem to have an issue with holding the ctl or shift key while selecting files.Many times I have been in the process of selecting files by holding the CTL and clicking on the mouse only to look and see all my selections go away as the keyboard just 'lets go' of the ctl key while I am still holding it.Also not very good for gaming at all for the same reason. The keys will just 'let go' even though you have not."
5,Milwaukee battery charger,"The price was right, delivery time was excellent and the product exceeds my expectations. What more could any customer want! I am very satisfied with every aspect of this transaction. Thanks so much!"
5,It does it's job.,it just works. Lights up red when charging - green when finished. I have had about 6 months without any problems. Gotta have it if you're upgrading from the junk nicd's. The Li-ion batteries are superior in every way.
1,Worked Once,"I replaced my old Ni-Cads with the V18 battery. I ordered this charger from Amazon October of 2011. I charged the V18 battery once. The battery shows a half charge March 2012, I put the battery in the charger and nothing, no lights, no hum, totally dead. I will now see how well Milwaukee honors there 5 year warranty. Should be NO STARS."
1,It worked...once.,"Bought this in late December to replace a lost OEM charger that came with combo tool kit purchased from a ""big box"" retailer in 2004. I immediately charged an ""empty"" battery, left the charger on a shelf and used the tool a handful of times until last week when discovering the charger wouldn't produce a second charging cycle. No indicator lights, no humming, no heat, no nothing. Dead.I'd give it ""0"" stars if I could figure out how. It's proven itself 40-some dollars worth of junk."
1,Not worth it,Got this charger to replace my existing one. It died after about two months and now got a set of tools as door stops. If your in need of charger for 18 volt just save money and upgrade to new lithium system.
3,"It works, kind of.","I bought this charger to replace the one I got with my Sawzall that I bought back in '89. It doesn't get a lot of use, but when I need it, I really need it.The description says that it's compatible with all Milwaukee 18 Volt batteries, this isn't exactly true. The 48-11-2100 (18 Volt Power Plus) batteries I got with my Sawzall won't fit unless I put the charger on the edge of a shelf, the batteries are too long and won't connect with the charger if it's on a flat surface. Once I get the battery to connect, it charges the battery just fine."
4,Great Charger,No problems so far. A little big. Make sure your batteries have not been recalled by Milwaukee.
5,Fast charger,"I have the older batteries(18 volt) along with a new Lithium Ion one. This Charger is able to charge both styles. From the literature it is able to recondition the older batteries to work better. So far the only downside if you can call it that is my teenage son can hear it squealing as it charges batteries. I can't hear it but I guess the teens can. Maybe another potential use, to chase the kids out on a nice day!"
5,Great Product,Great Product!!! I have both the 18 - Volt and 28 Volt Batteries and this charger comes in very handy
5,I needed a second charger...,"Already owning several Milwaukee cordless tools, when I upgraded to Li-Ion, I wanted to take the rest of my tools as well. The only problem is when you purchase the upgrade batteries, you need a new charger as well.In this case I needed a charger for work to match the new one for home. Well Amazon.com came to the rescue."
4,"Just like the V batteries, this is much improved","With this charger, I purchased a V18 battery pack to replace my badly aged 18 volt NiCad packs. I ordered one battery which I find to be a huge improvement over the old NiCad packs.The charger is much improved as well - packs that the old charger would not recognize now charge. The only negative is that the charger only charges 18 volt and 28 volt batteries. With the good quality of the new charger and battery pack, I'm looking forward to getting more of the Milwaukee V tools."
1,There is a problem here!,"You buy a battery driven power tool and somewhere along the line the battery or the charger go bad. So you shop around and find out that you can buy a new tool with the battery and charger included for price cheaper than the cost of a replacement battery and charger! Excuse me, but that isn't logical, even from a marketing standpoint.So, you shop and shop and finally find replacement battery and charger for a reasonable price at Amazon and they go bad too. Milwaukee needs to design a battery and charger that actually last, even with intermittent use, or get out of that business!"
1,does not work with all milwaukee batteries,Item states that it works with all milwaukee 18-28v batteries but it does not work with milwaukee 18v lithium ion 48-11-1828 battery. They even try to sell the 48-11-1828 battery with the charger.
1,GARBAGE,"Skip this one. The beats are lame and simple. The lyrics are the same on each song: ""I sex lots of chicks and I'm nasty."" There's a reason Celph Titled can't hold an album down himself. DO NOT BUY"
4,Paw Pro Spray,"This product works pretty well with our Golden Retriever who hates to wear booties in the winter. While she tries to lick it off when we're applying it and it does usually wear off before we're done a walk, it helps tremendously with the constant ice balls she gets on her feet! I wish the container were larger so it would last longer."
3,Good but not Great!!!!!,"It's not a great album but it's worth buying. It has lots of club joints. If you're a Ruff Ryder fan you will like this CD but if you're not you could do without. Hot Tracks: Feel My Pain, Respect My Gangsta f/Styles, Tell Your Friends f/Jadakiss, Put Your Drinks Down, and Holla At Your Boy."
5,Classic Material,"For anybody out there that don't know, drag-on can flow. I've been listening to Hip-Hop, Rap, whatever you wanna call it, since I was a young boy, and this dude right here has the best style of rap. I love the way he dragz his flow when he spits. Production wise, I think this album(Hell& Back) is better than his last album(Opposite of H20). I would definitely give it five mics. I consider an album to be a classic when you can play it till you get sick of it, put it down for a minute, then come back to it and do it again. All drag needs to do is, expand his vocab and he'll be up there with Nas & Kurrupt. Has anyboby heard that track he made called ""The Race""? If so, email me and let me know what's it from because it's not on his album and on the Ruffryders site it has it posted as a sample as if it's from his lastest album. So, let me know, ONE!!!!!!!! Tgrannywig@msn.com"
5,UNDERATED,"Drag-On Is the best Ruff Ryder fo sho'. This C-D is full of wicked beatz that THUMP and hes a good lyricist as well, buy it bitch!"
3,Dr Ashby gets it *almost* right....,"Dr. Muata Ashby, who gave us such titles as ""Egyptian Yoga"" has actually done pretty well in attempting to put out a book about the Ancient Egyptian (Kemetic) view of health and healing. There are a few things which I find to rather sloppy scholarship. It would be nice, if after all this time, he would cite the authors and actual passages of his ""Ancient Egyptian Proverbs"" that he quotes throughout the book. Also the picture of the ""Imhotep Pharmacy"" at the temple of Aset (Isis) at Philae on page 28 is a bit over the top. His intentions, however are good, and most anyone can get something from the book as it outlines good eating and living habits. This however, is certainly not the end all be all when studying health and medicine of Ancient Egypt."
4,Fun and entertaining NASCAR game,"This is probably about the 10th Nascar related game I've played. It isn't very different than the last few. I guess the improvements are graphics wise as well as the sound. It is a fun game, don't get me wrong. There is a beat the heat feature in while you start on a track in a certain scenario (ex. 15th place with 3 laps to go, and you need to finish in the top three to move on), that is very challenging and fun. If you don't own any other NASCAR games, this wouldn't be a bad one to start with."
4,Hasbro throws down.....look out Papy.,"I just played the demo and am now about to pre-order the game. And what a game it is. The graphics are excellent. Very smooth flowing on my Celeron 500 at 1024x768 with all details on. The physics are awesome, made by the same people that created Viper Racing true race fans won't be dissapointed. The car acts like it should and at times rolls with a big enough crash. The AI is very aggressive. Multiplayer wasn't availible in the demo so hopefully it will be as strong as the rest of this game."
5,Angela Hunt is good.,"Hartford is an excellent book in the Keepers of the Ring series. It gives a whole new outlook on what the Indians and the white people went through as this country was born.Angela Hunt is an excellent writer, there does not seem to be any lag time. She keeps things interesting all through the book."
4,Interesting Read,"This is one of the few young adult novels that discusses a girl's first experience with menstruation. While the protagonist in this novel is only ten she experience this coming of age event and discusses her feelings of uncertainty and fear. Also broached in this novel is how two friends can suddenly grow apart and develop different interests, The main character is fearful of being labeled a ""girly girl"" by her former best friend and attempts to shed herself of all that is female, i.e. dolls, stuffed animals and her changing body. It's a good novel for mothers and daughter to read together in order to discuss how a female child's body will change as she approaches her adolescence."
2,I'm disappointed,"This album has always been my favorite by any group. The sound quality on Rhino's ""remastered"" edition is pitiful. My belief is that they played an old 33 1/3 and recorded it, since there are even skips in the CD version!"
3,Chicago II Review,"I have owned many versions of this recording. I am afraid to purchase the new Rhino one though because all of the others were substandard. Chicago II is a great album musically, and I have enjoyed it for years. It just isn't up to their own standard, recording-wise. I have tried to find out why Chicago II was not recorded well, but have been unable to get any information. Even Chicago I was recorded better, much better."
4,Hits and stuff,"Chicago 2: There are a few huge hits here and it is an enjoyable album, but it is not their best. The album tries to split its theme between social awareness and romantic love but fails to reach us with either and as a result, it lacks the passion and the focus of their first album. This is one I like, but not love. A solid four-star release."
4,Their Best By Far,"Chicago made three decent albums and then went downhill fast after the death of their best songwriter. The ""Make Me Smile"" suite is a highlight, as are ""Fancy Colours"" and the other single, ""25 or 6 to 4."" (Hey, it only took me 15 years to get that this song is about a guy who's awake at 3:34 or 3:35 a.m.) I also liked the closer (of the original record), ""Where Do We Go From Here?"" But in retrospect that songs sounds a little too much like their future singles, most of which are abominations on the face of the earth. Anyway, get this if you want a little meat to go with your cheese."
4,For Me Chicago's Best,"I'm not a big band or Jazz super enthusiast, but in truth this is really a Rock Band with big instrumentation. To me this is their best I liked CTA but II is really up there the vocals are powerful it is almost a thematic album with such powerful numbers as Make Me Smile and Color My World. This is the place to really start and put them on par with the likes of the great Canadian group Lighthouse. Highly recommended."
5,Chicago II,This album/CD was along with the original Chicago Transit Authority work the very best of CHICAGO. The music will transcend not only decades but perhaps many many decades to come!
1,"Great Album, Horrible Sound Quality!","The sound quality of this CD is really bad. It sounds like a copy of a really bad copy that was copied from a really bad copy. I urge anyone who is sincerely interested in owning this amazing album to get their hands on the DVD-A version. You will be amazed at how good the DVD-A sounds. It sounds like a fresh recording. This is because the CD was made from a really worn out tape, and the DVD-A is made from the original, better preserved master tapes. The fact that this CD and the DVD-A were released by the same company is one of the biggest anomalies I have come across in all my years of collecting music.Just to clarify based on some replies to my review; The sound quality comparisons I made go far, far beyond the expected differences in sound quality between the CD and DVD-A formats. Listen and compare for yourself if you must. You will be appalled!"
5,"Here's why ""Chicago"" will never sound better than now","I've already reviewed CHICAGO (scroll downwards) hence the 5 star rating. I just want to clear up the negativity about the ""bad"" sound - there is a reason. Sometime in the 1970's, there was a fire at Caribou Studios in Colorado (where all the Chicago master tapes were kept) and out of all the Chicago albums, THIS ONE saw its master tape destroyed. Yes - gone. Hence, the dub of the master tape that appears on the CD. If there was a better sounding tape, Rhino and Chicago would have found it by now (after all it's 2003) and used it here. I'm sure they regret it, but there you are. So if you're waiting for the 1st generation copy of CHICAGO to appear on CD, you'll be waiting forever. Like Terry Kath, it is gone. However, the sound isn't THAT bad and at least the production team had the foresight to make reference dubs of the album. To quote Mick & Keith: ""You can't always get what you want"", but you'll get what you NEED here. Cheers..."
4,"Listen to the music, not the remastering","This album brings back a lot of memories. My memories didn't include a compressed soundstage and anemic high-end, though, so I pulled out the old vinyl to compare. The sound of the LP is just as compressed and dull as this CD release (and the Chicago Records single-CD release of a few years back). My guess is that a better sounding master either doesn't exist or hasn't been located yet.Otherwise, it's a great album, and we shouldn't expect that every recording made 30+ years ago can be spruced up to sound like it was recorded last week."
3,Great Songs with Bad Filler = Mixed Bag,"So, why do you want to purchase this album? Have a scratched LP copy? Interested in the wonderful music Chicago produced? If so, then here's the plusses and minuses of this purchase. This review is *not* designed to pass judgment on the band as a whole, just about this purchase.This album has great Chicago songs: Wake Up Sunshine, So Much to Say, So Much to Give, Colour My World, Fancy Colours, 25 or 6 to 4...and over the middle stretch of this originally four sided LP, the album has a thematic structure like a rock opera. Unfortunately, the entire first side (from Moving In to In the Country) has no redeeming value. One boring song after another. Side four (It Better End soon and Where Do We Go From Here) isn't listenable either -- both make lame excuses for Vietnam era songs. If you can't get the great songs any other way, then get this CD."
5,Still A Great One,"I got this album on my 10th birthday and promptly wore it out. Whatever you think of the MOR machine that Chicago became after Terry Kath died and Peter Cetera took over, and the lack of originality they displayed in naming the vast majority of their albums with simple volume numbers, none of this is evident here. I eventually bought this album again on CD, and it sounds as great as ever. Incredibly accomplished guitar-playing, powerhouse drumming, and terrific orchestral arrangements (showing both their jazz and classical influences) are all displayed here on this, their best album."
4,Chicago II the way it was meant to be heard...,"For those of you familiar with the phrases 8-track tape, vinyl record, and cassette tape, this 5.1 surround sound mix is finally the way one of Chicago's best efforts was meant to be heard. The clarity and separation between the instruments and voices is like hearing it for the first time again. Although this isn't the best 5.1 DVD-A in my collection, it is well worth the price for any Chicago fan. Definitive good sounds from one of the best jazz/rock acts of all time."
3,Good book,"I bought this book hoping to learn about teaching methods for a foreign language class. This book didn't do that. However, it still has some good ideas and the web site references it offers are excellent."
4,That sexy 90's music,"One of my favorite songs ever, and I am glad to have finally found it. I have been looking for it a long time now. I should have gone threw amazon a long time ago. If, you like that 90's sexy sound, and you miss it like me then this cd is a must have. Get into it, and relax it's all good."
5,"Not Marillion, but still great","Steve Hogarth (H) has made a gem of an album with ""Ice Cream Genius."" While it doesn't sound much like Marillion, it still hits the listener like any Marillion album would. It might take a few listens, but it is great. Buy it!!!!!"
1,B/O,"Le produit étais B/O j'ai annulé la commande car il ne pouvait pas me le livré dans les temps requis.Il ne livrais pas au Québec, Canada"
3,a reasonably-good crime thriller,"MAN IN THE VAULT, produced by John Wayne's Batjac production company, is a well-paced and impressively-cast crime thriller, which reunited ""High and the Mighty"" co-stars William Campbell and Karen Sharpe.Tommy Dancer (William Campbell) is an unemployed professional locksmith, forced into assisting a daring bank raid, after his girlfriend Betty (Karen Sharpe), a feisty society debutante, is swept up into the plot.Filled with some great performances, MAN IN THE VAULT is an enjoyable excursion into a shady world of corruption and greed, and never wears out it's brisk 70-minute running time. Both William Campbell and Karen Sharpe are attractive and well-used in the leads; with Anita Ekberg, Paul Fix and Barry Kroeger in strong supporting roles."
3,It's ok for the price,It's not really as it's pictured. It's made a lot thinner and a bit difficult to put on and very painful if you happen to bump your ear with it on.
5,blindside the bully,Bad books on bullying resolve the conflict by having the bully pledge eternal friendship after receiving Algebra (or English or History) lessons from the bullied. There are a lot of bad books about bullying out there. This isn't one of them. Highly recommended to be read aloud with a child on your lap.
1,I Do Not REcommend it to anybody. trust me,The product is not has good at the tell you. 1st the cd is a mini CD thats just wont play in any DVD or CDrom. For example. i do not have a dvd player only my macbook pro it won't that kind of cd. 2nd the yoyo is like unresponsive when it should be. i recommend the FH Zero thats the man of yoyos. this one do not waist your money.
4,This is an excellent book for student pilots!,"Having been a flight instructor, I have recommended this book to all of my students. It is well written, easy to follow, and is full of information that will definitely benefit student pilots as they progress through their training."
3,Flight Training Handbook Replaced!,"This is a great title -- better than the 3 stars. But, it's recently been replaced by the FAA. The new volume is called the ""Airplane Flying Handbook"" and is apparently not yet available through Amazon.com"
5,Great Calendar,"It is a great calendar for a family of 4. Each member of our family has a color sticker. When entering an event, we use the stickers and when looking at the calendar one quickly knows who has anything happening on a given day. It is great! We love it!"
4,awesome,This book is very easy to follow. It has very creative ideas and the final product is very nice.
4,he is alive and well,"It has been my first contact with Mose and the experience has been excellent. This is a 2 records cd of very good jazz and blues. Two songs stand out in the cd, ""smashed"" and ""I Love The Life I Live"". I like it!"
1,Whoever said lil' bratz are little snotz is right.,"I will not buy Lil' Bratz because I have to agree,Lil' Bratz ARE snots."
1,Stop bashing!!!!!!!!!,look i think that if you people bash each other then obviously your the ones that don't have a real life. And you know what this is a free country we can like whatever doll we want. and also stop cussing. and also if you guys keep bashing each other your not going to accomplish anything all your doing is making the myscene or bratz fans want to dis you and the dolls you like. so stop being so immature and get a life. all dolls are cool including gi-joe.
2,yes. I 'WROTE LI'L SNOTS' (And proud of it),Nazlia is a horrid name and I DO have a life. Unlike Bratz fans. All THEY do is SAY LIES ABOUT Myscenes. You JUST proved my theory. (Whoever wrote 'What's wrong with you'). My theory is that bratz dolls make fans of them VERY agressive and RUDE!!!!!!!!!!!! Even though I don't like Bratz I still think it is harsh that parents bash Bratz. They also bash Myscene some-times too. Stick up for your dolls. Bratz have big lips...OH MY GOSH!!!!!!Myscene do TOO!!!!!!!!Myscene lips aren't AS big though.
3,not the best,"foils don't seem to last long thinking of getting a new razor other than Panasonic,waiting for a good sale on Braun or norelco."
5,Long lasting,This foil seems to last 18-24 months with a thick beard and does not wear down at the end of its life. Good product.
5,cool toy,i like the toy because he has a cat and he has very cool clothes i love everything about this toy it rox and iam 5 my brother is typing this for me
1,Worst Cameron Ever,"I like the idea of Punk Bratz, but could you at least make them modern punk, and this is the uglies cameron ever made. don't buy it. its so ugly it looks like justin timberlake got messed up on the brain."
1,Advice for the fearful!,"This book was terrible, maybe the worst book I have read on investing. It was so basic I felt like I was in pre-school learning how to tie my shoes. It's a book for whimps who are full of fear and are too scared to do anything with their live's. There is even a section warning you not to use drugs. Come on..... Don't waste your money.........."
4,Great Game!!!,"I bought this game beacuase my son wanted to play his Battleship game all the time but he always had trouble keeping track of his shots and either he or the person that he was playing with always got angry because things werent going the way they thought they were, LOL. Well I got this game for him and he doesn't have to keep track of anything he just plays and gets some action along with it. He loves it."
5,"An insight into king makers, just follow the money","This book will give the reader a very easy to understand description of how merchant banking started and the power those same families wield today.If you have trouble understanding why a lot of things are happening that don't seem to make sense, read this old book and apply your new knowledge to our so called modern economics and government spending."
5,CRYSTAL!,This book once again earns five stars!This book is so awesome because Marvin is going to Casey's house!That's so weird.Casey invited him over to look at something.(And I thought he hated her.)At the end something REALLY weird happens.SO READ IT AND FIND OUT!!
4,week in the woods review,"I like the book ""Week in the woods"" because it reminds me of camping. My favorite part is when Mark goes into the woods by himself because it was a big part in the story. Anyone who likes survival or adventure should read this book. I recommend this book to anyone who likes survival because I rated it a four star."
2,Very SLOW and drawn out...,I got this book for my 5th grade son hoping to get him more interested in reading. The cover looked great but the book was barely about the week in the woods. I read the whole thing to him and was bored to tears but finished it anyway. They don't even leave for the trip until after half of the book is over. My son kept getting bored and I tried skipping some of the descriptive parts that were just far too much. This could have been a good story had it actually been in the woods like the title states.
4,Tania's Books Review,"A boy named Mark Has just moved to New Hampshire. He has been there for almost to weeks and he hasnt made any friends. All the kids at school think he's a stuck up rich kid, but not his science teacher Mr.Maxwell. He liked Mark he thought he was a very smart boy. Mark is supposed to go camping in the woods for a week with the whole 6th grade. But he doesnt want to go.Will Mark make any friends,will he go camping? Well you got to read the book and find out! I really liked this book because it shows how hard it is for kids to move to a new place."
2,A good book,"I would recommend this book to a fourth, fifth, or maybe even a sixth grader, because firstly, it was a page turner, where you were left wondering what was going to happen next, because Mark is a very unpredictable character. I did enjoy this genre; a suspenseful, adventure, but it got a bit corny for me, being a 7th grader, because often times, I wondered if Mark was a stupid kid, in a very fake way. This is because you would think that he would have the common sense to do the right thing, but he does something so ridiculous, its fake. Such as not checking his compass at the worst time, even though in every other part of the story, he remembers. But, for some people, this incident might not bother them, and they may enjoy the story very much. Besides that, I thought that it was a very enjoyable story."
3,Ok,This book is a pretty good book overall but I don't really recomend it. It pretty much doesn't have to do with the Topic (a week in the woods) for half the book
3,"good, but a little lame","This book was okay. It had a lot of interesting parts, but way more boring parts. It has a lot of interesting parts like when Mr. Maxwell gave Mark a permission slip to go to something called A Week In The Woods. I wondered what was going to happen to Mark in A Week In The Woods. The boring part is about 100 pages long. That is why it is more boring than good. It is really boring when Mark escapes from Mr. Maxwell's truck and then Mr. Maxwell is looking for Mark, and then Mark is trying to run away from Mr. Maxwell, but then decides to find Mr. Maxwell, and then it's like 40 more pages until they meet up. When you are reading the boring part, you will wonder when will this be over! I would say it's an okay book to buy if you love Andrew Clements' books."
2,Outdated information,"I have NOT read every word of this book, but after watching, analyzing, and investing in the wireless telecomm market over the last 2 years, I can tell you that this information is a great view of what HAS happened. It will not tell you where things are going."
3,A little disappointed,"The choices were okay, not great. I found the picture on the video cover misleading. The particular pas de deux featured from the Prince of the Pagodas is not actually included in the video so I don't know why it is on the cover. The choice of dancers and ballets leaves a lot to be desired. I have seen better performances of some of the ballets by other dancers. Overall, this collection feels more like a promotional video than one of historical or artistic significance. The collection includes: ""Spring Waters"" Bylova and Nikonov. ""Le Corsaire"" Fonteyn and Nureyev. ""The Prince of the Pagodas"" Bussell and Cope. ""Swan Lake"" Cooper and Ambler. ""Romeo and Juliet"" Ferri and Eagling. ""Nutcracker"" Collier and Dowell. ""Manon"" Penney and Dowell. ""Swan Lake"" Makhalina and Zelensky. ""A Month in the Country"" Makarova and Dowell. ""Le Corsaire"" Asylmuratova and Neff. ""Spartacus"" Mukhamedov and Bessmertova. ""The Sleeping Beauty"" Kolpakova and Berezhnoi. ""Don Quixote"" Havey and Baryshnikov."
5,"Great Pas de Deux - Fonteyn, Nureyev, Makarova, Dowell, Baryshnikov and more","An excellent selection for the serious follower of ballet. Only the cream of the cropare represented here dancing some of the most exciting pas de deux on record. If you loveballet, you will love this."
3,"dancing good, audio bad","No doubt, the dancing is superb. However, most ballets were recorded some time ago; consequently the audio is generally not very good. One selection is awful: The Nutcracker. Both the quality of the film and the audio are bad. One wonders why they included it on the DVD. Nevertheless for a lover of ballet this DVD is worthwhile purchasing."
3,A bit disappointed,"The title of this video, ""Great Pas De Deux"" was apt for most of the dancing. I was disappointed, however, when the editors of this video chose as the exemplar of ""Swan Lake"", my favorite ballet, a ""gay"" version of the ballet with both leads danced by men. What a let down! I would not recommend this video."
1,"Blindsided by the gay ""Swan Lake""","I was shocked to see Tchaikovsky's classic danced exclusively by males. One reviewer felt that the result was a ""human""-- not merely ""romantic""-- ballet. I saw it as a travesty of Swan Lake. We all know that gays have contributed much to ballet, but Nureyev danced with Fonteyn in the pas de deux from Le Corsaire. A gay agenda should not trump artistic integrity. The superb pas de deux by Yulia Makhalina and Igor Zelensky in the other selection from Swan Lake did not remove the bad taste left by Adam Cooper and Scott Ambler."
2,2.5 but not 3,"This has many duplications from the superior collection ""Rock and Rollin/Million Sellers"" They are the best cuts, and if you don't have that one, this is a fair substitute. It does contain Blueberry Hill (if you need it; it's hardly my favorite) and My Blue Heaven, but overall, the other collection has better ""other"" songs besides the many they share.No Fats collection is uninteresting; the man defined the R&B sound for a long time. He could swing and sing. Listen to a sample (or if you can find it, the relative obscurity I'm Gonna Be A Wheel Someday) and you'll hear his sound. But overall, it just doesn't measure up to the alternative."
4,Janis,"Even though she was one of my favorite artists, I felt I got to know a lot more about her by reading this book."
4,Excellent and Intimate Perspective,"There are other titles on Janis Joplin, but Laura Joplin's book is a different view given by a sister who writes from her perspective of family. Other authors offerings give the details of the well-known lifestyle of rockers from the 60's, and early 70's. This well written book with many family photos shows the early Janice growing up to be the legend she became. Ultimatly a sad ending for a great talent who didn't have the forsight to make better decisions for a long and successful future. A good read!"
3,Clinical and dettached,"For being written by a sister, this book seems very detached, as if Laura didn't really know her sister at all, and the information and antecdotes were collected posthumously from Janice's friends. It could have been written by anyone, I expected something more familiar."
5,"Love, Janis was a great book that everyone should read.","Love, Janis was a book about a Texas woman's struggle, rise to fame, and terribly disapointing end. I loved Love, Janis because it was written by Janis's sister, Laura, so you know the details are accurate. It was very informative, interesting and real. It tells about Janis's feelings and even about her family history, back in the 1800's and before. I would think that anybody, especially those who like Janis (like me), should read it. Sure, it talks about Janis, but it also mentions lots of big musical names and how Janis was involved with them. If you like Love, Janis, I think you would like a book called The Tightrope Walker, by Dorothy Gilman. It's written really well and I think you'd like it."
3,"A good biography, but not more.","Slightly disappointing-it seems that Laura has used the same sources as any other Joplin biographist-I have expected something more from Janis`s sister. However, if you want to get a good overview of her life, both professional and private, you have to read this. The positive thing: love and understanding filters through the lines and makes them somehow personal and touching-in spite of the commonplaces. It can not be easy to write about a dead sister, facing the dark side of her personality as well, and here a nice effort has been done."
3,Poorly written but rich with moments,"Laura is no Balzac. She doesn't share the reality of her sister's life in a way that makes it as important and real the way a master would. But, what can a person expect? She does share and reveal much. It's way too much to ask that she (Laura) could write a book that truly reveals the depths of Janis' life and times such that it will influence people for ages to come. I would like such a work because I feel that Janis' life should not be forgotten. If you have feelings for Janis like I do then this book is a must read. If someone someday takes what Laura has written and makes it into a book that captures all of the emotion and reality of Janis' life and times so that even a casual reader will be amazed then that will be an amazing book. I think Laura would agree."
5,Great Bio,"This an excellent biography about the ENTIRE life of Janis Joplin. It is probably the first Janis Joplin book you should read if you want to learn more about her. It is told from a family member's point of view...in other words, the truth is told. I would think that this book would be the most reliable out of the 4 or 5 janis books that are out. Enjoy this book! it is well worth it."
3,Simon House & Rod Goodway - 'House Of Dreams' (Black Widow) 3 1/2 stars,"Not sure if this title is of a one-time project or not. Either way, it's a nice sounding progressive piece of work. Similar to the music of Simon House's (Hawkwind, Third Ear Band) mid-'90's outfit, Spiral Realms. I've never even heard of vocalist Rod Goodway ( Magic Muscle, Ethereal Counterbalance) before. Better than House's 'Yassasim' (see my review). Best cuts are the contemporary sounding ""Country Charm"", the inventive ""Fancy"", ""The Reapers Whistle"", ""Shadow Hand"" and the title track ""House Of Dreams"". Very well produced and arranged CD. One can REALLY here Simon's violin playing wail. House plays all the instruments and Goodway provides the lyrics & vocals. Good Italian import."
5,Another side of Bob Dylan,"A classic! Part of history! This is some of Dylan's best work. I recommend it, especially if you are a Dylan fan already."
4,Another Side of Bob Dylan,"The best song on the album is My Back Pages, one of his best songs and certainly his best acoustic tune. The hidden meaning is the key here. Basically, he's looking back at his protest period and saying something along the lines of, ""I was wrong, I was jumping into conclusions"". Another great tune is Chimes of Freedom, featuring some of his best songwriting. I also enjoy It Ain't Me Babe, the album's best-known tune, and the laugh-out-loud hilarity of I Shall Be Free No. 10. The final masterwork to be found here is Ballad of Plain D. I don't care how much the rest of the Dylan-listening world hates this track, I find it quite enjoyable. Other than the falsetto, All I Really Want to Do is a great track. And if you want a fresh dose of surreal humor, go after Motorpsycho Nitemare. Even though Black Crow Blues and To Ramona are not among Bob's best material, this is still worth several listens. If you like acoustic Dylan, you will probably love this!"
5,Another side/A great mix,"Another Side of Bob Dylan is one of Bob's most poetic and humorous albums.From the talking blues of ""I shall be free #10"",the poetic beauty of ""To Ramona"" and the classic ""It ain't me babe"",this diverse and excellent album is a given for any Bob Dylan fan."
4,A must have for any Dylan fan,"Any Dylan fan, or anyone who wishes to hear some of his best, must have this album. If the rest of the album were poor, which it is not, it would still rank as a great listen because of My Back Pages and Chimes of Freedom. The former, especially, may have been Dylan's greatest composition. This is a song that second guesses the youthful exuberance that defined the 60s generation and made it blind to any other perspective. How did Dylan write this song when he was, what, only 25 or so himself."
3,Not 5 Stars-but You Can't Help But Love It,"Some people like to criticise Dylan for leaving part of the story untold. For instance, a customer wrote of ""Ballad in Plain D,"" ""What happened to break up the relationship anyway? Dunno. . ."" I geuss some people like everything to be spelled out for them in uncomplicated words. I guess they have no imagination. Don't they get it? That's Dylan's genious. He let's the audience connect to the song.""Another Side"" is a rocky album. But it's warm and honest. Songs of pain and songs of down right funnyness fill the album. So yes it's true, the album isn't smooth. If it was there would have to be 10 stars."
1,Masterpiece? Perhaps Not.,"Sorry, I must be honest: ths is Not a masterpiece.I own many Bob Dylan albums, and I really like him, but this is -by far - my least favorite album of his.The whole album lacks melody. The lyrics are good, but the songs are long, even tough the songs are incredibly boring.The big problem is, you cannot say No to this album, because you're suffering in a really curious disease: you must say Masterpiece, to anything, you think you'll like, and this is Terrible!Let's face it: musically the album is weak, you must admit it. A little accoustic guitar and a bit of harmonica cannot satisfy me.Sorry boys & girls, I must take heart against your fury & your 'Not-helpful-review-voting-angry-mouse-clicking': this album is a BIG MUCKER."
3,Early Dylan,"I bought ""Another Side of Bob Dylan"" for 2 songs, ""All I Really Want To Do"" which is so bad it's good and ""It Ain't me Babe"". For most of this CD Bob sounds like he is in a lot of pain. If you liked Freewheelin' and The Times They Are A-Changin' you will probably like this, if your into Dylans electric music you might want to skip this one, it's early folk music and sounds like adnoid country music."
4,OK But A Little Boring,"This album contains many great congs and a few losers. All I Really Want To Do is almost unlistenable while Chimes of Freedom, My Back Pages and It Ain't Me Babe are Dylan classics. Overall a little boring but a good listen - too bad there a few clunkers that really take it down."
5,Great book for Kids,I am a second grade teacher who is doing a unit on bats. I ordered this book used. It came in a very timely manner in excellent consdition. It is very appropriate for kids curious about bats. Second graders can read it on thier own with a minimum of help. There are also great photographs.
5,Most excellent,"This record holds some of the best renditions of the best of Cash. If you're a fan and own a record player, this is a must-have."
1,Everything is canned.,"All of the first few recipes I looked at involved opening cans. Fresh products are more healthy. While the book is concerned about sugar, it ignores other things, notably sodium. I tossed it."
5,Underestimated,After reading all the reviews on several different brad combinations I went with the Stanley Bostich. All the negative complaints such as wheels falling off (an impossibility with the current design) and that jams are hard to clear and time consuming (it takes about 2 seconds to open the magazine and remove the brads). There is only one complaint that was legitimate and that is getting up against the compressor that is hot and getting burnt. This too is almost an impossibility as only a minute portion of the compressor is not shielded by the plastic housing. The only complaint I can see is the noise of the compressor but in real use the compressor takes forever to kick on and doesn't take long to recover. The truth is that the compressor is better built than others and holds the air pressure even after weeks of setting unused. The brad gun is light and easy to use and easy to load...
1,broken compressor no help to fix it,Hi T.W.IT M.C.Ibought this compressor combo kit at a local dealer and when it broke no wants to touch it or have any parts for it.How can I repair my tools!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Disappointing,"I purchased this after viewing The Best of Cheaters, Vol. 1: Uncensored A lot of the episodes on this one were on Volume 1.There really wasn't anything that hot, except a little cursing. It also seemed to be a little shorter than the advertised running time. There were a few episodes on here that I hadn't seen, and being Cheaters, it was still entertaining. However, for the price I paid it was a disappointment. I would skip this one, but I highly recommend Vol. 1"
1,do not purchase this video,"These DVD's are horrible could have been on regular television, the only thing that makes it to hot for tv is the curse words I wasted 35 dollars but since Alpharetta Ga does not have any stores that sell porn or soft porn this is what I had to do. Please do not give your money to this dvd"
4,Gives a good overview of each House,This book gives a good overview of each of the Houses. The only two issues I have are 1) it would be nice to have some explanation of what the blue and red lines mean on the charts and 2)some of the charts have so much information that it would have been nice for the chart to be spread over two pages vs. consolidating it all on to one page making it hard to read.
3,The Dining Rooms...,"Ah-I wanted to like this album, I really did. The beats on the songs were just way too repetitive. I don't know about you, but I get bored quickly after hearing the same beat over and over. In very special exceptions the beat has to blow me away for me to allow it repeat over and over. Sadly its not in this one. This group really has potential; I will still check out their subsequent releases."
1,Brian Eno's Ali Click?,"The song entitled ""Cosi Ti Amo"" is a blatant rip off of Brian Eno's ""Ali Click"". I can't see how any permission was obtained for this. Not only can you hear the ""Ali Click""'s sampled percussion and bass riff in the background, but the looped frog recording was a dead give away.Ali Click (Eno vs. The Grid REMIXES) / I Fall Up - Limited Edition 8 track EPThere is no mention of Brian Eno at all in this album credits, and in turn I am forwarding a letter to Opal, Warner Bros, and WEA."
4,A special find.,"I first found out about The Dining Rooms when I bought the compilation Hi Fidelity Lounge Vol.3 ('Mr. Dupont' is the first track on the CD). Since I loved that compilation, and 'Mr. Dupont' is one of my favourites in there, I could not but buy TDR's CD 'Numero Deux' when I first saw it in a record store. To date, I 've listened to it many times and I always discover new things in every song. This is an excellent CD, full of ambient and jazzy tunes, which will create a very cinematic atmosphere. The terms 'lounge' and 'chill out' seem too narrow to be used in this case. This CD is a lot more. The two Italian brains behind this, Stefano Ghittoni and Cesare Malfatti, explore minimal forms of what it could be music for films from the late '60s and the early '70s. As a matter of fact, they say that the inspiration for the title of this CD came from director Jan-Luc Goddard. In my book, this is the proudful Italian answer to France's Air."
3,Can it be a more reasonable price?,"For those of you selling, only an idiot would pay $250 for the book. Do you mind dropping the price to a more reasonable rate? I'd buy it - but not for that cost."
5,Stunning book!,A stunning book with dozens of gorgeous portraits. Winterhalter could make anyone look beautiful! I think he painted the loveliest portraits of that era. I had to get a used copy as the new ones werent available or extremely expensive but i highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in European history or Art in general. It is truly a gorgeous book.....
5,Great Sell!,Students LOVE pixy stix and they love the giant ones even more. This is a great sell for a fundraiser. I only bought 50 stix for my last event and they sold out in the first 20 min. I plan to buy many more in the future.
2,photo is deceiving,"So you think that your mouse will fit somewhere next to your keyboard and the CPU has it's own space off to the side? guess again! It is very compact (not many are) the instructions for assembly are so limited it's pitiful and now that I have the thing put together, I have no place for the mouse and my CPU is on the floor! Not worth $190, believe me!"
5,read it - you won't regret it,"John Husar's writings don't only apply to fishermen, hunters, or any denomination of people, but to anyone who loves to experience travels, adventures, or living in general, because he wrote not just about the outdoors, but how extraordinary life is. This book is a must-have for anyone who likes good stories told by an exellent storyteller. And who knows, you might learn somthing. Read it, you won't regret it"
3,The Louisiana Rendition of The Little Red Hen,"Candace Fleming takes the well-known story of ""The Little Red Hen"" and adds a southern twist by setting it in the Louisiana bayou and replacing the characters with swamp dwelling animals. French/Louisiana influence is apparent in the characters' names along with choice of cuisine - ""gumbo."" The theme of working hard to earn an end result is slightly skewed in this story with a suprise ending involving the predator. While we, as teachers, were able to connect this story to a familiar favorite, we felt that young children would need some background information on Louisiana in order to enjoy the book and fully understand the characters. This book is a cute but quirky read."
3,Nice illustrations,"This french speaking gator is old and cannot catch his meals any longer. He is teased by the other ""critters"". He decides to trick them by offering them a taster of the gumbo he finally makes. They fall in and the gator finally gets his stew. Very similiar to the Little Red Hen story only it has a HOT twist.The only problem is that the language is difficult for some early readers."
5,oh yeah!,"this is actually a ""greatest hits"" type album, though not promoted that way. these tracks come from 4 earlier releases (pre-tuff enuff and wrap it up). the jimmy vaughn/kim wilson combination, on guitar and harmonica, provide the heat for those texas blues and jump sound. a steady bass and drums provide the hopping back beat. there is one track that is previously unreleased and a few live tracks tossed in. this is a good disc to have if you want some of the older fabulous thunderbird music but don't want to invest in all the discs (although they are worth it). as an earlier review said, it is a great party disc, so dig the groove!"
5,Line6 TonePort UX2,"UX2 is a really great device for everyone who plays the guitar at home. It imitates lots of guitar amps, cabs and effect so that you can enjoy a wide variety of sound."
1,Sudden malfunction,"I really wanted to give this product 4+ stars. Unfortunately that is just impossible with its major drawbacks. As previously mentioned, the software included is horrendous. I had my Toneport UX2 for a full year, purchased it last Christmas. It worked excellently, providing no hassle other than the terrible software. However on December 27th, 2008, a year and 2 days after i bought it, it decided not work. When i plug it in it is not detected, and neither of the two gauges light up. I tried all of the recommended 'solutions' as stated by the Line 6 website. Nothing worked and now im left with a big black and red paper weight. Dealing with the software was manageable due to the well performance of the product, however since it just randomly decided not to work at all, this product cannot be rated any higher than a single star."
5,Amazing,"The illustrations in this book are amazing. Very life like and the bodies on the girls are incredible. If you like ""thick"" women then this book is for you"
2,"Not ""feeling"" it","My son is learning how to use the potty so I thought the ""feel"" part would help the ""learn"" part of the potty training. Not so. I was greatly disappointed. He didn't ever notice that he was wet after using them for more than 6 weeks. I only noticed he was wet after the training pants started to leak. They are not diapers and don't hold much at all so you need to change them constantly or they will leak all over the place. About the only good thing with these is the fact that they pull-up like underwear. I wouldn't use these for toilet training a beginner, perhaps an older child who already has the hang of it. I've switched to 7th Generation since their pull-up pants hold a lot more."
5,Good Companion For Lonely Days,"This book made me feel so much better... I have been wondering how I will get through my days and I felt so sad, but this book made me feel less alone and like everything I was going through was normal. It has lots of great suggestions for things to do instead of obsess over him. I feel like it really sped up my healing process. This book is creative and fun and awesome!"
5,AWESOME!,what a great comfort to remind yourself how much better off you are without some loser. this book rocks!!
5,"Cute, Upbeat Book","This is a cute, upbeat book that encourages women to embrace the grief they feel after a break up and to take care of themselves. It takes a very self-help approach to healing instead of the ""men suck"" strategy. It may not handle the worst types of grief, but it is a quick and refreshing read."
2,not good for guys,"i'm not sure what i was thinking when i bought this. i was suffering from a bad breakup with my girlfriend and had just started looking at ""breakup books."" well, the pink cover should have told me this wasn't a good buy for guys!! it's written by two best girl friends, and it is estrogen-packed... i did find a bit of helpful advice in there, but most of it is of the fluffy, ""eat a lot of ice cream"" variety. well, my breakup isn't fun and fluffy, it's dark, depressing and horrible. i could be wrong, but i suggest if a book as light-hearted as this can get you through your breakup, your relationship wasn't that serious anyway. i'm going to read ""how to heal a broken heart in 30 days."" it looks like a great book and more in-depth than this."
1,Fluff.,"It is more the type of book a 17 year old would give to her friend after the Captain of the Football team left her for a college girl. There was no substance on how one goes on in life after being in a partnership for years to going solo. If you need help during a break up check out anything bu Albert Ellis, or Rebuilding: When your Relationship Ends...or listen to Liz Phair's Exile in Guyville, over and over and over again. Empowering."
1,derivative drivel,"If you want to hear south american music, why listen to a frenchman? worse,this album contains substantial portions of music ""borrowed"" (no attribution) from an excellent Central/North american group, Huyalcaltia.very dissapointing."
5,"simple, soothing visuals and music","My 1 and 2 yr. olds loved this DVD. It's soothing with enticing visuals following certain, softly spoken themes, such as ""look down"" (leaves, grass, etc.)... If your kids only like high charged wiggles, or Sponge Bob, then this may not hold them. But my kids enjoyed it with having it get them totally zoned out as videos often do. It's makes a great background for other activities."
4,happy customer,"I like the look and the colors of this wagon. I think that it is nice. However, think that it is hard to pull. It would work better for me if you could push it instead of pulling. The concept of it very nice for lager children."
5,Talk of the Town,"My Husband and I bought this Vehicle over a 3 years ago for our twins who are now 5. Since that time, we have added a third child (2 years old). They all love it. Everytime we go somewhere we get asked about it. Yesterday we had 5 people ask about it and today at the zoo, it was more popular then the animals. It can be a bit tough to pull, but no harder then regular wagons. Believe me, my son is 50 plus pounds and my daughter is 30lbs, not even factoring the little guy in. If I can pull them up and down hills...anyone can. Worth the investment for us, especially since it folds up nice and compact. Worth every cent for us!!"
3,Wa-diddy,"Incredible that ""feel the music"", ""happy ever after"", and ""carry on"" could be left off this cd. Then they want to charge top dollar for it?! As someone else mentioned, it would make more sense to just release two seperate albums. But that makes too much sense, I guess."
5,The biography of a truly vibrant women,"Goodbye God, We're Going to Texas: A Search for Health and Happiness is the biography of a truly vibrant women, whose life spanned a successful career, dedication to her Christian religion, survival in the lean years of the Great Depression, activism in her community, and more. Though she never married, family was quintessential to her, as were neighbors and friends. Alzheimer's disease marked the final chapter of life, but that far from defines the whole of her contribution. Her biography is unique in that each chapter also makes note of a different health care issue, from the specter of tuberculosis that loomed over her early years to her work in physical therapy. Highly recommended."
2,Does not fit properly in Xbox V1,"I cannot confirm whether or not it fits securely in later xbox versions, but it does not fit properly in V1. You have to really force it in, which I don't really like. It does work however, you can just tell it is poorly designed. Also, probably due to the poor fit, the screen occasionally flickers and behaves oddly at times. The quality isn't that great either. I definitely do not recommend buying this."
5,Works great - 720p!,"I have this cable connected between my xbox (running XBMC) and my 52"" Sony LCD.While it can put out 720p fine the Xbox doesn't have the processing power to do so very well so I run it at 480p, which still looks fantastic."
5,"HD Gaming, Here I Come!","Now, that I have this, I can play all of my Xbox games in progressive scan and HD for the games that offer it. Just plug and play."
3,Does not fit XBox 360 with Kinect,I purchased this cable for my new Xbox 360 with Kinect and it does not fit. The part that goes into my Xbox is too small. I am not giving the product a bad rating because I think that the fault was mine for not doing proper research before buying but I wanted to warn others who might make the same mistake.Since I was unable to connect it I have no comment on the quality or function but shipping was quick and I did get the product I ordered.
4,Good buy !! Great customer service !!!,"The first cable I received was defective, the picture was black and white and flickering and the audio was also off and on. I contacted the seller and received a replacement cable in a timely manner. ..The replacement cable works perfectly well.....great HD quality picture and excellent audio !!! Great customer service !!!"
5,satisfied!,"I looked online for rare Xbox component cables and came across these, and this company sent the product rediculously fast!"
5,Yummy Yummy Yummy for your skin,My friend gave me the vanilla orange scrub as a birthday gift and it's absolutely YUMMY! My skin has never felt this great! It's one of THE BEST scrubs out there. I'm addicted and my husband loves the smell.
2,"Product Great, The Seller Is Poor","I ordered this product through Amazon from AmericanRX as a birthday gift for a friend believing I had plenty of time to recieve it. Nearly everything I order through Amazon arrives in 3 to 5 business days, even when I use normal shipping. This item was received about three weeks from the time I ordered it, way longer than I believe anything purchased online that is supposedly in stock should take. I understand that sometimes problems arise with shipping and inventories. However, I recieved no contact from this seller letting me know this shipment would be delayed. The product itself is actually very nice. In todays environment of online marketing, this sort of delivery performance is not excusable."
5,Lime...definately not a lemon,"My God...I was dancing to Lime back in the crazy 80s. The brother and sister team definately helped to shape what is now High Energy ""Club"". (Club?...come on now, call it what it is...DISCO!) (Why is everyone so afraid of that word?) Anyway, This album represents the best of one of the greatest groups to ever fill a dance floor. I highly recommend it for anyone who has ears!"
4,Take me back to the disco boys...,"If you were old enough to at least sneek into night clubs in the very early 80's, Lime's music way playing!Put this CD in and crank it up!! I have original 12"" versions of most of this music, and the first album as well...it's nice having it now on CD.Enjoy all you disco divas!!"
4,"Gin, Tonic and a Twist of Lime","I remember dancing to these songs in the 80's. I really love (almost) ever song on this CD. I've played it through three times already and can't wait to start it again! I can do without ""Take It Up"", ""Gold Digger"" and ""A Man and A Woman"", but they're not horrible. I do wish ""On the Grid"" was on this CD. This sound quality is flawless. If you're looking to bring back the memories of the 80's, buy this CD, you will NOT regret it! :-)"
4,"Before LimeWire, there was Lime","Infectious, disco grooves that are up, up, up. This is a fabulous greatest-hits collection, (albeit slightly auraly tweaked for the Ninetees), that shows off the sounds of Lime at their blistering best. And the music transcends time and space; my fondest memory is watching my mother and father dance together to 'Unexpected Lovers' in the living room. If you like one Lime track ('Your Love' for example), the rest is just as good.Brad"
4,Too expensive for me,"An excellent album, but too pricey for my budget (it depends, there are many albums out there I have already purchased or would like to buy). If it were for a bit less at the time, I would probably have purchased it. Know nothing on the artist (other than Italo Disco and were quite popular or well-known), but this album is probably one of their best for upbeat enthusiasts (e.g. high-energy style and rhythm).I would recommend this album if you don't mind the high price tag by most sellers (probably due to import or obscurity). If you find one for a low price, grab one while you can! (I have done that twice.)Rated 4/5 for price but excellent music to dance or jog to at any time.Hope this is helpful. All of the above are IMO or just common sense."
2,Uninteresting,Listening to someone talk about their awakening is difficult to digest. When His Holiness the Dalai Lama says I am just a simple monk it made this essaysound so egotistical (though that is addresses). Plus it's supremely dull I would rather a straight autobiography
4,Almost better than the first one,"The two major stands out, to me, from this album are I've Got Plenty of Nothing, and Where's That Rainbow. Barbra's version of the former song spoils any other version, even the ones from Porgy and Bess. It is Babs at one of her more soulful moments. Altogether, this album has some great gems and standards that never surfaced on the actual special"
3,bostich 16 gauge finish nailer,"I received the combo kit for Christmas. Couldn't wait to use it, however, to my dismay the instructions were terrible. As a novice I could not understand how to use the product. I went to my local home improvement store they showed me how to load the nailer and now I am having to visit with them again on how to use the air compressor. I thought that the compressor instructions were going to be better, I was wrong. So far, that is my complaint but from what I have read this product is really a good piece of equipment for a diy person."
2,A Terrible Design,"The compressor works fine and can keep up with a gun or two, but the rub is in the design of the thing. It is a small unit, but the tires are almost too small and the handle is very short. These two things make it hard for anyone that is of average height to pull it around. It tips up and drags. It is cumbersome and irritating. If I had it to do over again, I would buy a larger unit with pneumatic tires and better handle."
1,kind-hearted but quackery,"As a parent of a boy with dyslexia, I know that one searches everywhere for help and answers...but this book is way outside the accepted scientific- method -proven aids for dyslexics. Please at best get it from the library before you follow this doctor down his path. His findings are anecdotal and not reproducable. I believe that he means well but he is is way off base. Absolutely don't make this only book you read on this topic"
2,Ok when it works,"The printer works ok when it works. The setup was horrific, very difficult. On top of it, the software and user manuals (both physical and on Brother's website) are pretty bad. After finally getting everything setup, it drops its wireless singal frequently, which means I have to go Menu -> LAN -> WLAN -> Setup WLAN... -> Connect, pretty much every time I want to print. The quality is just ok. Another main drawback is that the thing chews through ink. I recently purchased a Canon laser (black and white) all in one for a similar price of the ink jet. The set up was very easy, it works perfect, and the quality rocks. I recommend Canon."
1,Keep looking!,"I bought this all in one to replace an old HP all in one. I had hoped to have more options and updated photo features. As it turns out, it will not take my photo cards, will not save to the computer, does not provide software with phot transfer capabilities. I could not scan to PDF files for a newsletter I produce. The phone is mediocre and the fas is disappointing.It has used a great amount of in, which it the biggest cost of owning any office printer. All in all, I wish I had purchased the cannon I debated on getting.;("
1,This machine just EATS ink - stay away,"I bought this planning to do a modest amount of printing, as well as a small amount of copying & faxing. I liked the wireless capability. Never used the phone except to fax. After only a month, I needed to replace the ink cartridges, having printed less than 50 pages! I subsequently learned that if you leave it turned on, it routinely and regularly eats its way through your ink supply. After spending about $75 for new cartridges, I decided to use it only for faxing (printing only a confirmation page) - whenever i was not faxing it was turned off. After 6 months, it's running out of ink again!! I'm replacing it and dumping it in the recycle bin. It's strictly a device sold to generate ink sales. Trust me, any positive reviews here were either written by Brother employees, or by people who did not have it long enough to realize they'd been had. The worst piece of computer equipment I've ever bought - lesson learned - nothing from Brother, ever again."
4,WORKS FOR ME!,"Brother MFC-845cw Color Photo Inkjet Flatbed All-in-One with 5.8GHz Cordless HandsetIt took awhile to get it to be friendly, but once we got acquainted I'm quite satisfied with it. The cordless hand phone is a quality piece of equipment. The fax feed system and follow up confirmation of completion is a nice feature. The flatbed scanner did a nice job of printing a photo, altho' I don't use the machine for that particular process often. I don't care for the four ring ""kick on"" for the answering machine, and I wish that I could extend it to a couple of more rings. It's an irritation to have the OGM go on before I can answer the call. All in all, it's a nice looking piece of equipment and worth what I paid for it."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"What a waste of money...The phone sounds terrible. I thought that would be okay since I have another phone in the office but I have had to use it on occasion and no one can hear me. Also, the yellow ink ran out so it just quit....WILL NOT RECEIVE BLACK & WHITE FAXES, WILL NOT MAKE B/W COPIES if out of YELLOW ink. What a pain. Also it is not user friendly at all. I bet a lot of these reviews were written shortly after purchase...bet they won't be so happy in a few months...been there. Looking for a new one now...uugh...hate to waste my money."
4,Brother mfc 845cw,"Good product performance. But Paperport is only compatible for XP not yet Vista, Bummer.Still, I'd buy it. The update for Paperport is not known yet.."
5,nice home office equipment,"i just bought this mfc 2 days ago i love it ,it has everything you need works perfectly faxing copying priting pics is awsome love the network capablity and not to mention the wireless phone set w/answer machine.i bought this to replace an old hp printer and a dust collecting canon scanner i looked @ hp product but i couldn't find any thing w/the same functions at least not for about the same price the closest thing from hp was about $150 more i bought mine @ office depot about the same price @amazon but office depot offer a mail in rebate (hopefully i'll get it)the only part about this that kindda bugged me was set up w/wireless network & 3 pc'sit just took a while really the main issue was my router not the mfc.if you are looking for a all in one printer you can not go wrong with this one not to mention ink is cheaper than hp's.i give brother 5 shiny stars."
2,Oh brother!!!,"I thought I would give Brother a try since the reviews I saw were mostly positive. I liked the idea of being able to do faxing from the pc without having to print it first. The sending of a fax worked OK. Recieving a fax was not. It seemed to be a software issue that I couldn't get resolved even after hours of installing and reinstalling. Called Brother and talked to India, I answered all their questions and they answered none of mine!Sent it back...thanks Amazon...you give EXCELLENT service!"
1,Paper Jam--Ruined the whole system--threw it away,"This all-in-one device worked fine for about 90 days but then it jammed on a single piece of paper--and the whole system broke down. For some reason, the paper jam made the printing gears jam and they never worked again for printing, faxing, or anything--I had to throw it away after 91 days. May I suggest an Epson."
2,Kinda good... I expected more...,"Perry's account seems to be a bit boring at times. I expected more graphics, more real situations in a regatta, sometimes it looks like a novel. I've skipped lots of pages since he talks nonsense at times. I wouldn't buy againg if I had to. I've only learned 3/4 new things...."
4,A good collection,"Unlike the huge names, collections by Allen are not many - plenty of his opera performances are recorded, but there are only a few collections. My voice teacher recommended I listen to him to understand better how to deliver power without weight, something we've been working on. Yes, it's all in English, but that's fine, and the quality of Allen's instrument comes through very well."
5,great operatic arias---sir thomas allen,Sir Thomas Allen---one of the most superb voices of this and any era.The selections on this disc are well chosen to show this fine voice to good effect across a variety of vocal items. An excellent recording.
1,Disappointing,"I can not trust any book about fashion that has ZERO color photographs of clothes. Other reviewers say that it has some good information, but I did not want to read through it to find out. We all know what a purse looks like, pants, shirts, etc., but I think that the lack of pictures would make it difficult for people to be inspired by only what the author says. I certainly would find it difficult, and I love fashion!There are many newly published books out there that are much better (and have color photographs). Lucky's Guide to Shopping, Vintage Wear, and the Chic Simple Books are all good examples of guides to clothes."
3,Ready to Wear...needs more detail,this is a pretty good book but it would be helpful if it had more pictures of outfits that one could put together
5,Great Wardrobe Guidance,"Mary Lou Andre knows what she is talking about when she gives down-to-earth advice on organizing your closet and building a good basic professional wardrobe. Her recommendation to first go ""shopping"" in your own closet so that you can focus on what you really need to buy to make everything work is excellent. Following her advice in this book will help you avoid impulse buying and style mistakes."
3,Has some good ideas but,"I was a little disappointed. Seems to be geared toward women with a lot more clothes than I even want to own. For example, she mentions she has 14 different pairs of black pants. I also didn't think she handled knowing what looked good on you very well. For example, when she talked about necklines, she referred to about 6 styles and described them, but none were anything I basically intend to wear (all a variation of turtleneck). I know what looked good on me when I was 20, but as I get older (but not old), I need a little help to strike a balance between downright foolish and frumpy. She did have some good ideas about getting organized to make what you have more accessible and useful and it is an interesting book, just not quite what I expected."
5,Freddie Shall Be Our New God!,Freddie is the God of the British Invasion. He was a musical Genius and a wonderful performer that took America by storm in an orgy of light hearted and semi-geeky songs. He truly was a great man and deserves more recognition. I strongly urge all good citizens to listen to his music and sport this man. His songs will lead the into a new golden age of music if he makes a comeback...
1,The WORST of the British Invasion,"When Dean Martin made fun of the Rolling Stones during their appearance on his TV show in 1964, it was only because he was lumping all the British Invasion bands together. He only saw stereotypes. Freddie & the Dreamers WAS that stereotype. Can't think of a worst British Invasion band than this, they make Herman's Hermits sound good. At least their 15 minutes of fame in 1965 ended swiftly. ""Do the Freddie"" indeed!"
2,Creative Zen doesn't charge from the USB port,"Plain and simple, this might be great for many mini USB chargable items, but most Zen models never charged this way! they had a different input just for charging. they were not able to pull power from the USB port even during a file uploads. so that fact they are selling it as such is almost funny."
5,memories child back,"This is a great action figure of mazinger z is 8 1/4 inch tall coming in the box with a jet scrander, a separetes hands, cut steel,a pedetal. a intruction in japanese only actualy everything is in japenese.the mazinger itself is move articulation, include the pilder is removable.in conclusion the whole kit of mazinger-z is a enjoyment pleasure for kids of for ornament in your bookshelf for your looking pleasure.mazinger-z rocks...."
1,Not good,"The ploe does not screw into the bottom base so when my kitty tries to play with it, it falls over"
2,My cats don't like it.,"There is evidently not enough cat nip in this, because most of my cats won't use it. The post itself should be a couple of inches taller, in my opinion. Otherwise the cats can't really stretch up to claw on it. The top doesn't swivel well if the nut is tight. One of my cats does play with the mice hanging down, but she really prefers her catnip toys. The other 3 cats won't touch it. Definitely a waste of money."
4,Wham bam,"GLAM is not so much a book as it is an outline for a book. Still, it is a useful outline, providing a Cliff-Notes history of the Glam music in the early 1970's. GLAM does a good job of listing key Glam albums, chronicling significant events in the period, and describing the basic act of every major and most of the minor Glam acts. What's missing are deeper stories about the personalities of Glam, a serious treatment of the music (surely some of the music deserves serious treatment), or anything other than a superficial sociological explanation of what was going on. Yet this is not meant as a complaint. GLAM serves its purpose, is enjoyable to read, and functions as a really good outline. Now if only someone writes the real book. In the meantime, wham bam, thank you GLAM."
2,I was a bit disappointed.,"Although I lived and experienced the Glam Rock era in the UK back in the early 70s, reading this book did little to rekindle my memories of that period. There is much emphasis placed on who influenced who and when and how. For me, it was written in a somewhat stale manner."
4,He's not such a bad martial artist after all.,"Anthony ""Amp"" Elmore is a hero and a genius. This autobiographical-action-comedy-drama, directed by and starring Elmore, tells the true story of how a little kid with a big afro used the teachings of Shotokan (old Japanese style Karate) to rise from his meager roots and become a man... a man who is one of the great superpowers of kickboxing! While traveling on this life journey, ""Amp"" made many allies, and we meet a few of them in this film: Sensai, Mike Patton, The Ring Girls... but the one who stands out the most is the one, the only... Kingfish! Kingfish's antics will keep you laughing while Elmore's kicking will keep you screaming for more. Truly inspiring."
5,Great Cleats,"These cleats are great. I coach for a highschool football team and I bought the cleats for demonstrating purposes, doing drills, and the like so I wouldn't fall down while executing them at full speed. These cleats grip great. Also it is the first time wearing new cleats where I didn't get any blisters. since buying these cleats my friends and I go out and play every sunday evening, 5 on 5 touch football, and these cleats are far superior to any I have ever gotten. also the pump feature really gives the ankel good support. thanks reebok for making a superior cleat, and thanks Amazon for getting me a great deal.Jim K."
2,What production were you guys watching?!,"Based on the other reviews here, I purchased this but was very disappointed. Suor Angelica is my favorite of these three, and it was OK (not great), but Rosalind Plowright is NOT the ideal Angelica: VERY short on top (sounds like a mezzo, and Angelica needs a solid C) and one dynamic - LOUD.Gianni Schicchi was just embarassing. None of the singers were good (the young tenor was OK but, again, just LOUD all the time) and the acting was execrable. I've done this show a couple of times myself, so know where the humor should be, etc., and there was just. . .NOTHING. You'd think with Italian singers (this was recorded at La Scala, by the way) singing in Italian, the humor would come through loud and clear, but they might as well have been singing Swahili (and not understanding a word of it!).A clear disppointment to me - I'm glad to finally have a video of Trittico, but it could have been SO much better."
2,Ditto JWALKER - What were you guys watching?,I agree almost completely with JWALKER019. This ugle 1983 production looks like it was from the 1950's and Gianni S. is downright embarrassing. The costuming there makes everyone look absurd. Tabarro has little passion most of the time but the singing is good. Angelica is okay but it is not a part for Plowright and I definitely did not like Dunja Vejzovic as the Princess. It is great to have this opera on DVD but otherwise it was a big disappointment. No goosebumps here. I just finished watching my old tape from 1981 of the Met broadcast with Scotto in all three of the 1 acters. What a delight -- some weak points here and there but it has passion in spades and that's what these need. Scotto was incredible in Suor Angelica. We should be so lucky to have these performances released on DVD but that is highly unlikely. I've given this La Scala DVD 2 stars but that is probably being generous.
3,Garage-punk compilation,"It's a good compilation of garage-punk bands from some USA states.It's good, but not like Pebbles or Nuggets.Recommended just to who's interested to collect every garage-punk band from the sixties."
3,Ok book but....,"This book is ok. Being an art history buff, I did learn some facts I didn't know before. But to call this ""100 Artists Who Shaped World History"" is a real stretch of the imagination. A better title would be ""100 Influential Artists"". Also, some of the artists included seemed to be filler, just to reach the 100. Plus, I was disappointed on some artist left out, such as Christo and Sisquieros."
2,An outmoded book for late teens,"I bought this by mistake, I thought it would be about the spice route, it is not. There is something wrong with the style, I had to quit on page three. I am sorry about this, love to write good reviews."
4,"GOOD ITEM, HEAVY AND DURABLE","This item is heavy and it shows on the shipping cost.The case is average and with heavy use it feels that the handle will give up easily.The chips are heavy and feel great and sound great.The images on the chips look cartoonish, and are a good feature when you play with people that want to know the value of the chips.Buy an extra set of cards, because the ones inside are paper and tend to bend real easy.The combination of weight and sound makes your home playing an almost real experience."
2,The controls stink!,I totally agree with the previous reviewer. I hate the controls on this game. I've tried the keyboard and mouse and both impede enjoyment of the game. They need to rework this function!
2,Can I sell it On Ebay!!!!,"Contrary to other reviwes posted I will tell you that the Evening Primrose on the Mandy Patinkin Cd ""Dress Casual"" IS the ""Primrose"" to own. This one was in my opinion under acted and undersung. While Mandy Patinkin is always over the tip, Ms Peters is one of the best Interpreters of Sondheim's works and the orchestration on this is much darker and deep, like the subject matter of the piece. I found this whole CD lacking, given that just like the ""Dress Casual"" I bought it only for the ""Evening Primrose"" selections. Thank the GODS for CD Burners so I can compile my own best of Sondheim CD."
5,Salt On Our Skin,"If you're a D'Onofrio fan, you'll really want to own this one. It's a story of passion that seems to ever have the one lover out of step with the other. So many opportunities are given in this film for us to whisper, ""I wouldn't do that!"" But, ""they"" do and you get to go along for the ride.You will see little exchanges that are ever so human between the lovers that eventually, you'll be doing something similiar and be reminded of the film. It'll haunt you like that.There's passion...there's foolishness...there's love and understanding - what's not to like? It's humanity in all it's glory and nonsense! I'd highly recommend this movie as an afternoon get away!"
2,Yikes,"An interesting way to review the careers of Scacchi and D'Onofrio, but otherwise, it's a no go. Long term adultery is not a sympathetic love story. It's hard to empathize with Georges (Scacchi), a woman who doesn't want to be the wife of a fisherman, but wants to bang him annually, for old time's sake. Gavin (D'Onofrio) portrays the traditionally female role of the seduced partner who then feels awfully, awfully bad about betraying the spouse. They are supposed to age from late teens to late middle age, but mostly D'Onofrio grows more and more and more facial hair. One becomes frightened of how he will appear at their next assignation. Of the two, he is nevertheless more convincing in the aging process, and in his final scene the beard is at last under control and practically believable. D'Onofrio looks very fine in his introductory scene, and Scacchi is lovely, but the story is unconvincing, overwrought and overlong."
4,Worth buying,Worth buying if you are a Vincent D'Onofrio fan - he makes the film and shines with his portrayal as Gavin. I was disapointed by the ending though - I would have loved to see more about the character's illness.
4,Mike Hammer is Back,"THE KILLING MAN by Mickey Spillane marks the return of Mike Hammer, one of the most viral of the detective genre.Mike walks into his office to discover his beloved secretary, Velda, unconscious, the brutal murder of ex-mobster Anthony DiCica at Mike's desk, and a note from the killer signed Penta.Mike is in the middle and taking hits from the DA's office, the FBI, the CIA, and the mob, while being assumed to have been the intended victim when DiCica was murdered.For none stop action with a satisfying conclusion from an author that delivers a good yarn nothing can be better than a Mickey Spillane.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS and QUALIFYING LAPS."
5,The Killing man,Got the book in great time. IT was in great shape. I would recommend anyone to buy from these people. I know I will again.
3,Average Hammer.,"I'm not sure if this book was written before or after Spillane became a Jehovah's Witness, but this book seems a bit toned down. Violence is still here, but the sex is all but gone. This book is pretty good though. There were various bits I liked about this book. Very hard-boiled. The mystery is still intriguing, but it's the cheap way that our detective solves the mystery in the last chapter that flaws this book."
3,Average,The first and only (so far) that I've read from this author. To be honest I found it a little boring and predictable. It was ok to pass time by the pool his summer.
4,Spectacularly intelligent show,"The cast recording of Tick, Tick... Boom! is absolutely a standout. With the current status of Broadway shows, you would be hard pressed to find another show with as much wit, heart, intelligence, and talent as this one. Overshadowed by it's brash brother ""The Producers"", Tick, Tick... Boom! doesn't hit you over the head with humor. It's an experience more reminiscent of a long talk with your funniest but most angst-ridden friend. The recording is lovely and well performed and does as much justice to the show as is possible on a CD. Like Rent, this is a rock-inspired musical with tributes to pop culture, Stephen Sondheim, and the importance of doing what is most important to you. But even more than Rent, this show will remind you of how talented Jonathon Larson really was-- and make you wish he was still around to compose."
5,Incredible,"I bought this CD because I needed some inspiration. I love Jonathan's music in Rent, I love the composition, the lyrics, the ""score"" of the entire show. It excited me to remember that another piece of Jonathan's creation was being published. Inspiration I found. ""Louder than Words"" cannot be any better, especially right now. The harmonies and vocals on this song are gorgeous, the instrumentals are amazing, the lyrics are beautiful and the song as a whole is inspiration. This song is not the only standout, however. ""30/90"" is a great, catchy song that proved to me I would love this recording after one minute. ""Therapy"" is a cute showtune and ""No More"" sounds like it comes straight from RENT. Raul Esparza has the perfect voice for these songs, and Amy Spanger sounds beautiful. I think I am in love with this."
5,Stop Paying RENT and buy THIS!,"Now dont get me wrong, I love me some RENT, but this musical is amazing. This is my all time favorite musical, and it should be on broadway. The lyrics, as in rent, are phenominal, but the music is even better. And the songs all get stuck in your head, and you'll sing them for days. And another great thing, everyone should be able to identify with some point in the show, as it goes through dealing with growing up, and I think we've all been there. So, collector, or first time buyer, this is a must have. Favorite Song: ""Actions Speak Louder Than Words"""
5,Better than RENT!!!!!,I went to tick tick boom!! on a whim and fell in love with it. It was very amazing and Jonathan had a wonderful future ahead of him - so sad that it ended so unexpectedly.
4,Thrilled,"I just received this rollator. I must say I was shocked at the size of the box but quickly realized it was mostly assembled. I was happy about that. The wheels are large so I don't have to worry about using it outside, which I will do as soon as the weather changes. I love the seat the most, its comfortable and feels really stable. Folding it is a little awkward but being able to go on outings and actually enjoy them is worth far more to me and my family. My only concern is the size of the rollator in relation to doors and aisle in stores. Some stores I will not be able to go to due to the large size but most major stores should have wide enough openings. All in all its fabulous."
5,Bob Vath's Rollator Review,My wife is a big woman with alot of ambition but limited capacity. She says the chair (rollator) is comfortable to sit on ... she has an instant chair wherever she goes now and it is easier to use than the walker she had previously. She can get out of the house alot more now!She loves her Rollator.She recently saw a similar device that was priced alot higher ... I get very few favorable commentslike that.
4,Mr.,The product was exactly what I was looking for. Amazon did a great job in supplying the product quickly.
5,Very good product.,"It is as advertised and works very well, helps me to walk. It folds up somewhat and is not heavy. I will use it for years to come."
1,Perfectly dreadful!,"I wish I would have paid attention to the previous review and saved myself the heartache of purchasing this turkey. These are NOT the original ""Dot"" recordings fromt he 50's, these are hideously pale remakes. Pat warbles these classics in a shaky voice, sounding like he had just been injected with morphine. For comic value, I'd give this album five stars, but I wanted to listen to the original Boone recordings, not these atrocious remakes. Avoid this pabulum like arsenic!"
5,On target again,"As per usual, Mr. Leamer produces an excellent volume of research on one of America's best known families. He is fair and empathetic.For myself ,speaking as one who has read many of his other books,Mr.Leamer is trustworthy with regard to his research sources."
5,Home Run,"I have read most books about the Kennedys, and I'venever read anything with such an intimate sense of their lives. I can understand why all the Kennedys cooperated with Leamer, because he tells the truth but he tells it in an empathetic way. I ended up caring more for these sons of Camelot and what they have gone through. I'll never forget this book. I wish I could give it ten stars."
4,Finally a book for my generation,"I have always only been marginally interested in the older Kennedys, but must admit (like many of you out there)to a secret passion for John Jr. I found this book a fascinating read--it gave me increased insight into the psychology of John and his family members and introduced me to the achievements of Kennedys I had never even heard about. It does not sensationalize, but rather tries to respectfully and deeply understand."
1,Spreading lies about JFK Jr. and his wife using anonymous so,"Spreading lies about JFK Jr. and his wife using anonymous sources.People that think that this was for selling better are in denial.The reason is much more sinister. For some reason the goal of the book is to cover-up the circumstances of his death.The other reason is to diffamate his memory. Does November 2, 2004 ring a bell ?"
3,Had Potential.....,"This is a film that had the potential to be very good, but was obviously very rushed, production-wise. You have to kinda cut first- time filmakers some slack; they learn and get better as time goes on, trial and error. The acting wasn't bad, the overall story was good. The cinemetography is where things go bad, but, you gotta start somewhere. It'll be interesting to see what the director's next project will be."
1,One word: Awful.,"I bought this movie believing that it had some potential, but unfortunately, it didn't. It was awful. I felt as though I were watching a bootleg tape. Please don't waste your time on this one."
2,IM THE DIRECTOR OF THIS FILM,"I am the director of this mess. I just wanted to say, in my defense that I had no budget, and I had a hard time trying to make this film, because 5 days into production, Fazion Love walk off the set and, went back to L.A. to shoot a movie called The Replacement Killers. This movie could have been a good little low budget classic. So the script and movie in additon to not having enough money, was a huge factor. But the other problem was that, I really was focus on having sex with the extras, instead of taking my craft a little more seriously. I took a break from making low buget films, after this mess. I have been learning the craft of filmmaking. I have been directing music videos, etc. As of today I am gearing up to shoot my first feature, that is in the millions. So I guess somebody thinks that I have an eye for filmmaking. See you guys at the Oscars!!"
3,A Sad Surprise,"""The song ""Hello"" from the album Ballads and Blues does not appear on this CD due to time restrictions."" This is the info I got on the CD AFTER I bought it. Any fan of Bags will be sorely disappointed that the beautiful duet with Lucky Thompson and Milt is absent. Luckily for me I have the original album, which, of course, I have downloaded to CD."
3,CRACKED CASE,"The product didn't match the description. The case was cracked, it had obviously been ""used."" It wouldhave been passed over had I seen it at a garage sale."
1,Bad Dictionary,I bought this book as a gift for someone who wanted to learn the language. What a mistake. This dictionary is far to simplistic and does not provide examples or sentences that shows how to use the word. I read some of the tagalog definitions for english words and some were far too vague. This is not a very good book for someone who is looking to learn the language.
2,Don't waste your money!,"This book reads like it was written by a 12 year old. I only needed to read the first chapter and decided to return it. It is filled with incorrect information and incorrect test answers.The security suggestions are rediculous, and not really useful or manageable in a business environment (One Time Passwords, VPN to the Desktop).Don't waste your money on this book."
5,"Amazing, Beautiful Spirits","I enjoyed this book very much! Being an owner of two of my own wolf-dogs, I could identify with this author and his wife. It is an amazing & unforgetable journey. Many trials, but it is all worth it! Animals are such wonderful teachers, as Lobo was. For you, Lobo, thank you."
2,Look elsewhere,"This bowl didn't survive two months of use with a single ferret.The design is silly to begin with -- there are screw on holders to attach it to the cage which don't connect directly to the bowl. There are little notches you have to then connect the bowl to which is surprisingly difficult. I had a system down after way too steep of a learning curve for a food dish... then I broke my leg. NO one that came to help me feed my pet could figure out how to do this even with my instruction.Then one of the ""notches"" in the dish broke and a week later the second one broke. Now I have to buy another dish but I will be avoiding this one.The only good thing is that it's a corner dish which saves room in the cage but it's not durable and ridiculous to put in. The little grip it has is also very flimsy even when installed correctly and my baby ferret was easily able to knock it down and over if he started playing with it."
1,Hanging knobs break easy!!,"It's a great fit for the corner of my bunnies cage, BUT is not very durable at all! The little knobs on the hanging attachments wear and break off very easily, and all my bunnie does is rest her paws sometimes on the front while eating. I wish they sold replacement parts, or better yet made the attaching parts out of metal so they would'nt break off. Once the dish is down it's useless since it tips over easily, the only way to fix it is to buy a new dish and gauranteed it will do the same. I really like the way it saves space by being a corner feeder, but it's attaching design is the PITS and needs to be improved on!!! I am looking for another dish to replace it with."
4,"Good bowl, wish attachments were more durable","We have two of these. We had to replace the first one we had because one of the attachment pieces broke. As long as you don't over abuse it, like my husband did, these work very well."
1,Bowl not worth the price,This hanging food dish is to cheaply made. It does not stay up within seconds of hanging it in the cage my ferrets had it down. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!!!! DOES NOT WORK AS ADVERTISED!!!!!!!
1,Lasted not even two weeks!,"I bought this bowl to use in my ferrets cage. I needed it to catch water from a slowly leaking water bottle. Not only could my ferret easily take it off its brackets, one of the brackets broke off completely within the first week. A few days later the other bracket broke off too. Now this bowl is useless since its so easily dumped over."
1,Great.. For a week and a half.,"I got this crock just under two weeks ago, and it seemed to be working pretty well. However, when I went to clean my rabbits' cage this morning, one of the connecting pieces that locks into the crock so it hangs on the cage wall had broken off. By the time I returned this evening, the other side had broken as well, and the crock was lying in the litter box. My rabbits are not rough with their things at all, and I am not rough while cleaning. They did tend to rest their front paws on the crock at times while eating, which should not have caused any damage, at least not within two weeks of use.I am going to look for a new crock that seems sturdier, perhaps one with metal attachments."
2,Might work better in another cage,I bought this thinking it would be perfect for my ferret and work well with my Ferret Nation cage. I was sadly mistaken. The little points of attachment seem to be suited better for a horizontal wire cage (Which the Ferret Nation cage is NOT)but it came with plastic brackets that are suppose to make the bowl work with vertical wire cages but it still didnt work well. It took considerable effort on my part to firmly secure it to the cage. And due to design flaws that are suppose to be convenient to you the ferret was able to loosen the bowl and tip it. Which lead to one of the attachment points breaking off after that the other point broke off 2 days later. In all it lasted 4 days! The bowl itself is a hard solid plastic but unattached it has only proven to provide fun for my ferret by being repeatedly flipped over and food scattered about.
2,Pseudo-science,"When a religion book tries to be a science book, the result is torturous for thinking readers. This book is that. I happen to agree that we have multiple intelligences. Ms. DeBeauport does not pretend that any of them are unnecessary, yet she plays footloose with the rational intelligence when she traipses over logic and integrity. (In this I regard her book as common.) Her deductive reasoning is wonderful to follow in the introduction. To paraphrase, ""I started with research, and I wanted to support my findings, and I found the usual rationalistic paradigm would not render them indisputable. So, I looked to the new physics and a lot of what follows is perceptible along non-rational pathways."" Sounds a lot like medieval deductive reasoning to me--just a different axe to grind. The scholastics would feel right at home with this book."
4,An little known part of African American history,"I discovered this book while on vacation in St. Augustine. We were visiting the fort and the book was on display in the bookstore. Just seeing the cover alone exposed me to a part of African American history that I was never aware of and reading the books was an eye opening experience. I've made several trips to the area since then to broaden my knowledge of this fascinating time in our history, including visiting the site of Fort Mose. This book is a must read for anyone serious about gaining a complete knowledge of the history of Africans in America."
4,Jacobean patterns,"Nice for inspiration! A few variations of filling patterns, nice color photographs, though a bit misleading since the iron-on pages only covers part of the image in the color plate. Stitches show in the pictures so you get an idea of how they and the colors were used.Another good book to have for any one into Jacobean patterns.Anna"
1,The Worst of Marilu's books,I was expecting much better having read her health makeoverbooks and liking her straightforward style. This book is much toopreachy and common sensical. It's a perfect guidebook for those who completely lack common sense.
2,Find Support for Your Spritited Kids Elsewhere,"In hindsight, I should have been wary about this book. Even when my kids are having off days, I don't call them ""Brats."" A lot of the responses to questions asked by people are curt and sometimes, I felt, harsh.Another question I wondered while reading this book is ""If the author is so stable and had such a fabulous family, why did she seek out a shrink to begin with?"" The fact that the shrink has ties to Freud is also a big caution sign to me.If you want a book on how to deal with kids and their crazy days, I recommend Supernanny. Although I never watched any of the Suppernanny shows, I found that book enlightening and helpful and motivational as opposed to the critical and harsh tone of this book.Some of the authors anecdotes were entertaining, but I struggled through the rest of the book."
1,Little more than child abuse!,"This book is shameful. It is little more than child abuse cloaked by celebrity. she sounds like a contemporary ""mommy dearest"" and surely her children will get their literary revenge some day!"
1,A bunch of nonsense!,This book was a waste of time and money. Marilu should stick with acting and leave the book writing to the experts.
1,Not a Helpful Book,"As a parent of three children, I found this book to be obnoxious. What Marilu and Dr. Sharon consider to be ""overindulgence"", in many instances, I call ""nuturing"". They don't take into account that you can be a disciplinarian as well as respecting your children for who they are, even when they are young babies. It would be better to buy a comprehensive book on the different stages a child goes through by age since there is no one ""right"" way that guarantees good behavior in every child. Marilu doesn't have any real qualifications for writing a parenting book other than having two small children of her own. This is not a book to give as a gift to any parent, it is very subjective and could be offensive."
1,I REFUSE TO READ THE REST OF THIS BOOK,"I get the gist of what the authors were trying to convey but the advice became so discombobulated and ridiculous that they missed the target. Just because Marilu is a celebrity who has children does not qualify her to write this type of literature. She tries to gain validity by teaming with a professional who, unfortunately, seems unqualified as well. Their views also seem very ""out-of-touch"" and anti-nurturing. For example: If your child is sick one day, they suggest that you don't stay home with him. You should have your housekeeper stay with him instead.This book mostly out-raged me. On what merits was it even published? Honestly, I couldn't even read the last chapters because it was so poor. Save yourself some time and do your kids a favor and don't read this book."
2,Good concept - rather thin,"This is a pop psychology book written for the ""National Enquirer"" crowd. It is not deep. The treatment is superficial.HOWEVER! The main message is quite valid and there are a lot of moms and dads out there who may be wonderful, well-intentioned human beings and are unaware that permissive childraising can have some serious negative consequences.So if you are unsure if setting limits, enforcing consequences, and making demands on your children are ""right"", read this book.Bottom line: If you don't enforce limits on your children, if you don't clearly spell out your expectations, if you don't ALWAYS follow through with meaningful consequences, you run the risk of raising, not only a brat but in severe cases, a sociopath. At the very least, you'll have 18 years with an unhappy child who makes your life miserable."
3,"Read it for yourself, and use the information you find helpful.","My married daughter read this book first and then loaned it to me to see what I thought about it.I was interested to find all the areas that my daughter had marked with yellow highlighter. Obviously there were many sections that my daughter felt with applicable to what was happening in her life at that time. While there parts of the book that I didn't agree with, such as some of the section on breastfeeding, there was much of value in this book.As parents is it our responsibility to set the rules of the house and teach them to the children. Just as it is important to treat your child with love and tenderness it is also important for that child to learn that the world does not revolve around them and there is certain ways one needs to act in certain situations.It was an easy read, with short sections in each chapter. Don't over analyze the book, read it and take to heart what you feel is important or valuable. I gave it 3 stars."
1,What a sad book...,"I was so distressed by the advice in this book. It reminded me of the 'scientific' way to raise children that was so popular in the 1920's. I am so glad I had parents who cuddled me whenever I needed it, and were at my side when I was sick. Did I grow up to be a brat? I don't think so. Because I was nutured, I grew up to have great empathy for others. I fear that children who are raised by the advice given in this book will grow up to be starved for attention.We have all seen pictures of neglected children in overseas orphanages who rock themselves in their cribs because there is no one to come when they cry...why would we go out of our way in this country to inflict that kind of ""parenting"" on our own children? I think Ms. Henner is a talented actress, but this book's advice really made me sad..."
1,Don't bother with this book...,"Only a Hollywood actress would need or want a psycho-analyst to help her raise her kids! I was offended by almost every chapter in this book. I read the entire book, wanting to give it a chance - but the advice is awful. No one wants to raise a brat - and you do not need an actress or a psycho-analyst to tell you how to avoid raising one. You just use love and common sense! Perhaps the authors should stick to acting and advising actors, and leave parents alone!"
3,OK,"This game could be better. The graphics are amazing, but the game just continues on and on and nothing changes. I wouldn't reccomend this to many people. If you like really hard levels and frogs, this game is for you."
2,its to easy,Frogger 2 is way to easy. I beat it in one day so I don't recommend this game to eny computer whiz like me. The first frogger would be better for people like me.
1,Fogger 2,I liked Fogger 2 but it was a bit easy because I am a computer wize. In my opinion I would get Frogger because it is harder and a lot more fun.
5,A Hopping Success,"20 yrs ago I enjoyed playing the arcade game, Frogger while in college. This game takes me back to the good old days.The graphics are superior and the game is a very enjoyable remake of the classic.While the game is not particularly difficult, it offers true enjoyment, especially for those thirtysomethings who enjoy trying to relieve their stress at the end of the day.One has fun trying to master each of the thirty levels and the various aspects of the game.In short, if you are in for games that offer extreme difficulty this may not be your cup of tea, but if you want a light game, that is an excellent remake of the arcade game and a true step up from Frogger I for the computers, then this is for you."
5,Frogger2 rocks,"First i'd like to say that the editor screwed up the details of this game.It's not the sequal to the Retro Frogger of the 80's,it's the sequal to 1998's 3d Frogger!There is all together 4 real versions,retro 80's,3d Frogger,frogger jr,and frogger2! You can't hardly find Retro Frogger from the 80's or Frogger JR anywhere.Hasbro/Atari remade Frogger in 98 as a 3d revibe.Frogger2 (this version) is the more simplier,high-graphic,part 2 of the remake.I love F rogger and am a Froggerphile :) I own everyone of games except Frogger JR. Even though this game is easy it's very well done,the graphics are great.The music even sticks in your head the more you play and calls you back for more.The only bad things in this sequal is the game is either too easy or too hard!"
3,"Great Graphics, Poor Game","First off, I'm a HUGE Frogger fan but I'm sorry, this justdisappointed me. It was definately not worth the [money] I spent for it. The graphics are awesome and the new jumps/characters/etc are wonderful which is the only reason I gave it 3 stars. I got through the game in one hour. The levels aren't challenging at all and there aren't enough of them. It's a fun game but only if you want to be entertained for a couple hours."
2,Flashy Trash,"A disappointing sequel. The graphics are pretty (if too flashy) and the new characters add some interest, but it's a hollow effort. The game requires none of the skill that Hasbro's first Frogger did. The only challenge here is playing the game against a timer--personally, I'd rather be asked to do something well than to do it fast.One thing I cannot understand here is that the game lacks a save/restore option in Story mode. This would come in handy if you have more than one person in your household playing the game (i.e. more than one child.) The scoring system is also irritating--to obtain the one high-score slot for each level, you must compete with some unknown program tester's high score.Overall the game is entertaining for a few days, but little more."
4,Frog Hoppin' Butterfly Lickin' Good Time!!!,"Not a bad game at all! Fun, and it lasts a while. Doesn't ruin the original. But don't get the ""Frogger Adventures"". Those aren't fun at all. Okay animation. Good music and sound effects. Nice color too. All in all a good game."
3,BUGGY,Frogger one was a big hit. It was a very basic game that caught on. Frogger 2 has some very big advanges to frogger 1. First they have a plot and story line unlike the first one. They have serval difrent frogs to choose from although I do not see that big of an advange to any diffrent frog. The arcade mode has a little advange but not a big one. The bottome line though is this game is a little buggy. For example in the options menu you can not see where your cursor is. It is a sold game with some upgrades needed.
2,Easy,Frogger 2 is way to easy I beat it in less than one day even the last level is to easy but I recommend the first frogger
4,"Decent, but short","This game is pretty darn fun, but unfortunately, too short... Anyone can finish it in 3 hours flat, which doesn't justify its price.The gameplay is great!Overall, a good game, but too short."
3,"Fun, but not as good as the original","The game was fun, but compared to the original it was REALLY dissapointing, my advice is stick with the original period."
5,GREAT CD!,"I don't know who loves this music more - my daughter or me! It's a great CD, and a very refreshing change from the 'kiddie' music and lullabies. I now give it as a baby shower gift!"
2,"Mostly cheesy songs, doesn't put baby to sleep","I was disappointed by this CD. Most of the songs are cheesy, not great lullabyes, and it doesn't help my baby mellow out or get sleepy at all. I regret buying it."
5,You have no option!,If you have small children; if you are a child at heart; if you like Allison Krauss BUY THIS CD. Do it now! Every minute you wait will be seconds ticking off of you life that you could be enjoying this amazing piece of work...
1,Frisell owes me 15 bucks,"I bought this sight unseen in Japan while on the road. ""ooh!"" I said, ""Frisell with Holland and Jones. I'll take one!"" Last time I do that.I've been reading the reviews from pro and con of this record and I side with the con most definitely. This sounds like a jazz album by country musicians. Or a country album by Jazz musicians, take your pick.I'm not a musical snob, I'm a player and lover of Jazz, but this is just boring, directionless, emotionless, mezzo-forte, medium tempo pablum.I feel conned honestly. Elvin and Dave... you've been used.Recommendation... buy Dave Holland's latest solo efforts, they are amazing. Inspired playing with truly progressive compositions. And for Elvin? Well, personally I'd stick to the classic Trane sides..."
1,Save your money,"I happened upon this at a local retailer and figured it was my lucky day. What a MAJOR dissapointment. Why hire ELVIN JONES to play quarter notes on his ride cymbal for an hour ?No cool melodies, definitely nothing even close to chops. This is not mellow, it's plain boring. What a waste of an opportunity."
1,boring stuff,"I love all 3 of these guys.However, this CD just plain stinks.Dave Holland is boring on it.Elvin Jones is boring on it.Bill Frisell is boring on it.And how can any of these three guys ever be boring?I don't know, but that just clarifies how bad and boring this CD is."
1,Frisell with Elvin Holland on Bass and Dave Jones on Drums,"Who are Elvin Holland and Dave Jones you ask? I don't know either, but Bill Frisell might as well have hired them for this date. This CD is plain awful, and should have remained in the can. Virtually none of the personality of Holland and Jones comes through, and Frisell tries to adapt his old tunes to this ensemble but fails miserably. Likely he just played the heads or melodies for Holland and Jones, and said ""Let's play, and see what happens."" Unfortunately, nothing happens. At all. To show how much heart was put into this, just listen to the last track where Elvin keeps playing after the song is done. Either he didn't know how the tune went, or he was just bored to tears playing vamps all day long. Since I was bored to tears, I assume the latter."
1,This is not Jazz!,"(...) No jazz musician would play ""Moon River"" as bland and lacking ANY hamonic creativity as he did on the recording. There is no jazz language in his playing anywhere. If it walks and sounds like a duck, then it is a duck, not a jazz musician. (...)"
2,"No Thanks, I'll pass...","I did the sound bites from this site and that was enough to convince me that I want no part of this CD. I think your editorial review was way off too. Frisell's ""contemplative but minimalist guitar sound"" put a pair of minimalist handcuffs on Elvin Jones. This one is destined to show up on a ""Best Of Windham Hill"" collection. Two stars only because I could have missed something by not hearing the disk in its entirety..."
2,A mistake,"Nothing wrong with the 'supergroup' concept, and this same combination of bass-n-drums works beautifully on Joe Lovano's Trio Fascination Vol. 1. But this group simply does not gel. Holland seems to be spending the entire CD trying to reconcile the antithetical approaches of Frisell and Jones, and fails to do so. The guitarist's style emphasizes the timbral over the rhythmic, which is the main problem; Jones is the ideal accompanist for a player willing to push the rhythmic inflections. Here, the drummer slows down and smooths out his approach so much that, save for the free-floating shimmer of the cymbals, he's unrecognizable as the great Elvin Jones. Frisell flows along sweetly yet blithely, and Holland is left to provide an anchor for which there is no tether. Some pretty moments, but all-in-all a real, and highly disappointing, failure."
4,Good Jammin',"I'm not a big Bill Frisell fan, I haven't listened to much of his music, and I haven't liked much of what I've heard. At ""first listen"" this album (CD) combines great guitar and bass with the best of Grateful Dead-style jamming (without getting too far ""out there""). Short sound bites don't do it justice--you should try to hear it at a listening station somewhere (nameless). The great Elvin Jones is a bit underutilized, but it's still a worthwhile purchase."
3,Not bad!,"This is a change of pace for Frisell fans. Most of the tunes have a ballad feel and I miss the panic stricken scream of his earlier stuff. But if you like pretty songs, this qualifies."
4,No Complaints Here,"Too many are critical of what this session is not. How about accepting that a great musician, such as Elvin Jones, may have enough virtuosity to play in a fashion that is not his norm in order to contribute effectively and beautifully to a group playing very listenable and relaxing music. This doesn't make him any less of a drummer since what he does totally complements what everyone else is doing. This is a very fine and listenable session and should be accepted for what it is, not what some would wish it to be."
2,"Flat, jaded, & uninspired.","I am a huge fan of all 3 players, all of whom have had MANY shining moments, and thought * what a dream team *But, much to my disappointment, this one seems just this side of a snooze fest. Lacking were any standout solos; just reworked (overworked)tunes we all know and admire. Overall, I was left with a grey and flat feeling. I know there are many here who laud much critical acclaim on the disc. I just don't get it, especially knowing how capable these musicians are, both individually and in group settings. I'd love to see another attempt - this time with NEW material, more upbeat tunes, interesting Friz effects, and more compelling phrasing."
4,An excellent display of Frisell's abilities.,"For years, I've been praying that Bill Frisell would make an album that balances the character and sweetness of his americana records with the hard grooving experimentation of records like the excellent ""Unspeakable."" With this outing, it seems Frisell has finally done it. From the very first phrase of Outlaws, a reworking of the tune from Blues Dream, we hear low-tuned acoustic bombast ala Marc Ribot ushering in Frisell's familar quirky electric lines. From there Jones and Holland dive into a groove so simple, yet perfectly atmospheric that Frisell is able to dance between folk, blues, jazz, and experimental guitar sounds with perfect stylistic continuity. In this way, the album lacks a stylistic theme like Frisell's other works, but demonstrates his formidable abilities as an improviser and composer better than almost any other album to date."
3,worked o.k.,i would use this is you have a small amount of moss in your grass.This seemed to work better than the granuals.But nothing beats moss like good drainage and a health lawn.
1,Firesign Sells Out,"Firesign fans, you are in for a shock. This is easily their worst album ever, even worse than that last thing. It starts with several minutes of shockingly stupid penis jokes and goes downhill from there.The only marginally funny part is the short Nick Danger cut, which is still ruined by lame references to old jokes. They sound like Firesign nuts, throwing old one liners to each other.My advice, DON'T buy it. It's bloody AWFUL."
5,Buy This Record Or We'll Shoot This Dog!,"...So here's the deal. Yes, they basically take existing characters and put them in new situations. Yes, the first segment (a satire of the Men's Movement, by the way) was a surprise the first time. And... it all works! It's freakin' hilarious!They obviously knew what they were doing when not creating all brand new characters, and don't be concerned about them reaching a creative dead-end, as opined by some reviewers herein. Remember, Give Me Immortality introduced a whole new set of folks in a format that is extremely flexible (yes, I know Ralph Spoilsport isn't new...), and that was just 2 years ago.You'll love things like the Mobius Strip, Unca Pharoah's, a club called The Haystack in a building called The Needle (666 stories tall? Interesting reference). Porge and Mud are at it again, but they aren't the main thrust here.Very well done. And, nice liner notes from the troup."
2,Not much better than Love Shelby,"I am Shelby Lynne was a hit. It had varying styles but it worked because there were a few great songs. She likes to try on different styles (blues, alt-country, boogie woogie, ballad). It can work if there are a few songs to hold it all together. Her stylistic diversity did not work in Love Shelby (sales were pathetic) and it does not work here. She is trying to do too many things and the album lacks a ""concept.""There was an interesting story about her in the recent issue of No Depression and it mentioned that she decided to reflect and regroup after Love Shelby failed. Maybe further reflection is needed."
5,"Shelby finally finds herself on ""Identity Crisis""","Shelby Lynne was once described as the country version of Sheena Easton. Like Ms. Easton, Shelby's albums have been hit or miss and she's dabbled in many different styles. With ""Identity Crisis"" I think Ms. Lynne has finally found herself. She's one of the best country/blues singers out there.Not only are her vocals at their best with this cd, I think her songwriting has never been better! Standout tracks after first listen are ""If I Were Smart"", ""Button's and Beaus"", ""Evil Man"" and the Patsy Cline-like ""Lonesome"".......but this cd is one of those you can listen to start to finish without skipping a track.All in all, this is the BEST in Shelby's career and definately one of the BEST cds of 2003!"
4,Comes across as anything but an identity crisis,"Identity Crisis comes across as anything but an identity crisis, instead finding Shelby Lynne in top form, focused, and sounding great. OK, maybe the crisis here is that Ms. Lynne runs the gamut from raging rock `n roll to laid back introspection and whatever else lies in between.Her voice is strong and clear, and her accompanying crew of musicians is clearly on board with her vibe and vision.I cannot see any value in offering a play-by-play recap of the songs here: just take the time to give this one a few listens and you can supply your own adjectives. Most of them will be quite positive, I suspect."
4,Treasure-Trove,"""Identity Crisis"" is a good set from Shelby Lynne. The diversity of musical approaches makes the title appropriate. ""Gotta Be Better"" is an excellent track with some blazing electric lead that lashes the speakers & Lynne's infectious vocals, ""And did you ever think you'd ever walk on hallow ground? Don't you like to think that things are lost & never found? Discover all the secrets & head out for the sound. Did you hear the voice that makes your fever?"" ""I'm Alive"" also has a delightful rocking groove, ""Oh if I don't get you back, I'll cover up my bloody tracks with sorrow, hopes & hide my dying pride."" The dreamy Shelby Lynne does Nick Drake track ""If I Were Smart"" communicates a soft gentle sadness that Shelby fills exquisitely. ""Telephone,"" ""10 Rocks"" & ""Baby"" are all great tracks. With ""Suit Yourself"" about to hit the market, ""Identity Crisis"" is still a treasure-trove. Enjoy!"
4,Cute romantic comedy,"I love the premise of this story; chocolate, chocolate confectionist, shy people in love. But story and directing is predictable and too cute.Arrived as described and promptly, A+++++"
5,Very Good,"Subtitles with movies French language adds to the appeal of this movie. Enjoyed it very much, one of the best I have seen recently."
4,"Cute, different, funny, odd...","This was funny but really odd. My husband and I found this quirky, funny, cute, and strange. The acting was excellent."
5,Great Movie,"We'd seen this on Netflix, and we order 3 of them as gifts for my wife's friends....charming and sweet movie!"
4,Completely Captivating!,This movie was simply adorable. I enjoyed the humor and the romance of the story. The subtitles were not even noticeable after a bit. The perfect confectioner for a rainy afternoon. Be sure to have some excellent chocolates available!
4,Charming romantic comedy,"Quite cute romantic comedy that manages to overcome being predicable in the broad sense with lovely performances, and a quirkysensibility that allows for smaller surprises within the established rom-com format.Benoit Poelvorode (in a 180 degree turn from his famous, chilling performance in ""Man Bites Dog"") and Isabelle Carre are both, indifferent ways, suffering from terrible shyness and fear of emotions and attention. Yet, when she comes to work at his chocolatecompany personality and fate keep conspiring to force them together, in spite of their fears.This has a few laugh out loud moments, and lots of smile inducing ones. In the end, it doesn't add up to more than what it is; ablissfully compact (78 minutes) good hearted romantic comedy done with expertise, but in a world full of painful and deadrom-coms, this is s very nice surprise."
2,Review,Characters didn't gel. I couldn't get past the fact she actually wanted a relationship with the guy. Movie itself was just ok
4,Good value,This is a study pot with a tightly fitted lid and handles that keep cool. It does seem to stain easily but is not too difficult to scrub clean. I've been quite happy with it for the price.
5,The perfect gift for a mother!,I got this saucepan for my boyfriend's mother and she adores it. She uses it all the time and it's completely perfect. Thank you so much :)
1,Cheap Product,"This product was super cheap. It says Japan on the bottom of the T in the middle of the watch, it's very small but it's there. The second I took it out of the box you could feel that the band was cheap. It looked and felt like something you would get at the .99 cent store. You could be better off going to the .99 cent store for a watch, Not worth the money for this item. I returned the item and will be looking for something more classy. Cheap, Cheap, Cheap."
5,"the world guide to gnomes, fairies, elves and other little people","My husband loves this book. He has been looking for a book that describes ""little people"" for a long time."
3,Hard to read....,"This was not an easy to read book. I am guessing that is due to how old it is, and people just don't speak that way anymore. It was interesting to see how people really believed in this and how they handled it. I think I read it a little at a time over a 6 month period."
3,Historical accounts,"I hadn't realized that this book was going to be a collection of historical accounts. Nonetheless, it was extensive; somewhat difficult to read as the sources were many and of different nationalities.You might try a modern-day, directly channeled book I just finished reading, ""If You Could Only See .. A Gnome's Story"" available here on Amazon, if you are looking to have direct experiences yourself. Written by Christopher Valentine, MBA and Christian von Lahr, PHD. There is also a Healing with the Fairies book by Doreen Virtue that is a more gentle read. This one, The World Guide, goes far to give you a broad world review on the little people from the many perspectives it has collected.Get them all if you enjoy the subject.Windy"
1,A ghastly edition of an otherwise interesting book due to poor typesetting,"This edition looks like someone typed this up on an early manual typewriter, that was made in the 1800's. Then it was ran off on an old fashioned copy machine, afterwards. The text is splotchy in some parts and parts of letters are missing in others. While some may not be bothered by that, I found it distracting and annoying."
5,AWESOME & HUGE,"Have had S&W products in the past & they were good quality and held up well. ordered this to play in the woods & it has not dissapointed me.very well made,very heavy,comes with a well made sheath@ sharpening stone.Arrived fairly sharp.I have filed the top side of knife to a hatchet type edge( it comes this way, but it needed more,the angle is already there ,so all you have to do is follow it). If looking bfor a BIG HEAVY KNIFE THIS IS IT."
5,BIG,"This knife is BIG and heavy,NIce G10 handles.Love the single full length tang.Impressive quality for the price!"
4,Huge and heavy!,"I got this knife to use as a spearhead and its great for that! However as a knife its big, bulky, and heavy."
4,Good Large Solid Tanto Knife,"It arrived on time and I'm overall pleased with it. The sheath is very sturdy and holds the blade secure. Slight abrasions left on the knife from re-sheathing but is hardly noticable. Weight is distributed evenly so the center of gravity is in the middle of the knife.Fun fact: This is the knife used by Gerald Butler, in the scene with Ken Castle, in the movie Gamer."
4,"Great Knife Made Out Of Great Materials For A Reasonable Price, There's A Cheaper One On Amazon Though",Title kind of says it all. I was suprised at how well the knife was made because of the price. The knife's made out of decent steel (440C) which is left very thick for and G-10 scales make for a very sturdy feeling grip.
2,"Decent Chip, poor feel","The chips themselves look good and having printed denominations is great, the problem is that the chips just don't feel good. They are too narrow to be considered a real ""casino chip"", but are too heavy to feel right. They do have a good clink with they are splashed, but just aren't that comfortable to play with. Many better options at similar prices going with clay chips."
4,Poker Chip Set,It is a very nice set. I like that it came with dice and 2 decks of cards as well. The only drawback for me was is does not have $50 chips and we start our big blinds at $50 and don't care to have all those $25 chips stacked up so I had to purchase separate $50 chips.
4,solid chips. Case is so so.,"The chips felt solid and heavy. I bought this because it has face value, so that we don't need to give face values to different colors each time. The case is so so. The case can close, can hold, can be carried. So it's Ok. But I wish it could be a little bit more elegant style. I am Ok to pay a bit more for a more decent case."
5,A woman's companion to life's challenges!,"This book is a must have for anyone who believes that life's challenges can be met head on--and for those who don't believe it, but want to. I have given this book to friends with cancer, infertility, miscarriage problems and have been told that it was one of the most helpful tools they received. Alice Domar combines traditional medicine and pharmacology with a mind-body approach. The book is full of helpful suggestions on how to cope-- a must have not just for those dealing with physical illnesses but also for anyone who is trying to get control over life and manage stress."
5,Valuable life tools for all women,"This book gives women the tools they can use to achieve peace of mind and cope with stress. As the authors promise, the book is as close to attending a real-life mind-body wellness seminar as one can get. Each of the early chapters focuses on a mind-body technique, such as: relaxation; proper breathing; emotional expression; self-nurturing; social support; and proper nutrition and exercise. Each technique is described in a simple way that readers can start doing them on their own. The last chapters each deal with a specific medical condition that are common among women. These include PMS, menopause, infertility, cancer, etc., and how the mind-body techniques can help to either alleviate the symptoms or at least enable women to cope with them.Examples from real women are inspiring. The authors have written a compassionate, scientifically sound, and thoroughly useful, practical book that's sure to help all women."
4,Pat McGee grows up,"Just like John Mayer on ""Heavier Things"", Pat Mcgee Band shows they have pure talent on Save Me. Personally, I thought ""Shine"" was incredible. ""Save Me"" holds its own, and you won't be disappointed. The good news is that some of the songs on this CD sound more radio friendly - so now maybe Pat Mcgee Band might actually get some exposure. Their label needs to help get their sound out there. TThis album has something for everyone, especially if you're a PMB fan. Don't buy this album expecting the same sound as on ""Shine"", because that's not what you'll get. However, it is a great CD that you'll be listening to over and over.PS. You gotta hear this band live if you haven't already."
1,if you liked Shine don't buy Save Me...,"I bought this because i really enjoyed Shine. Unfortunately, Save Me has an entirely different sound which is much more ""popular rock"" oriented with the typical quieter intros then blast 'em with the chorus. Save Me has none of the great guitar work in Shine and is lyrically very weak. I will usually keep a cd if it has even one song i like but this one is being donated to the library so i can at least take a tax write-off."
2,Disappointing,"I was not too impressed with this book. It was the third book on beading I had purchased, and I found it did not enhance my collection of beading books. It does have some interesting projects, but it offers limited information on techniques. I'd recommend it only for the specific projects, if you like them. For general instructions there are better book sout there."
5,I just couldn't stop turning the pages,Each page has brilliant designs and lovely pictures that are easy to follow.
3,No happy ending,"Can one give up drugs owe to prayers? Can one stop drinking owe to own faith in God? Can a rent boy give up his habbits and create a healthy relationship?After I have seen the film, I know the answer is ""no"".The end of love can have here several meanings. It's the love between mother and child (Ming and his mother), love between two lovers (Ming and Yan) or the love between two ""brothers"" (Ming and Keung).The message is obvious - love is the loser in the game of life. It was the first thought I had after I had finished watching the film.It's not one of those happy, light gay-theme movies. It's rather sad, depressing.Fair good, although its composition (retrospection scenes here and there) makes it difficult to follow at times."
3,IT IS WHAT IT IS,I WANTED TO SEE NIAGRA FALLS LIKE A TOUR NOT WHAT I WAS EXPECTING ALTHOUGH IF YOUR LOOKING FOR MEDATATING OR BORED TO SLEEP IT LIVES UP TO ITS NAME
4,a good reference,"The lectures are actually earlier versions of what went into _morals and dogma_. so what makes this interesting are the rituals... but there is no 33 degree ritual unfortunately. I have heard the ones used today are a lot different. kinda pricy for a photocopy reprint, but still well worth it."
5,I must get to the Island of IBIZA,"A two CD compilation of tremendous, upbeat, sensual, tintillating tracks.Sneaker Pimps, Groove Armada, Bjork with David Arnold (a fabulous cut!), Sueno Latino, Paul Van Dyk and thirty-one more tunes are included [My copy even came with sand--I hope not from a cat box!].This has got to be the very best compilation on this planet Earth. This hyperbole is intended to rein you in but the truth is the truth: a must-have!"
3,Redundant,"This is definitely not a must-have album by Chicane. I like a lot of Chicane's music, but most of the tracks from the 90's sound too similar. The ever present piano droning on in high octave keys, and cresendo drum rolls aplenty plague most Chicane tracks from this time period, and those featured on Chilled are no exception. Still, I keep a couple of tracks from this album on personal playlists (namely the first two).3/5 stars."
2,The Intentions Were Good,This is not a good CD. I give it two stars for two good songs (tracks 4 and 5). The album mastering is horrible. The mastering engineer made me hate listening to the songs. If you want to hear what I'm hearing play Jill Scott's CD and then play Neo Soul United CD you will hear the difference (especially on tracks 4 and 5). The intentions were good but I think Glory Records should have taken their time with the selection of the songs and the MASTERING.
3,"Good adaptation, but some glitches in play","This is a somewhat uneven adaptation of pac-man. In general, it has great graphics, good mazes, etc. It keeps the Pac-man playing style while adding nifty modern touches.The problem comes in the playability. I often found that I was fighting the game: slow responses at critical times, getting into situations where I couldn't see important things due to the field-of-view, etc.Hopefully they'll come out with a Pac-Man 2 that can clean up these glitches. If they do, it will be a fine game."
1,Try before you buy,"We bought Pac Man for our Gateway computer and found that it wouldn't run unless we rendered the graphics through the software mode which ended up making the game useless -- the graphics are so poor in software mode that you can't see what you're doing. We had all the requisite equipment, and the software's help file even said that it supported our graphics card, but in the end it wouldn't run from the graphics card and the technical support people at hasbro couldn't tell me why. We even tried it on another computer and while we didn't have the same problem, we had another one and were unable to run it there either."
2,"A very large book and too expensive, up-date it is hard...","This was an excellente book while the web did not exist, when there were 2 volumes and its cost was $250, but now with the web( that makes easier the chance to reviews)it is not that good. The other matter is that a group of orthopaedist have revised the last 4 editions and there are many things that the editor made as mistake, for instance when a technic is described some times the text says ""see the anterior edition"" (?). That is not good for a very expensive book. Now in this world of the internet we need shorter books and maybe with some kind of year book for up-date the text."
2,"Cute, but...","This kitchen sink strainer is a cute addition to an otherwise dreary sink, but its durability and construction materials are a let down. The bowl is made of chrome plated plastic which scratches easily and though the enamel coffee cup decoration has a body made of metal, the enamel filling is yet again plastic."
4,Highly Recommended,"Niagara is a typical example of games that win the ""spiele das jahres"" title (2005). It is a relatively easy game with not too many rules and lots of room for strategy. Luck plays some role but anticipating your opponents moves helps remove the luck factor. It doesn't take too long to play, about 30-45 minutes and only takes a couple of plays to learn how to strategise effectively. Highly recommended."
4,"Becky, My First Love",This is a delightful book written by Alice Kent Trimpey. The book contains true stories of how and where Mrs. Trimpey came to own many of the dolls in her vast collection. The dolls are described as well and pictures are added. Any doll lover and/or collector will find this book a fine addition to their library.
5,Author Was 1st Important Doll Collector in USA,"As a little girl, author Trimpey (b: 1864; d: 1949) adored her first doll, Becky--so of course she began collecting them. She wrote ""The Story of My Dolls"" in 1935, and ""Becky, My First Love"" three years before her death in 1946. She left her entire doll collection to the Wisconsin Historical Museum -- EXCEPT FOR HER FIRST DOLL, BECKY. ""Becky"" was buried with her."
3,Perhaps best of the series?,"This fourth volume of the Organic_Future series is perhaps the best, in that it combines new ideas and likable characters. Has a new setting, out in space. However like the rest of the series it will never make it to a list of 'truly great SF'."
5,Elaborating upon rational choice,"Rational choice theory was a breakthrough when first proposed, but political science remains uncertain what it really means. This book tries to explore the concept of reason and rationality further. It advocates an innovative, cross-disciplinary approach between social sciences and cognitive sciences in order to better understand human behavior. Some of the chapters explore external factors, such as institutions or the environment, while others focus more on the brain and biology. The book never really operationalizes much of its findings, but it does add nuance and make rational choice more palatable."
4,Informative book,"My mother recently had her thyroid removed due to cancer and this book has been a wonderful resource for her. She originally borrowed the book from her library and liked it so much that she wanted her own copy, which I bought her for Christmas. This is a great book with lots of valuable information."
1,Don't waste your money,"I borrowed this book from the library, and was very disappointed. Don't waste your money on this one - you can go to any allopathic (conventional) doctor and get the same limited information and ineffective treatment that this author recommends. Read ""Stop the Thyroid Madness"" or ""The Thyroid Solution"" for effective treatment options."
2,"Cute, but...","I bought this kit from a friend who wanted to get rid of it. I intend to give the completed kit as a gift.On the plus side, everything is included, right down to roof shingles and furniture. On the downside, the whole thing is made out of splintery, wafer-thin plywood (I actually broke a piece trying to punch it out of the board) except the trim, which is actually made of cardboard. No lie. Pieces often have to be sanded just to get them to fit together but you have to be very careful lest you wind up damaging them instead.I'll be handing this thing over to my friend's kids next week. Said kids are not at all hard on their toys but if this house has not been destroyed by the end of the month, I will be very surprised."
5,Just like reliving the concert!,"All I can say is ""WOW!"". After waiting years for the band to get back together, I got to see 2 shows this year. If I close my eyes while listening to the CD, I swear I'm back at those shows. It's a MUST BUY CD!"
5,Get Teslafied with Replugged LIVE!!,"If you have never been TESLAFIED, then this is the CD for you! If you want a truly LIVE CD from one of the best live bands, then again this CD is for you!! If you have seen TESLA live, then you know how great they are likely to already have this CD, if not, then this CD is for you!!! Since its release I have yet to stop listening to it and likely never will just like TESLA's studio albums! So go find the right page to BUY IT NOW.....you will NOT be disappointed!...You might want to join TESLA's great Fan Club for another Teslafying experience!!Take care,Steve"
4,Replugged Rocks,"I would just like to say i have recently purchased this cd,and it lives up to its name.They are Replugged and sounding better than ever.This cd gives Tesla fans just what they have been wanting,the band to reunite and give us the music we have been missing for many years.The 1st time I listened to it,it brought back so many good feelings.This band knows the true meaning of rock and roll and i highly recommend it!"
3,Not That bad!,"I found this book valuable in the development of my options trading strategy. I do not follow it to the letter but I think it provides great food for thought. It's not great, it's not perfect, but it's not horrible either for someone looking for ways to trade. Dr. Schiller has answered my e-mails to him every time I had a question. In summary, I believe there are better ways to trade credit spreads but I probably wouldn't be doing it at all were it not for this book."
5,Makes the AK much easier to shoot,The stock required a little work for it to fit (20-30 minutes) Once on the rifle it felt and looked great. It felt great at the range. I would recommend this as a replacement to the original stock and it adds one item for 922r. I did not like the handguard and ordered another which I like very much. I did buy this for just the stock.
5,A Gift for Hubby,"Very good Stock. Great quality. Easy to swap out (Hubby had to make a minor modification, as I recall)...no big deal. Nice Product!"
5,My everynight light,"Excellent lamp, with the smaller light just what is necessary to change diaper at night without waking the baby up. Great idea to buy it, I stongly recommend. The only small minus is the switch that is a little noisy, but it is fine."
5,The master does it again!,"Verne has done it again! Once again Robur takes to the skies in a new ship the ""Terror"". Except this time his conquest of the elements covers them all. Water(both above and below the waves),Land(racing across the land at 100s of miles an hour), and the skies(soaring with the agility of the birds). Mr. Stock, a goverment ageant investigating a strange occurence in the mountains, is accidently pulled aboard the Terror and sees the true genius and maddness of Robur. In the end the very elements Robur sought to conquer destroy him. Showing that only nature can stop the ""Master of the World""."
1,Time Has Killed This Book,"This book might have been exciting back in the day it was written, but given the context of our modern world, it's a complete bore. Written in a dry, matter-of-fact style that kills all the excitement & adventure, the wonder & mystery is ruined by modern technology as well as by the style of writing. The idea of a car, boat & plane is nothing to the modern imagination, but must have been a big deal back when the book was written. Maybe it was a great book a hundred or so years ago, but now it's just a snooze-fest."
5,WE8 Is The Best,I never feel more comfortable when playing the WE Soccer Series. WE8 is just the BOMB even though the older series were always the greatest.
2,Small,"I ordered the soaps thinking the soaps would be a bit larger... they smell nice, but a bit strong. Oh, and recieved 2 bars instead of 3."
4,Too fast,"Although I find this live performance to be an intense and compelling one, the tempos are noticably fast throughout, most markedly so in the first and last movements, more so than even the Bernstein-NYP account on Sony. This speed, I feel, detracts somewhat from the tragic weight and gravitas that this music should convey. For this reason, I cannot recommend this recording as generally and unqualifiedly as I have his live accounts of the composers 5th and 9th symphonies, also on Audite."
4,Mahler 6th,This is a very powerful performance. Truly historic in tone and intensity. You get a raw look into a great conducuors mind cdrom this performance.
3,A rushed and hectic Sixth that's not convincing,"I beieve in the maxim that the metronome is a bad critic. We aren't entitled to say that a performance is ""too fast"" or ""too slow"" without offering a more important judgment: Has the conductor found a way to make his tempo choices convincing? Much as I admire Kubelik's Mahler, I don't find his rushed, hectic account of the Sixth Sym. -- either his stuido version on DG or this very similar concert version on Audite -- at all convincing. This is music of sturm und drang. Mahler offers extreme emotional struggle and wild flights of fancy that take time to absorb. By glossing over the struggle, Kubelik misses the heart of the matter.His musicians play well, much better than those under Mitropoulos in his acclaimed Mahler Sixth in EMI's Great Conductors of the Century series. Audite's sonics are satisfactory, and there is an edge of excitement in the concert setting. All that said, for me Kubelik fails to express the essence of what Mahler is trying to say."
4,Romantic Barbra,"The only complaint I have about this album is that its tone is ""overall mellow"". It's definitely a ""background music"" album for a romantic evening. Which is not a bad thing. Barbra's renditions of these standards are good! My favorite is I FOUND MYSELF A TRUE LOVE. DRAW ME A CIRCLE is fine as well. The album finds Barbra in an introspective, idiosynchratic mood. Again, it doesn't play like a classic album (see THE BROADWAY ALBUM or PEOPLE) because there isn't enough diversity in song styles. But who's complaining! Barbra Streisand sounds so good in the 1960's. Her voice is young and her attack of a song is much more visceral than the Streisand we know today. Streisand has always been a studied vocalist, but oh, how sweet she is!"
5,amazing novel about future,"The author can keep the situations to the limit and surprise everybody with the conclusion of them. Bruce Sterling doesn't need to explain in detail the changes in the world to introduce the story, making quick the action. He uses a direct way to make himself understood, a cinematographic language. We expect to know some things about the main character for many pages and suddenly we arise the explanation. It's the best I have read for many time."
1,I couldn't put it down... fast enough.,"Nothing happened in the seventy pages I read. The author showed us around his hackneyed, dystopian future and introduced some characters with all the personality of storefront dummies who, like me, seemed to be waiting for something to happen (a.k.a., a plot).Science fiction is particularly vulnerable to having its storyline overpowered by concepts and gadgets. You see it in William Gibson's novels, a slow progression from storyline (""Neuromancer"") to something more like an anthropologist's field study (""All Tomorrow's Parties"").I am not partial to either ""Islands in the Net"" or ""The Difference Engine""--two earlier Sterling efforts--but at least they were readable."
3,Should have been a better read than it was,"Bruce Sterling is a puzzling writer. He obviously possesses talent and deep thoughts, but the sum of the parts rarely adds up. I found his non-fiction work, ""The Hacker Crackdown,"" to be quite well-written and readable. And the first short-story in ""Crystal Express"" was very entertaining.Too often, however, his books, like ""Holy Fire,"" are too byzantine to be truly enjoyable. It's not a question of having too much detail, or too many ideas -- qualities present in Neal Stephenson's more readable work -- there's something inexplicably inaccessible about some of Sterling's books.""Distraction"" falls somewhere in between. It never plods, and there are parts where Sterling's ideas and writing merge into a clarity and power that are remarkable. Yet, as a whole, the book never seems to rise above the level of a mere political thriller, which it clearly does not intend to settle as."
2,"So many good ideas, so little plot","Distraction shows why fiction was really mostly a warm-up for Sterling's current career as non-fiction writer and design futurist agitator. Distraction is peppered with crazy asides: reputation servers, rogue arms of the military, cloth phones.But there is no plot here, none. There are hundreds of pages where the story simply veers from location to location with a cast of characters that seems to grow and shrink for no particular reason. I defy anyone to summarize the central narrative of Distraction in a sentence or two. It can't possibly seriously be categorized as a ""thriller"", right?"
2,It Fizzles,"The book starts out with so many great concepts that it was really an easy choice for me to buy it on the basis on reading the first few chapters. And a lot of interesting things happen along the way to the end. But it strangely fizzles out before the conclusion, which is a major disappointment. In fact, there really didn't even quite seem to *be* an ending. I felt like someone must have chopped out the last hundred pages.Likewise, Oscar starts out as an intersting character but he never, ever changes and we never really seem to get inside of him or achieve any sort of understanding of him. For a character that seems so deep and interesting when you first assay him, you end up with the feeling that he's just an android spounting endless bits of dialogue to no real purpose.A shame. Read Schismatrix or Heavy Weather instead."
2,Walker Percy's Distraction,"I read Sterling's"" Distraction"" and though it was very clever until I read Walker Percy's ""Love in the Ruins"" published in 1971. I was shocked at the extensive borrowing from Percy that Sterling did to write"" Distraction"". The structure, plot, scenes, and the setting at the end of the world is just too similar to be coincidental. I recommend ""Love in the Ruins"". Percy is our american genius."
3,Not Sterling's best,"I was disappointed with this novel, which I don't feel reaches the levels of some of Sterling's past efforts. I will pass along a favor given to me--if you haven't tried Glenn Kleier yet, pick up a copy of his novel, ""The Last Day."" It is unquestionably one of the finest novels I've ever read. Enjoy! Elaine C."
2,Not distracting enough,"It was pretty difficult to get into this book, and I'm a big Bruce Sterling fan, but the characters were so jaded that I couldn't muster up enough interest to keep turning the pages and find out what happened next. Heavy Weather was much, much better... skip this one unless you have a long bus ride ahead."
3,"Hip, but Hollow","I like Sterling, and I've read almost everything he's written. This is not his best.Borrowing heavily on the background of his ""Chatanooga"" series of short stories this is a story that starts out being written with tongue firmly in cheek. However, the author slips repeatedly, and the result is uneven.""Distraction"" is worth the read for fans, but ""Holy Fire"" remains the author's best in recent memory."
1,Unfortunately very boring,"Fortunately I have read almost all other books by Bruce Sterling, ""Zeitgeist"" is already waiting on my bookshelf and I really hope it will be more entertaining than ""Distraction"" was. Distraction is somehow not a true Sterling novel. Too much is missing, to much is simply wrong. How can he imagine that cell phones and the Internet will work the same way in 2045 than they do now ! People still lugging laptops and phones hidding in their sleeves are truly 1999 stuff and feeling even already today outdated. The whole plot is constructed and does not feel right. Avoid this book !!"
1,Not A Distraction,"Full disclosure: I put the book down after 90 pages. I'd like to tour Bruce Sterling's mind sometime; it must be one hell of a ride. But Distraction, although chock full of Sterling's usual future visions, doesn't work. By the time Oscar got around to confessing his origin to Greta I knew I'd had enough -- it just wasn't working for me. If you're looking for a compelling distraction, look elsewhere. Great ideas or not, it's still the story that matters. If you must have this book opt for the paperback and save a few bucks."
2,Dissapointing,"I wouldn't have thought it possible, but here is a sci-fi ""Washington"" novel. That said, most of it takes place in Louisiana, but nonetheless, the novel is concerned with examining the political future circa 2042 via a Senator's campaign manager cum spin doctor. Unfortunately, this character, though whose eyes the whole novel unfolds is completely uninteresting. He seems to exist solely to drift in and out of more interesting lives and situations which are never really fully realized or tied together. While Sterling's vision of a heavily fragmented America, with crazy technology, uberpowerful nets, and soforth is all very well-crafted, and intriguing, the story itself is rather boring. In fact, so boring, I won't recount it here, nor will I recommend investing any time in this 440 page monster."
3,Vintage Sterling,"Distraction by Bruce Sterling will make you think until your dendrites grind while scaring the @#$% out of you, but you'll be laughing so hard you won't notice. By just nudging reality a tiny bit, Sterling shows us a possible and plausible scenario of what can happen when everybody's distracted by what's doable. In this future world with limitless internet and knowledge transmission the government becomes frightening and ridiculous at the same time, sort of like a rabid dog on roller skates that's being politically correct.Politicians think only politically and scientists think only scientifically, but everybody's bipolar. Throw in a hacker turned cop and red necked governor for color and let everybody believe they know exactly how people should deal with the massive changes in civilization wrought by technology and you get a schizoid tale that is alarmingly possible."
3,A Plausible Near Future Marred By a Poor Plot,"""Distraction"" was a genuine distraction for me, no pun intended. I was surprised that Sterling's exceptional writing slipped a bit here. He can usually be counted on for writing great characters and placing them in scenes filled with vivid, lyrical imagery, but I didn't care much for his characters and thought his writing was a bit haphazard. However, I was quite intrigued by his interest in information warfare; his scenario may be plausible. Those who have been satisfied with his past literary efforts may enjoy ""Distraction"", but it is a far cry from his finest work, most notably ""Schisimatrix"", ""Holy Fire"" and ""Heavy Weather""."
3,"A fun book, despite the plot","I picked this book up, because of the promise of a funny cold war story between the USA and the Dutch. Being Dutch this sounded quite appealing. Unfortunately this is not the major plot line in the story. I won't focus on the plot too much, it's a mildly interesting view on what could happen if we don't stop global warming. The thing I found most interesting and funny in the books were the little details, the road blocks, details about money etc.This is not a true page turner that will grip you from page 1, yet it's interesting enough to finish."
5,Well written and highly plausible,"I read ""Heavy Weather"" and thought it was fairly good but missing a dimension in the character development. Bruce Sterling has finally hit his full stride with this one. I got it for Christmas and had it read by New Years Eve despite incessant family obligations. Sterling's vision of the future is both highly entertaining and disturbingly plausible."
2,Disappointing Drivel,"Please understand that I thoroughly enjoy Sterling as a writer. but Distraction was a bomb. I read it all the way through hoping that eventually a plot would emmerge. It didn't.If you are a first time Sterling reader, PLEASE don't start with Distraction. It'll sour you to his writing. Start with Heavy Weather, or even go back so far as Schismatrix. You'll be much happier."
1,a waste of money,"This CD is essentially ""novelty"" songs, covers of American novelty songs: think ""Do the Makarana"" but worse. If you are new to Henri Samvador and liked chambre avec vue don't waste your money on this CD, it's nothing like that."
4,Wonderful seller!,The seller was very friendly and fun to with. I highly recommend this seller and would not hesitate to purchase from her again.
4,good single debut,I liked Paula on Leschea's album and I knew the single would be phat. She incorporates her smooth rap voice over a cathy sound. Look out for her debut album. Get this single for starters.
1,Bad News,"I got what I payed for. A cheap camera that does nothing.Save your money, it not even worth one star."
4,Brought back memories,I read this book as a child (many many years ago )and was delighted to seeit was still available.Great to be able to share this with my grandchildren
1,Poor Customer Service,"I purchased 2 of the Sitfit, one black and one red. The red one came with a plastic insert for air and the black one with a metal insert. The red one is fine, but I had to return the black one because it wouldn't hold air. I was very careful inflating it because of the instructions, but when I returned it, they said there was nothing they could do because there was a puncture hole. From my experience, when you puncture rubber it tends to close up, but this hole was open. I asked if they would return it and they asked for my credit card. I should not be charged again for shipping as at present I am out $60 with nothing to show for it. Obviously there has been a problem with the metal inserts so they have gone to plastic .... but that doesn't help me. I am very unhappy with their customer service!"
1,Justifiably obscure,"I was a little bit curious to hear these works of this composer I was unfamiliar with. As I listened to this CD, I found that I became completely bored with the music, and I am not sure why this artist bothered to give this music any valuable effort. Justifiably obscure pieces here that I would not recommend."
3,Not too bad for a racing sim,"First I would like to say that GP3 is better off for people who miss out or can't get GP2. The graphis on this game look like it came out in the mid 1990's.the AI in the game is amazing because they will force you off the road when you try to overtake them in a corner ,also when you crash the AI cars ram you like nothing is there.for the season mode I will advise you to go through it once.Overall this game could be fun but can be boring afer a while."
4,good racing game but old racing data,"i bought this game a couple of days ago from internet shoppingmall. and i real enjoy it. graphic is great ever i played befor this kind of game. but there is little problem to play this game. machine,driver and track are old one. all data are based on 1998, information from the web site, new add on comming soon(based on 2000 season) except this old data, gp3 give me great fun, and i reall enjoy it."
2,A letdown from Geoff Crammond,"Grand Prix 2 was a standout racing sim that confirmed Geoff Crammond as the world's top racing sim designer. GP3 should have been able to build on this success, but instead proved a disappointment. Although the graphics are much improved over GP2, the game setup is frustrating. The real kicker, though, was the game's refusal to work with either of the two wheel/pedal setups that I own. Playing a racing sim with the keyboard is not very rewarding. Grand Prix Legends is a far superior sim."
3,Sport Kickbacks,Okay- so I didn't get what I ordered. If I did- this would be a 5 star rating. The glasses don't look like what's on the picture. I don't know if Amazon messed the order up or what. I didn't get the modulators- I got polarized ones instead. Otherwise- the frames look the same. For right now I like em- but the real test would be to see if my husband likes these more than his old (broken) modulators that I was trying to replace.
5,"Bolle Sport Kickback Sunglasses,Shiny Black/Polarized TNS Gun","These sunglasses are a great value for the prize. They are lightweight, resistant to a reasonable level of abuse, and even polarized."
4,So far so good.,"The unit is a little bigger than the original unit, and does get a little hotter than the original. But all in all, it is functioning fine after a couple months."
1,freq replacement,I am on my forth one of these in 3 years. SEEMS LIKE HP WOULD MAKE A BETTER PRODUCT!
5,IMA - mazed!,"Every time I listen I get more and more drawn in by this band. Their catchy lyrics and up-beat rhythms hold your attention and, even if you're hearing it for the first time, you find yourself singing along. Great, great great."
4,Awsome,I wnated to give them 4.5 stars but there arent half settings. I know theres other older bands that probably sound like IMA Robot but I havent heard them. So I can safely say I havent heard anything like them. They kick ass and you should buy their cd when you see them live. So that way they get all the money you give them and just not a small percentage.
4,This Year's Surprise!!!,"I too caught them on Letterman and was blown away, something that just doesn't happen anymore. It reminded me of the old days of Saturday Night Live when I saw Devo, Talking Heads, B-52'S,Elvis Costello all for the first time.Yes they have sort of a retro new wave sound, combined with a little more modern aggression and a little techno vibe. Certain moments recall other artists (Devo,The Cure,Bowie,Dolby all come to mind)without blatantly ripping off anyone and coming together in a real original stew. It's great to hear Alex Ebert's vocal talent, definitely not an Eddy Vedder or Dave Matthews/Hootie mumbler here thank Goddess, which was what the major labels have shoved down our throats for over a decade. Hail the New Wave of New Wave!"
5,The Future of Rock Music,"This band clearly represents the single greatest step forward in popular music since the Beatles and the fact that my son is in the band has nothing to do with it. For God's sake, please buy it!!!"
3,Good cd with great production,The only problem is no tracks really stand out in my mind or stick in my head. Maybe after a few more listens.
1,Horrible,"I wish that you could give negative stars for these reviews. These guys are just a novelty band like the Hives, except (I never thought I would say this) worse than the Hives. Trust me, these guys will never have another CD"
1,ima robot! Can anything be worse?,"I had heard about Ima robot a little while back, and what i had heard about them was mixed, some people said they were horrible and nothing could be worse, while others said that they werent good, but they werent bad. However, i had to listen for myself. Seeing as how the reveiws were bad i wasnt expecting anything from this band ""ima robot"", but i wasnt ready for this. To sum it up its obvious that ima robot has little musical talent and that they shouldnt have a record deal, so... if youd like to check out some bands i do recomend taking back sunday, the blood brothers, franz ferdinand, the strokes, and the mean reds"
4,good.,"i saw these guys open for Hot Hot Heat, and they were awesome. their singer is a nutcase with a mullet.black jettas is a standout."
5,IMA ROBOT IS THE FUTURE,"Well, I don't know about that, but I needed a headline. This band is phenomenal though. I can't stop listening to it. Most of the time I listen to it while working out at the gym and it keeps you going like the energizer bunny. One reviewer here said no stand out tracks, thats because they are all amazing in their own way. My faves ""Scream"", ""Dirty Life"" and ""Lets Talk Turkey"" oh, and ""Black Jetta's"" oh and ""What Are We Made Of"" oh and ""12=3"", damn!!!!!!!"
3,A good start for this band,"Debut album from this group of mostly session musiciansbased in L.A. Kind of like a cross between the Stooges andDevo, with vocals that sound like the guy from Hot Hot Heat.Intentionally quirky, it doesn't always work, but when itdoes, it's fun, and it rocks. And when they mix some nice hooks into the middle of the chaos, as they do on ""12=3"", then you get a hint of the potential for this band."
