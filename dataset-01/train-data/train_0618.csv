5,Both educating and enjoyable,"Excellent. You will actually have a good time reading this if it is required for a class. There are plenty of funny antecdotes throughout. Many of the examples of people interacting seem like they could be happening now. The great thing about this book is that more than half of the material is ancient sources. Letters about marriage, politics, superstition, it is all taught by example, which takes you into the history much more. Wonder what the people actually thought about gladitorial combats? What happened when someone had to go travelling? If there's two sides to the story, both sides are presented in this book."
5,Fun read..for a textbook,This textbook is easy to read. Imagine Roman trivia and interesting translations and thats what you get here. I got it for a class but now that its over I keep it in my bathroom.
5,Amazing,"Not only was the book in amazing condition, but the seller of the book was nice too. She wrote a little note on my receipt and it was a nice way to add that personal touch! I am very happy."
1,The Daltons Surely Are Rolling Over in Their Graves,"I am not going to be kind to this movie, mostly because the great Randolph Scott is utterly wasted as the lawyer family friend who steals Bob Dalton's girl. The first 20 minutes are slow enough to put you to sleep, but then the action kicks in. The action is ruined by too much comedy relief, in the character ""Ozark,"" who renders what should be serious material into a one-man vaudeville act.In it's defense, the movie does have some good action scenes, but overall they are depicted so unrealistically and campy that these small benefits are lost. It's a shame, because the movie had the potential to exploit the Dalton legend and deliver a noteworthy film. Instead, the end result is a wacky, schizophrenic yuk-fest complimented by some furious action sequences and forgettable dialogue.For a better movie in the ""Universal Western"" series, try ""No Name On The Bullett,"" ""Whispering Smith,"" or any of the three recent Jimmy Stewart/Anthony Mann releases."
5,the wright way to start with rabbits,Befor adding rabbits to your farm or home read this book .it will give you a lot of info to get you on the wright track .more for the person wanting to raise rabbits for meat not much for the person with a cuddly pet in mind .a good fit for me as a hobbyist breeder-homesteader
3,Nice little book,Fine book covering the basics of rabbit raising.Nice chapter about building housing and identyfing illnesses.I approve this book as a useful book .
4,RELAX,"WAS A GIFT BUT SHE ENJOYS IT VERY MUCH ,,, THIS TYPE IS NOT FOR EVERYONE REALLY MELLOWS YOU OUT"
3,Chilling Beauty,"One of the most beautiful movies I ever seen. Although other reviewers point out that the weather is too good to be true, and the wigs bigger than life, I found the filming gorgeous. The candlelight evening scene gave me a real idea of what living without electricity was like. (I know that's kind of a mundane remark, but so many other period films show brightly lit rooms; there must have been shadows and wavering lights.) The end, though, revolted me, which is a tribute to Greenaway 'cause I can watch Terminator and action films without getting shocked by death. Scenes from this movie come back to my mind frequently over the years. I appreciate all the reviews on IMDB and Amazon (and the link--that's great), as this movie has haunted me for years, and I appreciate any hints. Now I'll go look for the Saragossa Manuscript reviews."
4,5x5,"This falls half-way between the gentle melancholia of 'Drowning by Numbers' and the sheer madness of 'A Zed and Two Noughts', this is shorter and, for me, less interesting than the later stuff. It's still very Nym-ish - bouncy rhythms, unorthodox instrumentation (electric bass guitar and saxaphone feature), and cyclic melodies that loop over and over, like techno but acoustic, are all present.It's also available in a boxed set with the following three albums (the above, and 'The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover'), with which it forms an odd union."
1,It looks attractive... but that's all,"This is probably the worst film I have seen, narrowly beating George Of The Jungle. The design is beautiful, with the sets and costumes serving a dull dull story, bereft of plot, characters, and interesting dialogue. Why Greenaway tried to write this himself, instead of employing a writer is beyond me. Michael Nyman makes a good stab at the music, but it is too dominant in the sound mix, and not subtle enough to complement the occasionally good photography. Add to the mix unnecessary music, actors who barely move when speaking their lines, many characters who look alike due to identical make-up or masks, and a pretentious pseudo-restoration English, and the result is an unintelligible mess."
1,Mystery Science Theatre 3000 Candidate,There should have been 2 robots and their builder in the foreground making fun of this movie! (a.k.a. Mystery Science Theatre 3000). I must say that this movie does answer the ? of what ugly men in big wigs would look like if they played with a lot of static electricity.
5,Essential Listening,"Michael Nyman's distinctive style first came to a broader audience through this soundtrack to Peter Greenaway's finest cinematic excursion. Such was Nyman and Greenaway's collaboration that Greenaway cut the film to rhythm of Nyman's baroque score. Heavily influenced by Purcell- sited as ""musical consultant""- this soundtrack stands in its own right as brilliant piece of work. Thouroughly enjoyable."
3,A Clever Little Picture,"Fairly tame by Greenaway's standards, this costume drama about a man hired to create a series of drawings of an English country estate is neither particularly tedious or grotesque, though since it consists mostly of short scenes in which a static camera watches people in wigs snipe at each other in formal 17th century prose, The Draughtsman's Contract does seem constantly poised on the edge of becoming a Monty Python skit. The plot, such as it is, concerns the way the pictures become infused with allegorical clues of adultery and murder, a kind ofBlow Upfrom before the age of mechanical reproduction. This being a Greenaway movie, however, the heart of the matter lies in the richness of the costumes and visual compositions, and a theme-and-variation style repetition of certain scenes. Not as accessible asThe Cook, the Thief, His Wife Et Al.orDrowning By Numbers, but still worth a look even by Greenaway's less fanatical fans."
2,Disappointed,"The picture in the ad shows multiple clown fish, as does the photo for this review. In reality there is only one tiny clown fish wrapped in a box large enough to hold 2 dozen of them. What a shock to find only one fish! KIt works and is cute, but definitely not worth the price we paid for it and s/h costs."
2,Would be great if they didn't break so easily,"I bought these for my little boy to play with in the tub. We didn't have them very long and two of them fell apart. We weren't rough with them at all, the tails just fell off and we were unable to put them back together. Now they float belly side up like dead clown fish. Nice bath time fun. Don't waste your money"
2,a little disappointing...,"i received this toy today, and i'm sure it will be a hit with my young son, i think they could have done a little better. i keep repeating the word little because the toy is so small you could fit two in the palm of your hand. the image shows four, you only receive one. buyer beware, yes the child will love it, the price isn't bad[...]"
1,disappointed,Picture shows four fish in several colors. Would not have paid that much had I known it was for one tiny fish.
3,Was fun while it lasted,"The colorful toy fish looks good and swims well. I bought a few for my kids to encourage them to take more baths. But after a few uses, the tail came off. Not very durable. So it was fun while it lasted."
3,nice but cheaply made,"Its kinda hard to wind up the fish and it mainly swims backwards i havent broke off the little piece under the toy that winds it up yet but i do feel like it could break easy, my daughter likes it because of the colors i think. the picture shows three fish but you only recieve one. its a cute toy to jus have floating in the bath tub for the baby to watch while you get them squeeky clean lol"
3,A Bit Of A Letdown,"Perhaps I should have waited for a second listen before posting a review, but I needed to speak out here. The reviews, the title of the cd, and my liking of his other efforts I have purchased recently, made this cd a must for me to find. When i finally got my hands on it, I was disappointed. First the sound is recorded at much lower a volume than some of his other works. O.K. it's not a remasterd cd but it was recorded a lot more recently, so I was expecting better quality. The vocals as one poster stated was much better and clearer. However the guitar seemed pushed far back in the mix. His other cd's are better and bluesier."
5,"An emphatic ""must-have"" for any tourist interested in visiting the Navajo and Hopi nations","Now in a fully updated and expanded second edition, Native Roads: The Complete Motoring Guide To The Navajo And Hopi Nations by Fran Kosik continues to be the definitive travel planning guide for anyone seeking to visit and explore the reservations and hospitality of the Navajo and Hopi peoples. Maps, black-and-white photographs, cultural etiquette tips (for example, Hopis do not allow any photography), self-guided road tours, in-depth descriptions of various locations, and tips on everything from how to discern a well-woven rug to avoiding or dealing with common environmental hazards fill this extremely practical guide cover to cover. An emphatic ""must-have"" for any tourist interested in visiting the Navajo and Hopi nations for business or pleasure."
5,Hopi & Navajo Road Trip Guide,"I'm just going to quote Tony Hillerman, he says it best: ""NATIVE ROADS is loaded with all sorts of helpful iinformation, well designed, easy to use. Don't head for the reservation country without one."""
3,"Good, but in need of better editing.","I decided to read this since I was in the mood for a literary mystery and I'm always lured by literature of the sea. This was the first Perez-Reverte I've read & even though I was somewhat disappointed, I'm sure I'll read more.The story itself is very well told and the characters are fascinating and wonderfully drawn, the mood is well cast, and as the story slowly unfolds it demands your attention and keeps you guessing. The ending while not unexpected, still has enough twist to be satisfying.I only wish that the editor had demanded that - 1) Coy's constant ruminations on Tanger had been tightened up. 2) We hadn't been given excessive navigational history. Although some of it is important and interesting. 3) The first-person narrative that appears in the beginning and toward the end would be dropped. It's unnecessary. 4) There'd been a map."
3,A Great Disappointment,"I loved The Club Dumas, The Queen of the South, and The Fencing Master. I felt The Seville Communion had some of the same problems as The Nautical Chart--although it was a far better book. I was not convinced by the protagonist's obsession in either of the books. But the mystery is more developed in The Seville Communion, and so that book is suspenseful and persuasive from the very start.The Nautical Chart, by contrast, is not exciting until the last few pages, and the protagonist seems to be a jerk who cannot control his temper. The woman he falls for is not a sufficiently rounded character for us to ever know her or care about her. And therefore her turnabout at the end is hardly the betrayal it could have been.Well, I was very disappointed. I found the book irritating and hard to complete."
1,What a disappointment!,"After reading all the other books by this author I was eagerly awaiting this one. However when I finally labored through it I was very disappointed. Perhaps it is partially the translation, as I noted yet another translator was used. But the story line lacked the interest of the others. I wanted so to enjoy it and it wasn't meant to be. Will there be another? Probably not for me!"
2,The Nautical Chart,"Having such a high regard from his previous novels, I was unprepared for a Micky Spillane theme, not his forte."
4,"A sailor, the sea, and a mystery","I always look forward to books written by this author, because I find them well-written, with a literary quality so often missing in modern fiction. This new book is no exception, for the language and the writing are, as usual, first rate. My one caveat is that this is an extremely slow plot, and you keep wanting to say to the author, ""Get on with the story!"". Once he advances the plot, everything is fine. The characters are always well-drawn, even those who don't have a lot to do with the story. The writing covers a lot of literary ground, and if you're not ""up"" on writers about the sea for the last 150 years or so, you're going to feel a little lost. The plot, once it gets moving, is quite absorbing, and held my interest. I just wish the author would ""get to the point"" a bit more swiftly, which I feel he can do without sacrificing any of the good qualities which make his books so anticipated by myself, and many others of his ""faithful readers""."
2,Disappointed,"Having read Perez-Reverte's other novels (my favorite still is Flanders Panel), I was rather disappointed with his newest novel. Yes, the story is interesting and research amazing. However, the characters were too flat and the plot too obvious. What happened to the great plot, twist, shock? I am sorry to say that I was disappointed with this book - but do highly recommend his other books!"
1,disappointment,"i bought this book because this author wrote one of my favorites - The Queen of the South. that book is one i would call excellent. so i bought three others from him, and they were all less than mediocre. i never even finished them. that includes The Nautical Chart. It's cover is better than the contents. i actually read half of it, waiting to get interested, and never was."
1,Disappointed,"I am a big fan of Perez-Reverte and have read all his books - I wish my Spanish were good enough to read them in the original. However, I was very disappointed at this latest book, which has an interesting premise and is obviously thoroughly researched. But the characters are flat and the plot obvious. What happened to all the exciting twists and shocks?"
1,Hugely disappointing,"I am a fan of Arturo Perez Reverte, and waded through this book. Sorry I did. Stupendously boring, I'm sad to say. I could find nothing to recommend. Give it a pass."
2,A Wordy Bore,"Don't bother! The author must have been paid by the word he used so many. Written in the style of ""It was a dark and stormy night"", it's Over-ripe withlong florid meaningless sentences. To quote Wm. Shakespeare, ""Much ado about nothing"".However, its worst sin is...Predictability. One can figure out the whole story very early on. Shame !It might have been fun, but it was just plain boring.Misunderstood hero, Mysterious lady, Evil rich man, Violent dwarf/henchman,Sunken treasure ??You HAVE to be kidding! Sigh !"
5,Well I liked the book.,"I liked the characters and the end is surprising as well as the girl's true motives. I didn't like it as much as dumas club or that book he wrote about chess, but you know; it read well, so I was happy. And yeah, maybe sometimes it is a bad translation, but this book wasn't as bad as they were making it out to be."
3,A pretty good bouillabaisse of a sea-story,"Perez-Reverte is one of my favorite authors, and this is not one of the best of his novels, but then, it isn't too bad either. While engaging and colorful, with some good characters (the dwarf Argentine commando is particularly well-drawn), it tries too overtly to be too many things, mostly hard-boiled adventure stories and films; hard guys and delicious dames in deadly search of fabulous treasure: The Maltese Falcon, The Deep, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, Beat the Devil, The Odyssey, TinTin's Adventures, The Da Vinci Code ... Great stuff that Perez-Reverte chops, dices, and sautes into a pretty good bouillabaisse of a sea-story."
3,"Work of fiction, not a work of art","This is a typical treasure hunting book with a predictable story featuring a beautiful heroine, a rugged hero dreaming of sleeping with the heroine, a vilain and the lost Jesuit's treasure - all the necessary attributes of New York Times' bestseller. Saddly, so much (unnecessary) emphasis was given to the heroine that at times it read as one of those sleezy romances in the bookstore' romance section; somewhat racy remarks towards Filipinos, Ukranians, Indians and other nationalities too frequent to be a coincidence, emphasized the author's peculiar bias, not surprising given the author is a spaniard. Overal, do not expect too much from the novel."
2,Disappointed,"I love books that involve the sea. I had just finished reading Phillip Caputo's ""The Voyage"" which may tell you something about the level of writing I had come to expect and hope for. Now, like many people, I have my 100 page rule. If I'm not engaged by 100, I'm done with the book. I made it to 169 in this book before invoking the 100 page rule. I should have stopped but at least the story line was interesting enough to keep me going that extra 69 pages. But I just couldn't stomach it anymore. I just didn't care one whit for any of the characters.I've never read this author before and I don't know if this is indicative, but with so many books in the world left to be read and with so little time to do it in, this author's work will move to the bottom of my priority list."
3,"good, not great","If you have not read Perez-Reverte before, start with The Flanders Panel, or The Seville Communion, or The Club Dumas. If you have read some of this author before, you will recognize the m.o.: This time he gives us great detail about the life of a merchant seaman, ancient cartography, and jazz music. Much like The Fencing Master, this book is slow the first half, then picks up around page 200 and is off to the races, with a Perez-Reverte style twist at the ending. I would place this ahead of The Fencing Master, behind the others. It wasn't great, but I enjoy reading his work and was glad I read it."
2,A world of boring. A raging sea of boring!,"2 stars for decent writing (at least a decent translation), for an intriguing start, and for the occasional appearance of a melancholy dwarf. That's pretty much it. Negative stars aplenty for the protagonists -- Coy and Tanger (I listened to NC on 13 endless tapes, so perhaps am misspelling their names). The tortured metaphors they speak, think, and by which they -- and their insipid adventures -- are continually described, bore to tears. Aside from an occasional scrape between Coy and the aforementioned dwarf or his boss, all of the action in NC clusters at the beginning (promisingly so, I'll grant) and the end (all wimper, no bang) of this novel. As a salty seadog once said (no doubt anticipating this novel), ""Ahoy matey, thar. She blows!"""
1,slow,"After reading La Piel del Tambor, I couldn't wait to read another book by this author.I'm halfway through reading this book and feel like it hasn't started yet. I'm finding it incredibly slow. Plus all the nautical terminology is quite hard to understand by a 'lay' person."
3,Slow moving,"I have enjoyed several of this author's other novels, although The Seville Communion left me cold. My reaction to The Nautical Chart was similar.The opening is good - gets the reader involved straight away. From there, as others have mentioned, it just takes too long to unfold the tale. I enjoyed the nautical and local geographical details, but the main characters speak in riddles and world-weary pauses just too often. After a while, you feel like telling them to wake up and stop being so melodramatic. This seems to be a feature of this author's style - I even found it difficult to identify with or like the characters in the books I enjoyed.The ending does compensate in some ways, but it left me feeling pretty depressed about the fate of all the characters. It would make a good film noire movie!"
2,Could have Been Better,"The Nautical Chart could have been a better book if, its author had eliminated about 50 to 100 pages. The story dragged. I read it at night in bed and I kept falling asleep. The book does have its merits. The information regarding navigational instruments and history was interesting and was exciting at times. The ending was good (the best part of the book). The relationship between the Coy and Tanger had shades of James Caine and Jim Thompson. Even so, I would hestitate about recommending this novel."
4,brief remarks,"I've read all of Perez-Reverte's works and believe that--as a mystery--this one falls a bit short. The protagonist, however, is one of his most interesting and thoroughly developed characters, a sailor who instills this ""roman noir"" with great depths of poetry and heart."
4,A thrilling novel,"Spanish best selling author Arturo Perez Reverte has made a great book, a mixture of a thriller and a homage to the sea novel. Starting off in a contemporary maritime auction in Barcelona, the plot deals with a treasure hunt for a Jesuit ship sunk by pirates off the mediterranean coast of Spain in 1767, as a suspended sailor and a beautiful curator from Madrid's Naval Museum try to track the ship's final resting place just a few steps ahead of the bad guys who also want a portion of the loot. A very entertaining read, that also shows Perez Reverte's erudition and skill at writing a great yarn."
2,Down Among The Dead Men,"Ok, let me say this, I imagine that something is lost in the translation. I must admit to Americans Artuor Perez-Reverte is probably an acquired taste, as he is with me. If you are a fan you'll end up reading this book. Perez-Reverte in this book spends an awful amount of time on Manuel Coy's background and dissatisfaction with life and himself. All the other characters are very cardboard-like, except when one chapter is written in first person. Perez-Reverte books are usually mysteries, but this one isn't. And his translator is new. But for me, there is something about his books that I like, even the ones that don't fire on all cylinders."
3,Could have sailed further with a little less wind...,"I agree with the general impression given by other reviewers that something was amiss here. At the beginning the book swept me up immediately; in crafting a plausible tale of a 1767 shipwreck and the existing documents which would allow it to be found today, Perez-Reverte was at his best; and those who enjoyed his invented histories for the Ostenburg characters in ""The Flanders Panel"" will certainly find the same skilled artistry here. The book kept wind in its sails until the characters actually set sail; then the monotony of their search came to mirror the monotony experienced by readers, and when the pace suddenly picked up again with an unexpected, though perfectly expectable, triple-cross surprise ending, the sudden return of speed was as jarring as a Carribean storm. Perhaps an editor with a sharper knife or more ink in his pen might be all that was needed here. (Note: I read the Spanish version)"
4,"Beautiful story, but a rushed ending","As another reviewer said, a good book but not up to the usual Perez-Reverte Standard (Like Club Dumas or The Fencing Master which are truly wonderful).I felt the novel lost its wind (excuse the pun) when Nestor Perona, the narrator, introduced himself. And I lost interest... Things seemed too easy too expected from there on.Too bad, because the beautiful lengthy narrative describing the life at sea, the naval and political strategies, the Dei Gloria, the relationship between Coy and Tanger, and the search along the Spanish coast had kept me riveted to the book.The end seemed rushed and the final intrigue improbable. (I won't give more details not to spoil it for those who have not read the novel... But I could have read 200 more pages about the search at the bottom of the sea.)(Note: I read the French Translation of the book ""Le cimetiere des bateaux sans nom"".)"
1,Don't Buy USED!!,"Do NOT attempt to buy this book used. It can only be used once, due to a login code that comes with the book. As much as this book and the game it describes are worthless, if you are required to have this book, just pay your fee and try as hard as you can to convince your professor that this game is a waste of time. There are much better ways to learn how to run a company and to find the maximum point of a profit curve."
5,Gorgeous,"It's not hummer season yet, but these feeders are true works of art. Very fragile, but was well packed and arrived in perfect condition. Even if the birds don't take to them (which I doubt), they're beautiful just hanging from our pergola."
2,Form before function,"While this feeder is beautiful blown glass, sadly the hummingbirds aren't interested in it. Also, the product description states ""2 per case"" and I received only one feeder, so make sure you actually get your $ worth or contact Amazon."
2,Beautiful yard decoration,"If you have to have it just buy it as something pretty to look at, the hummingbirds will not drink from it."
3,MY REVIEW OF IN HOME INVESTING,"VERY BASIC! THIS WAS TO BASIC TO BENIFIT ME. TALKED ABOUT WHAT IS A STOCK, BOND, MUTUAL FUND, COMPOUNDING INTEREST. GENERAL OVERVIEW NOT VERY INDEPT. THE PRESENTATION WAS NICE CLEAR AND EASY TO FOLLOW. THIS IS NOT REALLY MUST BENIFIT FOR ANYONE WHO AND ANY KNOWLEDGE IN THESE INVESTING AREAS. BE WARNED VERY BASIC!"
4,Colonial America Pictoral,"Wendell Garrett once again produced another great collection on fine furnishings and architecture. There is great range from simple colonial design to grand represented in this book. I highly recommend this to anyone who is interested in colonial furnishings and architecture, or who simply likes the finer things!"
4,"Beautiful Photos, Great Descriptions","This book has very good photos and good details about the buildings, and what it materials were used to build them!"
1,"Good photography, not much else","Do buy if you want a coffee table picture book. Also if you want something that focuses on New England. Don't buy this if you want a scholarly work, which it is not. Also, don't bother if you want something that gives a good overview of colonial buildings in the South, as you will not find it. The entire first one hundred years of Southern colonial seems to be summed up by statement that Virginia settlers were ""unruly and not given to hard work."" The photos of 18th century houses in Virginia and the Carolinas usually discusses the furniture and where it was made (usually New England) rather than the architecture of the house."
2,3 LIVE RECORDINGS,"I am disappointed with my purchase. Didn't pay attention (small prints) to the album description when I bought this in HMV store. Sound quality is poor. Three of my favourite songs (Release Me, Still, and After the Lovin') were recorded live."
2,Inferior live recordings mixed with studio covers,"I thought this quality of recorning to be available only through bootleg - not from a major like Sony. With some of the audience background sound having better clarity than the artist (Release Me) (After The Lovin'), I believe this disk would sound better when played through a boombox priced under $35."
2,Big Disappointment,"This collection consists of live versions from later in Humperdinck's career, and cheesy, souped-up studio re-workings of his earlier hits. These are not the versions you grew up listening to. The cover itself is deceitful. It shows him as a much younger man that what he was when these versions were recorded. Had they put a more chronologically accurate picture on the cover, it might have helped many people to avoid purchasing a CD that is not what it appears to be. This is truly false advertising for the sake of profits. If you're an Englebert Humperdinck aficionado, and already have the original recordings of all his hits, you may appreciate these alternate versions. If you're like me, and are looking to include a good ""best of"" of Engelbert Humperdinck's music (the way you remember it) in your collection, search elsewhere."
1,Lies! Lies!,"I haven't even listened to it yet, but I'm giving it one star because there is no indication on the cover that these are cheap knock-offs and live versions. That's outright fraud."
2,It's no GT 2110,"Although I am still loyal to the Asics brand, I have to say that the 2120 is very different to the previous models of the 2000 series. I noticed differences in the support (if you're overpronated) when I started to get knee pains after the first day in them and now after only 5 months I can see the inner lining of the shoe start to wear away. I still own and use my GT 2110 which has no wear and tear although it has had more mileage put on it. My advice is to wait for the GT 2130 and hope that Asics made the necessary improvements to make that a comparable model to the GT 2110. Chances are if you aren't going to put that many miles on the shoe that it might meet your running need but for that price, why settle!"
2,Not so great,"I have been running for a few years and loved my asics 2110's. So, I was really excited when the 2120 came out. However, they don't fit as well as the 2110 and my knees have started to hurt with them. I never had a knee problem with the 2110. I am thinking of switching to the kayano line to see if those are better shoes for me."
3,Bring back 2110,"I have 6 pairs of the GT-2110 and have worn Asics for years. I was really looking forward to the 2120, howevere I was so distraught when I wore my 2120 just one day around the house. They are supposed to have only minor changes, but whatever those are severly hurt my feet, making them feel bruised. I tried wearing them a round a few more times to break them in (which technically should NOT be required of running shoes), but each time I feel the pain. I went out and horded as many 2110's as I could find, but now I'm faced with the need of a new pair but will NOT purchase 2120's and caution folks planning on buying them to make sure you can return them if they cause you similar discomfort."
2,"If you like 2110, this is not your shoe",I have been wearing the GT 2080s and the GT 2110s for years now. These shoes are a big disappointment. The heel slips and they are not comfortable. I would advise choosing something different if you loved the 2110s. These shoes are a big let down.
5,Asics 2120 Review,"Yeah, pretty much the best shoe known to man for those of us with flat feet. I love the fit of this shoe. I wear it in a half a size bigger than my regular shoes and it is such a comfortable ride. The 2130's are as equally great!"
4,always asics,"Since I started running 13 years ago,I have never worn anything but asics shoes.At 56 I have to be careful what I put on my feet to keep my body in proper alignment.These shoes fit like slippers and give my feet support which I need because I have high arches and also have an ankle that was snapped from an accident years ago.This shoe gives me room in the toes, no pressure on the back of the heel, roominess in the width, and I like the colors.Also, the laces stay tied, that's huge.My only beef is that I wish it had a slightly higher arch support."
5,Great running shoe!,As a first time runner I was looking for a shoe that has great cushioning and stability and this shoe is it! I tried another brand but the jarring was too harsh. I wear this shoe as an every day shoe as well!
5,This is hilarious and irreverant.,"I saw this intelligent, highly creative and entertaining movie in the movie theatre. Everyone in the theatre was laughing out loud. I honestly couldn't believe some of the bizarre situations I was watching. Universal Remote has a universal appeal. I'm definitely buying a DVD, in fact this would make a great stocking stuffer for my friends and family, well maybe not my grandmother."
1,Didint even work!!,"When i first saw this movie on the television i wanted to buy it but couldint find it in any store. So when i found it online i was happy and bought it right away. Now the shipping wasint that fast but its ok, the problem...the real problem was that the cd didint work. No scratches were on the disc which made no sense to me but when in my dvd player (Newly bought at the time) it did not work. It would freeze right after i hit the play button the dvd menu. Im mad about this i lost money!!"
1,Don't drop it,"When I got this thing I thought it was pretty neat as all the different spray settings offered lots of fun watering the flowers, the grass, the car, and anybody who got close. Then it got dropped on the driveway and instantly started to leak backward out of the turret. I think I had this thing well over a year and loved until that one day. After it got dropped on the driveway it was done."
2,Food that doesn't inspire,"I just cooked the Green Mussel Salad tonight and was pretty disappointed. I've tried a couple other recipes in this book and have also been disappointed. The recipes I've tried don't inspire or even satisfy. I haven't found a Spanish cookbook yet that does, to be fair, but I keep looking."
2,Not udon noodles.,These are not traditional udon noodles.. these are flatter noodles and are not as chewy. It's not a bad noodle but it says Udon and it is not udon.
5,Nice,Really plays good and my girl's Dad loves it. He's always talking about how much he likes it. And nice price too.
4,GREAT!!,"This album of theres is not there best but i love it! I think the reason being for them only putting two new songs on this album is so they can get better known in America. Rockapella is growing in popularity High schoolers. I am a juinior in high school and i have been a fan for longer than most teenagers, But almost all of my friends, when they heard Rockapellas folgiers commercial, loved it. And when they found out that they have recordings out, they imediatly bought them. Rockapella will get to be known more and more as years progress."
5,Groovin' Acappella!,"From the first note to the last note, this is a great CD! My personal favorite song is ""Moments of You"" because it has a good beat which is provided courtesy Jeff Thacher (vocal percussionist) and Barry Carl (bass vocal). This is one CD you won't be sorry you bought!!"
4,It is a good album but...,"I know that this cd is a good one but I do believe that Rockapella 4 Vocobeat is better. It gets more into the essence of their voices and utilizes harmonies better. The new cd is more about vocal percussion since the new guy signed on. Don't get me wrong, it is a great addition to their style but I loved what they did with the barber shop meets detroit sounds. I give it four stars because I am usually a fan of groups earlier works before they go nation wide. Rockapella 4 and priors were all produced in Japan and imported from Great Britain which also explains their high price. When you don't have to pay those or sell out, you can do it how you want. Good job Rockapella...you put out another great."
5,Infectious and enjoyable!,"I stumbled across this CD and didn't think twice about buying it. I have loved this group since their stint on ""...Carmen Sandiego?"" Now I can listen to them everyday and I do. I think my favorite song is the title track, Don't Tell Me You Do, an acheing post break-up anthem to the ex who haunts you still."
3,"Fine sounds, but rather boring.","The best track is the Folgers track and the first track ""Moments of You"". The rest are somewhat boring, though the voices are good.If you want fun, cleverness, excitement and peppy tunes go for something by the ""Flirtations""."
5,LOT OF NUMBER 1 HITS IN MY BOOK,"THESE GUYS HAVE DONE IT AGAIN!!!! I REALLY LOVE THE ""FOLGERS"" BONUS TRACK. KEEP UP THE AWESOME WORK..THIS ALBUM IS TRUELY ""THE BEST PART OF WAKEING UP""...!!!!!"
5,This CD Rocks!!,"Refreshing tunes and great melodies from these guys. Who'd have thought; the guys from Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego have their own CD. Well, they do and it's AWESOME!"
5,The Best Music Around,"When I first heard these guys they knocked my socks off with the sound. In today's music all the computer added stuff, they have none of that, it all the sounds a body or voice can make. This album is a must for anyone who loves basic music."
5,One of the Best,"I've owned this CD for less than a week, but I'm totally in love with it already! Unlike ""Rockapella 2"", the songs on this album encompass many musical styles - from jazz (""I Am Your Man""), to pop (""On The Last Night"" and ""Ellie My Love""), to smooth R&B (""So Much Better""). Different emotions are also invoked... ""Song 9,"" while a little nonsensical, is a flat-out fun ditty that puts me in a good mood; ""A Change In My Life"" is inspiring; the funky, appropriately titled ""Lift Up"" is, well, uplifting; and the beautiful title track is heartbreaking.If, like me, you missed the now out-of-print ""Rockapella"" CD, this one is a must have. This album won't disappoint."
1,Say What?,"I have been a fan of Rockapella since I heard them sing on The Tonight Show one new years eve. I just bought Rockapella Two-From N.Y. and loved it. However, this album was very disappointing. When I heard they added a vocal percussionist, I was worried, and my worries were right. I wouldn't have a problem with it(there's vocal percussion on ""Two""), but he's just two loud! And he's on every song. They destroyed A Change In my Life by adding him. The whole thing is over-produced, you can't tell what their voices sound like, and you can barely hear the bass. All in all, not a very pleasing experience compared to ""Two."""
5,Wow!- Don't tell me you haven't heard this CD.,"Three years ago, I was dragged by a friend to see Rockapella perform at the Bottom Line in NYC. Now, I am pulled to see them anytime. Hooked and delighted this group, has amazing talent- what voices! This CD, in particularly, is Rockapella at their best. It has the right combination of Rock, R&B, jazz and more. You'll want to listen to it over and over again."
2,Just OK,"This lotion has good mild ingredients, but I don't like the smell (unscented products all have some kind of smell) and it's not moisturizing enough. I'm using Aveeno moisturizing with oatmeal, Vanicream and Curel ultra healing instead."
1,Not what it used to be (it burns),"This was the first lotion we used for our son when he was born, and it was wonderful. After about a year, our original supply ran out and we ordered more. My son would start fussing when I applied it to his face. He never liked people messing with his nose or his face, so I didn't immediately catch on that it was causing discomfort. It wasn't until I applied it to my own face and it burned that I realized what was happening. Needless to say, I felt very guilty about putting this lotion on my son.I found out that the creator of California Baby sold her company, and this new company has replaced several of the natural, safe ingredients with artificial ingredients. As others have mentioned, one of the new ingredients is sodium benzoate, a salt of benzoic acid (benzene) that is used as a preservative. Originally, California Baby used vitamin E, which is more expensive but safer and natural.As such, I am now looking for a new lotion for my son."
1,New formula stinks (literally)!!,"UPDATE: I got a bottle of the new formula (new design and smaller pump) and it was awful! It had a funk smell...not sure how to describe it, my husband thought it smelled like moldy towels. It also went on different, felt thinner and cheaper. So gross, had to return ASAP. Also, it's cheaper in stores than on Amazon. ORIGINAL POST (5 Stars): I love this lotion for my baby girl. Goes on great and absorbs quickly. It's like the baby version of Body Drench original (my fav lotion). The bottle is pretty small so it is really expensive, but if it works...it works. Great product!"
1,Didn't Work for My 3-Month-Old Son,"My son has mild eczema but this lotion didn't work and made him cry. After switching to Cerave, he cried no more and I saw big improvements on his skin."
5,Great Product,"Just the right consistency. Absorbs well, and cleared up my baby's dry skin eczema within days of use. Not a super pleasant scent, but then again, it's not scented: so that's the whole point. If it smelled nice, it would probably contain an unnecessary and potentially harmful ingredient. The smell is kind of rubbery, but not very strong, and I don't smell it except when I am putting it on."
5,Great for sensitive skin,"I was using Johnson & Johnson baby lotion on my baby boy and he had always had this acne look like bumps on his face and wrists. I thought they were just baby acne but I do notice the bumps are more prominent after bath and lotion. I heard from a friend about California baby products so decided to give it a try. I bought this sensitive body lotion and also the sensitive shampoo & body wash. After just one wash, the bumps were already looking better so I continued to use this product and the acne look like bumps are now all gone. I am waiting to try the California Baby's sunscreen but so far, I am loving this brand and would recommend for all babies."
5,A Lovely Lotion for People With Sensitive Skin,"I used this lotion on my son when he was an infant and liked it so much I am using it on my baby girl. It is free of fragrances and harsh ingredients, so it is even safe to use on their faces. I also love how light weight it is--fast absorbing is especially important when dealing with a squirmy baby.I also use the California Baby Super Sensititve Shampoo and Bodywash and love it."
1,CHANGED FORMULA,"California Baby has changed its formula and now includes Sodium Benzoate.From Natural News:""Derived from a reaction of benzoic acid with sodium hydroxide, sodium benzoate is actually the sodium salt of benzoic acid. Sodium benzoate is a known carcinogenic additive which, when eaten or applied to the skin, gets transported to the liver, where it is supposed to be filtered, and expelled in urine, but the damage gets done before that process is completed.Sodium benzoate chokes out your body's nutrients at the DNA cellular level by depriving mitochondria cells of oxygen, sometimes completely shutting them down. Just as humans need oxygen to breathe, cells need oxygen to function properly and to fight off infection, including cancer.""Learn more: http://www.naturalnews.com/033726_sodium_benzoate_cancer.html#ixzz1k3hUQkWZEven outside of that article there is great concern about the ingredient and cancer links. I will be returning my product and no longer purchasing from California Baby."
2,"hurts, not for sensitive skin!","I mainly use renew melaleuca lotion for my b/g twin toddlers as they have mild eczema, but this lotion is too hard to come by, so I was opting to try some organic lotions that are supposed to be mild for sensitive skin.The California Baby lotion was a HUGE disappointment. It is very watery and does not absorb at all. We tried leaving it on for a minute, but it did not get absorbed, and just stayed liquidy and wet, eventually it just got absorbed by their clothing. also, my little boy said it hurt his face. thinking it might be a fluke, we tried using it a couple other times -- same result, boy complained it hurt. Left my twins with very dry skin which is not surprising since it does not absorb well. Definitely will not purchase this one again."
1,1 CASSETTE!,"I received 1 cassette in a large box from Talus, not the 10pk listed for $19.99.Amazon asked if I wanted to re-order? Come on! I'd give it no stars for misleading ad."
1,Not a great read,"I can honestly say that this is the first book I ever read where I didn't like the main character. At all. In this book Tuffy came off as an ignorant brat who has no respect for authority and tries to be the boss of everything to make herself feel important.I will note that the first time I read this book I was probably about 16. I came across it in the school library and being the bookworm that I am, decided to try it. Had I been younger when I first stumbled upon it, I might have liked it better.However, I think most girl 8-12 will find it a good read."
4,Great for studying,I had a midterm on the book which I barely had time to read. These notes really helped me understand and visualize the impotant points of the book.
5,Best book on this topic,"I am an experienced IT professional and have gone through many books regarding ASP.NET. Man, I have become a fan of Mike Gunderloy after reading this book. This book is the best to teach you ASP.Net. Also, you can easily pass the exam after going through it. The style is superb and the way he has presented the material is by far excellent. I want to thank him for this effort. If you want to learn ASP.Net or pass 70-305, this is the book that you should buy. Normally, I resell the books after reading. But not this one, I will keep it with me, it is worth keeping.The only negative point of this book is that it has more than 1000 pages. But I think that was required to do justice with the topics. For people who are going for 70-305, I would suggest them to go through it carefully and I assure you that you do not need anything else except MSDN occasionally."
3,Cut and paste,"This book has quite a few examples. It's obvious that the author cut-and-pasted them, and no one checked 'em. I'd say 85% of the exercises work. Many are flawed by obvious typos, missing, or superflous code, such as declaring variables twice in different scopes. Overall, not a bad book, but not a great one. Ironically the 70-310 book by the same author and editor is much better, though it's a bit weak on ADO.Net."
5,Corky Siegel - Unrecognized genius of the harmonica,"I was surprised to find that outside of the midwest, a lot of folks have never heard of Corky Siegel (of the Siegel-Schwall Blues Band). That's a crime. Corky's one of the truly great masters of the blues harmonica.On this album, you'll hear him in a traditional blues context - where he excels - but if you really want to be blown away, check out his work on 'Street Music' with William Russo. Here's the link to the CD:Russo: Street Music; Gershwin: An American in Parisand it's available from Amazon as an MP3 download as well. Check out Corky's playing on ""Three Pieces for Blues Band & Symphony Orchestra""."
4,Perfect little treat,"I have three Guinea Pigs that are extremely hyper and active, all three of them together demolished this treat in four hours, they loved it!!"
3,Good potential but shallow and predictable,"The story had promise of being unique but I was too distracted by the superficial, idealistic portrayal of the main characters; just too perfect and stereotypical to be believed. Is there any one out there who could not have written the ending after about half way through this story?"
1,Don't bother,"I picked this up at a used book store. It sounded like it would be a good story but I just couldn't get into this book. The writing was very technical. Maybe a doctor would understand it, but I couldn't. The characters were dull & boring. I gave up on it after about 80 pages."
1,Horribly written,Being a fan of both medical and crime novels I thought the plot showed promise but the writer used such poor language and dialogue that I had to force myself to keep reading. Anyone with a ninth grade grasp of the English language will shutter. One of the worst books I have read in years.
3,False Hope,"That is the best way to describe this book. The plot was very promising, but the author did know how to write it. The plot is the reason the book got more than one star. The ending was very predictable and the characters were poorly formed. I only finished the book just to see if anything unexpected happened. It didn't."
1,Truly awful,"I love thrillers and read many. This was by far one of the worst. The writing itself was ok, but the plot was pretty much a joke from the very beginning. I read the whole thing, hoping it would get better, but it never did. Many of the things that occur in this book are so beyond the realm of possible or probable that I couldn't buy into it at all. It felt a lot like a romance written by a man who has no concept of what women think or want...combined with a medical thriller situated around a facility that could never, ever exist for so many logistical reasons that I don't care to type them all out. It just doesn't work. It is written as a present-day thriller set in the real world, but the plot lines are pure fantasy - and not interesting enough to make me want to ignore the impossibility of it all. I am not one to be very critical of my pleasure reading, but this truly stunk."
2,Don't bother,"These are tiny bags. You can fit chapstick, a couple of rocks or sea shells, but that's it. I would only use them as theme decor, not party favors. I was disappointed for $30!"
5,Excellent Read,This book is a wonderful resource and guide for my teens. They have read it and love it. I highly recommend it to those of you with children entering or already in high school!
4,What you sent for--AND A WHOLE LOT MORE!!!!!!!!!!!,"Seller of this book was CONFUSED- sent this, and another, entitled ""First Impression, Best Impression"" that we DID NOT ORDER,OR WANT, but got charged for anyway.""High School"" book is a good read,though- so don't judge a book BY ITS SELLER."
3,Too Much Minutae,"This work begins and ends essentially with the War of 1812.Adams describes various activities in excruciating detail.For example, when describing the preparations for a battle he providesthe number of men, regulars and militia; the names of their of divisionsand battalions; the number and size of cannon;the number, size and description of ships, etc.Most of this information is unnecessary to the average reader.If one is willing to advance rapidly through the minutae, there ismuch interesting, and well documented, information.It particularly outlines the political differences between the Northernand Southern states that began at the time that the Constitution was writtenand grew until the sides clashed during the Civil War.The Kindle version seems to have been copied from a copy that hadonce been owned by the Wellsely College Library.There are many typographic flaws."
2,Prefer something else.,"One thing I was not pleased with, was the fact that the pad is only 1 inch and claims to be 1.5 inches.I ordered the California king size and it doesn't even come close to fitting the bed.If you turn the pad it will be to short for the bed and hangs over the sides. The other direction makes it too long for the bed and too short for the sides.I don't know where they get the measurements for these pads but they don't even come close to fitting.It does make the bed a little softer but I would rather buy something else for $100 then spend it on this.I'm still just as sore in the morning as well."
3,Only for the seriously dedicated reader,"This book has a few gems of genius, but you have to be willing to slog through a lot of extremely dense writing to uncover them."
5,You know you've read a good book when...,"Possibly the greatest set of words to ever be written down in this order. With the exception of the recipe for chocolate chip cookies, but that goes without saying."
5,This is the greatest song ever made!,"Your song is off the chain! I love the song and would like to use it for my slow dance at my Sweet 16. I love this song and I love your music. You are the perfect artist. Your fine,you have a wonderful voice, and you know how to write a song that would make a women feel proud to be a women. I love you Jesse!"
5,Biophysics,This is a well written text book for students and researchers teaching basic concepts of biophysics. Especially biological membranes are dealed with comprehensively. The figures are easy to understand and the price is rather low. Actually it is the best book of this kind I encountered. It can be highly recommended.
3,Great Nostalgia. Questionable Album,"As an 18 year college DJ in the early 70s, I played this album (per request) to death. I wore out my personal copy in my dorm room. But...is it a classic, defining piece of rock? Does this album stand with Tommy, Sergeant Peppers, and The Dark Side of the Moon? I don't think so. Perhaps I'm jaded, but now much of this album sounds pretty silly (as does a lot of the music I proudly own from that era). 3 stars for the great memoriesIf you need details about the musicians, songs, and producer, read the other reviews: it's all covered quite well."
1,not ready for prime time,"Re: ""Spirit was formed with the intention to combine jazz, rock, classical, and folk with a mystical orientation."" Possibly, but I don't hear anything that sounds remotely like jazz or classical on this recording. (If folk is strumming chords on a steel string acoustic guitar, then I suppose there is a bit of folk.) What DO I hear? I hear a bar band that won't be asked back. This is my advice: If you decide to buy this in order to have NATURE'S WAY in your collection, tuck it away somewhere so you won't be embarrassed before visitors. Avoid even listening to anything on it except NATURE'S WAY. You'll only be depressed."
5,"""Twelve Dreams"" will take you to Cloud 9","""Twelve Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus"" is one of the great underrated classic rock albums, perhaps because it didn't contain a big hit single and the band that recorded it faded into obscurity in the years following its release. Perhaps the most successful fusion of jazz, rock and psychadelic music ever recorded (jeez, how many others have there been?), ""Twelve Dreams"" starts off with the excellent ""Nothing to Hide"" and never takes a false step. Though recorded in 1970, it was sonically so far ahead of its time that it sounds almost contemporary. Other first rate cuts include ""Morning Will Come,"" ""Animal Zoo,"" ""Mr. Skin"" and the fine folkie ""Nature's Way,"" which was later covered by Victoria Williams.I would give ""Twelve Dreams"" the nod over Spirit's ""Best Of"" album as a better purchase. It is more consistent for one thing, not to mention that half of the songs from the Best Of album are on it."
4,great stuff,"Just wanted to say that I saw Randy California and the drummer just prior to Randy's death. Contrary to what several other reviewers have said; the drummer was not his uncle, his stepfather... He was his ex-father-in-law!"
5,Amazing,"As I wrote in a review of the Family which plays together, I am not sure if this is better than the 2nd and 3rd albums, (The Family and Clear), I love this album and go around singing Nature's Way, Love has found a way, Animal Zoo and especially the very short, Why Can't I be free, which to me sums up the late 60s and 70s as well as any Dead song.They captured the spirit of the time so perfectly that I have never gotten tired of their best songs. I thought Clear was the perfect album with its wonderful instrumentals and since each song flows so perfectly into the next while some of the 12 Dreams don't fit in so perfectly but who cares?This is amazing music which you really have to have."
2,A disapointment!,"I read all the great reviews, I agree at least as far as the sound quality. Problem is whoever put it back together must not have been listening. None of the tracks run together like they did in the original LP. Even on the Best of Spirit CD Nature's Way flows into Animal Zoo w/o interuption but not here. That was one of the things I liked about the original LP. Oh well still better than singing it to myself."
5,An Unbelievable Masterpiece From Start to Finish!!!,"One of the great albums from the 60's, Spirit's The 12 Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus is a formidable look at the environment, hippy culture, and anything and everything else. I mean, Nature's Way is incredible and one of the best songs off the album, but try forgetting about Why Can't I be Free, Mr. Skin, etc. A true eclectic album, I recommend it to all fans of Phish, see this is eclecticism!!!"
5,Fourth time is the charm,This release is one to bring to that perverable desert island.One of rock music's shinning moments and the best album of 1970.
3,one you should have,"It is interesting to note the audio quality of the Spirit recordings. They were always a favorite with young audiophiles and college radio stations of the time. You'll note that I only gaveit 3 stars; I must say that is conservative, but, 4 and 5 stars are reserved for the truly memorable of the time. It was the pop hit ""I got a line on you"" that turned me on to them and as the band progressed through its short run in the sun, they gave reason to listen; ie, ""Natures Way"" and ""Mr. Skin"". I personally consider Mark Andes a strong player with this group; the solid foundation he put out held the rythmic interest for this listener. I had the opportunity to meet him while he was touring with Heart in 1983. They obviously knew his value as a foundation and I believe there were some recordings made durring his tenure."
5,It's your loss if you don't listen to 12 Dreams,"After you listened to 12 Dreams, start trying to find all the other albums, and enjoy."
3,Great Pictures,"Uses lots of nail transfers that I have not found locally (the author lists resources, but mostly in London.) Most designs are very easy to duplicate. Would have prefered buying just the book, without all the polish and extras."
3,Not original recordings,"It has been difficult to find Japanese wartime gunka music so I was excited to find this CD on Amazon. I was disappointed to discover upon listening that none of the songs are original recordings, instead being cover versions sounding like they were recorded in the 70's or 80's. If you are trying to find clean, well-recorded versions of these songs then this is an excellent selection. If, like me, you were looking for original songs you'll have to continue your hunt. Good luck!"
5,Alvin's Secret Code. Great book for 3rd - 6th grade.,When I read this book I was in 4th grade and carried it around for months until the cover wore off. I have had a love of codes and ciphers ever since. I'm reading it to my own kids now and they are just as thrilled as I was. It's a shame it's out of print.
4,Cute inexpensive toy,"When my son first saw a different brand of this item on television, he was impressed and wanted one. He was disappointed to find out that ""magic"" really means there's a string that you might not be able to see on TV, but should be able to see at home. Nevertheless, he was able to figure out all the tricks quickly, and the toy's motions were as fluid and controllable as expected.It does require a certain amount of dexterity and might be a problem for a young child. For an elementary school aged child, I'd say it would depend on the child. For older children, it should be simple to master.Despite that, it was easy to grow tired of fairly quickly, but my son is good at growing tired of one trick toys. For the price, I can't complain. I'd hate to pay what TV ads want for something similar, but it's well worth a few dollars."
4,Fun but string breaks pretty easily,It's fun but I actually don't think it's too good because our cat gets it sometimes and she pulls the string apart. I'm not saying that I don't like it; it's just that the cat always tries to break the string. (comments by my 6 year old son)
1,A Piece of Junk!,"This toy is a piece of junk and a waste of money. It did not come with any card containing an ""invisible"" string, nor a username that the website says it does. We bought it for Christmas for our kids and since none of them were able to play with it, it is going back to the store tomorrow! You are better off finding someone who has one so you can see in person how it works, what it looks like when it comes out of the package, and what you are supposed to do with it. There are no websites available that give you any of this information!"
2,"My grandson loved these, but they break so easily...","My five year old grandson absolutely loves these. I've reordered several times because he has such a good time with them. However, they rarely last the second session of play with him. Too much money to keep reordering these. Hopefully, someone will use the concept and make something a bit sturdier. They are listed as appropriate for a five year old!"
3,It's what you would expect.,"This toy is what you would expect: cheaply made, but can be fun. It's not for young kids since the invisible thread can easily tangle and would cause the toy to be useless in minutes. My 8 year old loves it, she thinks it's hilarious. We've had it for a day now and it hasn't tangled yet. Unfortunately this wiggly worm had a sticker for eyes which fell off within a couple hours. And you have to tie the thread to the nose of the worm yourself, which is a bit of a pain. We have another wiggly worm from a different manufacturer which had googly eyes and came with the thread already tied - MUCH better."
1,not worth to buy. horrible quality.,product is not durable. my son received it and the line broke in one day. the magic trick is hard to play. it is not a toy for kids.
5,Jaco is the Best,"This is an awesome CD for Jaco fans. If you play or love bass, it's a must have for your collection! This is according to Rich Fitkin, bass player, who I purchased the CD for."
4,heavy weather even heavier,"This album is worth owning on sacd just for the bass intro of birdland alone. Clear, tight and deeeeeeeeep bass like I've never heard on this album. However, I wish they had done a 5.1 mix. My previous set-up had two main speaker sets and pre-line out sub, so I really got the bass. Now that I've set up my speakers for a true 5.1 system, this stereo SACD lacks the bass impact of my previous set-up. I guess I need front speakers with a lower bottom end."
5,Excellent 1977 Jazz Perfection! Well Thought Out,"Weather Report were former musicians who played with Miles Davis.I find this Fusion Jazz Album very creative and innovative.From this listening to this cd, it sounds like they learned a lot from Miles It Combines electronic gadgets with traditional jazz instruments which blend into a relaxing and soothing sound. It contains the classic Birdland. I would recommend this album to anyone who appreciates good music."
2,Doesn't hold up,"I hadn't listened to this for years, but lately I've been getting out my old LP's and checking them out. I was surprised at how bland this recording is. ""Birdland"" is one perky tune, sure, but the rest sounds so generic. My wife said it reminded her of John Klemmer. The advent of Jaco Pastorius was the beginning of the end for this band. He was a truly gifted bassist, but his musical ideas were nothing more than run-of-the-mill. Once Wayne Shorter decided to spend the rest of his career coasting, Zawinul and Pastorius took the band into increasingly dull directions. ""Heavy Weather"" doesn't stand up over time."
2,Much rather listen to Miles or Coltrane,"I bought the album used after hearing that I might like Weather Report, and after listening I found out that I didn't like Weather Report much at all. While the album is pretty innovative for the times, the music just doesn't speak to me and sounds too electronic. There are some songs I like on this album, but also quite a few that I don't. While this album is somewhat decent, I'd much rather listen to many other artists for my jazz/fusion intake."
3,To Karrreoke or not to Kareoke,"For we Gringos, the ""Pistas"" or little parts albums are Latin music seies of recordings-minus-the vocals! They are intended for Kareoke use in bars or home entertainment. So if you are a big Kareoke guy, or like to sing along, this is your cup of tea. However, if you love Salsa get any of the various Puerto Rican Power cd's, they are a group right up their with Grupo Niche, Gran Combo of Puerto Rico, or Orquesta Guyacan."
3,In all honesty...,"This book, although informative, was very difficult to get through. I don't know, I just found it to be very dry. It's been a struggle to get through, but I think I will make it."
1,Contains DMDM!,"It says ""all natural spray"" but it contains DMDM.DMDM HYDANTOIN is an an antimicrobial formaldehyde releaser preservative.Formaldehyde is a carcinogenic impurity released by a number of cosmetic preservatives, including DMDM hydantoin.There is strong evidence that DMDM is a skin toxicant or allergen.(Source: [web: ewg])There is nothing ""natural"" about this product!"
4,Works Great!,"We use this product on our Springer Spaniel and it works great. No replacement for a regular bath, but certainly makes him more pleasant to be around after a fun day (for him) of exploring the woods around my workshop."
2,Cringe material,"I think the first disc is reasonably good. After seeing NIN live it is a nice momento.The second disc is great in parts but absolutely awful in parts - the worst being poor Trents howling in Something I can Never Have. Jeeeezzzz it makes my skin crawl...then theres The Fragile - argh! Shut up!The extortionate price is unjustifiable for this 'limited' edition, every music store I have walked into has this - not very limited except for poor wee Trents wailings on the 2nd disc. Perhaps they should give away some free tissues to weep at Trents misfortune at being able to sell this at this price.Seems kind of incredulous that record companies wonder why people burn CDs...glad I did.Oh well, at least Trent will never be able to bleat about commercialisation in the music industry. His greed equates him with The Spice Girls, Boyzone and other pre-fab grouips only into it for the money..."
2,Again?,"This consists of a 2 disk set. Disk 1 is live and no new ground is broken here. Trent has the unfortunate tendancy to record the same stuff over and over again. It may be live, it may be well-recorded, but you've heard all this before. Disk 2 is simply nothing special. Generally quiet, generally piano driven and gnerally boring. Anyone who collects all of NIN will want this to complete their collection but I predict that most people will listen to the studio albums and leave this on the shelf."
5,"if U are reading this, U must be interested so JUST BUY IT!!","This is GREAT live cd and the companion cd adds so much more to the old songs (particularly the becoming and the fragile). The new songs have a very nostalgic feeling to them... kinda sad (which is perfect). Just buy it, it's NIN and we know what reznor is capable of."
3,COLLECTORS BEWARE....,"If you have Halo 17 Part 1: ""All That Could Have Been: Live""and ""Halo 17 Part 2: ""All That Could Have Been: Still""Then you already own these discs... YOU DONT NEED THIS!If you have Halo 17 parts 1&2 as seperate releases you have all the tracks advertised here.I almost bought this thinking it was ""All That Could Have Been: Live"" with more ""LIVE"" tracks on a second disc - IT IS NOT!This is simply ""STILL"" and ""LIVE"" contained in one package.Not sure what the Halo is on this - Im a completist but Im not this desperate - its' like getting Survivalism Part 2 - pointless"
5,Solid release,"Run, don't walk, to the store and buy the special edition deluxe verison of this release. You will love everything about it, right down to the very packaging."
5,And All That Could Have Been,"How limited this is, I don't know, but, if you can get the limited edition, get it! It's soooooooooooooo great. The new songs are great. I'm listening to the song ""and all that could have been"" right now. It's the bestest new NIN cd since ""the fragile"" hehehe. Okay, I love NIN, and all their stuff is great. But, you gotta have this cd. Even if ""still"" the bounus cd, comes out later by itself, you should try and get the limited edition. It comes in a pretty case and everything. Okay, I'm rambiling right now... soooo get it. wow, I could be a sales person, pushy little me. :)"
5,The Best of Nine Inch Nails,"All that coulda been is truly titled correctly. This is by far my favorite album by them. No matter what the song, all the best songs by nine inch nails can be found on this album plus the still disc has the most emotional songs I have ever heard them do. This album will make you love nine Inch nails even more. This is a definitive album by them. I will always remember them by this album.-winston"
5,One of the best sounding Live CD's I have heard.,"""And All That Could Have Been"" is my first Nine Inch Nails disk I have ever bought, and it is worth every penny. I am now a fan, but might no buy the other releases that are out, because this is sort of like a greatest hits with a flawless live recording to it. Even though Trent Rezenor is really into self pity, (and thats one of my problems.) I have respect for the guy.To all the really big Nine Inch Nails fans. I strongly suggest you get the Deluxe Edition to this. The new and rare NIN tracks are good, and the packaging rules!"
5,"In a word, magnificent!","Okay, let's get the ugly truths out of the way first. The novel starts slow and almost has nothing to do with the rest of the book. The syntax is often screwy, with adverbs and advectives floating around awkwardly, not certain of which nouns to refer to. The ending is abrupt. Characters and details are elaborately introduced and then dropped.All that being said, what a great read! Beside wonderful set pieces like the Battle of Waterloo, there is an endlessly surprising and romantic plot hammered to reality with perceptive insights into personal and political motivation. The book is bursting with characters to take to the heart, some ""rounded"" like Gina and Count Mosca, some ""flatter"" like Fabrizio and Clelia, all vivid and unpredictable.This is not a neat, well-structured book. But if you need to satisfy an itch for a sweeping, sprawling, totally involving 19th Century epic, you've come to the right place."
3,Maybe it's the translation?,"It seems strange to be entering a rating for a novel so firmly entrenched as a classic. I really just came here looking for other readers' responses, because I have found this book, in the Everyman translation, so deadly dull that I have been using it as a soporific for over six months, and I'm still 100 pages from the end. The characters have never come to life for me; indeed the whole world of the novel seems very distant and thin. Therefore it's fascinating to read the reviews below. Am I missing some gene that makes it possible to enjoy this strange narrative?"
2,What Did I Miss?,"Wow - definitely a minority here since everyone else totally dug the book. Puzzling. I love historical fiction, especially about England or Italy. The description on the back was mouthwatering.It's certainly not the antiquated narrative tone - Oliver Twist, The Fifth Queen, Barnaby Rudge, Wives and Daughters (excellent!!), Dracula...no problem with any of them.I didn't finish the book - think it was around page 70 or so I decided to drop it. Couldn't tell you why. Just found it tedious and uninteresting. LOTS of description and long solid paragraphs maybe?"
1,please shoot me,"After reading The Red and the Black, also by Stendahl, I expected a fascinating read. Instead I'm resisting falling into a coma. This book is confusing, muddled and proves Nabokov right when he said Stendahl never wrote a good sentence. Very boring."
2,The Charterhouse of Parma,"A very old edition. Marked ""Not for resale"". But readable. If I had known the condition I would probably bought another offering. The price was good."
5,simply outstanding,"If you like a little New Orleans swing, this can't be beat. The first time I heard this was like these guys had a handle on my soul. As far as I know, you can't go wrong with Ruby."
3,Really More for the Hard-Core Fan Than the Average Reader,"Mark Twain's A Murder, A Mystery and a Marriage is a very minor work by the great author. The story -- written for Atlantic Monthly -- is slight enough that it can be read in sitting. There are some amusing points, but the plot is so transparent until the last chapter that it never really excited me. The last chapter is the story's villain's tacked-on explanation, and it comes completely out of left field. I actually found the foreword and afterword more interesting, as Roy Blount explains why the story was written and muses on how the politics of the day may have influenced Twain and his writing of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. This is a book for a true hard-core Twain fan who wants to read everything he ever wrote. Others probably should stick to his more major works. For more in-depth book reviews I've done, search for goldenrulecomics on Squidoo."
3,creative,"i listened to this on audio, so the narrator killed it a little bit for me. other than that, great story, very creative - a background on the story worth knowing. read the book, but also read where the idea for it came from."
2,goofy uninspired and uninspiring first-effort,"Skip this 'un and go directly to Fish Ain't Bitin', a vastly superior CD and some great acoustic blues. idon't know where his head was at with this one."
1,Doesn't taste good.,I don't know what I was thinking. The carrot powder looks yellowish. Probably all the beta carotene are all gone. I hoping to use them on my smoothies but it's has no taste to it. It looks and smells old. I can smell the plastic bag better than the carrot powder. No details if it's freeze dried or regular drying method. This would affect on what's left nutritionally.
2,Not that great,"The book is full of qualitative analysis. While this is great, I expected more equations and drills. If you are looking for technical analyses then do not buy this book"
4,Very enjoyable,"Somewhat out of date of course, but very detailed description and analysis. Nice addition to any fencing library. Great picture of the USN Academy fencing loft."
5,Who Doesn't Like Chaplin?,"Charlie Chaplin is so funny. I remember originally watching these movies when I was a kid on Saturday mornings. Now that I own the disk I can watch them whenever I want. The way that he can make me laugh with physical comedie is amazing. His timing is always perfect and the quality of these films is very high, considering they are from 1917. I also liked the music they choose to use with the shorts."
1,Not the CD featured in product description,"Firstly, this is not ""one star"" for Candie Payne, but rather one star for the fact that this is not the CD in the product description. The description gives the impression that the CD contains all (nearly) of the songs on her full-length CD with a bonus ""enhanced"" track. This CD contains the following: ""I wish I Could Have Loved You More"", ""That's All"", ""All I Need to Hear (acoustic version)"" and ""I wish I Could Have Loved You More (video)"". I love the tracks that I received, but wish the CD contained all the tracks listed in the description. I hope this review helps you avoid the same mistake I made. Peace"
2,Legendary CHinese Healing Herbs/Henry C. Lu,"If the index wasn't so horrible, this would be a great book. It is very difficult to find anything. It is not indexed (front or back) by plant names or latin names. No indexation for types of herbs, i.e. upper respiratory, etc. If you can wade through it and make notes on the inside back cover when you actually find something, it's informative."
2,buyer beware,"I used this guide for a trip to Barcelona, Granada and Alicante and found it to be so inconsistent that it was almost useless. Consequently, my friends and I nicknamed it ""Let's Lie.""Since each section is written by one writer/researcher, the quality and accuracy was very variable. One city might have useful information on lodging but be wildly inaccurate on restaurants or visa versa. For example, the hostel section in Granada was percectly fine, but all the info on neighborhood character and tourist sites was poorly researched, completely off-base and usually wrong. Addresses didn't exist, The Allhambra was actually open when the book said it would be closed and the ""hip young neighborhood with a gay scene"" was filled with fast food, families and churches."
2,Uninspiring,"I bought this cookbook because I liked the idea of having a week's worth of recipes. I was disappointed when it arrived because most of the menus seemed more like 'kiddie meals"" instead of family fare. Maybe I'm in the minority, but I don't usually eat chicken nuggets for dinner. Anyway, another complaint is that Brook Noel relies heavily on dijon mustard, which I like but don't usually use to the excess that she does. Her mainstay dish seems to be chicken spread with mustard, dipped in breadcrumbs, and then cooked in a skillet. This recipe appears several times in the cookbook under different names. She adds dijon mustard to just about any dish including pasta and sauces. My last complaint is that I often add a vegetable to her menus, since they are not always part of the meal. I think if you want to have dinner on the table quickly, the Rachael Ray books are better tasting, more wholesome, and a better buy for your money. Don't waste your time with this book."
2,My Least Favorite Penguin Book,"Being an avid penguin collector, I have many, many penguin books, but this is definitely my least favorite. The story is about a grown-up penguin telling a group of little penguins what will happen if they do things they shouldn't. In the meantime, one of the little penguins is doing all these things. Even though the story the Nanny penguin tells is supposed to be exciting, I found it a little on the boring side. I do like the pictures; they are bright and pleasant to look at. However, the rest of the story is, in my opinion, somewhat lacking. True, it does have a well-developed plot line, but it just did not seem very thrilling at all. Younger children might like it, say maybe through kindergarten, but the rest would probably not."
5,Essential Reading for Understanding Kerouac,Giamo's study is the best critical book on Kerouac I've read to date -- and I've read them all! Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in Jack Kerouac and the Beat Generation.
3,Buy his other book instead,"I bought this book with high hopes based on Rakoff's book Don't Get Too Comfortable, which was hilarious. This book was a letdown and too many of the chapters like the one about searching for the Loch Ness Monster or the teenage kibbutz story, seemed half-hearted at best and lacking in his usual flair for pithy observation and wit. I can highly recommned Don't Get Too Comfortable, but as for Fraud, well- it's aptly named."
2,David Sedaris Where are you?,"I hate to dissagree with those who've gone before me in writing these reviews but I was dissappointed in Fraud. Rather than being bitting, sharp and witty, I found it to be self indulgent to a point that I found myself wishing that the authors teacher in 3rd grade had sat him down and explained that 1. the world doesn't revolve around him and 2. false supreriority used as a defense mechanism might work in your own psyche but please down write it down and trick others into buying it by comparing it to David Sedaris.I haven't seen any book in which an author overestimates our interest in his angst since Brett Easton Ellis' Less than Zero. While I read Bretts books when they came out....the 80's are over, black turtlenecks are gone, Molly Ringwald is wallowing in obscurity, and the lead singer of the Cure has even cheered up a bit. Time for something new."
2,Just shows how great Sedaris really is...,"""Hmmm...National Public Radio commentator puts out book of 'humorist essays'. Sounds like David Sedaris. Knowing how much I enjoyed Naked, Me Talk Pretty One Day, and Barrel Fever, I shall give Mr. Rackoff a shot.""No, no, no. Not good. I feel sorry for David Rackoff. I mean, here's his good friend David Sedaris achieving cult status with these hilarious stories, and he probably said to himself, ""Why not? If he can do it, I can do it."" HE CAN'T DO IT. Unfortunately for David Rackoff, David Sedaris has raised the ""humorist essay"" bar too high. Nothing in Fraud comes close to Sedaris. Sedaris is the only author who has ever made me laugh out loud. Fraud didn't even force a giggle.Fraud definitely smacks of ""I think I can, I think I can"", and ends up offering nothing more than bland, uninteresting stories. If you want a few good essays, I suggest re-reading ""Me Talk Pretty One Day"". The experience will be far more satisfying than anything Fraud has to offer."
5,Amazingly Witty!,"I saw the author in question on ""The Daily Show"" with Jon Stewart and after wacthing this obvious nervous, sarcastic and almost manic writer, I decided I MUST have this book.This is the first book I have purchased in a long time which I enjoyed all the way through. It is sarcastic, sardonic, ironic, ridiculous and most importantly HILARIOUS. I adore this man's take on life. He has a touch of the Woody Allen nuerotic thing going on there but it's not self-depricating. His observations are wonderful and he has a style of writing that flows well and is an easy read.I can't WAIT to get my Audio CD version because somehow, hearing him re-live these ridiculous antics will be even better. I fear I may need oxygen after it from laughing so hard."
4,"An original voice, not a Sedaris wannabe","I have to confess that I have never heard even one episode of ""This American Life."" I was prompted to buy this title after reading of it in The Advocate. I'm glad that I did. Mr. Rakoff has a disarming style. His essays cover a variety of topics. Often humerous, Rakoff's stories are never as outrageous or as crude as those by Mr. Sedaris. I especially enjoyed his pieces ""The Best Medicine"" (which features one huge belly laugh) and ""I Used to Bank Here..."" ""Fraud"" is fresh, fun and always amusing."
1,very tired.,"If I had to sit through one more chapter, I would die an unhappy queen. I had very high hopes for this book and obviously it was a serious let down."
1,the worst bitchy queen you know and avoid,"I'm gay so I can say this, this guy is like the worst stereotype of a prissy arrogant condescending queen. If it wasn't written in 1st person I'd say the writer was homophobic. his obscure references and overly flowery language is either an attempt to make himself feel smarter or distractions to cover his weak storytelling. it reminds me of school reports that have to be a certain amount of words. he makes up adjectives by adding a y to nouns and verbs. One of the more cringe inducing phrases was ""instead of succumbing to the decapitory charms of the guillotine"". blech! very rarely am I annoyed enough to complain but this type of putting on airs (have I mentioned his frequent use of French ""sans"" translation?) trying to pass for good writing just burns me up!"
1,A Sorry Disappointment,"When this writer was compared to David Saderis, I expected the same witty, satire that I enjoyed with Barrel Fever/Holidays On Ice/Naked/I Talk Pretty One Day. They do have the same first name. That's where the similarity ends. Though Rakoff does give you good leads for stories, he weighs them down with his wordy descriptions of everything around him. He finds places to used fifty cent words that baffles the mind. I began to feel as if I were listening to a fiction novel with no plot. Eventually it became mindless babble. After listening to all four discs, I am sorry but he bored me."
3,Sessions of Valse with Readability,"I love books of essays. They're the fast food of reading. Wolf down one essay, and resume your quotidian toiling. In this realm, Rakoff's FRAUD is not freeze dried noodles in a broth of water and MSG, but it's not sirloin cheeseburger either. It's something in between. To be sure, I was not afflicted by a case of ""I can't put the book down"".This book is not an easy read by any standard. In terms of bombast and sesquipedalian delivery, Rakoff resides atop the food chain. But it's precisely the creative prose that kept me perusing these marginally compelling stories. It's somewhat unfortunate because it's should be about the tales, not the delivery. You might not need a dictionary to follow Rakoff along this labyrinth of expressive techniques, but you will require some reading double-takes to keep up. I recommend the book for adequate entertainment value and unique phraseology."
4,Byrds to Chill Out By,"I know this one didn't do very well in the charts, but this is a really great record. There is not one bad song in the bunch and the musicianship is fantastic. Put this album on after a long day at work, grab your drink, put your feet up, and enjoy."
2,mediocre at least!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this game say's mediocre all over it and say's bankrupted all over where should i start the grapics are o.k for this game but the sound is awfull and the gameplay and when i first bought this game i thought it will be like a need for speed underground game but noo!!! its like a street syndicate game that also is a mediocre so heres the reviewgraphics 4/10 its good for a game like thissound 3.5/10 just plain awfullgameplay 4.5/10 it sucks bad!!!!!!!overall 4.3/10 i think game woke up on the wrong side of the bed!!!!!!! i brought my game back to walmart!!!!
5,miracle cream,"I cannot tell you how much I love this! I am 26...almost 27 and I have fine lines, large pores, occasional acne and uneven skin tone and texture. I have heard that retinol is the miracle cure for all of the above but those I had tried dried my skin and made it red and flaky. This is perfection! I add a pea sized amount to my night cream regimen and I wake up with better skin! If I have an early morning gym session I don't even need to wash my face or use tinted moisturizer! My skin looks its best right as I wake up which I'm sure my husband loves. I have experienced no dryness or redness or side effects. I LOVE this product! I also love that it was MUCH cheaper on Amazon than at Sephora!"
3,"It works, but it breaks me out","I loved this- it seemed to add a bit of extra exfoliation to my skin without irritating it. And it smoothed out even the faint trace of lines I have around my under-35 eyes. My mom had a furrow between her brows which seemed permanent- but seriously, this product got rid of it! Amazing. However...sadly, this broke us both out within a couple of weeks of using it. My mom used it solely with Purity cleanser (which doesn't break her out), so no, it wasn't another product or a reaction of combining with something else. Such a shame, because it turns the clock back on your skin, and that is a RARE product which accomplishes said goal. The price of this is high, but for the results, it's worth it- if it doesn't bother your skin."
2,"Philosophy, help me love your ""Help Me"" retinol cream!","I so hoped this would be an effective cream for me, but it just hasn't been. I used it consistently for weeks according to the instructions, even using it twice a day when once a day wasn't helping. I just didn't see results, plain and simple. My fine lines and pores still appear as they did before. My skin doesn't really feel any smoother either. May'be I need something stronger?"
2,maria,"I have used this religiously for the past few weeks, and I don't see any difference. I got better results with the dermalogica overnight clearing gel. For what I paid for the ""help me"", I was expecting a lot more out of this product"
5,love it...,great for those who still suffer from acne and bad skin well into after their 20s. This product helps with breakouts as well as lines such as those laugh lines around the mouth. Always make sure to use w/ a moisturizer right after application has it seems to help the product along. And of course follow instructions on the sunscreen as well too when out during daylight after washing off.
5,"What is this ""acne"" you speak of?","Unbelievable. I've had pretty moderate acne since I was 12 years old (twenty years of fun!) and was using a prescription-level retinol that only really worked at certain times of the month, when my stress levels were low, when the moon was aligned with Venus, etc. So I decided to give Philosophy's Help Me a whirl after reading the reviews, and made myself use it for five or six weeks before writing my own review. So it's official: Any acne I once had is just plain GONE. I barely even wear makeup any more. There is simply no point. I can't really vouch for its line-reduction qualities as I didn't really have any to start with (one of the trade-offs of oily skin: stupid breakouts, but no wrinkles) but I did notice that I loved the way it made my skin feel: soft, smooth, and definitely youthful. If you're in your late twenties/early thirties and are still struggling with breakouts, I cannot recommend this stuff enough. It is miraculous."
4,Good so far...,"It usually takes about 6 to 8 weeks for a product like this to show signs of effectiveness and I haven't been using it for that long. But, it has seemed to clear up some roughness on my chin that exfoliators haven't cleared up."
3,it's okay...,"Been using for about a month. I have not seen a dramatic difference in my skin. It does cause some redness at times. My pore size has not changed at all. I don't have many wrinkles, but a few at age 32. It may have softened them a little but I cannot tell. I will finish this since it was so expensive and hope for the best. Probably will not purchase again! You led me wrong on this one, Dr. Oz!"
4,Not as great as On a Clear Day...but close,"This product replaced the now discontinued On a Clear Day retinol treatment, which I absolutely loved. I don't feel like this is as effective, but I think if I had tried this one first I would have loved it just as much. Clears up skin, prevents breakouts - my skin was noticeably softer and younger looking within a week. If you have sensitive skin, I'd definitely recommend using it VERY sparingly until your skin adjusts. I have very fair skin and it was only a bit irritated for about 3 days after first using. Now it's fine, but I do use moisturizer with sunscreen every morning too. A good alternative to On a Clear Day, but I'd still like to see that one come back. Worth the money."
2,Not worth the $,"I was willing to pay this much if the product did something fabulous for my skin. It did not. I've been using it every night with absolutely no results, except that I seem to be getting pimples from it. If you're looking for a dramatic change in your skin, keep looking."
5,Oh where have you been...,"I am always skeptical ordering products that I cannot sample or try before purchasing. I do not ever spend this amount of money on a product. However, when it was recommended to me to try a renitol product for my skin, I said I would give this a try. I am so glad I did. ""Help Me"" has been the answer that I have been looking for. It does absolutely everything that it says it will and then some. My skin is not perfect by any means, but it has not looked this good in a long time. The only caution I would say is that if you have dry skin, be sure to use a moisturizer with this product, other than that...Bravo Philosophy!"
4,It is a good gift to my friend,I buy it for my friend who is 25. I think she love it. And most people said it is good for the people between 25 to 30.
1,"Help yourself, don't buy this","If you already have access to Retin-A or Renova, skip this product.It's definitely a wanna-be.I got the set of cleanser/retinol/moisturizer, and took it all back. This was the ONLY item in the box that didn't have a nauseating smell.Try Anew Wrinkle Corrector instead, if you don't have access to prescription topicals. You'll get results and it costs less than this product."
2,bad rash,"i used this for the first time this week and have a really bad rash yesterday that is even worse today. i also bought the bliss mask. so, im still debating whether or not it is the help me or the bliss mask. my skin looks horrible! i did this of course the night before an important event and had to go with a rash. dont try this for the first time before something important. ive been taking benedryl and other allergy meds to keep me from scratching. may have to make a trip to the dermatologist's office now. i cant believe it's just gotten worse with time. ughhhh!"
3,I don't know if it's worth the $45,I heard that you can get something similar to this for a lot cheaper. Someone tell me where because I don't know if it was worth the money!
3,no fue el producto que me entregaron,"No se que problema, a mi no me entregaron este producto sino otro mas economico de las misma marca, pero para los ojos"
1,buddy love now on video,"I did not like this book at all. I didn't like the writing style, it took way way too long to say one thing. the entire book was very boring and it only had one interesting character, and it's not even Buddy! The ending is uninteresting and it left me wantto rewrite it. Buddy's character is way too dull. Maybe it's just me. I think late elementary or early middle school students might enjoy this book. If you are looking for a book with alot of action, don't even pick this one up!"
4,Original 80's Anime Series,"The good news is that this is a classic, original tale of four women who wear battlesuits and beat up on bad guys.The bad news is that, much like Shakespeare, there are a lot of cliches. In particular, the structure of the relationship between the girls and the VERY 80's pop-rock music drag a bit.If you are a true anime fan (and don't mind 80's pop) this is an excellent addition and a good value - especially given the historical context. If you are a casual browser, you might want to pick something more contemporary."
3,So-So Series - 3 and 1/2 stars,"The first ""Bubblegum Crisis"" series was one of the first Anime series that I saw. It was, and is, a great series that I would highly recommend to any Anime fan. This updated version of Bubblegum Crisis is pretty good, but I did'nt like the style of animation as much as the first series and it seems to be missing something. There is no ""oomph!"" that was evident in the first series; energy, engaging plot. And what is with the ""morphing battle suits""? I did like this volume more than the others, however, and the series ended on a high note."
3,Wonderfully adequate...,"I'd say almost borderline forgettable, if not for the cool 80's soundtrack. Don't get me wrong; I didn't find BGC appalling like I did ""Maze"", but nontheless, it really didn't do anything for me, and I certainly wish I could've gotten it cheaper. I found 2 problems with this series.#1. There was weak character development, and with all the jumping around that this series did, it made it hard to understand where the characters were coming from, lest your one of those who obsesses about that sort of thing, like the guy who suggested this to me.#2. It's too cliche! I mean, the robot battles looked like something I'd seen a million times before, whether in Transformers or Gundam Wing or Robotech.Don't get me wrong, I mean I did kind of enjoy it, but I'd suggest borrowing before buying. Actually, if you could get the soundtrack, I would recommend that, because I've heard almost nothing better in ANY movie/series/etc. Perfect for any die hard 80's fan."
4,Sweet,"This was one of the best Bubblegum Crisis episodes ever made, it is loaded with action and an extremely cool storyline about a group of robot suit warriors called the ""Knight Sabers"""
3,Eeesh....,"This series was pretty good. The animation isn't the greatest and it goes by a little slow for me and my brother, but over all not too bad. I wouldn't really recommend buying it unless you like classic anime."
3,A Good Start,"Great Animation, Great Music (especially the club scenes where Priss sings), and great Mecha suits. But I found the plot lacking. That's why I gave it a 3, but when I watched the next one I see that there is more to this than meets the eye. It's worth getting because you need the first movie in the series to understand the rest.2040: Megolithic Tokyo, seemingly run by a huge robot creation company. These robots, called ""boomers"", are basically polite slave labor. Used to do the dirty work (eg. Dishes, cunstruction, scribeing). But something can go wrong, these ""boomers"" can go insane.In come the ""Knight Sabers"", these Mecha-Clad babes fight the mad boomers. Useing high-tech weapons and armor to aid them. Priss, Linna, and Nene.. lead by the daughter of the man who invented these robots.There is more plot then first meets the eyes, buy this one and then get the rest."
2,Hopefully the next volumes are better,"Well what can I say, I found this volume boring and that it moved along very slowly. I still plan to view the next volumes but I was not impressed with this first volume. The whole time I was watching I kept thinking ""When will the episode(s) end,?"" and had ""so what"" thoughts to the plot as it went along. If you are easily entertained um, watch this. But I feel my 2 year old brother could start this anime off better."
1,"What's up with ""Bubble Gum Crisis""?","Why is it called Bubble Gum Crisis, I DON'T UNDERSTAND! It doesn't have anything to do with bubble gum so why is it called that? If any one could tell me that would be helpful."
4,washu_the_greatest,well it is not the best anime but the first set is cool i can't wait to get the second episode soon the music is great and for some people this will be great for an anime and it continues so you had to get the next one
2,Not good for scoped rifles,"I bought my Plano HS rifle case thinking it was as advertised great for a scoped rifle.Unfortunately, my Browning BAR Mark ll Safari 300 WSM with a Nikon Monarch Gold scope is just way too tight of a fit for it to be ""protective""...just the opposite. You have to struggle a bit to even get the zipper around and past the scope! A tight fit can cause the scope to be jarred and set off alignment, way too easily.This is poorly designed..an extra inch or so of room would make this a very doable and functional case.The carry strap is flimsy and simply not padded enough. Once again, a dollar more worth of material and padding on the sling would make this a higher class and grade of case for carrying a $1,800 rifle and scope around.Want to buy mine? It is pretty useless to me as a rifle not correctly and always sighted in is a worse thing."
2,Last week 4 stars this week 2,"last week when I bought this at a local retailer for way less than on the internet I was thrilled cause it was cool. Now that I have played a few movies I know why it is cheap(I think) it has the older style read laser which does try very hard to read dvd-r disks however, sometimes it just can't. Out of the 5 movies I have tried to watch 3 of which were store bought it played only one all the way through. Superman. It would not even recognize Highlander the ultimate edition. The ones I tried that were on dvd-r would get about 10 min in and you would think it had paused but then after 2-3 min the movie would start again. I tried all these disks out in another dvd and they played fine. so watch what you buy. Make sure you can take it back. Cause that's where I am going today. ( but I could have gotten a dud you never know):0)"
2,Save your money and don't buy this CD.,"Redd Foxx's stuff on this CD may have been funny in the 50's but it is lukewarm in this day and time; especially when it's compared to his recent work such as, ""Redd Foxx in a Plain Brown Wrapper."" I was sorely dissappointed in this CD."
4,Quiet strength,Alan Ladd exhibits his usual quiet strength in a classic western full of action and as usual a classic western lesson of life.
4,The Fifth Whispering Smith Film,"The film staring Alan Ladd is the fifth, and the best, based on Spearman's novel of that name. His book was was the best-selling novel of 1906 and remained popular for many years. Holywood could not ignore a great story with such an engaging title and the 1st silent film was made in 1916. Spearman's original character was based on several railroad detectives and the nickname belonged to one...James L. Smith. Regretably, the real detective was nothing like Spearman's fictional character. His actual nature is recounted in my ""Whispering Smith: His Life and Misadventures."" Spearman's book and the film (DVD) continueto be popular with viewers and readers although the story is now over one hundred years old."
5,Whispering Smith,"I saw both of these as a young man. What was important was the condition of the DVD and package when they were received, and they were in supurb condition."
2,Slanted and missing a key...,"I bought the Zippy Elegant Ergo Curve while searching for a keyboard with low-profile keys to reduce stress. I was disappointed by three things:1. The curve is uncomfortable. I've used curved ergo keyboards, which granted, take time to get used to, but I never did with this one.2. I use keyboard shortcuts a lot that require the Ctrl, Alt, and Shift keys. There is no Ctrl key to the right of the spacebar, which makes many commands two-handed, defeating the ""shortcut"" part. Don't use keyboard shortcuts? This won't affect you.3. While plugged into my USB hub (which is how I wanted it, since this was for a laptop), this keyboard is always on the fritz. The Num Lock, Caps Lock, and Scroll Lock lights blink and often there is a pause between the typing and when it shows on screen. However, having said that, it works fine when plugged directly into the computer."
1,Formula change...sad for my cat,"I had fed this food to my cat for three years. No treats only this food and he loved it. In May kibble changed and so did formula and he did not want to eat it. Called company and they said only shape changed. Within three weeks of feeding this food he developed crystals in his urine, was at the vet for 5 days, tried another special vet food but he never recovered and we had to euthanize him in July"
2,Nearly killed the cats,"Too much of a good thing? We worked this kibble in over time, slowly shifting the percentage of Felidae to national junk-food brand until the bowl was all natural. By this time, the cats couldn't keep it in or down. What a mess. We've moved on."
5,Five Star Review,"This book has all the elements I enjoy in a story. There is suspense until the final pages, romance, believable characters and settings. You get involved in it and hope the ending is one that is satisfying. It was! A great book."
2,Poor direction,"I was very excited to get this DVD to use for a Shakespeare class I teach. It is difficult to find a production of Othello that is not rated R because so many directors focus on the sex between Othello and Desdemona to engage audiences. So I was hoping to see a version that focused more on Iago's evil manipulative schemes. However, I was quite disappointed by the performances, which were either too subtle or too over the top throughout. Ian McKellen's performance was lacking, but I feel that is due in part to the awful direction by Trevor Nunn. Othello is one of the most gripping stories as we are exposed to the depth of love, hate, jealously and fear that we all carry within us, yet this particular production was so immensly boring. I will not use it again to teach Othello in my classroom."
5,EXCELLENT!!!,"Living on some of the turf fought over in the Civil War doesn't make one a history expert, but I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I gave my dad a HUGE set of CW reference books for Christmas; now I need to go borrow them to flesh out the real story. Aside from that, the suspense was quite engaging, and I spent some late nights reading. It appears that these books may be out of print, which is a true shame."
1,Not much here for the straight female,"This tape has a fairly wide range of scenarios, but few really seem oriented toward straight women. The entire first half was pretty much a waste. I'm very disappointed."
1,Looks better than it sounds.,"Reading other reviews and noting that the editor was a woman, I had assumed that this CD would be focused towards arousing women. This is not the case. It is obviously aimed at the stereotypical male who enjoys large breasts... period. Don't purchase this CD believing that your girlfriend or wife will enjoy it. The chances of that are very slim.Also, there is not one track dipicting a heterosexual committed couple."
1,This CD is amazingly lacking in creativity and erotica.,"I bought this CD because I saw a mention of it in Laura Corn's book ""101 Nights Og Great Sex."" The impression I got from the book and the online reviews was that it would be an extremely erotic experience. Don't waste your money! There is nothing special about this nonsense. Quite honestly, I feel as though I wasted my money. There is so much more that they could have done that would have been genuinely exciting, but this CD falls short miserably. Not one of the 15 tracks on the CD was enough to create any sexual tension. Shop around, I am sure there is much more out there available that can get a rise out of you."
4,pretty good piece of work,"Some of the tracks sounded a bit contrived to me. ""Kissing"" sounds came across as fake. But all-in-all, worth the price. It was worth it just for track 13. THAT seemed real. Lisa Palac could make a whole new CD with just track 13 types recordings on it."
4,A Great book in an unfortunate edition,"This book is a 500-odd page abridgement of Macaulay's magisterial History of England. T.B. Macaulay is one of the supreme victorian stylist, if not unquestionably the greatest. He is also one of the forefathers of modern liberalism. The prose is brilliant, and Macaulay has bettered his master, Scott, in his renderings of a bygone era. That much being said, we deplore the need to abridge this masterpiece. Five volumes might sound daunting, but Macaulay is entertaining enough to sustain our interest throughout the length of the book. The abridgements are so extensive that the introduction is reduced to 3 pages, and the recreation of the reign of King Charles II is entirely lost. Buy this book by all means, but if you can find the full version, give that a try. A wonderful companion to this book is Hume's History of England."
4,English History-Lite and Tory-free,"First off, I don't fancy abridged editions of anything, particularly history. But, as my current budget couldn't quite stomach the cost of the full five volumes, I settled on this edition.This reservation having been asseverated, this is as fine an abridged edition of Macaulay's History as one is likely to find. Trevor-Roper does a splendid job of pointing out the prejudicial and less than honest accounts associated with Macaulay's unforgiving Whig triumphalism, and the book does, as has been mentioned by the other reviewers, read quite well. One only regrets the truncations and what not associated with the abridged version.Try Hume if you fancy a well-written history from the other side of the political spectrum-Also, Churchill's History of The English Speaking Peoples."
5,You don't have it yet?,"Well, Headhunter is one of the first album of Jazz-Funk.And it is also one of the best, it can bee listening by all the people.Chameleon is my favourite, cause this tune mix many things of different music, and it is Funky!But it is very looked for, very morked, it is not simply a Funktune.Watermelon man, the best known Hancock's theme, is really good.Summers recreate the song of Africa with a bootle of Beer!Well, when I heard it for the first time in 2000, i said ""this is a new CD"", but i rode that it made in 1973!The sound looks new, and it is one of the Music album that every good Jazz listener got to hear..."
5,NOTHING LIKE IT BEFORE OR AFTER,"I was a big afro'ed 13 year old kid in high school ( 1973 ) listening to all of the 'hot' radio stuff when some wild, always blitzed-out dude named Danny Andrews wandered late into art class and handed me a cassette: ""Hey man, get over all that Jackson 5 stuff and check this out!"" Well for starters the cover of the LP was weird enough, but when I heard the first thumpin' INSANELY funky MELODIC bass lines of Chameleon ""boam boam boam boam BOAM BOAM..."" I was hooked. That song in and of itself can take you on a sonic journey and flip you around! The coolest part is when the song turns into a straight ahead jazz jam then freaks back out into the funk space thing....unreal. The rest of the album is also unreal - this album seriously changed my life for the better and I always come back to this album/cd for a mental refresher. There is simply nothing else to compare this record to..."
4,IT'S BEEN WELL OVER THIRTY YEARS AND I,"I HAVE HAD IT SINCE IT CAME OUT IN 1973, AND ITS' STILL AS GOOD TODAY AS IT WAS BACK THEN. WOW THERE ARE CERTAINLY ARE A LOT OF REVIEWS WRITTEN ABOUT THIS RECORD.IT IS HARD TO DESCRIBE THIS ALBUM, IT'S NOT QUITE JAZZ, IT'S NOT QUITE ""FUNK"", IT'S NOT QUITE ""FUSION"" MUSIC, IT STANDS ON ITS' OWN AS SOMETHING ELSE. KIND OF A COMBINATION OF ALL THREE. AT THE TIME, KEYBOARD INNOVATIONS WERE REALLY COMING INTO VOGUE AND HERBIE REALLY KNEW HOW TO EXPLOIT IT ON THIS ALBUM. BETTER THAN HIS LATER ELECTRONIC STUFF, WHICH WAS A LOT MORE COMMERCIAL. OTHER CONTEMPORARIES FROM THIS TIME INCLUDE CHICK COREA, JAN HAMMER, GEORGE DUKE, AND TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, STEVIE WONDER."
4,Herbie Does the Funk,"This CD will sound a bit dated at times, like you're listening to a 1960's Mod Squad sound track. But if you like your jazz with a dash of laid back funk, then you'll enjoy this CD."
5,"A suberb album, maybe the godfather of funk","I wasn`t even born when this album came out yet I can see how important it really is. Herbie Hancock new that he had to change, like every great jazz musician. Yet Herbie seemed to stretch futher than most. It seemed to go as far away from jazz as possible whilst keeping in its boundries. With the percussion of Bill Summers added to the band it brought a fresh taste of african styles to the songs, most notably in `Watermelon man` the rythmic aspect of this song is outstanding as much is the whole album. This album really is a milestone in jazz, and quite rightly so."
5,"To the management/ This is not a review, It is a comment",The album cover depicting Head Hunters is the wrong cover
4,Just A Bit Overrated,"For a jazz snob trying to dip into fusion,you reallycan't go wrong with this because cuts like ""Sly"" and the closing""Vein Melter"" feature enough improvising to please such a listener.The meat of this is the 15 minute+ jam ""Chameleon"",withit's signiture,much-sampled opening synth-riffs and it'srelentless funk beat.Things get even heavier with a modernizedtake on the Hancock classic ""Watermelon Man"",whitch is not onlyunrecognizable from the original but has far more afro-funkand catchy pop overtones.Bottom line:side 1 is an introductionto Herbie's funk world that is classic and cannot be ignored,butseries funk-jazz fans will be a tad bewildered by the morederivitive B-side.Put into perspective,an overall classic in thewide spectrum of music but it starts out as funk-jazz and movesinto jazz-funk.Funk fans will enjoy themselfs more consistantlywith albums like ""Thrust"",Man-Child"" and even ""Magic Windows""."
5,"Amazing, innovative. Still shocks after 30 years","When I was ten years old in 1986 I bought a Philips sound system. The first vinyl record I heard on it was Head Hunter, which I had borrowed on the library. Today 16 years later it's still rank up high on my list. I must have listened to this record hundreds of times, but it still hits me everytime.The sound is fresh. Herbie's lyrical Rhodes playing and the lovely old synthesizers and the bands incredible tight grooves makes it a masterpiece. If you like ol' skool funk music or all the house music playing today this record is a must have. Herbie rules forever!"
5,and in the beginning there was acid jazz,"This is where it all began. If you're into acid jazz and/or trip hop, this is your first stop."
3,Funk Brilliance,"I love Herbie Hancock's jazz material, so I tend to like the 60s Hancock, the Miles period, his work with VSOP, and some of his more recent material which I feel is a return to form.Funk is not up there on my favourites, but its not a personal hate either. As far as an example of classic 70s funk jazz then this album has got to be a defining moment, along with Herbie's related work,Thrust.Not much else to add, I'm sure Funk lovers will give this one a higher rating. Its a fun purchase to have, a little dated to my ear, but an important piece of its time. Many good moments on it to be had, and if you dig funk more than me than this should be a great album for you.Hard to recommend, yet hard not to either"
4,Best of the best?,"Definitely it's a very good album you should listen to!Herbie Hancock on the keys, and you in the audience makes it a nice afternoon!"
4,Great but a little overrated,"The opening lines of both Chameleon and Watermelon Man are great, and have been very influential ever since they were released.A lot has been written of the new concept that this album brought forth and of its influence on music in general. While this is all true, I must add my personal impression, that the improvisations on these and the remaining tracks, mostly by Harbie Hancock playing the electric keyboard (Clavinet) - are not always interesting, and sometimes last a little longer than is musically justified. I think the music would have gained if the improvisations were shorter and the emphasis on rhythmic funk lines was even stronger.I believe this is a must for all music enthusiasts, despite what I consider its flaws."
5,A must-have classic,"I had this on vinyl years ago and am glad to have the CD. This music still resonates. Go, Herbie!"
5,Great Product & Great Coaching Tool,The product is well made and is an excellent training tool. I use the poles for agility training and also for dribbling drills. The kids really enjoy them. I have never been disspointed with a product from Kwik Goal.
5,solid,"You can't beat the price of these sticks. I searched around for cheaper ones because it seems so expensive to buy PVC and metal spikes, but the competition had plastic on the bottom and surely would not have held up. My rugby coach used them for the first time last night. With the added cross bars from the same company they were great for hurdles and when set higher,for bars to duck under. These sticks will no doubt last many seasons."
3,US Stabling Guide,"I have not read this book as of yet, because I am just now ordering it. I am hoping that it will have all of the information that I need. The reason that I am ordering this book as opposed to others that I have checked out is the price.I hope that it will be satisfying and I will let you know what I think after I have had a chance to read it.Tammy"
5,Stunning,"As many times as I have listened to her sister Dannii's album ""Neon Nights."" I can't find myself getting into it as much as Kylie's ""Fever."" Kylie is obviously one of the greatest female artists ever. She has made one of the best dance albums ever. It is sensual, relaxing, fun, and just so damn good. The production flows perfectly with her angelic vocals.Best Songs: Love at first sight, Can't get you out my head, Fever, Fragile, Come into my World, Dancefloor, and Burning Up."
3,Sexy style taken down a notch with filler,"I was saddened to hear of her illness, but she'll be okay. If only I could perform a surgical extraction on some of the tracks on this cd it would get a grand 5-stars. I love the artwork - so sexy. It reminds me of album artwork of late 70's disco albums. Mmmmm, yessss. There are brilliant tracks here. Working with the genius Cathy Dennis (in spite of the American Idol theme) is the best thing Kylie's done. Cathy, why aren't you working MORE, baby? The first 3 tracks make my system BUMP like you wouldn't believe, as well as ""Come Into My World"", which has an amazing vidclip by Gondry. Kylie, get well soon - and give Cathy a call when you're ready to move it again..."
3,Light Years Away....,"Light Years is without a doubt one of thr BEST CDs in my collection, so topping it would be pretty tough. I only really enjoyed about 5 of the tracks on this CD. Fever (the single) is probably the most enjoyable track in the CD, with a funky, sexy beat. Most of the others seemed like the same old club re-hash. Overall I just got a mild Fever from this CD"
5,What r u waiting for?! Buy it!!,I was not a fan of Kylie before i picked up this album on an impulse but now i am definitely a huge fan of hers. Absolutely FANTASTIC! Enough said.
5,Over a year with Fever and still loving it!,"I got this when it was released back in Feb 2002 and I loved it then! It's a great album with a great dance feel. It's disco/dance/pop it's an album that you would dance into the night with songs like ""more..."" and ""love at first sight.""This is an album that I put in when I'm in a bad mood, I listen to it and life seems lighter and better! I love this album and I guarentee that you will too!"
5,Eurotrash Pop at its best,"When I first heard CGYOOMH, I instantly loved it. For me the surprise is that it's playing on US radio. Bought the album, love every song, which is rare. While Madonna delivers product with more depth, the only albums she has that I like this consistently are greatest hits sets. ""Fever"" may have less lyrical substance (though it has enough for me), but stylistically, it is one absolutely fabulous ensemble. I'll still be surprised if any other singles make it in the states. The general taste here is...different (although the club scene is sure to wear this set out). I just know that I'll be listening to this one for quite some time."
1,Quite unthoughtful,"I purchased a copy of this album after a suggestion from a friend.....a few hours later in ended up in the bin.....very dissapointing, bland and not to mention boring and derivative (some people from New York would understand what I mean). In summary....not only does kylie mingogue (I wont grace her name with capitals) fall flat on cd....she also cannot perform live and rely's on ""gay camp it up"" imagery to hide behind (a very cheap and politically incorrect exploit). A very bad performer and a shameful album."
1,What a horrible album!,"""can't get you out of my head"" is without a doubt, one of the most annoying songs I've ever heard. Kylie Minogue is way too old to be a pop star, and someone should tell her to coverup!"
2,Awful,"Like many fools out there, I purchased this albim for the two singles, 'Can't Get You Out of My Head, and 'Love At First Sight.' Unfortunately, those are the only good tracks. I just burned those two songs onto a mini disc so I could listen to the only good songs on FEVER without the excess garbage."
3,Kylie's first sight...,"This review is kinda late but I thought I'd write one for Kylie. Not really a big follower of this Aussie wench, but on the other hand, I owned this album not too long ago, and I say that it's good for a diva who doesn't know how to sing and I'm serious. The tunes are meant for tripping singer and it well suited her style and voice. No offense meant but Dannii (although not a great singer as well) is miles away when it comes to singing. ""Fever"", ""Love At First Sight"", ""Come Into My World"" and ""In Your Eyes"" are the best tracks off the album. Great forgettable disco dishes! Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston would laugh, Tina Arena would knod her head. Cheers!"
4,RESURGENCE,MOST OF THE SONGS HAVE THE SAME CLUB BEAT AND DANCEFLOOR AND A COUPLE OF THE OTHERS ARE WORTH BUYING THE ALBUM FOR GREAT DANCE MUSIC AT PARTIES AND DJ'S ...FOR WEDDINGS. GOOD JOB KYLIE
3,Decent dance album,"The popular track from this recording, ""can't get you out of my head"" is slightly more edgy and adventurous than the rest of this very likable dance album. Every song is a throbbing dance number, with rather trite lyrics. The album is completely ballad-free, just as it is free of any real instruments: all instrumentation is synthasized, as is Ms. Minogues voice on some tracks. Unlike most popular dance CD's, the level of the songs is very consistent, with only one or two 'fillers'. Other songs on the album, such as ""fragile"" and ""come into my world"" are very infectuous. A very good effort for a dance recording."
4,"Feel-good, Cruisin' Music","I never heard of Kylie until the Sydney 2000 closing ceremonies. Then, when ""Fever"" was released in the US, I decided to take a chance on it.I'm glad I did! Great stuff to listen to. Every track a catchy tune that sounds great if you're dancing, driving, working out, or need cheering up.You might call this ""fluff,"" but sometimes you need fluff to remind you that music can be fun, and not always heavy with an ""I hate life"" theme. Call this a guilty pleasure, then, because I've yet to get tired of this album.By the way, I'm glad I bought this *before* Kylie's previous (import-only) album, ""Light Years."" It compares to ""Fever"" like night to day. The tracks on ""Light Years"" are just... stupid. They're totally vapid and acoustically painful. If you buy ""Fever"" first, you won't enjoy ""Light Years."" Trust me!"
5,The Ultimate Dance Diva...Kylie Minogue!,"I'm a trance lover. I'm not saying Kylie is a trance singer, but you can dance to her songs. I'm not playin! Since 'can get you out of my head' and 'love at first sight' were featured on dance formats radio stations all across the world, I decided to buy the CD. I didn't regret buying it. This CD keeps an upbeat mood in me. Most likly in you also! There is NOT one song that puts you to sleep. So buy this CD! Okay? Okay."
4,Kylie Fever - Sealed with a kiss!,"Fever, Fever in the morning, fever all through the night...Kylie's fans would hum their way with this release of 'Fever' and she's proved to shine out all through the days when she sang with Jason Donovan 'Sealed with a kiss'. Kylie & jason's video n audio tapes are jes great and I knew this sweet girl would make up 'Big' someday. Her 'Locomotion' song was cool stuff and here with a Bang is on my top pop list 'Fever' with my hot fav 'Can't get out of my head'. More, more, more is a wonderful dance track to sway around with 'Fever' the funky song to pick one high and a gr8 europop of all time. Kylie Minogue is sure pick if the choice is a mix dance n ballad style. One thing is amazing of Kylie's videos is that she looks bubbling, fresh n oh so charming that one couldnt stop listening to her songs. Her songs are always great to listen, any place, any time. A cool Pick, thats Kylie Minogue, My choice for sure."
3,Not bad...some songs are better than others,"This CD has several catchy and energetic songs than can be played over and over again, such as Love at First Sight. Still, most of the other songs are pretty annoying and not very original. It is not a bad CD, and it depends on your personal taste, but in my opinion most of the songs give you a headache."
2,Major disappointment,"I was looking forward to purchasing this album after everything I heard on TV. But to my greatest disappointment the album is far from being even very good. There are just a couple of songs (like ""can't get you out of my head"" and ""in your eyes"" that I can replay on a daily basis... Looks like this CD will collect dust in the CD box."
1,A real no talent!,What is all the fuss about? Vocals are weak and as far as her videos go she dances so stiff it is laughable. Pop music has become a game of videos with flashing lights and sexy back up dancers and weak singing all aimed at preteens spending their allowances on the flavour of the week. This time next month people will be saying Kylie who?
1,can't wait 'til the fever breaks,"this is one of the most annoying cd's i've ever been forced to listen to (by a cheesy disco-loving spouse). normally i love dance music but ""fever"" just leaves me cold. i guess the music is catchy in a poppy, bouncing up and down, shake your booty kind of way, but i can't get past the unbelievably insipid lyrics. it's as if she took a book of song cliches and randomly pulled phrases out of it. the only saving grace is that kylie is so obviously a one hit wonder and she will soon retreat to the other side of the pacific, never to be heard from again."
1,"Fluffy, Poppy, souless garbage...","That pretty much sums this album up. There's not enough to it to warrant many more words. Any guy who listens to this album (unless forced to by an extremely attractive female) should have his ""dude"" license revoked."
1,Kylie's most overrated CD.,"I really couldn't understand what all the fuss was about this album, it wasn't spectacular, although its leaps and bounds above anything of what's on her current album.Like kylie it is medicore and fluffy. If that's the stuff you like, it's right up your street, however for those of that like a bit of substance and some emotion and intelligence expressed in songs you should really try and avoid this."
5,Can't get these songs outta my head !,"Although I have listened to a lot of songs of Kylie before this album released, such as Confide in Me, Some Kind Of Bliss, Locomotion, and Spinning Around and even liked them, I never considered buying any of her albums then. Then, one day, I finally bought her new album ""Fever"" and I LOVED listening to all the tracks in the album!!The album starts off with the groovy disco track ""More More More"", and continues with inspiring dico tracks such as ""Can't Get You Out Of My Head"" ( which was the only single to hit #1 in the U.S charts! ), ""Fever"" ( kinda slow but very catchy ), ""In Your Eyes"", ""Dancefloor"", ""Fragile"", and ""Come Into My World"".All in all, whether you are a Kylie fan or not, if you like listening to pop or disco songs, then listen to this album and you will be singing the songs for months!"
5,Kylie Fever,"I luv her CD... All da songs have a beat and thats da best thing about her. Every song (including slow songs) have a beat. Also does anyone no what CD I have. It includes the normal songs but also has Boy and Butterfly. All I can say is, after hearing TWO singles, you'll get Kylie Fever for sure!"
3,It's in your eyes....Pop diva finally makes it stateside,"Many counties have their own. Own Madonna. Sweden has popdiva Lena Philipsson. England has all the Spice Girls. USA has Britney Spears and Jennifer Lopez. Australia have the might Kylie. She has been a superstars for years all around the world, excpet in the states. But she had some trouble years. But Ex popdiva Paula Abdul change that, with helping Kylie back on track with UK nr1 hit ""Spinning Around"" from last album ""Light Years"". But it was with the grovvy ""Can't Get You Out Of My Head"" she showed us, she can be a light version of Madonna. But she has her own style, more popdance and disco. It feels very european. Highlight on the album is the great floorfiller ""It's In Your Eyes"", ""Love At First Site"" and ""Burning Up"".If you like Kylie, check out the new European superstar Sophie Ellis Bexter.So get your dance shoes on, sip up the drink and get on the dance floor! Becourse - Kylie is in town!"
3,The Dance Diva Strikes Again,"Great CD featuring many listenable tracks including the worldwide smash ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"", the great ballad ""Your Love"" and the disco anthem ""Burning Up"". Not everything works, though. ""Dancefloor"" is just boring while ""Come Into My World"" sounds too much like Donna Summer's ""Could It Be Magic"". It's too bad that the B-sides ""Tightrope"" and ""Never Spoken"" weren't included on this album...would've made it much better. This US edition features two ""hidden"" gems...the dance smash ""Butterfly"" and the funky ""Boy""."
3,Good Clean Fun,"It's about time the TRL audience started to get into the more electro-derived pop that Kylie gives in this, her eighth album, I think. Though the lyrics are pretty vacant and the album has no real staying power (it's really good at first, by slowly declines; after less than a year you'll probably be ready to part with this one) most of the music is very good. This album is a good idea of the best work we can ever hope to get out of mindless TRL..."
4,Lalalalalalala!,Kylie's Fever album is what I call a good pop album. It isn't about anything special or isn't in it self to be taken very seriously but that is exactly what I love about it. It doesn't take on any issue it doesn't contain any weak points like wining or crying. It isn't trying to be anything that it isn't. Kylie and her people managed to create a really good album that is listenable all the way through and is good to dance to in parties and dances. Kylie doesn't have a special talent but that doesn't mean that this album isn't good and Kylie isn't being anyone she's not. That's what I like about her and That's what I like about her album.
5,disco-pop FEVER,"This is definitely a great album. Although the first song ""More More More"" is a SORE disappointment(kinda sloppy, I think), the rest of them are just FEVERISH!! The video of ""Come into my world"" is really original and really well-made. My personal favourites in this album were:1. In your eyes.2. Come into my world3. love at first sightI guess music does not get better than this!"
4,Can't get you out of my radio. 'Cause this album is great.,"I think that this album was one of the best releases of 2002. The second single ""Can't get you out of my head"" had been heard around the world topping almost every charting list.Besides the success, the album is great great, it's a great dance album and Kylie's voice is perfect for this kind of music.There are 3 more hit singles of this album which are: ""Come into my world"", ""In your eyes"" and my personal favorite ""Love at first sight"".The album debuted in the Billboard 200 at #3 and has been certified Platinum in the U.s.I can't compare this album with another 'cause is unique."
4,More pop genius from the Pop Princess,"Her 2nd best album in my opinion, sounds a bit cold on first listen, but is filled with great singles and great fillers.From the classic Cant Get You Out of My Head, to Love at First Sight, the great Come Into My World and the even better dance single In Your Eyes.This album has a couple of gorgeous pop ballads, especially Fragile, which is kylie at her best.A great album, but consider the double cd version available on import - with the additional remixes (notably Cant Get Blue Monday Out of My Head, and the Fischerspooner remix of Come Into My World) and a passable new song (originally on the Scooby Doo Soundtrack).The only track missing, is 'Tightrope' which was released on the international versions of this edition - its perhaps Kylies best song ever, and a crime it was missed off here.Not camp like Light Years, this is more mainstream, appealing more to the general populous rather than girls and gay guys (like its predecessor)."
4,Thank goodness the girl made it to America!!,My daughter and I can't stop dancing to this album. I was nervous at first because I usually don't buy an album after hearing one song. Let's just say this is a sure fire party album to make you shake the blues away. Hats off to the producers.Harlem is bumpin tonight with this album.I look forward to more on this artist.
5,Great eighth studio album,"I am a big fan of Kylie. I own eight of her nine studio albums, five of her DVD's and six other albums including two greatest hits packages plus four books. This album clearly stands out. It may not be as good as Light Years, but it is certainly a keeper!More More More: Great song. 5 Stars.Love At First Sight: Great song. 5 Stars. (Single: #2)Can't Get Out Of My Head: Great song. 5 Stars. (Single: #1)Fever: Title track. A great effort. 5 Stars.Give It To Me: Great song. Too short. 4 Stars.Fragile: Lovely ballad. 5 Stars.Come Into My World: Great song. 5 Stars. (Single: #8)In Your Eyes: Excellent! 5 Stars. (Single: #3)Dance Floor: Great! 2nd best. 6 Stars.Love Affair: Some thing's in the air! 5 Stars.Your Love: BEST! 7 Stars. Should have been a single.Burning Up: Nice song to round off album. 5 Stars.Simple as that."
3,. . . .she's something else.,"I'm not even going to lie to you. I bought the album because i've always thought that Kylie is one of the finest women walking on the planet. And listening to the album for the first time left a little to be desired. However, upon more recent spins of the disc, my conclusion has changed from indifference to a recomendation. To me, the album isn't the greatest dance album there is. But the single 'Can't Get You Out Of My Head' does nothing short of bump. Kylies lyrics have become more introspective while maintaining a pretty consitent level of musical production. I think its a keeper."
3,Good dance recording,"After Kylie had proved everyone she could make interesting music in 1997, she went back to what her fans wanted: generic pop music. Which is fine also since she's good at doing that. 'Light Years' was a bit uneven but this one is a bit more creative and fun as a whole. The beats are better and this time around things dance a lot more. First of all, there's no ballad, which is a great way to make a dance record. Second, a few songs in here are truly landmark dance numbers: Can't Get You Out of My Head, Love Affair, Come To My World but mostly the amazing In Your Eyes. Burning Up is also a top-notch affair, being the most innovative track on the album. Some songs should have been left out (as they add nothing but filling) but that's to be expected from such a commercial release. Still a huge step over most candy-pop acts of today."
3,I Lost Interest in Fever cd,"The only tracks that stand out on Fever are ""Love at First Sight,"" ""Can't Get You Out of My Head,"" ""Come Into My World,"" and ""In Your Eyes."" At first, I really liked this cd. However, after I listened to this album several times, I was sick of the music."
4,STILL BURNING WIT FEVER,"FIRST TIME I HEARD ""CANT GET U OUTTA MY HEAD"" I FEEL OUTTA MY CHAIR. I WAS LIKE, MAN THIS IS HOT. I WAS ONE OF THE FEW AMERICANS WHO STILL KNEW MS. MINOGUE STILL EXISTED OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. I WAS VERY EXCITED TO HEAR THAT THIS DISC WOULD SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY IN THE STATES EVEN AFTER ""SPINNNING AROUND"" FROM THE LIGHT YEARS DISC WAS SHUNNED HERE. ANYWAY, THE DISC HAS SOME GREAT DANCE TRACKS ON IT. LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT IS MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE ON THE DISC. ""BOY"" IS A HOT TRACK AS WELL AS ""BURNING UP"". THE ONLY SONG I SKIP IS ""GIVE IT TO ME"". I WAS ALSO SHOCKED TO LEARN THAT CATHY DENNIS CO-WROTE 2 A FEW TRACKS (OUTTA MY HEAD AND COME INTO MY WORLD, WHICH IS A GREAT TRACK.)SHE WILL NEVER GET THE ICON STATUS LIKE MADONNA BUT YOU HAVE TO GIVE THE GIRL HER PROPS SHE HAS SOLD OVER 30MIL RECORDS WITHOUT MUCH HELP FROM AMERICA. BUY THIS ALBUM!!!"
5,excellent dance album,"just a quick review... this is a great album! nearly all the songs are catchy and dont get old, in fact they grow on you... the quality of the mixes are excellent as well. its a good buy if you like dance/pop.-L8"
3,Only two good songs.,"I bought this for ""Can't get you out of my Head"" and ""Come into my World"" which I love but the first song ""More, more, more is really boring horrible pop of the commercial machiene variety.I got the version with the bonus disc and the bonus disc is great, better than the albumn.It is great dance music and great get your body moving music for doing house work or exercise too.I was hopeing the other songs were as good as Can't get you out of my head and Come in to this world but unfortunately some of them most of them aren't as good. However the CD grows on me all the time. ..."
5,there are only 5 stars? no 10?,"First of all Kylie Minogue deserves a 10 for this album...too bad there was only a five...i want to start out by saying that this has got to be one of the best albums released this year! It's one of those cd's that is good from begining to end...no skipping tracks...like one review said ""no red lights (ballads)"" this cd is all around dance/club/disco. and its not a bunch of ""cant get you out of my head"" repeat and remakes..each track is unique. Kylie is looking better than ever and this is a cd you have to get! MY favorites (wel they're all my favorites) are 'more more more' 'CGYOOMY' 'fever' 'give it to me' the bonus track ""boy"" and the song ""burning up"" which starts out like a nice ballad..then suprises you with the pounding bass...""I'm burning up baby i'm burning up"" Get this cd...!"
5,Queen Of The Dancefloor...,"that's exactly what Kylie is now.Fever is the first Kylie album I got and I think it's a fabulous album with fabulous songs.I merely bought it out of my adoration for the lead single,Can't Get You Out Of My Head.But i soon grew to enjoy my personal faves,More MOre More,Fever,Fragile and Burning Up.Whenever I feel like dancing for a while,I have absolutely no hesitation to give this CD a spin and head on down to the dancefloor. Ironically, there's a track on this CD titled Dacefloor. This album certainly cements Kylie's status as Queen Of The Dancefloor!"
3,Pretty Good,"I had never heard one of Kylie's albums before this one, but I was pleasantly surprised. This is a good pop record with some really catchy songs. The only song I don't like is ""Give It To Me"", which is just filler in my opinion. The 2 bonus tracks are good, especially ""Boy"", however, ""Butterfly"" doens't really fit in with the rest of the songs as it is more of a hardcore club song, which sounds like a remix. I understand it's from one of her past albums. It's still good though. Anyway, I give this album a solid B+"
4,"For the remixes, Miss Minogue!","The album is simply a reedition of her highly successful album Fever. It contains a bonus disc with all of her best remixes of her last singles. The US mix of the Love At First Sight song is incredibly catchy, it's actually the songs that's been played on the radio last summer. Moreover, the remix of her current hit Comme into my world captures the essence of her video for the same song.The special edition is strategy from the labels in order to gain sales during the lucrative Christmas period, but for any pop fans, it's a good way to sweeten your grey november days ."
5,ABSOLUTELY AMAZING,For people who like pop music this is absolutely great. It's even better for fans of dance music. This is the best dance album since Madonna's Music. You cannot go wrong buying this CD if you like to party.
4,great to dance to,"What I love about this cd is that every song is upbeat. If I feel like dancing this is what I listen to. My only problem with it is the songs with sexual conotations. To me, that's [needless]. It makes me think of singers like Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera and I hate them."
2,"Catchy, but Monotonoous","The last I had heard from Kylie Minogue was her 1988 remake of Little Eva's ""The Locomotion."" Liking that one song, I bought her US debut album ""Kylie,"" and was disappointed to find that ""locomotion"" was the only decent song on there.Now, 13 years later, it seems that Ms. Minogue has done it again. The song ""Can't Get You Out of my Head"" is the best one on the album...all of the other tracks are relatively dull, (although, I must admit, they are catchy.) What bugged me was how all of the songs sound so much alike that it became difficult to differentiate them from one-another.If you like ""Can't Get You Out of My Head,"" then purchase the single; unless you like monotony, don't buy the album."
2,Kylie's Album,"I don't think that this is the best album that she has done. But, I think as her next single, she should put out the songFraglie. That song is cool on her new album. I hope that it gets out as a single on the radio someday. Plus if any of Kylie fans are looking for a new pen pal, you can write to me. Thanks!"
2,Not As Good as Her Geffen Efforts,"I am one of the few diehard U.S. fans of Kylie who bought and loved her two Geffen records; both are upbeat pop music at its finest, with lyrics of some depth. I was really looking forward to this new record, but am very disappointed. I knew to expect a dance record, rather than pop, but lyrically, these songs are weak, and the melodies and dance beats of many of the songs are indistinguishable. The first single is great, but it is definitely the album's only high point."
2,Kyile's New Album!,I don't think that this is her best album over the years.Her best songs I think are Especially For You and songs in the past.But I still listen to all her albums anyways even the new one since I am fan of hers.
1,cold disco,cheeky and cheesy disco-popmeant to sound sexy and fullbut actually sounds hollow and colddisco in a can: ...shaken not stirred
5,Fevermania!,"Fever was one of the best pop dance disco of the past year and in a while. Kylie took her time to emerge victorious with Light Years in 2000 but even then that record cannot match the panche of this album! Containing the right grooves and enough hi enegry tailored for the dancefloor, this is dance pop at its very best!The revised version appends a second CD of remixes to the original which also has a newly recorded version of Come Into My World, the curent single. While this is admittedly a cash-milking exercise, it is a good one for the bonus CD is really worth the price of the 2CDs. There's the trance club mix of In our Eyes by the famous Roger Sanchez, the excellent Scrumfrog and Fischerspooner remixes for Love AT First Sight and Come Into My World respectively and the Blue Monday-infused mix of Can't Get You Out Of My Head which has now become a classic.Get this before it runs out in stores!"
4,Great dance album!,"Kylie's FEVER has remained as one of my favorite dance albums. The songs are infectuous and have me singing along and dancing. From the first single ""Can't Get You Out Of My Head"" (which you couldn't if you tried) to the bubbly and energetic title track, there's dance written all over this fine album. My only complaint is near the end there are some songs that aren't as strong, like ""Dancefloor"", ""Your Love"" and ""Love Affair"", but the rest of the tracks are fab! The ballad ""Fragile"" is one of her best. ""Love At First Sight"" is another classic that has a catchy chorus that stays in your head. Other highlights include ""Burning Up"", ""Give It To Me"" and ""In Your Eyes"". A great album from Kylie!"
5,Fun and Lively Dance Music!!!,"This is a great CD. Kylie has a unique voice and a good ear for a hook. It's about time someone made some good club music! Jennifer Lopez wishes she could sound this good and self-assured. Kylie's the real deal--no remixes needed here. No lip synching, either. If you like good dance music, and catchy hooks, you'll love this CD. Welcome back, Kylie--stay awhile why dontcha!"
2,School Rumble..English Sub T__T,"If you are a big fan on cutesy Japanese Anime, then you will definitely love School Rumble for a kick off. However, i say that, after having watched the Japanese version. I didn't think they could ruin another anime with english dubs, oh how very wrong was i. This is just one of the classic examples where dubbed versions, just suck. The American humor does not meet the same requirements as that of the Japanese, so your better off sticking with subtitles."
4,positive,"My order was received on time and packed very neatly in one piece.Will continue to buy from this company. But, I do have a question, why was the product I purchased had one price advertised but when I viewed their web site the same product was advertised at a lower price??????.Thank you.Positive"
3,Modesty Blaise,I do like this film. BUT! The dvd extras of Tarintino & the Director and the other 3 extras on the comic strip art and Peter O'Donnellare NOT on this version of this DVD. For that you must buy the Brown/montage Modesty Blaise film.
4,At last - Although not quite there yet,"At last somebody who actually cares about the series made a film of it. My only criticism is that it was a bit too low budget. Ms Staden was excellent as Modesty, though I agree that she is going to have to work out a bit if she is going to play the older Blaise in a later film.One point about the secret agent issue: I suggest that some people read/reread the books. It is very clear that Modesty worked with (although not ""for"" as she herself underlines on a couple of occasions ) British Intelligence more than once. Indeed two of her closest friends are senior intelligence officers - remember the name Sir Gerald Tarrant anyone?"
2,"Misleading Case, Not a Bad Movie....","As previous reviewers point out, the DVD case is completely misleading. Whoever designed the front cover and wrote the back copy clearly had never seen the movie.* There are no car chases in this movie* ""most lethal secret agent""?!? (She's not a secret agent)* ""sexy spy"" (She's not a spy.)* ""revenge ... payback..."" (C'mon ... the women is trying to get out of a hostage situation ...)In addition to...* While the female lead had her moments, she looks anorexic (not very attractive). There are SO many beautiful women out there ... where do they producer/directors find these boney women?!?* The overall acting is stilted at times.If you can get past the lies on the front cover and the low budget production feel, this movie provides a fairly good story.I'd give it a higher rating, but the unethical false advertising of the cover is something I find very disturbing."
3,Good but not very hot,I just bought it 2 days back for my mom..yet to give it to her..so cant add her feedback but I tried it on myself the day i bought..and wasnt really totally satisfied..it wasnt heating enough..even at the highest setting..wont say it was lukewarm..it was definitely better than that..but i felt it wasn't enough to provide relief to a bad pain...
3,Good...but bulky control and stiff cable,"I'd give this product 3 1/2 stars if half stars were possible. It seems well-constructed and -- most of all -- delivers plenty of heat. I had almost been too discouraged to try another heating pad, believing that the lawyers and assorted consumer nannies no longer allowed heating pads to heat. Not true with this one.OTOH, I consider the bulky control and the stiff cable to be substantial drawbacks to this product. The control is the size of a largish TV remote, the kind that fills a man's hand. Maybe this is necessary to accommodate the ""computer control."" (What'd you think...they had a little three-position switch?) Even worse than the bulk of the control is the stiffness of the cable from the control to the pad. This is not a subtle point...we are talking seriously stiff here. The pad is awkward to maneuver with all of this hardware hanging off of it."
1,Shouldn't a heating pad heat up?,"This pad barely got warm. It's going back! Since this is the same complaint as with another Sunbeam model I tried, I suspect it isn't defective but intentional... probably for legal reasons. But shouldn't a heating pad actually have some heat to it??"
1,Bad,"Horrible. It didnt even heat up on the highest setting. I'm returning it today actually, and when I opened the package there was a scratch on the controller as though it was defective, and someone returned it already after trying it.. and then it was just resold.Dont get it."
4,I'm on my 2nd one and it's pretty good,"I'm on my 2nd Sunbeam heating pad and I'm pretty satisfied so far. The 1st one I had for years. BTW,I bought them both from Walgreen's. I use it every single day & I feel like I got my money's worth. They're not that expensive & the settings are great - I just wish the cord was'nt so bulky. Do they make cordless heating pads? That would be awesome. With an option to go cordless or vice versa.Sunbeam Health at Home King Size Heating Pad with HeatSense Technology, Grey"
2,JW,"I would have rated it five star, except the control was made overly complicated. I think ten settings for heat and then many settings for how many hours two, four, six hours or continuous on---WHY make it so diffcult to operate. And the instuctions, goodness, almost useless!"
5,Greatest Heating Pad EVER,"I've probably tried at least 5-6 other pads before getting this one. My search is finally over. This one gets VERY hot, and eases my back cramps. It's soft and big, and conforms to your body. I bought a second one, in case mine breaks or they stop making it.Love it."
1,2 tries and it barely heats...,"How bad can things get? I ordered this mid-December; when it arrived, I found that it didn't heat up beyond a super-low setting -- even on High, it was barely warm. I called Sunbeam, and they said the control was defective and they'd send a replacement the following day. The replacement arrived on February 6th! I plugged it in and guess what? It was even more useless than the other! Some people on here have good functioning pads, so I suspect there are a number of bad ones, or they've been reconditioned or returned and Sunbeam is just playing Russian Roulette with the orders. I had a similar Sunbeam pad for years and I loved it -- it died after much use and I was trying to replace a really great heating pad. I'm really sick of this!"
1,UGH - what a waste,"I bought this heating pad with the thought in mind that it was large and would cover a sore shoulder. It has worked for 6 months now, but has started to shut itself off every time I plug it in. The light blinks as if it has been on too long right after I plug it into the wall. This is very frustrating, and I cannot return it.Save your money and do not buy this heating pad."
1,Flawed in many ways,"The power cord pulling out is quite irritating, as is the loud controller...but the final straw was when I started getting ""F1"" and ""F2"" errors after about 10 uses. The pad refuses to heat up at all now. Sunbeam sure has gone downhill."
4,Product lasted less than 30 days but Amazon replaced quickly,"I was very excited about this heating pad. When it arrived, I was impressed with the controls and the heating capability of the pad. Unfortunately, within 25 days, the control no longer functioned. I was so disappointed. I have never had to return anything to Amazon before; however, I was very impressed with their tremendous customer service. The agent sent me a prepaid return label via email to mail the defective pad back. And, I received my replacement heating pad within three days from my call. Hopefully, this second pad will perform as admirably as the first...hope it lasts longer than 25 days though. Probably just got a bad one the first time...it happens. If not, I'll post my experience."
5,Great heating pad at great price!,"My husband and I both have shoulder and lower back problems. We use our Sunbeam heating pads every day. Since the features have already been well reviewed, I'll just add that we find them to be very easy to use and reliable. Previously, we owned four TheraTherm heating pads that cost WAY more than the Sunbeam ones, but they each lasted about a year and then were done, and we didn't even use them on an every day basis like we do the Sunbeam ones. The only suggestion I would have for Sunbeam is to make them a bit thicker, as they feel kind of flimsy, even though they aren't. They are well made, but I just like a more substantial feel, plus this would make them softer and stay on the shoulders a bit easier. I'd buy them again."
4,does a nice job,received it in good order - quite consistent in its behavior - good for heating up the back of my neck.
5,If Only I'd Ordered It Myself From Amazon...,"I've had a Sunbeam heating pad for over 20 years, right now it's still working, but it's over a tablecloth but under a small wool throw, on top of my parakeet's cage. He's 12 years old and we live in a COLD climate during the winter. I finally decided to get another one for myself, but now I've got to share it with my Dachshund, she loves it too. I bought it on Ebay but it arrived from Amazon as a gift from the seller on Ebay, five dollars more than what the price was on Amazon!"
2,lead content,This produst appears to be an excellent heating pad until the box is opened. It is only then that the lead content in the wiring is discovered with a warning to wash one's hands after using. Quite an inconvenience if one requires the use of this product! The warning should have been offering in the blurb on Amazon!
3,It Works,It was a gift. The person likes it and has used it three times with great success. What more might be said?
1,luke warm pad at best,once again a heating pad that doesnt heat!!!! the box says the most advanced heating pad....i laugh in the face of anyone who thinks this is a great heating pad....
4,Great Heating Pad,"Contrary to other reviews I've read, this Pad is the best I've ever owned! Others claim it doesn't get hot enough....mine does. The extra long cord is a first even though it is stiff and hard to control. Would recommend this pad to everyone."
1,Not good,It was not very big to be a king size heating pad but the worst part was that there was a short in the on and off button and it only worked for a few day then I couldn't get it to turn on anymore. I would not recommend it.
1,"Sunbeam Health at Home 809-015, King Size 14"" x 18"" - does not get very hot","Sunbeam Health at Home 809-015, King Size 14"" x 18""I read several reviews before purchasing this but some people said it was hot enough and others said that it was not so I took my chances. I was disappointed. The heating pad I currently own is not hot enough and this one was even less hot on the highest setting. I returned it."
3,"SUNBEAM HEALTH AT HOME HEATING PAD, KING SIZE","I like the fact that I could turn this heating pad on for as long as I want. I do not have to wake up every 1-2 hours at night to turn the heating pad on. But I am TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED about WARRANTY PERIOD. It is printed on the box as LIMITED LIFETIME WARRANTY. But inside box on instruction sheet,it states only ""ONE YEAR"" for warranty. I feel cheated."
2,Several problems,"I agree with those who say this pad doesn't get hot enough. Maybe some people's do, and maybe some others just like the pad cooler. But on the highest setting, I don't think this got as hot as the low setting on my 30-year-old pad.In addition:1. It has a digital display with no backlight. You have to have the light on to see to set it.2. Only the quilted part heats up, and that's about the size of a standard pad. The borders don't heat.There were a few things I did like:1. Long cord.2. Washability.3. The cover doesn't slip off.Nevertheless, I want a heating pad that heats. I'm sending this one back."
2,Not hot enough,"I decided to buy this heating pad on the strength of a number of good reviews, and although I had noticed that there were some people saying they felt that the pad's highest setting didn't produce enough heat, others said that it was ""really hot."" Anyway, my pad certainly doesn't get NEARLY as hot as I'd expect it to. It's very disappointing, actually. I don't know if it's a defect, or if there are variations between individual items in this regard, but it's hard for me to imagine how anyone could possibly say that MY pad gets ""really hot."" I'd describe it more as ""luke-warm""--and that's at the HIGHEST setting."
3,Could be better,The control on this heating pad is difficult to use but the pad itself works well. I think I will stick with just on and off and temp settings after this one!
3,Nice.,"The product is nice. It is well made. The control features are excellent. The digital screen is back lit. The cord is long enough to reach from the outlet to the opposite side of a queen bed. My only complaint it that it doesn't get really hot. It gets warm enough for comfort, but if you are used to an eighties or earlier heating pad you won't find something that hot. Final review: Good for comfort, not for therapy. Still worth the money for me."
3,I expected better,"I paid a little more to get this pad because it stated "" Extra soft, integrated pad conforms to body"". The FIRST thing I noticed taking it out of the box was the lack of padding. You can feel the wiring in this unit more than any other I have owned. The other features like temperature control are about the same as what you'd get with any other pad only with a fancier controller. So it is just as stiff ,maybe a little stiffer, less padding, comparable heat control,and size to my last heating pad but for a few dollars more. I should have just gotten the large one they has at Target for less, same company. Oh, this does have straps on it so I figure it will be good for the car (with a converter) since I have chronic pain I need something to go with me and this can hook on the seat. I'll try and find a bigger one with padding for home use. Still depend on the cherry seed neck pillow for my neck pain though since it conforms to my neck."
4,Handy,Just the right size for an everyday pocket knife. Quality material and craftmanship. The clip makes it handy to have in your pocket with out it getting stuck inside.
4,Less Well Known Album Released on January 3rd 1968.,"Dr Byrds And Mr Hyde delivered a harder rock sound, although still influenced by country music.Some of it does not work for me, for example Old Blue, Medley: My Back Pages/ BJ Blues/ Baby What You Want Me to Do and Bad Night At The Whiskey.This Wheel's On Fire is an excellent Bob Dylan cover and I enjoy Your Gentle Way Of Loving Me, the instrumental Nashville West, Child Of The Universe and Candy.Drug Store Truck Driving Man is a humorous dig at a local disc jocky who refused to play their records !Of the bonus tracks only Lay Lady Lay, a slowish version of the Bob Dylan classic, really adds to the original LP.So there it is, by no means their best, but with enough to earn 4 stars."
4,Break out the tissues,"Okay, maybe I'm just a little emotional today but I just watched the movie and I have to tell you, I have a headache from trying NOT to cry harder than I was! The movie does have some slow points but they aren't senseless. In fact most help add to the emotional quality of the movie. The only part of the movie that brings the viewer back to the fact that this is only movie is he ending minutes. but I won't spoil any moments. As for the boy robot, I don't believe that there could have been a better actor cast for the lead part than Haley Joel Osment. He practically dares the audience not to feel his pain and feeling of mis' (misunderstand, misdirection, etc.). In my opinion, this movie is worth the time and money."
4,really fun,Its a fun way to let someone know all different types of stuff about you. Plus you can do it as an activity together =)
4,great self discovery book,"This book is great for anyone wanting to know more about themselves, to help learn more about someone special to you, or as something to fill in for your spouse/children to read in the future. There are many different topics to fill in and write your memories as well as questions that spur your thinking about where you are now and what you want in the future. I am happy I took the time to do this before I had children and look forward to sharing it with my spouse and children in the future."
3,Just Ok,"This book was fun to fill out, but it did not reveal anything extraordinary. I meant to complete it and give it as a gift to my boyfriend, but I don't think I will. Most the questions are shallow and the result can look narcissistic. I should have seen it coming though."
4,Great for parties,I bought this book and filled it out for me... but then brought it out one night when some friends of mine were over... we sat there for hours... great way to get people to learn about each other.
1,One Liner Format is Limiting,"Bought this book for my father. Unfortunately, I found that the yes/no, multiple choice and one liner records to pointed questions subdued his responses and creativity.Some of the questions are clever ones that I wouldn't have thought of (e.g. ""If you had to imagine your father as an animal, he would be..."").The one line response format wasn't open-ended or expansive enough for him to tell the stories he wanted to tell, and that I wanted to hear/preserve."
5,The Best Gift Idea...,"Ever struggle to figure out what to get for someone who has everything? Then this gift is perfect. The entire book is fill-in-the-blank or check-the-box to answer autobiographical questions. Too often we pass through life without reflection--this book makes you think about who you are, what you want out of life, and who the really important people are and the impact they have made on your life. This gift if perfect for any holiday, birthday, or just for fun. Everyone should have one!"
3,It's ok,"The book is ok. I thought it would be bigger and that it would ask really in-depth questions. Don't get me wrong, some questions may be a little personal, but overall, it's not what I expected. I'm only half way through, so hopefully I change my mind by the time I reach the end."
4,"Good questions, but otherwise boring","The book posed some interesting questions, but was pretty boring on the inside. No room for pictures or drawings...no colors. It simply asked questions and gave lines to write on."
4,Very Useful and Fun!,This book was fun to fill out and I realized that you can fill out a new one every few years once your opinions and feelings have changed! I think this would be a great book for any teenager or twenty-something struggling with identity issues!
4,It's an adventure on getting to know yourself...,"I enjoy this book because you get to discover things about yourself that you may not have realized. It's also good because you want to keep it forever and review it months or even years later to see how/if you have changed. It's a journey to self-discovery. I'm reluctant to fill in all the blanks in case it gets into the wrong hands...but one day I'll just do it and whoever reads it will have to realize I was simply going on how I was feeling at that particular time in my life. ;-)I bought the book for my closet friends and for a couple who have been married for 20 years;I bought them ""All About Us"". I cant wait to hear what they have to say. LOL. ;-)"
4,Redonerulz,"My husband and I both have completed this book and then we swapped, It was like we were dating all over again. It is a beautiful thing to learn things you never knew about your loved one."
1,no for everyone,I bought this intending to give it to older friends of mine so they chould fill it out for there kids and grand kids. But there are a LOT of sexual questions in there and things NO ONE needs to know about u.
4,Not bad.,"It's a nice gift to give for people who enjoy documenting small details about themselves for comedic or future reference. I bought it for myself just for fun and enjoyed it, though it could have been improved. There's a a couple of questions that seem to repeat or are just sort of ""out there"". Definitely not bad though."
5,Learning about Me,"The All About Me book was and is a great gift to have and give. You as the author of you life knows you the best, but with this book you are 'forced' to answer questions about yourself that you would otherwise never think of. This book is a great way to learn more about and be more in tune with yourself and how you think."
4,Perfect for Introspective Analysis,"This book lets you reflect back and also look forward. It uncovers hidden truths you may not have currently given attention. If you want to know more about yourself or share yourself with someone else, this is the perfect avenue. I recommend you buy two and fill them out with your significant other. Or save one and fill it out later and see how things have changed."
2,Lacking,"This is a nice.. beginner journal about the self. It would also make a wonderful present for a teenager or someone who may want a more sillier type of question. It has quite a few questions that are one line answers, and questions to me that don't really seem all that interesting or needed for a true ""About My Life"" journal fanatic. Silly questions are the ""How do you put the toliet paper on"" type of questions. It may be a cute gift or research method if your starting to get serious in a relationship and you want to find out some facts about someone. However, if your looking for a journal that you want to be able to fill out, and pass down to generations to get a real sense of who you are, you should look elsewhere."
2,Some are unuseable,"I bought a dozen to check them out before I bought a bucket. 3 out of my dozen were so poorly covered that the leather was bubbling and loose, maybe I can use these for soft toss. The rest are OK, the leather is real but the seams are very erratic. these ball will be good for infield outfield practice but I will try and find a better ball for BP and pitching practice."
4,Great Quality and Price!,"My Little LEague team loves these baseballs. They look, feel, and perform as necessary for my team of 7-9 yr-olds. Great price!"
2,You get what you pay for,The price is right but the quality of the balls isn't great. Next time i would opt for a more expensive one ...
5,practice balls AAAAA++++,"You want real leather balls for BP, fielding, pitching and everything except real games, these are great and cheap!!1"
4,Good Quality - so far,I've been using these baseballs for batting cage practice for about a month for a minors LL team. They seem to be holding up well and good quality. The balls do have PRACTICE written on each one in green which is a little mickey mouse.
1,$200 bucks for practice balls???,"These same baseballs are available on this site for $35 per dozen. That's already too much for practice balls. You can get game balls for less than that on most baseball sites. However, in this package you're playing $200 for five dozen balls, which equals $40 per dozen. Sure, you get a bucket... which is a $3 value at any Home Depot. Or, you can go to any building-supply place and usually get one for free. So, here you're paying game-ball price for practice balls and $25 for a plastic bucket. Wow, what a deal..."
5,Great Practice Balls,"Great bang for your buck. Balls are of very good quality for practice, batting and catching. All of the balls fit nicely into the bucket and the bucket is sturdy and perfect height for sitting on."
5,Very Very Very Great Deal,"When i first saw this deal, I thought to myself its way too good to be true. I ordered the baseballs and three days later they arrived in two boxes one the bucket and the other the 5 boxes of twelve baseballs. I opened one box up to check them out and they are great! 60 high quality leather baseballs for 80 bucks what a deal!!! No regrets at all very great product for a great priceDefinitely a good deal order them for yourself there great!"
1,How much time do you have?,"This game is a blast- no way around it. But Steam, Valve's annoying memory hog run in the tray adware copyright protection content delivery application is a constant source of screaming fits. Every time I sit down and I just want to play for 30 minutes or something before work or school, Steam throws an error and refuses to let me into the game, even going so far as to tell me that I do not own the game, or its ""unavailable.""Valve is going to have to realize that treating customers like criminals is just bad business, and that Steam has GOT to go.I can no longer reccomend this game despite it's being so much fun, because at least %50 of the time I try to get in to play it, I am unable for some error."
1,"Excellent game, spoiled by the most intrusive piracy protection ever!","I endorse all the other reviewers postive comments about this game. As 1st person shooters go, it's about as good as they get. But I felt I had to post a warning for anyone who, like me, had no idea about this 'Steam' anti-piracy thing.Frankly, I thought some of the other reviewers were getting too worked up about it. After all, for goodness sake, how bad can it be?The answer is, very, very bad. I really, REALLY resent having to install this kind of adware on my machine, just so I can pay a game that I paid good cash for. I can't believe how intrusive the Steam system is, and much as I love this game, I will not ever buy any other product that forces me to install this junk on my machine, regardless of how good the game may be."
5,Great Collection,"great games that everyone with a pc should have. Just be sure to find it new. I got it used, but steam support gave me the persons account (no longer used) lol"
1,CD key didn't work and is taken,"This game requires steam to play, and without a cd key that isn't taken, u can't play it, therefore this order was completely useless."
3,"Lousey Install, Great game","In my 10+ years of computer gaming this is by far the worst installation program I've ever had with a game. As everyone else mentioned, you have to have an internet connection in order to even play it since it connects every time during bootup. Steam (the install program) automatically tries to connect every time I boot up the computer and then offers me updated news articles about upcoming gaming that I'm not even interested in. If you can get by all that, then the game is awesome...a complete upgrade of the first half life with realistic effects like instant death on head shots, corpse floating in water, blood splatter, and so on. A bit of advice to Valve...ditch Steam because it is a total turn off for gamers. I will definantley be deleting this game off my computer when I finish it."
1,You can't play what won't run,Do not spend your money on this game. You have to have an internet connection to install the game and it will take a long time to update and install. Then you may find as I have that the game crashes as it loads the first new game. I haven't seen a playable frame yet. This is supposed to be an episodic release and episode 1 will not even play. I will never buy another Valve product again.
3,Dialup users need not apply,"I haven't gotten to play the PC version yet, still updating over a dialup connection(3+ hours). I have played the Xbox version, which is supposed to be an exact port of the PC version. The game is awesome. Be prepared for a long ordeal to install over dialup. The DVD version if you can find it is really nice, only one disc. Smooth software install. After that the Steam software has to update then update some more, then it informed me I needed to update my Nvidea video driver, you might want to do that before you start if you haven't done that in awhile. After all that then it has to update the games you installed. I'm hopeful it will eventually finish and I can actually play the game."
1,What tech support ??,"The low rating does not reflect on the game since I can't install it without the key code which, unfortunately, wasn't enclosed. It is, however, an assessment of their tech support which has not responded to numerous emails. Perhaps the key code was on the manual which didn't arrive with the game, either, although there was a place for one in the case. Think long and hard before buying this one 'cause once you open it you can't return it !!!"
1,DO NOT BUY USED VALVE GAMES!!!,"The problem with games made by valve is they run off of steam and you need the cd key to play it trouble is the cd key can only be activated with one steam account so to put it short if you buy any valve games for pc used they [WILL NOT] work, save yourself the money and just download the game from steam if you can't live with out it. I learned the hard way by buying two used valve games Half Life 2 game of the year edition and Counter Strike 1 I can only imagine how many people have kicked themselves in the ass like I have because of this."
1,Sickingly Good Game.......... BUT STEAM IS THE BIGGEST PIECE OF CRAP EVER MADE,"Once upon a Christmas, a boy got Half-Life 2:GOTY Edition. He installed Steam, and also the game that went with it. Unknown to the wretches of evil that is Steam, the game says install complete. But it isn't. STEAM MAKE YOU DOWNLOAD THE WHOLE FREAKING GAME!!!!!! This means the 5CD pack I bought was really just for the freaking CD-Key! I've played Half-Life 2 in stores, but i didn't get to try it out, because Steam is not good for 56k modem connections, and broadband is out of option. If there were any way to get updates on CD, I would buy it. But for now, BE CAREFUL ON WHAT YOU BUY FROM VALVE!! THE PACKAGE ONLY SAYS ""INTERNET CONNECTION REQUIRED FOR ACTIVATION"" BUT IT DOESN'T TELL YOU THAT YOU HAVE TO UPDATE THE WHOLE PROGRAM! Valve, if you're reading this, please change Steam so we don't have to update the games in order to play them. Other than that, Half-Life 2 is the best game ever made."
1,half life 2,Bad experience loading the game. Fire walls stopped installation. Deleted same and gave away. Would not recomend.
2,Good apocalyptic vision,"The zanier a Gold book is, the more I like it, like a bad B movie.So I kind of liked this book."
2,gold is a commodity!!!!,"Gold is a commodity. Currencies, too!!When some of it increases in quantity its price decreases and viceversa!! BastaThe German Mark started with zero gold-backing, and was the strongest currency in the world as was the Austrian Schilling!!!Gold rises these days because the fundamentals are bullish as they are for the whole commodities sector after a 20 year bear-market. Monetary debasing is only one factor.No gloom and doom, please!!"
2,not as advertised,"This book was sold as brand new. I am fifty years old and have been handling books long enough to recognize when something is brand new or simply in good condition. I should have purchased one of the copies I saw advertised as used and saved a few bucks. Oh well. At least it was delivered in a timely manner, as promised."
5,Machel Montano is the greatest!!!,"Machel, I have always followed you ever since you were a child, your music has always made a difference when it comes to 'trini music' You create your own 'flava' and just the right 'umm' to it. Great CD"
1,Bootlegg??? I'm Unearthed and this is OOP,SHouldn't be sold thru Amazon... 100% this is a bootleg. Will order a copy and find out then take the manufacturing number and find out who mnanufactured. Stay Away... Unearthed Films
5,How I got what I wanted by playing a Game,"The title, The Game: Win Your Life in 90 Days couldn't be more accurate. I read this book in one evening. I found myself so excited to get into action and accomplish the things I had always wanted for myself. I began to play the game with a co-worker of mine and started to see results immediately. It was when I decided to take The Game Class through The Coaching Program that people around me started noticing the changes in me. They made comments like, 'you seem so much happier' and 'you have been so pleasant to be around'. I realized that by playing the game and getting out of life what I had always dreamed, I had a new vitality and it was clear to everyone around me. No amount of money could have bought this new lease on life."
1,Seminar/Book/Fraud,"I attended a seminar earlier in the year with Sarano Kelley where he advised us to sign up for his boot camp. Following the seminar after reading the book, I was interviewed by his wife brook and then by Sarano himself and told I qualified for the game. I gave them money and signed up to take the seminar. There was no call/no follow-up and no information from their organization.We were told that Brook, the wife was divorcing Mr. Kelley. We were further told after a period of time that we would get a refund for the game in very short order. To date, this has never occurred and there has been no follow-up from the organization."
1,Not helpful or interesting,"I thought I will find in this book interesting tips at the very least. Unfortunately, this author seems to withdraw them and keep them only for people that participate in his workshops... Why does he write the book then? I am sorry that I bought this book."
1,A big disappointment,"He's a good speaker, but the book did nothing for me--nor anyone else I know that read it."
1,There are better MUCH better books out there,"This book is very repetitive--it could have been condensed down to about 10 pages, and even those 10 pages wouldn't be worth it."
5,Fantastic!!!,"Doreen De Salvo hits the mark again with two outstanding futuristic erotic romances. I am sure you all don't need a run down of the plot again. But I will agree with my fellow reviewers. The plot is solid, with believable and engaging characters, and hotter than hot love scenes. You don't find many authors who can blend a fantastic plot and sizzling sex as well as Doreen De Salvo."
5,WOW!!!,"Great bookI've only read the first story so far, ""For the Love of Rigah."" But wow, this was a great story. The hero & heroine clashed on every page, but you felt the tenderness between them& knew they were meant to be together. Can't wait to read the second story and I'll definitely read more by Doreen DeSalvo."
4,A Great Read,"The other reviews go over the plot and characters, which were great and very complete. The sex scenes were great but I guess since it was presented to me as erotica, I expected more. That is the only reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 - but maybe I misunderstood. It's definitely a keeper no matter what!"
1,Completely disatisfied with the quality,I am completely disatisfied with this product. I used one of the Torx bit and the tip just completely broke into several pieces. I will be asking that it be replaced as soon as possible. I have had SK tools for over 25 years and this is the first time I had a serious quality issue. I am very supprised and this experience has me looking to other tool manufacturers that offer better quality. How do I go about getting a repalcement bit? Please advise. Thank you!
3,Good Christmas story,I read the book because I know the author who lives in my town. Interesting to learn some of his history.It's also well-written.
3,Much too sad for young children.,"A co-worker pointed out this story to me...We both felt that the book is really not appropriate for very young readers. While it is simply written, a story about starving elephants to death simply cannot be recommended for readers under the age of 10. Not only is there not a happy ending, the manner in which these creatures were treated is totally in-humane."
2,Sandy,"I've tried other barley powders and this is the worst. It fails to dissolve in water and makes a sandy, muddy mess. It tastes gritty and not very appetising at all. Not impressed."
5,He's Still The Greatest Rocker Alive,"Springsteen's latest live offering not only shows once again the power of his music and showcases the amazingly tight E Street Band, but puts nearly any other live record from other artists to shame. ""Land of Hope and Dreams"" is an instant classic, whether you are hearing it here for the first time or saw one of the 1999-2000 shows. ""American Skin (41 Shots)"" is chilling, terrifying and passionate. And as for great performances of great songs, the discussion begins and ends with ""Born to Run"" - one of the only classic songs on this set that is not re-arranged a little or a lot...But to do so would be like re-writing the ending of ""Casablanca"". You can't tamper with a classic like this. This is a great addition to Springsteen's canon, and a good sampler for someone who needs to believe all over again, in the power of Rock and Roll."
4,"NILS LOFGREN EXPLODES ON ""YOUNGSTOWN""","I recently saw the DVD of this performance and was blown away. I feel the set list for the double CD is a little uneven, and the new songs don't do a lot for me. But ""Youngstown""? What can I say? Nils Lofgren brings the crowd to its feet while simultaneously bringing me to my knees. Oh to play guitar like this man. In my opinion, the album is worth buying on the strength of his solo on ""Youngstown"" alone. I was disappointed by the new version of ""Atlantic City"", but then I thought, how could you possibly better the original? ""Murder Incorporated"" is also a standout. At the end of the day, it's Bruce Springsteen, it's the E-Street Band and it's live. It has to be good. Buy this album, then simply hit the repeat button on track 7."
5,Still and forever the Boss !!,"For those misled souls who may have forgotten who the Boss of rock is exactly, this is a powerful reminder. The double album delivers on its promise with a good mixture of old favorites like ""Prove it all night"" and ""Born to run"" and newer hits like the beautiful and controversial ""American Skin"". Many live albums fail to give the listener the experience of being at the concert but if you listen to this one from one end to the other, you will have as close a feeling of a Springsteen live performance as possible without being there. This includes the Boss addressing the audience a few times, including one great introduction of the East street band: ""you can't get there alone, you need help"" says the boss. The song Younstown is just awesome. If you like Springsteen, this album is a no-brainer. And if you don't, you may still learn to love him after listening to it."
2,"Another ""Live"" Letdown","Bruce can't do much right when it comes to live albums. Once again he includes the same songs, virtually identical versions, of songs we've heard too many times. Some of the more obscure material here is excellent, but to include a over 10 minute version of tenth ave. freezeout, with the ridiculous introductions of the band, was too much. Then to include the worst song he's ever continued playing live, Murder Inc., is incredible. I say his having seen him many times, and owning many boots that put this to shame. What a waste."
1,Save Your Money!,"I saw Springsteen in the Meadowlands at the beginning of his tour August 7, 1999, and he was teriffic. By the time he got to Madison Square Garden he was bored. He tweaks the numbers and tries to stylize them to be artistic. All he succeeds in doing is providing second class entertainment. Buy some of his older stuff and you will be better off. The ""Live/1975-85"" album is worth your time and money."
4,"A bit choppy, but good anyway","Listening to it now ... I'm a long-time fan and saw several Bruce shows on the last tour. Jungleland live makes it worth the price for this CD. But the whole thing doesn't flow too well. Born to Run is stuck in. Youngstown and Murder rock. Ramrod, too. Mansion is interesting -- sounds country. Let's face it, nothing can replace the live experience. But I'm sure I'll listen to this CD a couple dozen times or more."
2,A mess,"All these 5 star reviews are going to sound prety silly in a few months. While there are a few terrific moments - an overhauled ""River"" and ""USA"", ""Lost In the Flood"", a spirited ""Ramrod"" - the packaging is a mess, the sequencing horrid, the edits on ""Tenth"" and ""Badlands"" pointless, and the mix...where are the thunderous crowd sing-a-longs to ""Alantic City"", ""Badlands"", ""OITS"", and ""Tenth""? A rush job for a freaking television show, and given the fact that these two shows were momentous, hugely dissapointing. Seek out the boots and avoid Springsteens official live releases until he figures out how to do them well."
4,Great Live Bruce - Almost Perfect,"This is a great collection of Bruce songs from the recent concert. If you are a new fan, this would be an essential addition to your Bruce collection. I certainly would have preferred 2 or more discs full of material such as E St. Shuffle, Incident on 57th St., etc. However, the versions of American Skin, Land of Hope and Dreams, and Lost in the Flood are superb. I enjoyed the rendition of Tenth Avenue Freeze Out, but the band intros lose something at home; I may reburn the disc with the Capital Theatre '78 version instead. Hopefully, Bruce will follow the example set by Pearl Jam and release whole concert CD's from the last tour for his diehard fans."
3,Not the live Springsteen CD ...,"I have been a big fan of Bruce Springsteen for years and having had a chance to see him live, was looking forward to this CD. Springsteen's live performances are legend ... he is one of the few contemporary artists whose live performances defined his work - the energy and way in which songs were interpreted in live performances is something all fans remember.Although this live album captures some of this - somehow it falls short of the live performances of Springsteen and E-Street band in their prime. Hopefully, the record company and Springsteen will be able to issue some live recordings in compilation from past bootlegs in the future."
5,Still Great,"This live album by the Boss and the E Street Band is fantastic. Listening to the album brought back memories of seeing them live in Buffalo earlier in the tour where they rocked the arena. The album consists of a new haunting rendition of The River and a new, controversial, and heart felt song America Skin. The long rendition of Tenth Avenue Freezeout gets you pumped up and excited. It is great hearing the band play together, they never missed a step for being apart for so many years. Want to hear an album live that brings up issues of our society, this is the one."
3,Too much of it sounds alike,"I saw Springsteen twice during the 1999/2000 tour, including once at the Garden where this was recorded. I didn't feel he did as good of song selection this time as he did back in the eighties. Too much of it sounded alike to me. Don't get me wrong, there is some good stuff here. I particularly like ""If I Should Fall Behind"". But some of the stuff just sounds all alike.Just a quick comment about the live show itself - I couldn't believe how lousy his sound system was. And the Boss is so well known for his perfectionism and I was disappointed in how poor the sound was. His eighties shows were much better."
3,Springsteen live NY,"OK, nothing to write home about. At least don't look back is on this album, not the best, but It's on here. Poor editing in between songs, but, It's Bruce, who cares."
1,Compare with boots from 75-79!,"Before Springsteen was against taping his shows (...""all you bootleggers out there in radio land, roll yer tapes, a 1, 2, 3, 4..."" some of the best material was found from FM sources. This was raw, powerful, and uncontrived. Not that Bruce has totally lost touch with his roots, but his new accent...the country-western twang thing, I mean, where did the Jersey accent go? ""The Rangers had a homecoming in Hawwlum late last night""??Get a hold of some of the popular live stuff from '78 (or earlier!) and you won't believe your ears!"
5,NO WHINING!,"As one who was NOT able to get a ticket to any shows of this tour I find it hard to listen to those who have seen 3 have the nerve to complain about the CD. I would like to thank Bruce, Jon, Barbara, or HBO for having the consideration of blessing those of us who were left out with this beautiful compilation. Anyone saying he has less energy, less voice, less anything are obviously numb or anhedonic, because you will never find anyone who gives the way Bruce does. I've had too many negative concert experiences by those I thought were ""the ones"" to not appreciate any fraction of Bruce's efforts. May I also add that when he sang ""The River"" it truly felt like he was relating a piece of life from a 51 year old point of view, and, was he not crying for us in the end? The only time I will ever whine about Bruce is when I come up empty on a ticket. Again, thanks for sharing this with those of us who really do care."
4,Not a bootleg!,"After decades of no live releases of single Bruce performances, this is the closest official release to capture the feel of a Bruce show. My only criticism is the sloppy editing of Disc 2 where simply leaving the audience applause between tracks would make both disc flow as a single concert. I'm surprise Bruce & his production team didn't notice this on playback, since they are known to be perfectionists. Also, what's up with the sloppy track listing? They left off ""Born to Run"", which from a marketing standpoint is less effective. They had over a year to prepare this CD & I'm surprised it's less than perfect. However, since it's Bruce, it's still great, although a few little tweaks would have made it perfect. Maybe they should release a version 2.0 & make some more money!"
5,The Boss Is Back In Town!,"What else can I say? Bruce and the E Street Band are simply THE BEST live act around...no frills, no gimmicks, just great and meaningful music! I was fortunate to see them in Virginia Beach in 1973 when they were doing the big club circuit. This offering captures exactly what I remember way back then. Bruce is the most important American artist since Bob Dylan and Jimi Hendrix. What is so great is that even the so-called throw away tunes are dynamic and moving. I am not even going to attempt a song-by-song commentary, as that would only be a waste of time. Just trust me on this one...This is one of the best performances in our lifetime!"
5,BRUCE IS KING! AND HE IS BACK!,"Bruce is back with a live album. The album is well produced, he is back with his E Street Band, the songs are great, and he is in fine form.There are (2) discs of pure music enjoyment. Nothing like a Bruce Springsteen concert, and you can have it in your home or car as well.The old stand-by favorite ""Born In the USA"", his trademark song, others are ""Murder Incorporated"", ""Born To Run"", etc.This album gives what the fans have been yearning for more BRUCE! and live!Outstanding Live album right up there with Peter Frampton Live as one of the best live albums ever."
5,*Best Springsteen CD of the 21st Century*,"It is also the only one. I was somewhat surprised at some of the negative reviews already posted over selection of songs, not as good as LIVE, etc. This is rock CD by Bruce Springsteen; don't complain about song selection, rejoice that you have a new CD that is rock n roll.This CD projects Springsteen performing in the setting that made him an icon. It also showcases the fact that Springsteen has produced quality material for the past twenty-five years, which is quite an accomplishment.All of the songs are good and again he proves my point that all of his solo work is much better backed by the E Street Band."
2,sellout,i have been a huge bruce fan for 20+ years but i am disappointed in what i see as the only guy in the music business with the balls to put out quality now putting out such a shoddy product- lousy packaging- tinny sound quality- weird and inaccurate track listing and sequencing- one redeeming point- land of hope and dreams will remind bruce fans why they loved his music the first time they heard it-
4,Good for younger French students,"As a French teacher, I would recommend this for French students looking for something where the language isn't too difficult. I love all sorts of French films, but this is one of a few that can be used even for middle school French students. Although somewhat dated, the surprising topic makes it interesting. Students who aren't very advanced in French can nonetheless pick out some familiar words and phrases in this movie. The view of the French school system makes for some useful cultural comparisons. The original title was ""Fracture du Myocarde."""
4,Peter Jennings 1990 documentary about rise of drugs in U.S.,"this is an excellent documentary about the (then) rise of drugs, especially crack cocaine in the late 80's and early '90's. Peter Jennings narrates and interviews several professionals in the drug battle.Especailly emotional is an interview with a Oakland ER doctor who has to treat many alcohol and drug patients entering his ER daily.There is even footage of President Bush (Sr.) when he gave a national televised speech about the crack cocaine epidemic in the early 90's.Unfortunately, the drug problem has gotten worse over the past two decades. This video is interesting in an historical way as well as it gives a look at the beginning of the problem.* highly recommended *"
5,Realistic way to make a strong point,"There are so few films which deal with how Americans are dealing with the aftermath of the 9/11 terroist attacks and the fear and paranoia that follow. i didn't find it unrealistic, I think these characters were very believable. I think there are many people like Paul who felt like the government wasn't doing enough to protect its citizens and took on a guardian angel approach. There are other people like Lana who have a different perspective on it, maybe due to her travels and living abroad as an expat which helps her see things from a different perspective, but she is still deeply affected. I think this movie helps us see these two perspectives and therefore helps us deal with our personal grief and feelings about the terrorist attack. It is so important that Wenders has put the issue of 9/11 which was so publicised and hyped in the context of the homeless problem which is so completely ignored. This film is simple, but insightful."
3,Land of Plenty,"I love Michelle Williams, she did a superb job, as most of her work. However, I experienced some setback when purchasing, there were confusions with the vendor/s regarding my order, okmovie, and I am still fearful that I could, or maybe charged twice for the item. However, it did arrive promptly and the condition noted. I'm keeping my finger crossed that I am not being charged twice, as the outcome still premature."
2,Disappointing,"I agree with Mr. Barton's review in finding this movie established upon simply too many overly raw cliches in its heavyhanded treatment of the subject matter. As well, I am of this opinion despite more liberal political leanings.It's a shame, too, because Wenders is normally so subtle in his films, which I otherwise appreciate. An impressive performance from Michelle Williams manages to be essentially wasted in the process."
2,Broke after one year,"Got this to repair our broken bird table bracket. First off, the insert was too small for our 1.25"" pole so I wrapped it with many layers of electrical tape until I made it stout enough to fit. Jammed it in and it worked for a year until last night when it simply broke off. The weld points are pretty small. It would be better as a one-piece or if it had a solid weld."
3,Interesting Part of the Brecht Canon,"This play is Brecht's adaptation of Marlowe's Edward II. I suspect this play will be surprising to most readers of Brecht because it contains considerably less of the overt social satire and commentary associated usually with Brecht. More than anything else, this play is a character of study of Edward's refusal to heed social conventions. This play is surprisingly successful, at least when read. Brecht elevates Edward's wilfullness into a virtue and makes him a surprisingly sympathetic character. The play displays Brecht's wit and stagecraft quite well."
5,"HUGGLERS, MY FAVOURITE","I am five. Hugglers is fun and good! My favourite character is Freddi because I want to be like her. Miss Sara is a good teacher. I like Rollie, Wanda Boo, Chip and Burt too."
1,At the risk of sounding too critical...,"...I have to implore that fans of Jimmy Page, especially all you die-hard must-have collectors of Zeppelin/Page memorabilia like myself, avoid buying this book at any price! Juliann White's writing is so abysmal from start to finish, and the bewildering lack of editing so galling and obvious, that I actually felt embarrassed as I struggled to turn to another page of her subpar prose. One may feel the urge to add to their Page/Zeppelin collection like I mistakenly did, but cast that urge to the winds of doom and give this book no quarter."
1,Do not buy this book!!!,"The author has written an extremely unreadable book.Save your money for anything written by Chris Welch or Ritchie Yorke.Way better read.This lady is not an author, just a fan with really bad vocabulary.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!"
2,"it's out of print already? Gee, I can't imagine why.","Poor Julianne White. She is among the lucky few who can somehow get beyond high school and while not being able to write well, she can still get a book published. I have read most of the in print and out of print books on the Led Zeppelin topic and found this to be the most redundant of the bunch.Bad grammar and spelling set the pace at almost the very beginning for this tale of Jimmy Page and his merry men. Nothing new that hasn't graced the pages of a dozen other Led Zeppelin stories will be found in the first 7 chapters (that's as far as I read since begining it yesterday) so I suspect that will be the case for the remainder.The cover art and title are the best part of this book!"
1,Warning: stay the hell away from this book,"The material used in writing this thing is stolen from magazine articles, adding only horrible grammar, poor vocabulary and major inaccuracies. How could an editor read beyond its first page is a small wonder to me, let alone publish it. This is hands down the worst book I have ever read. Pretty funny at first but after a few irritating pages you just want to kick it in the fireplace to end its misery."
5,A Blast From The Past!,"Fans of Jimmy Page should know that this is the second biography about the guitarist written by this author. The first, being 'The Romantic Phenomenon Of Jimmy Page' which I just purchased. 'Jimmy Page Past Presence' is a comprehensive biography in which the author uses her knowledge of music and the entertainment industry and her extensive research to write about one of the world's most innovative and influential musicians. With heavy attention to his creativity, Juliann White explains the environment and the influences that created Jimmy Page and tells his life story. Ms. White's book will give insight into the Heavy Metal expressions of Jimmy Page."
4,This is a great book!!!,"I have no idea what all these other people who reviewed this book are complaining about. I loved it! The subjects do get juggled around in a chapter a bit. But it's full of information about Jimmy I didn't know. It tells about Jimena, their three kids, and Jimmy's ex's. I have never read any of that anywhere else, and I have read every book that has come out about Jimmy Page. I would recommend this book highly to any Jimmy Page fan! I would never even think of throwing it out!! And shame on all you people who only gave this book 1 star! You should be ashamed of yourselves!"
1,Do not WASTE your money buying this!,"This movie is a complete waste of money. You think when you purchase it that you will learn some new and exciting techniques. WRONG! The entire movie is a bunch of OLD HIPPIES talking about how great tantra is but NEVER once explain any of the basics of the method. A total waste of time. They even went so far as to put in some OLD porn star to talk about it. Again, you learn nothing from this dvd."
2,Good for people who don't have internet access,"This is a good strategy book for someone with no internet access. Oh wait, Dark Age of Camelot can only be played by people that have net access! D'oh!There are numerous web sites with more accurate, up-to-date information. Particularly in a game such as this which is being patched and changed constantly, a paper guide has limited value. Especially when the paper guide contains factual errors and bad character development advice.In my experience, the only truely useful part of this book is the bestiary. It's handy to have and seems to be pretty accurate and comprehensive.If you're too lazy to go online and find the information go ahead and buy this book but be advised of its limitations."
3,"Handier than the web,","This book is way out of date, but the best parts of it -- the reference tables -- are mostly correct. You can read the class info for a high level overview of each class, and the game info is useful if you are a newbie, but all that stuff has changed a lot since beta when this book was written. The maps are useless, obviously an afterthought.But the reference tables are still mostly correct, and the information in the bestiary in particular I haven't found anywhere on the web. The spell lists are easier to read in the book than on the web, but you need to check the web for spells that aren't in the book and that have changed.For all of the information in this book except the bestiary, you can find on the web and it's much more current. But I still refer to the book often just because it's handy."
2,Thankfully there's /respec,"OK, i'll be first to admit that it's handy to have the book around while i'm playing. having said that, prima really should've done their homework before putting out this ""new and revised"" edition. Or at least put out free addendums on the net somewhere! If you buy the book, remember that websites like the herald exist that are far more up to date and accurate than this book could ever be. Spell line info especially. DO NOT rely on this book for planning your character spec!!!"
2,I wish it were better,"The only reason this gets 2 stars is because its a little better than the first version but not by much. Maps are terrible, char guides are bad, inconsistent and wrong, online information is easier to find and use. Mob info is sparse and usless, drop info is just a print out. Sorry I want this to be a good book but its not. If you are totally new to the game you may feel that this is a good companion to your gaming however if you have any char > lvl 40 its kinna useless."
1,Marginally Useful,The guide is way out of date--descrepancies abound.The character development information is uninspired to say the least and down right misleading in many cases. I could have done as good a job without ever having played the game.The maps are useless to all but the neophyte player. The cross reference section is a shameful waste of trees. What's the point?Don't waste you're money.
3,Good for getting started...,"This book is good for understanding combat and building a character but assumes knowledge of the game that beginners may not have. It is definitely not a how-to play guide, it is strictly a combat and character building strategy guide. Personally I needed a lot more detail than it gave about actual game play but it was great for weighing the pros and cons of various classes and weapons. One thing I will say for it is that it is much much more detailed than the guide that comes with the game itself."
2,"A few nice things, a lot of wasted effort","I bought this guide along with the game, on the suggestion of a friend. After wading through mounds of trivialities, I was sorely disappointed. It doesn't provide any maps that actually tell you anything but the basic buildings and road paths in a given city --not even what the buildings are. Add to that the fact that every class section is about 1-2 page summary that glosses over the class. No indication what spells really do except whether they are a buff, direct damage, area effect, etc. Overall, I think I get better information from some of the worst Dark Age of Camelot websites on the internet. The most useful things I found was a little bit of generic flavor and a couple of the listed websites (which you can find with any decent search engine)."
1,Very Disaponted - lots of infomation Wrong and Missing.,"First off the Loot drop list of lynn barfog is missing all the upper level mobs and Epic mobs. Also they are many errors I have found on the drops of Albion mobs. The Maps are missing some important mob that you might be loogin for if you looking for drops. I got this book for the loot drops, it was missing 1/2 of what I was looking for(lynn barfog and some of the mob locations on name dartmoor mobs). If you need map go online, as for loot drops ask around. This book does not have enought infomation to warent its price."
4,Out Of Date Now :(,"I was actually one of the people that helped put this book together. I must say that I was a bit dissapointed with the finished product when compared to what we envisioned. The monster listing and loot listings are very handy though, especially when you are trying to level up, but with the curse of deadlines and having to ship to the printer, many things got left out.Also, since DAoC is a persistent world, there are always updates to the content. When the book came out, it was an adequate resource, but now it is sadly out of date. However, I have high hopes for the Catacombs guide. Give that a look!"
2,WARNING....,"The editorial review of the guide refers to the Shrouded Isles expansion guide, so if you're going by that info you're not going to like what you get."
1,Use the Web instead,"The info in this guide is outdated and will lead to much frustration. Better no data than bad data.Go to Mythic's website, click on links and follow the fansite links for far more complete information and advice than this hunk o junk would ever give you."
3,"Mostly good, but lacking in parts and out of date","As stated above, this book is VERY out of date. This game on average updated every other week. It is impossible to write a guide to a game like that and have it be 100% accurate. It is also lacking in many place. For one thing, the dungeon areas are not talked about at all. The map section, which the front and back of the book advertised in bold letters, was a joke. The major city maps are simply maps takn off daatlas.com and stripped of labels. The town and village maps are not so much maps as they are arial photographs. There are no dungeon maps.In short, I liked this book and it was useful, but I expected just a bit more."
2,A decent guide...when it was published,"Let's face it. Strategy guides for MMOGs are nothing more than an exercise in futility. By the time the guide goes from the editor's desk to store shelves, the entire game could have been redone. A few months later, the strategies described could be unrecognizable at best.And nowhere is this more evident than with Prima's strategy guide for Dark Age of Camelot. While a worthy reference at the time, subsequent changes have rendered much of the information in it useless. New spell lines were added, classes were rebuilt, entirely new zones and features were added. But the guide stayed the same, unable to update.In the first month or so of this game, I kept it as one of my most prized resources. But the inescapable flow of time has rendered it anything but. Unless you're sending this book into the past via a time machine, do not bother purchasing it."
1,No Shrouded Isles Info as promised,"I have poured through this book since I received it yesterday. The only reason I bought it was that the editorial review said, ""Detailed maps for every zone, city, and dungeon in Avalon, Aegir, and Hy Brasil.""I can't find them. Maybe it's the books poor layout, but baring content page oversights, no index, etc., they don't list them. I believe they simply aren't there.Am I being hasty? Are they hidden someplace?..."
2,Poor Effort - many mistakes,"The maps for albion are missing the location of many mobs that have the drops that you would be looking for. Lynn Brafog has none of the loot list of the Higer mobs that have the most desirable loot from there. Lyoness some of the mob are missing drops especial if there is a common drop and a magical drop with the same name and magical properties. I got this book for loot drop location and % chance of drops. I was disapointed, the maps can eaisly be found online."
1,u pansys!,"What is wrong with u guys! Its an ON-LINE GAME! Your supposed to make mistakes and get strong the hard way! Thats what makes it FUN! I could understand you using a strategy guide to beat an Xbox RPG, but not on-line. It takes all the fun out of it! But hey, if your too much of a wimp to make some mistakes on the game, than buy. You'll get strong, but you'll never have true power."
1,Not just low cost LOW QUALITY,"These pads are not worth it as one needs two rather than one to keep the floors from getting wet. Even then, it is not guaranteed. The are terrible quality, much unlike their competition sold by other companies. Even the discount brands sold by others are better than these. Don't waste your money."
3,You get what you pay for,"I was quite pleased to get 200 for the price of 75 at the local Petco. Here is the catch...... you get what you pay for. The pads appear to be the same quality as the name brand ones, except that they are packed together before the plastic has completely dried, so they stick together. When you separate them, you end up with small holes in the bottom of almost every pad.So if you are using a mat holder, then you are fine except you'll need to clean up a bit of what spills through the small holes. But if you are using these in another room without the mat holder, then be prepared to have to clean up your carpet........."
3,"What can I say, they are generic but they do the job...","We have a puppy Shih Tzu, kind stubborn but is getting there. She's not entirely house broken and has an occasional accident. So we are using wee-wee pads to train her. They are working but she goes through a lot of them. We were purchasing Four Paws wee-wee pads but however they cost to much. We decided to scale down to the generic and we like them, they do the job just fine for us.."
5,great,"i have tried all types of wee wee pads for my 2 small dogs. These come in a box of 100, price is good and they work!"
2,"For the Dollar, you can't beat it","I was a little disappointed to find that the padding within each pad did not cover the entire plastic on the potty pad. A little frusterating, when your dog is anticipating on going on an absorbant portion of the pad.For $20, you really can't beat 100 potty pads. But then again, I guess you get what you pay for."
5,Powerful Storytelling,A wonderfully produced short story that is powerful in it's message. A truly captivating experience.
5,Touches Your Soul! A Must See! Tugs At The Heart For Sure!,"Even though this video is only 15 minutes, it would be impossible to expand it further without distorting the touchingly beautiful story. The photography was incredible, the film itself, poignant. That said, the price to buy should not be so high, but it is a good film that warms your heart. The young actor who plays the young boy is magnificent. YOU WILL WANT TO WATCH THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN!!"
1,In The Arms Of Angels,"The 'clip' was much too short.... not worth the money. I felt cheated. If you read the synopsis, that in itself tells you everything.... two kids find themselves in the middle of an avalanche of rocks coming down a mountain, they somehow avoid injury and attribute their fate to having be saved by an angel.... the end. The film was about 5 mins. long. Save your money or watch a full length feature."
1,IN THE ARMS OF ANGELS,I ORDERED THIS DVD AND i am extremely disappointed in it only 14 minutes longi was under the impression it was a full length movie
3,In the Arms of Angels,I didn't know it was a very short video. I thought it was a entire movie. It is a very good short film if you expect to see just that.
5,Great Book to start with!,"I used this book about 5 years ago when I was first considering my Technician License. Even though I was familar with the techincal aspects of the hobby, the book presented each topic in lite and mostly humerous way. If you read this book you will be assured of getting the first rung of the amature license behind you, and can begin exploring this unique hobby."
5,"If you don't like this, you are not a doom metal fan.","This is quite simply one of the greatest albums I have ever heard. Every song is stunningly unique, with their own personality, vibe, emotion to them. All the instruments are extremely well placed. The lyrics are incredibly epic and fantastical.Normally I don't give out 5 star reviews so easily, but as I find, I cannot fathom giving this less than 5 stars.Every song is incredible, but the real masterpiece is the 21 minute epic finale ""Cirith Ungol"". This has got to be THE greatest song I've ever heard, besides Sabbat's ""The Dwelling"". Albert's voice and lyrics never fail to give me the creeps.If you are a fan of Black Sabbath, Saint Vitus, Witchfinder General, and want a slower version of these bands, check Reverend Bizarre out. NOW."
5,I am first to review THIS huh?? YOU POSERS!!,''FUKK THE WEAK STONER BULL S*IT..METAL RULES!!!!!!!-REVEREND BIZARREThese guys hail from Finland!! land of many great bands!!This is one KILLER album here!!This is DOOM and more DOOM..a total rehash of Cathedral's 1991 MASTERPEICE ''FOREST OF EQUILRIBIUM'' but with other elements as well!!These songs are LONNNNNNNGGGGG!!Each song is very different from the next!! each song sorta like their own little MENTAL FUNERAL..each a journey through your thoughts!''Cirith Ungol''(yes a great band..which influenced the REV!) the last song..is one of the most depressing things these ears have ever heard!! just wait till the end of this hits you with a huge steaming BASS line over cloud rumbles!!If you worshiped the FOREST ALBUM by CATHEDRAL this is a MUST OWN!!!!!''WE MUST FACE WHAT WE FEAR..STARE IN THE EYES OF TERROR''''DOOM WHAT THOU WILT SHALL BE THE WHOLE OF THE LAW''
4,Great entry in the Bloomsbury Series,"This first book in Bloomsbury's movie guide series is, so far, the best of the lot. Full of interesting and often hilarious insights and observations, this A to Z guide to the film actually works fairly well as a straight-through read. I particularly enjoyed the references to the place of water buffalo in classical dramatic structure."
2,Disappointing,"phil_swanwick@hotmail.com The author's dictionary format did not suit the ambiguous and anti-establishment setup of the movie at all. Besides the formatting, it does include some ineresting and sometimes deep analysis of the plot, characters and underlying principles. A solid review, but inadequate as a profesional work and hardly worth buying"
5,A compellingly good read that I couldn't put down.,"This is a terrific story woven in a fantastic mix of medieval romance, fantasy, and even comedy. Ms. Biondine creates vivid landscapes, and characters that feel real and alive. As a design professional, I was truly impressed that Ms. Biondine's details & descriptions are fluid and easy yet wonderfully imaginative. I couldn't help feeling conected with the characters and settings. I'm hoping this is part of a series of books on these characters."
2,OK Monitor - False Description,"I just received the Pyle PLVW1782R today and upon opening the box I noticed that the resolution is only 1024 x 768. On Pyle's website it even states that this monitor is 1280 x 1024 which was the reason that I bought this product so I don't know if I was sent an old model or what?! The actual resolution is printed right on the packaging! It also states that there are 2 A/V inputs and that was also a lie. There are 2 Video inputs but only 1 Audio so I now have to buy an additional adapter to make up for it. The screen itself seems to be okay. We'll see once it is installed. It would be nice if the seller, or even the manufacturer could get the product description correct though. Thanks....I guess?"
4,12 Volt Monitor,I installed this monitor in my conversion van. I love the wide screen. The only hangup is it doesn't have it's own amplifier. Had to install a videoplayer and an amplifier to make it work. The picture has true color and is very managable to operate. A very good buy thru Amazon.
5,Great series,"Love this series! Colonel Jorge Guillermo Frade is shot cold-blooded in his native Argentina, because he is beginning to sympathize with the Americans in the war. How will his son, Major Cletus Howell Frade, of the USMCR react?What assignment will the special OSS agents have this time?Sequel to Honor Bound. Hans-Peter von Wachtstein, Tony Pelosi, David Ettinger, Subofficial Mayor Enrico Rodriguez, Colonel Graham, Dorotea Mallin, all return."
2,"Great buildup, but to what?","I enjoyed this book for the first 700 pages tremendously. However, I soon realized that the only way to wrap up all the complex story lines Griffin offered us, was by a disappointing ending. My worst fears were realized when the book came to a screeching halt. The climax was lackluster at best and entire story lines were completely forgotten. I enjoyed the great character development, however, there were at least 1/2 dozen characters that were completely left hanging when the end came. It was almost as if Griffin had a 723 page limit and was ineffective at providing a successful conclusion to all the plots derived. I was extremely disappointed when I put the book down, and question if I should read any other books by Griffin, despite all the critical acclaim he receives."
2,A disappointing sequel.,"Unlike most of W.E.B. Griffin's books which skillfully blend the story with historical background, 'Blood and Honor' paints a fascinating historical perspective at the expense of the story. The story line is much sketchier and less believeable than the original 'Honorbound'. I was not as caught up in the story as I usually am with Mr. Griffin's books. It is as if Mr. Griffin got caught up in the killing side of international intrique rather than exploring the full range of possibilities ans he did in 'Honorbound'.Overall, I would recommend this book the the loyal fans of Mr. Griffen or those who are looking for the details of WWII South American intrique.It is my hope that this is a bridge to future books in the series that will depend on the historical background and develop an interesting story off the background."
4,Great read.,"I really enjoyed this book as I did the first in the series. I am delighted to have found this series, I am assured of lots of good reading for a long while. And finding it late has the additional benefit of not having to wait years between books."
5,H e Makes You Care,"I get almost annoyed that I get so involved with the characters and plots of Griffin's books.I HATE it when they end,I waited for however long it takes for the sequels.I may not like killing off the good col.Frade,but that's life,and it goes on.I care about the good Germans,like Kurt,fighting their inner battles for their own souls and survival in a world filled with the deadliest of dangers.You can't put a Griffin book down and I guess that is what it was all about.Some I have read more than once.I like the WWII books best.They put me a little in touch with the world that formed my parents lives,as he helped chase the nazis across Europe and my mother worried herself sick at home,while doing her part in the effort."
2,"Doesn't Live up to ""Griffin"" reputation","After reading (and enjoying) many books in other series by Griffin, I have more recently read both Honor Bound and Blood & Honor. While Griffin still paints the details and atmosphere of wartime Argentina, I found Blood & Honor to fall short. I didn't have the gripping power of his other books and when it was all said and done, I'm not so sure I want to move on to book 3 in the series. I violated my own ""100 page rule"" (if you are not gripped by the first 100 pages, stop reading) and finished the book, much to my dismay. On the bright side I have validated the 100 Page Rule!"
3,"Amusing, but not a page turner...","The writing was light hearted and the descriptions of Maggie the cat trying to cope with the human world were terrific, but overall I found the book slightly disappointing. It had no depth or real emotion, and relied a little too much on amusing descriptions and one-liners."
2,Not My Fancy,"The Cat's Fancy had potential, lot's of it, but it was never used. Although the whole idea was original and cute it wasn't developed nearly as much as it could have been. There could have been more depth to the characters and there could have been better scenes and it could have been better written. It's too bad that such a good idea for a book was never completely developed into what could have been a really bestseller."
2,"Cute, tame, weak",The male is a dope and the cat/woman transformation doesn't make you care or believe it might happen. Tolerable writing.The one love scene at the end of the book doesn't make it worth carrying around the outrageous cover!
2,Very Original,"This was definitely one of the most original romance novels I've ever read. Seeing through the eyes of the cat-woman was definitely a different take on things.However, there wasn't all that much romantic chemistry between the lovers. The gimmick sort of overwhelmed the love story."
3,Must admit was somewhat dissapointing,"I was waiting with great anticipation to get this book but when I read it I was not completely blown away like I expected. It was cute and fluffy but I do not really think it had much substance. I was hoping for a little more spunk and a lot less adoration without reason. I like her as a cat more she was much cuter and had more personality, shedding all over the other woman's stuff was just darling. But if you want a cute story just read this."
3,"Cute and diverting, nothing more.","Attorney Nicholas Goodman's cat Maggie is hopelessly in love with him, so much so that she risks everything to become a human for a limited time to try and win his heart for her own (only then can she stay human). Too bad 'her Nicholas' is about to enter into a marriage of convenience with the daughter of one of his firm's biggest clients. Can Maggie's unconditional and pure love save Nicholas from a terrible mistake?The Cat's Fancy is a cute enough piece of fluff, but it lacks a certain realistic anchor to make Maggie's love seem truly magical. Nonetheless the story and characters are entertaining and sweet enough to make worthwhile reading for those who want a little special magic in their romances."
2,No plot whatsoever,"I loved Julie Kenner's books - the demon-hunting soccer mom series, the teenage vampire books, pretty much anything she writes. But this...... it's dreck. Drivel. And mildly entertaining but hugely disappointing at the same time due to the lack of any substance whatsoever. Although there is only a lame plot, Kenner's writing does keep your attention. I just wish there was more to this book than [SPOILER] a cat being in love with its owner, and becoming human in order to have him love her, too. That's it - the whole plot. It is a rip-off of the Little Mermaid by Hans Christian Anderson, which the author acknowledges in one passage.Don't waste your time unless you have nothing better to read. (try the phone book)"
2,"Poor romance, poor paranormal, just poor","Maggie, a black cat, has fallen in love with her owner Nicholas. She goes to the head cat (wth?) and asks to be made human. He grants her the wish under the condition that she has until Halloween (just over a week away) to make him say ""I love You"". This book was so cheesy! The romance parts were pretty bad. The only redeeming part of this book was the awesome side characters, Deenie and Hoop. Some parts of Maggie finding 'her feet' in the real world were cute. This plot could have made for a fun, lighthearted paranormal story but it just doesn't work here. I apologize to Julie Kenner because everything else I've read by her has been golden."
5,READ IT!,"Hi all, I just completed Julie Kenner's ""The Cat's Fancy"". It is a contemperary. Maggie ""the cat"" is in love with her owner Nickolas. So what is a kitty to do? Well, in Maggies case, talk to the old Tom. Mistic one eyed cat that he is, Maggie gets to be human for one week. But she has to get Nick to say the three magic words. This won't be difficult, or will it? I found this to be a laugh out loud story. Maggie is just so much cat. Nick is a lawyer, hmmm, aren't they the stodgy type?I deffinately reccomend this book.Brenna"
2,Not All There,"The Cat's Fancy is a story of a cat that is in love with her owner. She is given until Halloween to get him to tell her human form, that he loves her. Maggie (both the cats name and the humans name) shows up naked and willing to do almost anything to get her owner, Nicholas, to say he loves her. The characters for Maggie and Nicholas lack luster and true desire for one another. There was too much ""cat"" in Maggie character and not enough real man in Nicholas. The only real redeeming bit of this novel are the sister and best friend characters (Deena and Hoop). Deena is the magic loving artist that knows Maggie for what she really is, while Hoop is the lovable best friend that just wants whatever it is to keep Nicholas happy. I've read a number of books by Julie Kenner and this is not one of her better stories."
4,Nice to Hook the Newbies,"A friend of mine owns a gaming shop, and we popped open a copy to use as the store copy. Got some people interested in the game at a relatively small cost, and the SR3 books started selling off the shelves like hotcakes and i got 8 new people wanting to play my game. If you already own any Shadowrun stuff it's not worth it, but if you just want to check the game out it's a great tool for new players. You'll still need to nab SR3 or SR2 if you want to seriously play, but this book is a good way to see if you're interested especially if you don't know anyone who owns a copy of either edition that you can borrow or read."
2,Easy start but...,"I'll be honest. This book helps you with the basics. But you NEED the SR3 book, its just so much better. This book provides a pretty good START, but if you wish to continue, you would do better to check out the subjects described in the book, in the SR3. It's not even an equipment list! Whats up with that? An if you want to start off by creating your own characters, you should get the SR3 too. My final rating? Useless without SR3, great for explaining basics. (Also it's great for players generally... cuz it explains the basics VERY well) But FASA should do better next time. Besides... what about the sample mission? GREAT. That's one of the highlights in my opinion..."
5,Excellent Service,Everything about the book was as advertised an it arrived unexpectedly early. Everything about the book was as advertised an it arrived unexpectedly early.
4,World War II Vignettes,"With any compilation from various authors, the articles in that type of book tend to be a bit uneven. Some articles are excellent, others less so. That is the situation with this work, I feel. There are the majority of articles which rate five stars, and there are some which go as low as three. I have therefore averaged out my ratings as a whole, and come up with this four star rating opinion. That having been said, let me recommend this work to you if you are at all interested in learning little bits and pieces about important parts of WW II. It is also quite possible that you will enjoy some of the articles that I did not, for everyone's take on writing is subjective. You may not learn a lot of new information in this book, but at its best the info is presented in extremely interesting ways, and even in some of the lower- rated articles, there are still nuggets of information which I appreciated receiving. You won't be disappointed by reading this work."
2,uber disappointment,this looked like tim allens best movie from the trailers id seen. looked hillarious. well who ever produced those trailers should should get an award as the movie was not nearly as enertaining as it looked in the trailer
4,great to watch when you need a good laugh,I knew Tim Allen would be funney but most of the laughs in this film come from the perfectly playedNutzzoid charactures of the women in the cast. Some even reminded me of women I actually know!After much amusement and laughter I ended the movie thinking that had I been involved with such awacky bunch of women I would have never let anyone know I was still alive. But its also a good moralpointer that shows just how complicated a mans life (and death) can become if he does not restrainhimself and remain faithful to one woman. This movie is FUNNY and not what you would expect it to be.GRIZZ
4,excellent easy and elegant variety of receipes for all year,"This book contains complete menus for all 4 season,the receipes are moderatly easy to prepare and they are a little different so to wow your guests with something special. A must have for anyone who likes to entertain elegantly and easily."
4,"A Great Book for Behavioral VHDL, Not for Synthesis","This book goes into great detail on variable typing, subtyping, and all aspects of behavioral modeling. It's extremely detailed and thourough. If you just want to learn the intricacies of VHDL and only expect to write test benches and behavioral models, this is definitely the book for you. If you're looking for a practical book that will help you to write synthesizable code, look somewhere else. The book does have a 17-page appendix on synthesis, but that's pretty much it. All the ""case studies"" are behavioral, even the RTL models."
3,Not a practical guide,"If you are an engineer, like me, wanting to teach yourself VHDL then this is NOT the book for you. The actual mechanics of how to write VHDL code is lost in all of the doctrine superfluously created by the author. The examples he gives in order to clarify points only serve to make the concepts more mysterious. The book fails to make the connection between the software world and what the results of the language are in hardware. The index is minimal and I found it practically useless. It is an exhaustive work with many exercises, but as for practicality--I give it a big thumbs down."
1,ELVIS PRESLEY KARAOKE,"The musics are very well played, but they have 50'' over, it's impossible sing a song like that, 'cause they don't start and don't finish."
1,Elvis Presley Karaoke by Jordnaires,This is said karaoke but is not a karaoke(no words on screen) and no lyrics for the songs. Not only that it does not have the whole songs. you can not sing with it. Don't throw your money away on this. This should not have been called Karaoke.
1,NOT KARAOKE!!!,"This CD does not play in a standard Karaoke machine, there are no words. This should not be sold as a Karaoke CD. That is misleading."
1,"Heartbreak Hotel, very Disappointed","I am a new Karaoke fan, so I didnt know about the difference of CDG. I am a huge Elvis fan and saw how many songs were on this CD and jumped on ordering without reading any reviews. I was so disappointed when there were no lyrics, I could sing the songs, but my friends had a lot of trouble and without even a written version of the lyrics it was hard since the songs were not full version.yes the music is great but way to hard to do for fun Karaoke"
4,good!,I liked this book. I wasn't sure after reading the back. I thought it would be just like the others with this same plot. But the boy wasn't THAT bad and the girl wasn't THAT good. It was fun and I would happily read more of Ms. Ortolon's books.
4,Fun and Entertaining,"I originally bought the book because I was attracted to the cover and the back cover blurb sounded interesting. I read it in two evenings and found it a fun book. Easy to read. I liked Laura as a character more than Brent; I felt the author developed her heroine much more than the hero; put her through more 'growth' than Brent.This is a very good debut book, and I am looking forward to Ms. Ortolon's next release."
4,For the hardcore SQL user,"This is a great reference for how SQL works. It is slightly outdated compared to the lastest version of MS SQL but if you want to build up your theory or knowledge, this is the way to go. Tons of golden nuggets that provide some good insight of how a DB works. Very useful to have."
3,Not that great!!,I was not at all impressed with the contents. This book is geared more for the lower grades.
1,Read the book.,Don't waste your time with this cheat sheet. Read the real book. Become enlightened. It's excellent and I can't seem to understand why people would want to cheat themselves out of such powerfull knowledge.
3,hmmmm...,"this was an okay album. its kinda slow for me and doesn't get me pumped like ""lights out"" does and i thought that the older angry samoans were better and more energetic but this album is still rad."
2,hmmm....,Does every mildly popular old punk band have to do some... reuinion now? Nothing sadder than a bunch of former punks that have become yuppies and now look at their old bands as a way to make big money in their old age.
5,amazing,"I could listen to Mr. Clean forever. One of my favorites along with Miles in the Sky, Blue Train, Donald Byrd's Blackjack, and Herbie Hancock's Fat Albert Rotunda."
2,Straight Life - lacking,"As i mentioned previously, the copy I received seemed to lack fidelity and the tempo was faster then the original album. Not a quality disk copy.JW"
3,The scissors are a nice touch,"The knives are sharp but don't expect longevity with them if you do not wipe blades dry as soon as you wash. Also they tend to rust on the edge side so once again dry after washing and they should be fine. I would like to mention though that two of the blades fell off the handle within 3 months of owning them - I still don't know how? But then the other 13 pieces are still working and for the deal I got, what do I expect."
4,PUBLISHER SHARES VALUABLE KNOWLEDGE IN UNDERPROMOTED BOOK,"At first glance this is a rather pricey manual for starting a publishing company, but MUSIC PUBLISHING covers the process from top to bottom, beginning with the obvious first step of setting up the business and continuing clear down to the more sophisticated problem of administering others' catalogs. Each music business author has a unique approach, and Whitsett proves to be unusually well qualified to advise publishers, thanks to his wealth of domestic and foreign experience working with major publishers. The mouth-watering chapter in Whitsett's book, which echoes most young songwriters' first question, is ""How Much Can I Really Earn from a Hit Song?"" For anyone contemplating a venture into publishing, I strongly recommend Tim Whitsett's guidebook. Ron Simpson"
2,Pitch too high,I thought that I could use this call while bow hunting in order to stop a buck for the shot. The pitch of this call is way too high. I went on the knight and hale website to watch a video of the call and my call sounds nothing like theirs. Kind of disappointed and there isn't really a good way to adjust the pitch. I tried moving the reed and holder around and the pitch is really dependant on the pressure on the reed holder. I cannot get it to sound good. Obvious the call should make a deeper sound as shown in the knight and hale video.
5,Can't seem to get enough!,"I fell in love with Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee (where else?) in Jamaica! I love the rich, deep aroma and the smooth non-acid taste. This is one of the only coffees that doesn't irritate my stomach. Yes, it's expensive but well worth the treat. I tend to give this as a gift to friends and family and it's become so popular that I even get requests for it by name! I buy it in both ground and whole bean."
5,Jamaican Vacation Without Leaving Home,"As I sit in my home in Chicago the morning after an all day/night ice storm enjoying a cup of this wonderful brew, I pause to thank both God and Reggie for this perfect moment. Outside, all is beautifully coated in crystal. Inside, I am savoring this perfect cup of coffee. I'll be back!!"
4,First review from me,"I found this artist and her album awesome if you like a mixture of Toni Braxton, Roberta Flack kind of feel. I do not know why this was discontinued. Most of the songs are soulful but are still in the R & B mix. I would not hesitate to buy another of her albums. Of course if you like this kind of music it is a primo album to listen to. Good for those romantic nights with your partner etc."
5,More than worth the price,"I purchased this study book for my daughter who had just finished cosmetology school and was scheduled to take the state boards test. She is sometimes known for not taking studing very seriously or being prepaired for tests. She took the pracitce tests and studied areas where she was missing questions. When she took the board exam she passed the first try and told me that she sure was glad that I had gotten her this study book, many of the same questions appeared on the test."
1,Not Helpful,"I bought this book based on the description, thinking it would have lots of information about the boards in all 50 states and possible information about license renewal and continuing education. The whole book is just the practice exam with the last few pages having contact info for the board (which I could have gotten online). The contact info is out of date (I know at least one of the states is now governed by a different board) and doesn't list all 50 states. If you're just looking for the practice exam, it probably works fine, but the description was misleading to me."
2,"Cosmetology Certification Exam, 3rd Edition (Cosmetology Licensing Exam)",It seemed to me that the content was outdated with current standards. I thought the test taking skills were helpful. I definetly would not use this as my only study guide. I found the other two textbook standards to be much better. I had to take the written exam after four years because I moved states. So take it for what its worth. I recommend doing a good search for materials before you buy anything. There are some good online study guide websites.
2,Nationalism And Sexuality By George L. Mosse,Enlightening discussion of how sexuality and the youth movement in Germany around WWI created a strong sense of nationalism
3,Slow Motion,The movie at first appears to be a character study that could be interesting. The Na character does evolve and we get to understand her. The Ton character is seemingly unattended by the director except in fits and starts. the movie ends without resolution as if the producer and director ran out of money or could not figure out how to end the story arc.
4,Imperfect but moving and atmospheric first feature,"It's funny, most critics either didn't like this (too thin,boring) or loved it (delicate, tells somuch with so little).I found myself in the middle, understanding both sides.This gentle, quiet, slow moving romance between a Thaiwoman who runs a nearly abandoned hotel, and an architectwho comes to town to help repair a local beach resort after itwas devastated by the Tsunami has moments of great graceand tenderness, and moments that feel either heavy handed,or not-quite earned.There's an attempt to capture the spooky atmosphere of atown that's been destroyed, leaving behind thousands of ghosts.That works well when it's unspoken and vague, a little less wellwhen it's made concrete in the form of the lead woman's angryrootless bother and her friends, who bring literal violence anddanger into the story, in a slightly forced way.None-the-less, a well made, well acted, well shot, thought provoking first feature."
5,great piece of work.,5 stars for the baddest white girl that ever recorded music! In the age of over production and sampled R&B hits- Teena gives us real music. The woman gives her all in ever song. You feel the emotions of ever word. I just want to know when is Teena going to give us some new stuff. Hopefully she can work with Rick James again and show all these other cats how to produce a real ablum.
3,wondered whatever happened to Teena Marie,"Saw Teena Marie at Atlantic City in the 70's............singing ""lovergirl""Great voice............still has a great voice.............."
5,The BEST stain remover in existence!,"Not only is this formaldehyde-free and non-toxic, but it gets out every kind of stain. This is the only stain remover I will use on my toddler's clothes. Just bought a 9-pack, so I'm set for at least a year...maybe 2."
5,The best ever!,This stuff will get red lipstick out of a white towel! And that's without the addition of chlorine bleach.I like this better than Shout or Spray 'n Wash. The fact that it doesn't contain any poisonous chemicals is also a plus. I don't know what I did before I discovered Ecover.
2,It doesn't do any good for pit stain,I bought it for removing some pit stains as suggested by some reviewers. Didn't work at all. I give it 2 stars as it was mediocre in removing other type of stains.
4,Cute little panty,"This is a cute little panty. I was looking for this specific style: lace boy-cut with a sexy lace-up back. The material and ribbon are flimsy and thin and probably not worth the approximately $16 I paid for it, including shipping. Every time I wash it, I have to re-lace the string. However, I still love the item because it was exactly what I was looking for and couldn't find it elsewhere for cheaper. The item was packaged nicely in a ziploc bag."
5,Best Comedy School Anime You Ever Seen!,I was already a fan of School Rumble before it came to the states. I must say that this is the only Anime that got me watching it so many times and it always cheer me up. This is a must buy if your are a fan of this series but if your a newcomer you will still enjoy it regardless. So go buy it.
3,The Real Son of Sam,"As a murder and serial killer movie fanatic I wasn't too blown away by this film. However, I tend to prefer films which are not documentary like, and this one was. However, if that is your cup of tea ... I would recommend this movie to you definitely! This film provides actual interviews with the involved detectives and footage from some of the incedences."
4,Don't use this as your only study tool,"Many folks use this book to study for the CISSP exam. It's good to research specific topics, but don't use this book as your only study tool."
1,Are you preparing for the CISSP exam?,"On the market there are too few books which cover all the 10 Common Body of Knowledge of the CISSP exam. Get this book if you really need a ""comprehansive"" study guide."
4,"It's not an end-all, but it's a great reference book","I'm currently using it to study for the CISSP examination, so I read it cover to cover (Which was not an easy thing to do). The authors use quite a bit of jargon and get very cerebral at times, so have some sort of IT or network security background before digging in. Although I didn't agree with everything the authors sugested, most of their procesess were right on target. I use the book extensively as a reference in my position as both an investigator and a Security Analyst. It will give the IT professional an appreciative look at security, computer crimes, and legal aspects of performing technical investigative duties. I highly recommend the book, but be wary, it can be difficult to follow at times if your reading straight through. Again, it's a great reference."
1,"You're kidding, right?","After reading the reviews previously posted I was convinced this would be a good purchase. Never have I been so misled. This book is extremely poorly organized and provides very basic introductions to the topics discussed. It's not a book I would suggest to a new information security professional or to someone with several years of security work. The beginner is introduced to only TWO basic concepts in the entire ""Access Control Systems and Methodology"" CISSP domain while the advanced reader is fed a history of biometrics!! This is the tone throughout the book. Not enough organized coverage of basic tenets and a lot of ""...and I care, why?"" theoretical and useless ramblings.Yuck."
3,Book PLUS test software = CISSP,"This book is a compilation of several documents by various authors, and tends to be dry. I read (tried to at least) this book and also did the practice software ... and passed. The book prvoided some good fundamentals, and the software really prepared me...."
4,"Black and white, late 80's style","This book had some great insights and reflections on some good trips, this guy talked me into going on one of these drives. I stopped rading after that. Mine is in pristine condition."
1,Beneath The 12-Mile Reef.,"I have seen this movie many times on TV over the years and have always enjoyed it. Robert Wagner was so young and in his early years of his acting career. When I saw that a DVD was available I felt I had to have it,but this is not the one to buy. It is without a doubt the worst conversion to DVD that I have seen. It is blurry,and washed out in most of the film with lots of scratches running down the picture. It was obviously put together from a bunch of different reels from different copies. I can't blame the seller for this but I wouldn't buy the DVD made by Alpha Video (AP6004D)."
3,underrated early CinemaScope pic,Greek sponge divers run afoul of Florida Key locals for poaching rights in this early CinemaScope picture featuring Robert Wagner and Terry Moore as the young Romero and Juliet between the warring families. Noted mainly for its brilliant underwater photography and superb Bernard Herrmann score. In Technicolor!
1,"NOT A BAD FILM,BUT VERY POOR TRANSFER","LOW QUALITY TRANSFER,SO BLURRY IT WAS HARD TO WATCH(coulden't make it all the way thru.I COULD BARELY TELL WHO THE ACTORS ARE."
2,"Story Good, Picture Quality Weak to Poor","The story of the movie is fine, as other reviewers have pointed out. Unfortunately, this particular product was created from a print of the film (rather than remastered) and it yields very weak picture quality throughout. Blemishes appear with regularity in the picture. There are skips here and there and the color washes out from time to time. I kept the DVD for the soundtrack only - the picture quality just simply is not good."
3,A quick read for a lazy afternoon.,"Robin Digby returned from her Mexican trip to find her apartment occupied by T. J. Swift and to discover that she was believed murdered by her pondscum, good ol' boy ex-husband. Sharing the apartment with the ex-cop and current student, working on T.J.'s paper and reestablishing Robin's life, all brings T.J. and Robin closer together. Then Robin starts investigating the other Robin's life.Very nice tale and good chemistry, but no real depth, even with T.J.'s delayed stress and Robin's self-esteem issues. If you're looking for angst, go elsewhere. If you want an mix of mystery and romance, try again. If you just want a fun afternoon or evening spent with an engaging couple, this is the book for you."
4,Pretty good CF Wi-Fi for an expert user,"I bought this for my Dell Axim X5. I've noticed pretty good peformance, but the documentation and software leave a bit to be desired.The documentation was one sheet of paper folded in half, with no usage instructions at all.The UI for the driver is fairly slow, and the usage is a bit weird. My biggest issue is that it doesn't seem to remember AP names and only allows one WEP setting, so switching between networks is tedious."
3,Will it be a matter of time before its on dvd?!,"Surprised this isn't one of those RARE vhs not available on dvd for a Extremely High price! Worth purchasing at this low price just to see this strange piece of work done by Liza, her father and Ingrid Bergman."
1,War Criminal,"if you want the evil truth about Dr K and how he undermined the 1968 peace talks, read ""No Peace, No Honor: Nixon, Kissinger, and Betrayal in Vietnam"" by Larry Berman.This book explains how Nixon and Kissinger illegally colluded with SVN and Nguyen Van Thieu - he was told by Nixon via Anna Chenault to ""hold on, we are going to win"" and ""you will get a better deal with us"". So Thieu says he won't talk peace, Nixon wins, Kissinger openly changes sides after working with the Democrats, and together they crank up the war.The point is: The War could have ended in 1968 if it were not for this man - Dr Death himself, Henry Adolf Kissinger!"
5,Great knives and a great price,"These knives were built to last! They are made well and look brand-new, even after having been used for months. They are also very easy to work with as they cut quickly and sharply. I will have these for many years to come."
2,"Rust, rust, rust!","I purchased these knives about a month or two ago. I thought, ""Wow, Revere ware at THAT price, what a deal!"" Yeah, right! They began to rust after the FIRST dish washing and the walnut handle is dried out and looks like it will fall apart soon! I am NOT impressed! The only saving grace of this set is the fact that the knives are still sharp! Otherwise I'd trash them...Hmph! I guess I have to get some use out of them..."
2,"Get ""You Can Always Turn Around"" instead","I loved a concert he did in France in summer 2012, and the CD ""You Can Always Turn Around"".I was not taken by Triple Play at all. In fact, I don't think i listened all of it, which is rare. I just did not care for the music, the style... maybe some day it will come, the CD is still around. Lucky has done much progress over the years, as far as i can tell, and ""You Can Always Turn Around"" is much more groovy. I bought 5 of this CD and gave them around as gifts."
5,Excellent Jim Hall album.,"This is one of my favorite Jim Hall albums. Great sound, and great music. Easily a five star album. Highly recommended."
5,Buy This,"When you receive this disc, go to track 4, listen to Desmond and Chet attheir very best, whatever you paid for it, think you will know it was worth it, not often that you hear magic, and Jim Hall ain't all the badeither."
5,Jazz SuperGroup,"This is simply a wonderful jazz recording. I bought the LP when it was first issued many years ago and it is one of my treasures. Really, the artists on ""Concierto"" make up what I consider to be a jazz supergroup. Just imagine if you could see these guys in concert, today...Jim Hall, Chet Baker, Paul Desmond, Roland Hanna and Ron Carter! The mind boggles.I have to rate ""Concierto"" five star because of the wonderful music. The sound is good but, IMHO, it could be better (the vinyl is). I hope someone will reissue the CD using the latest remastering technology.Bottom line...if you like any one of these great jazz virtuosos, you need this CD."
3,Good book. but.....,"I you are a profesional musician or are in the process of becoming one, this book may be for you. In my case, music and performing is more of a hobby,while some of the information was usefull, it was no enough to justifify my buying the book."
4,Great cd,C.G.Brown is great Blues artist! This CD as well as many other are excellent in every way. If you unfamiliar with his music I think you will enjoy this CD and most likley all of CGB's music.
2,Not for the independent learner,"This book was produced and designed for a classroom situation with a teacher, and not for an individual trying to learn the language independently. Despite having some knowledge of spoken Spanish, I had difficulty getting past the first assignment as there is no English translation given. Suppose the authors leave that up to the teacher. Undoubtedly, the language CDs that accompany the course probably would help, but I already have Spanish language tapes and I have no desire to spend another $30+ to find out. These are not included with the text."
2,Not very cheesy or jalapeno-y,"I love Barbara's baked cheese puffs, so I thought I'd give these a try. Much to my disappointment, these were not nearly as cheesy or jalapeno-y as I had hoped. If you're looking for big cheese flavor, the baked puffs are a much better option. Sadly, there's no jalapeno baked version though. :-("
4,"Very Tasty, but doesn't use organic corn","I love these but they aren't made with organic corn and also contain non-organic soy, two ingredients that are usually Genetically Modified. For that reason, I won't be buying these again. (They are very tasty, though)"
2,Confusing..,"These chips are all natural.. great. All natural doesn't mean healthier, but it does feel great to know you're not taking any artificial ingredients inside your stomach.That being said, the chips taste........ meh. At times it's way too bland, but most of the times it's way too salty. It's like there's some imbalance of salt on these cheese puffs. I tried to like these chips, since based off the reviews on here, they're supposed to be superb, but I can't. The jalapeno taste is very mild as well, you'd have to eat a dozen of these puffs before you get the kick of the jalapeno, and even that kick never gets to the true spiciness level of a jalapeno. As for the cheddar and blue cheese flavors, I taste mostly cheddar and a light blue cheese smell... that's it. I would skip on getting these cheese puffs again, but I'll give Barbara's props for being all natural."
1,bad,"The violin was received on time but it doesnot tune at all. have tried several times but its doesnot work.the teacher recommended this was a bad buy.I would like to return the item, but have no contact add or phone number.I would stop buying items in Amazon from now as their after sale service is bad.I have the violin packaging but whom to send, whom to contact?"
3,Good starter instrument,"Interested in violin but don't want to invest a lot just yet? Try out this full-size inexpensive instrument. I'm not an expert on violins but I do know you can get it in tune, keep it in tune, and play it as you would expect of any violin. I suspect for solo or professional use you are going to want something else.I recommend this instrument to persons who think they might be interested in the violin, but are not ready to invest in a professional quality piece just yet."
3,note caveat: this is an unfinished product to assemble,"While the product itself will do for a beginner, I was really disappointed that upon arrival, I discovered that the bridge for all the springs needed to be assembled by sandpaper and/or tightening of the strings into grooves before tightening the strings. To me this violin will do for the basics, but that bridge assembly required to me needed to be in the product description, esp. when shipping costs if more than 25% the cost of the product. While this product is great at this cost, I don't know if I would have purchased it with alternatives if I had known beforehand about the bridge.It felt soooo good bustin this piece of made in China crap jumpin up and down on it, worth the 40 bucks man. fer real. try it!"
3,Sometimes you get slightly better than what you pay for.,"Shipping was prompt and the price was nice and low for a full size violin. Obviously this is a low quality instrument made in china so don't expect it to be amazing. The wood is a nice color and the craftsmanship is not bad. It's certainly not made for kids learning considering it's full size. It works fine for an adult to learn on and as long as you're careful it shouldn't fall apart or anything. Just to comment on some other reviews, the bridge isn't supposed to be glued to the body, most string instrument parts are held in place by the tension of the strings. First of all I'd recommend getting better rosin for this, after I got better rosin it played much better. If you purchase a good set of strings this would also greatly improve the sound. The tuning pegs on it don't work the best so I recommend getting it in the ballpark range with the pegs and then use the fine tuners the rest of the way. Be sure to reset the bridge after tuning."
1,Just... awful...,"Where to begin.It smells, it is beyond ugly, plays like a nightmare, the string spacing is sloppily done, the ""finish"" is not finished (cuts out just below the head. Nothing about it is good. I took it to my instrument technician and he said it would cost about $80 to get it playable. More than this P.O.S. cost plus shipping. Pass this one up. It is not worth it. At all. I firmly believe that these reviews are fabricated by the seller, because if anybody truly believes that this violin is beautiful, they need to see an eye doctor. This thing is disgusting."
1,Disappointed,"I ordered 3 of these violins in various sizes for myself and my two daughters. One arrived with a broken tuner. The company did replace it but more started to break. Our violin teacher was not happy with quality and we were not able to keep any of the three violins in tune for longer than an hour even a month post purchase. When I tried to return the 3 sub-par violins, this company would not accept returns since it was after 14 days. I am disappointed and would not recommend this purchase to anyone."
3,"wets whistle, fun","Ordered for or 18 year old, i thought it was entertaining. however there were no nude scenes and son lost interest, quickly. P.S. I had read ahead of time there were no nude scenes, and that it was rated for 16+ age group. so I was not to concerned with content, and it shows you around the mansion, that I had always heard about in my youth. plus its in animation, rather than the E show "" The girls next Door"""
2,It's okay for a mild diversion.,"It's okay I suppose for a diversion but boring after a while. The scenes are repetitive, the censoring blurs can't be changed which kind of defeats the purpose of some of the party scenes.Building the empire seems to be fairly simple in concept and after a while that gets boring because there isn't anything different from magazine to magazine."
1,less than bad,"tony romanello is a good guy.the rest is junk, except for that drummer from degage with the mountain man hair.that guy rules."
2,A dissapointment,"What the world needs is an ""American Masters"" or Ken Burns like documentary about Ruth St. Denis, Ted Shawn and the Denishawn Dance Company (who at times included such key figures as Martha Graham, Charles Weideman, Doris Humphrey, and the silent film star Louise Brooks). Together, and as individuals, they left an indelible mark on American dance and culture. They were spiritual, mystical, modern, groundbreaking, sensual and even at times erotic. Dissapointingly, this short film only scratches the surface of their incredible story. The vintage images and film clips are the main attraction."
3,Informative but Disappointing,"Great for a history of Denishawn. This DVD includes restages of the dances that were created by Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn, but I felt I was missing out on the essence of these dances because they were not performed by the founders themselves. It is a DVD made as well as possible as it could have been made at the time, it just leaves you wishing they had made it much earlier while the actual poeple were still alive."
5,"Good movie, not original Denishawn though","This is the current Denishawn group, for some reason I expected to see Ruth St Denis and Ted Shawn....But they had a good training program and so it is worth it"
5,An Amazing Runner,"As a high schooler who ran cross-country and track Pre was an inspiration. I learned about him around those times. I even cut out a picture of him in a magazine and put it over my bed as an inspiration before every track meet I competed in. This documentary must be real good!! It's a must for any track enthusiast, runner, or any Pre fans. He was an inspiration. If he had lived he probably would have been one of the greatest track coaches of all time like Bill Bowerman was. He's in my top 10 of one of the greatest track stars of all time! What A Runner!!! Thanks."
4,Prefontaine Documentary comes to video,"If you love Prefontaine and Without Limits, this is a must see"
5,LOVE IT!,even though it dosent have special sections. there is a lot of wonderful insite on this home town hero.
4,Great Runumentary......,"Hey Yall.I had just got finished reading ""Bowerman and the Men of Oregon"". This was a great suppliment to the Prefontaine chapter. I had watched: Pre and found this to be a better installment, due to the fact it is not hollywoodized. Prefontaine in the flesh. You gotta appreciate the legacy he started with the AAU, and Nike. Pre still lives!!!!"
4,Cool documentary,Interesting look back at Pre. Great to have some more race footage although it could always have more.
5,Pre!,"If you were a runner in the early '70s, Steve Prefontaine was your idol. Give Frank Shorter and Bill Rodgers and even Lasse Viren their due, it was Pre who captured the essence of running as no other ever had or probably ever will. The guy had charisma - loads of it - and a style that grabbed you by the shorts and pulled you around the track with him. Was he America's greatest runner? Probably not, but who knows how good he could have been had his awesome potential not been snuffed. He may not have been the best, but he certainly inspired more runners than any of his contemporaries. The video provides comments and insights from family, friends and athletic rivals, and the footage from some of his races - particularly the 1972 Olympic 5000 meters - is an adrenaline-pumping reminisce of a spirit in American running we may never see again. This video allows the viewer to vicariously experience that fire and magic one more time."
3,Just so you know...,"""One of the most powerful men in Washington, D.C., dashing Matt Tynan had a direct line to the president and never lacked for beautiful escorts to diplomatic dinners and party fund-raisers. But his life took a perilous turn when his investigation into buried CIA Project Code Proteus turned up explosive information pointing to an inside cover-up. He'd already embroiled his secretary, Carey Benton, and it was up to him to keep her safe. But getting close to the Kansas-born beauty wreaked havoc on his tightly controlled emotions. Keeping cool had always been his game, but the rules had suddenly, dangerously changed for good...""This is from the back cover."
1,Don't waste your money!!!!,"I purchased this set because it seemed like a good price for Revere knives, BUT after using them twice the blades became rusty and pitted. I know this was not an expensive set but they are unusable. I called Revere and they advised me they did not make this product, in fact it had been manufactured by another company and used their name. As of this writing I am still attempting to get a reponse from this other company. Do not buy this product."
1,less than overwhelmed,"So, they send me the wrong movie, I call to explain and they say that the movie I wanted is out of stock and they wont have it at any known time..They refunded me and let me keep the other movie which was nice but why would they have the title for sale if they dont have it anyway? i was angry.But, I was impressed with how they handled the situation"
3,Pretty good movie with some good Wing Chun scenes,"I bought this DVD for one reason and one reason only: because I'd heard that it had the Wing Chun fighting style in it.Over all, it wasn't a bad movie. However it seemed a little dated; the production quality seems to be similar to the cheap Kung Fu movies I used to watch on Saturday afternoon years ago on TV: bad overdubs, etc. However I did like the fact that there was some Wing Chun in the movie and for that reason I'm glad I bought it. It would be nice though if someone would release a better produced, more modern movie that emphasized the Wing Chun style."
1,overated,"After reading all the user reviews I was hyped up to watch this movie, only to be disapointed. The action scenes are good but far from great. The movie doesn't take itself seriously. It's loaded with Japanese commedy that just doesn't work for an American culture. The characters have weak personalities, making none of them memorable. As a DVD it's setup great, but it's not worth buying, renting yes."
3,Another excellent Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao Kung-Fu Flick,"I was surprised when I saw The Prodigal Son. It was a lot different than I thought it would be. Although Sammo's scenes are great, they're small. Yuen Biao's final fighting scene is fun to watch. The big problem was that you spend most of the film wondering whether you should hate Ching-Ying Lam for not teaching Yuen, or hate Yuen for being such a pest. An original plot, loads of Kung-Fu, and some interesting characters, make The Prodigal Son a film to see."
4,Very Good,The movie was very good. The story line and the characters are great. The fight scenes are excellent! Sammo Hung is one of the absolutes best in the business. They explain some basic points of the fighting techniques used in the film. There is lots of action! This is a must have for any fan of the martial arts movie genre.The movie I received however was not dubbed in English. This is unfortunate because many people prefer to watch the entire movie without having to look away from the main view in order to read the English sub-titles. There is an English dub version available. I liked the movie so much that I think I will purchase the English dub version as well. Maybe someone will buy mine for a cheaper price.
3,"Old ""Skool"" Kung Fu!!","My second flick with Yuen Biao, ( Knockabout) and he's o.k!! I enjoyed this one,,,however, I think this flick is grossly over rated!!After really all the great reviews and seeing all the 4 and 5 stars, I was sufficiently convinced it has to be a gem,,,I duly dissagree with that synopsis!! However, it's an acceptable old school kung fu performance,,,the dvd transfer amazing! However, it was Sammo Hung who sold this one for me!!"
5,One of the Best films of the Genre,Director Sammo Hung creates a story of Chinese folklore hero Leung Chang played by Yuen Biao(phonetically= Beau).It portrays Leung Chang as rich spoiled kid who thinks he knows how to fight. People actually get paid to get beat up by him.He meets a peking opera star Leung Yee Tai played by Lam Chi Ying. Leung Yee tells him that he can't fight and has his butt handed to him. Leung Chang then wants to be taught how to fight by Leung Yee.Anyone who wants to start a collection of Kung Fu DVD's should consider buying this. Prodigal Son is always in a top 10 of the genre. The Action is non-stop and the story is very good. Go check it out.
4,"Great Gong Fu, Great Actors, Well Written 4.65","Its rare that I come across a kung fu movie all my friends can sit down and watch. Although I don't mind the grainy quality and charmingly cheesy dubbings of most ol' gong fu... this copy is really well done; it adds to the movie. Besides good quality, the actors are serious powerhouses and the kung fu par excellence (is that right?). The movie's somewhat predictable plot is pumped up with some old fashion shocking scenes that kung fu should be better known for (if you like these movies- you know what i mean)."
5,The conflicts & challenges to great artist.,The first short story [there are two in this book] is 22 pages filled with the challenges & conflicts faced by anyone who aspires to fame in the visual arts. The struggle is timeless. Readers should know beforehand that of the three artist only Frenhaufer is fictional -- Poussin & Porbus were actually living at the time of the action -- though Balzac changes their ages & -- for Porbus -- his status at that time. Fact & fiction are skillfully woven into an art form which has been utilized by so many writers. The introduction to the book gives a short history of that period in art history. Knowledge of Balzac's life experiences & writing habits adds greatly to the reader's appreciation.In the second short story Balzac again tries to relate the struggles of artist -- though he uses the performing arts for his subject.B. Joan Wragg
3,Was this an unknown masterpiece?,"I wasn't quite able to get the full meaning of what the painter Frenhofer was trying to paint, but I can guess it was beautiful, and yet it turned out wrong. I guess I read too fast. Balzac was accurate in his names, though, with Pourbus, Mabuse, and Nicolas Poussin.................."
5,A Great Jazz Album,I have owned this disc since its original release on vinyl in the mid-70's. It still sounds as impressive today as it did then. The musicians are all tops in their field and the performances are simply brilliant. I have listened to this album over 200 times in my life and it still sounds great and fresh.
5,The Hubert Laws recording to get,"I'm a professional musician, a flutist and saxophonist by trade. Hubert Laws was a seminal influence on me back in the '70's but as with many of the things that interested us as young men or women, I kind of lost track of his work. He left me really cold and disappointed when he moved over to Columbia and started chasing mega-success. Imagine my surprise when I rediscovered In The Beginning in its snappy new single cd release, complete with the remarkable, original CTI artwork. I bought it and played it with trepidation the first time. But, I'm happy to say that my trepidation was unfounded: Hubert Laws really was that good in the 1970's. Welcome ""back"", Hubert! So everyone, just buy it - it's the bomb."
3,Evocative jazz for the non-jazzy,"I'll admit it -- jazz is not my area of expertise. But one day, as the laundry was laundering and I had the satellite TV set to the digital music channels, I came across an immediately gripping sound. The ID at the bottom left corner of the screen named this artist and disc, and I jotted it down. When I finally ordered it, all I remembered about it was that its flute had reminded me of The Animals' ""Spill The Wine."" Listening to it, I am transported to some sort of timeless otherworld. Laws' plays his flute like Jimi played guitar. That is to say, with abandon and a supreme confidence that his explorations are nothing but a dance with the Muse, simply a sound of joy and grit and ethereal magic for which he is a vessel. Put this on and let it envelope you. Its timeless wash of blue-shaded jazz lives somewhere near Getz and Gilberto, albeit with more soul. The three stars reflects my ignorance of the genre...I'm unsure whether this is ""good jazz,"" but I know I like it."
3,Sweep Over My Soul,I lkied it but it was not enough of what I have come to expect from Luciano. His usual rocking riffs were not in most of the selections. This is more of a somber sit down and listen CD rather than a play it at a party CD.
4,"Good price, nice coat.","Good price, nice coat. My dog usually wears a large but a large in this was too long on him."

2,Nice decoration,"I got this for my wife she is collecting Le Creuset pans for us to cook with. There really is no point to having this thing unless you had a few of them so you could make small dishes with them like a ramekin. But for the price of one you can get a whole set of those so think twice before spending the money on this, mine just ends up sitting on the counter for decoration."
3,Cute and Small,"I really liked the cocotte, but the whole bottom part was in pieces when I received it. It was in the box with the other items I purchased with no packing material. The good thing was amazon gave me a full refund."
2,Loved it.. But Fragile!!,"I dropped the lid just right over the bowl, and I do mean right above it.. and the entire handle broke off from the bowl.. I love their other items, but this is a bit too fragile, especially for the price!"
4,Le Creuset,Beautiful product. Great quality and rich looking. Great for making mini casseroles or for salsa or dips.
2,Dissappointed in the craftsmanship and shipping..,"I bought 4 of these.. in a variety of colors. They are perfect for individual serves of gratin potatoes, french onion soup.. and they stood up well in the oven and under the broiler.Problems that I had were two of the four ended up with side handles broken during shipping. I had replacements.. but guess what.. another broken one too! They are more fragile than you might think and I did not appreciate that quality. I expected them to be a bit heartier for the price. Blah!"
4,Some Beautiful Composition,"As a student of photography I loved this book. Given the conditions under which many of the photographs were taken, the composition of some of these images is amazing. If you love natural light, black and white photography, as I do, I definitely recommend taking a look at this book - the exhibition is even better."
1,Collection of Posed Propaganda Photos,"This book is a collection of posed propaganda photos by the same people that brought you reeducation camps and inspired millions of their fellow citizens to flee abroad.I can't believe anyone is gullible enough to believe that all but a handful of these photos were anything but posed propaganda. You see ""combat"" photos with soldiers in spotless uniforms, clean faces and purposeful (but never frightened) expressions. I suppose the editors just couldn't pass up an opportunity to denigrate the U.S./South Vietnam War effort.If you want to know about real life in Vietnam and how the war influenced it I suggest you read something by Duong Thu Huong instead of spending your money on this silliness"
1,Save your money!,"As a photographer, I found a number of striking images that were certainly taken under difficult circumstances. Also from the historical record standpoint, it was very interesting to see the photos of the good life on the Ho Chi Minh trail.However as a Vietnam veteran (Navy physician with the Marines 1966-1967), I was definitely turned off by the propaganda images and the inaccuracies and tone of some of the captions. Jane Fonda cavorting with smiling North Vietnamese was a little hard to take.The classic VC female shots with weapon in hand were right off of Communist leaflets and similar portrayals can be found in North Vietnamese stamps of that era.I would take a look at this book in the library or in a bookstore but I would not buy it."
5,Wonderful Long Journey,"""I realized pretty soon that I have to do more than just play bass in the background way. So, I developed a kind of playing which only a handful of musicians accepted.""So said Weber indicating the amazing long journey of one of a kind musicians.This recording is an honoring of this amazing talent.Shortly after this Weber had a stroke which he is slowly recovering from.I highly recommend searching out all you can about this man and his work."
1,Piece of crap,Do not buy this....It does not even fly...it broke the first time I tried to use it...it doesn't have enough lift power to keep it in flight.
1,Overpriced piece of junk,This plane is made of styrofoam. I paid $60 plus $11 S&H and on its first flight crashed and broke. It is flimsy and not air worthy. I expected more than a pice of styrofoam and cardstock for this plane and for the cost. I will say the vendor did ship another model but it too is part styrofoam and broke to piece on its first flight. I would not buy this again.
4,Nice for the Price,"This flag is very nice quality for the price, and the flag is all one could hope for.Two problems I have, however, are the fold lines you get (the flag comes folded) and the fact that for some reason my flag wants to bend to the right near the bottom. The first problem is easily solved by ironing (after putting a towel on top of course), and the second isn't really noticeable."
5,as a socialist,paid 99cents! came out to be 2.99 (w.shipping) us commies dont like to pay alot on anything got here in 2 days!!! maybe it was luck but wow! awesome quality... great if youre gonna pin it up on a wall (because its a bit see through if light hits it) DO NOT HANG OUTSIDE!!! its good to hang in a room or if youre attending a SOCIALIST/COMMUNIST protest... LIBERTY JUSTIC AND EQUALITY!!! WORKERS OF THE WORLD UNITE!!!
5,Its a flag.,"Its the U.S.S.R. flag. you get what you pay for. It hangs in my college apartment and i enjoy its company. in soviet Russia, Flag enjoys your company!"
4,Nice,"I ordered this flag along with one other on the 27th and they both arrived on the 29th. It has decent quality, perfectly fine if you're just going to be hanging it in your basement, but I would not recommend it if you're planning on flying it outdoors for more than a reenactment or something. The colors are really nice, but I do have one complaint: there's a very small (maybe a millimeter wide x 3/4 inch long) red line on the sickle. Slightly disappointing, though nothing to cry over. For the price it's a great flag."
3,Some cosmetic flaws,"You get what you paid for. The flag is nice for the amount you spend on it, but it could be better. The sickle protrudes too far, and the flag has the appearance of viewing it from the ground as it flies from a flagpoles, but with it draping a table."
2,Quality issues with Kindle format!,"I was incredibly disappointed with the quality of the download. The formatting at the beginning of at least two chapters is completely off. Furthermore, who creates a collection of short stories that does not include a table of contents? Returned!"
5,Classic Jazz album,"It's a classic and beautiful jazz album. If you love jazz, you should have this one as part of your collection."
5,Time with Dave Brubeck,I have had this CD on my wish list for some time and I am thrilled to finally have it in my collection. The sound quality and packaging are top quality and the music is superb! I highly recommend this to any music lover.
5,A jazz classic,"I have to agree that this is one of the most accessible jazz albums ever. Even people who profess to dislike jazz, like ""Blue Rondo"" and ""Take Five"". It was a groundbreaking album, never meant or expected to become the hit it was. It was done as an experiment in odd-meters. I won't pretend to know anything about what that means exactly, I am no musician, but I do know what I like. And this album is one of my all time favourites, be it jazz or otherwise. Some reviewers have said that it is overrated. But how can you overrate something that is so wonderful and a work of art? This is an album that should belong in every home. The 16 page booklet includes the original liner notes, tons of photos and an essay by Dave Brubeck himself."
5,Excellent!!!!,"I received the super-aduio format of this CD for Christmas and initially was only mildy impressed. Dave Brubeck, is of course, a formidable jazz artist whose ""Take Five"" is positively essential for budding jazz artists.We had just upgraded our stereo system which now plays the super audio CDs. To say I was floored is a masterpiece of understatement.The sound is quite simply phenomenal. Moreover, while this was released in the early 60s, the material here is timeless and beautifully performed. This is an excellent reminder of the caliber of musicianship that was Dave Brubeck's. This set is filled with rapturous piano performances that jazz aficianados will readily and eternally appreciate!I HIGHLY recommend!!!!"
4,Help Me Rhondo,"An excellent version of ""Blue Rhondo A La Turk,"" the classic ""Take Five,"" and a complete indifference to pseudo-intellectual modern critics who don't think TIME OUT is bluesy enough make this one of my favorite jazz records, ever.I won't go into the details on time changes--there are plenty of other reviews here that do that, if you're interested--but I will say I find it endlessly fascinating that all those exotic times sound just plain swingin'."
5,A jazz landmark,"A lot of people must have approached ""Time Out"" with great suspicion on its release: a ""cold"" jazz pianist leading a quartet in odd tempos. What could be more squaresville than that? But Dave Brubeck was so inspired in the conception that it could not fail; if breaking jazz out of the 4-4 trap ultimately led the music down cul-de-sacs it was worth it for the sublime melodies and brilliant use of rhythm. It didn't hurt to have first-rank players, especially Paul Desmond, who if he owed a lot to Stan Getz made his own mark with his understated, smooth, supremely eloquent approach to the sax.One of the all time great recordings, excellently remastered, and a must for any music lover."
5,No CD collection is complete without it! One of the best!,"Even though, I've been a fan of Dave Brubeck Quartet for many years, I've never really been comfortable with him as a pianist at times. He plays sometimes like he's angry, playing those big heavy block chords. It balances out with Paul Desmond's dreamlike, light alto sax. My favorites are when Brubeck does calm down a bit and plays beautiful rubato as in ""Strange Meadow Lark"" and the lilting, poignant and gorgeous ""Kathy's Waltz"". Desmond steals the show however. His playing is heavenly, light and dreamlike. Each cut is outstanding. There are time explorations like 5/4, 6/8 etc. Take Five is now so familiar it sounds like music for a commercial, but don't be fooled, it is a great piece of innovative music. Joe Morello on drums is off the wall and insanely good. Eugene Wright applies the syrup with his steady bass. Enough said. One of the greatest jazz releases ever. Essential to any collection!"
4,Excellent and timeless album,"I recently came across this album on LP and thoroughly enjoyed it. When I saw the CD version, I had to grab it. Creative, each song a winner. Four star rating due to the remastering, not quite as consistant as the LP. Background hiss changes volume as soloists join/leave. Great despite!"
5,Essential,"I have heard ""take five"" covered by a thousand different people. This is the original and by far the best. The sound on the remaster is so full you feel like you are in the studio with them. You don't have to be a jazz lover to love this CD. This is just great music and essential listening."
2,Great Music bad disk,"I bought this disk as a cheap backup to my SACD version but sadly, the pressing is, apparently, defective.The top track on this disk is garbled. No scratches just garbled recording as in a bad pressing. No visible defect but the same track won't play properly on any of my CD, SACD or DVD players."
3,"Interesting, if not always soulful","This album begins with an intriguing concept of exploring the possibilities beyond 4/4 and the occasional waltz in jazz, and proceeds to take several runs as the prospect. Of the two stand out tracks, Blue Rondo A La Turk is interesting because of the compound meter and the successful use of the overarching crescendo. Take 5 is even more interesting because it actually sounds like a fully realized piece rather than a deliberate sketch where they're trying to write in new meters rather than happening to have ideas in new meters (this is an important distinction). Not enough has been written about Paul Desmond's masterful playing on all tracks, especially Take 5 (his own composition). He's the real standout instrumentalist here. If you like the approach to classicism in this album, John Lewis from the Modern Jazz Quartet is a superb, understated pianist and an excellent writer who deserves much more widespread name recognition."
4,Unusual combination of rhythm and melody,"I'm new to Jazz, and have been mainly listening to Classical and Pop music. This album is very good for Jazz beginners, and extremely good exposure for Classical listeners. It doesn't follow the usual music timing, but the mix and match is done very well. Melody on 3 of the songs is fantastic: ""Take Five"", ""Three to get ready"" and ""Kathy's Waltz"". You can really tap your way through a mundane chore listening to it.The length of time for this album is short though, but considering this a Classic Jazz album, I feel it's sufficient for the money I paid."
4,good stuff,oldie but goodie. Brought back many great memories of Brubeck with great quality sounds and arrangements. Would by more Brubeck.
3,Time Out by Dave Brubeck,"Dear Amazon. I have generally been quite pleased with the books and music that you or your affiliates have sent. However, the Time Out CD seemed just a wee bit too fast. I listened to it many many times as an album, it was the signature music of my later teenage years. May I exchange it? Thank you, Grace Clark"
2,Grandpas Don't Want to Have Fun,"I steered clear from this album for a long time because I was afraid it would sound like white dudes playing jazz. I was wrong. It sounds like OLD white dudes playing jazz. The only worthwhile song is ""Take Five"" and it's likely due to the fact that it's the one tune not composed by Brubeck. Simple, over-polished Snoresville. Music as toothless as the denture-wearing men performing it."
2,Re: If Jesus Liked Jazz,"A fine jazz album for people who are not sure if they like jazz. The music is pleasing without being offensive, or particularly moving. Sure it is a fine place to start, but one would hope that a person's tastes would deepen quickly. I always had a suspicion that this album was rediculously over-rated, and seeing the reviews here confirm my feelings. It's a good pop jazz album, not as swinging or interesting as anything else back then, and a bit dated now. One reviewer said ""take out your Kenny G and put this in,"" I am sure it was meant as some kind of slam on Kenny G, but it seems like a fair estimation on the impact this record has had on jazz. I am sure that Jesus likes Mingus more."
1,Caution: Format,"I know this album very well since I have the original which was released in the early 60s, but I don't want to play it and accelerate it's deterioration. In my current state of techno ignorance, however, I did not realize this format (SACD) was not compatible with my CD player. I will definitely buy the correct format CD of this album since it is a unique and classic example of that era's jazz and an overall wonderful performance by an outstanding artist."
1,Pretentious with a capital Boring!,YAWWWWWWWWN! I think I'll go watch paint dry instead. Or water boil. Either one is preferable than going stark raving mad listening to this dreck.
5,MUST HAVE JAZZ CD,"Dave Brubeck's Time Out is a great classic whose appeal has stood and will continue to stand the test of time. I'm not a jazz afficionado or hep cat, but I dig all the tunes from this 1959 release, just as I already did those of Miles Davis' all-time classic from the same year, Kind of Blue.In my opinion, Time Out and Kind of Blue are the essential jazz releases. You can build your jazz collection to complement them, but you cannot truly add anything in terms of quality.Time Out is a most pleasant work for those who have had a stressful day. A mellow yet upbeat pace is prevalent throughout, as was well commercialized and publicized in the million-selling single off the album, Take Five.A few years ago, I reviewed Elvis Presley's Back in Memphis as one very soulful and relaxing CD. On a parallel note, I can assure you that Time Out is unequivocally a very soothing and jazzy contribution to the world of music."
5,Coolest of the cool,"So I'm sitting here listening to Take Five for the hundreth time (you know, the one you hear in the Infiniti commercials), and I'm thinking...this is one of the greatest albums I've ever heard, period! Buy it...all of your friends will recognize it when they hear it, you'll never grow tired of this album, and it's the type of music appropriate for any occassion. Slam dunk, daddy-o, COOL!"
5,Best Jazz Album Ever Made,"This is the greatest and most influentual jazz album ever released. The quartet was never better in 1959 when they released Time Out. Dave Brubeck is a very talented pianist, and along with Paul Desmond's incredible airy tone, self-described as a dry martini, Joe Morello's fluency in odd times signatures, shown on Take Five in 5/4 and Blue Rondo A La Turk in 9/8, and Eugene Wright on double bass. From start to finish this album is filled with classics. I highly recommend this album along with The Essential Dave Brubeck 2 disc set."
5,Brubeck Masterpiece,"The Dave Brubeck Quartet / Time Out: ""Take Five"" is the great hit on this album but the whole album is a Masterpiece and ""Take Five"" becomes even better when heard in the context of the album. This one deserves a Sixth Star."
1,best_bargain_books3,"I was advised by Amazon.com to leave feedback in regards to the seller ""best_bargain_books3"" at this location due to my not having the ability to leave feedback because I never received the book that I ordered from them. Beware....Beware....they do have the book and you only find out after a period of time.....beware"
3,Not Classic Night Ranger,"As a true Night Ranger fan, I like to use 7 Wishes as a bench mark because I believe 7 Wishes was their finest album. Having said that, in their more recent efforts including Seven and Neverland the band has diverged slightly and not always to great affect. If you are a die hard you'll like it, but I'd make sure your collection includes Man In Motion first, a truly superb effort often overlooked."
1,What are you guys listening to?,"I bought this CD based on Night Ranger's older releases and the reviews posted here. Let's see... five great reviews and five members in the band, (kinda makes you wonder). I had to look at the CD itself to make sure the record company didn't make a mistake. This stuff sounds like hopped up country music. The vocals are really terrible. Unless you're a big fan of Buck Owens and the Buckaroos, you might want to leave this CD alone. They should have named it ""NeverAgain"""
4,one of their best!!,IF you're trying to decide on which new release to buy from these guys choose this one over seven. Even though this band has never done anything even mediocre this one shines!! I even think 'feeding off the mojo' is wonderful!!
5,Great Reunion Album,"I was so pleased to see that Night Ranger hadn't gotten back together to put a new album together together, that the day it was released it was in my hot little hands. The opening track of ""Forever All Over Again"" is a ballad that is very well done. They usually say that the opening track sends the mood to the album but that isn't the case here. The album is very 90's rock yet, with a pich of the old Night Ranger feel. I was able to just see Night Ranger back in February and was very bothered that they did not bother to play any of these songs. Both Jeff & Brad play some beautiful guitars. Jack Blades and Kelly Keagy still have their voices, almost as if it was still 1983 and listening to ""Midnight Madness""."
2,Not my favorite. See what you think.,"I didn't care for this book. It made boys seem superior to girls. Also, it seemed to just drag along. I only kind of liked one part because it made me chuckle. That's why I gave it 2 stars instead of one. But, this is just my opinion. Check it out and see what you think."
2,Defective product,"I purchased this as a gift. The velvet insert that holds the cologn in place in the box was broken to bits. The colgn was fine, but it made a very sorry gift presentation. I had no time to send it back as it was a gift. Huge dissapointment. The box even looked worn."
3,Don't waste the money,"1st time out shot it 6 times and the retrieval line came off the spear. The spear went into a crack with the fish. Not much reach at all. I you're a beginner and looking for something to start with, save your money and go with something with two bands. Make sure the line is tied to the spear really well..."
3,Authors?,"Is this the same book? Different authors. From the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press homepage:Translational Control Monograph 30Edited by John W. B. Hershey, University of California, Davis; Michael B. Mathews, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory; Nahum Sonenberg, McGill University, Montreal"
1,Foreign Legions,One of rare works of science fiction that just could not hold my interest. I never finished it.
1,"To me, it was completely boring.",I expected the correspondence between Fitzgerald and his editor to be enlightening and provocative.It was no more exciting than reading notes to the grocer.
4,Beauty is short lived?,"This fragrance is beautiful and unique. I've never smelled anything like it although one might classified it as an oriental type. A perfectly balanced scent; not too sweet, green or citrusy; not to heavy or strong although it's not shy either. Love it! On the other hand, the staying power is nill needing reapplication every one or two hours. Perhapes it's my body chemistry and may react differently on you. That said, I highly recommend that you buy a small bottle in order to try this wonderful perfume."
4,Informative if imperfect,"This collection of George Will columns from 1990-1994 is worth reading, but it falls a bit short of his 1986-1990 predecessor (SUDDENLY) due to his increasing partisanship. Will usually has a firm grasp of the facts, and his columns remind us of the themes of the early 1990's (George Bush Sr., Bill Clinton, Ross Perot, Gulf War, etc.). For these reasons this book is clearly worth reading. But Will loses some of his edge with his relentless knocks against President Clinton, and by endorsing fads like term limits. Still, these are informative columns, written by one not afraid to criticize friends or praise opponents. As a thinking conservative, Will is no screeching fool like Coulter, Limbaugh, or others that that twist facts, invent statistics, and slander dissenters. Thoughtful readers may often disagree with Will, but they'll usually learn something from his columns."
2,"Looks great, but...","After about a half hour of checking this player out I had a couple of problems. First, I plugged it into my PC (Windows XP Pro) and it did show up as an external drive, but I was unable to drag and drop songs onto it. I only received an error notice. I then installed the software and suddenly my computer would no longer even recognize the player was attached to it. Then the LCD started freaking out and displaying weird gray lines instead of what it is supposed to show when it is connecting to the PC.I had also tried the radio before doing all this and it was very poor as most of the ones that come built into an mp3 player are.Bottom line: I'll be taking it back today and getting a different brand."
4,Very good value - and easy to use!!!,"The amount of memory that you get for the cost is great... along with a FM \ AM tuner it can't beat it--- ! I have no trouble with the software as some of the reviews stated, yet I find Windows Media player be a easier, less complicated way to manage the music files than the software included.The tuner does't get great reception_ my only gripe.I reccomend this MP3 player!"
4,A good MP3 player.,"I totally disagree with the other consumer. A year ago (Christmas 02) I got one, and it costed $200. It was a Rio Sport and contained 128MB with an FM Tuner, and a MMC Card Slot (MMC Cards are those little disks that give the MP3 player more MB for more music). This October (2003), i purchased one for my sister's birthday and I came across this one. Over $100 less than the one I got last year, with the exact same insides. The sound quality is good. For people on a budget or dont want to spend alot of money, this, I recommend. (128MB=about 30 songs)"
3,decent but you get what you pay for,"For the price-- I was attracted to the ease of use for sports (armband and stopwatch function) and the AM/FM tuner. Overall, the unit 'works' and I use it but it feels a little cheap and the tuner only works in areas where signals are very strong.Also, the headphones are iffy-- I had a nice pair of Sony's already and use those. If price is a factor and you want something to use for sports/working out AND a tuner to use in strong signal areas, it's not a bad choice. Otherwise spend more or give up a couple features for a brand with better overall quality."
1,Do NOT buy this product!!!!,"This product is a rip-off!! The radio does not work at all hardly- and when it does you have to keep moving it torward the direction of a radio tower! This means that you can not put it in your pocket while listening to it! The directions to working this mp3 suck! They tell you to do something and it doesn't work, when I finally got into the file and put a song on my mp3, it wouldn't play. I have yet to get this to work and I plan on returning it and getting the RIO 128MB instead. Not to mention the support that you call in for is not toll free, and costs a buncle to get help, it would be easier just to return the stupid thing and get a better product! In conclusion- DO NOT BUY MEMOREX MP3!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Not a Good Buy,I recently bought this after I had two RCA Lyras break on me. I bought this product because it looked like it was a good product. It turned out to be a poor purchese. About two days after I got it it stopped working. I am taking it back and not getting another Mp3 player for a while. The tecnology is just not there yet for Mp3 players to be a good purcase.
1,Does not work with Napster,I purchased this to use with Napster and was told by the sales man that there would be now problem with it. Purchased a couple of songs from Napster and guess what they do not work. My husband who is senior network analyst spent many hours to get the songs to work and could not get them to work. I am now going to buy the rio online at target because it says it is compatible with Napster. Wish me luck!
3,Pretty Good Player,"I got this mp3 player for christmas and i have to say that it has served its purpose so far. At first i wanted to get the virgin player but once i found out that i wont need that much memory i opted out of for the biomorph. The 126mb was good enough for me because i listen to the same 20 songs for about a month untill i change them anyway. But, for others you can add addtional memory. The directions will fool for about a day but in all actuality it installs itself. Some down falls are the accesorries, the head-pieces are too big and it doesnt get that loud, the case is shabby and so is the armband. Also, after a day and a half you will find yourself changing the aaa battery. Overall, its a pretty good player."
4,Pretty good for the money!,"I bought this on EBay for a total of $68 including shipping. It's very light so that may be why others gave a low rating - it just doesn't feel worth the $99 (actual price). I read the advice of others and didn't install the software. I just plugged the USB in and it recognized the item as a removable drive. All I did after that was drag and drop my songs in to the removable drive window and that was it! Found that after 23 songs it was full but I have a few cards at home to put in the slot to increase the memory. Pluses - Lightweight, came with arm band, easy to program/use. You CAN use the stopwatch along with the MP3 playback. Minuses - Clip that holds the battery in place looks very fragile, cannot program songs, cheesy case. Overall, I am quite happy with the purchase. At least I don't have to carry my CD player in my hand while running to keep it from skipping!"
1,good if you like disposable players,"I read the reviews and decided to try this player since it was on sale for $88. At first it worked out fine, although I would have to agree that setting FM station presets is a pain. The sound was just as good as my previous Rio 600. However, I found that it had problems randomly playing WMA files--it seemed to choose about six songs and just play those. Once I switched to mp3's I had no problems. But that lasted only another 4 or 5 excercise sessions--the last two times I used it, it wouldn't turn off, and I had to release the battery to get it to shut off. Now it doesn't start at all (and yes, I did have fresh batteries). After trying Memorex's wonderful *cough, cough* tech support and nothing working, I'm going to return this hunk of junk and get another Rio."
3,Not so simple,"The price on this mp3 player was excellent, however, in terms of ease of use, it was quite a headache. Once you manage to get it operating, you should enjoy it, but it took awhile and a few calls to the customer service number for me to transfer music to it. The manual that comes with it is useless."
1,Don't buy this Mp3 player!!!!!,"This mp3 player sucks. No wonder it is so cheap. Today was my first day with it and it screwed up on me. The instructions on the thing are confusing and you have a hard time getting the thing to connect to your computer so you can download songs. It tells you to ""reformat"" the mp3 thing and I did exactly what it told me to do to reformat it and it gave me an error message the next time I powered it on and it shut down. Now it won't stay on. My advice YOU should TAKE: DO NOT BUY THIS MP3 PLAYER!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,I would rate this MP3 player as Poor,"I have used this player a couple of years. I have had these issues with this player:- Select switch broke off.- Specs say upgradeable to 512MB, but if you use a 256MB SD or MMC card, you only have about 10 minutes of battery life. They don't tell you this before you buy.- Battery connection is not secure. If the player is jostled a bit, it will loose power.- Poor quality earphones.- This player has destroyed two memory cards. Memorex technical support denies that there are problems with this player that can destroy memory cards and refuses to replace them.I have stuck with this player because I didn't want to sink more money into MP3 players. This was my first mistake - this player was cheaper than other players and I got what I paid for. I will be in the market for a new MP3 soon and I think I will invest more for a decent player. Memorex won't be considered."
1,No DRM compatibility?? Give Me a Break,"I purchased my Memorex player a few days ago. First the pros to the item. The quality of the music is very good. That's it. Now the cons. The absolute worst thing about this item is that it does not play DRM wma files. In other words it doesn't play songs that you download legally from Napster, I-tunes, etc. This is absolutely ridiculous. Another is that the loading of the songs takes too long. Also the earphones are very ackward and cause pain to the ears if kept in to long. I took it back after having it for 2 days. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this player. Spend another 40 bucks and go with a RIO. Which by the way is a great player."
3,"This is a board book for toddlers, kindergarten","I am actually going to return this book as I bought it for a nine year old and it is really a board book for a much younger child. A nice board book, but not suitable for an older child."
1,very poor quality black and white images,"I don't understand why anyone would take as much time accumulating the large QUANTITY of logos this book contains, and then produce a book with such poor QUALITY images. I'd advise anyone to try to view the book before buying - I know if I had I would not have spent the money.Sounds like a couple of the 'reviews' here are not by purchasers such as myself, but are actually pitches from someone trying to increase sales volume."
2,lots of logos but poor quality,try to preview the book before purchasing it. granted there was a lot of time involved in accumulating the logo pics but the quality of printing suffered. the author should use another printer for his next edition.
2,"This book has quantity , but very low quality.","As a designer, I was appreciative of the large quantity of logos compiled in this book, but was quite frustrated with the very low quality of the printing and of the layout, making it very difficult to accurately see the designs. Not only are the logos often bitmapped-looking and out of focus, but some have actually been squeezed horizontally or vertically to fit them into a uniform space, demonstrating a lack of understanding and integrity. This book would be more useful to the collector who wants a quick reference, and is less useful to anyone concerned with viewing the logo designs."
5,Just what the doctor ordered,"The old one was corroded and would no longer hold water, so it had to be replaced. This drain plug was a perfect fit, and was a cinch to replace using the Superior Tools 6020 Tub Drain Wrench.Superior Tools 6020 Tub Drain Wrench, Fits 1/2-Inch and 3/8-Inch Ratchet"
1,Dull Dull Dull Dull Dull Dull Dull,"The plot sure has plenty of possibilities. To bad the the writting is so bad that none of them are realized. Certainly not worth the time or money. To bad you can't rate a book as NO stars as that is what this one is worth. No time, no stars, no excitement."
5,Got to love it,Bulgari scents are the best. I recommended it to my husband.It attracts and that is a good thing. Very upscale layers of scent.
1,"Arrived damaged, company refused to help - Amazon did!","Well the item arrived broken, but I did not see any evidene of damage to the shipping container itself. I contacted the company and they were far less than helpful. Essentially they told me they do not cover shipping damage and tough beans. So I contacted amazon and their A to Z guarantee did exactly what thet say it will do for you. Amazon was great - I can't say the same for Zoo Med. I would think twice before getting anything from these folks."
4,Easily searchable,Good succint articles and easy to search index make the book useful. Specific recommendations for remedies make shopping for product easier - if only the essential oils were more readily available! Well written without heavy philosophical statements.
3,Sloppy,"Good basic information, but there is little to no detail given on how to make the cakes look neat and professional. A few basic tips could have made this much more helpful. If you replicate these instructions you will end up with a cute but certainly not professional looking cake."
2,Not what I expected from a professional baker:,"I got this DVD from the library hoping to learn something new but was very disappointed in the content. Very basic material and the end cakes looked very amateurish. The back cover describes the cakes as ""stunning fondant cakes"" but it lacks the stunning part.If you are a novice and are just starting, this will be a good DVD to learn very basic techniques. But for the price, if you already have some knowledge in fondant, stick with another DVD tutorial."
1,"Don't waste your $! Overprice information,nothing special!",I was hoping for more information in the subject. Was very retard. This is the worst tape ever about this subject.
5,Ambient music for art therapists - at risk teenagers,"I have several favorites that I play while doing Art Therapy with adolescents in recovery. Pink Floyd's The Wall, Brian Eno's, Music for Airports and Huun Huur-tu, Where Young Grass Grows, continue to offer a perfect background for their art. I am replacing Where Young Grass grows because one of the young people wanted it."
2,Cheap knives,"I agree that this is probably a good set for college students sharing an apartment. Light-duty, dishwasher-safe. For someone who does a lot of cooking the low-end Farberware is basically junk, cheaply made stamped knives. For affordable good stamped knives, the Farberware Professional series is a better buy."
5,My name is Kazan! I'm Not a Little Boy.,"Don't call Kazan a little boy, he hates that and he is tougher than aney boy his age you know. His adventures are action packed with strange creatures, a good story line and a little magic."
5,Surprisingly Comfortable,"I wanted to replace a pair of Rocket Dog engineer boots that had finally succumbed after many years of supergluing the sole back together. I ordered these a 1/2 size larger then my usual boot size since they didn't have them in my exact size. They seem to run pretty true to size but I plan on wearing these with thicker socks to keep my toes from sliding around a bit. They are very well constructed and the leather is thick and rather stiff so it will take a little while to break these in, but they are surprisingly comfortable to wear. I like that they were made to last and I have gotten lots of compliments on them. I wear them with skinny jeans and leggings."
2,Ineffective,"I bought volume 1 & 2 together. Here's my review of volume 1 which also applies to volume 2:I bought this product with hopes of a more enjoyable way to expand my vocabulary. I tried to like this product (especially since it's a good chunk of money) and I gave it a fair amount of my time. In the end, I found it to be ineffective for these reasons:- The script is boring. It tries to be witty, but really comes of as cheesy/corny- I found myself constantly rewinding. The material just doesn't sink in. The stories and dialogue aren't memorable. Perhaps this is so because of the pace. I'd rather have fewer words and actually learn those words, than sweep through many words and have to backtrack. I'd say on average the amount of time spent listening to the material was TRIPLED because of rewinding.- The voices are a bit stuffy and robotic to meIn the end I stopped listening to Word Smart. It was just too laborious."
2,Light entertainment only,I bought this CD thinking that it would be a productive way to spend my commutes in the morning. It was however only mildly more productive than listening to idiot DJs on the radio. I think that I knew 80% of the words by 15 years of age. The only benefit gained was hearing them pronouced but being British I had grave suspicions concerning the US pronounciations! The two presenters are funny and quite listenable. I would recommend these CDs to high school students who do not read books but still hope to master thre English language well enough to pass exams.
3,Capitol K - Sounds Of The Empire,"Clattering, chaotic music from Capitol K on his album SOUNDS OF THE EMPIRE. From the dense and winding ""Song for Banana"" to the weird folk-jazz of ""Janome Home"" or ""Lagoon,"" there's no lack of ideas here. ""Doe (My Pooter Sings)"" takes a more melodic tack, and ""People,"" with its background of church bells, gives way to a symphony of feedback and percussion. And given the twinkling prettiness of ""Song for Belgium,"" one can only assume that the Belgians treated them well. The title track takes a sample of a Chinese melody and pours on the distortion and drums before going didgeridoo on it. The final track, ""Cosmonaut,"" seems to embody the schizophrenia inherent to the album: a guitar riff backed by beats, then devolving into squeals of noise. Though you have to love Capitol K's kitchen sink approach, it still remains an uneven way of doing things."
5,Wonderful case,"Perfect size for my 31x zoom professional camera, it keeps it safe, plus there's still room for all of its accessories in the pockets!"
4,Good for DSLR cameras,"I've had 3 cameras carried in this bag. Nikon D40, Nikon D80, and Nikon D90 all with a 18-200mm lens. Will not fit if the lens had even one filter on it tho. The side pockets can hold all the accessories i need - battery charger, power cord, usb cable and lens cleaner. Good build quality, recommended."
4,DCB-56 SLR Camera Holster (BLACK),"nice camera bag...esp for the price. the 2 things that made me give this a 4 instead of a 5:1. i wish the bag was just a tad bigger so that i can carry an extra lens (eg. my 50mm portrait lens...not one of those honking zoom lenses). i think they could have achieved this by making the side pockets expand more.2. i wish the side pockets had double zippers so that if i put something in there that's a little too big, i can still close most of the pocket up. eg. my mini tripod."
5,Snazzy camera bag,"The Case Logic Camera Holster is large for the Fujifilm camera I bought. For now I added a plastic air-filled pillow to cushion the camera but am sure the bag will fill up with accessories. Outer bags are great for mini-USB to USB cable, and extra batteries."
3,Good,"ES UN EXCELENTE PRODUCTO C O N CALIDAD GARANTIZADA LO RECOMIENDO CON LOS OJOS CERRADOS 100 % DESDE VALENCIA, VENEZUELA"
3,"Great bag, but dont drop it","its a great bag, but the way the chains and clip work its prone to opening if its dropped and the clip is not secured properly. otherwise its a great bag, has good padding, side compartments are perfect for extra battery and charger."
2,Smaller Than It Looks,"When I received the holster bag, I was surprised at how much smaller it is than it looks online. It does not fit my Canon 50D very well with the lens attached to it. I had to struggle to zip the bag up. Don't forget that the straps need to go in the bag also. I also realized that I do not have room to put in my carry on flash in the holster. I have returned this item and plan to buy a bigger holster bag. This may be OK for smaller DSLR cameras thoughs."
4,Wait for brochure that may come with the camera you ordered?,"Perhaps wait for brochure that may come with the camera you ordered, listing good accessories? What happened to me: some people bought this when buying a Lumix DMC-FZ28 camera, so it was listed that way when I ordered a Lumix. I ordered it, bit ot's way too large for my camera."
3,camera bag,"I would really like to agree with the previous points I had read. The bag is a little snug for an SLR camera with a fairly regular size lens. Also the carrying strap is a little flimsy. But in spite of these 2 points its a workable bag. And I love the color, its a nice break from all the black camera bags."
3,"Hmmmmmm, not bad I suppose.......","Well that was disapointing! From the blurb and front cover I expected a great story about Mal fighting all odds and outwitting her sexist English teacher, but instead she hardly did ANYTHING! Plus Mallory acted in this gross girlie way all through the book! I am SO glad she leaves the BSC soon after. Pity Dawn couldn't return and take her place! Take my advice, DON'T buy it unless you are a hardened Mallory fan. Best buy a different Mallory book instead!"
5,Michele CSX 33 DiamondWatch,"Beautiful watch. Authentic and priced below msrp. Although I ordered the CSX Petite and received the CSX 33, I am still very pleased. When I brought this to the attention of the seller, they insisted I ordered the CSX 33, which was incorrect, but I am happy nonetheless."
5,Power-packed little book,Bought this book for an online book study by the Community of Solitude. An excellent resource for discussing the Psalms.
3,Written to convince Laity of the appropriatness of praying the Psalms (the Daily Office),"This book seems more of an argument that laity can and should engage in praying The Daily Office (or Litany of the Hours) as part of their spiritual quest. It is written in a time of renewed monastic interest in which spirituality seemed limited to the professional religious. Overall, certainly not one of Merton's pivotal works nor one of his best."
4,An excellent look at the USAF Weapons School,Warfighters takes the reader into the USAF Weapons School to learn how the air force teaches its pilots to be at the top of thier profession. The book contains beautiful color photographs of the most high-tech military aircraft in action. The book gives a comprehensive history of the fighter and bomber aircraft of the the USAF. The Red Flag school is shown in good detail as are the adversary aircraft flown against students to teach them how to fight the latest soviet made fighters.
2,Save your money,"This product is nothing but a block of wood, a t-bolt and a leveler along with screws that are too short. Save your money and go to the hardware store and buy a t-bolt and leveler, drill a hole and install.I bought this product and wound up tossing the wood and screws and using the t-bold and leveler only. I would have saved time and money if I had done the above."
2,Had high hopes but...,it had great potential but in the end it was just disappointing. Too bad could have been a good thriller but it just didn't come together.
3,decent thriller,"Orlando Bloom in a movie where he isn't a pirate or an elf, holy cow. Good enough thriller, and the wife likes thrillers:)"
3,to slow,the movie itself was really slow and it dragged. I usually love Orlando bloom but his one was not one of his best films
2,Disjointed,"With an incognito Orland Bloom, this medical drama lacks energy, the Bloom character is wishy washy - at least in the 10 minutes we were able to watch it."
3,It's just okay... The story line...,"The story line could've been great,but it just drags on to the point where the first half is predictable.It gets a little better towards the end, but by that time you are already bored with the movie."
4,great movie,"I really liked this move, it was a great thriller. It is shocking to know a doctor could actually do all he did."
3,Where's the ending?,It seems certain characters weren't as developed as they could have been. This could have been a much richer story while remaining somewhat austere but it seems to have missed the mark - my review is as incomplete as the movie considering that the ending scene was cut short...presumably by Amazon. I doubt any director would end a movie that abruptly mid-sentence. Perhaps if you buy a copy instead of instant video. It was worth a one-time watch as the concept was interesting.
2,the good doctor,"this movie is burring, it's just keep dragging on and you'll think maybe it'll get better soon. Hell no, the end makes no sense. Total waist of time and money."
3,A Sunday afternoon impulse,Disappointing movie. Very unbelievable and marginal acting. Only mildly entertaining . . . My husband fell asleep during the movie.
3,weird but only interested because...,I checked it out because Riley Keough is the grandaughter of Elvis Presley..i do believe she is the first born of Lisa Marie..it was a kinda bad but Riley is still kind of unknown..this is obviously something she did to get some experience in acting
3,The Good Doctor,"Bloom does a fair job playing the main character. The plot is failry simple the acting is middle of the road. Personally, I got a little bored with this movie. What amazes me about the movie is how the supporting cast seem to feel he is innocent of any crimes. It so obvious their is something wrong about him."
2,Amazon Prime Froze,"I honestly can't rate this movie for its worth because we could not watch it. A few minutes into the movie, the screen froze. We could not even get back to the main menu. After about 7 minutes, it started again, only to freeze again within a few minutes. After the third ""freeze"", I told my husband to get out of Amazon and back to Netflix where in the past several years, I have had few problems like this. I am a recent customer for Amazon Prime, and so far, not a happy one. So, Good Doctor, accept my apologies for associating you with the lousy service rendering our viewing of you impossible."
4,Good Enjoyable Reading,"i enjoyed this one..it had a good storyline,great personable characters and kept me wanting to read it..."
2,"Good plot, but could do without the political diatribe.","After reading this novel I could not escape the feeling that this was several hours I would never get back. The writing was hokey and formulaic. The plot had potential, but with all of the political prosthelitizing garbage that was thrown in, the total effect was ruined. I suppose this would appeal to the average Texan, as this baloney usually does, but to someone with a little bit of intellectual curiosity, it just seems like so much unnecessary crap. To be fair though, I did read this immediately after finishing The Davinci Code, which is somewhat akin to listening to Roseanne Barr's rendition of the Star Spangled Banner immediately after hearing it performed by the New York Philharmonic."
2,ok,"(just a short review) The book itself is decent and has its merits, but IT WILL NOT TEACH YOU TO IMPROVISE JAZZ on the piano. It has some useful exercises, but the reader should have some music knowledge prior to reading the book and should not expect too much from it. I would recommend it to anyone who wishes to further their improv efficiency with practical exercises."
3,"Good Technically, tough to put into practice","I bought this book 4 years ago, trying to get into piano jazz. I do a lot of improvisation on keyboards. Somehow, I am having trouble with this book, nothing is happening! Maybe another book would help?"
5,Fun with Fungus!,"I keep telling people that aspergillus fumigatus, sporotrichosis, cryptococcosis neoformans were fun things- and Arthur Dorros and David Catrow have made it come to life. The illustrations are goey and as dimorphic as their real life branching hyphal counterparts! What fun for children to learn a bit about the ubiquitous world of mycology-- and end up in the Museum of Fungus and Industry to boot. As the administrator of a university-based of the Mycology Study ""Unit"" there are aspects to the ""discovery"" and ""experiment"" process that are truer than life, especially some of the zany characters and ultimate culminating dog and pony show! Thank you! Thank you! I can finally explain to my kids what I do every day! Fungus Fighters Unite! And what ever you do.....don't inhale!"
1,Not Impressed,"I've purchased dozens of travel guides for many different cities/countries over the years and this is the worst one I've ever seen. I bought it based on the reviews, but am very disappointed. I'm going to ditch it and try a more familiar publisher."
1,Don't waste your money,"The SAS Learner edition is virtually useless for most purposes. There doesn't appear to be a way to code it directly (you have to use the ""Enterprise Guide""), the output is not in the same format as the regular version, it's very picky about printers (the graphs won't print on my printer and will not ""print to file"" to be printed from there either), and it does NOT come with a useful manual even though the product description implies that it does. And worst of all, it does not help you to learn how to really use SAS software. This is a total waste of money!"
2,Fundamentally flawed,"This piece of software will prove useful to those looking to get a basic understanding of how the SAS system works. However, whilst the limit of 1000 records is perfectly acceptable for a learning tool, the ability to view your data tables has been REMOVED, therefore whilst you can the results of an analysis, you cannot see any of the data in your tables!! As a teacher, i cannot reccomend this software to my students."
4,Good for experimenting with SAS 8.x programs,"When prompted to let SAS manage *.log and *.sc2 files, I had to decline or installation would hang. For other problems, consult their official website....The book and its on-line version that come with the software illustrate how to use the GUI-- but NOTHING MORE. The Help topics miss a lot of commands. And for those that are covered, examples are often not included. To really get started, you need help from other sources, such as SAS On-line Documentation. However, this product's price is still reasonable given the richness of its functionalities."
2,The best of the History Channel is still pretty bad,"This documentary has all the bad qualities of a typical History Channel production -- the same reenactment clips over and over, skipping interesting points, glib overview. Get the PBS version instead.Empires - Islam: Empire of Faith"
1,Politically Correct Garbage...,"I was struck by how one-sided this oooh-sooo politically correct program was. It focuses almost exclusivly on the positive aspects of Islam without confronting the equally real--and very negative--side of this religion. There are two sides to Islam, just as their are two sides to most everything. However this video claims to ""take you inside Islam"". This implies OBJECTIVITY. Meaning a balancing of the negatives against the positives. I want my money back."
3,ALLAH PR,"After September 11, it's hard to reconcile the fear, hate and anti-Muslim bigotry with the seemingly beautiful religion of Mohammed as presented in INSIDE ISLAM.Jews, Christian and Moslems -- the so called ""People of the Book"" -- share a common ancestry with Abraham (about 2500 BC). Not only that, but Jesus, Mary and even the angel Gabriel are prominently featured in the Quran.In the Bible, God makes a promise of to Abraham's seed -- that both Isaac and Ishmael would become a great nation. They did, but a blood feud became religious and now, they still hate each other all under God's name.Two thousand plus years after Abraham, Jesus said, ""Love your enemies. Do good to those who hate you."" Maybe that's the only solution to a world engulfed in this very real spiritual war -- a blood-soaked jihad. An information war, if you will, that's increasingly over who God is and who's God rules -- the oil."
5,Extremely Good,Leon MacCawley plays beautifully expressively on this well recorded disc. This is Schumann as it shouold be played.
4,"Dry but informative, visuals worth the price of admission","""The Atlas of Medieval Man"" consists of text and a large number of photos, maps, and other visuals. While the text is well-rounded, covering each major area of civilization rather than just Europe, as is common, it is rather dryly written. Information is plentiful, but one can get bogged down; that's where the visuals come in. This book has a stunning array of artifact photos, architecture photos, manuscript reproductions, maps, etc. which outclass any other volume under $50. From the 11th century Hindu temple carvings to the stained glass of 14th century Europe, to the Aztec crystal skull of the 15th century, this book is a feast for the eyes as well as mind."
5,"Entertaining, Wonderful Illustrations","This book is a treasure for the child who likes monsters! The poems are funny and give a good spin to being a monster and the illustrations are not overly ghoulish, though probably thought provoking in some instances. I do think though that age 4 is a little to young for this book - it really should be for a child who can distinguish real from fantasy as it introduces topics that might be scary to the child who still thinks monsters COULD be real. It was too much for my 5 year old nephew, the eight year old loved it."
5,Kids love to hear these poems!,These poems are clever and fun to hear. The illustrations bring the words to life. My kids ask me to read these over and over again. (Fun for parents too.)
3,A Thrill Ride,"This thriller by Ed Gorman begins with a courtroom scene in which an accused man, Roy Gerard, is being tried for the murder of his parents. Assistant District Attorney, Jessica Dennis, is questioning a witness when gunmen, including Gerard's brother, David, enter the courtroom, open fire, and escape via helicopter with Gerard in tow. Jessica is wounded, and a reporter, Michael Shaw, comes to her aid. All of this action takes place in the first seven pages of the book.Flash forward five years, and the story continues with Roy Gerard scheduled to be put to death and now District Attorney Jessica Dennis preparing to debate the issue of the death penalty on national television. Brother David, having kept a low profile abroad, is back and determined to exact revenge on all people responsible for Roy's incarceration. He also has an elaborate plan to rescue his brother before the execution can take place.This book is action-packed and fast-moving. The suspense continues to the last page."
4,Sometimes older is better...,Charlie is pretty traditional blues but they write some great music and I think any blues fan would love this CD. I compare him with William Clarke which is a compliment to Charlie. Keep it up Charlie...sometimes older is better!
3,okay,Great egg pan they don't stick with very little oil however they stain even after extensive srubbing and they don't have rubber handles so they get hot quickly
1,Huge waste of money,"The Carol Burnett videos are vastly overpriced, especially compared to what you can buy for other shows. Huge disappointment!"
5,Great Pro Audio Card,"Low latency, decent software patching capabilities, quiet and reliable. This is a simple and trouble-free solution - that's why it's still available. Echo Mia Midi is great and affordable."
5,Outstanding & succinct presentation on essence of tantricism,"Although the book is brief, it seems to contain all the salient points of what tantricism is really all about. It reads like a blend of story, fable, and philosophy while presenting some intriguing tidbits for practical application. Definitely a book that can be read over and over to gain further insight. I was surprised that the author wrote the book that was the basis for the movie 'Diva'. I loved the movie when I saw it years ago, now I have to see it again."
5,Beautiful and engaging!,What a story! This story follows a pattern repeated many times in myth and legend and in historical times. It is a true hero's journey and hold lesson after lesson for the rest of us. Devi provides a great example of individual sovereignty. A must-have addition to any tantrika's library.
4,It's more than adequate,"Did we read the same book. I learned how to tail people, work undercover and pick a lock. How-to's are laid out in chapters. It was well worth what it costs."
5,bullmoose1,"these two are part of the heart and sole of bluegrass, and the best duo ever, Now if there is ever any doubt, listen to their ""when I stop dreaming"" It almost sounds like one voice. And ""nine pound hammer"" ain't bad either."
5,Serving something different,Loved the book. The dishes look great and easy to do. I wanted to give an Italian friend a taste of home and they were transported back to Rome in an instant. Really good adition to any cooks bookshelf.
5,loving you tamia,This song is absolutely gorgeous! Her vocals are amazing and can reduce you to tears. I cried the first time i heard it.
5,A Truly Gifted Artist,"Tamia is truly gifted artist. Her voice is incredible, and unlike any other. Unfortunately, she's not as appreciated or recognized for her talent, due to, I think, bad marketing and lack of airplay. ""Loving You Still"" is one of my favorite songs off of her debut, and the debut is in my car right now in fact! I can't stop listening to it. I beg of anyone who reads this: if you listen to the sound samples and agree with me about the incredible sound of Tamia's undeniable talent, buy the DEBUT album first! I think it's better than the sophomore album, "" A Nu Day."""
1,I have heard better songs by Tamia,"This is NOT one of the best songs on the album, but it was decently done"
4,Great little MP3 Player,"I started walking about 6months ago and needed an MP3 player. I got this one and it has not let me down yet. It is powered by 2 AA batteries which seem to last forever. The quality of the the sound is amazing too. I did have to buy another memory card so I could get more songs. For the money and the size of this little device, I would highly recommend it!!"
1,Not the right book after all,"Whilst looking for a cupcake book to add to my collection, I was initially attracted to the pictures and layout of this book. Instructions seemed clear and simple, and there were so many ideas to making different cupcakes from 2 basic batters.But when I did try making the basic chocolate cupcake... the results were disasterous. They collapsed immediately after baking and the cakes were wet and sticky.Since then, I couldn't bring myself to try yet another recipe in this book. Or perhaps, I may use the ideas but toss the recipes away. How can this book be recommended/good when one of its basic batters do not work?"
2,"good ideas, but beware","This book has great ideas for cupcake flavors and frosting/fillings, but the cakes themselves are lackluster. In 3 attempts, I have yet to make anything better from scratch than I could make with a betty crocker mix. Which is a lot of work for semi-satisfying results."
1,Not worth the money!,"While this is a beautiful book, the recipes themselves leave much to be desired! I am yet another who's chocolate sour cream cupcakes fell flat. I am planning on throwing this book away!"
1,Most Recipies didnt work!!,"I loved the book when I saw all the fun recipies, I was astonished by the beautiful photos . But once I tried the recepies they were a dissapointment, the chocoate cupcake recepie as other mentioned doesn{t work at all. And im acctually a very good cook with lots of experience, so all I can say is i wouldnt recomend it."
3,Nothing To Ride Home About,"I saw this book advertised in a catalogue and since I love to bake, was looking forward to trying out different cupcake recipes. The so-called Easy Yellow Cupcakes turned out to be a disaster. I even tried the recipe again to see if I messed up and it was still a flavorless/dry mess. The recipes for the frosting are good but I think I will stick with my own cake recipes."
1,Amateur,I purchased 3 different cupcake books and this one was the absolute worst. The other 2 had such amazing ideas and this book wasn't worth the price I paid. Would not recommend.
2,Good book for ideas - Bad recipes!,"I got this book after seeing the flavor ideas which were very inspired. However, I tried the first recipe (simple yellow cake) and the cupcakes were flat and chewy and didnt taste very good. They weren't awful but they sure weren't great either. That turned me off on the rest of the book since that recipe is in a lot of the other recipes. I didnt want to waste my time. I gave it 2 stars because of the inspiration behind it - otherwise it would have been a 1."
5,Pretty!,The pictures inside are so pretty of all the cupcakes. It came with great speed and is a wonderful buy!!
3,Left wondering?,"Like others here, I was disappointed that there are not more pictures in this book. And some of the pictures look delicious but do not tell you what recipe they are. However, over all, the book is presented beautifully.I'm not sure I want to try the chocolate sour cream cake after all the failures people have mentioned here. Unfortunately my 'easy' yellow cake recipe (followed absolutely to the step) were crispy on the outside, and too dough-ish in the inside. I know I can't pin this on the recipe - so then, tell me, recipe book - what has caused this!?The cakes that are shown do look delicious and I won't give up yet - but so far I'm not that satisfied. And I was so excited to get started too.: ("
2,Could have been great.,"Someone (author? editor? photographer? all three?) isn't clear on the concept that this is a COOKBOOK. Granted, due to budgetary restraints, some cookbooks can't photograph every recipe. Problem is, that this one could have. We have full-page artistic illustrations of mixing bowls, piping tubes, beaters, 2 pages of empty cupcake pans, and 3 full pages showing paper cupcake liners. We have one page showing three (unidentified) cupcakes with two of them out of focus. If all those full pages that were dedicated to artistic fulfillment and depth of field exercises, had instead each shown 2 or 3 cupcakes each, every recipe in the book could have been presented. Captioning would have been nice, too. One cannot assume that everyone knows what a ""vanilla cheesecake crunch top cupcake"" looks like, but I think that it should be safe to assume that everybody knows what a paper cupcake liner looks like!"
3,Pictures pictures - we want the pictures!,"So many cookbooks are photo-oriented, only to make the book better looking. You see props and garnishes that are never mentioned or described, leaving you to wonder ""if that flower is a sugar-coated pansy or porcelain"" or ""Was that cake stand vintage?""... that sort of thing. Well, this book is textually detailed down to the last dot so the lack of a photo for each recipe is a sad omission. You will want to make the cupcakes, sure, but only the ones with pictures because you have no clue how the other ones should look. If one is going to describe how to roll gumdrops out and curl them into tiny flowers, show a picture please. What's there looks gorgeous in this book but what is missing is missing in the biggest way."
2,use different recipes!!!,"I bake all the time, and have even taken a couple of courses; but the recipes in this book are all flawed! None of the cupcakes baked accordingly, so use this book as an inspiration and not a cookbook. FYI: Martha Stewart Baking Handbook and The Joy of Baking have great yellow and chocolate cake recipes that work all the time."
2,Nice pictures shame about basic recipe,"I actually like the pictures in this book and find it a nice book to read but I have found, as other people have, that the basic cupcake recipe for Chocolate Sour Cream Cupcakes does NOT work. I have tried it three times and (once totally ignoring the book method and using a method from another tried and tested book) found that each time the cupcakes sink and form huge craters that leave the cakes unedible. I am an avid cookbook collector and cook and have never found this problem before. Such a shame as the book looks so nice."
2,They Dont Rise!,"I have made the basic chocolate recipe twice, and both times they have failed to create that lovely round cupcake top...they come out flat at best, but more often than not they are concave. Very strange, and it can't be due to high altitude because I live on the second floor in New York City! They do taste pretty good and are very moist, but not very visually appealing."
2,Pictures?,"I ordered this book online, and just received it. A quick scan through and my first impression was...pictures? Where are they? It's a cookbook about cupcakes. I'm probably going to decide which ones I want to make based on how good they look. That may sound simplistic, but when's the last time a recipe grabbed you without a picture to go from? Especially when you *paid* for the book.I already had ""Hey There, Cupcake! 35 Yummy Fun Cupcake Recipes for All Occasions"" but there was no recipe in there to make the kind of frosting that piles up sky-high, which is why I bought this book (I have recently developed a love for cupcakes). I don't see any kind of frosting recipe like that in here. Literally, I don't *see* a recipe for that frosting. I doubt I'll use this book at all."
2,Disappointed,"I followed the recipe to the t, and yet my chocolate sour cream cupcake fell flat. I was making them for the son's 4th birthday. Luckily I know enough about baking to know to add more flour. My second batch came out perfectly. I returned the book ASAP. I was looking for ""new"" recipes, but decided to just do my own thing."
3,page numbers,"Although this is a comprehensive enough book on cupcakes, it's not the first one & I'd try another. I am so totally frustrated by the faint pink & tiny page numbers (on the mid-right of ea. page), that I'm donating this book to the Salvation Army. Even with my reading glasses I can barely read it, so imagine trying to quickly find a recipe?"
5,An ultra-chilled collection from Water Music,"""Sub Zero"" contains two CDs of some of the best in ambient/chill-out/electronica. These tracks, many un-released and hard-to-find, come from an amazing array of internationl artists including Goldfrapp, Gotan Project, Trnce Vision Steppers and Amadeus Tapioka.The first CD is titled ""Fahrenheit"" and contains more upbeat tunes, such as ""Utopia"" by Goldfrapp, ""Glide"" by Afterlife, ""Last Tango in Paris"" by Gotan Project and ""Foto Viva"" by Mo' Horizons. CD two is titled ""Centigrade"" and contains the more mellow, chill out grooves. Some of the best on this CD are ""Opium"" by Moodswings, ""Carpe Noctem"" by Pulsar Bleu, and ""Heaven"" by Electric Skychruch.This is a great collection for anyone who's already into ambient/chill out music or for those wanting to get a taste of it."
5,"Thank you, thank you, thank you!","Thank you other reviewers...I purchased this based upon your comments and I am very grateful. This is a superb chill collection. I had purchased some other Water Music CDs in the past...but different genre. It's nice to see a Label that actually cares about what they put out, and does it with INTEGRITY. It should be about the music...not just making money. Thank you, Water Music."
2,Well-researched but as dry as dust,"This book succeeds where few others have: it somehow makes the time of the English Civil War, Charles II and Marlborough seem as dull as ditchwater. What I find doubly disturbing is that this book, the worst-written of all the Pelican History of England series, is the only one currently in print.What were they thinking????"
5,Essential,"If you don't have this CD already and you're a harp player, you need to get it right now. This CD is not only well mastered, mixed, and with great fidelity, but has some absolutely fantastic playing by four harp legends all on one CD. Unlike most CD's featuring soloists, the backup band on this CD is not horribly boring (see Riding With The King), in fact, it's actually very good and listening to this CD is just great fun from start to finish. Buy a copy, stick it in your car, and crank it!"
4,Great Harmonica Blues,"I bought this CD because of the great song ""My Eyes Keep Me In Trouble"".The rest of the songs is pretty good too. If you like the blues, you can check this CD out. If you like the harmonica, this album, like Charlie Musselwhite's album Delta Harware, is a must-have."
3,Sloppy Harp,"It must've looked great on paper. This Grammy-award-winning album has an unbeatable roster, but somehow the elements don't gel. I think it's just too sloppy a mix - the originals of these songs have much more to offer. Still, you gotta love Cotton's 8-minute tortured version of ""Black Night"" (which, for my money, tops Charles Brown's) or the four of them rapping about big-legged women on ""My Eyes Keep Me In Trouble."" I grew less fond of this album with time, but it's still good for a little smile."
3,Good for students,"I stl have a percussion plus in my basement. Definitely as Cheap Learner's tool. It's worth sitting in a musty basement. I would proably buy something new, or assemble soemthing newer eventually."
4,Great!!,Great shipping! Haven't had a chance to use it yet now that I'm pregnant :) thank you for getting it to me anyways!
3,Good for novice readers,When I sent away for this book I expected it to be more detailed and have a wider variety of topics. It does a good job of giving you the basics of the topics it has without a lot of technical jargon. So if you are just starting to learn or read about abnormal psychological behaviors this is the perfect book for you. It also gives good references to other books for more detailed research on each of the conditions discussed in the book.
4,Potpurri of phobias and case studies,"If psychology interests you, this is a good read. I found it compelling and interesting because the authors give a brief summary and case study and cover a lot of different phobias and conditions that are very interesting."
5,Read it aloud to children,"My friend was making a mock lesson plan for her education class and we took turns reading the chapters to each other one afternoon. Intermediate readers would enjoy doing this with an adult-- most of the language isn't difficult, and the story moves at a good clip. I'm not a big fan of adventure or animal stories, but this one had me all choked up. Great fun."
2,Call of the Wild,"I was required to read this book for school. I'm in 8th grade and to me it was the boringst thing on the face of this planet. It didn't make a bit of sense to me and the descriptions were anything but interesting. Jack London described so much it got to the point where I couldn't remember what he was describing! Buck (the dog) went through many different owners and went to so many different places, that you couldnt' keep it straight! Don't think that I am just some rude kid who had no appreciation for books, I love to read, but this wasn't something I enjoyed! Other Author's and Books I've Read (that I actually liked): Maud Hart Lovelace, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Beverly Cleary, Edward Eager, and Lucy Maud Montgomery"
3,So far my least favorite Agatha Christie,"The premise was interesting with the ad in the paper, but I quickly felt none of the characters were well developed and so didn't feel connected to any of them, and the plot was just too ludicrous."
1,not historically correct: do not buy this book!,"Charles Reasoner is a good example of an ignorant American that knows little or nothing about Korea. His book, ""The Magic Amber"" is a legend alright, a legend in his own mind. The book is not only historically IN-correct, the illustrations contained are of Chinese with Japanese Kimonos. Come on Charles, you could have asked at least one Korean before going through the trouble of publishing a book that has nothing to do with Koreans."
5,They cast a spell on me..,"This film has an ensmble cast to end all ensemble casts.. what more could you ask for.. Jack nicholson as the devil.. Cher, Susan Sarandon, and (the impeccable) Michelle Pfiefer as three sultry sexy witches.. Darrel Van Horn comes to the town of Eastwick when he is summoned by three witches who have been scorned or hurt by the men they loved.. Cher Plays Alex, whose husband died and left her to raise a daughter by herself.. Michelle plays Suki, a newspaper journalist whose husband abandoned her because she got preganant all the time.. and Susan plays Jane, the divorced elemntary school music teacher.. Van Horn moves into each of their lives his own way and shows them the potential they always felt was there.. once the girls realize what is really going on, they exact their revenge.. A great, fun and Witty movie.. a must see.."
4,25 Word Or Less Review,"Great fun. Luscious ladies join Jack Nicholson at his best. Wonderfully black, vicious, and sexy for a star packed Hollywood production."
1,No Sound,"No Sound, no sound, no sound, no sound, nothing, zero,nada, thought had lost my hearing , what ? Hu ?"
4,Best Line -'I've got nothing against a good F%@#k!',One the best comedies ever made. Excellently played by all and nicely written. If you don't find this funny then there may be something wrong with you!
5,Great Movie!!!,First saw it in a tent in Kuwait during desert storm. Who else but Jack Nicholson to play Satan.
5,Who else but Jack...,"could play the devil and make it seem so real--and funny? When trio of New England singles summon the Devil by accident, they've got to somehow get him back. Meanwhile the Horned One is having a great time. The novel was great and if possible, the movie was even funnier."
3,It IS anamorphic,"Contrary to the other review on this site, Witches of Eastwick (a movie I really love) IS in anamorphic widescreen. It's presented in it's original aspect ratio as well. What it isn't, however, is remastered. It sorely needs a full remastering of picture and sound."
4,A Good Group of Stars,"As with most screenplays adapted from books, I thought the book version better. However, watching all the actors do their thing so well was very entertaining and I recommend this film to all who may be interested."
1,Keepcase?,Really like the movie but did not receive the advertised 'Keepcase'. Just the regular type dvd case. Disappointed. So don't be fooled by the description. Not what it says.
3,Great cast but weak plot!,"I watched this movie because with a cast like that this movie was bound to be good,but i was disappointed.It was a little entertaining(only because of Jack Nicholson)But as the movie progressed it got very weak!I am not going to watch this movie again unless paid or forced!"
4,"Like ""Click"" for girls!","This is an entertaining movie, unless you know several girls who are under the impression you are Satan, then you might want to not let them see it. They'll probably see it anyway. Girls are resourceful like that. If they do, do your best not to act like Satan and you should be ok."
3,Mistaken,"When I read the title, I thought the movie would be about witches... Well, there isn't the slightest bit of witchcraft in the whole movie! Appart from the misleading title, Cher doesn't do a great job acting, luckily Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer are great actors. I found the movie funny but the ending is weird! If you don't have anything else to watch, go for it but if you're looking for a witchcraft movie go for ""The Craft""."
2,If it wasn't for Jack...,"This movie is @ss. Jack is always fun to watch. He has the look and countenance of the devil, and is the only thing that keeps this movie from being totally unwatchable."
3,Ok up to a certian parts of this movie,This is a ok movie. I have to admiit that I have seen much better whitch movies then this one. MIchelle Phipher was grate in this movie but I have seen her act better then she did in this movie. Cher was also good in this movie she really did her carictor well. Susan Surranden has also been in much better movies but I have to say that she also dose a grate job of partraying her carictore. This is not the type of movie that I would say run out and bye but this is a ok movie for the reall which fanatics.
1,Very Dark and Weird,"I am very disappointed with this DVD. Of course, I am now comparing it with the TV remake called, 'Eastwick', previously on Wednesday nights. Jack Nicholson always makes a show dark and weird, and this is no exception. The guy playing his role in the TV remake is lighter, more likeable, and much better looking. I wish I had never purchased this DVD and did not even care to finish it. I only got half way through. Also, very dated. The girls were bimbos."
4,Let's hear it for the devil,"Jack nicholson does a near perfect job as the Devil. His wit, eyebrows and demonic laugher are perfect for the part. In the beginning of this movie there are some refreshingly different views of the devil, but in the middle and latter stages the old fundalmentalist views begin a gradual take over (hence only a 4 star rating). The ladies of the film all turn in fine performances and this is perhaps one of Cher's best jobs. The end of the flick gives hope for a happy future. Too bad they never made a follow-up film. If you like symbolism and absurdity, along with Nicholson's unique presence I highly recommend you give it view."
2,"Okay story, must read to finish the Wolf Arc","Read this book to find out how the Wolf plot ends. Alex Cross does a lot of globe trotting in this novel. It is okay, but the reason that I finished this book was to find out how the Wolf ends. It is not a very satisifying, nor conclusive, result."
2,A mediocre book made awful by sound effects.,"The Time Warner unabridged version I listened to sounds abridged. It's a mishmash poorly edited story that lacks cohesiveness. It was only 5 cassettes and they had to stretch it out to make that. Every chapter - some can't be more than a page - is unpleasantly announced with creepy fanfare in the background. ""Chapter 22,"" Read ""Chapter 22...""Some characters are introduced twice as though they hadn't appeared earlier. It jumps in fits and starts as though a variety of previously conceived places and situations were thrown together at random. Sometimes it moves at a thoughtful pace and then it rushes through events - or maybe the ""dramatic"" music blasts you and just makes it seem that way."
3,Where is the Crazy Wolf? Alex Cross Tries to Capture Him,"This book was okay. Not the very best of Patterson that I have read, but I stuck it out to see what happened. I thought the ending was kind of vague.The WOLF is destroying everything he can from London, Paris, to New York. He blows up buildings and murders people in cold blood without a thought. And he wants Alex Cross dead of course.Throughout the entire book, Alex is chasing the Wolf, trying to find out what his next dangerous move is going to be. But the Wolf makes it nearly impossible, and if Alex isn't careful, his own life and those of his family may be in the worst danger yet."
5,To those who panned this book; let me refer you to the,"dictionary where you can look up the words mystery, suspense and intrigue.Then re-read this book with that new knowledge and realize that a book that is striving to fulfill the readers' thirst for these three things; will not give you all the answers or telegraph the next happening.I do agree that Patterson's last few were less than bestsellers; but with LONDON BRIDGES he is back to his story-telling best.I truly enjoyed Alexs' duel with the Wolf and Weasel and thought the last few chapters were surprising and exceptional.And I will gladly accept Patterson's semi-great novels along with his many 'really great' ones...like LONDON BRIDGES!"
2,Alex Cross novels are wonderful....this one fell short of the mark,"I listened to the unabridged audiocassette version of the book. The story was ok, certainly not one of James Patterson's best. The marching sound between chapters was distracting and annoying. When the reader spoke the chapter numbers he apparently used a devise to altered his voice (grim-reaper?)which made the numbers barely understandable.I love Alex Cross and the Women's Mystery Club. As always, I look forward to the next."
2,Below par from his previous Alex Cross books.......,"I listened to this book on tape. The plot was so unbelievable, that it took me a while to finish the book. You did not find out why the wolf blowed up the bridges. A lot of unanswered questions? Patterson's previous Cross books were so good I couldn't stop listening to them. I think he wanted to hurry up and finish this one.All Cross was doing was getting on a plane and not staying long at each location, going to London, other places were the Wolf was to blow up bridges, seeing his son, Jamella and coming home. The story should have been developed more were Alex wasn't jumped around so much. The story sould have gone more in depth.I will still read Patterson's books but this one was not up to his standard of writing. Skip this one."
2,Huge Alex Cross Fan is Disappointed,"I love James Patterson's Alex Cross and couldn't wait for London Bridges to come out since finishing all the others in the Alex Cross series. I usually read an Alex Cross in a couple of days, this one took me a couple of weeks. I hope the next one is better!"
2,Not as good as his others in this series,"I thought this book was boring. Patterson usually has a balance of Alex Cross's personal life with his work life, but it seemed like he droned on and on about the new case. It was a bit dry. The ending also seemed strange and sudden, and it left me wondering what just happened. The identity of the Wolf is dissapointing and unimportant. I would not recommend buying this book, but you might want to borrow it from the library just to keep up with the series."
2,"Better than Big Bad Wolf, but that's not saying much.-","********Warning, some mild spoilers********It's absolutely amazing that Patterson wrote off the entirety of Big Bad Wolf in one sentence. And the fact that the plot of this ""sequel"" is so completely unrelated to the previous book that it's laughable. He even pulled in elements from even EARLIER books almost like he couldn't find a way (or was too lazy) to tie up the loose ends in another book. He seems to be on cruise control and not taking much time to write these.The pacing of this book is at a fever pitch......that is until the last 80 pages or so. Once Alex comes back from Paris, it seems almost laid back, and everything is dropped in Alex's lap once again.Since there are no loose ends, this IS my final Patterson book."
2,Dr. Cross looses the way,"This book was a real dissapointment. It seemed like Dr. Cross forgot or did not use any of the skills he has been known for.He drifts along like a leaf caught in the wind with little or no direction. The other characters also lack any interest. The plot is weak and you are left to wonder how chance is the only way the ""bad guys"" get caught. I would skip this one. I think Dr Cross would also.Tony MartinoRiver Pines California"
1,Not one of Pattersons' best!,"I never read a review for this and now I wish I had. Without a doubt the worst James Patterson book I've read and I've have really enjoyed all his previous books. This one, however, seemed to be written in a hurry. All Alex Cross did was jet from one city to another. The entire premise was bizarre and the outcome of events was, well, boring. Without giving anything away to those who have not read this, there are a couple of events at the very end that were so badly glossed over that you wondered if Mr. Patterson was trying to get to a dinner party and had to finish in a hurry. Nope, not a good read at all. I'm hoping his next book will be a huge improvement!"
1,A waste of time,"I have read several other in the Alex Cross series. This bookwas disappointing. The dumest part was the where the ""wolf""warns of a terrotist attack on New York. Later he has his henchmen attach plastic elplosives to an unguarded bridge. Itwas hard to believe. The rest of the story was difficult to follow and I found myself speed reading just to finsih it. I cannot understand how this was a bestseller its so bad."
1,I Want the 2 Hours I Spent Reading This Dreck Back....,"I have never been so mad in my life after reading a book. This is truly an insulting waste of the paper it was printed on.I do not believe that James Patterson even wrote this; if he did, he has suffered major brain trauma. The plotting, tone, characterization, dialogue, etc. are juvenile and vapid. Chapters average 2 pages in length. You should not expect any complex sentences or thoughts as the writing is geared to a sixth-grade mentality.This is not the Alex Cross you have known and loved in the early novels. He is quite the dunce in this, incapable of speaking complete thoughts or thinking coherently.I guess Alex Cross novels 'jumped the shark"" with ""Roses Are Red"" and 'Violets Are Blue"".Please, protect yourself. Save your time and money and avoid this mediocrity. Go buy and read a good Alex Delaware or Easy Rawling novel instead. You will thank me for my advice."
1,Gratuitous Violence,Much too much gratuitous violence particularly in the later pages. It serves no purpose. It doesn't aid the plot or establish the character of the Wolf or Alex Cross. That is already done. Can we have intelligence rather than violence? I don't want to see the movie and I doubt it would get two thumbs up.
2,Getting worse each time...,"The Alex Cross series seems to be getting worse with each release. Yet another title where I finished it and said ""that really was not that good"""
1,The worst book I have read,"I cannot believe I see London Bridges all over bookstore stands. This book is the most ridiculous piece of crap I've ever read. The writing is terrible, the story completely ridicuolous. His writing is appealing to a crowd of old retired magnum P.I's. Don't read this book unless you have an unbelievable amount of free time and someone paid you to."
1,Do not waste your money,"Long flight ahead? Then this is not the book for you. Staring at the back of the seat in front will provide more gripping entertainment. This is the worst written book I have read in decades. Am I allowed to give zero stars? In a narrative full of supposedly critical deadlines his 'hero' is inexplicably AWOL from the action for huge chunks of time. He peppers the book with tidbits to imply that someone did some research, but you learn nothing that an hour on Google would not have provided. This is my first, but for sure my last purchase of a Patterson novel. Next time I will grab a Clancy or a Le Carre from my bookshelf to reread."
2,too gruesome,"I find it very difficult to continue with this book. I am listening to the audio and it is too gruesome. I have read/listened to many of Patterson's books, but this one really leaves me cold."
1,Very Thin,I was very disappointed in James Patterson on this occasion. I have read many of his books and by-in-large have enjoyed most of them. There was very little real intrigue here and the plot was very thin. The dialogue was boring.
1,Worst James Patterson Book yet,"More and more half pages to make the book appear to me larger. This book has more new and insignificant characters introduced with lots of character discriptions to use as fill for this very shallow plot. After reading this book, I felt ripped off by the author, I have been an avid reader of James Patterson, but his last few books, I felt were mostly fill to get them out to the public. no quality, only for monetary gain.I believe Mr Patterson must do a lot better than this poor showing for me to buy anymore of his books.A very disappointed reader"
2,Time to Step Aside Mr. Patterson,I have been reading each Alex Cross book in order. Each one has been harder and harder to get through. The ONLY reason I gave this one even 2 stars is because I am hoping the GOOD writing we have come to expect from Patterson will return soon.This book had so many turns and twists it was like being on the Tilt-A-Wirl and not in a good way.Then after growing to hate and fear the Wolf the character is ended like that??!!! Give me a break. I am a 30 something accountant and I could have come up with a more shocking ending.The Ole Mr. Patterson of past - PLEASE COME BACK !
2,Not Realistic,"I have read many of Patterson's books, including his last work 'The Big Bad Wolf', and enjoyed most of his works. However, maybe its my sense of paying attention to the fact that thriller writers or wannabe thriller writers have so much realistic material to draw from these days that I am simply not willing to accept the fantasim of thriller writing any longer. In 'London Bridges' I enjoyed the opening of the story; however, I felt as if I was on a downhill ski slope, and I was speeding thereafterUnfortunatley, 'London Bridges' is predictable and leaves to many loose ends to clean up, which Patterson does not. Current suspense/thriller fiction, I dispear, seems to be less insightful, and so, less meaningful. Patterson could and should have done much better."
1,We Need a Do Over,"I've read all James Patterson's novels, so LONDON BRIDGES was a real letdown. It read more like a news account, rather than a novel, and I found myself skimming the pages as I would a newspaper article. Character development was zip, zero, zilch.I have a suggestion for the next Alex Cross novel. Alex could awaken from a bad dream, the details of which are already fading, except that it involved both the Weasel and the Wolf and unbelievable worldwide chaos and terror. Then Alex could go downstairs to have breakfast with Nana Mama and the kids, and the REAL tenth Alex Cross novel could begin.Please Mr. Patterson?"
3,Not Patterson's Best.,"I was disappointed by this book, as a new comer to the series, I have seen the best of Patterson (Along Came A Spider, Kiss the Girls.) This definately does not compare to his earlier novels. The plot in this book is weak, and fails to hold the attention of the reader. Patterson is trying to hard, and the result is a book that flops about halfway through. If looking for a good thriller, read Thomas Harris if you haven't yet. I just hope that Patterson's future books are as good as his first few."
2,Predictable and tired.,This is paint by numbers writing. It sort of reminds me of the 10th season of a TV show. Tired. Cliche characters. Not good at all.
3,Unfulfilling,"I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book...and once I had it, it stayed on my night table for over three weeks. Needless to say, the book did not fulfill what Big Bad Wolf had left us tasting... I found this book to be extremely twisted, and not in the good way, Alex is in Seattle with his son for one page and next thing you know he is somewhere else trying to catch the Wolf.I thought the Wolf would live up to his reputation in London Bridges, but both he and the Weasel fall short to the characters we'd come to appreciate in their first books. Here the Weasel is barely mentioned and you just can't catch glimpses of his old self.The Wolf is just a manipulating greedy criminal whom you can never tell if you're reading about him or not.I admit I have been dissapointed, but I will not stop reading James Patterson novels, because I keep hoping to read another novel as exciting as Kiss the Girls."
2,Sadly not worth the wait,"I read Big Bad Wolf in a marathon session and couldn't wait for the sequel. Unfortunately, London Bridges didn't live up to my expectations. I expected that the story would be equally riveting and instead found a convoluted mess of characters that had nothing to do with one another at the core. The story line was disjointed and full of truly ridiculous plot twists that ultimately had little or no bearing on the outcome. Perhaps I missed the point? I don't know - I'm a big Patterson fan but found London Bridges to be lacking the mystery and intrigue I've grown so fond of. By the end, I really didn't care who was the Wolf. Not up to the usual Patterson quality."
3,London Bridges - worth a quick read,"With London Bridges, Patterson picks up where he left off with Big Bad Wolf. Not surprisingly, the Wolf has returned as the nemesis of Alex Cross. In a bit of a twist, however, Patterson brings back The Weasel, Cross' nemesis several books back, to team up with the Wolf in a murderous, high-stakes extortion and terrorism plot. The storyline itself is not bad at all, starting strong and keeping pace throughout. My only complaint is that the dialog is choppy and the story seems a bit jumpy, in part because Cross is bouncing around the world in an attempt to track the Wolf and bring him to justice. All-in-all, this work is clearly not spectacular. It is, however, worth a quick read."
1,Insults Your Intelligence,I have not read the other reviews but to me this book insults my intelligence. Other than making money the only reason to write this book was to terminate a couple of bad guys from previous books in the Alex Cross series. I have enjoyed this author's previous Alex Cross novels as well as his lady murder club series but this book is truly bad. The story is preposturous and no one can possibly believe it could happen. It is a very fast read with large print and two or three page chapters. Don't waste your money on this one.
2,"Sorry James, but this one really stunk...","I've been a big fan of James Patterson, and his novels, following them avidly. But recently, the Alex Cross novels have began to take a downward slide. I keep reading, in hope that perhaps the next will be better than the previous one read, but so far, I've been let down. London Bridges was terrible, and made no sense at all. It appeared to be slapped together without any thought at all. I'm confused... I thought the Women's Murder Club novels were superb, so what's happening to Alex Cross?"
4,Loved the book,"After reading it, I was so taken that I have decided to read the whole Alex Cross series in order"
3,Typical Patterson,"With the exception of the needless sex scenes, Patterson weaves a good yarn with one fatal flaw...the ending. It's as if he simply puts all his efforts in the lead up then just gives up and ends it with a couple of sentences rather than giving a complete back story on the bad guy. Too many of the books end this way and it yesterday's news"
2,worst yet,"This has to be the worst yet of the Alex Cross series I have read so far. WAY TOO MUCH unnecessary detail and what a way to drag out a plot. This book took me 3 weeks to read, which is triple what it usually takes me."
4,More rhymes,Patterson still hits it out of the park with another interesting plot twist. Don't forget to read them in order.
2,Unfascinating,I love James Patterson but I have to say this book is a weak book. Characters seem to pop out from nowhere to give information and useless pieces at that. Even catching the Wolf at the end was such a letdown after using two books to tell the story. Reading this book didn't do it for me at all or maybe it's cos there's now a huge difference between reading his books when I was 17 and in high school and now when I'm 20 and in college.
2,Plenty of action...with little cohesiveness,"The Wolf...and the Weasel...are back. And, of course, their sadistic methods of murder, zamochit, and sexual deviancy are on full display from almost page one. The plot, however, is full of more holes than a sinking ship. Although I read this book in a few days(it is no doubt a page-turner), it wasn't nearly as suspenseful or enjoyable as The Big Bad Wolf.Not helping matters, the dreadfully abrupt ending proves painfully anticlimactic and rings hollow. This is nothing short of formula-driven and was without a doubt written under the pressure of a submission deadline undoubtedly pushed by JP's publisher. It shows."
2,Very Disappointed,"I have always enjoyed Patterson's novels, particularly the Alex Cross books. London Bridges however was very disappointing. There is too much left unexplained with a lot of incomprehensible plot twists, don't get me wrong I love twist and turns, but in this book Patterson seems to be making it up as he goes along. The ending doesn't leave you wanting more as much as it leaves you going ""huh?"". Patterson has written some incredible stories but it is beginning to look as if he now just wants to crank them out to pay the bills."
3,London Bridge Fell Down,"This book seemed a formulaic labor that Patterson had to get through and be done with. Once he got to the point where Cross was going to capture the criminals he wanted to get, the rest seemed matter of fact. Cross chased these two guys through two previous novels, and this book - where he finally got them - seemed, to me, anti-climactic."
2,Fast Food Fare,"I won't waste a lot of your time. Suffice to say that James Patterson is best read on a plane or a beach. His stories are to contrived and the dialogue is pitiful at best. Try reading some of the dialogue he writes outloud as a test. Do people actually speak this way to each other???? Finally his books tend to run close to 400 pages but only because the chapters are so small, the words are spaced out, and finally there are less lines per page then your average book. You really are only getting about 250 or so pages from what I can see. Probably a good thing as his tales can be laborious. I have read three of his books and this is the last one I will read. Sorry I spent the money."
2,A THIN STORY - NOT THE AUTHOR'S BEST BY FAR,"I had to agree with ""Book Worm's"" review on this one. This is a rather empty shell of a book and certainly not the author's best work. The story line could have been rather good, but there was just too much ""filler"" stuck in between the meat of the story. I almost have to lay blame for this on the publisher. They should have known better. If you read this one, I certainly would recommend you check it out from the library or borrow it rather than plunk your hard earned money down for it. I have enjoyed this author's work before and do hope for better from him in the future"
3,"typical patterson, fast moving, lots of chapters","less suspense then previous novels, great audio CD with music....Alex Cross has become a hero, but less so in this novel....."
4,The Wolf,"Of course, I am an Alex Cross fan. Unfortunately. I did not start this series from the beginning so I am playing catch up. London Bridge did not disappoint. Now some of the later and earlier references make sense. Great read and plenty of action to keep you interested."
1,I thought the problem was me,"I finished the book and couldn't understand how the pieces fit together. So I re-read the book carefully to attempt to make some sense out of it. Guess what. The pieces don't add up. This is especially disappointing since the book is a page turner. The problem only comes when you've turned the last page and realize that you've been ""had."""
1,Save your time and money -- don't buy this book!,"I used to be an avid James Patterson fan, but his last few Alex Cross books have gotten more and more preposterous. This one was the frosting on the cake. The chapters were one and two pages, the print is too big and suddenly the book ends. We hear that Alex's family was kidnapped and then nothing more except that they were returned five days later. What happened? We're introduced to several new characters without a second mention of them again. We find that Alex is flying all over the world chasing the Wolf and within a few pages, he's supposedly captured. Or is he? The detail that is stetched out so vividly in the beginning of the book is nowhere at the end. It seemed like Patterson lost interest in the story and wrapped it up in a few chapters without any consideration given to fleshing out the storyline. Shame on you, Mr. Patterson. We have learned to expect more from you than this book has given us!"
2,Michael Nails,"Again--James Patterson get up a good head of steam and fizziles in the end. Never really expaining things and leaving me empty again. It is a quick read, but Alex Cross is confussed with his life and not much of an investigator witht he FBI. Patterson should have stopped with ""Along Came a Spider."""
1,Don't waste your time!,"After reading The Lake House, I swore I wouldn't read another Patterson book except for his Alex Cross series, so I bought Big Bad Wolf. It was awful, but I figured I'd give him one more chance and bought this one. What a waste! This book has the short, choppy sentences and short chapters like Where the Wind Blows, The Lake House, and Big Bad Wolf, and he continues to use italics to show emotion, instead of WRITING emotion. I don't know what has happened to Patterson, but this is the last of his books I'll ever buy! Why waste my time on a second (or third) class writer? By the way, did you notice how similar the dust jackets for this one and Big Bad Wolf are? Not just the writing that is boring..."
3,"Exciting Plot Twists, Paper-Thin Characters","I have to say that I liked the short chapters, the fast pace, the easy-reading quality, and the excitement. However, the trade-off for this is thin characters and the addition of scenes that are supposed to build up emotional interest that are treated so briefly they just seem silly. For example, a one page dinner with an old friend, a page-and-a-half sexual encounter with an old flame. Giving these scenes the same treatment as bullet-blazing action makes them seem a bit ridiculous. All in all it was okay."
3,I love Alex Cross but...,"But I wish James Patterson would have him settle with one woman. I have fun with the villains and plot twists he comes up with. You DEFINITELY have to have read other Alex Cross novels to follow this one!! There should be a warning on the cover -- ""for Alex Cross fans only"". I found it a fun read but while dark, a little lighter in plot substance than some of his other Alex Cross books. I do believe Alex is getting to old to NOT settle down. I would really love to see him finalize things with ""Jam"". I think it would add a nice element to future stories. I am looking forward to improvements in the next installment."
1,What?,"It was number one. That's supposed to mean a good book, right?Wrong.The writing is bad. The dialogue--no one talks like that!The plot would have been good in someone else's tender arms. Patterson has written a novel worse than Carol Higgins Clark's POPPED.And I was expecting an explosive ending. It was more of a dud.One star is too good for this simple, unrealistic novel. Come on, Patterson, if you're a master, write a book that lives up to that name!!!"
2,The worst book of the Alex Cross series,"If you, like me, are caught up in the season and decide to invest your hard-earned money in this piece of pablum, then you should know that it would have been better to have made the 1% interest in your savings account. The book has over 120 chapters in under 400 pages. Say anything to you? Patterson phoned this one in. Captivating dialog like, ""Nice is nice."" (speaking of the city in Frace) Patterson has become a caricature of a novelist. The plot is simplistic, the verbage sophmoric, the ending like a bad TV mini-series. Save your time and save your money... otherwise I really liked it."
1,Is Patterson Really the Author?,"After reading the reviews, I am fully convinced that Patterson did not write his last 2 books. This is a talented author with a imagination and writing style that is unique. Why must these authors submit to the mass market just to publish. I felt the same way about Sidney Sheldon's new book. I guess I'll read London Bridges when I can buy it for less that $1.00"
1,I want my $20 back!,"The release of London Bridges was the equivalent of Hollywood releasing ""Police Academy 7"". I agree with the reviewer that pointed out it appeared as if Patterson was in a rush to make a deadline when he wrote this (perhaps the actual ""Wolf"" was holding a gun to his head making him write). In any case, I really enjoyed his previous Cross novels and Beach House-- but this book lacked any real depth, plot or character development. He jumps around and assumes the reader knows the multitude of characters he introduces. The chapters were over before they started and the weak storyline was tired and predictable. After reading the likes of Lehane, Crais and Connelly, it really made it stand out how boring Patterson can be and how bland his writing is. I'd start with his earlier Alex Cross novels and then stop after Kiss the Girls."
2,You've said it all,"And lets not forget Theo. Another loose end that pops up out of nowhere (actually Seattle) and withers on the vine. It appears most of these reviews have had more thought and planning put into them than the latest from Mr. Patterson. But, c'mon, what did you expect? 'It is what it is', as they say. If you are surprised or disappointed his stories are quickly and unbelievably tied up, written in an open-ended style that can spawn ten more 'follow ups', have big print and short chapters and now cost $27.99 hardback, then either you haven't read his other books or failed to scan the pages in the book store before buying. I agree though, it looks like he did finish the book quickly to have a beer with friends."
1,Dumbed down,"I've read previous Patterson/Alex Cross mysteries and enjoyed them, but this one was disappointing. It felt like most of the story was about the agony of waiting helplessly for a terrorist's deadline to arrive. Many situations arose in which Alex Cross could do nothing effective or interesting, and the thrill of the chase was absolutely not there. Not much sleuthin' goin' on! My advice would be to forget ""London Bridges"" and read (or re-read!) some earlier Patterson/Cross stories."
2,Definitely not his best ....,"I'm a big fan of Patterson's ""Alex Cross"" series, but this one was just not very good. It was very far-fetched and the ending was like hitting a brick wall. It was also tough to keep up with all the characters that were introduced. It's not the worst book I've read and it does keep you turning the pages ... just don't expect too much, and don't expect to have all your questions answered."
2,"Great, great, good, FLOP",I was SHOCKED by how a seemingly good book became an obvious disappointment SO QUICKLY. Patterson should have left out some non-essential juicy middle chapters to enable him space to give the story a proper ending.
3,Love James Patterson but disappointed by this novel...,"I usually LOVE James Patterson novels and can usually fly through the pages not wanting to put the book down until I've read the very last word. This novel was very disappointing. It was ""slow"" and not very interesting. It took me forever to read because I just wasn't ""into it"" like the other novels. This is the only book of his that I've been disappointed in."
1,READ B . LARSON review-PERFECT,Will not waste much on this book....it is an insult to fans and even the casual reader.....great series basically shot..utterly ridiculous plot....ughhh...forget it
2,London Bridge,"This London Bridge is not only falling down, it should have never been built (or written). There is still some of the old James Patterson magic, but this comes across as almost a parody of Patterson's work. Wolf and Weasel come across as more likevillains from a James Bond book. (unlimited money, unlimited manpower and unlimited bombs) The pace is fast and furious as with all Patterson books but that is where it ends."
2,Absolutely preposterous,"I've been reading the Alex Cross mysteries since the beginning. They started out strong but it seems that Patterson, in his attempt to up the ante with each subsequent release, has gone totally overboard with outlandish plot devices, ridiculous set-ups and character motivations that defy all logic and reality. I wouldn't be surprised if next time Cross finds himself battling shape-shifting aliens from the tenth dimension.Also, the quality of the writing has begun to slip. Nail-biting suspense has been replaced with shock-value reveals and bait & switch routines that can be predicted chapters in advance. By the time the final climax occured, I'd stopped caring. I'm just glad I pick these books up at the library. If I'd paid $25+ for this book I'd be mighty pissed."
3,Not as good as I had hoped,"I've read several Alex Cross novels and was rather anxious to dig into this newest installment. However I agree with most of the other reviews that this was not Patterson's best work.What drew me into the earlier books was the combination of psychologist and detective. This seemed to be missing from London Bridges. Instead Cross spends the majority of the book chasing the bad guy(s) globe trotting on an FBI jet not exaiming the criminal mind and coming up with profiles, etc... Also, it seems cheap to bring back not just one previous villian, but two.Despite the shortocmings, Patterson's skill as an author keep the pages turning quickly. If you're an Alex Cross fan this is still worth reading, but don't buy a copy (at least not a hard cover copy), get one from the library. Or I'll let you borrow mine.JK"
3,3 1/2 stars,"James Patterson doesn't like to waste words when he writes. The lack of depth is proof of that. And because of that this novel was quickly read and absorbed. An international thriller in which appears both the Weasel (whose quick demise also surprised me) and the Wolf.It was entertaining enough to read--my library copy--but, as most people, I was disappointed with the overall depth and quickness, as well as the ending."
3,London Bridges,"Not near as ""nail-biting"" as other Alex Cross books. It didn't seem that plot development was up to Patterson standards. Other Cross books much better."
2,Not one of his better ones,"Sorry to say that I find the Alex Cross Novels in the early days much better, a lot more intesting and better written. I have a feeling that he is getting into mass producing his novels like so many other big authors and the quality just isn't there anymore. :("
2,Dramatically Disappointing,"I picked up this book to introduce myself to a new mystery writer. I figured the 10th novel of a popular series would have to be passable. Boy was I wrong.This book is weak. It has the following:* Weak Characters (especially good guys)* Weak Plot (writer got bored towards end)* Weak Writing (phrases like ""fairly certain"")I'm not interested enough in Patterson to give him another try. On to Hillerman!"
1,AWFUL!!,"I never write reviews but I feel so strongly about how bad this book is that I had to write to warn people not to buy it!! It is the worst book I ever read - the ending is terrible, the plot never develops and I was actually mad that something like this was printed! Dont' buy it!!!"
1,I just don't get it,"I agree with most other reviewers this is not Patterson's best effort. The part that bothered me most is in Chapter 90 (paperback). Alex is out with his kids for the day and LONGS FOR THE NINETEENTH CENTURY. He even mentions plantations. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Alex Cross is Black, yes? Why in the world would a Black American man wish for, no long for, the nineteeth century? As Alex said ... a simpler time.Only a white man would have written such a chapter.Mr. Patterson, you can do better."
2,Disappointing,"If it wasn't for the fact that I listened to the audio book version during my daily commute to work, I probably would have abandoned this book halfway through.The end is confusing, and I'm left wanting more, not in a good way."
2,It helps to read in the right order!,"I made the mistake of reading 'London Bridges' without having read 'Big Bad Wolf' or 'Pop Goes the Weasel'.As a result, I felt like I'd stumbled into some surrealistic Cross novel, filled with cliched Tom Clancyish terrorist 'action', and bad guys with names ripped off from the 'Batman' TV series.Cross just doesn't work well as an FBI agent, particularly in this case. All the 'international intrigue' is lost in a jumbled mess of cliches. The saving grace here is the interaction between Alex and his family, always a welcome break in any Cross story, but here, the only thing that seems to 'belong', and remind the reader that this really IS an Alex Cross book!I'm encouraged after reading 'Mary, Mary', that Alex seems to be back in his element, and I hope Patterson is, too. He does good 'police suspense thrillers', but he should leave the terrorism drama to more qualified authors."
3,Fast and Easy,"I'm surprised at some of the low ratings reviewers have given this book. I really liked it, and even considered it one of the better in the Alex Cross series. That is, until the very end, which left me saying ""Huh""? It just sort of ended all at once in one paragraph, almost as an afterthought, which is the only reason I deducted stars.I still think the Wolf is one of Patterson's better creations, sort of the Voldemort of the thriller world. I didn't mind the constant, horrific murders, although they eventually took on a cartoon-like quality, and I avidly followed the storyline. This is my first time back in Alex Cross-land in a while, as I had to take a break from the earlier novels. But having read Big Bad Wolf and London Bridges back-to-back, I'm satisfied. I will never consider Patterson a Grade A writer, but so what? The books are fun, fast, and furious...perfect escapism."
2,Like an eagle,"This book or maybe this writer swoops like an eagle. JP wanted to do an excellent thriller mingling his two archenemies in one book. All he did was a waste of time, paper, ink and anything else you'd like. The story goes out of the main plot so many times, or rather I say it goes in the plot so little that you forget what are you reading.The Weasel:If you already read 'Pop Goes the Weasel' you'll know that the way Dr. Cross killed the Weasel is pathetic. Why? Because the Weasel is suppose to be ruthless and relentless and independent and very cunning. Everything that happens to him in this book made him conceit and reckless and meek and tame.The WolfI don't know why JP wrote so many pages with this character, at the end of the book, the way the FBI's director knew who he was was dimwit. He could do that kind of investigation in the first pages of the book and we could save some paper and time with that. The way Dr. Cross get him was hilarious."
1,Never even finished it,I got about 100 pages into this book and decided it was about as deep as something I could watch in an hours worth of drama tv. Definitely a disappointment. His earlier books were much better.
1,It is getting bad...,"I liked the earlier Cross novels for leisure reading when not in the mood for more serious fare, but these newer ones (especially this one) are getting ridiculous, make no sense, have stale dialogue, and have crossed the boundary from serious detective stories to comic-book idiocy. The two vampire books were bad, but this one is unbelievable. I can't believe Paterson wrote it. In fact, I don't think he did. It had to be a staff-member of other amateur. The people who rate this book highly must be company plants. Alex Cross fans are more than disappointed. The series is no longer worth following."
2,Ending leaves you flat,"I look forward to my ""junk food reading"" and sat down to read this one with excitement. It was a quick read, but the plot was boring and the ending unsatisfying. I hope the next Alex Cross story is a little more thrilling."
2,Very disappointed. . .,"James Patterson has been one of my favorite authors, and I can't wait to pick up his new books as they are available. I asked for this one for Christmas. Sadly, I was very disappointed. The writing is stilted and the plot questionable. I feel, as do some of the other reviewers, that this book was churned out to meet a deadline. The only reason I finished it was because my husband paid full price for it as soon as it came out. Next time, I'll wait for the paperback version, or better yet get it from the library so I don't feel so ripped off!"
1,Treating fans with contempt!,"I think this is the last Patterson novel I will read. Utter rubbish, badly written (in five minutes?), and just for the paycheque I'd say. The prose includes so many italicised sentences and words: does Patterson want to emphasise EVERYthing you READ, to MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND what he's TRYING TO SAY? Give me a break, I can read already!!!God, he's taken a huge fall here. Bad plotting, idiotic suppositions, poor flow, and - honestly! - a writing style you'd expect from a (just reasonable) writer as a first attempt at 16 or 17 years old. I'm no writer, but I know I could do better than this crap.I have no idea how much Patterson or his publishers paid for the editorial reviews included here at Amazon, but they should be ashamed of giving praise to such a contemptible treatment of a (formerly) entertaining writer's fans."
1,Worst Alex Cross novel ever,"I've read and enjoyed all of the Alex Cross novels but this one is flat out no good. If this had been the first one I read, I would never had read the others."
1,London Boring,"After reading BIG BAD WOLF I was hoping that Paterson would give up on writing the follow-up book. Along comes one of the worst books EVER written, published and sold in a bookstore, LONDON BRIDGES. Chapter after chapter of poor developed characters and unbelievable plot twists. Why Paterson why? I think we have seen the end of a great author and great character. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. Save your time and money."
3,Okay but Not the Best in Alex Cross series,"I have read all of the Alex Cross books and this is my least favorite. I love Alex's interaction with his family and friends and feel they were given but a passing nod in this book. Still, Patterson's books are good, fast-paced and entertaining. This is no exception. It is a bit disappointing compared to the others but still worth reading."
2,What a total disappointment,"Having been disappointed by several of the Pattersons with another authors name atttached, I thought wow he really wrote this one! But I was so disappointed the story was boring the writing way to spare. Even for a trash reader this was awful. I think soon we will find that Patterson is really dead, cause I doubt he wrote this one. His books used to be so rich and suspenseful now they are just boring. This will be my last Patterson, and if you read his kid's book you would join me in the feeling that he is just not writing anymore, he has people doing it for him. He is just a brand name and it has lost its luster."
1,Don't Waste Your Time Reading,By far this is the worst of the Alex Cross books! This book was obviously written very quickly with no attention to detail. The plot is ridiculous and the ending is very disappointing. Wait until the book is in paperwork if you have to buy it.
1,By far the worst Alex Cross novel yet...,"I am an avid reader and I was sucked in by Patterson's first two novels in the Alex Cross series (Along Came a Spider and Kiss the Girls). London Bridges is, by far, the worst Alex Cross novel so far. What I have come to love about the series is the in depth interaction between Alex and his family and Alex and John Sampson. This novel glosses over this dynamic leaving a great deal to be desired. I found myself skimming pages and just hoping I could make it to the end. I have just begun Mary, Mary and I hope it is the Alex Cross of old!"
3,Alex Cross is needed again. Fast pace story,"The WOLF and the WEASEL unite in this interesting story of LONDON BRIDGES.They work together, against Cross, and against the world. The governments of the United States, England, France, and Israel are put on notice: what happened in Sunrise Valley when it is desminated by a bomb will occur in their respective capitals, unless the Wolf is paid a king's ransom and several hundred ""political prisoners"" are released.The narrator Kerry Shale did an excellent job with all the voices.I found it fast pace and easy to follow. BUT my all time favourite of James Patterson is ALONG COMES A SPIDER"
2,unconvincing teamup,The center of London Bridges is the team up between two of Cross previous fors the Weasel and the Wolf but the teamup is poorly executed and unconvincing and as a result the novel falls flat Only Cat and Mouse is weaker among the Cross novels in my opinion
2,What is going on?,"I love James Patterson. I love the Alex Cross series. I am not sure what happened here. Usually, when I am reading I can't put it down, that was not the case with this book. I felt as if it were all over the place. There was too much going on and too much international travel. I wonder if Patterson read this before he published it."
2,How not to construct a plot or characters,"From Publishers Weekly""Any thriller writer, wannabe or actual, would do well to study Patterson's 10th Alex Cross novel.""My mistake was reading this comment from Publisher's weekly (it appeared on the back cover of the paperback edition) and thinking that it would be an example of how a book should be written. That sounded like a strong endorsement. Having purchased and read it, I realised they must have meant it as an example of how a book should NOT be written."
1,Don't waste your time.,"Disjointed, utterly predictable plot, and poor character development. Obviously, Patterson phoned this one in just for the bucks."
1,London Bridges,"I only gave 1 star, because that was the lowest available. I forced my way through this book, because I was incredulous that it was published. This is a prime example of an author, who takes a great character and destroys him. I loved the early Alex Cross books, but they have progressively deteriorated, culminating in the horrid London Bridges. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. There are many other good books out there."
1,What a disaster!,"I rushed to buy this Alex Cross novel, snatching it from beneath the unsuspecting nose of another fan! Die- hard Patterson fan? Yes indeed, devouring Pop the Weasel, for example, in the space of a single afternoons' sun worship! But this? I find it almost inconceivable that he could have produced such unadulterated nonsense, incoherant from beginning to end, pointless, ineffective, need I go on? Even my husband, to whom I introduced the pleasures of James Patterson, described it as complete rubbish! As a result of this, I have sought my literary pleasures elsewhere, barely casting a glance at 4th of July in the shops. Come on, James, you can and have done better than this rehash."
1,A Low Point for Patterson,"Up to now I've been a Patterson fan. Knowing that - my wife bought me ""London Bridges"" for my reading during our recent vacation.I'm a guy who finishes books - even when they become tedious. Part way through the book I was tempted to give up. Patterson kept throwing roadblock after roadblock in front of Alex Cross to the point of adnauseum. Endless variations of a theme as if there was a need to turn what was essentially a short story into a full length novel.But I persevered, regretfully. It was as if Patterson himself got exhausted from his endless variations to keep the chase going and determined to end the misery in a few pages. A very unsatisfactory and implausable ending.I'll definitely not buy (or borrow) another Patterson novel again w/o having seen a number of glowing reviews. ""London Bridges"" is one of the worst reading waste of times I can remember. And from an author I used to enjoy!"
3,London Bridge Falls Down....,"I read all Patterson's books. This latest one is a cut above the last few he has churned out. The first 3/4 of the book is a page turner! Then it falls down quickly. When he finally finds The Wolf it is right out of a B movie..laughable! His friend's wife ""says' she is The Wolf...then nothing. The Wolf ""dies"" two or three times in the book..in front of Alex's eyes each time. Do I see a sequal here?What happen to the four billion dollars...who took Nana and the kids and where did they go???Why was the Englishman a mole for The Wolf...he must have had a reason??? The bridges...??that is a stretch too far Mr. Patterson."
2,Definitely the worst Alex Cross novel so far...,I read all the novels in the publication order and thus I am very disappointed with this part. It simply did not deliver. One of the biggest annoyances for me was that a character that has been built up over many years is killed off in two sentences. Also some plot points could be written in much more detail as mentioned in many other reviews here. Not a very good novel. For me it is the worst I read from Patterson so far.
2,Worst ending EVER!!,I love this mans books but I was totally bummed with the almost predictable ending.
2,London boring bridge,"I do like James Paterson and the Alex Cross series. However this book left me flat. So many screwy plot lines, people dying and and falling off the story line without any explanation at all. It was way too much of a 'miracle happens here' and the story continues.I feel like I want my money back! HA HA"
1,"Phenomenal story, horrible kindle book",Fantastic sequal to the big bad wolf. But the publisher has disabeld the text-to-speech function on the Kindle.
3,"Not his best, but not his worst","I thought the sequel to the Wolf's story was a little boring for Patterson. Terrorism plots have been over-done by many authors. I was also confused as to why there was such a big drama over Geoffrey Schafer being one of the villains, and then when Alex Cross finally kills him, there is no other mention of him in the book, and that part of the storyline is dropped completely, with no tie-in to the rest of the story. We never found out why the Wolf chose Schafer. I did like the ending, however. As always, Cross gets his man."
2,A fourth quartile effort ....,"I know, I know, he's a high-volume, good writer. I've read all his books. Of his last five, four have been 2nd quartile. But this feels tired. Contrived premise. Still a reasonably OK read though, for airline trips.I rate 8 to10 books in this genre each month. I rate it based on a 0-5 point scale. This book rated Characters: 1.50. Realism: 2.00. Description: 3.00. Ah Ha: 2.00. The Read: 3.00. Overall, the book ranked 279 out of 362 books."
1,London Bridges - Washed away in floods :-(,"What was he thinking with the ending? I remember reading Along came a spider while on holiday in Portugal. My holiday coinicided with a massive heatwave.. Yet I had goosebumps while reading it.Having read London Bridges, I had neither goosebumps nor chills.. I did however have a slight baldspot on the back of my head, having scratched it so vigorously wondering why the last few chapters of this book went so seriously awry.Bafflingly bad ending.."
1,Huge Disappointment!!,"James Patterson is one of my favorite authors, so I was very excited when this book came out. But...I must say, this is his worst book ever. I started it maybe like a month ago, and it failed to grab my attention one bit. It took me forever to read because I just wasn't interested in what happens. I almost contemplated putting it away without finishing it. There was no real plot to speak of. Nothing is ever satisfactorily explained. Characters from previous novels are brought back for no logical reason. And while I used to like Patterson's style of writing very short chapters, it seemed almost juvenile in this book. Literally like something a high school student could have written. I sincerely hope his next effort is better than this, or I will not be a Patterson fan much longer."
1,Finished with Alex Cross Novels,"I am officially finished with Alex Cross novels. Patterson's early Cross novels (Spider, Girls, Jack & Jill) were great, but the books as of late have been getting progressively worse--and now London Bridges is the worst of all. The Wolf is an absurdly powerful enemy, and seems to have access to unlimited money, manpower, information, etc. Not only is the Wolf and the whole London Bridges storyline ridiculous, the multiple ""fake"" endings are even worse. Every time you think you know who the Wolf is, the rug gets pulled out from beneath your feet. Does Patterson even know who the Wolf is? Does he care? Does he think his multiple endings are good writing? It's a shame b/c Patterson has taken a great character and just ruined him with the crap he now sells masquarading as thriller novels."
3,Patterson Pattern Strikes Again,"Well, here is another story following the standard Patterson pattern. This story centered around two villains the Wolf and Weasel and a threat to destroy London, New York and Paris in a 4 day period. Alex Cross is sprung from his vacation when he gets the call to stop this before it's too late. Are the ""Wolf and the Weasel"" working together on this one? This book literally had me on the edge within the first few pages, and I read it while traveling from LA to New York. I couldn't put it down."
2,Extremely slow read.,"This addition to the Cross series was very disappointing to me. I typically enjoy James Patterson's books for the simple fact that if I want to spend a couple of days relaxing and doing nothing, I can fly through these books. This was not so with London Bridges. I am disappointed to say that it took me probably two months to make it through this book because it just did not hold my attention for more than a couple pages at a time. Eventually, I talked myself into reading the rest of it for the simple fact that I could move on to Mary, Mary."
1,Boring. Unbelievable. Waste of time.,"Sometimes you'll read a book and when it's over it's like you've lost a good friend. This is not one of those books. The only reason I finished it was because I was traveling and had no other books.It's just tedious. The super-hero is neither super no heroic. The evil mastermind is one dimensional. The ""climax"" is boring and predictable.Usually when I'm about four pages into a book like this, I stop reading. It's just dull and trite. I can't believe it was published."
1,"Horrible, The worse of the alex cross series.","I have been a James Patterson fan for ages but I have to say that this is with out a doubt his worse book by far. They take a great character like the Weasel and basically kill him off in order to make this lame villain called the wolf a major player. The writing has falling from what it used to be and the story is not well told. I forgave Patterson a little too much for his last few novels but no more. He better get his butt in gear because if his next book is as bad as this one, it will be the last book I buy by him."
1,to say this is poorly written would be a compliment,"How does this guy sell so many book?The writing is awful.Pedestrian and unoriginal.And the dialogue?Wooden. Patterson has no idea how people talk.Don't waste your time.Read other writers in the field who are much more talented.Like George Pelecanos,Laura Lippman,Dennis Lehane,Michael Connelly, Minetta Walters and Ian Rankin to name a few."
1,one hundred billion dollars,"It will be OK for kids, but everybody else would be offended by its idiocy."
4,Gut Wrenching,"Excellent, fast paced, and suspenseful. Alex Cross is my favorite James Patterson character. He was true to form in this novel. Great read! Very hard to put down. I recommend this book to true crime solving, murder mystery readers."
1,Audio Book Version flaw,While I have usually enjoyed the Alex Cross Series both in audio and print format I was unable to listen to this title in the audio format. For some reason I cannot fathom a decision was made to announce each chapter with extremely annoying sound effects. One wants the book to flow smoothly but this was a major distraction.
1,So bad that I can't believe James Patterson actually wrote it.,"Definitely not one of his best efforts. Every element of the story seems forced, nothing made sense in way the case was solved or the points that led up to the conclusion. It all materialized out of thin air in the last few chapters.Maybe it's time for Alex Cross to hang up the holster."
2,London Bridges has the Series Falling Down!!,"Ok, I am definately an Alex Cross fan and up until I read the Big Bad Wolf I've loved all the books. But what I can't figure out is what the heck is going on???? The last two books have been awful. The story about the ""Wolf"" was boring and just really not exciting at all!!! I was really disappointed on how London Bridges ended. The book had me wanting more, but as far as I know that story is over. My review for the book would be that I didn't like it, but had to muddle through it just to get to the next one. Hopefully it will bring us back to the James Patterson we all know and loved before the stories of ""the Wolf""."
1,What a disappointment!!,"Between the hokey sound effects, bad English accents and the gratutious opening chapter, this was a disaster. This was my first Alex Cross novel and I doubt if I will pursue any others."
3,"Eh, It's Okay","Ah, the era when Patterson wrote all of his own books. This book is *so* many steps above the dreck he publishes now, yet still not the greatest. I think my problem with lies in the complexity of the evil plot. I didn't really buy it in this context, perhaps because the book takes itself seriously. You could have this type of plot in an Ian Fleming or Clive Cussler novel, because it is delivered with a wink and a nod. Here, it's meant as a ""this could really happen"" scenario. There's just too many pieces and plots for everything to be controlled by one man (or woman). That being said, I was still entertained, and it was nice to visit with Alex Cross again. I may avoid most of Patterson's newer books, but I expect I won't be able to avoid finishing this series."
1,Lost Book London Bridges,"London Bridges was ordered, paid for, but never received. So I cannot review a book that I did not received"
1,WHAT'S THE RUMPUS?,"Stack yet another wannabe novel on that big pile with a swashbuckling terrorist wanting to blow up big cities. It's heartening to see others underwhelmed with this vapid 'thriller' because I quite frankly don't understand why Patterson bothered beyond the first three Alex Cross novels.His writing has only gotten more pedestrian, his plots more bromidic, fresh from the read-along-and-dont-ask-questions school of action writing. Quick 3-page chapters seem set up for pace but muddle the flow instead, there isn't a smidge of build-up.Twenty pages into this tripe I was all but ready to smack the addle-pat reviewers at Publishers Weekly who glowed with odes like ""Best of Patterson's work!"" Well, that it isn't.In mood for a well-oiled thriller? Try 'Paranoia' by Joseph Finder or almost anything by Lee Child."
2,Love it or hate it!,"Judging Patterson writing is a tricky business. He publishes three or four books a year, mostly written by somebody else. His style (or the style of the people that writes for him) is very simple, maybe seventh grade. Chapters are very short, and that can be annoying or make the story move really fast. One has come to expect countless twists and cliffhangers in the story, and again that can be exciting or exhausting.This book is no exception. The plots move at the speed of light, characterization is poor, we move from one murder to the next and when we are overloaded and we don't care anymore explanations and the real killer are revealed.This is a carbon copy of his other books. It is entertaining if you don't expect much. But read one and you have read them all."
1,oh please.,"If this screenplay thinly-disguised as an Alex Cross novel ever made it to film, audiences the world over will have to glue themselves to the seats of the cinemas to finish it, like they probably did for the banal, overly contrived prequel, `Along Came the Spider'. It is boring.The plot is shockingly old - evil terrorists, scary bomb threats in the world's major cities, torture and megadecibel explosions - you can almost hear the explosions in your head every few chapters - drowning out plot, characterization, whatnot.Twists and turns? One or two small ones to keep the audience on their toes, if not to justify this novel as a thriller in genre.Worst of all, James Patterson wastes Alex Cross, super cool Washington DC-based crime fighter and devoted family man on yet another watered-down plot."
3,Very dissapointing,"I picked up this book the first week it was out. I am 14 and love the series. For the the most part though this is really dissapointing. When I learned the Weasel was back I was really exited because I loved Pop Goes the Weasel. Any way Alex cross has gotten into another fix. Two villians, a family, a lover, and terrorist threats. Its not a serial killer or a mystery story, its terrorists. So the story was kind of different than a fan would be used to. Plus the ending was so fast and anti-climatic with a twist that runs right by you. But the worst thing about this book was ( spoiler warning) is that one of the two villians die in the middle of the story out of no where, another anti-climatic scene. As for the graphic violence and sexual elements there is hardly anything in it. Its not as bumpy as the other ones, but still very dissapointing."
2,An Action-Packed Disappointment,"Like most Patterson fans, I have read every single Alex Cross novel. With Patterson's London Bridges release, I can unequivocally say I am truly disappointed by the book's incontinuity and abruptness. It's almost as if Patterson takes on more than he can chew by taking his readers literally all over the globe in an incomprehensible terrorist plot. What's worse is Patterson's tendency to rush from one sequence to the next without any clear transition. Also--Patterson seems to rehash recurring character themes (Cross' conflict between family and work--yawn) without providing any indication of resolution. I found myself skimming over and over again to get to the ""bottom-line"" when one wasn't apparent. While this book is action-packed and reintroduces readers to old villains, I felt the material was rushed from start to finish. I certainly hope the follow up gives readers a chance to slow down and enjoy new plot lines."
2,Nice start but the ending was just BAD!,I have read all of the Alex Cross novels. Some are better then others. I read the Big Bad Wolf in a day and thought it was pretty good. I figured the author would not be able to have Cross dispatch the bad guy for a couple of books due to the mysery surrounding his identity. I started London Bridges looking forward to a good novel. At the start it was indeed a very good story. However the ending was perhaps one of the worst I have ever seen. I don't want to give anything away but it was like the author was bored and wanted to finish the novel quickly. So he cooked up the dumb solution to catching the Wolf. It ruined the whole book for me. Why must all of the authors novels be so damn short? Either leave a cliffhanger or just write a bigger book! The ending just made no sense.
1,Written by high school sophomores?,"I've enjoye;d a number of Cross's books, but can't help but wonder if he farmed this one out to a High School boys' creative writing class. In short, it was just plain silly. Not bad, not thoughtless, just plain silly. The formula used by which every hireling of the villain does his task and then is summarily shot, blown up, knifed appears to come from boys who do a lot of video gaming, pressing buttons, watching people die. Please, Mr. Patterson, take some time off, relax, recreate, refuel, don't write a word for a year or so, then come back and give us another good Alex Cross story."
1,Patterson's worst novel,"I've read, and enjoyed most everything Patterson has written, but this was terrible. My advice is to try something else instead. The characters are cardboard and the story is like a comic book."
1,Not Worth The Time,"This is, without a doubt, one of the worst examples of a novel I have ever encountered. While the book starts with an interesting story and lots of action, it devolves into literary trash about three quarters of the way through. The plot twists start to make no sense at all, seemingly pulled from a hat somewhere; the characters do things that make less sense than the 'new, improved' plot the reader was just introduced to half a paragraph before; a sex scene, which, honestly, does nothing to help the book and could (should?) have been omitted entirely, could have easily been written by a vocabulary deficient 14 year old boy. In all, this was the worst Patterson novel I've come across, ever. But it does illustrate where the true genius lies: with the screenwriters who turn his novels into movies."
2,Patterson Dud,"James Patterson fails his faithful readers with his latest Alex Cross novel. The story seemed contrived and unbelievable, almost like a report of activities. The dialog was trite and didn't draw you into the story. I kept wondering if Mr. Patterson actually wrote the book and I certainly feel cheated that I paid good money for a new book. Like Patricia Cornwell before him, I guess I'll no longer automaically buy his new books."
3,The wait was better than the book,"Having read all of the Alex Cross novels, I was excited to read London Bridges. When The Big Bad Wolf ended, I knew Mr. Patterson's next book had to pick up where this one ended. I immediately expected the next book to be his best one yet... it seemed that it had to be. For a year I waited for London Bridges and went out to buy it the first day it came out. Now after just finishing it, I truly have to say it wasn't his best. The ending was more like ""that's it??? After all that, this is how it ends?"" And I'm still not sure of the identity of the man Alex and Ned were chasing on the rooftop. Towards the end, I just got confused. However, I will say that I won't stop reading Mr. Patterson's books. He still remains one of my favorite authors. I'm waiting for his next women detectives novel to be published."
1,An awful book,"this is the worst Patterson book yet -- trite, thin, formulistic. He dwells on the same themes, goes over the wall on the plot and is totally unrealistic. not worth your time reading it."
1,Hope you love the Ted Turner logo!,"This one wins the ""worst presentation on DVD"" award. They've sandwiched the ""Ted Turner"" logo in-between the overture and the main title. You start the film, listen to the beautiful 5 minute overture, and are then assaulted by the Turner logo (at a higher volume) before the main titles start. I guess we're not supposed to forget that Turner had an integral part in the production of this classic film. What next? Stick to the laserdisc -- they didn't screw it up there."
5,"James Stewart, Henry Fonda, John Wayne, Gregory Peck, Richard Widmark, Lee J. Cobb, Karl Malden, George Peppard....","Epic western masterpiece spanning a good chunk of the 19th century, now in Smilebox which simulates the giant curvaceous Cinerama screen (can be viewed the plain old flat way too)....fantastic stuff here.... The blu-ray looks very very good with vague remnants of the Cinerama tri-screen dividing lines (kinda like now-you-see'em-now-you-don't) so prominent on the first dvd release....great story and scenery....nothing like it before or since....excellent...."
4,Best Movie on less than best disk,"This is the best historical-fiction movie about the U.S. that has ever been made. All I can say about this disk, however, is that it will send you searching for a Cinerama presentation (the way I saw it when it first came out). I only found one surviving Cinerama theatre showing this movie and, so far, not when I could go see it. Seeing it via this disk is a thousand times better than not seeing it all, however. This film is that great."
4,"Jimmy Stewart, Gregory Peck, lots-o-buffalo..great epic!","This flick has everybody. Jimmy Stewart, Gregory Peck, Walter Brennen, Debbie Reynolds, you name them, they are probably in this epic western. Lots of action but it does tend to drag in the middle. A must for every home collection."
2,"Needs a better format, anamorphic","I saw the film in LA, at the original Cinerama, in the originalshowing. This film is not going to be right until shown inHDTV (HD-DVD), but for Pete's sake, why letterbox ?What a trashy way to treat this classic. Stick a crowbar in yourwallet and spring for an anamorphic release. When the HD-DVD withproper restoration shows up, I'll buy a copy of that, not rent."
2,Poor Quality,"While this motion picture is clearly a classic epic, the quality of the DVD was horrible. There were two visible stripes on the left and right hand side of the picture frame in the wide screen mode."
5,Compre agora!,"Portuguese review:Para quem gosta de clássicos e ainda de westerns que fizeram história, este disco é imperdível por trs razes, no mínimo: a imagem está impecável, a verso em tela cinerama é super charmosa e tudo, inclusive os extras, está legendado em bom portugus brasileiro e de Portugal. É isso!"
1,"Terrible, terrible, terrible. Save your money!","I love westerns. I grew up in the 50's watching western serials, and seeing western movies. But even the great names of Hollywood (Fonda, Peck, Cobb et al)couldn't save this movie from itself.The brassy, overblown acting of Robert Preston grated on me. I expected him to leap any moment into a Music Man song. The plot was awful and dull.But worse than anything was the absolutely cheesiest screen appearance on DVD. It looked just like you are at a drive-in theater with three dirty movie screens pushed together with no attempt to hide the awful un-matched color and exposure on each one. What an insult and a rip off. Surely someone could have digitally enhanced this on."
2,"Historic film which, unfortunately, has not aged well","This film WAS the first dramatic film (or actually the second, since ""The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm"" was shot second but released first) to be shot and released in three-panel Cinerama. Keeping in mind the medium and the relative sizes of the people on-screen in the theaters, there are no closeups. The acting (from a wonderful cast) and writing is therefore broad and simplistic. On a whole, this is a film that technically and craft-wise just doesn't hold up very well today. And, who the hell put a full screen Turner logo in the middle of a letterboxed presentation anyway. Does Turner and MGM employ college interns for this work? Most unprofessional presentation."
1,This fine old film deserves better treatment (11/30/98),"It appears that the original wide screen version was divided into three sections with a separate camera filming each section. Apparently the film masters for each section have aged differently. The result is that you can see color balance differences in each section of the screen. For example, the left and right may look OK while the center appears faded. The 3 areas of the screen are quite distinct from each other (especially in bright outdoor scenes). For me, it was somewhat like viewing the movie through a kaleidoscope and I found it distracting."
1,Poor Edition,"This review is about the 2007 'John Wayne Collection' DVD edition of the film. New packaging, same sorry edition contained on other DVD (even Laserdisc) editions and further more the packaging claims ""Enhanced for widescreen TVs"" not true! The picture quality is terrible. Considering the DVD technology that exists today there is no reason the print couldn't have been cleaned up. Also, the two lines that appear in the middle of the screen (from being filmed in the Cinerama process) could have been eliminated. This is a great classic film that deserves a deluxe DVD edition. I expect more from WB with their long line of quality product not this horrible DVD transfer repackaged for an unsuspecting public! Avoid this until a better DVD edition comes along."
2,How The West Was Won,"Along with the failures in the picture quality, I am surprised no reviews mention the time length of only 155 minutes. The original was 162 mins. I suspect they shortened or completely left out the great soundtrack music in the Opening, Intermission, and closing orchestrations. Since I read the other reviews, I did not buy this version. Can someone help me as to where the missing minutes are?"
2,Years Later...,"I first saw this movie when I was a kid at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood and I loved it. Today, many years later, I don't love it anymore! On the positive side, some of the scenes and sets where excellent. The film was shot in Cinerama and it's hard to watch on television. I found the line breaks on either side of center very annoying. Overall the cast was a who's who in Hollywood but mostly these ordinarily great actors where cast in corny, unbelievable roles. My recommendation is to watch it on the Western Channel if you don't have anything better to do. Save your money and your movie library space."
5,western movie,"Still enjoy those grand scale western adventure movies. They just don't make-em like this anymore.Suggest buying this one, if you like westerns."
4,HTWWW - 3 Disc Special Edition,"I was fortunate enough to see this film (and The Wonderful World of the Brother's Grimm) in Cinerama during its original release and still remember being amazed at the technology and production values. Last night I watched the included documentary and was amazed at the quality of the sound during the playing of the HTWWW clips. Unfortunately, I don't think the Dolby 5.1 audio is a good when watching the actual movie. Visually the restoration is impressive, but I think the sound is just good. Nevertheless I am so glad to finally have this wonderful film in my collection."
4,HOW THE WEST WAS WON,"One of only two movies actually done in the original CINERAMA format. Disappointed it did not capture the Cinerama effects. Even on a front projection 120 inch it didn't look any different that today's widescreen movies.btw, the other original CINERAMA movie [Wonderful World Of The Brothers Grimn] DOES project the effects - at least on VHS.google Cinerama for the facts."
4,"Excellently restored, but..","The restorers have done a superb job of turning this movie into a home cinema experience but the nature of the beast that is Cinerama isn't easy to tame. This comes as a 2 Blu-ray set with one done (very) widescreen and the other done in the odd smilebox format. Neither is perfect nor could they be but it's certainly a grand experience either way.It's not my favourite film but the reason for buying was the grandeur of it, some miscolouring still appears from time to time where the film stocks were joined but it doesn't hurt the overall feel of it.It's understandable after seeing this as well as home video allows why only two Cinerama films were made, for all its grandeur it doesn't present any better than the extra wide but normal films that followed, with the distorted fish-eye like view sometimes detracting.However it does present as a very collectible film and the quality is quite superb overall."
4,Almost as good as it gets,"If you can't see HOW THE WEST WAS WON in full three-screen Cinerama, this is just about the next best thing. I only regret that this package doesn't include the ""Smilebox"" version that simulates the curved Cinerama screen (you'll have to get the Blu-ray for that). But otherwise, this package is well worth having for its gorgeous image and full-range audio, its informative five-handed commentary, the excellent CINERAMA ADVENTURE documentary about the Cinerama process itself, and the nifty hard-copy extras: miniature facsimiles of the souvenir program, press book, lobby cards and on-set photos. After all the wretched video transfers of this classic western, we finally have one that does it as much justice as home video can."
4,Time piece,"This was an enduring adventure that over the years it covers brings the veiwer an up close and personal experience of that period, I loved the acting and cinema-scape. Of couse being up graded to Blu-ray brings added sound quality and some what better image, the HD quality will never be what recently filmed movies produce. All the same I'm glad to of made the purchase."
1,Great movie - bad DVD,"This classic is a must-see for anyone who likes westerns. I've seen it twice in a theater. I bought the DVD and what a disappointment! The bad transfer made viewing unbearable, impossible. I cannot tell you how sad and angry I am, or this review will not be published. This DVD is a complete rip-off. Do not waste your time or money. The people who produced this DVD must learn that customers will not accept this kind of rubbish. By the way, with modern computer aided film restoration techniques, this wonderful film could have been presented in pristine condition. They just couldn't be bothered. And what's the difference between the [two] DVD versions? A clamshell case and collectable booklet? The marketing mavens are running amok. They must be stopped."
5,Excellent Copy - Brings Back Memories,"I saw movie when released. The DVD removes the lines or divisions between the 3 cinerama screens. If you like this movie, I highly recommend this set."
5,Final Cinerama Film now on Blu Ray DVD,"How The West Was Won was the last big picture made in the Cinerama 3 strip format. An all star cast travels from the East to the wild West during the early days of the pioneers.The picture is sharp and clear, and they have corrected the lines where the 3 films met together. On the second disk they have the movie presented in the Smilebox format, giving you the idea and feeling of it being presented in wrap a around Cinerama.Winner of 3 Academy Awards, remastered picture and 5.1 Dolby Digital sound there is a special feature on disk 1, the bonus: CINERAMA ADVENTURE, about the revolutinary movie exhibition process and clips of THIS IS CINERAMA & CINERAMA HOLIDAY are included.The disks are presented in a book format with information booklet inside, full of color pictures, about making the movie itself and about Cinerama.If you love classic westerns, huge all star casts, and a new clear sharp BLU RAY HD picture, this is for you."
4,"Nice, but not the best ever...","This movie is pretty good overall, but still there's minor action, like a few gunfights, one Apache encounter, and so on. I'm not saying this is bad, but I'm saying: if you really think about it, it's not the best ever made. For example, ""Chisum"" and ""Stagecoach"", which are both John Wayne movies, have way more action. Besides, why did Wayne play such a small part in this video? It would have been much better had he played a longer part. Also, if you want better movies, there are two ""Stagecoach"" movies. Watch the John Wayne one, because of the singer in the color movie. Another example is ""True Grit"", and ""Rooster Cogburn"". I won't give any more examples, because I wouldn't have a well written review. But what I can say is that you should watch this movie, and there are better ones, but this is a neat one. Enjoy!"
1,VHS tape would be better format for this film,"The transfer of this movie from it's original ""Cinerama"" format, leaves two crease lines on the screen, so it appears you are looking at a fold out poster. The characters are exagerated in how they move from the front of the screen to the rear, and back. And as a charater moves across the screen, the distance is so distorted, it is difficult to watch. This is a prime example of a motion picture that was designed for the big screen and should always be viewed that way. (One cannot view the Grand Canyon from pictures of it.) My recommendation is to steer clear of the DVD, and purchase this in a 1.33:1 VHS format for a standard TV. The widescreen transfer is such a poor quality, it should not be sold."
1,HOW THE WEST WAS LOST!,"Can anyone tell me is there a DVD copy out there ""HOW THE WEST WAS WON"" in Dolby Digital 5.1 sound???? not 2.00 stereo."
5,Two ways to view.,"I've always liked this movie, but watching it, even on a big screen at home, was somewhat strange because of the 'three camera' filming technique used making this movie. They've eliminated 95% of the three image look on the wide screen disc. The second disc allows you to view the movie in ""smile vision"". Whatever.I loved watching this movie in a level of clarity I'd not seen before. WOW!I enjoyed every minute of the experience on my 80"" screen. I even sat back and listened to every minute ofthe opening score.Get this blu-ray. If you like this movie, you'll love seeing it in this resolution."
4,"Worth Seeing, at least one","I saw this the first time longer ago than I want to recall, in the old Cinarama format. Seeing it again reminded me of just how many stars, really big name actors, participated in this epic. Given the darkness of so many films today, this movie may seem old fashioned, naive and the special effects not so special. But it is an epic, and worth seeing."
2,"Great Movie, too bad the quality is poor","It is nice to see this movie in full widescreen version again. Unfortunately, the film had apparently faded and it is very obvious in many shots that three separate cameras were used. Buy it for the classic, but don't expect much quality."
3,How the West Was Won,"I enjoyed this movie a long time ago when it came out and thought I would enjoy it again. However, it is a little dated and has not stood the test of time all that well."
2,Segmented screen,"This is a great movie, it is a shame that the edition amazon is selling appears to have been sewn together. When seen on a regular tv set, there are three movie segments, badly patched into a panoramic view. This is poor technology in our age, and it detracts enormously from the film's enjoyability. It looks like they used a ""photo stitch"" program to make the copy, and the results are poor indeed. Not recommended."
1,Very Boring,"I can never maintain interest in this movie when it gets shown on TCM. It has no drama, just an extra wide scene with admittedly very good color. Even the buffalo stampede was fairly brief and had no variation. The acting was also not the best. Whenever I watch I wonder, what's this movie about? I can never watch it long enough to find out. It's too grandiose and downright boring."
1,Blu Ray 1.33????,Come on Amazon. Look at what you are posting. How in the world would a Blu Ray DVD be presented in 1.33 format as you list in this products desciption? The blu ray version is supposed to be the first to present a quasi - cinerama experience. How about describing that?
1,How the west was NOT won,Ok: fictionalizing history a bit for the sake of entertainment is ok but this is rediculous.This movie is an insult regardles of the grandeur of it's cinematic scope or it's swollencast of movie stars. The west was won by thievery. The west was won by brutalizing thenative inhabitants. The west was won by murder and genocide and lies not this poppy-cockAmerican myth. OK OK I know it's hollywood entertainment but the sad thing is: too manyAmericans watch stuff like this and think this is how it all went down.Anyone who watches this movie should follow it up by reading Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee.I dare any of you to turn off the high-def 40 inch TV for a couple of days and read some real history.It'll hurt a bit but it's worth it.
2,Unsmiling box,"Great movie, I bought the Blu-Ray version. The only flaw was the""smilebox"" nonsense, a lame attempt to simulate the original Cineramaeffect. This was truly obnoxious. Please, next time think about creatinga version WITH and another WITHOUT this excessively cute and stunninglyuseless stupid pet trick. I will happily dump my copy in the trash whenI find the correct undamaged Blu-ray version."
1,Highly abridged,"very disappointed... This movie was so highly abridged that the life and adventures of the characters portrayed by Gregory Peck and Debbie Reynolds are totally absent. Gregory Peck does not even appear in this version, except as a photo in the old lady's locket, and the rest of the story fails to get fleshed out. It is like buying a side of beef and ending up with nothing but the hooves and horns. (where's the Beef?!) Anyone who rates this movie above 0-1 never saw the original epic movie. Total waste of my money!It has now been a long time since I viewed my ( STD) DVD but the story about the death of Jimmy Stewards character and George Papards experiences at war are omitted and everything from when he returned home to find his mother dead till his experiences as a sheriff or marshal are omitted as well. It could very well be that my DVD is just defective but the omittiion was seamless."
4,New Release Much Better,"Having owned an earlier version of this movie on DVD, the new version is so much better. They did an excellent job of removing the lines between the three cameras. What was really obvious in the different colors from frame to frame has been removed and the whole screen seems to blend together as one piece of film. Plus the surround sound is just like I remember it in the theater. The extra disc highlighting the beginning of Cinerama is very interesting. Anyone who is a fan of this movie will enjoy this Collector's Edition."
5,How The West Was Won,"A classic production, great stars, introduction of cinemascope. Good viewing on widescreen hd tv's although this is not an hd movie. Recommended for all ages."
1,ripped off,toally unacceptable--audio has an annoying background buzz--ripped off-- no doubt the seller was aware but needed the money!!
4,How the West was Won is Number One,"A masterful epic of the US in the mid-19th century, How the West Was Won is the story of two sisters, Eve and Lilly Prescott, who set out West with their family to start a farm. When their mother and father are killed in a white-water rapid, Eve stays behind to start a farm and Lilly heads to St. Louis.With a fantastic cast that includes Debbie Reynolds, Gregory Peck, Jimmy Stewart, John Wayne, and many others, this epic covers everything from the Gold Rush of 1848 to the Civil War, the Ony Express, and beyond. How America and its history touches each of the characters is only a small part of this epic film, a classic among Westerns.The only problem I had was a small one, which is why I decided to give How the West Was Won only four stars: I wasn't so fond of the unflattering and historically inaccurate way in which the Native Americans are portrayed. However, on the whole, this is a wonderful movie."
5,Smilebox format,"What a brilliant idea.This format totally re-creates the feeling you had when you saw the film in the theater. Well not exactly.more like if you were farther back in the theater.(I was always one of those nuts that sat down front)Watching the flat version although beautifully restored and in Blu-Ray,is kinda hard to watch.Especially when people on either side of the screen are having a conversation.In this new format,they actually look like they are looking at each other instead of looking all over the place. The forward moving action scenes really shine this way.Its a whole new way of looking at this film.Wouldn't it be great if they could restore all the Cinerama films thisway.At least we have the very well produced documentary that is included.I have a 52"" HiDef screen and it really made watching the filman incredible experince."
5,Spectacular!,"Wonderful video and audio; better than any previous showing I have witnessed, including the original roadshow. Smilebox version does an amazing job of imitating Cinerama and is addictive; outstanding job by technicians of minimizing three-camera lines and cleaning audio. A fun movie with an excellent cast and breathtaking cinematography. A genuine must own. I look forward to future Smilebox releases."
5,How The West Was One ( Blu-ray ),"What a great movie this is in Blu-Ray version, it's a credit to the people who have remade it to digital I highly recommend it."
1,HOW THE WEST WAS LOST TO DVD,"I was watching a promo on Turner Classics featuring directors such as Ron Howard praising the widescreen letterbox format for films, especially How The West Was Won. I purchased this DVD version of the film and felt ripped off both by Turner and Warner Brothers who released such a poorly transfered film to DVD. I remember this epic western and wanted to see the widescreen version on DVD. It was filmed with 3 cameras and you can see the seams between the 3 pictures throuighout the movie. Usually one of the 3 pictures was darker than the other 2. This was very distracting. Add film burn spots and that is enough for me to discard this DVD from my collection as unwatchable. The film deserves 4 stars, but this version only gets one star due to poor quality."
2,I remember the defects...,"This DVD rendition is difficult to watch as the very evident improperly aligned seam, the color imbalance among the three screen segments, and the the average resolution are all disruptive to the concentration of the flow of the story. What sticks in the viewer's mind are the ""defects"" mentioned above.The CINERAMA process may have worked well in the big theater screens but not for this home viewing format. This film could have been technically refurbished to clean up the ""defects"". But that would have been expensive. It is easier to make a fast buck by presenting the feature as is. What a shame!"
1,A great movie with a disastrous DVD transfer,"I have never seen such a poor representation of such a great film in a DVD format. It really sucks. The three different camera angles are so obvious and so VERY distracting, that the whole movie is painful to watch. One scene with Gregory Peck, shows his hand about three times larger than his head when he motions in the direction of the camera. My recommendation, absolutely two thumbs down. The only reason this has a one star rating, is because the online review form will not allow none at all, and I would rate it a -5."
1,CD How the West was Won,I received this new CD and when I played it the other day it kept skipping.How the West Was Won (Three-Disc Special Edition)
5,How the West was Won. A real winner.,"I really enjoyed the movie again. However, the best part of this set is the special feature on the story of the Cinerama history and process."
3,"Um. Well, it's different.","That's about all I can say. I was expecting a bit more than this. it's very small and very thin and implies more than it says. It's sort of mocking. The sofa isn't curious in the sense that it want s to know things, it's curious in the sense that there's something different about it.Definitely rated whatever you would rate your own mind, since most of the dirty stuff IS all in the implications and has little to do with the words or images. Little kids would read it and just not get it, but adults might see it a bit different.Not for kids."
1,Not at all what i expected.,Make sure that you want to buy this type of book. It was not at all what I was expecting.
3,Somewhat juvenile,"The book reminds me of a game we once played. A friend supplied a number of porno pulp novels, and we were to select two excerpts and create a third. Upon reading aloud the other players were to guess which were real and which was made up. The results were surprising, as the most vile and disturbing sequences had been contrived by the more seemingly sedate young ladies. One had to do with the freshly severed phallus of a donkey being fashioned into a hat."
3,not curious,"The sofa isn't very curious and the story isn't pornographic, but it's an interesting little book from Gorey. Only for die-hard fans."
4,The Curious Sofa and how it holds up,"I believe this is a good book but not one of Edward Gorey's finest. A must have for any fan or collecter though, don't get me wrong. We need more writers like him to keep up the dark humor in this world."
1,Very disappointed,"We purchased this camera a little over a year ago and have not had any success with it. Every picture taken of a moving object comes across blurry and our efforts to try different settings did not change the results.Now the shutter button does not work at all. Of course, we are now out of warranty. I would not suggest spending money on this product. You too will be disappointed."
2,Shutter Problem,Bought in 2001 and now the shuttler can hardly respond. Also focus is always a problem.
5,AWESOME camera...good price!,I get compliments about my pictures all the time! SO many people ask me what kind of camera I have...I tell them..and they BUY this camera!!
5,"Easy, yet advanced","This little camera is slick. My wife was very hesitant about using a digital camera. However, it only took her about 2 minutes to be completely comfortable with the Pentax 330. This camera is SO easy to use. In addition, it has some nice advanced features such as black&white and sepia settings. The other advantage is its size -- it's absolutely tiny. It fits in a pocket very easily. Picture quality has been fantastic and I've printed several from a recent ski trip -- they look every bit as good as those taken from a film-based SLR. My suggestion would be to buy an extra battery and larger CF card to take more pictures. Other than that, buy it and enjoy. No more film for us!!!"
5,Infectious and full of substance,"I picked this up on a whim when I was teaching a beginner bellydance class to people who had no previous exposure to mid or near east music. I am not a fan of mindless repetitive electronica, but I needed something to introduce a steady beat. I was increadibly surprised. This is more than just mid east pop music with a backbeat. It is well constructed and the electronic components are well integrated into traditional Turkish sound and instruments. Infectious grove, but well constructed."
4,fun modern dance mix,This is a collection of fun hip middle eastern mixes. They are great for practice workouts but I suspect they might become a bit redundant for performance.
1,"It's all been said about movie and I agree, it's at least 4 Star.","Five Stars? Well the movie is, or at least a 4 as you can see from most of the reviews. But, what we should actually be reviewing here is the product. I wish Amazon would revamp their rating system though so as not to toss all reviews for all versions of a movie into one basket. Or better yet a system that takes into account the transfer quality and format of the movie. The product in question here is a poorly transfered 4:3 standard tv format DVD which is apparently all that exists at this point. It's a 1 star product of a 4 or 5 star movie, there's no getting around that. Time for the studios to wake up, I'm tired of paying for this garbage that deserves better treatment. Even before I had a widescreen HDTV I preferred to have widescreen movies because it's more important to see ALL of the movie than to fill the screen of a 4:3 standard format TV."
1,TALL SCREEN!!!,"Ditto, all the 5-star reviews. The film is fan-f**king-tastic!But the star-rating asks ""How do you rate this ITEM?""This ""item"" violates director Fosse's original widescreen film by presenting it in ""NORMAL"" format... you know, chopped off at the sides to fit into those old, square-screen, heavy, glass, cathode ray tube TVs... remember those? No widescreen version of this DVD even exists.WTF, Warner Brothers???!!"
3,Star 80.,"Eerie true story(not sure how true in this hollywood tale) about a so-called innocent woman meeting a very problematic person, Hugh Hefner is also negatively portrayed in here and with good reason.the film is a little over-dramatic almost lifetime network dramatic or tv-movieesque. I feel there is no victim here,she knew what she was doing,And the director(Peter Bogdanvoich) who is another name in the movie, also got her killed.She should have seen the behavior when she first met him. Of course Paul Snider was evil,and no one deserves to die.and it seems he didn't care about her,only that he wasn't getting the success. Sad story about A Deranged man and what he did."
4,Pan and scan,"Amazon says this release is from 1998, and it shows. The film has been ""formatted to fit your screen"", which seldom fits a modern screen... The original format of the film is 1.85:1 (equals 16x9 with a small letterbox), but here it is presented in full frame 4x3, which would be somewhere between 1.66:1 and 1.33:1.That is too bad, but this is still the only release I know of, of this lovely film, and the picture quality is absolutely acceptable. I watch all my DVD:s with my bluray projector, and this one looks OK. Some DVD:s are so bad that they are impossible to watch on a big screen, while others are so good that they might just as well be a good bluray.The film itself was very nice to see again. It has aged well, and the growing suspense up until the horrible crime is as touching as ever. I'd love to see a restored release in the correct format on bluray, though."
4,Disturbing but good,I didn't know this movie was based on a true story wich makes it even that more chilling.This is Eric Roberts best performance.The ending will leave you shaking.A must see!
1,why get it?,"as amazing a recoding as this one is, you can only listen to it if you have a sacd player. it won't play on a normal cd player as other sacd's do, and forget about your car or discman. sony should learn from their previous mistakes and release products like this one in dual layer formats so that the few people that still buy cd's will spend $25 dollars (more than a dvd) on a record they are able to enjoy fully instead of just download or copy an inferior quality version."
1,Wretched,Some online reviews suggest that there is some merit in this CD. It features monotonous tunes played poorly with mediocre fidelity. Save your money and do not buy this.
5,Keith Jarrett shines on this album,"""What I Say"" is one Miles' greatest performances. Keith Jarrett opens it with a low down funky electric piano solo that rivals his own solo performances for passion and excitement, and Jack DeJohnette kicks it throughout."
5,"""House Rockers"", indeed","While it is interesting to hear Miles experimenting on the studio tracks, he and the crew are absolutely incendiary on the live cuts. This music is Miles as boxer: the sheer force of it will pummel you like Ali. Possibly the best live fusion there is. Hey Columbia, quit snoozing on the job and open the vaults. The entire 12/19/70 set, please!"
4,great find,This was a great find; I was not aware of this album. I was surprised at how good it is I think that it is much better than Bitches brew. The reason that I compare it to Bitches Brew is because they are from the same mode and time frame.
4,..and why not five?,"ratings are silly..but although i enjoyed live-evil when i bought it a couple years ago, having recently recieved the cellar door sessions i have to say it is far superior and really makes you question the editing work.the cellar door box is expensive, if you can afford it its a better choice and i really think its worth the money but if you can't ...you could do far worse things than listen to live-evil."
1,DONT BUY ANY HARTZ PRODUCTS,THESE PRODUCTS KILL!!!! DO NOT USE!!!!! This made my dog sick and countless others. I am so lucky he is still alive.[...] - get to know the victims and how awful this product really is.[...]Sign this petition to help get this product off our shelves.
1,Don't waste your money on this product.,"I applied the recommended dose of Hartz to my yorkie, Rambo. About a day later, he starts vomiting and gets drowsy alot. I was going to go ahead and probably get another flea and tick product for Rambo. Plus, it doesn't work. Buyer Beware. Don't waste your money!!!"
3,Pros and Cons,"I have used this product for years on my dog. It kept her clear of fleas.I could not use the cat formula, my cat proved to be alergic to it. The cat got loose and brought a crop of fleas in doors. The dog got them, with having just been treated. It was no good at getting rid of fleas. I had to take both of them to the vet and am now using the vet's recomended brand, which got rid of them in a hurry!!BarbaraWilliamsburg, Va."
5,Perfect for Flea Prevention,"I use these drops every year and must say they do the job. They are the perfect solution to use if you do not yet have fleas. They are great at PREVENTION. If you have fleas, the fleas have most likely laid eggs, and then you will need to use either these drops with the Home Spray . . or Try the UltraGuard PLUS or PRO. Both of those products kill flea eggs and larvae. Check the package for more detail.This product does exactly what it claims, does it well, and does it at a great price. Great website as well. [...]Thanks Hartz."
1,Please don't use!,"Please don't use this product on your dog. It caused liver and kidney failure with my dog. She was one of the lucky ones and pulled through, but after doing research, I've learned that this isn't out of the norm for this product and so many people have lost their pet. If you do choose to use this product, please DO NOT follow the instructions on the package and apply from their shoulders to the tip of their tail. ONLY apply it at their shoulder blades. Please learn from my mistake and don't put your pup through this."
1,DO NOT PUT ON YOUR PETS! EXPERIENCE,"i wouldnt even give it one star except i have to to review it! not only does this product not work, as soon as i put it on my 6 month old puppy, it made him very sick, he ended up unable to walk and couldnt even pick himself up off the bed in the morning...it almost killed my dog my vet told me... scrub it off with dawn dishwashing detergent and get down on their skin to get every last bit off... my vet told me the horror about hartz flea and tick products as well... its supposedly common knowledge that it kills cats, but dogs is less known... dont put this on your pets!!! apparently hartz knows of this and still has a horrible shameful person as a vet who condones putting pure pesticides that havent even been able to be used as pesticides for years! shame on them! also i put advantix on my dog a week ago after the winter and he has been perfectly fine... id recommend this, as would veterinarians"
1,BEWARE,"I used the ONE MADE FOR CATS on my cats last year and they both had a severe poisonous reaction to it! The larger cat seemed to come out of it okay after a couple hours, but the smaller one had to go to the emergency clinic, where the vet basically reprimanded me for being so stupid as to use a Hartz product!!! I was shocked that they're allowed to sell this stuff! The vet said he sees this all the time, most times it's FATAL..."
1,Please do NOT buy this product!,This is such a dangerous product! My small dog has always been so full of life and energy. After putting this product on a few days ago she has barely moved and worse yet suffered a seizure! Crazy. If you love your pet stay far away from Hartz products.
1,Dangerous--can cause terrible reaction,"My mother's dog has trouble with fleas as she lives in a heavy tourist area with dogs coming in from all over the country. She bought this as an inexpensive way to control the fleas but the reaction her poor dog had was extreme; she had to be hospitalized and extensively treated. This ""inexpensive"" treatment not only almost cost her the dog's life but she has many vet bills as well. Please do not risk your dog's health--there is no way of telling if it will react until you apply the medication!!"
1,Harmful to pets,"My dogs have been using Frontline for the last couple of years but I decided to give Hartz a try since it had been recommended to me. I applied the appropriate dosage to my Pomeranian mix (20lbs), who immediately after began exhibiting odd behavior including vomiting, and rolling her eyes back. I called up the emergency vet who told me the horrors of Hartz flea treatments. I immediately gave my dog a bath, to get the chemicals off her and drove her to the vet. Unfortunately this product can be lethal, luckily my dog recovered just fine, but not all pets are so lucky. I can't recomendmd this product."
2,wasted money and hope,"I tried this product first as it was cheaper than Frontline.I was very disappointed as it left my poor pets constantly scratching.It doesn't do what it claims, and I'd never use it again.Sorry"
1,don't use it,"I used the spray, and just got back from the Veterinary Hospital where I had to leave my Jack Russell Terrier. She had a bad reaction andis being treated. She vomited this afternoon, several times. After reading some of these comments I decided to take her in. She was in shock. HOpefully she'll survive.I'll never use a Hartz product again."
1,This Kills,"Hartz products have a long history of causing lethal reactions in pets. Unfortunately a friend of mine used this product with very bad results. The two pets did not make it through the night.Please be sure to google 'Hartz Kills' to see the information on class action lawsuits and numerous websites with further information.These products, drop on the neck, flea collars by Hartz, etc all have the same ingredients. So even if you don't use this particular product the results might be the same. So for this reason I would caution against using any of Hartz's flea and tick products."
1,didnt work,i used all 3 doses and no results so i went and purchased the expensive stuff and voila no more flees.
1,does not work,i applied this to my dogs thinking i'd see how well it worked. They were flea-free at the beginning of the month but picked up fleas while on Hartz. I immediately switched them back to pet armour (the frontline knock-off) and it cured the flea problem in 24 hours.
1,"Do not buy this, it kills dogs!","I am so angry! I used it on my 5 year old dog today, and he died! Hartz doesn't want to help dogs, they want to kill them!"
1,POISONING PETS,"DO YOURSELF A FAVOR, and check this website before you think about using this product on your pet:[...]This company has been peddling this garbage as a worthy substitute to actual, helpful flea medications, and prolonged use will likely result in the death of your furry friend because of harmful pesticides. I used this on my dog, and within the first hour he had it on, he began vomiting and limping, and wouldn't eat. I had to shave him, bathe him three times, and spend lots of money at the vet to make him better, and that's only because we got lucky and caught it before he was too far gone. If you care at all, you'll just spend a few extra bucks and buy something from your vet that won't result in the premature death of a pet you care a lot about."
1,"This made my shih tzu VERY ILL, Google it","After applying this to my little shih tzu, he became very sick, agitated, and aggressive. He seemed to be unable to breathe properly and acted as if he were hallucinating. I googled the product and found HUNDREDS of reports of Hartz products killing and injuring dogs. They have been reprimanded by the EPA and contain harmful poisons. Yes, most flea and tick meds are literally pesticides, but other brands are much, much safer for your pet. I am outraged Hartz products are sold anywhere! For the safety of your beloved pet, google this before you purchase and apply this to any living creature. If you have applied it already, bathe the dog immediately with a powerful dish soap and contact your vet if it exhibits alarming symptoms."
1,Read This Before U Buy,"In 2005, the EPA canceled permission to use phenothrin in several flea and tick products, at the request of the manufacturer, Hartz Mountain Industries.[1][2] The products were linked to a range of adverse reactions, including hair loss, salivation, tremors, and numerous deaths in cats and kittens. In the short term, the agreement called for new warning labels on the products.As of March 31, 2006, the sale and distribution of Hartz's phenothrin-containing flea and tick products for cats has been terminated. However, EPA's product cancellation order did not apply to Hartz flea and tick products for dogs, and Hartz continues to use phenothrin in a concentration of 85.7% in many of its flea and tick products for dogs.[3]I bought this as a quick solution, and thank heavens I read reviews before applying to my beautiful Yorkie. <3"
1,No Good!!,Does not work at all!! Don't waste your money on this.I used 2 applications in a 2 week time frame and it still didn't work. Spend a little more money and get something better.
1,** WARNING** Please do not use this product on your pet!,"Hartz flea and tick drops have been reported to BURN pets skin, cause seizers, vomiting, and sometimes death.Dont believe me, google it... there are tons of web sites and pictures of pets with hairless burns down their back from using this product.If you love your pet, dont go cheap!!! Get a vet recommended product.[...][...]"
1,DO NOT USE,This product does not work at all!!!! There are always live ticks found on our dog. They are found on the belly side but also in the line of medication on his back - WASTE OF MONEY!!!!
1,hartz products are deadly,"about 3 days after using the hartz flea and tick drops on my 2 dogs they began throwing up and lost their appetite. I began examning several possibilities and after reading reviews of the product online, i now know exactly what it was. So buyer be ware. If you have any doubts then just google problems with Hartz products or go to hartzvictims.org and read about all these other people loosing their cats and dogs due to hartz products."
1,Was not effective for my dogs.,I suppose this stuff is cheap enough for anyone to try once and it is easily found at most stores. I have two indoor dogs with no yard(townhouse) that do take daily walks and spend time at a dog park. I used this product after I noticed a few fleas on my lighter dog. It was cheaper than other products and I was at the pet store to get some flea shampoo so I decided to try it out since the vet was closed at the time. I used a dose on each dog and it has been about two weeks and they are still scratching all the time and I can see the fat fleas crawling on them. I do vacuum daily and keep their bedding clean so fortunately the fleas are only on them and not all over the house. All in all you get what you pay for and the stuff is cheap in price and value. I will be going back to the more expensive stuff for the health and comfort of my dogs.
1,Stay away!!!,Almost killed my dog. STAY AWAY. research online! Hartzvictims.org. Had about $1000 in vet bills!!!! The vet told me she sees lots of these cases every year. The cat stuff is even worse!!!
1,Don't do it,"The drops made my pug really sick, I am praying he doesn't end up with major organ damage.Times are really difficult, and you try to take care of your pet the best you can, thedecision to buy the cheap stuff ends up having a devastating backlash. Insult to injury,just when you think things could not get any worse, corporate inhumanity comes through again.nice"
1,flea medication,"I can't be 100% posistive, but I put the medication on my little buddie and less than 24 hours later he died! All I can say is just do the research!"
1,Horrible Reaction,"I can't believe this is still on the market. I used once on my dog and he had a horrible skin reaction that lasted for days. His skin became red and irritated, he wouldnt let me come near him, and was whimpering. Even after repeated washings he was sore to the touch. I now use frontline or get the Rx for first shield. Do NOT buy if you care about your pets health."
1,Hartz kills not only fleas but pets too,Read these two websites for very sad stories of how Hartz products have killed pets:http://www.hartzvictims.org/http://www.hartzkills.org/More sites to read to become informed:http://www.nrdc.org/health/effects/pets/execsum.asp
1,Garbage!,"Used on my 10 pound poodle. Within a few days had fleas again. Two weeks into treatment had a tick! He's four years old and has never had a tick. This product is absolutely worthless! Not to mention, after putting it on him, he ran around the house like a nervous wreck for 24 hours and salivated a lot. I felt terrible! Never again!!!! I wrote the company a letter and they sent me a form letter reply, telling me to send them the unused portion and original receipt for refund. That's it. No, ""we're sorry you were disappointed,"" nothing."
5,Good!!!!!!,I received when they told me I was supposed to be receiving. Satisfied with it and I will buy more!
1,This product can KILL your pet!,"Sure, it's not guaranteed to kill your pet but it CAN. I now have two friends whose dogs have died from a serious reaction after using this product. Even if 2 out of 100 dogs dies, it simply is not worth taking that chance. What if your dog is one of those two? Not worth the gamble."
1,It cost me $53.00 to groom my dog after using this junk.,I bought the Hartz Ultra Guard Plus for my Wheaten Terrier at Walmart. She weighs in at 34 pounds. I bought it because it was inexpensive and I thought Walmart would sell a decent product. I applied it and two days later it looked like I had poured Cooking oil all over my dogs back. In between the shoulder blades down to her tail was oily and wet. A few days later dirt had been absorbed into the oil making her look a mess. I couldn't get the stuff out. I ended up taking her to Petsmart to be groomed and they had to use a special shampoo to cut through the oil.So what I thought was going to be a savings actually cost me $53.00 for a grooming. I don't know if the Ultra guard actually worked because no one wanted to pet her because her coat was such a mess.Look elsewhere for your flea a tick needs. This one definately isn't worth it.
4,Triumphant Tragedy,"If you're unaware of the oil industry and how it's run outside the halls of Exxon, Mobil, etc., this book will be an eye-opener for you. It's how the oil business really works, including an historical perspective, and the greed that inevitably tears families apart. Well written with good timing of events. Little details provide real incite into the hearts of the characters. Very enjoyable, despite the ending of a family split apart by too much money."
2,hacking,"i like movies concerning computers and hacking,but this movie did not do it for me.nothing like sneakers or hackers.it is based on a true story,but moves a little too slow for me."
4,Captivating,This book held my attention. The plot was well executed and the book well written. Goldman's ways of describing details pulled everything together.
4,Great book,"Joel Goldman gets your attention and keeps it. A real page turner. Highly recommended, will read more of this authors books."
1,"I *did* manage to finish it, but just barely","Terrible writing, with terrible editing to go along with it -- there were passages where it appeared that two different draft paragraphs were left in. But the real problems were:- One-dimensional characters- Zero-dimensional plot- Dialog that was horribly cliche- Not a single legal machination in a ""legal thriller""Other than THOSE, however, a fine book: it had pages and print.VERY disappointing, given previous reviews."
4,"Good read, just takes a little time to move!","When I began reading this story, it moved very slowly. I like a little more speed in my suspense and mystery. The book picked up after about 100 pages and moved at a pace that I like to read. I was happy with the pacing after that point and for those who like a slower pace at first and speed towards the end, this is a good book for you."
1,Too Much Profanity,"Story line was great but there was too much profanity for me to recommend the book to anyone. The book in itself was so good that I would love to order all of the Lou Mason books, but I'm just not comfortable with all of the profanity, which wasn't needed and added nothing of value to the story."
3,motion to kill,An interesting read. This story did not require any deep analysis but pleasantly passed the time. Fast paced with good character development.
4,Motion to kill,It was very good story telling but confusing trying to keep some of the characters straight and the bad guy only shows up at the end out almost no where.
4,I am addicted to Lou Mason,Loved it! I have read all of the Lou Mason's books and will definitely read books to come. Great read.
2,An eclectic pulling from the past who dunnits,"I'm only half way through. It's not bad enough for me to discontinue reading. But I get the feeling that I have read or seen it before, in the movies. A hodge podge of Earle Stanley Gardner, Barry Reed and others. A far cry from Grisham. Some portions are very readable. Many are not. I would not buy another one of the franchise."
2,NOT comparable to Michael Connelly,"Goldman is a lawyer so I suppose the legal issues in the plot are authentic. Beyond that, his writing is full of cliches, his dialog ranges from ho hum to juvenile, and his main character rarely behaves or thinks like an adult - more like a smart ass college freshman. I suspect Goldman writes fast and lets the words spill from his brain with very little attempt at craftsmanship. Comparing him to Michael Connelly is like comparing airplane food to fine dining. No more Goldman books for me."
1,Flabbergasted,"How anyone could rate this book above 1 much less 5 is beyond me. Strewn with names, not characters, who appear with the barest introduction, not development, left me totally confused before I was half way through which was as far as I got before I trashed it. It belongs to the dime novel genre and is no bargain even at 99 cents. The abundance of 5 star ratings calls the value of such into question. If you check the raters other ratings you will find that not one of them has ever read anything other than a 5 star book!"
5,Could not put down!,"I downloaded this as a freebie and before I was done, I was ordering the rest of the series. If you are a fan of fast paced legal thrillers you will not be disappointed, no matter what the price. You get a real good sense of the characters and the main character has a great sense of humor. I noticed in the other books I purchased that some of the characters carry thru to the others in the series. This is a must read!"
5,Kept me guessing.,Really interesting twists and turns. Plenty of good characters. I liked the main character and his quick wit. He grew with the story making me like him more. I found this book by chance but now I will read more by this author.
3,motion to kill Joel Gldman,first time I have read this author it was okay but did not keep me wanting to go back and read will try another one
4,Read this one!,It is a fast read -- keeps the reader interested. Hard to put down. I would recommend reading this thriller.
3,Good plot,This book has a good plot and leaves out extraneous characters so the reader is not bogged down in useless extras. Characters lack depth and need personalities developed more. Plot is good but could use more descriptions and better flow.
3,"Idea Book, thats all","I expected to get more than ideas, but that all you'll find in this Tory Worobiec book. Very few details on how-to, and most are topics already covered in previous books."
3,"It's all wrong, Mommy","My kindergartener is a kid who desperately *wants* glasses. She checked it out of her school library and read it all by herself. The big disappointment for her is that Arthur looks different in the book than on the cover. She kept commenting how it was all wrong.Arthur gets glasses, but his friends tease him. He decides not to wear them, but that causes him all sorts of problems. Finally, his teacher shows him how cool glasses are. Arthur wears them, does well in school and sports; and his friends change their mind. They like glasses, also!This is a good book for children who are hesitant to wear their glasses. It's also great for kids like mine. The words are a little long, so I wouldn't give it to the earliest readers. I'd say it's about first grade level. Younger kids might like having an adult read it to them.Just beware of the cover. It's confusing to the kids."
