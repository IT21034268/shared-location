3,"A GOOD BOOK, BUT WATCH OUT!","Farley's book is good with some caveats. 1) Know your indicators in advance - this is not a beginner book. 2) Be prepared for an unorthodox (difficult) prose style. 3) Like everything else, confirm what you can of what he shows you.Case-in-point - page 205's graph of Farley's original Accumulation-Distribution Accelerator has a post-dictive error. The indicator displays signals earlier than it really would (I plotted this in TradeStation myself, and it doesn't match up). You can confirm this by looking at the 1st apex (most left) of the indicator and see it spikes BEFORE the price does, because it is actually using THE FOLLOWING DAY'S ""long-range day"" volume in the calculation. This means the subplot indicator is actually left-shifted by at least 1 bar, giving a false impression on its early-signal ability.Some good nuggets though, if you examine the book carefully."
1,Very hard to read,"I'm an attorney and couldn't get anything out of this. I've read just about every major book on TA and this just was not up there. I wouldn't waste the money. I've borrowed it from the library on 2 occassions thinking it was just me the first time -- not the case. Like someone else said, it looks impressive but good luck trying to get anything substantive out of it."
1,Psychotic Rambling....,"I agree with one of the reviewers who pointed out the anti-social nature of the author. I also agree that the author's self ""selling points"" are simply a modern copy of the ""emperor's new clothes"".I noticed that majority of the posters claimed that this ""master's text"" is incomprehensible. As a matter of fact, I believe that the entire book are just the psychotic rambling. So why bother even to read it!?"
2,So profound....,"Alexander Elder has warned in his ""Come into my trading room"" to avoid trading books written in poor English, as person's writing reflects his thinking. Farley's book is a perfect example of the above. The book is full of ""profound"" wisdom like:""Compare price placement within that axis against volume's central tendency deviation to identify impending feedback shifts""Meaningless truisms also contribute to the 400+ pages solidness of the volume:""Profits depend on relationship between price and time""""Good results make money, while bad results lose it""While the book may still offer some insights and useful techniques, one would need a fine sieve to locate them.Both main Elder's books are by far superior to this."
1,Very disappointing,The book is badly written and difficult to understand and to follow even for graduated people. All thinks are put inside without any logical framework. The reader get lost after some pages.The book is too long and worth of nothing interesting.Avoid to waste money for this book. I bought one copy kidded by the high rating and looking for some good insight in swing trading.
2,Frustrating !!,"This book is sadly disappointing. There are some good ideas that you can gleen from this text but overall I would save the money and avoid it for other more professionally written books (ie. Schwager stuff). Reading this tome is akin to wading through a quagmire of well meaning but ill structured ideas and concepts. I kept thinking that Farley is writing in a schizophrenic, stream-of-conciseness style as the text wandered aimlessly. Randomly, good ideas would jump disjointedly from the droning text and I would highlight them but in the end though, it was a chore to finish, and a book not enjoyed is hard to follow and retain. Sorry Farley."
1,More Swinging than Trading,"I found this book a huge disapointment. It is a cluttered collection of old time chart theory expressed in endless verbocity. This book could well be titled ""Never use 50 words when 500 will do"". There is lots of warm and fuzzy language such as ""letting your left and right brain connect"" and ""feeling for the space of emptiness"". HAS THIS GUY EVER TRADED!!There is no original research and no objective measurement or system testing of the various strategies discussed. That the author claims to have ""discovered"" some new arcane theory of market pattern is simply not substantiated.I have never even thought of returning a book to Amazon before but this one made me do it!!!. This book is simply out of place in a serious traders library."
5,Very Thorough Piece of Work,"This book offers a great one-shot reference to the vast array of swing trading tactics. This may be the only book to achieve this so far. The mathematics are kept simple and there is a strong focus on pattern reading. Not everyone's cup of tea, but certainly mine. I would have liked more formulas and indicators in the text, but you can't have everything.This is not for beginners because it assumes a lot of prior knowledge. Most traders I talk to who have read it either love it or hate it. I definitely found it memorable and right on the money. It introduces readers to market forces that other writers have chosen to ignore. I believe the insights are accurate and very humbling.In my opinion, Farley's book is the most in-depth and informative book to come out on the topic. As someone who has studied the markets for the better part of two decades, I learned a lot from this book."
3,Smart but doesn't know how to write,"This book is packed with lots of information, and that's good. The problem is that Farley doesn't know how to write clearly. In my opinion, clear writing is what you get from Dr. Alexander Elder or Toni Turner. For all I know, Farley knows more than they do, but he seems to be too inclined to use esoteric words that cloud what he is trying to say. After you finish reading a paragraph or page, you have no idea of what he was trying to say. I read these trading books very carefully and take notes. When I go back to my notes of his book, there is nothing there but random, unconnected thoughts. You know why? Because that's the way he writes. I am not saying don't buy it; it may be useful for somebody. But if you do by it, be prepared to sift through a rambling prose."
3,Master Swing Trader,"The book isn't for beginners and is somewhat hard to follow. Often, the writer talks about his opinions without giving clear techniques to follow. If you are an experienced trader, there are few good gems in this book."
4,Great Book to avoid danger,"New traders and recently burn ones will find this book to be very useful, It helps you to better understand the techniques used by successful traders, great to avoid some mistakes in being a fad (all buying or all selling trader) instead of a swing (understand when to get in and why) trader, remember that the trend is your friend and not jump into a highly volitile trend that is most likely to reverse. My congrats to Mr. Farley... and what a great site..."
1,Don't waste your money on this book!,"This book is poorly written, piled up with a lot of junk orderlessly.I could not find anything useful in the entire book. It wasted my money. I trashed my copy!If you really want to learn how to trade and NOT lose your money, go ahead with the ""High Probability Trading"" by Marcel Link (2003)."
4,Trader,Mr. Farley is obviously an experienced and probably successful trader. He is one of the more knowledgable writers I have read on trading. His book is through and detailed.I have only one criticism. Mr. Farley has a talent for taking a fairly simple function and making it sound complicated.This book would make an excellent college text.
1,I regret this buying,"I've tried to read this books serveral times but I can't keep reading more than 15 minutes. It is not well organized at all.Graphics are not commented in the text like any good book out there. You have just some lines over the graph and that's all. Obviously, often you don't understand what the autor means.There may be something interesting inside but it's definitely unreadable.I have to recognize that it's the worst compared to other books I've bought (Alexander Elder, Martin Pring, Steeve Nison, Van Tharp, Mark Douglas, Jake Bernstein).I cannot understand other reviews giving 5 stars."
1,Opprobium for this Abundant Obfuscation,"A very badly written book, filled with conjecture, backed up by no research whatsover. The author blathers on about patterns retracing back to Fib numbers, yet offers no proof other than the occasional ""well chosen example."" In fact, the month I was reading this book, there was an article in Active Trader magazine which went through thousands of charts and showed that retracements do not magically fall to magic numbers. This book reads like an astrological textbook.Reader after reader talks about how they have had to go through it again and again. That's because it's a.) poorly written, b.) illogically ordered and c.) the damn charts are often on the wrong page. And the way this guy draws trendlines -- jeez, they could be anywhere!Color me not impressed."
2,Interesting but not Practical,"You can't automate much of these suggestions and, as a result, you can't backtest their performance. I think that most traders use computer scanning to find candidates so this book won't help. If you trade just a few stocks, commodities, etc., these might help."
1,How much time was spent editing this book?,"Farley covers a ton of ground in this book but it is simply a horrible read. It seems like he sat down and wrote the 400+ pages without any outline. He is all over the place. The subject headings mean almost nothing. He will write a few lines on the specified topic but start to wander off and end up on a topic he has already mentioned half a dozen times.This guy also needs a thesaurus. He seems to have a very limited vocabulary and by the end of the book you are left wondering why he can't mention an indicator without calling it ""classic"" or go a paragraph without explaining the market using the words ""greed"" and ""fear."" Avoid this book."
2,Buying this book is not a great investment,"This book is poorly written: it is unfocused and repetitive. In addition, I am not convinced its content is scientifically sound."
5,A Must Read for the Swing Trader!,"I just finished The Master Swing Trader and I am greatly impressed. Alan Farley provides the specific trade setups and information that is so often lacking in today's trading books. Farley is giving information that I have not found elsewhere. So many trading books are overly-hyped and a waste of time. This book is a seasoned market professional passing on the wisdom of his vast experience in the stock market, and I highly recommend it."
1,"Instant Garbage, Clasic Waist","I give this book a minus ten (the lowest)rating. My personal opinion about the book is very simple: that it LIES, and IT LIES A LOT.It is advertized BY THE AUTHOR that this book presents:* Dozens of specific trading strategies.......******** The 7 Bells....The fact is that there is nothing specific about anything in this book. THE REASON??? According to the author and his hired ""defender(s)"": THE MARKET IS SO ""VOLATILE"", SO ""DYNAMIC"", the ""MASTER"" IS INCAPABLE OF defining anything specifics, let alone any ""SPECIFIC TRADING STRATEGIES"". Then what people should call the advertizing??According to their line of explanations as presented in the book and by some of the ""reviewers"" on this web site, if you bring in 1000 stock charts, the ""master"" can manufacture 1000 bells for ya. I call it a classic laughingstock. So good luck to anyone who wishes to read this book."
2,A very long and confusing book,I am very disapointed at this book. The author goes around in circles forever not making any point clear. I spent over 150 hours on this book. Did I learn anything of value? Unfortunately the answer is no.
2,"Try and try again, or Cry and cry again?","There's no question in my mind that the author has an incredible amount of knowledge about trading. The book does give ""some"" good pointers. However, reading through it is probably one of the most painful experiences I have ever encountered. I've been trading for some time and have read several books on trading and technical analysis. But this has got to be the worse I have ever read. Most, if not all, the chapters/sections in this book had to be re-read at least 2 to 3 times. What the hell was the editor/pulisher thinking about when they decided to release this book? If you cutout half of the BS and the proverbial trading jargon/slang, you'd probably have a half decent book with insightful info. You would also have a book that is at least 250 pages light.I'm throwing in the towel. I decided not to even keep it as a reference because it is just so incomprehensible. I'm returning mine asap.Sorry Farley!"
3,"OK, but not great","A good book with pearls of wisdom but, let's face it, Farley has a pretty stilted writing style. Aggrandizing the language doesn't make it better, just harder to chew and digest. Being direct would probably have halved the thickness of the book (and maybe the price?) For some straight-forward writing, read something by DeMark."
3,Good Charts! Bad Writing!,"The first time you flip through this book you think, ""Wow! I've never seen so many candlestick setups and charts!"" The problem comes when you actually curl up and try to read this montrosity. The book is like a bag of Olean potato chips: taste good at first but impossible to digest. Oh, there are some nuggets here and there that are useful and informative; there are some passages on selected candlestick setups that can actually be used to trade with. The problem is that you have to wade through some heavy, turgid, dense and sometimes nonsensical prose to get there. You've been warned."
1,A 'Classic' Bubble,"We all witnessed a period of stock market bubble. This book can be viewed as a mouldy residual, a truely worst residual from that period. If you ever spent any time on internet stock message boards, and felt disgusted by those greed, fears, hypes and whining, you will find out that all those emotional garbages again in this book, only dressed in various kind of uncommon 'terminologies' which the author even does not understand himself. Apparently, those web messageboard posters and that kind of mentality are exactly the target and intended audiences of this author. In this sense, the best I could say about this book is that I consider it a product of that peiord and phenomena in stock market history. If anyone has to call it a 'classic', then I could only consider it a 'classic' bubble, at its worst."
1,I smell a rat,Something tells me all those five star reviews were written by the same person. The big question is (All you Sherlock Holmeses out there): who?
2,Master Swing Trader,"The topics covered in the book are indeed varied to the extent that certainly the major swing trade techniques are identified. This is not an introductory text on the subject and is not necessarily useful as a reference due to the lack of specific examples and guidance. As simple as it may seem, a better reference on the subject of technical analysis and swing trading techniques is Technical Analysis for Dummies. While the mathematics for a vast majority of the techiques presented in the text may appear dry and uninteresting, more sample problems and a ""big picture"" approach would certainly have helped this book get the point across to the trader who wants to employ any number of methods to minimize the emotion factor when trading stocks. Leave this book on the bookseller's shelves."
5,"Many patterns, many trading truths.","This book will help any trader seeking a deeper understanding of the fundamentals of swingtrading. The patterns and their explanations are deep and varied with many charts and step by step trade management examples. The last chapter is worth reading and re-reading. Entitled ""Precise Trade Execution"" it deals with entering and managing trades. So many trading books talk about patterns and indicators. But most fail to ever bridge the gap from paper trading excitement, to the realities of getting filled, with the fakeouts, whips, and shake 'n bake's that are the everyday reality of a swingtrader. If I could have read Chapter 15 a few years ago, it would have greatly accelerated my path to profitability."
1,Definitive Prerequisite,"I actually rate this book at -5 starts. I believe that it is absolutely necessary for anyone who wish to start reading this ""book"" to read (or re-read) the story ""The Emperor's New Suit"" by Hans Christian Andersen first.I believe that most honest people would feel outrageous by this kind of BS and total waists of money and time."
1,Truly an over-rated book..,"I was curious about reviewing this book based on the varying opinions here and popularity (as evidenced by the amazon sales rank ..)It is a book about mainly the application of technical analysis to trade stocks. But having studied TA I would hesitate to recommend this book to learn.Some snipets of wisdom here and there I can't deny. I think the appeal of this book was the timeliness of it's writing along with the bull markets in tech stocks. Most of the examples were in companies that were highflyers during those times. I think it would be dull and much less appealing after the huge subsequent decline in the Nasdaq.Having said that, and as serious as I am about trading, I'll skip on owning this book. I'll focus my energy on other authors' work."
1,What a total waste of money and time....,"This is most awful book I have ever read on any subject. The style, if you can call that, is total rambling, repeating vague and general statements over and over. Every page is filled with that kind of garbage.I had to read and read sentences and paragraphs several times to make some sense out of them, with little success. How can anyone rate this book 4 or 5 stars and call it excellent work.The impressive looking charts are over-complicated, confusing and mostly meaningless.This was a frustrating reading, especially that I wasted so much time trying to understand something that wasn't there....What a rip!..."
1,WOW...just wow,"What a horrible book. The writing style of the author is horrendous! Impossible to follow or even comprehend what he is trying to teach. All the information in this book is readily available online. Save your money and buy ""Mastering the trade"" by Scott instead."
3,Solid book. Incomprehensible English makes unreadable,"The book appears to contain a lot of wisdom. I only wished I could make the information my own. My on-and-off efforts in reading this book have been thwarted by the author's very distinctive style of writing, which is very difficult to read. Within a paragraph there is insufficient flow from sentence to sentence. On the one hand, the author likes to use inanimate abstract nouns as subjects for his sentences; ""Narrow range tactics enter positions..."". On the the other hand, he likes to weave in imperative sentences; ""Stay away from small penants and ..."". To decipher the cryptic messages will take too much effort and time. Good substance, but marred by an inhospitable writing style."
1,"He may know his stuff, but does not know how to teach it.","I bought this book two years ago. I tried reading it many times, but always end up putting it down. There's a lot of content in the book, but it's scattered everywhere. This book is not well organized. My train of thought keeps getting interrupted by the ordering, reordering and repeating of topics. I can hardly keep my concentration. His sentences are very cryptic. Information does not flow well in his writing style. I also feel that the book is very wordy and repetitive. It can be cut down to 1/3, and still probably retain the same amount of information.One thing I find very odd is that this book is very highly rated (4-5 stars) when it first came out. But now, bad reviews are popping up at an alarming rate. I suspect that someone might have been stuffing the ballot when the book first came out to boost its sales."
1,Bad writer,"It is amazing to me that the many page book is so full of information worded to never say anything. After every paragraph I ask myself what the heck did he just say, and although with effort it is understandable the reader has to work much harder than should be necessary. The material covered is not that complicated. It is just very poorly writen."
2,Confusing writing,"I was looking forward to this book as I follow his trading writings in ""Real Money"" and he puts forward good stuff there.However there is a ""style"" to his writing in this book that makes the content difficult to follow. His sentences are truncated and tend to flip from idea to idea all within a single paragraph, such that you need to keep going back and reread in order to follow what he is trying to say. From Real Money I know he is very knowledgable about swing trading, but you will find this book frustrating. Maybe it required a better editor. ..."
2,No substance,"There are some good principles in the book, but its way to easy to get lost in all of the repetition and blandness. The section on fibonocci retracements was useful and seems to work well for me in practice; however, I didn't get much else from the book."
5,Made me trade better,"Mr Farley has written an outstanding book that requires commitment by his reader. The materials are multidimensional. In other words, there are often several ideas or concepts to be gained from each piece of his presentation. The end result, for me at least, was a rebuilding of my trading style, attack approach and overall performance. I am a lot closer to my goal of trading for a living now than ever before. I have to thank this book for a lot of the progress."
1,Too hard to read,"Text is too flowery to read - I just gave up everytime I read a few paragraphs. Trading concepts are not of the KISS (keep it simple, stupid) type variety - so, not very easy to apply."
5,Excellent but very technical,"For all traders and investors. Swing trading teaches great entry points and profit management.I've been a swing and trend trader for years now with a vast library of TA books. This book is the best I've ever read.Not the type of book for a beginner, I suggest ligher reading until you get to know the basics of oscillators, trend lines, volume characteristics etc...If you know the basics, this will propel you to 3 levels above.Carefull reading will reap profits. It did for me.Take time reading this book, use a hylighter, bookmark pages, go back to them from time to time.CAUTION! This book is written in a college textbook fashion with higher mathematical terminology. It wouldn't hurt to read the book with an engineering dictionary or a good math site.Although some techniques did not fit the present day environment, I know they will fit future environments.I found the advice very sound and profitable.This is a TA encyclopedia! Awesome book."
1,Great trader horrible book.,"Alan knows short-term trading in and out. I have never seen his trading records, but I think this man is one of the greatest traders of our time.But the book is a great disappointment. Very little desire on the part of the author to get down to the level of audience and make things simple."
5,Excellent book for all types of traders!,"I would vote this one my favorite of all analysis books I have read. At the time I read it, it seemed to incorporate everything together. I have kept mine close by my computer and have referred to it many times.At the prices I have seen - it is a Must Read!"
3,Not bad but there are better choices,The problem with books like this is the author gives you a few concepts and ideas but in practice they may not work. I prefer using powerinvestor.com and their Triple Test and investment models. Their system generate only a few trades a year and the returns over the past 7 years have averaged over 30% a year. Less work and better returns.
2,Did Goerge Bush write thisbook?,Did an editor even read this book for grammer mistakes? While I believe it has some valuable ideas it truely is delivered on perhaps an elementry school level. I was not impressed. You pay good money for a book and you expect that the ideas presented are at least digestable
1,Do not buy this book,I return this book after a week of reading.In my opinion this book is so hard to understand that it is not suitable for me.I am a professional stockbroker and like to read books especially trading books.
2,excellent - meant to put 5 starts,"By far, of all the books I read regarding the stock market, this was the most useful. This book is well worth the money. Author explains in great deal his view on many of the various stock analysis tools/ideas."
1,Very Poorily Written,Very hard to follow and decipher. Information provided was not organized and sounded like gobbledegook. The author makes no attempt whatsoever to report proof but just shows his one example. Don't waste your time.
1,Give my money back!!!!!!!!,"I don't want to give a single star to this ""book"". I am feeling really sorry for spending time to read this BS. I would definitely want to return this ""book"" and get my money back."
5,"Without a Doubt, Farley is an Expert",Best book on trading I've read. This book has far more value to readers with significant trading experience than to beginners.
1,"Lots of hype, but little substance","I was drawn to this book by the title, ""Master Swing Trader.."", and the 4 star review. The pretentious writing style has eluded me and probably quite a few other readers.After a last try in sloughing off the hype, I do not see any real substance apart from the artful adorning of commonplace technical analysis terms. This may be seen from the description of candlestick patterns as finger finders, and retracements as dip trips.The charts look sharp. But overall, a disappointment."
2,Didn't even Finish the Book,"This book was too abstract for a trading book and didn't have much substance. There really isn't much you can use in this book to actually make trades with. Farley is basically a legend in his own mind I think. If you want a good book that has a lot of substance and will actually teach you how to trade, get 'how to profit in bull and bear markets' by stan weinstein, I consistantly make money from the techniques and ideas in that book. Take care, Bob."
1,This book is for retarded,"I meant to put no stars on this book at all.The author can't even write more than two sentences before running into some concepts which he could not understand or could not explain. Same thing happened in all those ""admiring"" comments on this board. Either they are just hired pumpers, or they could only ramble on something they could not understand just like the author himself did in this book.DO NOT WAIST TIME OR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE."
1,This book not for the Experienced trader or even the beginner.,"I didn't even finish it. 1/3 of the way through I had enough of his ego and lack of defined technique. The writing style is poor compared to the library of books behind me at my desk. Sounded too much like some of the get rich quick books out there. Save your money buy something with real stats and no ego, like Nison, Bulkowski, or Murphy."
2,Where is the beef?,"I have been trading for 20 years. I just finished reading this book. I find a lot information useful. But where is the beef? After finishing the last page, a young trader wouldn't understand what he should do next. I also find the language used is sometimes, very confusing ( to many fancy words and lack of simplicity). I guess, the author assumes that everyone alse understands the material as well as he does! Question: did this book add anything new to what I already know? the answer: not much."
2,Tedious,"Reading this book is simply tedious. I am only half way through it but it is just too tough to actually keep reading. Every sentence is a command, i.e. - follow the indicator, wait for the turn, buy the strength...There are no two sentences that actually relate to one another, just a bunch of mumbo-jumbo. I think he touches on most TA concepts but to understand what he's saying would absolutely take a Captain Crunch decoder ring."
2,a disappointment,"I do think there is some worthwhile content here...not very much, but some. It would be hard to ramble for 400 pages and not spew forth something useful. Farley's writing style is lengthy and needlessly confusing, with emphasis on needlessly. An example...when discussing triangle formations, he states 'Well-formed triangles gather tremendous predictive power because they point directly at negative-positive feedback interfaces.' Find an editor...please. That's his way of saying you can expect a significant price move on the breakout of a well-formed triangle. And the ENTIRE book is written this way...i could have used hundreds of examples. If you buy this book, prepare to be frustrated."
2,Hazy Subshine,"I rated MST two stars because the prose reminds me of Kung Fu's Shaolin Monk, Kwai Chang Caine. Unlike John Murphy, Alexander Elder and Steve Nison, Mr. Farley fails to clearly communicate his ideas and the writing is verbose. I read the entire book, learned a few new things but it was like panning for gold. After reading the book, I then enrolled in his online course hoping to make more sense of his system. The experience was worse. His charts were erroneous and in audio, he contradicted himself. When I emailed him about the errors, he grew impatient and conveyed an imperious attitude. Like a child, he complained that I was nitpicking and then terminated my membership although he gave me a full refund."
2,Better swing trading books...,"I have to agree with many other reviewers that the writing style of this book is so poor that I think I was missing some important and worthwhile information. Dave Landry wrote two books on swing traders that are far easier to understand and implement. I think someone who has never invested before -- much less traded -- wouldn't have problems reading ""Dave Landry on Swing Trading."" As someone with experience with the markets, I found myself rereading ""Master Swing Trader"" passages 2 and 3 times."
1,It is a garbage collector,This book does not deserve any star at all.I cannot believe the publisher had ever published such a garbage collector. What a waste!
1,Don't Bother With This One,"This book is one of the worst I've read on trading. Be warned, it will be a nightmare to read if you are a novice. If you are advanced on this topic, you will quickly realize that it leads the reader from one dead end to another. Too many words and too much filler makes the whole thing unprofessional. It has the feel as if it was put together in a haphazard way - paragraph after paragraph full of general statements on trading that often don't even fit together. It's very important to keep in mind that a LOT of these authors of trading books make a living off of selling trading books, DVDs, and subscriptions. Because, frankly, they can't make a living from trading."
3,The Master Swing Trader,"Whilst I am sure there are some pearls of wisdom contained in this book it is an extremely difficult book to read as a result of the language and phraseology used.In addition many Figures/illustrations are used without reference in the body of the text and the reader is left to try and decipher what is presented without any real assistance.I was referred to this text as the bible of swing trading and I am really quite disappointed with the outcome as it is poorly written when the subject matter demands direct non-flowery statements. Each page is filled with flowery, emotive statements that are confusing and poorly directed.I would not recommend this book to any one wanting to get a meaningful understanding of swing trading."
4,"Not an easy read, but still very useful","I bought this book a couple of months ago. I agreed with many reviewers that this book is very hard to read. To be honest, I almost wanted to return the book a week after I got it. I am very glad I didn't though, because it contains lots of useful info, even though I have read only 100 pages at the time of writing. It has helped me find a trading method that's suitable for my trading style and has improved my conviction in my trades. I only wish I had read 100 pages of this book before I start trading.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn technical analysis and indicators. It may take you a year to finish the book, but it will be worth it. Of the 3 essential Ms to trading (money mangement, mind, and method), this will help your method greatly. For mind, I recommend Douglas' Trading in the Zone."
2,Unreadable,"Luckily I borrowed this from a library. Look's like there's some interesting info when you skim through it, but the writing style is basically unreadable. Unless you're into pain, look for something better. Almost anything else on this subject would be more coherent. Nuff said."
1,"Severe review manipulation going on, but in the end, the book still sucks","This is truly a bizarre rating board, exposing the very worst flaws of Amazon's review system. On the one hand, we have obvious shills, whose generic 5-star reviews don't even come close to passing the smell test. On the other, there are tons of single-review bashers who can barely grasp the English language. The tells are that they are all short reviews and chronically misspell the same words: ""waist"" for ""waste,"" and ""starts"" for ""stars."" Very bizarre.For those who care, the truth is that the author is in fact a terrible writer and trader. (Read my other reviews, if you think I a paid basher -- I simply tell it like it is). The critiques of his writing style and lack of content are spot on. Move on. Look for a better trading book."
4,Good book,very good book. the best of them . I really expect to be able to apply everything that ive learned.
1,WHO IS THE MANIPULATOR??????,"From the beginning this board has been crawling with manipulating liars. Unfortunately, all they are able to utter has been the repetition of the fairy tale of ""emperor's new clothes.""It is my strong belief that this author is incapable of dealing with a simple arithmetic matter, or defining a rudimentary concept. Any honest reader would be able to see deception written all over the book.In summary, I do not believe that this book deserves even a single star."
1,"Terrible, awful writing!","I really can't believe that anyone would give this book 5 stars. The writing is absolutely awful. The one or two slightly valuable ideas in the book are not at all worth the investment of money, and especially of time. Take if from an experienced ""swing trader"", don't waste your money on this one."
1,"No substance, Very wordy","VERY difficult to understand, the charts in this book look like tangled spaghetti, the wording is long and makes little sense. I returned the book 5 days after i bought it. The techniques in this book are useless if you can understand them. I am not new to trading books and have read my share but this has to be one of the worst. Don`t waste your time or money on the book."
2,Write a book for a paragraph.,"The only technical writing in this book is the overwriting. My writing teacher would scream. I certainly did. Save the paper, overwriting makes the book very boring. I dont think anyone could have finished reading it. Should have written the book with a beginners and intermediate traders point of view. Lighten up and have some fun. In the world of trading, anything can happen. The book needs to show this. Dont repeat the same old stuff every other book has, in a high and mighty way. Dont waste my time or money. Instead give me ways to make money."
1,Master Confusion,I did not find this book valuable. Read all the reviews carefully. This book is confusion wraped up in a shiney cover. I'm very disapointed. You will need prozac after reading this one.Jerry
4,Second CD to keep every body dancing!!!,"Not so great like the first album, but if you listened J.Quest, you know that you wanted more and here it is!!! Very good!!!"
4,badass brazilian rock,"i'm an American living in Brazil right now, and this is one of two of the best bands in brazil (went to their concert here also). try it out, you won't be disappointed if you like rock."
5,Love and Death Hidden,"I have read this book and passed it on to my son to read, then bought another for myself. I could not believe how much truth is just swept under the rug, and someone as brave as Kevin, to bring out the truth, can be shunned by government and churches alike. This tells me you can't even have faith in all churches. Their day of reckoning is coming. Shame on Canada."
5,excellent,"From Snatches of Pink's MainMan Michael Rank comes a beauty of a disc in the vein of Nick Drake. Acoustic guitars, hushed vocals, strings, Sara Romweber's percussions. Tasty. Those of you familiar with SOP will be surprised. Give it the chance it deserves. It's awesome, but not like SOP."
4,Finnegan's Wake by Schooner Fare,"Vintage Schooner Fare; Brought back fond memories of sitting in Mul's Irish Pub in Portland, ME listening to friends with friends."
4,good songs performed well,a good selection of their earlier songs all performed with that Schooner Fare straight forwardness and beauty. most were not on other albums
3,"Good, but has flaws","Don't buy this if you're expecting quality discs, buy this if you would like your own portable basket.Cons:-The discs suck-The ""chains"" are essentially yarn/nylon shielded in plastic/resin beads. The ""chains"" are not built to last.-Heavier than it needs to be.Pros:-Portable. The base (quad pod) folds for easier transport.-Easy to assemble. If you think it's difficult then you never should have picked up a tool in the first place.-Aside from the ""chains"" the structure of the basket is sound.-If you don't mind making modifications, such as replacing the ""chains"" with real chains you can pick up for about $10 at a hardware store, this is a great basket for home use.I have made the modifications mentioned above, if you do the same, this 3/5 star product could be bumped up to 4/5.I got this as a gift from someone who is ignorant about disc golf, but I enjoy it all the same. I may not have specifically chosen it if I were to have bought it, but I am satisfied with it."
3,Modern PR,"Edward Bernays is most infamous as the founder of modern public relations as we know it today, and particularly for his advertising campaign to make cigarettes popular for women. Bernays taps into his uncle's understanding of the human unconscious and then exploits it, by turning us all into products. A disturbing an continually prescient text on the art of commercial manipulation."
2,Propaganda on Propaganda,I was a bit disappointed in this. It's a tract from the 1920's that is essentially an apologia for propaganda. I was hoping this would be a little more intriguing as to the how-to but this is mostly about things that we consider as basic PR these days. It was a bit repetitious and a chore to get through.
2,"Yup - it's Propaganda, all right.","This isn't entirely uninteresting, but reading it is something of a slog. It was written, largely, as a sales brochure for one of the early developers of public relations as a business tool. Without teaching the mechanics of public relations, it does go into some detail about the possible uses of a PR firm, strongly selling the benefits of having good PR.Public Relations has, since this was written, grown into a major industry. Those interested in the history of this industry are likely to be the readers who enjoy this book the most."
4,PROPAGANDA,"THE SCIENCE OF CONTROL FREAKISM, HOLD ONTO YOUR MONEY,YOUR MIND,YOUR FAITH. THE SCIENCE OF TEACHING YOU NOTHING WHILE STEALING YOUR CHILDRENS SOULS. I WEEP FOR THE FUTURE."
1,Caveat emptor,"I found this book--the Ig Publishing edition--to be so poorly proofread (if at all) and so full of typos as to be virtually unreadable.I will probably end up throwing my copy away, as I would be too embarrassed to try to resell it.No comment regarding content."
4,A timless classic more pertinent today than ever,"Though written in the 1920's, this slim volume by Sigmund Freud's nephew is a veritable ""how-to"" book regarding public relations, advertising, mass manipulation, and the use of these techniques for business and political purposes. Most interestingly, the book serves as a sort of propaganda for propaganda itself, aiming to convince the reader that the techniques that comprise it are the best way to maintain public order. Clever!"
5,Creator of the PR business,"This classic by Edward Bernays should be on every college reading list! It describes not only the techniques of molding public opinion, but gives solid examples of each from the historical record. You will no longer wonder how Hitler managed to rise to power so quickly in Germany, and these techniques are in the arsenal of any global power seeking to influence public opinion. What amazes me is that I now recognize much of what I read and see as propaganda, not news."
3,Good Enough,"This book trys very hard to use the techniques it espouses as the very reasons why ""propoganda"" should be used more. It sounded like the author was at a job interview and trying to convince me that I would be missing something important if I didn't develop an entire marketing division and hire him as director. I found it to be like reading Machiavelli's ""The Prince"" in that it all makes sense today; but, I have to realize that it was written long ago and Bernays was the first to tell us what we now know as obvious. This may be a good read for someone just being introduced to marketing."
4,very tasty,"I WAS NOT SURE TO BUY IT AT FIRST, I SAID TO MYSELF, WELL JUST TWO REVIEWS,MAYBE NOT GOOD ENOUGH, BUT I DECIDED TO TRY IT,I HAD THIS VALENTINE DAY PARTY WITH 30 PEOPLE TOTAL,AND THEY LOVED THE LASAGNA,AND I WAS HAPPY THAT IORDERED."
4,good but pricey,"Quick and tasty, but a bit expensive. I like it, but only as a treat when I'm feeling rich."
1,$25 Chefboyardee? I don't think so...,"Tasted exactly like the same crap I get served in the chow hall on a military base. It was truly poor quality, which is a surprise considering how awesome every other Omaha Steak product is. Don't waste your money!"
4,Beef Lasagna,"December 30, 2011I ordered this lasagna for my new years eve celebration, but I decided to prepare it earlier as sort of a pre new years celebration ... a starter. I was not sure what to expect, because when I opened the box it sort of looks like the frozen lasagna I seen in other venues. Well anway, I tossed it in the microwave on the vegetable setting for about 8 minutes and it was done. The cheese on top was real and stringy, all the ingredients were fresh and tasty esp. the ricotta. In my opinion this lasagna gets four stars for freshness, flavor and cheesiness. Love it!!Daphne Savoy"
1,avoid this cd,"This cd contains songs that are RE-RECORDINGS of Hot Chocolate hits, NOT the original hits themselves. Save yourself the bother of returning it and don't buy it at all. If you really want to relive some great 70s memories, do yourself a favour & fork over the few extra bucks for a cd with the original recordings on it."
1,Hilarante,"solo debo decir que esta cosa innombrable es una de las peores mierdas en el mundo de la pseudoliteratura (si es que llega a serlo), y eso de que este libro sólo lo entiende gente con criterio me desternilló, me alarma la falta de educación en México y en ciertas personas con ese tipo de pensamiento puritano y de doble moral, necesitada de ayuda para educar a sus hijos debido su nimia capacidad para hacerlo, los educan a la forma de este panoli, quitándoles a los pobres niños una infancia saludable y sublime, como de debe ser. Es triste saber también que la gente no conoce que hay un Rabelais y un Cervantes. En resumen, prefiero ser torturado por la inquisición a leer este libro del infierno."
5,Hell raising anthems!,"Very cool, hard core rythum guitar hooks. My favorites are ""Tortured"" and ""Where We Come From"". The singer's voice is the perfect counterpart to the wall of guitars too. All that I can say is that listening to this disc has me good and ready to go out and raise hell! These dudes are poised for world domination."
3,mixed feelings,"Through the Ice has a nice little plot, offers humor and some imaginative adventures typical of Anthony's writing, and has some good character interaction.The tone, however, was a big problem. I would expect Kornwise, being in his middle teens, to have the kind of ""gee whiz"" style that dominates the book. But Piers, in refashioning the text after Kornwise's death, somehow neglected to cut down on the vast numbers of exclamation points that litter virtually every page. They're jarring and not the mark of a mature writer.That said, the author's note at the end of the book details just how much effort Piers took to maintain Kornwise's voice while still producing a marketable novel, and he deserves vast respect for doing so. I just wish he'd gone a bit further in his changes."
3,"OK, but definately not in his top 10","I enjoyed the book but when it comes to Anthony, I've come to expect a lot more. While it was entertaining, it lacked that certain something that makes his stories reach out and grab you by your imagination. The characters never seemed to stand out from the crowd. They just seemed to drift along, never daring to be too bold. I was disapointed until the end when I discovered he didn't really wright it, but polished someone elses story."
5,This was an awesome book!!I read it 4 times!,"Piers Anthony and Robert Kornwise did a marvelous job on this book!!They wrote it so as to give the four adventurers challenge(that waswhen Vidav was taken out of the story temporaraly-which was certainlyneeded; with him there would be NO real danger to the ""Chosen"". Ialso really liked the ironic twist at the end of the book whenNefarious thought the Chosen were sent to help him.If you haven't read this book, you need to!Zylo 4"
1,pure garbage,this book is good for a child of 11 but expecting more i was rather disappointed. you can see easily when one author leaves off and the other comes in. i think the 15 year old author was better than piers anthony.
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"If one was prone to purchase Cliff Notes in college to avoid reading the whole book, then this book may have been written for you. It lacks detail and covers a purported 19-year history in 96 pages (which is more like 86). I am still reading the book, but am very disappointed in its overall content and depth. It appears to be slanted towards a one-sided view from the author's perspective and opinions. Parts are poorly written and several misspellings. If you are not of the Vietnam generation and want to get a full understanding of the Vietnam era, then I recommend that your money be spent on a more thoroughly written history. However, it is published on quality paper, and the photos and maps are of excellent quality."
4,"Released under a new title, new publisher.","From the Author:Transfer Of Wealth was about how various predatory policies have been based on gun control theories. Now released under the title Safe Streets In The Nationwide Concealed Carry Of Handguns (2008, Contrast Media Press), newer current affairs are shown to confirm this on an even wider scale, now affecting non-gun owners by the millions as well as 80 million gun owners.""I am real impressed with this book"" - Dr. Laura Schlessinger.Safe Streets In The Nationwide Concealed Carry Of Handguns - Meeting Dependency And Violent Crime With American Spirit, Independence And Citizen Authorityis available at Amazon.com"
2,Not very good,"Its too expensive....Not very good. It beeps the lights that are good. If you are patient the light bulb set inserter is very accurate,but you have to do it individually."
1,Price must be a typo,"I bought this at Ace Hardware for about $6. I've seen them even cheaper about $4. I gave up after hours of frustration trying to find bad bulbs/fuses. I'm going to Lowes or Home Depot tomorrow for ""Lightkeeper Pro"" cost around $25, but I've read great reviews."
4,Anything with Lenny Bruce on the cover can't be bad,"Great pop record, not quite as refined as later Auteurs releases, but a good record nevertheless.Highly recommended if you already own the other two full length CDs."
5,definitive Brit-pop plus,"Enter the world of Mr. Luke Haines and let the words & music do their thing, this realease back in '93 was largely ingnored and it is easily one of the finest rock n'roll recordings of the 90's. Sinister lyrics, wonderful instrumentation - a nice mix of punk, pop and glam ratchet this relaese up to magnifico. Be real happy you discovered this, his best release with this band and check out Black Box Recorder for a slightly different bent on Luke et al. Choice cuts on this; Early Years, Bailed Out, Showgirl and don't forget the killer hidden track after # 12.Brilliant."
3,An Attempt At Fairness,"""A Father's Rage"", by Don Davis is a good try at an even handed telling of an explosive true tale of child abuse, dysfunctional families, drug abuse, and explosive violence. While the defense paints the father's murder of the Binghams as justified vengeance, the prosecution calls it cold blooded murder, pure and simple, with some speed induced paranoia as an additional element. Pre-trial publicity is widespread and the controversy is heated. The author covers the events in a detailed and conscientious manner, and the trial is wonderful true-life drama. All in all, a very adequate telling of a true story of our time."
5,A Fun Read about an Exciting Festival,"Running with the Bulls is definitely a fun book and a must read for anyone going to Spain or the Festival of San Fermin. The author takes us on a grand tour of Spain and introduces us to the bullfight and the encierro--where he runs only inches ahead of the 6 killer bulls and 8 steers through Pamplona's narrow cobblestone streets.We can almost taste the rich Basque food and the sangria as the Festival takes place all around us. It's an easy read and there are 16 pages of color photos of the corrida, the run and the Festival. The book's epilogue is an informative guide that gives suggestions regarding how to run in the encierro."
1,A Bit Disappointing.....,"Running with the Bulls starts with an enticing prologue that seems to set a wonderfully exciting pace for the book. But it quickly cuts off into nothing more than the author's travel journal about how he spent his summer vacation in Spain.The cover photo is amazing, but unfortunately it's the only good photo in the book. The rest are nothing more than snapshots of the author and his friends with a couple of good shots of bullfights.The book does provide some good information about fiesta, the encierro & bullfights - but better information is probably available elsewhere."
3,Solid product,"This hotplate performs as expected and has been reliable for the past 4+ years. We use it several times a month during the fall and winter for table-top Japanese dishes. It has a 3-prong plug and a short cord, so it might not be compatible with all extension cords. The chrome hasn't rusted and it's easy to clean except for the area under the heating element, which is tricky to clean. The temperature control knob sometimes falls off, but it's easy to put back on. I was a little confused about the light at first, but I've gotten used to it. It has plenty of power for boiling large amounts of water."
4,convenient but power will be off,"I bought this product around 2 months ago. I'm almost happy with it for it's convenience. The reason we buy it is because we don't want to cook inside our house for lots of oil produced during cooking will mess up our house; Instead we cook in our garage. This stove meet our demands. The thing I'm not happy is during cooking, the power will be off. Actually before I buy it, I saw a review saying power won't stop and I was so excited about it, but actually it still shut off after I use it."
3,"This product is OK, but just ...",This product has gone up in price since I originally bought it in June of 2006.It has several design flaws but given the original price and the fact that it actually worked I was happy with the purchase.It is now May of 2007 and the thing no longer works.So I rate the product as OK and now consider it overpriced.
1,Save Your Money,"The price of this thing cannot be jusified. It looks nice. It even says ""Made In USA"". But it doesn't say where the heat control was made. That's the weak part. It is just a fancy on-off switch. It has a loose, imprecise feel. Mine began malfunctioning (heat on high with knob turned off) after about a year. A twelve dollar made in China unit would have done the same thing for less money."
1,junk,"New, improved, DIGITAL stove technology!!!! Off is off, lowest setting is non stop scorching full blast red hot. Impossible to cook with. Junk. This replaces my ten dollar target hot plate and the target plate was exactly the same way. Expected a lot more from 'professional' Broil King."
5,belongs in every public library,"This book ought to be in every public library, on the shelf right beside Edward Said's inadequate and biased Orientalism. If it is not in the public or university library that you use, ask the librarian to purchase a copy."
1,How to lobby,"Martin Kramer argues that US Middle East specialists have gone astray by misrepresenting the Middle East to their students and also to the US government. His book is aimed at Congress as acknowledged by the directors of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy which published the book; the Institute is a major lobby for Israel in the US. It is intended to discredit American Middle East specialists and, if possible, discontinue funding for teaching and training a new generation of such specialists in this country. That message is subdued in the book but explicitly stated in an op-ed Kramer wrote for the Wall Street Journal.For an extremely balanced review which notes where Kramer is correct but also his overstatements and highly selective representation of the opinions of some to whom he refers, see the review by F. Gregory Gause in the February/March 2002 issue of FOREIGN AFFAIRS. It's the best one I've read."
1,The Failure of Polemics,"This is a tendentious book that seems more oriented to settling accounts with academic competitors than really contributing to a debate. I am disappointed that a serious Washington think-tank would permit itself to publish such a volume without serious vetting. I could not help but concluding that the author's real agenda was undermining people who did not share his own hawkish views in the Arab-Israeli conflict. In short, less a book than a screed."
1,It seems Kramer also has his personal agenda,It seems Kramer also has his personal agenda. For a more balanced and better evaluation you should turn to Contending Visions of the Middle East : The History and Politics of Orientalism by Zachary Lockman.
2,Be Aware Russ Berrie Went Bankrupt and Star Registry Certificate No Longer an Option,"I bought my teddy bear at Christmas Mouse, on discount, this August 2011. Now I know why. If you go to wwww.shiningstars.com, you are informed that Russ Berrie, licensor of the Shining Stars line, has filed for bankrupcy on April 26, 2011. You are also informed that the Shining Stars website is no longer maintained. If you are buying the toy just because it's cute, great. If you want the star registry print out, you won't be getting it.Also, remember that the Star Registry is not really legitimate. Astronomers don't recognize the Star Registry. Hope this helps."
4,A child's view of the trauma of WWII torn Italy,"Italo Calvino is an artist in many different meanings of that word. But his first book, _The Path to the Nest of Spiders_, brings another view to the author. Told from the perspective of the child, Calvino is able to use his fantastic style, as well as his earthy analysis of the situations that arise. The Characters are both real and symbols, from the Sister who shares her bed each night, to the cook that is both an anarchist and a father to the boy. Calvino is truly a master at his craft, and this book shows where he came from, and how he is able to see the world and write about it"
2,"I,m still waiting for my adidas","Hello FriendsI am not very happy with you because of the order last December 30 did, this product ordered on 4 December and I have still not arrived, sent him again and I do not appear in orders so please need a Responding to this.Walfred Astudillo"
3,"Entertaining, but weakest of the series","Worth reading, but dramaticly weaker than the previous 3 in the series (which were delightful!).The last 1/4 of the book isn't even story, more like a set of authors notes created to help him map out the future world.There are several outright flubs, such as the hints about how they shouldn't have bragged about East Gate being impervious (which goes nowhere). Such as the last 20 pilots all ""crash"" landing at once, and they all die except Lambert who is unharmed? Like what happened with the Duke? Why the sudden ending with all the mongols in one place? The entire ""time is shifting"" angle seems to be thrown in to justify a few random changes in events (almost like the author wanted it both ways in one particular case), but goes nowhere. Weak."
3,Cute book,This is a cute book. I would have given it more stars if it would have had more content...it's really short. My daughter and I always wish there was more to it.
5,nice gift,i recieved this guitar as a gift from a friend for a favor i did them. at first i was skeptical as to the capability of this guitar. but i was quickly surprised. it has a great sound and very quick action. the ability to play out of an amp really makes this a very versitle little guitar. it is a bit small but that doesn't deter from it's ability. over all a great buy if you can get it.
5,Fine guitar for the price,"This guitar looks and sound fine for the price. I replace the stings for new and for casual playing It fits for me. It,s not a Martan or Epiphone which I owned both. The Quik turner which I bought for keeps me tuned. That is good enough for me THANKS"
1,No Good - Leaky cap after 4 months,"a) the unit is very awkward to fill - you have to turn it upside down with the handle on the bottom. Trust me - I'm strong - a wrestler, and it was a pain.b) the main water fill cap started leaking after 4 months. It's not a screw-type cap, so you can't tighten it to stop the leak. Instead it's a twist-lock cap which you can't tighten. Bad engineering.Bionaire then told me to buy a replacement cap for $10.00. No way"
2,Awkward Refillling / Poorly designed for cleaning,"I purchase the humidifier 2 years ago. It is quiet, humidifies effectively. I am looking for a new model due to following reasons: 1. Leaky water tank (refill on the bottom) 2. Considerable amount of water remains in the system even after tank is empty and machine shuts off. If not emptied soon -> build up of mold. Emptying would be very cumbersome. 3. Cleaning of the inner unit is practically impossible (with many cravisses and corners and requires screw driver). After short use you are stuck with a messy unit with mold interior (you won't know it is moldy unless you completely disassemble the unit).It would be no engineering feat to streamline the water channels and corners inside the machine and make it easier to fully clean."
2,"Stupid design, stopped working after a month","This humidifier has the worst design ever. You have to fill the tank from the BOTTOM. In order to do so, you have to take the tank, fill it in the tub, and flip the full tank(which is harder than you can imagine) and carry it back to the humidifier. Why not put a opening on top so that we can fill it easily? Therefore, definitely not recommended for the weak and the elderly.Second... Even if the tank is full of water, the 'no water' lights turns on and it stops working. I restart and it again stops a few minutes later. (It used to be fine when I first bought it)The only good thing is, yes, it is silent."
2,Don't recommend it: It leaks if you are not careful,"This humidifier is quiet in the low moist setting, a little noisier in the high moist setting. The problem that I found is that it leaks. You have to be very careful when closing the water tank after filling it because otherwise it will leak. I think the desing and quality are very poor.I refilled the water tank and let it running in my son's bedroom overnight, the next morning I discovered that the tank was empty: it had been leaking all night. It ruined my hardwood floors."
1,not a good buy,"i had two of these - the first i returned after 6 weeks because it started leaking (ruined my carpet) and foolishly i replaced it with another one the same, thinking that must have been a one-off. However, the second one had another problem. AFter only a month, the 'refill needed' light went on, and stayed on even though the tank was filled with water. That meant that the unit would not work, because it thought the water had run dry. I tried switching the 'refill' light off, but it repeatedly just switched itself back on again. So I gave up (by this time winter was almost over). I cannot recommend this model."
1,Don't get it,This humidifier does not last long. It only works 2-3 months. After that it starts leaking. The Restart is always sets to On even when I didn't need to. Don't waste your time with buying this one.
5,eleven delightful yarns,"This anthology lives up to its title as felines become involved in crime including solving and interfering as the cats risk their nine lives. The collection includes eleven delightful yarns from some of the genre's more powerful authors, but none of the contributors consistently feed the frenzy of cat lover sub-genre; in other words no Louie or Sneaky Pie, etc. making an appearance as a protagonist or author. Still the tales are well written and cover a wide spectrum of subclassifications so those fans of cat capers will loudly meow for KITTENS, CATS AND CRIME.Harriet Klausner"
2,English Isn't Crazy!: The Elements of Our Language and How to Teach Them,"The book wasn't for me. I feel it is targetted at people know more history and English than I. The various invasions that brought new words to English seem to overlap and dates seem to be all over the place. I just found it confusing. I couldn't finish it, and will leave it to those who a little more erudite."
2,Great episodes but DVD does not play in all devices!!!,"So, here's the deal. The content is great. It has 6 regular episodes and one double length episode not available on the other dvds. However, this dvd is not what you might expect. It says, ""This disc is expected to play back in DVD Video ""play-only"" devices and may not play in other DVD devices, including recorders and PC drives."" It says this in very tiny print. I popped it in my computer to play for my kids and the computer crashed and rebooted. Seriously. Twice. Also, interestingly enough, above the barcode it says, ""Manufactured by Amazon.com"" Anyway, just thought I'd share this information because it certainly isn't clearly explained in the product info. Guess this is what they mean when they say ""This product is manufactured on demand using DVD-R recordable media."""
1,It doesn't even play with Sony DVD players!,"What a disappointment! I've read about the warning of the devices before I purchased this DVD, however, it doesn't even play on TWO different Sony DVD players! Both of them are ""play-only"" devices and new models! It took a long time to ""load"" the dvd, and after the spinning stopped, no image, nothing happened! It is just not playable! If Amazon/CreateSpace has the technology to produce such a product and sale it in top price, why don't they produce something user-friendly? Instead, we paid almost $20 for ONE useless dvd, got super disappointed and have to go through the hassle of return/refund! What a waste of time!"
1,WHAT????? Bootleg from Amazon?,"I received this dvd-r in the mail and was extremely irritated. It was NOT clear on the web that this was basically a bootleg copy of the dvd, ""made to order"", supposedly ""authorized"" by Nickelodeon. That should be in huge red letters on the Amazon website. this really makes me question Amazon now, and I have been a frequent customer for many years. Maybe this made on demand dvd thing is the wave of the future, but until it is commonplace, they should make it really clear what they are sending you. I don't know if I'll be able to return it or not. But I am definitely irritated with Amazon and will think twice before placing another order. I thought it was ebay and the second-party Amazon sellers I had to look out for, but now I know better!"
5,Finally,"Thank you Red Jerry.He has the touch some of us have been waiting for, right? Like other ""chill"" djs have all been beating about the bush until now. Well, no compromises here. Seamlessly put together collections of trully deep electronica.I hope you read this, RJ, and it encourages you to make more of same...."
4,Wish it could be longer,Good DVD -some dated songs that I remember when I was a kid -and some from before I was born. My 7 month old son enjoys watching it. I wish that the DVD would be longer -too bad they didn't add a few more songs.
5,Great DVD!,I got this for my son when he was about 9months because he loves sesame street and he loves this DVD! We could watch it over and over again. The songs are are so much fun. Great purchase!If your child loves music and sesame street then go for it!
2,didnt like it,"After reading some rave reviews on this DVD decided to buy it,, but didnt like it at all. not worth buying."
2,Okay,"My 6month old enjoys only a few of the songs. Since he is usually watching dvds while in his jumparoo, he likes the more upbeat songs, some of the songs are a little low toned."
2,Disappointment!,"After watching best of elmo's world, I expected more out of this DVD video. Half of the videos are outdated, made in 70's. This DVD doesn't hold my 18 month old daughter's attention expect for the initial song Honker Duckie song. Don't waste your money. For $9 its not worth it."
2,Very Disappointed,"I'm really disappointed in this DVD. I'm surprised at all the rave reviews. I got it as part of a set for my son, and quite frankly I expected more. He ADORES Sesame Street and loves the songs, so I thought some musical ones would be perfect for him. This DVD does not hold his attention AT ALL. There aren't enough of the Sesame Street characters in it; it's mostly muppets and guest singers. It's also too short, barely a half an hour--if that. I wish I could return the whole set. I feel like I wasted my money. If you're looking for good Sesame Street DVD's try 1-2-3 Count With Me, Learning About Letters, The Alphabet Jungle, and the actual Sesame Street episodes on DVD."
1,BORING,I purchased this dvd thinking that it would be fun but actually is a boring old dvd. The colors are dull. My son didnt watch at least 5 mins of the dvd.
1,awful,I have several older sesame street VHS tapes that i was gifted when we had twins and I thought I would buy a few more DVD's to add to our collection. This is just a terrible mix of VERY old clips and none are good to sing along to let alone sing yourself silly. Don't waste your money.
1,Too Short,"I bought this DVD along with other Audio CDs from Amazon. I was hoping that it would contain songs from Sesame Street that would last for at least an hour. It was a total let down. They hardly have content that lasts 1/2 and hour. Disappointed about that, but the few songs in there are enjoyable."
5,Past and Present Fav!,"This disk used to be one of my favorite movies when I was a kid, so I bought it for my Niece for her 1st birthday. It was delivered quickly and in perfect condition!"
4,Delightfully silly,"This is my first and only Sesame Street video, and my 2-year-old and I both enjoy it. There are a couple of songs that just have drawings (instead of puppets/people) which my son doesn't like, but there are a few outstanding songs that are delightfully silly and/or feature people who were famous in the 70s, which is fun for me. For under $10 it's cute, but it's really just a random re-hashing of old S.S. clips. But I still recommend it."
5,Love my CD!,"I bought this for my grandson and really enjoyed watching it with him! It has great music and of course, the muppets are adorable. He is very musical so he really loves it!"
3,Cute,Not great but cute. My grandson loves the James Taylor sequence but that's about it. It is good for a quick break from regular activities during the day.
3,sing yourself silly,It's fine..just a little older than I realized..too many characters that my grand daughter didn't recognize. Still liked the music.
5,16 month old loves it,"My 16 month old daughter didn't like this video the first couple times we put it on for her. However, after playing it 3 or 4 times, she finally began to watch it and has grown to love it. She has to watch it at least once a day! It might be weird for younger parents because most of the celebrities are from the 80's and might not be recognized, but nonetheless it is a great video for kids. My favorite song on the DVD is ""Jellyman Kelley"" performed by James Taylor."
4,silly silly songs,It is just as the title says..sing yourself silly. As an adult I find it annoying but fun asit brings back memories. For a toddler it is fun. I gave it four stars because I thought it would be song after song and not an episode from the show itself.
5,beautiful and aggressive,"she has to be the most hardcore girl of all time,her lyrics are powerful and the music is heavy and hard.she has to be one of the hottest rock girls out there.there is no one out there in the music business like her,i also checked out her old songs in her rapping daze and damn she can rap like no other.But man she is absolutely one of the beautifulest rock girls out there i love her,the stuff she wears turns me on.but yea buy the album,buy all her albums:all is not well,relief through release,and both MYRUIN cds you wont regret it.Also check out Amiee echo's bands cause damn she hott too!!"
4,"What a journey, one few people WOULD take","I didn't go into DEAR MR. GACY with any expectations but I came out wow'ed by the sheer emotion of the movie.Based on a TRUE STORY, this movie takes you on a journey that few take. A young boy writing his college paper decides to write the serial killer John Wayne Gacy and see if he can get inside his mind. What transpires is shocking, horrific, and a journey you won't soon forget.William Forsythe plays Gacy and does a very good job of convincing you he IS John Wayne Gacy. I think the man should get some kind of acting award for his portrayal of the infamous serial killer.This movie is a MUST see if you are facinated with serial killers and true crime stories. It is very well written and the actors are very believable."
3,FORSYTHE IS THE MAN!,"I give this movie three stars,And the only reason i gave this film that was because of William Forsythe's brilliant performance as usual.The only reason i rented the movie on amazon was because he was the lead actor,I mean the man scared the hell out of me in this movie i put his performance up there with Anthony Hopkins performance in The Silence Of The Lambs,Rent or buy this movie just to see this awesome & terrifying betrail of one of americas most notorious serial killers John Wayne Gacy."
2,Very contrived in its message.,"Technically speaking, the book was alright. From the title, I anticipated a user's manual for the dedicated novice writer. To tap into thoughts and feelings. What I got was a contrived pseudo-passionate message which was a bit to condescending for my taste."
4,good quality,"put in printer had to run set up on cartridge,worked great after that. will buy more when I run out!"
5,a marvelous book,"""Diamonds are Forever"" is a marvelous book for anyone who loves baseball. I have lent it many times to my piano students and their parents, and they delight in the colorful paintings, witty drawings, artful photographs, deeply felt poems, and whimsical essays.I believe that baseball has something for everyone, on many levels from the most superficial ""three strikes and you're out"" to the statistical for those devoted to numbers, to the ""head""game"", the insiders' level that develops with thought and experience. By the time our three daughters played high school softball, they had learned the inside game quite well and found competitive joy in it.""Diamonds are Forever"" is a great coffee table book, but in addition to the wonderful visuals, it's a good read. Highly recommended!"
2,Not What I Expected,This book is boring. Plain and simple. I was hoping to find information to help me in my study of the language itself. What does a South Georgian speak differently than a person from Maine? We all speak English but it doesn't sound the same. It just wasn't the book for me.
5,Roxio Toast 8 Rocks!,"Bought this primarily for my TIVO set, so I could transfer and burn DVD's from my TIVO box. Once I hooked up my mac G5 to the TIVO box, Toast worked perfectly. Easy interface, fast transfer, easy to burn. It's nice to know that TIVO supports Mac. A great product!!!"
2,Bad choice if your serious about converting analog to digital,"I was most in need of software to convert vinyl to MP3. The software bundled with Toast 8 for burning vinyl is called Spin Doctor and will probably suffice for a lot of people. I have many 16 channel recordings that I wanted to get the best sound from them, and Spin Doctor falls very short. I purchased Sound Studio 3 and the difference is like a transistor radio verses stereo in my opinion. Toast 8 seems to be excellent for DVD and CD to MP3 and relitively easy to use. I bought Toast 8 based on reviews from their website, wrong place for review. For me Toast 8 was a waste of money."
3,happy with the product but caveat,"The software performs well, but if you are attracted by rebates, caveat emptor. I sent everything off correcetly, yet my rebate was denied as ""Missing Proof of Previous Ownership"" (of what it doesn't say). I bought the program, not an upgrade or update, so whyy on earth would I own it previously? I called and of course got a run-around. There is by the way a discussion of the rebate problems on Roxio's discussion boards, so apparently rebate denials are routine. See <http://forums.support.roxio.com/index.php?showtopic=19066&hl=rebate&st=0>."
1,Oversold Expectations,"Toast isn't the Mac equivalent of Roxio's Windows programs. All I wanted to do was burn copies of DVDs, and it constantly balks, hangs up, claims disks are damaged, etc. - - with discs that are NOT copy protected, run fine on either Windows computers, or DVD players.To add insult to injury, literally within hours of purchasing Toast 8, they released Toast 9 - - and the best offer they would make (NOT a free upgrade!) was a modest discount on 9."
2,Toast is Toast,"Works well, but I am tired of purchasing a new software package and then they come out with a new version a month later and you have to pay FULL price for the new one."
1,Slow and buggy makes me crazy,"I've had Toast for about a month now and all I can think about is the HOURS I've wasted trying to get it to work. This was supposed to make my life easy. I bought it so that I could transfer stuff from my TiVo to DVD and to my iPhone. So far I have been able to do the latter with moderate success... it takes a long time and the quality isn't particularly good. As for the former, I have tried various fixes and options, but it still takes over 2 hours to burn a 90 minute movie, and that's after the hour it takes to download it from TiVo. And I've burned 3 disks exactly the same, but only 1 of them actually worked.Now, of course, they are releasing version 9... so I'm doubly pissed since I just bought 8 last month. I hope the new version is better, faster and reliable. I'll keep an eye on reviews before I make the leap."
1,Don't buy this for TivoToGo,"I bought this product explicitly for the TivoToGo feature (didn't need any of the other features) and, simply put, it doesn't work. I have three TiVos all of which are supposedly supported - at least they work on the PC version when I run Parallels. I have followed every suggestion on the Roxio support site (rebooted tivos, my mac, installed upgrades, etc.) but none of it has made any difference.I recommend downloading the free ""TiVoDecode Manager"" software - its not perfect but it actually works."
1,Don't Buy,"Terrible. Refused to install on my brand new Mac. After multiple tries, I was going to call for tech support but they want $2 a minute to tell me they produced a horrible product. I have a better idea - how about I keep the $25 it would cost me to call you, and you can have your crummy software back."
3,Warning to those who need closed captioning,"Toast 8 works pretty well and is fairly intuitive. (The documentation leaves something to be desired, but that seems to be the norm for software.) I bought Toast primarily to be able to copy Tivo files to DVD. It does that well enough. BUT I am hard of hearing and rely on closed captioning. Programs moved from Tivo to a Mac and played back with the Toast video player (included with the software) do have closed captions. But if you burn a Tivo program to DVD, you will lose all captions. There are a few threads on Roxio's user boards discussing this problem -- didn't even occur to me that it might be an issue before I made my purchase. Supposedly the issue has to do with the process of encoding DVDs and may not be something Roxio can fix. Just a warning to those who (like me) can't use video without captions..."
2,Even Small updates are Difficult and Time Consuming,"Unlike many other companies, when you want to update toast you are faced with a time consuming process.You must register the product (with your email address). Create an account. Log into that account. Download your update. Reinstall the software (on my most recent update I had to re-enter the CD license key)!What a hassle!If not for the difficult updating procedure this software could be rated 4 or 5 stars."
4,Toast 8,"I bought this so I could convert and access my TiVo shows on my Apple. The one issue I have with the TiVo Transfer application is that I can't stream shows from my TiVo DVR. I have to transfer them to my hard drive first. Some of my programs are 5 gig and the process takes about 4 hours on my wireless network. Over all, though, it integrates nicely. I was able to tranfer a program of Family Guy, convert it to mpg4 and then load it onto my iPod. Pretty fun!"
3,Well done,"As a Mac user, I've been using Toast for a long time. When I saw version 8 at a good price I snapped it up. As usual, it does not disappoint. It is a reliable, quality product and it performs all tasks flawlessly. My only suggestion for someone considering it is: if you just want to back up or burn CDs, you don't need Toast, but if you want to do more, such as archiving and converting vinyl recordings, Toast is a solid product that will help you do these things easily."
4,Toast 8,Roxio Toast 8 Titanium (Mac) [OLD EDITION]Finally found a good product for my MAC Intel. I used Roxio Creator 8 on my late PC and this program for the MAC preformed just as good if not better. A good choice for MAC users.
1,Toast 8,"It really sucks!!! It's very easy to use but on the other hand, the quality of the imagine is very very poor. Sometimes the imagine is so full of pixels that it's impossible to continue using. I thought that I wasn't using it properly but it turned out that it's the software that's not good."
1,Sucks!,"I have to be honest. If you do very little, this package will do very little along with you. I REALLY wish Nero existed for the Mac. Roxio's poorly stable programs, lack of features, and non-existent customer support makes for a pretty ill customer base. Ahh, but they probably don't care about that, they just want your money. So, if you'd like to donate $65 to the Roxio bank account fund-raiser, please click, ""Add to cart"". Just don't forget you still need to buy CD/DVD burning software afterwards, mk?"
3,ok but not great...,I have been using toast 7 and was hoping toast 8 would offer more for the upgrade price than it does....The divx encoder is still not the latest version that support multi-core processors - major bummerIf your a new user then toast is by all means worth it... but if your an upgrader welllllll toast 7 is just fine..... this should have been a 15 dollar upgrade because its just not that much more powerful.... sorry Roxio but these high upgrade charges should mean more product.
1,hardware error and sense key error,"new lacie 18x DVD writer with DL firewiremacbook pro 2.16 dual intel, 3gb ram, 10.4.11media - fujifilm DVD-R, 4.7gb, 16xonly gives errors when burning at speeds above 8x (and ""best"" speed setting). Whats the point of setup if you can only burn at 8x?PLEASE FIX THIS SOFTWARE!-l"
2,Don't buy this,No support.Lousy manual.I cannot do with this product what I wanted to do because no one will answer my e-mail to help me. It is not user friendly.I made a mistake thinking this would work for me. I am a spinning instructor and purchased it to put together my spinning music. I wanted to use the fade in and fade out feature and cannot figure out how to do it. I have googled to see if there is any help out there and have not had any luck. I followed the limited instructions provided and it is a no go.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT based on a WORTHLESS REBATE,"I am an intelligent adult and have successfully mailed in and received hundreds of product rebates over the years, but there is no guarantee you will receive a Roxio rebate if you purchase this product! The company that processes their rebates are fraudulent and do everything they can to get away with it. I call them every month!Unfortunately, I was originally not going to buy this program, but decided to anyway when a great price was offered in combination with the $30 rebate. Without the rebate, for me it was a total rip off. If this product seems worth the price to you, regardless of the rebate probably not going through, please ignore my negative review.I can't stress this enough... Do NOT count on receiving the rebate for Roxio Toast!"
3,Not for my system,"When I ordered this, the ad said that it was for Mac OS 10. They neglected to say that it was for OS 10.4 only, and I have OS 10.3.9 so I'm stuck with a program that I can't use. Be careful when ordering upgrades!"
3,Good but... little bit disappointed,"I was anxiously waiting for this Roxio Toast 8 for my new mac book, and I got it as fast as I can after its release.I am pretty much satisfied with its quality and functions.It's faster than the old and has many good and new features.However, I was disappointed little bit that I could rip my DVDs for my iPod.I tried serveral DVDs that I own for iPod, but it didn't work.Really disappointed...So, I downloaded Handbrake which is free software on internet. it worked great for me.Overall, Toast 8 is good and works for me!"
5,Roxio Toast 8 Titanium,I am very excited about the additions to Toast 8. I am still learning how to use all of them. The connection with TiVo is one of the most exciting new items. I have connected and reviewed Tivo recordings through Toast. I have not had an opportunity to use toast for a DVD yet.
1,Hard to rate it when it won't even open!,"Beware Mac users who are not using OS X 10.4.8 or higher! It may say all you need is OS X, but I bought my computer shortly before the release of Tiger, so I am running OS X 10.3.9 and Toast will not even open! So now I guess I'm looking at paying another $130 to upgrade my OS. Hope I won't be throwing good money after bad, as they say!"
3,"Gorgeous, but...","Gorgeous boots, extremely well made, but unfortunately, the straps are way, way too short to go around my calf, as I have muscular dancer's calves. The display picture is pretty accurate- Unless your calves are very slender, these boots will not fit you."
1,A Waste Of Time!,"I strongly recommend that you don't waste your time and money on Balance Of Power. I have been a big fan of R.N. Patterson's previous books. However, the plot in his latest work is much too drawn out, the plot is weak and the character development is very shallow. ..."
3,Missed the mark,"Good writing, interesting concept, but a political passion play and an over-the-top melodrama. Familiar friends and characters return to this RNP production, however the author's political agenda is glaringly clear. There are better arguements around for proper gun control and I think ultimately this is what makes Balance of Power a sappy read."
1,poor research,"I found that with in the first 5 tapes that its not going to get better. It is very annoying to be preached at from a guy who seems to never used a gun or possibly held one. examples.A hand gun with a 40rd mag, you'll have a hard time finding one of those. at first I wasn't sure if it was a mislabled hand gun or a rifle, but then it fit in a toy box. the lack of mentioning of multiple safeties on most hand guns was disappointing.I have notices that most gun manufacturers don't make their own ammo, and the cop killer bullets, as far as I know, are designed differently.He just barely touched on people using other weapons if guns weren't available. (kinda joked about it)he did make a few good points on why the wrong people have the weapons now. but I am not going to take his word on the matter.the staticis he kept refering to seemed inflated, I wondered if the 80 or so a day included soldiers.I think I will return it to the libary unfinished"
3,Reader Ruins Book,I listened to the audio version of this book. The readercame close to making an interesting book painfully boring.Surely there was someone available who could have read withmore expression and given the male characters more definition
2,"Frustration with a Capital ""F""","AAAHHHHHH!!!! I never thought I'd get to the end of this one. Usually a Richard North Patterson fan, I was surprised (not pleasantly) that this book resembled the Energizer Bunny in that it ""kept going and going and going"". While the storyline was great and the characters were likable, I found myself saying, ""just vote on the legislation and put us out of our misery"". I MADE myself finish this book because I kept thinking the end would justify the means, unfortunately when I turned the last page I just cheered out of simple and utter relief."
1,I agree with his views but couldn't make it through the book,"This was an all-time snoozer. I listened to the first 3 cds of 5 on a long car trip and it's a wonder I didn't pass out and crash. Cardboard characters, convoluted (and silly) plot-even the abridged audiobook was too much."
1,Too biased,This is only the second book I have started and not been able to finish. Patterson is so busy preaching his gospel the story is not interesting.
2,Falters then falls flat,"I've been a Richard North Patterson fan for years, so I was sickeningly disappointed with ""Balance of Power"". Overall it was a good story idea presented weakly and very unrealistically. I expected much more of a plot, better development and more interesting characters - and was disappointed on all points. The writing sounded forced, the dialogue like a bad movie and the action predictable and telegraphed way ahead. There were no surprises, and the ending felt like Patterson just ran out of enthusiasm for his own story."
1,Boring political propaganda,"I will never buy another book by this author.I didn't even finish this one after realizing that it was just a tedious recital of the author's ideological views with a thin veneer of fiction. Whether or not one agrees with his views, it was deceptive to promote this book as an entertaining mystery story. I feel ripped off."
1,Jumped the shark,"There are two brothers. Both enter politics. One is assassinated; the second is shot and wounded then become President. He marries and on his wedding day his new wife's mother, sister and niece are all murdered by gun violence. The pact with the reader is shattered, and Patterson jumps the shark. So the remained of this strange book is a joke. Too weird to review, much less publish."
2,disappointing,"Having read and appreciated all of Richard North Patterson's previous books, I eagerly awaited this one. I found it dull, opinionated and preachy. It was too filled with legal technicalities for me to completely understand all the anti-gun testimony and deposition proceedings. All-in-all, had I read more about it instead of preordering it before release date, I would not have bought it. I did, however, finish it, but the ending was a foregone conclusion."
3,Distorted and one sided agenda thrill ride,"I have revised my previous review, it is rare for a book I didn't like to ever be read again. This one I had to re-read. Was I really that irritated by the preaching, lack of intelligent research on the issue, chosing to present only one side while claiming to be balanced (Could say the same for Fox News as well at times)and the Chester Gould ""Dick Tracy"" descriptions of of everyone who did not agree with Patterson's views? The answer is: yes.Was I caught up in the plot's pacing, did I keep turning page after page caught in the political intrigue, was I at some points siding with the main character and at other points hoping he would fail miserably. This is the result of good storytelling. As I said in another review I could do without 100 pages or so of preaching. I have upgraded from a one star to a three star vote..Buy used"
4,"Preachy at times, but engaging","There is no doubt whatsoever on what side of the ""gun debate"" Mr. Patterson is. But, on the other hand, he's the author and he can weave and spin his story however he wants - it doesn't hurt that I happen to agree with him. Despite the fact that at times, I felt like I was getting a civics lesson while listening to this book, I felt the characters were interesting (and if you're a fan of Patterson, you're already a fan of Kerry Kilcannon) and the story engaging enough to keep me listening through 18 (or was it 16?) CDs."
1,Balance of Power completely unbalanced,"I have never read such political tripe disguised as fiction in my life! Every conservative in this book is depicted at best as spineless and at worst as inherently evil and selfish. I don't read fiction to gain political knowledge and I resent RNP's attempt to preach to me and other unsuspecting readers.Of course if I had bought the book off the shelf instead of on Amazon, I would have caught the reviews by Clinton and Ted KEnnedy. That alone would have made me put it back!"
1,Hats off...,"to anyone that finished this. I have read bad books before but and I have read long books before, but I never read anything this bad and this long both. I quit at the start of one of first-lady-testifies scenes not after the first time the victims were all listed in the scene but the second time.The writer has no feel for my interest at all. He doesn't trust my ability to add details to a light sketch of a scene. Instead he writes as if he were communicating with a set designer.Please stop buying books like this. It encourages publishers to support keyboardists like Patterson."
1,Too long and detailed,I tried to listen to the tapes but it was too long. Lara's family is killed early on and the whole rest of the tapes (10?) seems to be about changing existing law.
1,A Waste of Time!,"I strongly recommend that you don't waste your time and money on Balance Of Power. I have been a fan of R.N. Patterson's previous books. However, the plot in his latest work is much too drawn out and weak and the character development is very shallow."
4,"Large, color reproductions with analysis; brief biography","Full page, color illustrations of Paul Gaugin's work appear with the author's interpretation and some background information about each work of art on the facing page. I appreciate the large, color reproductions. There is very brief biographical information at the beginning of the book. I don't feel the biographical information was quite enough, even for my 6 year old, so we will supplement with another children's biography on Gaugin. This was a great first book to read about Paul Gaugin. However, this book is not to be missed. What makes it special is the large format of the pictures and the in-depth analysis of each work, which seldom appears in children's books about an authors' work.It is a shame that this book is out of print!"
4,Not Meant To Be Shipped,"Packaging, packaging, packaging... This product was meant to be picked up at your local WalMart or Target... Carried to your car and tenderly moved to your home... Although the outer box was wonderfully packed with plastic air balloons, the product box designer has no idea on how to keep a product safe during shipping... The product arrived and works... However, both dials had fallen off and had to be searched for in the box... The product is cool... However, this was NOT meant to be shipped..."
4,Works Great!,I received the item in a timely manner. I am very pleased with the Double Burner Range. It heats up immediately and it works great! Its just the perfect size for our tiny kitchen in the cabin.
5,BroilKing PR-D1 Range,This is the second Broilking that I have owned and I have never had a problem with any of them. A real plus is the fact that the product is made in America still.BrMore than pleased
2,Full of grammatical mistakes and typos,I like the content but I cannot believe the mistakes I find in this book. It is distracting. It looks like this book has never been edited.
1,Not Suitable for Kindle,This book is a wonderful resource but it is not suitable for the Kindle format. It contains many tables that are rendered on screen in a point size to small to be legible. I highly recommend the print format.
5,A Keeper,This has great information on what to focus on during your asana practice. Will improve your knowledge of anatomy and provide an energetic jumpstart to your practice if you use it right.
5,Excellent book,This book has a very good way of describing marma therapy!It`s very easy to understand and it is very inspiring.A great book if you are allready working with ayurvedic massage !
3,Smaller than Advertised,"The printing is of good quality (about what I expected 4/5 stars), but the size is slightly smaller than the advertised 11x17 due to the tremendous amount of white space between the art and the edge of the poster. I ended up trimming the white ""frame"" because it looked awful with it. Actual size came out to be something like 9x15 (2/5 stars).a 3/5 stars average. I don't think I would buy another poster from this vendor again though."
4,I enjoyed using this product. It has a ...,"I enjoyed using this product. It has a pleasant fragrance and comes in a well-designed bottle. Compared to similar products (anti-bacterial, fruit fragrance), it's a reasonable price."
1,juicy mellon!,"This little bottle of soap has been sitting by my bathroom sink for a month now trying to tell me that it was actually mammaries, but it's not! It's soap! And here all this thime i've been washign my hands i've been taken in by softsoap's sumbiminal product label design. Bad Softsoap, Bad!"
4,Moderately useful kit...,"The UV filter makes a subtle difference except on humid days, where it really helps filter out haze.The polarizing filter is better replaced with a circular polarizing filter for easier adjustment.I have limited use for the Fluorescent filter, but it helps mute that alien green tint from normal tubes.I'd recommend just getting a UV filter and leaving it on as a protector, then getting the circ pol lense when needed rather than this kit."
5,Great Empowering Message Contained Within This Little Book!,"I love this cute little book! Its message is both powerful and timeless! It's a very short book. It took me about 10 minutes to read, however don't judge this book by it's size (no pun intended); its subtle message is really empowering! On this book you can say LESS IS MORE! Read it and get motivated today!Zev Saftlas, Author of Motivation That Works"
2,Omissions and errors decrease the value of this book,"This book is badly edited, sloppily written, and unreliable. Major characters from The Original Series and the movies (Saavik, for instance) are left out while even the most minor character from The Next Generation receives full coverage. It's also too dated to be of much use to the Deep Space Nine or Voyager fan.I don't recommend this book."
3,"Okay, not as great as the green eyed bandit usually puts out","Erick Sermon is probably my favorite Producer/Rapper combinated artist but this was really nuthin special...I became a fan after hearing his ""duet"" with Marvin Gaye, music and then I bought the album and became a certified fan.Ratings of the E-dub albums I own:Music: 4.5/5Double or nuthin: 4.5/5Erick Onassis: 3.5/5Chilltown New york: 4/5React: 3.5/5So as you can see, if you're planning to get an erick sermon album get those I rated higher before getting this...Sure there is about 6 definite bangers and 4 more okay and only one bad one... a couple of tracks is trying to be commercial tracks..."
4,Slendid,"""Double or Nothin"" was on point. He hasn't done an albulm that good since. I will say that ""React"" is the best since. This album has quite a few hits, Its classic Erick Sermon. The Funklord in my opinion has returned. Out of the 12 music tracks on this album, 6 are true head bangers. Thats 50% of the album. In my opinion with todays albums not even having 3 good hits on them, I think that's excellent. If u lookin for that ghetto funk by Erick Sermon, this album is a must. Everybody mentions the commercial cut ""REACT"" with Redman, but that's not the best cut on there. Track 14 is the track that'll have your head bobbin off your neck. After that, track 12 with MC Lyte and Rah Digga is a head bobber in itself with vintage MC Lyte flowin like she always do and Rah Digga doin her thang on it. He didn't slip on Track 11 either with Keith Murray and Redman."
1,Haven't I heard this before?,"I expected a lot better from E double. From one of the better hip-hop producers of all time, this album was wayyyyy below average.Maybe its my fault...Whenever a new Eric B & Rakim, Nas, Roots or Redman album came out, I always graded those albums with a different scale that I judged the Afro-Man album. Feel me?There is nothing on this album that you would remember ten minutes later. Nothing.I'll take into consideration the fact that I'm changing as a hip hop fan (Hell, no album could ever touch Illmatic). But this album isn't even close to average!Maybe I'm a little harsh, but that's my take on it. I'll never spend money on Erick Sermon again."
2,Not nearly as great as the MUSIC Album.,"The only really good song on this album is React. I was unimpressed with the overall quality of this album because it really lacked to illustrate the talent that I believe Erick Sermon has. One thing I will mention about his album which I think is pretty low is the lyrics in the second song titled ""Here I Iz."" Erick Sermon makes reference to ""dropping bombs over Baghdad."" I am not certain if he is just trying to make some political point or he was just being careless with words he used. In any event, I thing it is in really poor taste, I think he should really take a good look at his political philosophies before expounding them on his albums."
3,Not what I expected,"The writing is generally good. However I had several problems with the book. First of all the book is a piece of anti-federal government propaganda, repeated over and over again. Second, there are too many speeches by Charlie Flagg. This to me is sign of weak writing, the author shouldn't have to insert speeches in the protagonist's mouth for us to know what he is thinking. Third, I have a different take on Charlie. His selfishness caused his hired hand to lose his home and caused his son to go under. I don't view this as heroic."
5,No one today writes better or writes better stories.,"Beyond the quality of Kelton's stories, especially this one, is the quality of his characters. His leading character, an individualistic, independent, honest and brave rancher, is one of the most admirable people I have ever read about. This was the first Kelton book I read, and I became a Kelton addict. I have read and re-read this, and highly recommend it. Excellent!"
5,The Time It Never Rained,"I have read Elmer Kelton for years. He is outstanding fully developing the characters and the geographic setting, especially for those that do not know the country of which he writes. Though he is quite prolific, I have never read a bad Kelton story....and some have carried me through much if not all of the night."
3,Only 40 pages,"Anyone doing any research in PLL's should read the 40 page tutorial available in this book; but the papers assembeled and inserted do not make this book worth 172 dollars, especially since all of the articles are at least 6 years old.... I am a student, I can not afford two hundred dollars for every book that I find usefull......"
1,Don't waste your money!,"I had a batch of salsa to make at the last minute and thought this might be handy to buy and do the chopping for me. But after assembling it and re-reading the directions 50 times, it became clear that it didn't work. Not only did I waste an hour trying to get the darn thing to work, I ended up having to do all the chopping myself.It won't work unless the lid latch is locked and in place, but my latch wouldn't budge. Therefore, because of the safety features in place, the blades wouldn't move at all.Waste of money, time, and effort. Spend a few more dollars and get a different brand! I won't buy Black and Decker again."
1,Difficult to use,"This chopper is so small that it's hard to pour things into it. The lid is very hard to take on and off, and you'll have to take it on and off a lot b/c you won't be able to chop all your food at one time. I'll be buying a new one soon."
1,It's broken.,When my chopper arrived it was broken. I need to know how I can return it for a brand new one.
2,"Handy Little Item, but Not Durable","Admittedly, when I got this item, I used it every day. I chopped nuts, onion, garlic, carrots, etc. Its great for making a little pesto, dressing, etc. But after six months part of the bowl cracked off, then another part, and now the blades are dull and it jams more than it chops. All in all the item lasted about a year with no problems, and its limped along for another six months. Its not very expensive, so it wasn't a terrible investment-- still, I thought the Black and Decker name would mean it was more durable."
1,Blue Green Algae,This was a waste of money. I have bought Algae before and it really helped me with my appetite. This did nothing. Sorry
5,Divinely Human,"Erin McGraw doesn't make things easy for her readers -- but as we watch a tormented priest stuff his face at the refrigerator, as we feel our own overwhelming hunger for food and compassion and mercy, as we waltz with two men (the one we love and the one we married), as we lose our beards and endure ridicule, as we discover our husbands have betrayed us for decades, as we scatter the ashes of the woman who has been our rival, Erin McGraw makes us feel the giddy wonder of it all with a quiver of humor and deep waves of sorrow. I am in awe of her patient attention to each heart-breaking, tender detail, and I am inspired by the grace she finds in the lives of her suffering, divinely human people."
2,"Looks great online, so-so surface, then it cracked","I thought I was purchasing a very solid and very durable high-quality bamboo go board. It is sturdy and seemed well-built at first. I was a bit annoyed that the grid was not burnt into the board and is instead drawn on. For the price it should be. I have had this board for only 2 months and it has already developed *several* cracks between bamboo slats. There must be some issue with the glue used. There is nothing fantastic about my climate that would cause warping, especially with bamboo. I have a half-dozen bamboo cutting boards and have never had issues. I haven't contacted the seller about the quality issues. I'll update this review when I do with their response."
4,Strange find,"I am not sure how I picked up this CD, or what possessed me to purchase it 15 years ago, however I am glad I did. Some nice bubblegum shoegazer stuff here. Love the tracks Snowblind and Oreo dust."
3,GREAT ACTING BUT AVERAGE STORY LINE,"A former circus clown who was spared the gas chamber so that he might entertain thousands of other Jews as they marched to their deaths. He also to save his own life has to act like a dog bark and crawl around in a camp officals office to entertain him.Adam is now at an asylum populated solely by Holocaust survivors extremely popular with inmates and one nurse especially. Adam IQ makes him more brilliant than the doctors and more insane than any of the patients.I read and watch many stories on the death camps. But this story has something missing. It's an average dvd only. But don't get me wrong Jess Goldblum and William Dafoe did brilliant acting rolls. Maybe it was the changing from a book to a movie that ruined it I just don't know. I have given 5 stars to other death camp stories so don't think I was turned off by the theme, there is just something missing in the storyline."
3,Ruined by Surrealism,"Takes what could have been a very gruesome and serious theme and converts it into a surreal black comedy, complete with special effects and flashbacks. Only mildly enjoyable/interesting overall."
1,A one star !,I love the acting of Jeff Golblum. The story was predictable and boring. It was not one of his better movies.
1,Terrible Movie,From the beginning this movie had disgusting filth in it. I couldn't watch it and threw the movie away. I used to think Jeff Goldblum a good actor but am disappointed he would make such a movie.
5,used by an electrical engineer,"Price was great!I do not put to heavy use, so perfect for checking photometrics at job sites.I do not believe you can get calibrated, but good enough to do field investiagations at night for outdoor lighting.Used also for check light levels in parking garages.I have now owned this for several years"
3,"I like it, but my son - not so much","I think my 4-year old is a little spooked. The quality is OK, it moves (not too fast, but OK), the sparkles work just fine in the front, but the eyes did not light up. Overall it's okay. I'll hang on to it. A lot of times, kids warm up to a thing after a while (I KNOW its not a toy, but we have smaller Ima Robot and Z-Bot that my son absolutely loves). I say, go for it if you're a robot lover. It's a cool looking retro-bot that most of adults react with an ""ooo and aaa."""
4,Cute Vintage Style Robot,My son loves robots... so we bought him this one for his 5th birthday. He loves it!!! We taught him how to play with it properly so it doesn't break. He's had it for over a month now and it still works. Very neat collectible toy! We'll be getting him another one for Christmas.
1,Broke after 2nd windup and box says it is not a toy!,Really really junk. The box says it is not for children but adult collectors. It broke after the 2nd windup. Real junk.Schylling High Wheel Robot
5,Fascinating,"This books sets out to answer the question 'why do secular Israelis fear/dislike ultra-orthodox Jews so very much?'. I thought I knew a fair amount about this issue, and wasn't all that interested in learning more, but the book really surprised me -- it made me laugh and think, and I found myself citing it to many others.The story is extremely well-told and compelling. Efron makes it easy to empathise with every side by illustrating each issue with personal anecdotes from his own life between the seams, as a yarmulke-wearing Jew living in a secular neighbourhood of Tel Aviv, teaching in a religious Jewish University but with a profoundly critical and feminist world view.Buy this book if you know only a little about the issue, but especially if you think you already know all the answers!"
5,"Fascinating, unnerving, heartbreaking and moving","This is an astonishing book. Reading it is something like watching a train wreck in slow motion: frightful but at the same time so compelling that you cannot turn away. Efron manages to describe the fears and antagonisms between secular and religous Jews with great sympathy for both sides. He writes with such elegance that the book is a joy to read, even if it is ultimately upsetting. If you read one book about Israel, or about Jews for that matter, this should be it."
5,Distilled passion,"Now that the dust has settled on the socio-musical phenomenon that was ""grunge"", the true innovators of rock music from the early '90s can finally claim their place. Idaho's debut album was a tour de force of concise songwriting, inspired vocal performance and ear-tingling guitar noise. Jeff Martin's vocals ranged from narcoleptic drones to impassioned howls, supported by a wall of overdriven guitar fuzz and feedback that has long since served as a blueprint for a multitude of welterweight rock pretenders. The album contains a generous amount of nihilism that borders on depression, and this alone will alienate many listeners. However, those that have the desire to venture beyond Idaho's gloomy facade will find a wealth of invigorating sonic delights."
2,A droning drain,"2 1/2Moody and unmoving four chord distortion ditties which often go nowhere with uneccesary progressions, vocal indulgences, and an overall despondent aesthetic which works against intent, shrinking some decent but already severely limited songs into a bitter blur."
5,Great DVD on Paul Weller History,I thoroughly enjoyed this item. I bought a DVD player that can play the PAL/Region O. It was really inexpensive and worth every penny. This is a fantastic DVD on the Paul Weller Style Council history. A must have for Weller fans.
4,A mystery with a mission!,"The real theme of this book is animal abuse and torture during research. The mystery involves a scientist who gets treated like he treated the dogs in his lab. Now, who could have dunnit?You'll be rooting for the dogs in this one. The book is an easy read, with a serious message. I enjoyed it!"
1,"Ebook is useless without ""first tone"" mark",I wasn't too happy when I noticed that all of the text (though the pictures have it) did not include tone marks for the first (high pitch) tone...rendering the book useless to any learner. To the editor: Please fix and resend or give us back our money! (Same problem as with the Basic Cantonese book.)
5,You get what you pay for-but beware of limitations,"I bought the Toastmaster Eclipse burner and replaced it every year since something always went wrong.This burner is a marvel. The heat control is incredibly precise, from just keeping something tepid or warm to full-blown raging heat.Do not hesitate.===========Update on April 22:I am now far less enthusiastic:1. The cast iron top is NOT (reapeat NOT) easy to clean. It is so abrasive it will eat up sponges, paper towels and every thing else.2. The cast iron top stains very easily...with no hope of reducing the stain.3. Do not expect to change temperatures cooking on this top. The cast iron retains heat for a VERY long time. Trying to move from one temperature to another takes very many minutes...from high to low as much as 45 minutes."
3,not for canning,I bought this countertop range to use as an extra heat source for canning. It is beautifully made and might fry eggs very well. It will not bring a canner of water to a boil.
2,hotplate not very hot...,"I purchased this hotplate especially for canning, but it didn't work out. I cannot get my canner hot enough to build up the pressure necessary to can salmon. I've kept it because it works fine as an extra hot plate for buffets, but I probably should have returned it because this was too much to pay for something to just keep food warm...it would work just fine, I think, for everyday type cooking..."
3,A good debut,"I read this book after I read ""A Fine Balance"", and it goes to show (happily) that Mistry's writing style has developed and become much more interesting. Journey is the story of one man, Gustad Noble, facing a set of challenges in Bombay in 1971 (the year of the war with Pakistan.) Mistry also tells several different stories as the characters weave in and out of Gustad's life. Some of it works, some of it doesn't. You can predict some of the fates of the characters right from the beginning. But Mistry has written a solid book, and shows the promise that he fulfilled quite nicely in a Fine Balance."
4,Such a Beautiful Read,"Mistry is a modern author whose writing compares to author's of ""the Great Books"". Such a Long Journey gives a stunning idea of life during Indira Gandhi's reign. Besides the cultural lesson on India you receive from reading this book, you also come away with the struggles of loyalty a man faces with friendship and family. This book is not as engaging as A Fine Balance, but a wonderful read nonetheless."
3,Such a long journey to the end of this book!!!,"After reading and enjoying Mistry's A Fine Balance , I decided to read this earlier work. I expected the same quality of character development and seamless transitions from character to character as A Fine Balance. Instead, I found this book to be less cohesive. The book drifted from one undeveloped character to another, through the eyes of Gustad Noble, the main character. There were a lot of scenes that were set up to be significant but were never completely followed through. I felt sort of cheated once I reached the end of the book, because my high expectations were never met."
2,another boring book,This journey was too long for me.Managed to get half way through it and decided to put it up for sale.no takers-I wonder why :)
3,"Three Deaths And No Wedding, But There Was A Doll !!!","It was a long journey, and I was tired at the end... However, I must say that the book is quite moving, and I was saddened by [one of] the [three] death[s] at the end. There were some funny, but quite moving characters in it."
2,Such A Long Waste Of My Time...,"I found this book to be amazingly boring, not very captivating and hard to follow. The characters are developed too late in the novel and the storyline is blurred between all of the side stories. The langauge is offensive (or hard to understand) and the side tales are too graphic for my tastes.I heard the movie was better."
1,Two Thumbs down!,"This novel was not only disgusting but it provokes feelings of hostility between Indians and Pakistanis. Writers should work to clear up any misunderstandings to make the situation better. Instead this author attempts to make the matters worse. By using abusive language for Pakistanis, Mistry has shown his narrow-mindedness. It is amazing how all the education the writer had have, made no difference to his prejudised mind."
4,"a powerful, moving story filled with humanity and character","mistry's first novel is a beautifully crafted, well-engineed tale of life in bombay. we are given characters to cherish and cheer for as we are taken through the daily rituals of life in india. i quite enjoyed the remarkable debut by a promising canadian author..."
4,Not as good as A Fine Balance but a good first novel,"I read this book after reading A Fine Balance and therefore am probably unfairly judging it. It doesn't have the depth and character development of the latter, but is a good first novel."
5,All I Could Ask for,I could not have asked for better service. I could not have asked for better service. I could not have asked for better service.
4,Oh my,"I love this author. I recently read SUCH A FINE BALANCE and was still reeling from that story when i began this. That was a mistake. I should have given myself time between the two because this story did not move me as much. It is very well written like all his books. the story is about a man who is struggling with being good and providing for his family and being tempted to being corrupt to provide even better. The descriptions of India and Bombay are so explicit, i felt it, i smelled it, i was there. This is a magnificent author"
4,Nice glimpse of Mumbai/India !,"Very well written, and gripping book. It is an excellent glimpse of India, as it was in the 1970's. Mistry is an excellent writer, and he keeps the reader involved in his narrative."
3,Bogged Down with Detail,Mistry paints a vivid portrait of his protagonist's world and the world surrounding him.India is clearly evoked but his excellent detail bogs down the progress of his story and makes for a very slow read.Wish I could be more enthusiastic.
2,Fair - no comparison to A Fine Balance,"After reading A Fine Balance I couldn't wait to read another book by this author. I then read his third book called Family Matters which was good but I was disappointed as it by no means compared to A Fine Balance. I just finished Such A Long Journey and found it to be okay but very slow moving and downright boring in some spots. It is my least favorite of the three books by this author. It's hard to believe that someone can right a book like A Fine Balance, which was magnificant and one of the best books I have ever read, and then turn our stuff that is, at best, average."
3,Perhaps I should have not read A Fine Balance first,"I truly enjoyed this book but it failed to meet my high expectations of Mistry's compelling and totally engrossing story-telling. It is a great story but if left me wishing for more depth and impact. Perhaps my biggest mistake is that I read A Fine Balance a few years ago and it still haunts me. It is such an intense journey, none of his other work has come close to it, in my opinion."
2,Not enough noise for sleep,"I bought this item when my other fan died. I use a fan for ""white noise"" while I sleep as it gives me a deeper, more restful sleep.The other reviewers said that it had a good breeze on the low setting and was too noisy. So, I thought, ""This is the fan for me."" Boy, was I wrong. It is quieter than my last fan. It doesn't blow too strongly. I am waking up at night drenched in sweat!!The only thing I like about this fan is that it is remote controlled. That is why it got 2 stars.If you are like me and wanting this for the white noise it may produce. Skip it!"
1,Terrible Book.,"I have never read anything that resembled utter junk than this. I must congratulate the author on his esoteric-convoluted writing style, because it has made understanding the concepts that much more difficult.This book has absolutely no merit what so ever. In fact, this book is so bad, I will burn my book rather then selling it to fool some other prospecting buyer into thinking this is a good book.YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!!!!"
2,"not their best, but good for completists",The 13 Unlucky Numbers is a better album. I actually re-bought this since I had forgotten I had heard it years ago and had given it away since I didn't really like it. And so this one goes into the charity bin as well....
1,Are you 11 or 12 years old? Then you'll LOVE this band!,"To use the word ""punk"" anywhere near this band is an affront to everything punk stands for. Wax is a bland ooze of shmaltzy schlock. If you want a light, pop sound, try Marcy Playground or the Amps, but avoid this unorginal and vapid band."
2,Not nearly as warm as advertised,"This hat was a great disappointment, it is nowhere near as warm as other comments made it seem."
3,a fun read,"while i found this book to be fast paced and very interesting, i also was disappointed in its lack of depth.the 'space' terminology, slang, wierd, futuristic thingies like nutricubes and vividly 'visual' desriptions were well worth the read.however, i was left feeling a little like the author copied from johnny 5 is alive (what was that movie called anyway??).this is a great book for reluctant readers and young readers of science fiction. older readers and advanced younger readers will probably be left wanting more."
3,Entertaining but lacks anything really new,"Spacer and Rat is quite a fun story about the life in a human colony far in the future. Its high amount of action makes it a quick read. But that's all I can say about the whole story. The rest is mostly adapted from other works: people in the colonies (spacers) have prejudice against ""Earthies"" (called rats), but one decides to be different and ends up helping one to solve a problem related to a rogue self-aware robot (technology that is forbidden everywhere). Deja vu?"
2,Item arrived broken...twice.,This product was poorly packaged. The first one I ordered arrived broken. The replacement arrived broken. I will order it from other website.
2,"Low Price, Low Quality","This was an ""Emergency Purchase"" to serve as a Turkey Platter for a Christmas Eve Party, cancelled [luckily] at the last minute.Such a rarely-used item really annoys me, taking up 'valuable' cabinet space in my small kitchen. but the Eastside, while actually rather small for turkeys, looked like a SideBoard item for other uses.The design looked appealing in the small photo and I probably associated Pfaltzgraff with 'German Quality'. Big Mistake! It's certainly not total junk, but let's just say it's out of place on a white Table Cloth or a Rosewood Buffet, Indeed, I'd have guessed the price at 1/2 of the $30 I paid. That's sad really as the concept shows real style and excellence but whoever chose the means of execution apparently was totally lacking in these areas."
4,I was blessed by the songs,"I was really blessed and encouraged by the ministry of the Gospel Warriors. The Divine Nature title song touched me the most. I was able to see the live in Orlando, Fl. and I give them 5 stars. I understand why they say ""exciting"" MW - Tampa, Florida"
5,"Great, if overpriced, collection","Caswell Massey almond is my favorite scent in lotions and fragrances -- this is a nice gift set. As always, CM stuff is overpriced for what it is, but since it's special order and not sold mass market, I understand why."
4,Informative Look at Methodology,In the opening section of the book he approaches his subject philosophically. He talks about he role a critic plays in analyzing and providing a framework. From this context he goes on to describe the method.A section is devoted to rhetorical cristism and how it includes must more than the spoken word. From here he places rhetoric in a more general context.Critics from various historical epochs are cited. He contributes his own thoughts to the issue as it is passed down from one generation to the next. This book makes some insightful points and is worthy of attention for those interested in continuing the discussion.
2,"Smells great, but doesn't work great","Do not love anything about this product other than the smell and the bottle. The spray doesn't wipe up like windex and takes forever to actually dry. Don't see any impressive results to make the aggravation while cleaning actually worth it. I really wanted to love this because I love that it smells like mint, love the bottle and love method products. But, I am going to keep the bottle and buy the windex refill to use in it. :)"
5,The Bee's Knees,"I've used this glass cleaner for months, and it works like a charm. Leaves zero streaking, smells fresh (mmm, minty). I was actually surprised at how well it worked the first time I used it simply because I've never had good luck with glass cleaners. A++"
2,Smells Wonderful But is Not Effective,"I love that this spray is a more natural product than Windex, and I LOVE the way it smells, but that is all. The product leaves lots of streaks no matter how many times I go over it, and simply does not clean glass or mirrors very well at all. I really don't understand the glowing reviews. Will continue looking for a better product."
2,"Not effective for window cleaning, smells fine","I have tried other Method products and enjoyed them all until now. Smells like peppermint which is nice, but horrible film left on Windows after cleaning. Not worth the price since it doesn't do the job. Back to Windex until I find something else."
5,Excellent,"This product cleans well - works well on monitor and TV screens. It has a pleasant mint scent (rather strong for the first minute or so, then fades) which, for me, is an added advantage - I have a couple of tom cats that spray anything and everything they can reach - including my monitor. They apparently don't like the scent of this cleaner - they haven't sprayed my monitor since I started using this. I haven't tried a quick spritz in other areas yet - but this works better than any of the ""cat away"" products I've tried."
1,"Great idea, terrible execution","A cup-at-a-time coffeemaker is a great idea, but this one was poorly designed and performed unacceptably. First of all, the water flows into the grounds so quickly that the compartment overflows. Second of all, because of the way it's made, when that happens the water with coffee grounds in it backs up into the water reservoir, which becomes filthy with coffee grounds. Third, because of the way it's made, it's not possible to open up the reservoir sufficiently to clean it out. So pretty quickly you've got some old coffee grounds stuck in the water reservoir, and your coffee starts tasting bad as a result. I ultimately gave up and got an electric kettle and a cone filter, that works much better."
3,"Not fancy, but does the job","There's no bells or whistles to this coffeemaker. Just fill it up with water, put your ground coffee in the basket, and press the button! It works fast and the coffee is piping hot. The only beef I have is that if you aren't super careful about how you pour the water in, it could get into the basket area and start dripping out before you have your cup under the dispenser. Otherwise, a good buy for the money, and I get to have coffee when my husband takes the whole carafe from our regular coffee maker to work!"
3,1 cup coffee maker,"This one cup coffee maker is a great way for me to 'grab' a cup of coffee during the day. My wife is a tea drinker and usually I would not set up the large coffee maker just for one cup. Now, she can have her tea and I can have my coffee. The coffee is hot and drinkable which, for me says it all."
4,Had to request a replacement . . .,"The coffeemaker was ordered by my Assistant, and the unit received did not heat the water sufficiently. She called the company, and they sent a replacement that works sufficiently. All in all, the price is good and it's just what she needed which was a single-serve coffeemaker where you could use your own coffee and not be limited to ""pods""."
2,"Redesigned to ""fancy""shape... for worse...","I have this cofee maker that I purchased in 1993. Ideal for office use - makes just one cup. Still works. I purchased new one for other office where I work. Unfortunately, shape was redesigned to ""fancy"" ane ""futuristic"". Look nicer, but the shape is such that it is not possible to pour a cup of water not spilling a half. ""If not broken, don't fix it, B&D""..."
5,Question - How long does it take to heat water?,"Sorry - this is not a review - question for those posting reviews.I'm looking for info on how long it takes this coffeemaker to make a cup of hot water. Considering purchasing as gift, and can't find that info anywhere on their website!If you've used this to make tea or hot chocoloate, can you tell me how long it takes to heat up a cup of water?Thanks!"
2,Doesn't brew hot coffee!,"Yes, it's convenient. However, the coffee is not steaming hot and tastes not good at all."
4,Quick and Easy!,"I purchased 3 of these for under $5 each(they make excellent Christmas presents). It works super-quick, gets the water extremely hot. The built-in filter is good - saves me from having to buy filters when I make coffee.I like not having a pot - just using my glass.My only complaint is that there is no off button - you just press the button down, and it heats/pours all the water in it until it's empty. This could be bad if you put more water in it than your glass holds."
1,Makes more mess than coffee,"I had high hopes for this item. I needed something for the office. I've used this cup coffee maker three times and it made more mess than coffee. Here are the problems:- Drink your coffee quick as there is no heated base to keep it warm. Need to provide your own cup, too.- Coffee overflows into water reserve. Difficult cleaning the grounds out of the water reserve.- Move that cup, and the coffee keeps flowing out over everything. Rinse the coffee basket, and water flows out. You either have to rinse your cup again or put a paper towel down to collect the drips.Not worth the hassle. Don't cut corners; get a decent machine."
1,"Loved it, then it was dead","I purchased this little coffee pot on December 10th and got it a couple of days later. I loved the little thing. I don't use it everyday, so maybe it had about 7 days of use. This morning, January 6th, it was dead. I've written to Black and Decker, but it's not worth fighting about, so I guess it's money out the window."
1,Horrible plastic taste in new model!,"I had an old Cup-at-a-Time in my old workplace, and it was great! But I bought one for my new workplace, and am very disappointed with the horrible plastic taste that I cannot get rid of. I have scrubbed it out, run a vinegar solution through it, run a baking soda solution through it, even run fresh-squeezed lemon juice through it, and many, many changes of water, but the tea still tastes strongly of plastic.I'm going to try a metal electric teakettle instead."
4,"Fast,, Small, Easy, Excellent...and HOT!","This is the neatness product for one or two coffee drinkers, like me. It does one cup at a time quickly and then shuts itself off. It has a built-in fine screen filter so no more filter fumbling and buying. It takes up very little counter space or small enough to tuck away in your kit cabinet like you would a 28oz can of beans.It brews so quickly, two or even three people can have coffee in about the same time it would take a bigger coffee maker to do. A must have for limited counter spaces. I do not see the faults others have mentioned here in mine?The only improvement I could think of is a buzzer when it is done, but it brews so quickly this is no biggy and I set my kitchen timer for 1 minute as a reminder."
4,Single Cup Coffee Maker,"I had a similar product 18 years ago and it worked real well. This latest product I bought doesn't do too bad a job. The only significant difference is that it doesn't heat the water hot enough. But all in all, it's doable."
4,A Great and Convenient Coffee Maker,"I've had this coffee maker for about two weeks now and both my husband and myself are very happy with the purchase. It is very convenient and works very well, brewing a cup of coffee in about 3 minutes. The only improvements I'd like to see to this product would be to make it just a little taller. While some of my 12 oz coffee cups do fit, I have others that do not. Also, you have to poor the water in from the left side wich makes it a little less convenient for the right handed."
4,Great for traveling,"This is just the right size to bring along with you on trips, or in an office. It takes up a really small amount of space. It's ideal for those of us who just want that one or maybe two cups of coffee. I love the size, all the other one cup makers took up twice as much space. This makes a great gift too for those friends and relatives who do alot of traveling."
4,Love my coffeemaker,"I used the Cup-at-a-time when visiting my sister. I loved it so much that I ordered one for myself. It is so easy and simple that it has made my morning much less stressful. The fact that it shuts off automatically after brewing is a great safety feature. I never have to worry whether I turned off the coffeemaker as I'm driving to work. There is virtually no cleanup and best of all the coffee tastes great. I highly recommend this product for those who need just one cup of coffee at a time, as I do."
2,Inconsistent performance - Flawed design,"I ordered one of these for work, despite reading mixed reviews. This is a coffeemaker which works inconsistently and often requires you to monitor it while it is running to avoid leakage. If the steam curls the filter to one side or if the coffeemaker is not perfectly level, the coffee tends to drain down the back of the cup, onto the base, and under the unit, getting the surrounding area wet. I have tried multiple types of filters, tried different configurations, different types of cups, etc but still inconsistent performance. A design engineer friend looked at it and told me that the area where the coffee drains should be out further, to hit the center of a typical cup, rather than nearer the back. I would suggest spending the extra money and purchasing a product which works more efficiently - who has the time to babysit a coffeemaker?"
4,"Fine, but small...","We are replacing another single cup coffee maker with this one and were disappointed to find that the space to put the cup is much smaller than our previous maker. We have very few cups that fit into the opening. Otherwise, it works fine..."
2,Tricky to fill,I had a Cup-At-A-Time for many years when it finally started to fail. It wouldn't empty the tank completely leading to a partially filled cup. It worked well for such a long time that I didn't hesitate to purchase the new model. Well the new one performs just fine but the shape has been changed. The new shape is a bit futuristic and is difficult to fill without spilling some water on the countertop. The old shape had a square top which presented a large area to lean the cup against when filling. The new shape has a pointed and curved area at the top which requires greater accuracy when pouring the water into the tank.
1,Sent to wrong Address!,This product was misdirected by USPS so didn't arrive at my home for three weeks after the promised date. I did not accept it and hopefully was credited. I would love to have used it but by the time it came I had purchased a different one.
2,Would not recommend,"This is the second Cup at a Time I've had; they're nice when they work but don't last very long. The on switch quits working and that's it.If you don't mind buying a new one every couple of months, they're OK."
4,Perfect for one!,I love this one cup coffee maker. It's fast and easy to clean. Automatic shut off is a plus. I had tried the Toastess and there is no comparison. The B&D is better quality for the money. The Toastess took forever and is very cheaply made. Great product! Only down side is you can't use extra large coffee cups.
4,good product,"Makes a good cup of coffee. However, for me it needs to be hotter. So I microwave it. I bought this because it was the same as the one I had. The only difference was the water basket. The new one has a much smaller opening to pour the water in. So you have to have good aim to get all the water in. Otherwise some of the water never makes it in."
2,For warm coffee drinkers...,If you like cooled off coffee you'll like this coffee maker. Water flows thru so fast that the water does not get hot. It is also difficult to pour water into the top of the coffee maker without it spilling outside. Great idea - wish water was hot and you were able to use your coffee cup to pour the water into the base.
3,Not hot enough,"Makes a good cup of coffee. I don't need my coffee searingly hot, however, coffee turns luke warm if you don't drink it as soon as it's done. Don't order this product if you like your coffee hot."
1,Black and Decker Single Serve Coffee Maker,"I was not happy with this coffee maker for several reasons. First of all, my coffee cups would not fit into the area under the drip spout. Secondly, it did not keep the coffee warm. Our previous single coffee maker had a warming plate where the coffee cup sat and kept the coffee hot. I would not recommend this coffee maker to anyone."
5,My ol' faithful...,"I love my coffee maker. Hubby is not a coffee drinker so just 1-2 cups I drink per day, this is PERFECT. My daughter had to have one when she left home for college. Maybe I'm lucky (or maybe it'll break tomorrow because I state this...) but I've had mine over 15 years. It gets a daily workout and makes perfect coffee each time. Although the 'fad' is getting a pre-made coffee 'pod' these days, my comparison in price is NOT a drive through coffee shop price so to me, the pods are expensive. I would HIGHLY recommend this coffee maker and it doesn't take up much counter space."
3,keep the box and return label handy,"I think this product works fine as advertised, though nothing taller than a standard 12oz cup will fit.However, I sent the first one back after only 30 days because it stopped working. Never turned on again.Had the second one for about 8 more months. Now it stopped working. Won't turn on anymore. This replacement cost about $8 in shipping so it wasn't FREE. So after $23 and 9 months, no coffee maker again.If you want to rent this model for $20+ per year, it's fine. If you want something you don't have to buy again and again, it's not."
1,Disappointing.....,"The on/off switch broke five months after I purchased this product - bought it in May 2009; switch malfunctioned in September 2009. I only make one cup of coffee a day, so it wasn't a matter of over-use. Prior to this, I'd been very satisfied, but now I feel like I've thrown money down a hole."
4,Good for one short cup of coffee,"I broke my roommate's glass craft for an older coffee maker, so I brought her this to replace it. She's needs her one cup of coffee every morning, and she has found that this little machine does the trick. The only thing I can say (I don't use it) is that some of the taller coffee mugs won't fit under the dispenser, so be aware. But otherwise, it has been a great little machine."
3,just OK,"Makes an adequate cup of coffee. I find it hard to get the water in without dampening the filter basket, but if I take the basket out first, I'm good. If you like STRONG coffee, this is not the maker for you as extra coffee grounds will spew back up into the works and be hard to remove. I'm also adding a paper filter (technically unnecessary) to slow the water through the grounds for more strength, and that helps. If you just like ordinary coffee, this maker does get the job done."
3,"Functional, no frills, average coffee","The product is as simple as a drip coffee maker gets. An on/off switch, and that's about it. I like that you don't need a special cup/mug for it, and can use any standard-sized 12 oz. coffee mug for it to brew into. I don't think it will fit a larger size. It's very compact on my desk, and brews a cup pretty fast.But I guess with price and size, you lose some quality. The filter is a very fine mesh, and not as ""open"" as many other filters. With the short brew time, the resulting brew is weaker than is desirable. If you like a stronger coffee, I suggested a finer ground of beans than you would normally use for a drip machine. Paper filters may also help some.Overall, a product for convenience, not quality, but with some brew-engineering, it may be able to turn out some decent coffee."
3,Adequate,"I like the one cup feature, but it does have its idiosyncracies. It leaks water while you are trying to add water. I have to put a cup under the spout while I fill it. The coffee doesn't stay hot long, either.It does clean up easily.Overall, once I figured out how to avoid problems, it works very well."
3,turn on and forget,"I found this product to be satisfactory. It is easy to clean and does not require much maintanance.The only this I did not like, is that it has a small reservoir and it does not allow for some of the taller cups to be used."
3,Just what we needed,"This one-cup coffemaker was actually purchased for my son-in-law who is serving in Afghanistan.While speaking with him,I asked him if he needed anything and he said a pot that makes exactly one cup of hot water-for hot chocolate,cup-a-noodles and so on.I ordered this product because it was exactly a cup measurement. I recieved it and shipped it off in its original pkg.. He recieved it and says it was just what he needed.Thanks!Supporting Our Troops"
4,Good coffee maker,Heats the water to 180 degrees F which is hot enought to brew green tea and make a good cup of coffee. It is well worth the amount of money I paid for it. I do recomend this product.
5,Perfect for a single cup,"I have read a lot of reviews and must say this product works perfectly. Yes, there is a plastic taste the first couple of times you use it, but just be patient, it will disappear. Maybe use some great strong Kona coffee like I did. I get a perfect hot single cup of coffee. As for the mug, I must admit no mugs I had fit, but simply go to Walmart, measure how high your mug need to be using your finger, and I purchased 2 for under 5 bucks. Problem solved."
2,Not too informative,This item is not at all what I had thought. I was seeking a guide more practical than Lawtons but still informative. It is merely a list of moss names and where they fit in bryophyte taxonomy. I soon sought book recommendations from professional botantists.
5,"Inspired, Hilarious Filmmaking","I chanced upon this one (like most of us) by accident. Don't take it too seriously. On the surface, it looks like a ""profound movie"", when in fact it is satirizing those type of self-important flicks. It still manages, mostly I think by accident, to have a few serious messages. Primarily, the movie moves from one hilarious and/or surreal scene to another, the story slowly coming together. The scene with the impressionist in the desert is one of the funniest I have ever seen on film, period. It isn't perfect - the pacing drags in places, and some comic scenes just don't work. Nonetheless, you won't be disappointed."
2,Bizarre to say the most!!,"I guess I am one of those who just does not get this movie! I found it boring and difficult to sit through for 130 minutes. I guess there is supposed to be a point to all the madness, but I never saw it. There was no plot, and the acting was poor in most cases. In my opinion, there are far better movies out there!"
5,Perfect size for baking needs,"I am always pleased when I receive my products from Barry Farm. The products are vacuum-sealed and hence tamper-resistant. If I order more than one product, they are placed in an extra bag to keep them from jostling about in the box. The products are then packed safely-embedded in a cushion of packing peanuts and arrive very quickly after ordering them. I had to order them direct from Barry Farm because sadly Amazon does not ship groceries to FPOs, but I had previously browsed Amazon to find the products I needed. I highly recommend Barry Farm to anyone who is a serious baker and is unable to find gourmet baking items in their area. That was me."
5,844 CMOS battery replacement,"I have a very old Gateway 486 computer that uses the 844 BIOS backup battery. I could not find this battery anywhere in the Toledo, OH, area, but Amzon had a more modern replacement for the old unit. The new battery works great and I am very happy that I was able to get one from Amazon.com."
4,Analysis,"Arna Bontemps delivers an overview that is often overlooked in American history books, the African American migration. Bontemps decribes the hardships and struggles of Africans searching for a better life. To really enjoy the drama and detail of this novel, you must realize the impact that African Americans had on the history of America. I believe that this book gives a great presentation of black americans depicting the theme of hope, with disappointment, and love of life, and the struggle to gain that, any place but here (in the South). Although it is not grand reading material, you will learn a lot."
5,Learning To Think Mathematically,"This is an excellent textbook in that its primary emphasis is on some of the great ideas in mathematics and effective thinking. Topics covered are numbers, infinity, geometry, topology, chaos and fractals, uncertainty, and decision making. The text is replete with myriad illustrations which assist the student in grasping key ideas. Text would be excellent for a liberal arts math course, an enrichment course for middle school and high school teachers, or as a course for advanced high school students. Comes with 3D glasses and exploration CD.In summary, conveys the beauty of mathematics while teaching students to think."
1,Pseudo-math text,"I tried using this text for a Liberal Arts undergrad course, and I would never use this book again. The jokey writing style is patronizing, offensive and ultimately fails to provide a viable alternative to a more traditional approach. Some of the examples and proofs are erroneous (that of the Brouwer fixed point theorem, for example). The pious pronouncements about ""effective thinking"" are just cynical and disingenuous. I had to include a large amount of supplementary material just to explain how to do the exercises, which the authors never bothered to do. They were to busy dropping trou and pandering.You have heard of ""truthiness""? Well, what this book has is ""mathiness"". It gives the appearance of presenting mathematical ideas in an effective way, when in fact it does no such thing."
2,Don't waste your time,The product was fine...but this may be the worst math book you could buy! Get something IB (International Baccalaureate) approved.
2,I disagree with the implied goal of this book,"I disagree with the implied goal of this book to give people who are unable and/or unwilling to learn mathematics an easy way to fulfill a mathematics requirement. When are mathematicians going to face the fact that not everyone can enjoy and do mathematics? Do we ask students to read Dr. Seuss in fulfillment of a literature requirement?The world is already filled with too many people who think they understand mathematics and who are practicing mathematics. The real challenge is to educate those who are able and willing to learn mathematics and ensure that mathematics is applied competently.But if one wants to make a buck selling mathematics books, this is the way to do it. I'm reminded of the quotation: ""No one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American people."" - Attributed to H. L. Mencken"
3,Heart of Mathematics Review,"Delivery was very prompt. The binding on the cover is coming off, which I didn't know beforehand, but besides that the general condition of the book was good."
1,dark and scary,"I was horrified to read this book to my children. For the vast majority, this book is unnecessarily scary and negative. It may have a ""redeeming message"" and perhaps would be useful in a situation where a child might really face these horrors. BUt the average family would be better off avoiding this one."
1,"Avoid, this book creates negative stereotypes.","Must aggree with other negative posts. Although the author has good intentions, this book is too complex for kindergarteners who may sadly create negative stereotypes of Blacks based on the depictions in the book.However, this book may be appropriate for childeren who have encountered urban riots and other street violence.Unfortunately I will have to solicite my child's kindergarten library to remove the book or at least place a warning indicating the book contains complex social issues."
4,A new view of urban violence,"Bunting takes a bold step by bringing the LA riots to life through the eyes of a child. Though not the ideal bed time story, Smoky night is worth being read. It conveys the message of the effects of urban violence on a child but also tells a beautiful tale of coming together. Daniel and his cat stare out their apartment window at the streets below as people loot the stores. He can not understand why this is happening, how people can look angry and happy at the same time. As Daniel and his mother sleep, a fire breaks out in their building. In the confusion their cat is lost as well as the cat of Mrs. Kim, a Korean shop owner where Daniel's mother never goes. Perhaps a tad cornybut effective is Bunting's use of the two cats coming together to find comfort and security in a time of crisis. The illustrations of David Diaz fill the pages with bright neon colors. His use of multi media to create unique chaotic pictures, complimentary to the story being told."
1,Not appropriate for this age group!,"While this book attempts to view the LA riots through the eyes of a child, it never actually gives any historical context, thus making the likelihood of the reader's understanding less and less with each passing year. The only tolerance shown in the book is by cats, and while young children identify with animals, this moral is a stretch even to adults. The artwork is lovely, but that only serves to highlight the poor and age-inappropriate story line."
3,What happens to Daniel?,Smokey Nights won a Caldecott Medal. There are good illustrations. I recommend this book for you. This is a story about a boy named Daniel. He lives in a bad neighborhood with lots of rioting. Read this book to find out what happens to Daniel.
3,WARNING!,"While I thought the book was great for discussion, I was not exactly ready for that when I read it. My 4 year old had picked it from the shelf from the library. He loves ""the books with the medals"". (Great taste!) He wanted to read it before bed so I said ""Sure!"" and cuddled up for a good read...OOPS! Please folks...pre-read this and be prepared for the questions! NOT a good bedtime story, but a good book."
4,I love the message in the end.,"I thought the story was very interesting, a little sad, but with a happy ending. The message I got in the end with Daniel and Mrs. Kims cat is that if you get to know a person, you never know, you just may like them. I think it is an excellent message if young kids can understand it on their own, and if not I think it should be explained either during or after the story."
3,Attractively Done,The layout of the book was good. Format colorful and attractive. The book may not include as many rhymes as other books on the same subject.
1,read the fine print about training techniques,"When I first flipped through this book I was surprised and dismayed to see that the author promotes the use of painful and potentially injurious collars such as the choke collar and/or prong collar. That alone was enough to make me return the book--NO dog collar should poke or choke! There's also lots of info about cats, which is legitimate enough, but since most readers will be training one or the other, and not both, this amounts to wasted text (for which you pay). I'd recommend going online and digging up some info on getting your dog into film or TV, and buying a book like Dog Tricks for Dummies in the meantime. Cute cover, but I returned this one because of the choke-collar issue. FYI, I have an energetic German Shepherd who I pleasantly and successfully trained 100% through positive methods. It is totally possible to do this--I don't care WHAT you're training for (TV, search and rescue, family pet, etc.)."
3,Didn't fit,"Product didn't fit my vacuum even though it was on the list. Informed the company and they allowed me to return an opened package no questions asked. So, good company, bad item description."
5,Got sick of paying $9.99 for (2) bags at the store,I'm not wasting my money on kenmore brand bags any more! At sears the kenmore bags are $9.99 for just 2 bags! rip-off! Here you get tons of bags for a cheap price! & they work just as good!!!!
4,great,"happy with my purchase, It will be very handy to me, not big enough but is comfortable and good quality."
3,Too Small but nice,It was a great bag for a meduim sized person. Not to say that it cant fit alot in it. IT CAN FIT A LOT OF STUFF IN IT. but from the outside you look like a grown man with a baby bookbag on. i returned and got a bigger bag
3,Molle none functional,"Molle strap spacing is a bit far apart for it to be used very well with most molle accessories. Bag is of good construction and if you do not need the extra pouches on it then it should do nicely for a bag of this size. I do not like the shoulder strap construction. Could have been a bit beefier for this size pack. For the money though, this is a well thought out bag."
2,Not A Very Good Pack,"The pack is small, we're talking 13"" computer, a book, a binder, and notebook and that's all she wrote for the main compartment. The rest of the stuff that you'd expect to carry will pretty well fit in the pack but the shoulder straps, compression, and hip-belt are all poorly designed. Do yourself a favor and go look for a pack made by a reputable company that has years in the business and is sold at outdoor outfitter stores.Returned purchase and got a good bag."
5,Idaho's geshtalt,"Well, I've never written about music, but I think this band - whoever they are - are a band worth condsidering. I find myself truly moved by the mood of this music. At times, it can be incredibly beautiful. Singer/songwriter Jef Martin has a deep soul that he struggles to share with us on this record. It is an uphill battle at first, but I have found Idaho to be a great surprise. Great music. To drive to. Or write to. Or look at the world to. Or just listen to. It will be worth it."
1,You've got to be kidding!!!,First I want to say that this CD was given to me as a gift so no money was spent on it by me and as I have never heard of this band before just let me say thank god for that! I don't know if this is their first music CD but this stuff is terrible. The lyrics don't flow with the music and the lead singers tone and voice is really bad. I listened to each cut for about 45 seconds and I could take no more! This CD is now in the Possession of a thrift store and pity the next owner!
1,Very unusefull,"Poor content, not suitable for board studies. Only one chapter with xrays (very basic info)"
2,My fault I suppose...,"... but I made a mistake in buying this. I like comics, and of late I've wanted to buy all the graphic novels I can about Apocalypse. When I saw this then, I'd bought it within seconds. However, knowing nothing about ""The Age of Apocalypse"" previous to buying this I had no idea that said villain appears in the book on about 2 pages. Taken by itself I suppose these books are fine, but I wanted a book where Apocalypse is an ever present threat and actually gets his boot in. Does anyone know where I can go to get this?"
2,Expected More,"When purchasing this book, I was expecting something that dealt more with Apocalypse. Instead it jumps around giving seperate stories, many that have nothing to do with Apocalypse at all. I think Apocalypse only makes an appearance in a couple of pages. If you really ant to read the age of apocalypse story line, this doesn't seem the way. Hopefully volume two, which I still plan to read, is much better."
5,Classic else world story,The art may flip flop but it still work's as a storyRead it if you haven't yet and are a comic book nerd
1,Very Little Apocalypse,"How can you have The Complete Age of Apocalypse Epic, Book 1? If it is only book #1 it isn't very complete now is it?As it is, this volume contains very little of the actual story line, most of the book is filler mini-series made after the fact.Poor execution on this book and not recomended."
3,Should NOT have been Book 1,"I was a big fan of the Age of Apocalypse story when it originally came out, and was happy to see that Marvel was collecting the storyline in a series of trade paperbacks. What I don't understand is the logic behind the issues collected in volume 1. This should have been the start of the saga and been comprised of X-Men Alpha and a couple of the more important limited series like Astonishing X-Men, Factor X, or Amazing X-Men. Instead, Marvel packaged all of the random throwaway AoA stories like the Blink limited series and an X-Man annual. These aren't bad stories, and most should have been part of the collections, but certainly not in book 1. This volume would have been more appropriate as a follow-up book to the real AoA series. Maybe it makes sense from a marketing perspective, since if these stories were collected in a later volume it might have been easier for fans to skip it altogether. It certainly doesn't make sense from a storyline point of view though."
3,Hoping for the good stuff....,"This volume encompasses several stories that are only connected because they happened in the same time line. The stories jump from event to event. This was frustrating, since I purchased this book because I had read many of these before and was curious about the stories surrounding them. What I ended up with was a little more information and a lot more confusion.One of the stories featured in Volume 1 centers around Forge and X-Man, aka Nate Grey. It involves time travel, Sugarman, and removing microbes from Niagara Falls. There were implications that Nate passes through Forge's lab on a regular basis, but beyond that, the story left me very confused.The positives - The artwork, while differing from story to story, was pleasing on the whole. The characters were decent-looking and the stories hint at greater things to come. Marvel could have done a better job of arranging it, or could have at least given readers a clearer idea of what to expect."
4,Age of Apocalypse-The Prequel,"I have to disagree with the people who think this was an ill advised attempt to rip off the comic reading consumer. Because of their advice I skipped Volume 1 and went directly to Volume 2, and spent a long time trying to figure out what was going on in this counter universe. I now see that if taken as a prequel (because it really doesn't feature Apocalypse) it offers all the background you need to understand what is to follow. It would have made for a more enjoyable read. OK, I do agree that the Blink mini-series was ill placed, but I feel the Marvel team felt they needed to bulk up the book to make it worth the money."
5,Very funny movie!,This was a great movie to watch after all the clean up of the day was done. It was a great to sit and watch this movie and laugh like anything. Really enjoyed it. Thanks.
1,Disappointed.,"I loved this when I saw it on tv, and ordered this as soon as I saw it available. Unfortunately, the 'bleeps' tend to detract from the show. If I had known that an uncensored version wasn't included, I wouldn't have bothered buying it."
2,Something just off,"Dunham is outstanding, but this special seemed to fall flat for me. Achmed wanted a hug ... The guitar guy segment, while amusing, was not as good as the YouTube clip where you could tell it was fresh. Walter's time was short and I tend to think he sets up the other puppets for success. Reading the x-mas story with Peanut was ok...I just couldn't get a common thread through it all ... There was no lotion to link the act together or blue frickin prius to make fun of.So, for me, it fell flat as several short acts instead of something of a story from different points of view. And that scaredy cat Achmed was just disturbing."
2,Watch what you buy,"I bought this DVD expecting to get the usual great Jeff Dunham video. What Amazon doesn't say is this is a censored copy from Comedy Central; I don't buy a DVD to get a ""bleeped"" version. This is the only Jeff Dunham special I have (and I have them all) that is this type of copy. Amazon should make sure the customer knows they are NOT getting the full version."
5,Hillarious,"When it comes to Jeff Dunham and his ""friends"" I am a sucker. I love to watch him making everyone smile. And there are times in this that you cant help but laugh uncontrollably. Guitar Guy, just one of those moments."
5,A laugh a minute,"If you need a good laugh, this disk is for you. I have A Very Special Christmas Special. I was laughing so hard,I was wipeing away tears of mirth. I would recomend this Jeff fa fa disk to any one for any occation."
2,Censored,"This is a review for the blu-ray, not the special.The blu-ray is censored. No option given for unscensored. Waist of your money. Who wants to pay for beeps!?"
5,always funny,This guy is so talented. If you like humor you will love Jeff Dunham. Warning is do not watch with your children. Definitely not a PG.
5,SOMETHING SPECIAL,"My favorite Jeff Dunham's ever!!! Achmed and Guiter Man had me laughing so hard, there were tears in my eyes. Simply the best!"
5,Jeff Dunham's christmas special,"the DVD is better than the Comedy Central special, there is a lot more in the DVD than the special. One of Jeff's best shows!"
5,Jeff Dunham's very special Christmas Special,"Once again Jeff has done it, a very entertaining tape with the gang. I can't wait till his next tape comes out."
3,Jeff's Christmas Special DVD,"I love Jeff Dunham's work he is a master at his craft, however this DVD lacks the Zing that the first two DVD's had. Worth the watch there are some funny bits."
2,"Disappointed, would not recommend","I saw the TV special about Jeff Dunham and thought it was hilarious. Bought ""Spark of Insanity"" and that is a dvd I would recommend but this Christmas special was not that funny. There were a few parts with Walter and Achmed the dead terrorist that were somewhat funny but most of the other parts of the program were dull and I didn't appreciate the sexual content of some of the performance. I wish I had my money back."
2,Disc Damaged,I received the DVD before Christmas and was prompt. It was a gift and when the person put it in the DVD player there were no signs of scratches but the disc will not go to anything but the show and cuts off the last twenty minutes. I was not happy.
2,Jeff Dunham Cmas Special,"I'm a big Jeff Dunham fan and had to have this Cmas special in my collection. Turns out it's not very funny. I was disappointed. It's reasonably priced so is nice to have in my collection but it's just not near as funny as his other stuff. If you're not big on a ""complete"" collection, I'd skip this one. You can check it out on You Tube for free instead."
5,JEFF DUNHAM VERY SPECIAL CHRISTMAS SPECIAL,I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO WATCH IT YET. I KNOW I WILL ENJOY IT BECAUSE HE REALLY IS FUNNY.
5,Better than the tv special,We have enjoyed all of the Comedy Central TV specials and were pleased that there is so much more on the DVD's to enjoy. I bought all 3 DVD's and I plan on buying the talking Peanut and Achmed dolls when they become available.
5,Jeff Dunham Christmas,Absolutely great. Our whole family watched this and we just loved it. I recommend it to anyone. Maybe not small children but anyone else. It is so funny. I think it is his best stand up so far.
4,Gotta love Jeff Dunham and friends,I had seen the special on Comedy Central before I ordered the DVD. I was delighted to find it offered on Amazon. I have his first two videos and I really wanted to make sure I had all of Jeff's DVDs. Amazon made it easy for me to get what I wanted at a price I was willing to pay. So keep up the good work Jeff and thank you Amazon!
4,Entertaining (as Jeff Dunham usually is),"We had a great time laughing with this show. Not quite as hilarious as others, but worth the money."
5,Friggin' hilarious...worth the purchase,"A reasonably priced BD with awesome content - cannot ask for much more. The picture and sound were perfect for an indoor performance (Pabst in Milwaukee). Admittedly, the DTS shined only when the crowd was involved, but it makes for a good auditorium sound test.The special features add some nice background (incl. in 1080) - with brief behind the scenes clips on the cover art photo shoot, the sleigh ride and the actual performance (complete with bazooka footage). Playing the two stand-up extras of ask Santa and Christmas Tips had my customers asking for copies.The 85 minutes goes by too fast but the foul language is bleeped out, so it makes for a great holiday watch with the entire family and doesn't seem too lengthy. A definite recommendation that makes for a solid gift this year."
5,Gut busting hilarity!!!,"I got to see Jeff Dunham in Bridgeport, CT on September 5th this year. He performed alot of the material for his Christmas DVD and it was absolutely hilarious!! I left the show with a sore stomach from laughing so hard!!!I can't wait to receive my copy of the DVD that I ordered"
1,My opinion,I have seen his 2 other DVD's and found them a lot better. This Christmas one just seemed to drag on and on. I didn't think the jokes were as good as the others. A bit of a let down but he still is very good at what he does...
2,Funny but censored?,I love Jeff Dunham but the fact that this is edited with the bleeps ruins the DVD. Amazon should somehow inform people that the DVD is edited. Wasted money buying this from Amazon
4,super funny,Not as good as his previous CD's but a must have for the set...Does have many funny starts on it- can't wait for the next part
4,got it before Christmas,"I was so worried it would not be here before Christmas, but I was lucky to get it before Christmas."
5,Hilarious!,"Jeff Dunham is tremendously funny! I would recommend any fan of any comedy acts to look into what Jeff does! Not only do I love his DVD's, but I've seen him live a couple of times, and no matter how much I watch, it makes me laugh until my stomach hurts!"
5,Funny as usual - a good christmas laugh,Jeff Dunham is a funny as usual. This made for a good christmas laugh. Highly recommend if you get his humor.
3,Better than Spark of Insanity,"I got this (and Spark of Insanity) after being introduced to Jeff Dunham with his ""Arguing With Myself"" DVD and laughing hysterically with that one! This one is good - it is funny and does introduce Achmed, who is quite the character!, and it does add a little more depth to all of the characters. It is definitely better than Spark of Insanity - which wasn't funny - to me - at all."
2,don't buy christmas dvd,don't buy this christmas dvd unless you want the censored version. They do not tell you that it is the censored version which I think is not right.amagine my surprise when I found out.the performance is great like all the rest but should not be censored.
3,Bleeped out words,"Jeff Dunham is hilarious, but this DVD is sensored! All of the cuss words are bleeped out. I was very disapointed with this purchase. I have purchased his other DVD's from Best Buy and Walmart and they are not sensored. Amazon.com should tell you BEFORE they sell you a sensored version of something."
2,Not as good as others,"I think he is incredibly talented but this was a bit disappointing---even his technique was weaker in some cases. I could have suggested tons of new characters and ideas that might have been just as funny or more---I realize that Jeff caters to an adult crowd--but I guarantee this will be played at some family gatherings where it won't be appropriate---I have it, I'll keep it but I won't recommend it."
3,Not necessarily Jeff Dunham's best work...,"I purchased this DVD for my dad as a Christmas present because he's a big fan of Jeff Dunham. And I figured this DVD would be as good as Arguing With Myself and Spark of Insanity.Well, sorry to say that that wasn't the case. I thought that it was ok, but it was dull and boring.There were some times where I did laugh and my dad laughed. But the DVD was just boring. Jeff probably spent more time talking about his daughter in the intro than the puppets did onstage. I just couldn't help but yawn at times.And what was really the big problem for me with the DVD were the BLEEPS whenever the puppets said something bad. I can understand why that's convenient when there are kids around, but when there are just adults watching, those bleeps aren't necessary. The DVD would have been better without the bleeps, seriously.Overall, the DVD was ok, but it wasn't that great. Arguing With Myself and Spark of Insanity were simply way better than this DVD."
4,Very Good But...,"I love Jeff Dunham, he is the funniest comedian out there! The shipping was great and very fast. The only problem I found is that this DVD is edited. (language content that is) None of his others are, so I dont know if I just bought the edited one, or if that is how it is. But, I wouldnt hesitate to buy again."
3,jeff dunham christmas special,This video is so very funny. The only problem is some of the language is offensive. I am a grown women and got embarresed.
5,Third Times The Charm!,This is his best one yet! You must get this to complete your collection. He has Achmed singing! Fantastic! Can't wait for the next one!!!
4,VERY SPECIAL CHRISTMAS BY JEFF DUNHAM,I LOVE JEFF DUNHAM'S HUMOR. HE HAS A STYLE ALL HIS OWN. I HIGHLY RECCOMMEND THIS DVD TO ANYONE WHO LIKES TO LAUGH!
3,disappointing,"We've been fans of Jeff for a long time so I ordered 3 of these for gifts based on what we've loved before. I was terribly disappointed and embarrased when we watched this with friends over Thanksgiving. Cruder, tasteless, and inappropriate compared to others, especially since it was a Christmas DVD and likely to be watched by families. I'm very sorry I bought these for gifts."
3,jeff dunham's christmas special,Disappointing start - better finish - but not nearly as funny as his 1st two DVDs
2,Won't buy another,"Loved his first DVD. This one is vulgar and full of ""F"" language. Will not buy another."
2,not family fare,I bought this dvd because the description said that it was fun for the whole family and I wanted to watch it with my grandchildren ages 6-13. I am so glad that I previewed it first. It definitely is not family fare. There is a lot of swearing and off-color jokes. I guess whoever produced this dvd figured that by bleeping out the worst offending vulgarities it would qualify as family entertainment. I do not agree. Both my husband and I shut it off before it was over. We were very disappointed with it and feel like we threw our money out the window. This dvd will go in the trash.
2,Kind of disappointed....,"I have Jeff's previous DVD's - Arguing with Myself and Spark of Insanity - and really like them. Sent them to my parents last year for Christmas, too. This year, I was excited about getting them an actual Christmas special of Jeff D. for the Christmas season. Visited over Thanksgiving and popped it in that evening. Was sad that the content was so often sexual/racy. He's such a funny and talented guy - I don't think he has to go down that road. Maybe it was the venue he was hosting that prompted the material. Who knows, but to do it over - I wouldn't purchase this DVD."
3,Dissapointed !!!,There is a reason why Jeff Dunham is so succesful. He is hilarious and spontaneous. He does this by letting things fly when you least expect them. So why ruin these moments by bleeping them out. Most fans did not pay for this dvd only to have it censored.
2,Not funny except in few places,"Mostly this special contains very ""pat"" humor. Also, I didn't like the bigoted jokes. Not funny. Not every Muslim is a terrorist, and vice versa."
4,Jeff Dunham,"This special begins with a monologue by Jeff and it is not ""up to snuff"". This is not a family video, there are racial jokes, language etc. This version is ""bleeped"". Jeff Dunham is very talented and always delivers a laugh!"
3,A little disappointed,"I got this thinking that it was going to be as funny as the rest of his. I was disappointed, it just wasn't as funny to me or my husband. Jeff it almost seemed like he just threw some stuff thogether. However, some of it was good."
5,Awesome comedian,"If you like to laugh until you are rolling on the floor and your stomach hurts, then purchase this dvd. I recommend seeing the first two dvds before watching this one. You don't necessarily have to but it helps to know the backgrounds. I highly recommend his dvds."
3,What the bleep?,"I like Jeff Dunham but was disappointed that the dvd was edited for language. I have watched Lewis Black and other comedians specials on Comedy Central and you expect the language to be censored, but when you see the dvds, they're unedited. This one had all the bleeps in, just as if you were watching it on television. That was annoying and ruined it for us when we watched it. Had I known this in advance, I would not have purchased it. I could have recorded it on my dvr with the same result. I will think twice before buying another one of his dvds if this is how they're producing them. As good as the show was, it was disappointing at the same time."
5,A great Christmas stocking stuffer,A really great Christmas special. And who ever would have thought Achmed could carry a tune. Filled with lots of great humor and bonus material. A Christmas must have.
4,A Large Gift-Wrapped Package of Laughs,"Jeff and his friends are joined by Guitar Guy, so they can sing Christmas songs. And stuff.Walter, an old curmudgeon with a face like a prune, refuses to say anything nice about Christmas.Achmed, the dead terrorist, sings Jingle Bombs.Bubba J, a beer swilling NASCAR fan, sings Road Kill Christmas.Peanut, who is something alien, I think, ""helps"" Jeff read ""Twas the Night Before Christmas."" He also cracks up Guitar Guy completely.Jose Jalapeno in a stick, tells how Christmas is celebrated in Mexico."
2,wanted the uncensored version,"Jeff Dunham is great. I really love his stuff. However, when I purchased the other DVDs they had the option to watch it censored or uncensored. This one does not. I would have liked it much more if I could have had the opportunity to see that version as well."
1,Very Disappointed,"I purchased the DVD because I really like Jeff and do not like ""bleeps"". SUPRISE...... The DVD has the same bleeps as on television. What a waste of money. SAVE YOUR MONEY and watch it on TV"
2,Disappointing,"I loved the first two Jeff Dunham DVDs (""Talking to Myself"", and ""A Spark of Insanity"") and was expecting this one to be great as well. Although it did have some funny sequences (like the improv and banter with the ""guitar guy""), it wasn't nearly as good as expected. I haven't seen the bonus features yet, but the main feature almost put me to sleep in spots. I sincerely hope that the next DVD venture Jeff Dunham does will have more fresh material in it (maybe even a new character or new pairings of his old characters). However, it was good to see Bubba J back instead of Melvin the Super""z""ero!"
5,Jeff Dunham works his magic again,Jeff new DVD continues the adventures of his little guys. His is a comedy genius!
4,JEFF DUNHAM,WELL I HAVE ALWAYS LIKED HIM I WATCH MOST OF HIS SHOW OVER & OVER AGAIN I LIKE TO OWN ALL OF HIS CD ONE OF THESE DAYS
5,Jeff Dunham's Very Special Christmas Special,Thanks for having this product so handy on the internet. I enjoy the ease of ordering online and easy payment arrangements
1,A disappointment,"We ordered several for family Christmas gifts but after reviewing we returned all but the one we opened as they are not ""family friendly"". We found it offensive and were quite disappointed as we have always supported Jeff and always go to his shows when he is in town. Not much about Christmas either...trying to be politically correct, I guess. Be sure to review yourself before you give to others!"
1,NOT for the family AT ALL,"My oldest daughter's fiance' introduced Jeff Denham to my family. She asked for his DVDs for her birthday. After watching several excerpts, I refused because of his language. When I saw this DVD advertised as being for the whole family, I thought I'd give it a chance. What false advertisement that was (Or is that really what families today like?). We turned it off after the first 5 minutes. If I could give it 0 stars, I would. If you want good clean humor, go with Aaron Wilburn."
1,Completely Prejudiced and Racist,"The man is completely prejudiced with race, ethnic background, and sexual orientation. There's NO comedy here. Enough said."
3,Not-so-special Chrsitmas Special,This was not as funny as his earlier show. I was amused but not laughing out loud as I expected. Disappointing...
4,Great Comedy Special,I originally watched this on comedy central and it did not seem as good as it was once I got the dvd. Comedy Central cut out a lot of good stuff to show it on television. I highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of his or the people wondering what it is all about.
3,Not Family Friendly,I really like Jeff Dunham's humor but the Christmas Special is not for watching with little kids. I wouldn't even let my 13 year old watch it. The humor is very sexual. I thought his Comedy Central shows were funnier.
4,Amazingly funny!,"As always, Jeff is amazing the way he can interact with the puppets and speak for them, even through his own laughter! Can't wait for his next project. Hopefully it will be filled with lots of new amazing ideas and stories!"
2,Why is this one sensored?,"I love all of Jeff's tapes, but Why is this one sensored? All his other DVD's you have a choice, this one you don't. I just like having the original copy, not a sensored copy. Did I purchase the wrong one?"
2,jeff dunham christmas special,the only thing I didn't like about it is that it is a edited version. and it doesn't say it is on the label
2,Disappointed,"I bought this DVD for my husband for Christmas; we watched it last night and were very disappointed with the fact that every swear word is bleeped out. I didn't buy a DVD to watch in the privacy of our own home to hear ""bleeps"". They should have listed this as two choices: one unedited version and one edited version so I had a choice. I wish I could send it back; we won't watch it again."
1,Very UNSpecial Christmas Special,"The first two DVDs were hilarious. I laughed constantly, until I had tears in my eyes. I am one of his biggest fans, but I have to say this one was very disappointing. I barely managed a chuckle during the whole thing. There was nothing new. He used so much of the same material. Seriously, don't waste your money."
3,Jeff dunhams extra special christmas special,"It's not the uncensored one and does not have all the special features that my friends copy does, most notably the bloopers. I believe it said in the description that it was the uncensored edition and that it did have the bloopers."
5,I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF JEFF!!!!,I have all of Jeff's DVDs and I just can't get enough. I have watched all of his DVDs multiple time (talking 2-digits) and still ROFL everytime!!!
3,good but what's with the BEEPS???,"The show itself is amazing, however, I must have got the under 13 version because every time a bad word was said all I hear is BEEP! I think I am old enough to buy the uncensored version!"
3,"not his best, but not the worst","I first saw the edited version on TV, and was a little disappointed. My brother got to see this performed live, and he told me there was a lot left out of the TV special. So I bought the dvd, and he was right, there was a lot left out. I was much more satisfied with this than the one they showed on TV. I'm not really much of a Bubba-J fan, but his skit was pretty good. Achmed was good also, and as always, Peanut!"
5,I can watch it over and over,"I laughed so hard when I first saw this dvd. I laughed just as hard the second and third time. Jeff Dunham is a unique comedian, and it is so fun to watch his inter-action with the dolls."
4,"funny with a capital ""F""","I bought this video as a gift for my boyfriend, who was already a fan. I had not seen any of Jeff's work, and now I am hooked. It was hilarious!!"
1,"Not funny, just annoying","I heard how funny Jeff Dunham was suppose to be but I cannot say that I agree. His characters are boring and just annoying, not funny. The material is extremely weak and his ventriloquism is sub-par. Don't waste any time of your life watching this material."
3,Dunham Christmas Video,"This Jeff Dunham's Christmas Video(DVD) wasn't the best of his work,I've seen...It's ok...I wouldn'trecommend it...But that is my thought..Somebody out there might enjoy it very much..I orderedanother DVD I hope it better.."
1,Too rude!,"Our family was very disappointed with this video. We usually enjoy Jeff Dunham, but the comments about Angelina Jolee made the video too embarrassing to share with family or friends. I wish I had my money back."
5,FAST delivery,I was very impressed at how fast Amazon ships their products to their customers! Thank you for helping to make my shopping easier...I will be visiting Amazon again for sure!
5,MUCH better than the Comedy Central version!,"As usual, Jeff Dun-HAM delivers! But unfortunately, Comedy Central chopped it up so bad to put it on television, I almost gave up on it before seeing the full version. Don't let the TV edition fool you- they cut out the best stuff, and killed the flow of the show. Jeff and the ""5 little guys in boxes"" are wonderful as usual! Buy this, share this- watch it over and over and over....oh wait, that's me! Merry Christmas!"
2,NOT for the entire family,"I also own the other two Jeff Dunham DVDs and loved them. But this one is promoted ""as fun for the entire family"". Trust me, you wouldn't want to gather around the TV with the kids and watch this one. I didn't know there were so many names for a woman's breasts. And there were so many references to drugs and drug use that it got boring, especially when directed at ""Guitar Man"". Even Peanut, who is my favorite, came off as mean. Usually he is the cute one with a bit of edge. But this time he wasn't cute or funny. I think Dunham wanted to have a Christmas special but just didn't have the material and went ahead anyway."
2,Disappointed,"I love Jeff Dunham and think he is great! This DVD, however, leaves a lot to be desired. Makes one think he was under the influence when this DVD was taped. I hope he gets back to being a great performer soon because I miss the old Jeff. Sorry guitar guy, you don't add anything to the show but distraction from Jeff and ""the guys"". Take a hike!"
1,More theological jargon,This book is just more of the same theological jargon of the Episcopal church. No substance or meat. This is the view of our entire women's study group. Don't waste your time.
2,several inconsistancies,"I too, like a previous reviewer, noticed several errors in the self testing section of this book. Luckily I knew the correct answers and could spot them."
3,minnow bucket,"Nice way to bring minnows on the stream; improvement over the old fashioned cans. But it doesn't always drop one at a time, and can be tricky to get it to work at all. still, it's worth the slight additional cost, and when i use live bait (seldom), i take this along."
4,"An imaginative, well written fantasy.","I didn't know quite what to expect when I opened the book and started reading about a burning rainstorm of jade. Further reading, however, produced excellent character development and an understanding of the inner conflicts of heroine Kesira Minette. The addition of the half wolf half man Molimo to the adventure added to the mystery and suspense. Rouvin, however, was a bit over-exaggerated in character, even allowing for his half-demon heritage. I can't say I was completely disappointed to see him taken out of the picture three-quarters of the way through the book. Still, the way Kesira grows tougher as the story progresses (although she never comes close to being Xena) was entertaining in itself. All in all, a read good enough to make me want to buy the sequels, although from reading this first book of the series makes it pretty obvious what the other three will be about."
2,Not a good technical dictionary,"I purchased this dictionary some years ago, hoping it would have terms some of my other English-Spanish technical dictionaries do not have. It however had very little or none to contribute. I truly think that Publishers, of this type of literature should be more responsible about the books they publish; not just for selling. New books should make a significant contribution. I am now wondering if I should pursue the purchasing of a new technical dictionary from Amazon; since they are both published by Routledge and Keagan Paul Ltd."
2,Poor mixing,"Poor mixing somes up this otherwise good DVD. I was curious if Vernon Reid was actually turned on at one stage. Yes I know it was Jack Bruce's gig, but hey don't all the musicians deserve some recognition. Vernon was cooking, it was a shame though I couldn't hear him. This guy rocks.If you want some live Jack Bruce material, get the Birthday Concert on CD. Well recommended."
1,Space limitations,This item will only work if you have plenty of room from the end of the shower arm to the wall. I have purchased and returned this item because the only way for it to go on properly would have required replacing and therefore lowering the shower arm.
1,Where did the water go?,"The filter worked ok the first few days of use. It definitely effected the water pressure, but not too terrible. After 2-3 days, the water slowed to a drip. Don't waste your money, it's definitely not worth it."
1,It sucks.,"Living in an area where the city puts so much chlorine in the water that you have to practically buy body lotion in bulk makes a showerhead-mounted water filter a good idea. However, this one in particular sucks. Within the first week the cartridge inside swelled up and clogged from the use of hot water, and reduced the outflow of water to a mere drizzle. I have to routinely take the shower filter off, take the cartridge out and rinse it out with cool water every 3 days so it will work. And the unit is only a month old. Pathetic. It's less trouble just to return it and use more lotion."
3,A good fitness product if you know what you're doing,"If you know how to exercise and you're putting together a home exercise program for yourself, these are good to have on hand. The price is certainly right, and you get all kinds of potential exercises. You can work your back and arms, your legs, even your abs, no problem.But, if you don't have a pretty well developed sense of what's a good exercise program for you, these bands are going to be little more than toys. Even though I know enough to use most of these well to get a workout, the red band with the ridged hard part on it mystifies me a little. I use it for rows."
1,saltwater fly casting- lefty kreh,"since this book was inexpensive, i bought it hoping that i might glean a few tips from the master, even though i had read a negative review about this book already. save your money! this book (unfortunately) seems to be like a lot of things lefty is putting his name on these days- just a mish-mash, rehash of better days."
5,Fluorescent Light Fixture,The light arrived as described in the writeup. The fixture was easy to install and works great. I would recommend this to anyone looking for this type of lighting fixture.
5,My favorite shoe,"Very supportive, they work well for me. I've got rheumatoid arthritis and the support I need is found in these shoes."
3,They fit a little tight in the toe..,"The toe box fit me a little smaller than I would have liked. I can't see myself moving around in these shoes for long as a nursing student because it puts too much pressure on my toes when I walk in them. If they offered half sizes I would have ordered a 10 1/2, instead of a 10."
2,wouldn't order again,"These shoes are great for shock obsortion,but lack alot in fit.My right foot is perfect,but my left shoe leans in the minute I put them on.I've tried to keep the weight of my foot on the other side while I am walking,but it doesn't help.I have worn them outside or I would send them back."
2,Not crazy about these!,"The last pair I ordered were in white, and they were much more comfortable than the ones I ordered in black. I have only worn these a couple of times, just to make sure that I didn't miss something. Will not be ordering these again!"
4,Okay,"Recently I gained more weight than I realized and my feet got bigger, that means trying to be in acceptance I have to go up another size,already had big FEET. From what I'm seeing I probably only needed a half size bigger. but it's hard to find sneakers or shoes higher than 10. So when I saw these sneakers in an 11W I ordered them, beause I know the qualiy of Sketchers cause I had ordered a pair before from Amazon."
5,woman's sketchers sneakers,Very happy with my sketchers sneakers. The fit was perfect. The service was great.
5,Awesome,This is my 5th pair of these sneakers. I buy new ones ever year. They hold up great and are so comfortable.
1,to tight,"I received these and just had to send them back, they were to tight. I've never had issues with a shoe feeling tight. I have a regular foot, not wide or anything and have had shoes that fit snuggle, but could still wiggle my toes, these were just squeezing my foot and no room at all. Was very dissapointed."
5,So comfortable!,"I had an accident that changed the way I walk and also causes alot of pain, swelling and soreness in my ankle joint. I'm on my feet alot at work and always busy on weekends, so I needed a shoe that would provide the comfort & flexibility that I need. I tried several other brands but they were stiff and hard with little cushioning. Skechers Women's Energy Jogger's are wonderful...so much cushioning in the sole and the leather is soft and flexible while giving support in the heel area. If I have anything bad to say about them, its that they do stretch some after alot of wear. I get the W width due to swelling, but after a couple of months they get a little too wide and have to adjust the strings. Overall, the most comfy shoes I've ever bought!"
3,Not bad,The make of this shoe is good. The look is fine to. They are a little heavy feeling to the wear though.
5,Shoes....yep,These shoes are great for working out and simply going to work. Plenty of room in the toe area. No squashed toes!
5,excellent Shoes,"These shoes are very comfy I just love them and will be ordering more in the future. But I like sketchers anyway,"
4,Decent Espresso machine,"For a low end machine it seems to work very well. The big drawback with a machine like this is that you have to time frothing and brewing very carefully. Would certainly be much better with a switch to move steam from brewing to frothing, but I guess what do you expect for [money amount]on christmas special. In any case, I use mine 7 days a week for lates and have had no problems for the last 7 months. Rubber o-ring pressure seals are much better than more expensive ""cheap"" models I've used. I'm still looking for a better maker but after reading reviews it seems even the expensive models blow pressure seals and heating elements. This works."
1,fire hazard here,"You have to watch this appliance carefully or it will melt and likely catch fire. The first time I tried it out I ran water through it with no coffee, as suggested in the manual to get rid of ""any new smell."" I did not switch the unit off and after about 5 minutes it had started smoking profusely and the plastic was severely melted on the vertical front surface (presumably in front of the heater coil).The manual does say to turn it off when done brewing, but it neglects to mention what will happen if you don't!This is a dangerous design; it's an accident waiting to happen. Sooner or later you will get distracted by the kids, dog, phone or whatever, then watch out!"
2,Pretty ghastly,"When I heard that Pike would be appearing in this Buffy novel, I was excited. But then, I was shocked at how poorly Christipher Golden wrote his character. Pike went from a street wise mechanic with an alcohol problem to a taxi driving beach bum who, despite his superior fighting skills, has given up the good fight to simply ignore it. HORRIBLE characterization of Pike. When I think of Pike, I choose to omit this novel. If I could, I would unread this book. I love Christopher Golden and Pike, but this book is an accurate representation of neither."
3,"This is a good story, but not one of the best BTVS books..","""Sins Of the Father"" tries to do too much in too little space. The initial plot line of Buffy and Pike versus a stone demon was interesting, and a change from the typical vampire stories. However, we then get handed a couple of subplots that don't mesh well with the main story. Giles' confrontation with a ""vampire"" who appears to be his father might have been better handled as a separate book. And the ""personal"" elements--Angel/Buffy dealing with an old boyfriend showing up, Giles' issues with his father and his destiny as a Watcher, are familiar territory already. All in all, I'd give it between two and three stars."
4,This should be a script for a NEW Buffy movie,"This book was very well written. It was good to see that Christopher Golden brought parts of the original movie into the book. A face from Buffy's past enters back into Buffy's life unexpectedly. Her old flame from Los Angles. Pike( who was played by Luke Perry in the movie). This puts Buffy's love life into a spin when she has to decide which man she loves most, Angel or Pike. Pike's coming to Sunnydale was not personal, he needed Buffy's help to destroy a Stone Demon that he got really mad. All this and the usual magick from Willow, quiet coolness from Oz, fighting between Xander and Cordy, and the usual British remarks from Giles makes for some really good reading."
4,Not Digable but definitely Diggin it. . . .,I bought this album (knowing buttalfy was the soloist)hoping to hear no remnants of Digable Planets. Don't get me wrong Digable's were (are) the joint--one of the most innovative groups in any music genre-- but that was close to 10 years ago and I like to see the growth/change/evolution of an artist and buttafly has done that. What I like about Bright Black is that it shows a little attitude and some edge. Its street but unearthly. Definitely in its own category. The discerning ear will appreciate this piece of music artwork.
3,The real talent behind Cherrywine.,"The real talent behind Cherrywine is Thaddeus Turner, the guitarist, who also plays in a great Seattle band called Maktub. Check out Khronos, especially the explicit lyrics edition if you can still find it. I much better band altogether, in my opinion, but then again I don't dig on Ishmael's lyrics all that much."
5,try it for yourself,"I read the reviews, some unfavorable, and still bought the book. I thought it was a good story. The hero was complex, not evil, and human. The heroine was likeable, brave, and kind. The scene in the middle of the book many people complain about was fine, it was believable and tragic. The recovery, I think, was realistic while still good fiction. The writing was excellent and the story kept me on the edge of my seat and turning pages till the very end."
4,Great Music Discovery,"I found this to be a pleasant suprise. I stumbled upon Lee Morgan while looking for ""The Sidewinder"". It was playing on an episode of Magic City and I remembered it from my childhood. But I had no ideal who the artist was. Now I am very glad I found him."
4,window guards,"Peace of mind!! Our daughter has autism and recently figured out the window stops we were using on our second floor windows. These guards were VERY easy to install, arrived quickly with standard shipping and have allowed us to sleep again. The only down side was the guard wasn't quite tall enough for our windows. To prevent her from squeezing her head under or over the top we used two guards one on top of the other."
2,a good video,"This video is a very good video for children under 7. Join Artur,Francine,Buster and the brain in a great video. When Artur's friends find some treasure in their back garden he decides to look in his garden.By Max Plackowski"
5,SWEETEST little light. EVER,"I've been carrying an Arc AAA around for a good two years now. It's the brightest single ""AAA"" light on the market and YEARS ahead of the infamous Maglite Solitaire. With this LED light theres no more broken bulbs, and pitiful output. The runtime is a good 6 hours with VERY minimal dimming (due to its boost circut) The best thing is the batteries are ALOT easier to find than those expensive lithium coin cells that other keychain lights use. Buy it now! I still have no idea how I lived without one!"
4,Quick Course in Mictrosoft Excell 2000,The book presents the information in a very clear and helpful format. The book was for another person so I have not used the text myself. The receiver was grateful and excited about receiving the book.
3,Quality Optic At A Great Price,I purchased this scope for use on an AR carbine. Optical quality is quite good at all magnifications and eye relief is decently long.I also purchased a Nikon M223 mount which places this scope perfectly with regard to height and eye relief with the M4 style stock.The Fullfield line from Burris is no longer U.S. made but at the sale price of $140 it was hard to pass up.The only downside is that the ocular rotates when you change magnification so the use of a flip up scope cap is problematic. I understand that the latest Fullfield line has rectified this problem.I've not used this product long or hard enough to swear to it's reliability but I've been well served by other Burris scopes so I'm anticipating no problems.
4,Exercise Workbook for Beginning AutoCad 2005,"If you are beginner or even you don't know anything about AutoCad (like me), you don't need any other book excep;Exercise Workbook for beginning AutoCad 2005 by Cheryl R. Shrockor AutoCad 2005AutoCadLt 2005 No experience required,by Daivd Frey.( You don't need both books ).One off this book will do the job.Both books Are excellent. They gide you step by step from begining to the end.You can't faunded better book.Thanks to David & Cheryl. Thank you K."
5,Great straight thoughts about the bi-cultural experience,"In Something to Declare Julia Alvarez give us rich insights into the process of being a writer and living the full but difficult life of a bi-cultural citizen. Her book helped me a lot to understand my dual citizenship, but also it helped me to deal with the voices that fill my mind in at least two languages. A must for anyone who enjoys ethnic literature, or emmigrant fiction."
4,Very satisfied with the product,"The material provides the comfort you expect from flannel, and the design puts a smile on your face without being silly. I have bought more substantial cotton flannel but at about three times the price."
3,Delightful,This is a very entertaining read for a leisure geared break. Deborah Hale is delightful with her weaves of fantasy and achieves the art of taking me to another time and place where I can lose myself in the joys of fairy tale endings. Keep up the good work.
2,Boring and the Blah,"Sorry, but this is my last attempt with this author. I've tried several times but she just doesn't do it for me. This is a shallow story, much contrived with characters that neither engage nor entertain. The beauty and the beast story and its variations can be extremely entertaining and there are countless examples in romantic and, particularly, regency fiction - too countless to name here. Any of the romantic review sites will give you long lists in this sub-genre. This one, however was just simply credulous. Angela Lacewood never aroused any sympathy in me and Lucius (and boy did the author make a mull of his title - it was given in several ways and usually wrongly) was too ill-drawn to make me at all attracted to him (a ""must"" with romantic fiction!). The story was not particularly well thought out and sadly, I admit I skimmed the last quarter of this in an effort to justify the expense of purchasing it."
1,.,The writing came off as if the author was shaking you and insisting you feel sexual tension and romance; but you inevitably just get a headache.
3,"A good story, but not a keeper","If I could, I would give this novel 3 1/2 stars. It's not as bad as the one-star reviewer would have you believe, but in my opinion, it's not as good as the 4 & 5 stars would say. I love some of the characters -- Angela is a fine heroine; the old grandfather; Tibby the housekeeper. Lucius was a difficult hero to admire; I have to sort of agree with the one-star reviewer about his mask, but the author made me understand the paranoia about his scarred face that was behind his wearing it. The book just fell flat somewhere for me. I thought the book went on too long, that's it; some nonsense about Lucius trying to get Angela to love the vicar instead was just that: nonsense. So I have to give it a solid 3 1/2 stars for the mostly well-plotted writing, & some characterizations, but in the end, it's not a keeper for me."
4,Love,Again Deborah Hale is a great writer and we love her detail in her stories. We will be reading all of her works
1,SE AG10 Batteries (Pkg. of 10),These batteries were useless. They didn't last 20 minutes in a small hand held calculator.The previous battery bought from Radio Shack had been used for over 3 years. I tried one in a second calculator and it didn't work at all. I won't buy from this source again.
1,watch out for the S&H trick,"I am also appaled by the prices of AG10. However, do not fall into the old trick of sellers as one of the reviewers did. Indeed some sell through Amazon for 1 cent per battery, but it is plus 4.99 shipping and handling!"
5,Best Collection I've Read in A Long Time,"This book left me shell-shocked. The writing is so good, the characters so well-drawn . . . really, I am at a loss as to what to say. I read the whole collection in one night. I had read ""Rose"" earlier, in another collection, and upon re-reading it I was still shocked and moved! I was also moved by ""Deaths At Sea"". Great stuff all around. Like the previous reviewer, I wish Dubus was still with us to write more stories like these. I do not like to give 5 stars out very freely, and when I love a book I usually give it 4. But this one was different."
3,The Last Worthless Evening,This book contained four novellas and two short stories. Most of the stories were rather depressing and not what I was in the mood to read.
2,Half Toasted,"I bought this toaster after reading several reviews, finding a reasonable price, and liking the look of it. I was looking to upgrade since my old toaster (a toastmaster) was cranked to the highest setting and needed to go through two toast cycles to lightly brown. I am seriously disappointed with this toaster. I put my english muffin in and only half the muffin toasts, and that half usually ends up burnt. The slots are slanted forward, and it seems that when the muffin is in the toaster, it is the upper portion that over toasts, and the lower portion comes out essentially raw. Though my toastmaster was only 6 years old or so, and had to go through two cycles....it still toasted better then this T-Fal. I bought it several weeks ago and have only used it a handful of times, I am going to try to clean it up good and return it for some other brand.Hope this helps."
1,T-Fal is T-Bad,"I decided to ""upgrade"" and spend more on a toaster, too. First one did not work properly - one of the wires that holds the toast in didn't move with the lever and the toast tilted to one side and burned. My second one - the wires work but it does not toast evenly at all! Half the time portions are burned, even at a lower setting of 3-4. I don't see it being a whole lot faster, either. I've gone through a half/loaf of bread testing it and I am not happy. I appreciate the reviews on Amazon and checked here to see the comments on this product. It looks like the two good reviews were from a year ago, so perhaps the manufacturing has gotten sloppy. But my old, cheap, unattractive toaster does a better job than this! Do I exchange it again or forget it?!"
4,Evenly browned toast on both sides!!!,"This is the best toaster I've ever had. The toast always comes out evenly browned on both sides, even after toasting multiple slices. The cool touch sides are very nice for those with children. The bread lifter works very well.The slots are wide enough for bagels and the toaster never burns them. However, if you buy specialty bread that is longer than a normal slice of the typical square bread you will have to trim it before toasting. The slots are wide, but short.The only complaint I have is that you have to give the lever an extra hard push at the bottom when inserting toast or the toaster won't start toasting. The toaster also takes up more counter space than a typical 2 slice toaster."
1,Bad toaster,"This toaster lasted for about 8 months before it started to burn toast on one side, even at low settings. We are very disappointed with this purchase."
1,"Bread toasts well but, bagels and muffins are bad","Based on all the glowing reviews here of this toaster, I went and purchased one. It does toast bread just fine. But it is absolutely lousy on bagels and english muffins. One half of the same side too dark and the other half of the same side not toasted at all. Figured that I had a bad one. Exchanged it for another and it does the same thing. I am very puzzled HOW it can do so poorly on round items, but it does. Tried inside in, inside out. Always the half closest to back of toaster burns before the half closest to the front gets any gold at all."
1,looks CAN be deceiving,"What a beautiful hunk of toaster. But alas, all style, no functionality. First the lever which helps lift up the bread stripped its gears (approximately 3 months into use), then the inside heating elements ceased to function (4 months into use), and finally we tossed the unit when it began to smell like burning wires.Incredibly disappointed with T-Fal service - they do not stand behind this product."
1,Another Defective Product,"Another defective product - didn't work from the start. I have no patience for awful quality control with today's products (or is it just my bad luck). Plus, the returns are so difficult since the stores make you feel like a criminal. You might want to try this before you leave the store."
1,Do Not Buy This Toaster,"This toaster projectile ejects your toast right to the kitchen floor, even if the toaster is located at the back of the counter by the wall. I can not vouch for the toast--we never got to sample any as they all were hurled to the floor. ""Avante"" toaster--should be called the ""Avalanche"" toaster--that's what you get."
5,Keeps hair in good condition,"I've used different products for straightening my hair along with a ceramic iron, and have achieved the best results with the Chi product line. I apply the Thermal Protective Treatment after shampooing and after the rinse my hair is smooth and silky."
5,Great Griddle!!,I am very happy with it....worth every penny! Heavy. The handle gets hot after a while though. So super smooth. I would purchase Calphalon again in a heartbeat! I always put it in the dishwasher...the cooking surface and handle are still brand new looking...but the underside went yucky (I knew that would happen...anything not to wash dishes!)
2,"Handle gets very hot, and the notstick coating is peeling of","...I bought this pan a few weeks back. With the first use, ,I was very surprised to notice that the handle of the pan gets very hot, likely due to the absence of the branched origin of the handle. I have several other high end cookware, and none of their handle gets hot like this (and all of them have a branched origin of the handles).Other than that, , the pan is very good. I would have given it 5 stars, , but I think the hot handle should take it down by 2 stars. I am very surprised that none of the other reviewers has mentioned this.This part is a follow up on the review I have done a while back. I decided to lower one more star because now the non-stick coating on the pan is peeling off, making the food stick. This is despite using wooden or plastic utensils only and handwashing it."
4,Incompetent cook likes this competent griddle,"Ah, the downside of divorce...well, at least I'm finally learning to cook, slowly and painfully. And even I can tell the difference between this griddle and the thinner aluminum pans I own. Much, much more even cooking, and I like the fact that the heat is retained for so long. Helps even out some of the high-low mistakes I make adjusting the flame. I've only used it for pancakes so far, and I used an aerosol spray of canola oil each time prior to cooking, but the pancakes have been perfect, and cleanup was a breeze."
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"I HAVE OTHER CALPHON THAT I VERY HAPPY WITH,BEWARE OF THIS ONE.EVERY PIECE OF MEAT OR CHICKEN OR EGGS STICKS TO IT,NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO,AND THE CLEAN UP TAKES TIME AND A GOOD DEAL OF WORK."
5,Must Have Griddle!,"I hesitated on buying this griddle at first thinking it was too small, but it's absolutely perfect. I use it any chance I get. This was my first Calphalon purchase and it won't be my last. Easy to use, easy to wash, great price - what else can you ask for?"
2,Awkward & Handle gets HOT!,"This griddle cooks well. However, it is awkward to hold and move due to the long thin solid metal handle supporting the heavy pan.However, the real difficulty is that the handle gets almost to the pan temperature. It also stays hot for a longer time than the pan probably due to the different metal in the handle. This presents an additional surface for small children to touch.I got this for my wife, and she bought their everyday round griddle for me. The round griddle is better balanced, and the handle looks to be improved. On the other hand, the non-stick looks different. It also isn't as heavy so it may not conduct heat quite as well and, therefore, not cook quite as well.However, we'll trade some perfection for a better balance of virtues."
3,Handle gets very hot,"This is the first time I am writing a review though I routenely buy things from Amazon.[com]I bought this pan a few weeks back. With the first use, ,I was very surprised to notice that the handle of the pan gets very hot, likely due to the absence of the branched origin of the handle. I have several other high end cookware, and none of their handle gets hot like this (and all of them have a branched origin of the handles).Other than that, , the pan is very good. I would have given it 5 stars, , but I think the hot handle should take it down by 2 stars. I am very surprised that none of the other reviewers has mentioned this."
2,Too Hot to Handle,"The quality of the griddle itself is great; however, the metal handle becomes extremely hot after just a small time, and regardless of heat setting. ALWAYS have a pot holder handy before working with this piece of cookware. Also, it takes a long time to cool unless you run it under cold water after use. I would not recommend this product to people with small children who might want to grab the nice shiny - and scalding - handle."
3,"Good story, bad printing","The story itself is good, but the 2009 Pyr printing is full of typos. Nothing pulls me out of a fantasy world quicker than a typo.I wonder if the other editions suffer the same problem?"
4,Desolation Road Mass Market Paperback,"Desolation RoadI could not wait to read this book, so I read the massmarket paperback from an out of town library. The story is certianly enjoyable. But the COVER of this new edition with a picture of an atomic engine created by Stephan Martiniere's exceptional artwork getting ready to roll across Mars captured my fancy. I keep an advertisment for the new cover in our bookstore. I chuckle repeatedly knowing the town was named Desolation Road due to an alcoholic malapropism that stuck after the founder's celebration of his good fortune."
2,Couldn't get interested,"I read a lot of books and I read a lot of sci/fi. This book couldn't capture my attention after 100 pages, so I quit reading it. Sorry."
4,Works as advertised,"We bought two of these snorkels for use in Hawaii, and they both work. This is NOT a 100% dry snorkel, which probably cannot be found in this price range. A dry snorkel only means it can prevent splash water. I do not understand what the flap on the top of the snorkel is for, since it does not close up underwater and makes inhaling air harder (only two small holes on top of the flap; the flap is closed during breathing). Otherwise this snorkel is fine. The royal color is the picture shown of this product. We also got the silver version."
4,Dry Snorkel,"I tried this out once so far. It doesn't allow any water in while swimming laps. It is worn to the left side. I am able to swim without interference from this snorkel. The goggle attachment is stuck to the snorkel, unlike my previous snorkel that was removable. Comes in a nice bag.The mouthpiece seems thin compared to my old one. I ended chewing through my previous snorkel. This is my cause for dropping it one star."
4,Fair Snorkel For A Fair Price,"If you have never used a ""dry"" snorkel, it is merely a standard snorkel with a flap at the end of the tube to keep most water from entering if you get the end underwater. This one does that job well enough. I doubt any of them is 100%, but you don't really need to prevent every drop from getting in.The appointments of a snorkel are pretty standard, and this one has the usual. Pretty good for the price."
1,"not very good,","bland, and boring... thick crust.My daughter wouldn't eat the fish at all due to the trout's skin which has a slimy consistency.The fish had no flavor and no texture. The crust is like a big, thick blanket of a pre- processed mashed up casing, not a traditional bread crumb / with cheese topping. It has no texture and the flavor is lacking."
2,Nothing Special,"I bought this book because I love the movie Fletch, and I heard that Kevin Smith plans on making this book into a new Fletch film.My problem with this book is that it is all dialouge. This is more of a screenplay than a novel. The writing is very boring, completely undescriptive.The story is at times amuzing and may make a funny movie, but it is not a good novel. My advice would be wait for the movie."
2,Slightly engaging,"2 1/2An album not without it's intriguing art-rock textures, but eventually ends up sounding washed up in ambient haze without too much songwriting backbone to justify the lengthy indulgences."
3,I don't get it,"Having been a long time fan of Talk Talk, and having read the glowing reviews, I figured I'd take a chance on this CD. While the CD may have, at one time, been considered groundbreaking that ground has long been lost. Don't get me wrong, it's a pleasant enough. So so production and recording and a fairly fixed formula just don't do it for me. I was expecting great things from this CD and it just hasn't delivered."
2,sounds okay,I thought the music sounded great on my home theater setup. I just couldn't deal with the vocals - this guy can't sing. I'd be interested to hear what these guys are up to now... and if they got a different singer.
1,poor workmanship.,"The slippers are very cute,warm,and just what I expected.I didn't expect them to have seams rip out after only 2 days of wear."
2,Scratchy front seam,"The front seams on these pants are scratchy, especially on the knees. The seams don't drape well, so the pants hang funny. I returned them. I have other Under Armour pants that fit well and feel great--but these definitely didn't. The Gear Tech fabric keeps you cool, washes and hangs dry in a few hours--so I give the product two stars for the quality of the material."
4,One of the best....,"That's right I said it. It is without a doubt the best album put out since ""Some Girls"". While it doesn't have the same impact as the albums of the 70s, it has such a great sense of energy and yet maturity to it. Loads of great singles(the two songs with Keith's lead vocals are great). It's funny cause since their albums of the 80s, I was quick to dismiss them as beyond their time. However, this album was quite a surprise and an excellent listen. Trust me, you will not be disappointed."
1,absolute trash!,"I will never purchase a new Stones album again....It's no secret that thru Exile they were truly great, but from Goat's Head Soup on they were just another pretty good band who did everything blatantly for money..huge stadiums..all the mystery gone.all an act...when I was 10 years old the Stones scared me..now they are like Wayne Newton...New Faces is the only intriguing new song here.."
1,It's All Been Done Before,"This Stones record is a repeat of the previous six or seven. No original ideas, bad singing, lousy guitar playing, same four chords on the guitar. Only Keith's ""The Worst"" rates high in my book."
4,A return to form,"VOODOO LOUNGE, is a very good album from the Greatest Rock 'n' Roll Band in the World. On this album, the band has returned to a musical style that helped them become great all those years ago. We have rockin' songs on here such as: LOVE IS STRONG, YOU GOT ME ROCKING, SPARKS WILL FLY. We also have a good a few good ballads: OUT OF TEARS, MOON IS UP, NEW FACES. I also think that the two songs that Keith has lead vocals on, THE WORST, THRU AND THRU, are most definately some of the best tracks on this album. This album was what alot of die-hard Stones fans have been waiting awhile for. The Stones return to their roots."
2,Very Ordinary.,"For a start, why so many tracks - 15? Cut out 5 of the worst songs and you might be left with a reasonable album (at best).But look for a handful of quality songs and you still won't be left with more than a couple. Maybe Love Is Strong and ... can't really find any others. Basically this is an album of fillers looking for some strong songs to hold it together.Too many crappy ballads. Not enough grunt.Give it a miss unless you're obsessive about having a complete collection."
3,Mixed Voodoo,"Voodoo Lounge is a workman like effort by The Stones. The album contains some good material, but much of the time they come off as just punching the clock. ""Love Is Strong"", ""Sparks Will Fly"", ""I Go Wild"", ""Suck On The Jugular"" & ""Blinded By The Rainbows"" all stand out. A very good record, just not a great one."
3,"nice sound, lousy songwriting","I want so much to like this record. Keith brings in Don Was to produce a record that will feature elemental, classic Stones sounds. Can't miss. But Keith didn't write any good songs for this record! Maybe he cleaned out the closet for ""Main Offender"". So it's up to Jagger, who evidently was not thrilled with the choice of producer. And Jagger hits a few line drives, ""Moon is Up"", ""Sparks Will Fly"" (too vulgar, though), ""Mean Disposition"", and ""Out of Tears"". Despite the usual professionalism there's just too many warmed over riffs on this disk to give it a great grade. And when, oh when, will these guys ever grow up?"
3,An Average Album,"Sure, they have done it before but who cares. They have brought the world so much great music that they are entitled to make mistakes. My biggest problem with Voodoo Lounge is something Mick pointed out not so long ago--Don Was was going for an Exile revisited and that just doesn't work. It's a hodge-podge of styles. Fans complain about not liking the new stuff and loving the old stuff. Well, they can't go back. They have grown up and their music has too. Just love the Stones for who they are. ""Blinded by Rainbows"" is a classic."
2,Put It Out And See If It'll Sell,"Another in the long line of Stones CD's which attempt to evoke the imagery of the early albums but doesn't. Not quite their worst, to be sure, but they are not aging gracefully, either."
3,One great song,"This highly touted album was generally favorably reviewed by the critics, but it's mostly fluff and lousy songs. There is also more gratiutous vulgarity here than on any other Stones album. Yeah, they've made a career out of being grungy and vulgar, but one gets the sense Mick just threw this in to appeal to the younger set. The middle songs here are all wastes, the instrumentals are fine, but Mick sounds forced and bored.The single from Voodoo Lounge is the droning ""Love is Strong,"" which is saved only by a strong bridge, the rest of the song is vapid and tired-sounding. However, the one strong suit here is a great Stones rocker in their old style, ""You Got Me Rocking,"" which is by far their best cut since ""Start Me Up."" A fine song, sung with punch and verve by Mick. This song alone is worth buying the album, but you probably won't listen to the other tracks more than once."
2,Another boring cd from a boring band !,"I have tried to listen to the Rolling Stones many times but the result is always the same, I just don't like their music. I don't understand why they are so big with so limited talent. Mick Jagger is not a signer, this band should consider themself very lucky to have been in the fisrt band in the history of Rock'n'Roll because I am sure they would never have such success if their career started in the 70's when there were many more bands to choose from."
2,THE ROLLING STONES! GATHERING MOSS!,"My number one favorite rock&roll band of all time,so more power to 'em! There are a couple ok songs. But over all ""boring!,boring!,boring! I don't want them to live in the past. Lets just hope this isn't a look into the future. ""IF YOU CAN'T ROCK ME!(SOMEBODY WILL!)"
1,Wrong CD,"Arrived just in time for Christmas, but got sent, if you can believe this, Tour de France Soundtracks. Will never use again!"
3,Half of it is great!,"It's a funny thing but the recent purely studio Stones albums tend to start off with a variety of hits and misses and end up with their best stuff. Not good for reviews, first impressions, and in-store listening - basically helping to sell the album. ""Love Is Strong"", ""The Worst"", ""New Faces"", ""Out Of Tears"", ""I Go Wild"" and the albums's last 4 tracks stand out. ""Thru And Thru"" is either a masterpiece or drunken indulgence depending on who you believe. Well it closed out season 2 of The Sopranos. Masterpiece! The surrounding songs rock and ""Blinded By Rainbows"" is pretty much as epic as Mick intended it to be. Enjoy it for the songs that are on. The sad part is there are some b-sides from this period that should have been on the album. ""So Young"" from the Some Girls days and ""The Storm"" particularly spring to mind."
3,Really good for what The Stones have done in the past decade,"""Voodoo Lounge"" is a really good album. Of course if you compare it to the Old Stones, it's not good. The Stones will never return to that prime so you might as well forget it. I would give this album higher praise but the album does fall flat after ""I Go Wild"". ""Sparks Will Fly"", ""Moon Is Up"", and ""Out Of Tears"" are definitely the best Stones songs I've heard in a long time. ""Voodoo Lounge"" and ""Stripped"" both display that The Rolling Stones did have their moments in the 90's. So if you have all the classic Stones albums and want to check out some of their recent albums, get ""Voodoo Lounge."""
3,"Hey, Get Some Ears","The Rolling Stones need ears. The unissued outtakes and alternate takes of these cuts are all superior, every one (same is true for ""Steel Wheels""). Mostly it's a matter of Richards' guitar work being mixed way down in favor of Jagger's vocals. Strange and even fascinating odd sonic experiments are mixed down into mush. Either they work on it so hard they don't hear it any more, or Jagger's ego is the trump card on the take choices. Maybe a few decades from now the best takes will be issued and this will be tossed. An OK album as issued; brilliant if the best takes had been chosen, if not on the level of ""Exile"". I hate George Martin's stereo mixes of the Beatles (as opposed to their own mono choices) but it's a crime the Stones didn't have a George Martin in the 70s and 80s. Don Was on ""Stripped"" (an excellent overlooked album) showed what could happen if they did."
4,A Pleasant Surprise,"This release along with Bridges To Babylon are two solid if not spectacular late Stones releases. There are several good hard rock songs(Love Is Strong, You Keep Me Rockin', I Go Wild, Mena Disposition) and many creative elements in other songs that make this recording stand tall. New Faces is nicely complimented by accordion sounds reminiscent of such early Stones pieces like Lady Jane and Backstreet Girl. Suck On The Jugular funks better than some of the guys other excursions into disco. Keith's two numbers are sung with a emotion if not with great technique. In general, nothing is bad on this recording. However, this material is not on the level of the Stones Material between 1968 and 1973."
2,The love is not so strong...,"The song titled 'Love is Strong', is the main reason why I bought the Rolling Stone's Voodoo Lounge album. After I listened to the rest of the album, I was quite dissapointed. I just wished for the days of great Stone's albums like Sticky Fingers or even Some girls to come back. Unfortunately, I think those days are long gone with an album like Voodoo Lounge. If you are a hard core Rolling Stones fan, I would imagine you buying this album. For now, I just wish that the Stones could just pump out one or more great albums that would send the rock and roll fever going through my veins."
1,"sad, sad, sad","If this wasn't the Stones, Voodoo Lounge would be used to back up beer commercials. The candle is out."
3,I can't really decide,"Sometimes I hate this CD. It sounds like a Rolling Stones tribute band.Then sometimes I love it, because it's the Stones doing what they do best. You Got Me Rocking has become a live staple, and is actually a good song. I Go Wild is another great rocker.And the Stones actually took some chances here, on Sweethearts Together, The Moon Is Up, and other tracks that normally wouldn't have found their way onto a vinyl LP; they would have ended up as b-sides.Better than Steel Wheels, not as good as Bridges to Babylon."
4,"Pretty good album.. close to great, but not quite","VOODOO LOUNGE was the Stone's first album in probably 20 years to really usher in a new era in their career. Some Girls was phenominal, but Tattoo You marked their slow decline (although I liked the album). It was a precedent for how bad their albums would get through the decade. (Undercover, Emotional Rescue, Dirty Work). Steel Wheels only alluded to a new era, but Voodoo Lounge finally takes it to the next level.From the beginnin of Love is Strong, there is a unique kind of energy that the Stones never quite had. No doubt, they had unbridled energy through the 60s and 70s, as well as creative peaks. But nothing quite like the calculated powers they undertook with VOODOO LOUNGE. This is just what the Stones needed, and whats more- what the fans needed."
2,OK BUT NOT GREAT,"Surprisingly enough this album was actually a little bit better than most of the garbage that the Stones have been bombarding us with recently. Okay, so its not Exile but its actually more listenable than Steel Wheels or (shudder)Undercover and Emotional Rescue. I actually kind of like love is strong, the worst, and through and through. Odd though that two of the best are by Richards.Anyway, this album is okay but dont expect anything great or original. Theres still the standard rockers about sex,three of which sound the same,and one dumb song which compares a girl to a car(thats really a new idea!)and one awful ballad called Sweethearts Together.Whats annoying about most of the songs is that they are so OBVIOUSLY TRYING to be macho, and they are in a kind of cartoonish and unrealistic way. It seems that back when Mick was androgonous and bisexual the Stones had more of an edge. Now it all seems to just be pretend."
4,As good a musical comeback as they could have done,"When Voodoo Lounge was released in July of 1994, it was apparent that the Stones had stopped resting on their laurels and decided to come up with a good album. The album opens up with ""Love Is Strong"" which features Jagger blowing a mean harp. There are some real modern gems on this album such as ""The Worst"" which features Keith's raspy voice in a country music setting. He never sounded more convincing. ""New Faces"" features beautiful harpsichord passages. ""Out of Tears"" is a good ballad. ""Blinded By Rainbows"", a commentary about violence in Northern Ireland, is very affecting. However, the other songs on the album sound just like what the Stones have done before without really anything new to say. They're not bad, but they're not really compelling."
2,A hex on it,"For the life of me I can't see why people prefer this to Steel Wheels. The songwriting is weak, bordering on lazy; the production by Don Was is bright and shiny MOR, which sucks the life out of the hard rock numbers; and the band performances are good but not exactly hot, although both Mick and Ron Wood are in nice form. Probably my least played Stones album."
3,Voodoo Lounge Is No Lounge Music,"This 1994 album is a very solid and entertaining release from the great Stones. Every track is either really good or pretty good. It's a good album to pop in. The first track ""Love Is Strong"" is one of the better, and most strongest, songs they've released in a while. ""Out Of Tears"" might seem like too much of a Michael Bolton ballad, but it's nice and Mick sings it very nicely. The rockers are all pure Stones gold. ""I Go Wild"", ""You Got Me Rocking"" are the best. Then there's ""Suck On The Jugular"". This is a very funky song with a great catch, both melody wise and chorus wise. Instantly listenable. The only real down side is that there's a few songs on here that are fairly short. Some are two and a half minutes long. Oh well. The Stones would miss with their next release, ""Bridges To Babylon"". This is so much better. By far. Nice job guys!."
1,casio alarm clock,Alarm does not work.. I guess I got what I paid for. I did not realize how small the clock actually was.
5,Love it,I wanted a small travel alarm to replace an old one that had just given out..This was the smallest I could find.The numbers on the face are large enough to see and the alarm is very loud. Even has a light that you can turn on if you need to see in the dark.
2,Hard to see,"Unlike the photo, reading this clock is difficult without overhead light or using the small backlight button. The buttons to set the time/alarm are small and hard to see and I only have mild vision impairment."
5,Great LITTLE alarm.,"This is my second one of these. My first lasted eleven years. It went with me on my many trips to Europe and Asia. Most alarms are too large and consequently take up too much space in your luggage.Price wise, it is relatively expensive. I am pretty sure that the first one was relatively inexpensive. However, sometimes you have to pay more for quality."
3,IT'S OKAY,"Pros: small size makes it very portable (it could comfortably even be a little bigger). Loud ring wakes me up (in contrast to the relative inaudibility of most other travel alarm clocks).Cons: the very small, hard to read, print opposite the small buttons; the fragility of the the stand - it comes apart all the time."
5,"great price, great product","I ordered these because I have an airsoft bb gun, but I wanted to use paintballs. They arrived at a good speed and are a great product. They shoot great with a very few amount of bad balls. Sometimes a few won't pop, but that may be because sometimes I stand close to the target. They come in bottles so they come in perfect condition. They are red and they make a good splat. If you need small paintballs I think this is the way to go."
2,Nothing special...somewhat interesting but no mystery and no intrigue,"I love true crime and this sounded interesting simply because the man was put on trial 4 times for the same murder. But so much of this book is a waste of details about characters who don't have a thing to do with the killing or whether the accused is guilty, and they don't even have any connection to each other or the outcome of the trials, etc. There's no mystery, no intrigue. I think the author was simply filling up enough pages to make it long enough to publish. I kept reading part one thinking it would build up to something exciting in part two and that these characters would all fit together. But in part two, the author writes about the trials, not in any great detail, and mixes in more filler that is simply a waste of time and has nothing to do with anything. It was somewhat enjoyable but for all of those who sing its praises so highly, I have to wonder."
2,Disappointed,"Unfortunately, I was disappointed with this book. I was really looking forward to reading it because of all the positive reviews I had read. The only reason I gave it two stars is for the authors descriptions of Savannah and its residents. The book was very slow moving and there were characters introduced that were extensively discussed in the beginning but never reappeared in the book near the end. I also purchased the City of Falling Angels for my husband and he said the same thing about it. Nice description of the city but definitely not worth recommending to someone."
4,Reads like a novel but lacks suspense.,"I too picked up this book because of the attention it was receiving nationwide. I was drawn by the vivid portrayal of the city and the people but a little disappointed in the actual covering of the crime. Part of this is my fault, I went in expecting a suspenseful, gripping murder mystery to go along with the hype, but what I got was a trial drama. That's a problem with preconceived notions, but not with the book itself. An enjoyable read, especially for non-fiction."
3,Very Well Written But...,"I found the movie more interesting. The book was written like a mystery fiction which I enjoyed. The storyline left me a little empty, but seeing the movie made the book more interesting. Recommend it? Depends on who the person is."
5,"Ohhh, Baby! You Gotta Dig This One!","A South that can nurture such a delightful collection of eccentrics as The Lady Chablis and Luther Driggers can't be all bad. This book is pure summer delight in its range of characters and storytelling.After reading the book, I looked forward to seeing the movie. With the exception of seeing the Lady Herself in action, the movie was one BIG Let Down! Why Clint Eastwood and his screen writers thought they could do better than John Berendt in telling this story is beyond me. There is a reason why this book became a best-seller. Mr. Eastwood should have paid closer attention to the book in his film adaptation. Mr. Berendt's Savannah is a far more honest and satisfying place to be than Mr. Eastwood's celluloid farce."
3,Pure entertainment,"Berendt has given us an absorbing and entertaining book with this. He is a compelling story teller and a confirmed stylist. This is one of those guilty pleasures that everyone should read, even if you might blush if discovered reading anything less than Dostoevsky."
4,Too Much Hype,"MIDNIGHT is the kind of book that takes a while to get into, but once you're in, you stay put. The beginning of this book is slow because it's mostly introduction to characters, the city of Savannah, and how Berendt came to be in Savannah. Plot setup, all in all. But once the murder happens, the plot gets rolling, and the pace becomes faster and faster until it's a roller coaster ride that cannot be stopped. This book takes you on unimaginable twists and turns as you wonder if Jim Williams was a murderer or if it was only self-defense. Not a book to be forgotten for many years, the hype was still too much to hold up to expectations."
2,"The book's overrated, but the title is a ""10""","I went into this book expecting a really good read. I am genuinely mystified as to how this book became a best-seller. The characters, though colorful and often humorous (even over-the-top), are feebly developed... a series of personality vignettes that wander in and out of the book, with very little to bind them cohesively into the story or to each other. Ultimately, I still didn't know any of them well by the end of the book, and frankly, didn't care. As to the murder-mystery itself, I felt Berendt did just enough homework to pass with a ""C"". Hugely overrated, quite unsatisfying and disappointing. A slam-bang sexy title, though..."
2,The book is barely readable and the cassette is WORSE!,"I have to say that I have not enjoyed this book. I listened to the audio tapes while commuting and I thought the narrator was awful. The narrator talks really slow and makes the book extremely boring. I guess he thinks that to sound southern one must talk in long, drawn out monotone. Moreover, it is startling to hear him use some of the degrading, offensive, and racist language that is in the book. Plainly put, this book is useless drivel. Don't waste your money buying this!"
2,Sleeper of the Year!!! -- Insomniacs Assoc.,"I have just finished this incredibly boring book about people and there lives that I could not care less about. The characters are not well defined and the circumstances and events that surround them are loosely tied together with some exhausting decriptive narrative of useless flowers and colors and streets and surroundings. The first few chapters had me booking a flight, and the rest of the book made me accept the flight cancellation fee. This book is in the running for all-time yawner with ""Prince of Tides""."
2,Northern Exposure goes South,"Did he also write the Bob Newhart show? Interesting cities are revealed by their architecture, and I'd like to meet the people who can take credit for Savannah. The South has always had eccentric and unforgettable characters, but the writer has left the impression that they're just quirky. Too much like Northern Exposure for me."
5,Absolutely Wonderful,"I listened to this book on a road trip from Minneapolis to West Virginia, it made the 13 hour drive a real treat. If I hadn't known that this was a true story I would have thought it was too far fetched, but the story and the people are all real. The narrator, Jeff Woodman, is delightful."
4,"Descriptive, entertaining...a good read for non-fiction","I loved the book. I found the history and descriptions about Savannah more interesting than the ""murder story"" itself. Planning to visit Savannah for the first time in December and really looking forward to it. Will do ""The Book"" walking tour to try to bring the story to life. Anxious to meet the ""natives"" after reading about their personalities. I have recommended the book to numerous people, but I am careful to point out that it is non fiction and if they're looking for a great murder mystery, this one isn't it. If you want an enjoyable, descriptive book that will lend a ""real feel"" to the south and the Savannah personalities, this is the one to read."
4,"Great, fun, easy read--So much better than the movie","This book is about Savannah, Georgia, more than it is about the murder trial of a self-made wealthy antiques dealer (he was charged with murdering a young man). Halfway through the book the murder still hasn't occured, much less has the trial started, but it's a great look at the South and how society-concious it still is today."
4,Well-written travelogue that reads like a piece of fiction,"I read reviews about the movie version of this book. Most of the reviews said that the movie does not do justice to the book. Friends who had watched the movie concurred. Hence, I decided to read this book. It turned out to be a rewarding experience. This travelogue resembles a piece of well-crafted fiction. The chararcters in the book are too fictitious to be true. Even Mercer House was described in a such manner that it reads too opulent to be true. Until I came across an old article on Mercer House and saw photos of it then did I finally reconcile the granduer described in the book with the actual house. I would like to pay a visit to Savannah, an endearing town with eccentric people and beautiful places.Read this book, if not for the true events of Savannah, at least for the well-written prose. I look forward to John Berendt's second book."
4,"Southern, small town, Savannah is rich in its life & people","An absorbing word portrait of those wonderful characters we all remember. A rich tapestry of southern traditions and temperment woven around a real life incident of sudden death. The author has made the people, place and event seem truly worthy of notice. A smooth read."
4,Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,"Though apprehensive about reading such a popular, trendy and gossipy book, I am glad I was persuaded to go with my initial approach! I believe that Berendt was a bit wordy at times, and the story seemed to drag a bit at certain points; but overall I found the book captivating and well-written. The amount and development of characters was inticing and led to the overall charm and appeal of the novel. I can definitley understand why it was made into a movie. Definitley a quick and easy read- excellent for summer reading. I can't wait to go to Savannah and look for the souls of Jim and his cronies (with the help of Minerva of course!)"
4,amusing and entertaining,"Having seen those near-famed cemetary images plastered all over the place when the movie came out, I was curious as to the subject and the storyline, but never bothered to follow up on it. At first just another book picked up in another airport, I found the characters well-developed and amusing, sometimes inspiring in their ""whatever"" mentality. It wasn't an obvious page-turner, nor did it keep me on the edge of my [airplane] seat. But the detailed imagery, and the flowing storylines definitely provided for an enjoyable (imagined) experience in Savannah. All in all, a good read."
4,A charming read with bizarre characters!,"The story is intriguing and well written. On audio, it's delightful. What a collection of annoying, pretentious characters! Lady Chablis is a hoot! It's hard to guess how the book will end and puzzling to try to figure out what really happened between Jim Williams and Danny Hansford. The author does a great job in making the story very much like a novel. Although it is non-fiction, I'd like to know for sure how much is real and how much is the author's creation. The book makes Savannah interesting enough to stir a desire to see the city, even if only to check out the mentality of its population! An especially interesting and revealing aspect of this book is its subtle discussion of the present-day relationship between white Christians and the blacks and Jews of Savannah. Excuse me for a minute while I call my friend from Savannah to ask about some of Berendt's zany characters. In the meantime, I suggest you read the book. :-)"
4,Terrific Characterization!,"This is one mystery story that doesn't have a surprise ending. Since it is a true story, we already know how it ends. But the real charm of this book is in the characters- and there are some real characters in here! Berendt draws pictures with words that are as compelling and intriguing as any I have read. He makes you want to finish the book just because you care enough about the people involved that it doesn't matter that you know the end. The reader comes to know these people as if we all lived in Savannah with them. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and recommend it to everyone."
4,A twisted and unique book about murder in a small town.,"As a New York City boy, John Berendt escapes to little Savannah, Georgia. He was sick of the hustle and bustle of city life, so he sought out comfort and relaxation in the small southern city. While there, he starts a book portraying the unique and quirky city. The book is divided into two parts, the first introducing the city and its' wide variety of citizens. Then one day a murder occurs, and he has a second part to the book he is writing. As the trial unfolds, the reader is welcomed into the city and feels as if they were living through the trial themselves. Berendt tells it like a story, and yet the whole thing is true. A story of trust and perseverance. Of spirituality and voodoo. A superb story of a little southern town with their southern values strongly blazing."
4,Non Fiction,"Truth is stranger than fiction.The bizarre cast of characters in Savannah, Geporgia, or thereabouts has to be seen to be believed. This is probably why it makes a decent book, as any novelist would have been happy to come up with stuff as whacky as guys walking invisible dogs, and other oddities, as well as having an interesting murder mystery in the middle of it."
5,Beautifully written,"Even if you don't care for the story line, it is so beautifully written, I do not understand how anyone could not enjoy it. It's amusing to note that the relatively few criticisms here generally have to do with the plot and the characters. Here's a quarter for the clue phone, folks: it's NON-FICTION!"
5,The Best Book Written Ever,"From the mouth of a 16 year old:This book was one of the best books i have ever read. I enjoyed the character plots and how they all intertwined in the lifestyles of Savannah. Minerva and her trademark purple glasses, and Joe with his house parties, and everyone else in this story keep the reader on their seat wanting more. And to think that these people are real(i saw them on GMA about when it came out in paperback)justs makes you think! I even went as far as to use piece of this story for an early interp piece and did fairly well. Although i cant say as much for the movie. I thoroughly enjoyed this book!"
4,midnight,Book was written very well. I just came back from Savannah Ga. and had fun seeing all the sights that were in the book.
1,Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,"This book was not what I exspected. I thought the descriptions of Savannah were inviting but, the story line just didn't hold my attention. Altho some parts of the book were funny I still had a hard time finishing it"
1,"Highly overrated, not very interesting.","One can only wonder at the reported popularity of this book.Following the presentation of some interesting facts about the city of Savanna in the first few chapters, the book is overly long and pointless."
1,I wish I could give it zero stars.,"Air-headed twaddle. Clearly this is one of those weird publishing flukes--the same phenomenon that gave us those ""Chicken Soup"" and ""Mars and Venus"" lowest-common-denominator books.Ultimately, I was sorry I slogged through to the end. Agony."
3,This book was the most honest book i have ever read.,"The novel Midnight in the GArden of Good and Evil by John Berendt is one of the few books that I just couldn't put down. A murder has taken place in Savannah, Georgia and in the mean time we get to experience the extravagant life style of the upper crust of Savannah. This is definatly one of the last places that you would expect to run into a redneck gigolo, a Nazi or a drag queen but they are all here and you will get to see how each of these people are involved in this murder and the devastating reason why it had to happen"
3,a decent attempt of description and intrigue,"this book was only ok by my standards. the description was excellent of the southern city, but other than that, it was really not that spectacular. i was disapointed because it did not live up to the expectations i had for it. i would suggest to save your money, and maybe get it at the library if you are intereste"
2,"Read it only if you are going to Savanah, Ga.","It was well written, but hey! What is the story? I know someone was killed but, when are we going to get to that. I could not put it down because I spent $16.00 to read it and I would have felt guilty if I did'nt read it."
5,Learned about the City I lived in......,"I learned more about the Savannah I lived in from this book than anywhere else. I moved to Savannah the year that Jim shot Danny, watched the Trial, was great to hear the inside story. John writes with so much passion, you can tell he enjoyed his stay in Savannah and the people. Savannah has Character, and now we know the Characters that made it."
4,Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,I thought the book was really good and informative about the Savannah area. It makes you want to go there and check it out. I was kind of dissapointed in the ending though. I guess that is what happens when you are basing a fiction book around true characters. It is definately worth reading.
1,Has it occurred to anyone,"that this book is faction, not nonfiction? How could the author possible have captured every word out of the mouths of the people he is writing about? Did he have a tape recorder with him at all times? (Unlikely, considering the occasions he describes supposedly being present at.) Does he have a superhuman memory? Hardly. Therefore, he made up about 90% of it. In addition, he ascribes thoughts, feelings, and reactions to people that he couldn't possibly know about - such as a ""smile playing about"" someone's lips when he clearly wasn't there to see it (and what a cliche THAT is). The book is also poorly structured, consisting as it does of the history of Savannah, long dull descriptions of so-called local 'characters' (which I skipped), and a murder and its trials. The result is a dog's dinner without any credibility. If it's a novel, say so at the front, don't pretend it's an accurate account. A waste of money."
5,Happy consumer,This book was received exactly as described with prompy delivery. The book describes of Savannah in a way that the reader can actually picture it's unique layout. A good read!
5,Outstanding Audiobook,"Finishing this book is like having a death in the family. It has been probably 15 years since I originally read this book. I listened to the audiobook, narrated by John Woodman, and found the book, if possible, more enchanting than the first time that I read it. The richness with which Berendt brings Savannah and its characters to life is truly incredible. For me, Woodman made the book just come to life. His narration lent another layer to the book. I felt as if I more deeply absorbed the book thanks to Woodman's narration. If you have not read this book, you have a treasure waiting ahead."
3,"Historically interesting, but rambling","The book provides a nice tour of Savannah, a fascinating story and colorful characters, but at times seems rambling and gossipy."
1,A real drag going off track,"The book unfolds with a simple narrative of a town called Savannah. The author attempts to introduce us to the town's most eccentric folks. As the introductions drag on, one starts to wonder where the story was going on. When part 2 opens with the murder of the hot-blooded lover of a dubiously gay socialite, I figure that it is a whodunit. But it isn't. As you plod through the narratives about the court room drama (which is barely there), you realise that the author still hasn't decide who or what the focus is. When you get to the end of book, you are left wondering why you even bothered to get there in the first place."
2,The Movie was Better!,"Wow I could not help but get bored reading this book. It went off in so many different directions. Stick with the movie, it makes more sense and is easier to follow."
1,Boring,"This book and the movie is the most boring I have ever read or seen. Honestly, I thought it would be a good addition to a visit to Savannah, but the book is slow starting and wouldn't waste your time with it."
4,Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,After listening to this book on cassettes and watching the movie twice it was good to read the book in its original format. This is a good mystery with a lot of twists and turns. I'd recommend it everybody.
5,The Best Book I Have Ever Read!!!,"In this book, you get onto a roller-coster that you would never want to get off. I first got the movie and I found out that it was the top of the line in my movie stack. I bought both DVD and VHS. The movie had me in a daze. So I decided to get the book to add to my collection, and this is a book that I can read over-and-over again. The way the really describe the town and the setting of things are amazing. If there was any chance to meet the cast from the movie and the writer of the book, I would take it to the heart.Midnight In The Garden Of Good And Evil--A book worth buying.-Adam Harrison"
5,Witty with a murderous edge to it.Relates well to the south.,"This book is truely hilarious! It has an edge with the murder so that the reader is asking themself, ""what happens next? Who did what to whom, truthfully?"" I enjoyed the way Berendt portrayed the south, it spoke with a realistic tone (i.e. the voodoo, and the grand southern hospitality). The Lady Chablis, I have to say, was incredibly funny. Even in the movie, she was worth the ticket!!! I stongly suggest reading the book, as well as seeing the movie."
5,Charming and thrilling.,"Although I stumbled upon this book late in it's publication, I have found it to have a charming narrative, bright dialogue and unusual insight into a community which has turned into itself. This story could only have been written by an ""outsider"", as is evident by the reaction of the Savanahites which oppose it. I found it to be charming and thrilling at the same time."
3,Not all that it is cracked up to be.,"The book was entertaining, but very hard to be taken in by into over halfway through the book."
2,"Not really a ""non-fiction"" book","This is supposedly a ""non-fiction"" book, but it is not. If you don't believe me, read the Author's Note which appears at the very end of the book, and I quote "".....I have taken certain storytelling liberties, particularly having to do with the timing of events. Where the narrative strays from non-fiction, my intention has been to remain faithful to the characters and the essential drift of events as they really happened."" Instead of saying his book ""strays from non-fiction"" why doen't he just come right out and admit, ""some of this stuff is made up."""
2,A poor picture of Savannah,"Scattered and often pointless, Midnight isnt entirely sure what type of book it wants to be or what message its sending. An occasional great character saves the book from total failure, but you are not left with any type of complete picture of Savannah."
2,Am I missing something???,I usually like the book much more than the movie but in this case the movie wins hands down. It is a haunting movie with excellent actors. The author got into the thick of things in Savannah but did not capture the characters like the movie did. Was very disappointed in the book and would urge readers to try the movie.
2,Midnight reading,"The product arrived in good condition although it was listed as used.The story, itself, is mediocre. It is part travelogue of Savannah with local characters for color. The plot starts half way through the book. All in all, it does not inspire me to visit Savannah, nor to dwell on the featured personalities. I wonder why it was on the best seller list for weeks. It was not a page-turner."
2,Am I missing something?,"I bought this book expecting it to be one of the best ever, and I struggled daily to finish it. I found the author's descriptions to be completely dry and drab, considering the topic. The only reason we might consider Savannah a eccentric, unusual, and colorful place is because the author keeps telling us we should, not because he's written it that way. So much more could have been done with this book, in the hands of a better writer. What has made it as popular as it is I cannot imagine. The movie, however, was even worse."
2,BORING,"Wow, I had to have radar to find the plot, no, it was a compass. When it did emerge, my insomnia was cured, but quickly re-occured. This book is just another slow developing, steamy (maybe) wandering tome trying to explain the South. Maybe they think the Civil War is still going on."
2,If you like characters but don't care about a story line...,"I was expecting an exciting murder mystery, but was left yawning. The book has an abundance of characters, but the author never weaves them in with any central theme. Dull story. No plot. I forced myself to finish the book because it was the reading selection for my book club, in which 9 out of 10 of us felt, for the same reasons, that we had wasted our time."
2,"SLOW PACED, NO NEED FOR THE PROFANITY, BUT STORY TELLI NG.","Clean it up !!!NO NEED FOR THE PROFANITY, AND I DO'NT KNOW WHY IT'S ON THE BEST SELLER LIST. BUT A NICE STORY TELLING TONE. I have to admit that it puts you in the authors shoes. Not for me- NOTHING THAT I WILL RECOMMEND.- I'M GLAD ITS OVER."
2,"Compelling travel guide, disappointing book.","The book does an excellent job of stirring an interest in visiting Savannah, and little else. The story itself is a contrivance, a vehicle for tying together characters in what would otherwise be an issue of People magazine. This book should be in the Savannah Chamber of Commerce, not the NY Times best seller list"
2,OK for beach reading.,"I read this book while lying on the beach in July. I usually save my lightest reading for vacation, and this proved to be the lightest of the light. Not particularly well written, the author's intrusive narrative style bothered me. It was slow in places and tedious in others. My advice is take a pass on this one. I haven't seen the movie yet, but I understand it is pretty weak as well, so perhaps I'll save myself further torture and skip it."
2,Why is this book so popular?,"This book is not well written. One winces at the long, laughably unconvincing dialogue passages that are simply exposition...e.g at a cocktail party where each guest chimes in with another chunk of Savannah history...the only colorful character is the black transvestite Chablis... at least she doesn't talk second rate jounalism, but talks instead about herself. Most of the anecdotes about colorful types in Savannah are trite, overdrawn, unconvincing.Very slow for first hundred pages.I'm astonished the reading public has the patience to slog through this book."
4,Excellently Offbeat!!!!,"I loved this book! It was offbeat but it made me keep on reading. I am recommending to anyone who likes a good book. His characters were refreshingly colorful. If you've never been to Savannah, you will feel like you were there also."
4,See the movie first,"This is the ONLY book I've ever read which has been brought to life better as a movie than on paper. You've got to see Lady Chablis for yourself!And the core of tbe plot is supposed to be an upperclass gentleman's trial for murder, but the trial's just not that interesting. And then there's a retrial...and another one...and another one...On the other hand, I appreciated a lot of the book's details that were left out of the movie. Like the author, I'm a native yankee who moved to the south...and that, in itself, is an inside joke. If you're a yankee who's never spent a good amount of time in the south, or if you're born-and-bred southern, you probably won't ""get"" the quirky yet true-to-life phrases, customs, and lifestyles which Mr. Berendt subtly but honestly portrays."
4,highly intuitive look at the secrets of the south,"Midnight ... is a suspenseful and inviting look at the south undercover. Raised in the south I was ""protected"" from much of the intrigue that happens down there. Berendt takes us into the opulent wealth of high society and invites us into their secrets, and the murder trial was a timely event that illustrates the attitudes of the community towards scandal. Ultimately this book, a ""scandalous success"" in itself, speaks about the unspeakable, the chips beneath the veneer and high shine of priceless and ""flawless"" furniture, the imperfect and disturbing nature of a society consumed by image."
3,amusing read,"I reread for my book club. Had found it a very entertaining and amusing read the first time, doesn't really hold up th second time, but that is a lot to ask."
4,Colorful read,"I definitely enjoyed reading this book. I bought it the last time I was down in Savannah and it took me forever to pick it up and read. I'm glad that I did eventually! It definitely had its slow moments but overall the book was interesting enough, set it its non-fictional/murder/mystery storytelling. And considering this book is mentioned in several other books I've read about Savannah, I'm happy this was my first read among my Savannah, GA research. The characters are colorful and the book talks so fondly of Savannah it's made me want to book another trip down there! So overall it's a good read that'll keep you interested."
4,a good read,"This book by John Berendt is an amazing one. Wasn't sure what it would be about when first started reading other than had heard it was a true story. The book is filled with unusual and interesting characters that I will remember for a long time. Rather than deal with the history of Savannah that many would write he tell of the characters, the people, the stories that they can tell and live. A wonderful experience after visiting there.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
5,midnight in the garden of good and evil,"Having just come back from Savannah, I was wishing I had read the book before we went, but it was still facinating."
4,Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,"This book consists of many colorful characters whose lives unfold in elaborate detail. In fact these characters bring out the best in this story. Once you have read this book, you are going to want to take a trip to see Savannah, Georgia for yourself. The author does a terrific job in recreating the scenery in this book. It's a tell all tale with a twist. Things are not always what they seem. If you like murder mysteries and intriguing characters I highly recommend reading this book."
2,Slow and boring.,"I read the whole book, but it took days to finish. I found it very easy to put down and walk away from. I was very disappointed. After all the publicity and great reviews, I expected to be captured and unable to stop reading...Wrong."
2,Over-rated tabloid tripe.,"I eagerly looked forward to reading this book but was awfully disappointed.Throughout the book the author basks in the reflected lightof the eccentricities and foibles of some admittedly colorfulcharacters, but, aside from stroking his own ego, never really shows any good reason for his ownpresence in the book."
1,Waste of time,"All I knew of this book was that it was about a murder. Throughout the first half of the book, I kept hoping the next new charachter introduced was the murder victim. By the time Danny was killed, I was hoping some type of nuclear explosion went off and killed everyone in that pretentious, egomaniacal, worthless town. I still hope it happens. Every day was a struggle to get through this crap. When I was done, I couldn't say I learned anything, except never to go to Georgia."
1,I must have missed something!,"I cannot for the life of me understand all the five-star and four-star ratings! I forced myself to finish it hoping that it would get better, but it didn't--at least not to me."
2,Read the book.,"Read the book and/or watch the very underrated movie. The reading of the audio book is generally dull with the exceptions of his attempts to voice the black characters, like Chablis and Minerva, which are horrible. 'Ooooh Chiild'"
1,Confused,"Parts of this book were good and other parts were hard to follow. It was some what confusing and i dont understand the real point of this book, i am not finshed with this book, i am on page 300 somthen and it has yet to get better. This book has no point to it. It was given to me by a friend. I read it but i would not be interested in ever reading it again. i would not give this book to just anyone. Only people i thought were boring and had nothing better to do than waste their time for 3 hours or so reading it."
3,Misleading condition,"The condition of the book was listed as ""good;"" however, there was a strange caked-on stain on the front cover. The book arrived in a timely manner and was a good price, but I would have considered the condition acceptable instead of good."
1,Overgrown with weeds,"Unless you have a real fetish for the city of Savannah, this book is just a generic tourist guide. It's nothing more than a novel of manners with themes we've all heard about before: old money against new money (Great Gatsby), the taboo of homosexuality, a high profile murder case (OJ Simpson, anyone?). There seems to be many unconnected events not connecting. The prose is flowery at best, confined by the inanities of nonfiction. Skip the book and watch the movie."
1,Cover Art Best Thing About This Snoozer,"The book is dull. The author is a magazine editor and the writing is quite fine, but it's an unbearably slow read. It has some quirky characters that might make interesting material for a short profile in a magazine, but I promise you that you won't care about Jim Williams or his house or any of the other people by the time you reach the end of the 387 pages that comprise this tome. Plot spoiler: He gets off. YAWN.The jacket describes the book as hilarious, haunting, and gorgeous. No. Not really. And not at all."
1,Don't Ever Believe the Hype,"I've read great reviews about this book so I finally bought it because I could not get it at my local library. Never ever finished the book - it was god-awful. Badly written, incoherent story - it jumped around - JUST PLAIN BAD..."
1,This refers to the abridged audio CD....YUCK!,"I bought this CD for a few reasons: I LOVED the text version of ""Midnight;"" I adore Anthony Heald; I needed something to listen to on a Friday night driving a long distance with my baby daughter in tow. Two words: P and U. First off, whoever was in charge of abridging stunk: lots of repetition (we hear that Berendt lived in Savannah eight years over and over again). Also, a listener who has not read the book misses out on the Lady of 6,000 Songs and other characters (you're only introduced to Jim Williams, Joe Odom, the Lady Chablis, and Danny Hansford). At three discs, it ends way too soon. The main emphasis is on Jim's trial. Heald is fantastic at doing all the voices...he is the one redeeming factor in this mess. Very very disappointing."
3,"Pleasant,fast read but oddly disturbing.","While the characters are interesting and the author has a keen eye for detail,in the end I found the work somewhat disturbing.People interested in travelogues will find it very enjoyable but might be put off by the constant intrusion of a murder case and those that enjoy a good murder and trial story might find it annoying for the story line to keep being interrupted by irrelevant albeit colorful characters.When I finished the book I could not help being somewhat confused with the trivialization of a gruesome death.A young man was killed and it has been used and read by the book buying public as just another amusing touch of Southern Gothic.The book and its success may say more about us than we may want to see.And it certainly would not make me proud to be from Savannah."
2,Deceptively attractive evil.,This is a dangerous book. The author's skill and style are so great that evil is presented as deceptively attractive. 5 for style and presentation. 0 for all else. 2 overall.
4,A good piece of commercial fiction,"Behrendt certainly knows how to write a good yarn. Like Capote's In Cold Blood, the principal characters are dead and cannot refute what he says about them. How do we know that this is true? We have only the author's word. This book is not a murder mystery, but a novel that happens to have a murder in it. Mostly, it is a gossipy look at Southern uppercrust society, with a good many ""stretchers"" as Mark Twain would say. The incident of the dead cat and the ladies' luncheon is pure urban folklore. We suspect that walking the dog is more of the same. As for style, the storytelling and dialogue are fine, but it clunks a little in places. How can an outsider ingratiate himself so thoroughly with the natives and not be sullied by the sleaze that seems to infect them? Good thing for him that he went back to New York."
5,Fasinating; mysterious and humorous,"I loved the ""characters"" in this book.I was particlarly fascinated with the people of the ""elite"" society of Savannah.Talk about a bunch of gossips with nothing better to do. My favorite character was Chablis. That person was a hoot. She was outragous with just hint of sadness in her personality. I recommend this book to anyone who likes mysteries mixed with a little ""southern flavor""."
5,Wonderful!,I loved this book. I went to Savannah because of this book! I throughly enjoyed this book! It is absolutely wonderful and I would recommend it to anyone!
4,Eccentric and unpredictable amazing true story.,"I am a fan of non-fiction stories that ""tell"" a story...this is why I picked this book up...I had seen the movie and was baffled by this story..how could this be true ?? The array of people in this story makes it quite interesting, yet barely believeable. I admit the story drags a bit, as we wait the fate of Jim Williams, however, by the time we find out, we already know what will happen based on the happenings in Savannah...Minerva is really cool...I think some of us could benefit from her !!! Enjoy"
4,Modern day Prejudice,"After visiting Savannah and hearing so much about this book, its cast of characters and seeing the actual locale, I just had to read it. John Berendt has a very humorous way of depicting what is really a very sad story about blue-blood snobbery and a tragic murder. You can't help but love Joe Odom & his freeloading lifestyle. I enjoyed this book & can easily recommend it to any broadminded person"
3,Somewhat hard to follow,"While I enjoyed reading ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,"" I had a hard time trying to keep track of all of the characters. While the number of characters add to the story, I found myself continually flipping back to pages to try and remember who is who. A great read, but you might want to have a pen and paper handy."
3,Nothing special,"First, the characters are somewhat interesting in the way that many alcoholic, affluent types are, but the storyline never weaves them together in a way that makes the book itself intersting. Second, the author is trying to strike a balance between 1. historic integrity and theme, 2. his first account experiences, and 3. what might make for an interesting read. I think he relies heavily on his first account experinces at the expense of history and an interesting story. My real motivation for finishing the book was to see if I knew any of the characters - I grew up not far from Savannah."
4,Just a few thoughts..,Well written....Well presented...I was enthralled with the way the author weaves the history of Savanah into the mystery.Surprising ending...Thought provoking...The ending presents and interesting twist...I LIKED it!
3,Love stories of the quirky South.,A very easy and enjoyable read. Unlike my usual routine I saw the movie before I read the book. It was a great journey of real people woven into a wonderful tale. Makes me want to visit Savanah.
3,Pleasantly surprised,I was pleasantly surprised with this book. I had heard good things so I decided to purchase it. When I decided to read it I wasn't sure if I was ready to read a non-fiction but I'm glad I did as this book reads like a fiction book. The first half you get to know the characters and the second half is written mainly around a murder. Very entertaining and well written.
4,I'm bad at titles.,"A few years ago, I moved to the South; people kept insisting that I read Gone With the Wind. I couldn't get through it (I know, damn Yankee).But then someone told me I should read Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, and I recalled the movie of the same title, but I hadn't seen it. Admittedly, this book was gifted to me, but I'm glad they did!This book explained a lot more about the Southern mindset than I think GWTH could. The way folks reacted and behaved was insightfully explained. There's a guy who lives a few blocks over from me who very much reminds me of one of the characters in this book.I enjoyed it very much."
4,"""Midnight in the Garden.."" Rings Truth","A non-fiction dissection of a small, southern city, ""Midnight.."" reveals the crudest facts behind the average everyman in the pseudo-modern South. The author's approach is brilliant. He covers a high-profile murder case, while still managing to broach the subjects of homosexuality, transexuality, witchcraft, and racism (to name a few). This story can only stem from reality, which adds to its brilliance."
2,"Starts off intriguing, goes nowhere","I too am mystified as to how this book became such a runaway best seller. The book starts out well, introducing us to a cast of crazies and describing Savannah in such a rich way that we are immediately drawn in. Unfortunately, the subsequent murder story with Jim Williams seems tacked on, and amounts to little more than a rehash of the verdicts in his four trials. In the end, the book seems to be more of a long magazine article than a cohesive work of non fiction. A major disappointment."
5,Captivating,I truly enjoyed each of the characters in Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. After a fashion I came to believe they were my friends and looked forward to returning to them every night when I read.Being vaguely familiar with some of the areas written about helped me appreciate the book even more.
4,Best in its genre,"This reviewer cannot add much to the myriad reviews already put forward, in terms of reviewing the narrative. Just be sure, if you contemplate giving this as a gift, that your intended recipient can deal with the subjects involved. Not everyone is charmed by this saga of murder, transgender hijinks and a decadent milieu. Me? I can, so I enjoyed the book and the film."
3,Magic Carpet Ride To The City Of Self Absorption!,"I had mixed feelings about this book. I liked the author's voice, but found most of the characters to be unattractive. Berendt's characters are eccentric, head strong and wildy outrageous, but for me, they lacked the substance to make them interesting. Whether rich or poor, all the characters are truly self absorbed and therefore boring. Emma, the road singer was the exception. She's an amazing soul who shares her gift of song tirelessly. The murder thread didn't make this book more compelling. I found myself losing interest. Somehow Savannah in all its self absorbtion was both forgettable and unforgettable, and therein lies the ambiguity. The book is provocative enough to warrant a look, so that you can decide for yourself."
2,Nonfiction? Historical?,"This book is broken into two parts, the murder mystery and the Characteristics of Savannah, which include people as well as places. The author chooses to put himself in as a character as he relates the information about the murder he has investigated. He introduces the murderer in the first chapter, then doesn't revisit him until chapter 11. In the meantime he tells the reader about Savannah, the culture of the people, the kinds of attitudes of the people, he describes the homes and the characters. I found the book cumbersome and boring. It was supposed to make me want to go see this magical place. It didn't. I would see the movie only to see how it would relate to the book."
4,Lovin' It,"If this is anything like the movie, this book will be amazing!! I just purchased it for my Kindle and I cannot wait to read it. I think its about a few hundred pages. I cannot wait until a break in class to check it out."
5,book bargain,Good value - good service. The book came in on time and in the condition posted - will use this site again.
3,The Games People Play,"This was an entertaining study of the games people play in a smallish southern city. Berendt's descriptions of Savannah's atmosphere and the real character's he met there are excellent. Berendt has a great grasp of local Savannah politics. His initial enthusiasm for the place became tempered toward the end of the book as languid Savannah's also a provincial place that tolerates a certain amount of violence and mumbo jumbo, depending on who the perpetrators and targets of both are. The book's end came rather quickly and perhaps a bit incompletely, what happened to Danny Hansford's mom and her lawsuit? Berendt's description of his attending Savannah's African American debutante's ball was hilarious. The main point of this book seemed to be in real life the truth is often hard to find and when it's found it's often awful, but that money often buys the alternate truths that make it into the papers, and that's the truth that people buy."
5,Not your Garden Variety Novel,"Berendt, in his novel Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, has painted a vivid, bittersweet portrait of a city that burns with passion and seeths with ancient mystery. His blend of soft prose, engaging dialogue and real-life characters and experiences draws the reader into a world where anything is possible. Though the story is excellent, the true virtue of this book is the loving, intricate, powerful depiction of Savannah itself and the many unique characters that inhabit it. Many interesting facts about Savannah come to the surface, and many other facts that one wouldn't ordinarily know about (for instance, the Johnny Mercer House, around which much of the story revolves, was used as one of the settings in the film Glory). Berendt knows this city, knows its people, and his loving touch and style brings out the truth of Savannah. A book definately worth the price of admission. Please Check it out. You won't be sorry. Enjoy!"
5,This book got me into literature,"Well, I never was a big fan of reading, let alone literature. The reason I bought this book at first place, was because of its cover. When I saw the ""Bird Girl"" I said, "" I want to go there"". The book is absolutely fantastic. It is the way it is written, not so much the facts it talks about. Since I read the book, I have booked a flight to Savannah, to spend a week there, and I am also reading one book a month, which is a miracle compared to one book/2 years I used to read before....thank you John Berendt, thank you Savannah."
3,good but doesn't live up to hype for this reader,"had i not heard & read so many superlative things about this book in advance, i prob would not have been disappointed. but i did and i was.first what's good: as many reviewers have pointed out, berendt picks out a great subject -- savannah, ga. Even without a great story, the local history and color is worthy of a book by itself. equally, berendt immerses himself in his subject and unearths wonderful character studies.having said that, this book did not intoxicate & engross me the way i thought it would. in part this is because i am a big fan of tom wolfe, who frankly covers this kind of non-fiction (once known as new journalism) better. even hunter thompson -- who admittedly mines very different terrain -- is more engrossing (fear & loathing on campaign trail, hell's angels, etc.,) than this book. at times this felt like a magazine piece bloated to book proportions.so kudos to berendt for a good book, but I cannot elevate to classic status."
2,Not a great book,This book has quirky but only mildly interesting characters. They carried on so much they got very boring. They all are also very selfish and self- centered that I ended up not caring about anyone.The story of Conrad Aiken was good though.
1,A huge waste of my time!,"One of my teachers gave me this book to read because she was bored with it. I thought it would be a great book because of all I'd heard, BOY WAS I WRONG! I hate this book, I wish I hadn't wasted my time."
1,Most over rated tome of all time,"this is absolutely the most over rated book i've ever read. terribly written, incredibly boring, and lacks even a modicum of suspense. I found myself not really caring whodunnit. it was an absolute struggle to finish...i did only to see if i was missing something given all the hype. i cannot believe the author is an editor...his skills leave me wanting."
1,"I just don't ""get it""!","Angela's Ashes was a touching book. Nathan's Run was engrossing . . . But Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil was never a page-turner. Not once did I ""feel"" for any of the characters . . . and my only memorable feeling while reading the book was an interest in getting through it. Someone PLEASE explain its popularity! I just don't get it!"
1,Beautifully worded descriptions combined with vulgarity,"I was looking for a mystery novel on the order of John Grishom's--too much to hope for. I didn't need to know how transvestites hide their masculinity nor read tirades of cursing. Aside from occasional beautiful descriptive text, I found the book boring and vulgar. I put it down after forcing myself to read about 1/2. I kept hoping it would get better."
5,Midnight in the garden of good and evil,this was a wonderful book full of possibilites and endless options of happiness.
1,This book does not deserve 5 stars!,"I listened to it on my way to work, and since you don't have much to do but listen to the radio, look at the cars around you, or listen to whatever is on your CD player... oh, well, I did listen to this CD. I had heard wonders about this book and figured it would be good. But guy was I wrong! To begin with, the reader is terrible, and that probably doesn't help. But on top of that the story is simply going nowhere."
1,What in the world am I reading???,"This might be my least favorite read of all time. I see that it got good reviews from most people, which disturbs me more than the book. I found it very hard to read because I was constantly turned off by the vulgar and derogatory language. I finally got through it for the sake of my book club but will definitely not recommend it."
4,I like it,"I have been a ""FIRM"" fan for a long time and started with the Original Volume 1 with Susan Harris. These are a little ""dated"" as are the classic original volumes 1-6, but I like these workouts for a change. They may not be as challenging as the classics, but they still give me a good workout. I would recommend them to anyone who likes Anna Benson workouts. Some of the negatives; the cueing is the not best in some areas, some of the camera angles are shot on an angle (ie: not straight forward so it's harder to tell if your on the right let or left), and I would prefer a more challenging cardio workout, but it still gets my heart rate up, and it's easy to just make some of the moves a higher impact. Overall, I do like all the set."
1,Defective outlet or poor design,"The 120 V outlet is either defective or poorly designed (or perhaps both). A standard 3-wire grounded plug only makes contact the last 1/8"" of insertion. Any slight movement of the plug breaks the circuit. The connectors for a voltmeter also did not fit properly (way too tight). In the same order I also bought the Amprobe ELS2A splitter. It is much better made and all of the connectors worked well. I returned the Extech unit to Amazon in exchange for another Amprobe unit."
3,Can't try it. Doesn't work with Klein CT3100 hook style ammeter,"I have a Klein CT3100 hook-style ammeter that has it's own problems -- for example, it can only hook around conductors up to -- ? -- 1/0 or so, because the hook opening is too narrow. This also prevents the CT3100 from being used to measure current in the Extech 480172 line splitter. So I guess this is more of a poo-poo of the Klein than the Extech -- if a current meter should be able to do anything, it's clamp around a 120V, 20A Maximum line splitter! Still, I see no reason why a line splitter needs to be as thick as this one. Maybe they all are? But why?"
3,"Works well, but holes are a bit small","Pretty much just works as advertised. Like the 10x turns hole which is helpful for improving measurement accuracy with small loads. As noted in other reviews, the holes are too small for some current probes to fit. Holes for voltage probes are handy, but not suitable for long-term measurements."
5,Must-have for appliance trouble-shooting,"A line splitter is a essential piece of gear for anyone interested in how much power a appliance is drawing. They allow you to measure power consumption and voltage while shielding you from the 120VAC line voltage. This unit has two square holes for use with a clamp-on amp-meter. One hole is for measuring the current as-is (i.e. 1x), while the other hole has the hot wire looped around it 10x inside, allowing you to make more sensitive measurements with the current clamp.I like the color (harder to leave behind by accident), and the construction appears to be similar to all the other line splitters out there. For all I know, they all come out of the same factory or were based on the same design."
5,Excellent Book with Real Q's & A's that are relevant,My new born daughter was recently diagnosed with Complex Congential Heart Defects and naturally I wanted to learn as much as I could about the topic. I purchased several related boks through Amazon.com and founf this one to be very relevant and answered lots of appropriate questions for me. I would recommend this book to anyone who would like to learn more about Heart Defects of any type. It is very thorough and covers every defect I am aware of.
5,Fantastic read...,"Lliteras is a fasinating writer for our times and it shows with his effort ""Judas the Gentile."" A book based on Judas, the man who betrayed Jesus Christ, and how he spent the evening of our Messiah's crucifixion. Told with wonderful imagery yet easy to read sentences, Lliteras gets to the heart of Judas's thoughts and the torment of his mind. His style is discriptive and very easy to read. Lliteras is also loyal to the Bible in every respect, not ""recreating"" but rather conveying a picture for the 21st century reader. A must for anyone who appreciates the Christian mind."
1,Will not play because it is not actually a Blu-Ray disk,I am in the process of returning this disk to amazon.com.The disk will not play properly on my Pioneer BDP-05FD Blu-Ray playerwhich has the latest firmware. The sound is faint and distorted.Pioneer Support has told me that it will not play because it isactually a DVD+R AVCHD disk. (No wonder I first noticed that itdid not look like any Blu-Ray disk I have ever seen.)
3,THIS IS NOT A BLU-RAY DISC,"Yes, amazon has it categorized as a Blu-Ray disc, but it is not Blu-Ray.Please read the description carefully before you order."
1,Blue ray disc is not playing,I want to know how to return DVD once is not playing corretly on device.I have bought 8 and just this one is not working.
5,Excellent quality candles,"Beautiful, sturdy, long-burning, quality candles; shipped well, too! Sorry, I do not have more words to use to describe this purchase!"
3,Under Rated Author,"Jose Yglesias, an American novelist, journalist, and playwright of Spanish and Cuban descent, died in New York City in 1995. His best work was A Wake in Ybor City. This book in my view takes a too whimsical look at life in Castro's Cuba but still enjoyable to read"
2,Not recommended for beginners,"I am afraid I can't wholly recommend this text for people taking a first look at probabilities, especially if they are studying independently. The major problem is Li's lack of clarity and explanation. He just seems unnecessarily confusing and abstract. He does state essential points right up front, but not enough attempt is made to provide intuitive or common-sense explanations. Examples are mostly derivations of special cases. More useful examples are provided at the end of chapters, but they would be better if integrated with the text. Readers experienced with the subject might appreciate Dr. Li's terseness, but for beginners I would more highly recommend ""The Probability Tutoring Book"" by Ash."
1,Confusing book,The teacher sucked at presenting the materials of this book. It was expected that we would read the chapters and do the homework problems. I couldn't. I think this book is only good for people who already know probability and statistics.
5,Good match for Isuzu rodeo 1998 V6,"I installed it like a week ago and so far it is working perfect, shipping was really fast too and it was a good match for my Isuzu rodeo 1998 with a V6 engine."
2,AN OK ITALIAN WESTERN.,"I bought this movie becuase I thought Bud Spencer was a main character! He is only in it for 10 minutes! Besides that I was entertained! It was a good story about a Checkezlovakian (did i spell it right?) who is payed to come to the united states to deliver some money to James Cooper (Bud Spencer) but a clever thief (Lee Van Cleef) and his buddy (Lionel Stander) steal the money and they are happy but Bud isnt. Strangley the Checkezlovakian becomes good friends with the men who stole his money and he asks thier help to find it! Its and ok movie Not worth paying more than 5 dollars.I suggest other westerns like ""TODAY ITS ME TOMORROW ITS YOU"", ""ACE HIGH"", MY NAME IS NOBODY"" which is one of the best movies ever!, and the ""TRINITY"" films."
3,A Fair Western with a Comic Touch,"Don't run out and pay top dollar for this movie, but if you can get it on sale somewhere it might entertain you. Van Cleef does a good acting job as the reluctant lawman. There are some decent comic touches. The movie drags a bit in the middle and some of the acting is lousy and the production values (even by 1968 standards) are low. Not too terrible a way to spend a couple of hours on a dull weekend. One big howler of a mistake was a major character, Novak, describes himself as a Czechoslovakian. Czechoslovakia was not founded as a state until 1919, long after the Wild West era ended. He should have described himself as a Bohemian or Moravian. Gee, its usually the Americans that don't know anything about European history, but here the Italians mess up!"
1,Bad BEYOND REGCONITION. Zero star.,"The DVD quality is a nightmare. The picture looks washed out. Most of the objects on screen are in orange color. Even the grass, the shrubs are in orange! The people look out of proportion. The plot is boring."
5,An Intelligent and Useful Guide to the New Economy,"As a regular reader of technology books, I have yet to come across a work that cuts through all of the e-cliches and e-hype. In Mastering the Digital Marketplace, Douglas Aldrich does a masterful job of explaining how the digital economy affects real businesses in the real world. I believe this is a must read for any executive responsible for making his company competitive in the new economy. The cases that Mr. Aldrich draws upon as examples provide clear and compelling illustrations of his thesis."
4,Good reference book for starting a new Internet business,"Anyone thinking of starting a new Internet business or currently has one should definitely read this to gain a good perspective on the rapidly changing dynamics of the growing E-commerce industry. The ""How To"" diagnostics and case studies should help you avoid some of many pitfalls that can be encountered in this highly competitive worldwide economy. I found it to be very easy reading and put together in an understandable format."
5,Goodnight Funny Man,"Doug Aldrich, the author of this book, passed away on December 26, 2003. He will be missed by all that knew him."
1,Vacuous doubletalk from yet another management consultant,"This book is an overblown, empty text. Mostly nonsensical -- the only practical parts are painfully obvious."
4,Loved the screaming walls,"Loved the screaming walls. ""Hope and possibilities glittered. I say yes."" What a great way to end a love story. Fun read and vivid interplay with light and dark and reality and illusion. Can't wait to read book 2."
3,Is there more?,"I read the new offering in a single sitting. It was a good read...not her best and not her worst. I wanted more of the loose ends tied up. Who else had psychic talents? Ethan? Arcadia? Who was Arcadia's powerful husband? Where is that story line going? Or did it stop with jazz and a P.I.? This Krentz won't be a keeper on my shelves, but it is a good, fast read."
4,A Good Guilty Pleasure,"Jayne Ann Krenz's Light in Shadow is a wonderful guilty pleasure, a romantic thriller that is well-done and compelling. The story of Zoe Luce, an interior designer with a hidden past is light fun reading. I definitely will read Truth or Dare, the sequel to this novel. I am sure it will be as much fun to read as this one. Enjoy."
3,"Good, but not great","This was good read, with really good characters and a great plot, but it just didn't ""spark"". Since I love reading suspense, drama and romance, the storyline really drew me in and I had great expectations. However, everything seemed tied up too neatly. Overall, this was a light, funny and interesting read with characters I really liked. I will read the next book, Truth or Dare, with these two characters, but will not expect too much drama."
4,Good.... But Not the Best,"I thought this book was pretty good, but not the best. The psychic storyline seemed underdeveloped. I liked the plot and the characters but it felt like she didn't take the time to really delve into all the seperate storylines. There was just too much going on at once. As far as the romance aspect, it was barely there (so if that's what you're looking for, look elsewhere). Overall, it was a light, good read but nothing special. Not the best, not the worst."
2,"She's An Industry, Not An Author","I've no quarrel with the plotting, though it's pretty fantastic, or the characters who fit the genre requirements but I'm soooo diappointed with this novel on two counts.I've rarely seen a novel so poorly edited. For instance, on one page, the private investigator is named ""Evan"" and then ""Ethan"" about 4 lines later.I also sorely miss the humor that Krantz excelled at weaving into her stories and that gave her characters more of a 'just like you and me' quality with which the reader could identify.Krantz has turned into an industry instead of an author."
2,Disappointing ...,"Where was the ""Romance"" ??? The flawed main characters Ethan (3 bad marriages behind him).. and Zoe (she hears walls moaning) both seemed somewhat pathetic ..If one hot scene of unprotected sex equals romance .. I may give up reading Krantz .. I am so glad this was a library book ..."
3,Not up to par,"Being a fan of Krentz, I was disappointed with Light in Shadow. The book had poor character development; I finished it not feeling much more strongly about the characters than I did on the first page.One positive thing I would like to say is that the book did move. It almost seemed more like 2 or 3 books/stories in one. Unfortunately, I think this pulled away from the characters in the book and left them somewhat one dimensional and dull.I am a big fan of this author and would recommend her books, I just hope this one was a fluke."
2,Not worth the full price,"This is a sub-par novel for the author. I bought it and was disappointed in the characters and the plot. I have other Krentz books that are excellent. This, unfortunatly, was not."
4,Don't make the same mistake I did,"This book is classic Innes. But it has also been published under the title ""Fire in the Snow"". So if you are like me, trying to catch up on his early books, just be aware that the same book lurks under different titles."
5,Sine qua non,"Unless you have been part of a weekly poker game, you may not understand why I like this book, particularly the section on ""ethics and etiquette,"" so much. There really is some honor among thieves. Life really is more fun (and chaos more enjoyable) when we adhere to the letter and spirit of the rules."
1,not very informative,I bought to look up the rules of Euchre and it had hardly anything here. I thought the book sucked....
3,Complete but confusing,Very extensive but more detail and variations than I really needed. I wanted more of the basic rules that were easy to skim over to refresh my memory.
2,Waste of Paper,"Hoyle's Rules of Games, Third Revised and Updated EditionThere are easier to understand and more up-to-date descriptions of gameplay for most of the more popular games on the internet. The book is particularly weak on diagrams, which simplify understanding of many of the games tremendously. I would consider this book to be useful as supplementary information only; it would not be my first choice for learning a new game from scratch."
4,Necessary Book!,"When you are retired and the weather is too hot or too cold to be outside, and the television is an insult to your intelligence, values, and morals-and maybe you're not up to any hanky-panky--take out a deck of cards to play a good game with your spouse! JUST BE SURE YOU HAVE THIS BOOK TO KEEP FROM ARGUING ABOUT THE RULES!"
5,Family Fun,"We have two pre-teens and love to play games, especially while camping. We had an old Hoyles book and started to go through different variations of poker, and the kids ate it up. Now they each have their own books, and they experiment with different games together all the time. IMHO, this is so much better for them than video games or TV that words can't express my appreciation for this gaming institution."
2,Hoyle's Rules of Games,"Book is NOT user friendly, did not help me learn the game of Hearts...book is written to those that already know more than I do and my friend agreed."
4,Great collection of rules,Ordered this to learn to play different types of card games with my family and we love it. Christmas holiday fun.
3,Blade stinks,"I bought this to go with the G0580 Bandsaw and it installed just fine. Wheels stayed planer, etc. The blade is worthless. It has no set and drifts miserably. If you buy this setup be sure to buy a different blade because you're going to throw this one away (Unless they change them or I just got a lemon.)"
3,Interesting but not superb thriller!,"This is definitely an interesting and unusual thriller. There is plenty of suspense, and the characters are reasonably well-developed. All legal thrillers to some degree are exagerrated. However, most of them are grounded in some reality. This one is not and that is the major weakness of this book. A psycho juror is not plausible, and detracts what could have been a compelling fictional account of the court system. Taken as an action thriller, the story has enough fun and suspense to succeed. Taken as a courtroom drama, it lacks enough reality and truly thought provoking drama to succeed. Those seeking realistic courtroom drama are advised to seek out the Phillip Friedman novels Inadmissible Evidence and Reasonable Doubt."
3,Impressive ... but predictable,"I recently finished my first book by John Martel (which I bought based on the excellent reviews it has received on Amazon). I agree with other reviewers that it was a good book with very entertaining courtroom scenes, but it did have some weaknesses. The functioning psychotic ""alternate juror"" was just too crazy to act so rational and hold up so well during critical periods in the book. In addition the romances, relationships and tidy ending had me wanting something more creative from such a talented author. I will definitely read Mr. Martel's next book, but I hope he does a better job at keeping me guessing."
3,"A Good, Fast Read But Somewhat Overrated!","The Alternate is a legal thriller that is fast-paced and will hold your interest. However, I felt the earlier reviews tend to overrate the book. I found that while the plot had many twists, most were predictable. Further, the relationships between the key characters were also able to be predicted well in advance. Nonetheless, Martel tells a story that will make you want to read on and has developed characters that you will care about. Actually, while I rated The Alternate a '3', it really deserves a '3 1/2'."
3,trial groupie,"legal potboiler where fatal attraction meets the godfather in a schmaltzy way. despite a solid framework - pretrial prep, trial and retrial- the interjection of an overly used plot device - the brilliant psychopathic serial killer- dooms the story to a trite finale."
3,"A Good Read, But Has Room For Improvement","This courtroom thriller keeps your eyes glued to the pages with its unexpected twists and its hints of things to come. However, some of the characters could be further developed rather than mentioned briefly and discarded. Also, a great deal remains unresolved that had me, at least, crying out, ""Well, what happened to ...?"" Still, a good book to curl up with."
2,Why did I buy this in Hardcover?,"OK, I liked Martel's first and I need diversion. But this was so muddled and incredible that it was a diversion trying to read it. Push-button characters. leaden words and a ridiculous ""plot.'' Not to mention a villain who's portrayed as incredibly stupid but keeps getting away with it. Come on! You can do better than this."
2,2-in-1: Mediocre curler and straightener,"I bought this because it seemed really convenient (and required half the space to store it, too). Unfortunately, having a 2-in-1 (like 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner) seems to mean that both of its parts are mediocre at best.The curling iron doesn't give my hair a lasting curl like my friends' curling irons. My best friend has a Hot Tools curling iron that she LOVES, and the curls stay forever!The straightening iron only works if you put in teeny bits of hair at a time, and MAN, it rips my hair out!I wouldn't suggest this to anyone. I think you're better off having separate curling and straightening irons..."
4,Good Good Good,Okay I have to say that it was a really goooooood piece of machine but it has one flaw....even though it looks really cool i have had mine for about a year and i left it on one day and of course it shut its self off (great feature) but when i turned it on the next day to use it the plastic around the iron had melted then when i tried to turn the iron on it wouldnt turn on
4,straightener and curling iron,It straightens very easily and makes great curls. Part of handle does get in the way but you learn to work around it.
2,conair 2-in-1 straighter and curling iron,The product is good the only problem I have with it is when you use the curling iron part of it the clip doesn't hold it closed like it's suppose to
1,Broke after using first time,"Not sure if mine's a fluke, but the mechanism that holds the straightening plates together so you can use the curling iron instead didn't lock in and wouldn't lock no matter what. I could still use the straight iron part (not that great on its own), but doesn't defeat the purpose of having something that's supposed to do two different jobs? Needless to say, I returned it."
5,hot iron and great value,Great bargin. I have pretty thin hair and the flat iron part of it straightens all my hair in 5 min. it is a little bulky to use at first. i am a total klutz and i have not burned myself yet. the curling iron part works just like a regular curling iron.
5,"Good Product, Good Price!","Been using this product for years! Gentle, non-irritating cleanser to do a less-than-fun job! I hadn't thought of checking on here to purchase it before, wish I had - was almost 2 bucks cheaper & I didn't have to run all the way in town to get it! Packaged securely, shipped fast thanks to Prime! Another great purchase from Amazon!"
2,not thought out well,I like the whole idea of using a calculator on the computer but this one wasn't laid out properly as it slowed me down instead of making me more productive.The tab key and control keys could have been placed better.
3,Adequate filtration for a decent price,"We got this to replace a similar unit from Walmart. It looked like this would be substantially better, but I would say it is about the same. This unit is a little louder in the quietest useful mode (there is a quieter mode which probably filters one liter of air per hour.) The problem with these units is that the replacement filters cost almost as much as a new unit if you put a few discounts together. If the replacement filters were reasonable in price, I would more highly recommend this unit. As it is, I can only give it an adequate rating."
4,Attractive Whtie Air Filter,"The Delonghi DAP 130 arrived with the delicate front grill slightly dented. Iwas able to pull it back out with a paper clip to restore its attractive modern look. The machine operates well at 4 speeds including a barely audible ""sleep"" setting. I like the higher settings for the white noise effect in my office. Its hard to know how well it filters the air without a professional testing lab. I haven't been able to find other reviews regarding its efficacy. Mine was a gift and didn't come with an instruction manual so I don't know why there is a separate switch for the ionizer. I assume one would always want the ionizer to be on. It seems to work very well."
1,No effect on dust,I bought this filter hoping it would help address the dust problem I am having at home but after a week of use I see no effect whatsoever on dust. I am not sure what else it is expected to do but it gets a failing grade on this one.
3,enh,"I like this album right now, but i don't konw if it's good enough that i'll be able to say that in a year. There are some songs that I really like, 10 milion ways to die, caliente, but a lot of it was boring. it's worth a listen and definitely see them live if you get the chance, but not an amazing album."
3,Package Damaged,So far the DVDs work fine. But I paid for and was expecting new DVDs. The packaging for the DVDs looks like it's been dropped a couple of times or like it was damaged on the shelf and sold at a discounted price online. I have older DVDs than this and they looker newer and in better shape.
5,great product,"Received this product early. It was neatly packaged, still in original wrapping. Loving the trip down memory lane. Recommended if you are a Hogans Heroes fan. The price was a bargain."
4,Good Product - Poor Package,Like others - It was great to have the entire series all-in-one. The package design is poor & will cause the product to wear out prematurely.
5,Hogan's Heroe's Fan from way back.,"Don't mind have a cold or rainy weekend to watch Hogan's Heroe's. I thought over my teen years, I'd seen all of the episodes but I was wrong. Some on the first season were new to me. I'm only on the 2nd season, last DVD in DVD player just waiting for a lazy day."
5,Hogan's Heroes,Most excellent....It brings back memories of my teenage years...What a wonderful series....Anyone who watchedthis when it first came out should watch it again....
3,SHAFTED BY PARAMOUNT,"I just looked at the back of this box set The Kommandant Kollection of Hogan's Heroes at the store the other day. I noticed that there is new bonus material. I already have the individual season sets that we're in the slim cases. So what does that mean? That I have to buy this entire collection just to get all this new bonus material that I would really like to see? I DON'T THINK SO!Paramount just knows how SHAFT the die hard customers who already bought the entire series before this release only to put out a complete collection with new bonus material that you can't get anywhere else. Pathetic!How bout this PARAMOUNT! Why don't you release just the bonus material by itself so that people like me can own it. But we all know that is not gonna happen. Hogan's Heroes was a great classic TV show. Just wish the new material would have been released earlier. Because of that, NO SALE HERE! That is why I gave this product 3 stars."
1,"Great Series, Horrible packaging!!!!","Hogans Heroes itself deserves 5 stars for being one of the all-time classic tv series that have withstood the test of time and still entertains and delights viewers to this day. UNFORTUNATELY the packaging from the manufacturer is inadequate and allows all the discs to come loose during shipping and scratch and damage nearly all of them. Its packaging must be a runner-up to the Stargate SG-1 series packaging for most lousy packaging of any series EVER!!!!! I am just not clear on why Amazon hasnt acted on these repetitive complaints to protect their consumer community from such flagrant violations of their customers by these companies, Hey Amazon, remember the old addage ""an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure"" but I guess such a large company can afford to rest on its laurels, too bad."
4,"A great set, however.......","It's so nice to see a complete box set for this TV show. However, was it really necessary to put great bonus features in this set that were not in the individual sets? Thank you Paramount for thinking so little of those who shelled out their hard-earned money for the previous sets, only to offer new bonus features that those customers didn't get."
1,What a way to fleece more money out of people.,"I bought the complete set about three years ago. Now they release this thinking people are dumb enough to buy both setS? Apparently they probably will find a few fools. Only an idiot would buy this for full price that already bought the previous set, just to get one bonus disc. Corporate theivery at its finest. I will just wait for a year or 2 when the used copies sell for $10.00."
4,Hogan's Heroes,Just like most everyone has complained about the packaging it does suck.The dvd's themselve's play just fine if they are not scrached.These I purchased seem to play very well so far.I am Pleased with this purchase from Amazon Prime.I have not found any DVD's that were scrached so far.
2,The Wedding Cake Book Did Not Taste So Good,"Disappointed with the book... lovely pictures... I returned it to Amazon, due to my expectations not being met. Cannot and will not recommend this to anyone who is more than a beginning baker."
3,The Wedding Cake Book by Dede Wilson,I rated this book with 3 stars because there is no taste of cake and the style I like for my upcoming wedding next year. It have limited opitions.
2,not my cup of tea,"i have been a cake decorator for many years and i am always looking for new ideas and books,,,but i didnt even buy this book. the photos are very nice but the cakes are very ordinary and the inside of the book doesn't live up to what's on the cover."
3,Worth owning ... but,"While I'm honestly happy to have this book in my collection, I cannot say it represents the epitome of the art of cake decorating. While Ms. Wilson most assuredly knows what's she's doing, her choices for art director and photographer have let her down, badly.Several photos border on the kitchy and the photography is not of the calibre it ought to be. Pity, because the end result is that book appears to be both amateurish and dated when probably in fact her work is neither.See through these flaws and, again, this is a book worth owning, but for pure visual inspiration, there are far better books out there."
3,Good Reference Book For Recipes,"This book is a good reference book for cake recipes. I have not yet attempted to make any cakes as some ingredients are hard to come by or never heard of before eg cake flour, chantilly cream. All the cakes look delicious though but most are royal iced or butter cream iced cakes, not many sugar paste or fondant iced cakes. This book has basic and few instructions on piping and making sugar flowers as most of the cakes in her book are decorated with just cream, berries or fresh flowers. If you are a cake decorator and are tired of making fruit cake, mud cake or madeira and wish to increase your recipe library, this book is perfect for you as long as you know where to get the ingredients."
2,Not for the normal wedding,"This book is not the one you want to buy if your looking for wedding cake ideas. The cakes in this book are unrealistic, theres even a recipe for a cake made out of fish ---ewww--- If your just learning how to make cakes and want something for fun then this book is for you but please dont waste your time trying to get nice elegant wedding cakes out of it."
1,Don't judge a book by it's cover,"I bought this book looking for new ideas. I have been baking wedding cakes for family and friends for years and I am now doing my son's. Notice they don't show you any pictures of cakes in the, ""see inside"", section that is because they are all ugly except the one on the cover. Fortunately, with Amazon you can make returns easily. Which I did immediately."
5,These cakes are not just for weddings!,"Dede Wilson's clear instructions and love of fine ingredients inspired me to take her advice and try my hand at a few ""practice"" cakes. I took the Chocolate Raspberry Truffle cake to a potluck dinner, and it was the hit of the party! I enjoyed the White Chocolate Apricot cake so much, I'm making another one. Because Wilson includes individual recipes for the sizes of all the tiers, from 6"" up to 14"" in some cases, the reader can make a smaller cake for any type of function. I believe this book IS for the typical bride, if the typical bride is someone who loves the best ingredients combined in a pleasing manner and presented beautifully. I've tried samples of wedding cake from six local professional bakers, and the cakes I've made from this book top them all! Brides, please keep in mind that some wedding cake bakers use mixes; armed with Wilson's book, a bride is sure to serve the best on her wedding day, or any other day that calls for a cake."
2,I was very disappointed with the photos.,"I am a wedding cake designer and am always searching for beautiful cake pictures to show my customers. This book was sadly lacking the kind of cake design that most (any) bride would find appealing. The photo on the cover is misleading as far as the other cakes pictured in the book.And what is the deal with a smoked salmon cheesecake wedding cake? I will admit that there are some very interesting recipes in the book, but it should not be used as a reference for cake design."
3,The Wedding Cake Book,"I was looking for more traditional types of wedding cake pictures for reference to potential customers. Although the presentation of the book was beautiful, personnaly I was disappointed I do not think my potential customers would go for the exotic type of cake decorating that was used on these cakes in the book. I was looking for a reference book that had more practical, elegant ideas. Some of the cakes were too unusual,(a coconut covered wedding cake) or too plain. I guess it just was not what I was looking for."
3,Consideration,"This movie would have been rated a five star had it not been for an over zealous translation in the sub-titles of the movie. Although I am not a huge fan of vulgar language, there were times when it seemed as though the translation was made for the expressed purpose of scintillation versus a desire to provide assistance to the viewer."
2,Didn't load,I was disappointed with the quality of the movie. It also stopped right in the middle and I was not able to watch the rest.
3,book,It was an okay book. It has a lot of writing and words. It was a good price though. I am happy with it.
4,Eric Sloane's Weather Almanac,"Mr. Sloane writes a week by week review noting how the seasons and the weather change as the year goes by. Mr. Sloane also notes how the weather affected early American life by the things he sees and finds while restoring his 1782 Connecticut home. The author rambles at times which simply adds to the interest of the book and gives some insight into the author's life.Also included is some weather folklore, and the scientific background to prove or disprove some of the old sayings.An interesting and easy to read book, a must have for anyone interested in weather or early American life."
5,Amazing film,"""With One Voice"" is truly one of the most inspirational productions of our time. It is beautiful to see so many spiritual leaders from around the world share their insights which ultimately point to the same place of unity and peace. Matthew Flickstein has done a remarkable job and should be commended."
5,Peace in Our Times,"""With One Voice"" is a film with an important message for our times. Mystics -- people who've come to realize the deepest truth of their spiritual/religious traditions (including Buddhist, Christian, Hebrew, Hindu, Moslem, Native American, Shamanistic and non-sectarian practices) -- speak from their direct experience about the peace that is available to each of us. This is a peace that is found within, not imposed or negotiated externally. These mystics speak about their own personal experiences of realizing this peace and that all of these traditions ultimately lead to the same truth.The film contains beautiful images and music interspersed with the comments of the mystics. It's very well done and easy to watch."
2,This guy is no writer,Putting aside all the club politics and the way this guy lived his life and chose to leave his club.What it boils down to is this is a book that this biker wrote by himself . Big mistake . All the really good biographys and memoirs I have read by outlaw bikers Like Sonny Barger's book and Chuck Zito's were co-authored by professional writers . Toby Levingston from the east Bay dragons hired the same guys who did Sonny's book to do his and you know what? It turned out to be an entertaining and engaging read. Since Ct. Ed didn't do this this book is pages and pages of droning dialogue which repeats itself and goes on and on. This book should of been edited. It does turn into a celebration of the authors own ego and self-importance. I collect books on Outlaw motorcycles clubs .This one was really lacking and lame.
1,Dont waste your money,"This guy was trying his best to do a tell all book, but its really just 'pat me on the back, I'm so great' fiction.Read this and wounder how his club ever made it without him cause he did SO much for his club. Just a loser who is pissed that his club had enough of his ego and booted him.Again, dont waste your money on this ego trip that is his fantasy of how he built the largest motorcycle club in the world with both of his hands tied behind his back standing on one foot jumping thru hoops of fire with 200 people chasing him."
2,More nothing than information,"If you leave out all the crab about travelling from point a to b etcetera and all the (who cares?) stories about his childhood, the book would be very thin.Lots of talk-talk aqnd almost no interesting info about the clublife. I expected some revenge stories but all you will read is how nice and loving the guys are. Ok, sometimes they do a little time but why the reader will never know.Sorry I bought it."
1,Not worth the time or money,This is one boreing book. This guy is out in bad standing because he wanted to be something he wasn't. This is not worth the time or money.
4,The truth,"I have also read all Outlaw motorcycle club books that are out , So this one gave Me some answers to some of the questions I had about a couple of the other books I have read, it was hard to see where He was going at times , and other times repeating what every one had already read a million times, but all in all its a good book,"
2,Tedious & Uninteresting...,"The writer needed more help in more ways than time allows to expound upon. A self serving, responsibility side stepping, well timed exploitation of the current ""Biker"" trend. Ct. Ed is indeed a smart man because he could easily see that the climate for any book about the ""Outlaw"" MC world would sell. What an obvious attempt to cash in on a mediocre personal MC history. After plodding through most of this book, (you will likely need two bottles of Extra Strength Excedrin and several pots of Coffee) it became clear why he was treated the way he was by his Brothers and why he ultimately ended up, ""Out. In Bad Standing""."
3,not too bad at all,"This is a compelling, insightful, yet laborious book to read. The fact that every club member's name is preceded by the member's club/status is clumsy at best ('Bandido Sargento de Armas Fred met Bandido Tom at Outlaw Jerry's place after meeting Bandido El Presidente Wilbur at Ozark Rider Probationary Randy's place after Bandido Dane, etc. etc.). And of course, having been written by a former member, it should---much like Sonny's books---be read as one man's interpretaion of fact as opposed to ACTUAL fact...not to say Ed's view ain't true---I'd trust him or Sonny any day of the week over a LEO or snitch, but still..."
2,Out In Bad Standings... A Little Weak,It was mostly the re-telling of the biker news that you probably already know.
3,out in bad,I read the book and enjoyed it till the last 1/4 of reading. I was a member and enjoyed hearing about some of my old brothers.The (how great I'am) did get to me to. And the BS about the president wants me gone even if someone was to kill him. This was the first book of this nature I have read but I will be reading others The brotherhood is my next one.I contacted one of my old brothers and ask him if he had read it he said no. I told him he should till I got 3/4 of the way through it. I called him back and advised against it.There are so many of the older members who could of done a better job on this type of book. To bad I didn't keep notes when I was a member. But I was having way to much fun.I was a member when Don Chambers was president Ed is just lucky Don is not here anymore. Billy
1,No MC story here,"I made myself read this book, it was almost as bad as going to the dentist.All about his personal life, very little about bikers and mc's; lots of ""I"" or ""me"" thoughtout the book. Sorry but a ""Kingpin"" this guy is not."
1,Out in Bad Standings,"I really can't add much to the reviews already stated, me, me and more of me. All I know that toward the middle of the book I started skipping anything that had to do with his job or kid. Kind of made a proud orginization look bad to say the least. As a member of a club all I know is that I'm surprised that he's still walking around running his mouth. He nothing but a little skinny wanna-be, a hey look at me dude, nothing better then a rat, a thief, a bike thief, he was/is so proud of that fact. On top of all that he mentions the names of the ""Brothers"" that still talk to him, I don't think he has any friends now! He just couldn't handle club life, punkstyle."
4,Works great,"Best price that I found on the web.The Amazon application guide didn't list my vehicle, I went to Air Lift web site and found part number then came back and ordered. They are a real pain to install but that is not the manufacturers fault. It is just a difficult product to install. It took me three hours and I have worked on heavy trucks for years and have the tools. You have to roll up the bag and stuff it through a 2"" hole in the lower A-frame. The bags are 5"" in diameter , it took a lot of soapy water and foul language. Had to cut old bags out with sawzall and knife, another PITA."
4,Great Step-by-step Instructions w/ Pictures,"I found this manual a great resource when replacing the front fender on my 1979 p125x. Though some of the technical names for the simplest of parts was slightly difficult to decifer, the pictures and helpful hints the manual gave led me through this first-time disassembly of my Vespa. A great buy ..."
1,"Leaves streaks, doesn't clean","As many have mentioned before me, this product leaves streak on your stainless steel appliances, hardly cleans any dirt. Stay away."
2,Leaves streaks,"I was looking for a green alternative to Pledge. Greener it may be, but unfortunately this product leaves streaks and has a really strong perfume odor. I'll have to keep looking."
2,Only 25% True,"My husband and I just bought a new house and therefore several new appliances. I bought this after having positive experiences with other Method products and must admit was extremely disappointed.This product does NOT actually clean the steel. When we had the fridge and hood installed there were tons of fingerprints all over it, and this product only made the already visible smudges even larger. We actually used the Method all-surface cleaner to get the smudges off and polish the stainless steel.The only thing I can that this product does is protect the surface from getting smudges once it is properly cleaned.... so only about 25% of the intended use."
1,NOT REALISTIC,"I bought this ring based on ebay reviews. It was extremely heavy. The simulants look like simulants. It's very heavy and most uncomfortable. It did teach me a lesson, however...BUY REAL! Save your money and buy something that's real. This is so chunky my 8 year-old told me it looked fake!"
1,D1718 doesn't last long,"My D1718 just recently broke. I have only had it for 4 months ... just past the 90 warranty. I would rate our usage of it as medium.The unit worked great until it broke. It seems to have good features and the video resolution is pretty good. However, it now only plays cds. Anytime a try to load a dvd it spins up, makes a bad sound, and then says that no disc is inserted. I have tried the support site with no luck. I reset the software but still had no luck. Though this unit still plays cds, I would never buy a cheap audiovox unit again. It costs too much to throw away after 4 months."
3,Audiovox is a good bargain.....,"I own a Audiovox 7"" from 5yrs ago, my kids love it, take it everywhere,but after all the abuses and throwing around, it finally broke down, still have sound but picture is gone. So it is time for new one, knowing how well Audiovox takes abuses from 2 young kids, we select the Audiovox again, for this great price. When we first receive the player, and we were not happy with the 2""by 1"" of battery that is hanging at the back of this DVD is just ackward, our old one have the battery flat at the bottom of the DVD.None the less it is great price for the light wt, thinest durable portable around, we will learn to live with it."
4,Seems ok to me,A lot of the reviewers seem to hate this item. I got it last year and so far it seems ok. I'm not an expert on portable DVD players but it does what it's supposed to do. It's probably not the fanciest one but it does the job. I wold recommend it.
1,Terrible Product,I have had this for awhile but it only worked about 4 times. The screen is too dark and unwatchable when it is on full brightness. Even in a dark room. I would avoid this DVD player.
1,AV out doesn't work,"I wanted to use this product for travel and as an additional DVD player for our bedroom. The travel portion worked fine. The problem is that I didn't attempt to hook it up to our bedroom TV until about four months after I bought it. The manual instructs the user to switch the AV in/out switch to ""out"" when connecting to a TV. Problem is, there is NO AV in/out switch! After doing an internet search, I discovered that the AV jack supposedly detects an external device and switches accordingly. Clearly, the manual should have mentioned this! In any event, it still didn't work. Nothing but static and noise.In summary, if you want to use it for a standalone DVD player, it's ok, but don't waste your time or money if you need to use it with a TV."
1,BEWARE OF OCEAN REEF ELECTRONICS,"Beware to all who purchase from Ocean Reef Electronics. I purchased a DVD player in November 2011 as a Christmas present for my Mother. After she opened the gift, she found that the battery for the DVD player would not charge. I contacted Ocean Reef Electronics, and they told me they only had a 30 day return policy and could not help me. I was told to go directly to the manufacturer to see if they would do anything.I feel it is the responsibility of the seller - Ocean Reef Electronics - to either refund or replace the product. They should have to contact the manufacturer, not the buyer."
1,Easily the worst movie I've ever seen,"The acting was abysmal, the plot was dumb, the cinematography was awful, just awful. The only interesting part of it was the scenery (St. Petersburg, Russia).I bought it for $3 at a garage sale, and even that was too much.After it was over I thought ""well, there's 2 hours of my life I won't get back"".If I could give it 0 stars I would."
4,"Yes, but...","Nice filter design. When the pitcher is half empty, fill it from the tap. This way you always have at least 1 quart of filtered water ready. You can still pour from the filtered water at the bottom, as the top half with the tap water trickles through the filter.The pitcher must be used. The filter cannot dry out, nor can the water be left to sit for more than ""3-4 days"" without replacement.I like this filter, but I also need to get a water filter that fits directly on my faucet, because there are too many occasions where it is inconvenient to get and use the pitcher from the refrigerator.Knowing when to replace the filter and where to get it from are problems. They suggest replacing it every 160 quarts (80 pitchers); or two months ..."
3,Disappointed,"I gave this item 3 stars because the material is very nice. But having said that, they did not work for me. They don't stay up very well, they bunched up around my knees and they really didn't come up that far over the knee. I think you would need to have very thin thighs for these to stay up."
2,Nice pictures but no help in restoring for judging,Nice addition to all what is out there but as stated before a lot of mistakes in accuracies.I have other books from Jim but this one was a little bit of a disappointment.
3,"Some great music, some mediocre lyrics","His guitar handling genius and virtuosity aside, Adrian Belew can write some great music. Unfortunately, on this album, some of his lyric ability needs a bit of work. Several of the songs come off as too preachy (""Burned..."", ""Survival..."", ""Brave..."") Adrian's worst lyric ever is probably on this record, the ""I See You"" lyric ""When I went to sleep in Japan, I saw your face in the ceiling fan."" Ugh.But when Adrian isn't trying too hard, he can end up with gems. ""Never Enough,"" ""Fly,"" and ""Here"" are worth the price of the album alone. The music is great, and the lyrics are simple and pointed, without being preachy or stupid.""Here"" is not quite a return to form after the disappointing ""Young Lions"" and ""Inner Revolution"", but AB is on the right track."
4,Here - Adrian Belew,Good CD. This must be the disk that got him the reputation comparing him to the Beatles. This guy is talented
4,A whole new perspective,"I just loved this book! I'm not a heavy reader or anything but I wish this book had no end. This book isn't sugar coated or anything. It's upfront and personal. A little gross at times, but funny."
4,teen input: slow start-good read,"After enjoying the movie, I bought this book for an Alternative School setting. As of yesterday (the first week) two, 17 yr old boys, have already read it. They both said that ""it starts off slow"" and ""although it wasn't a great book, they liked it and could relate to characters."" The second young man grabbed it as soon as the first finished, and he in turn read it in just one day!"
2,Way too long,"The author is a good writer, it's just that he seems to have fallen in love with his own writing. There's way too little action for a 400-plus page book. This book goes on and one and on. The Burn Journals is a much better, more intense, more realistic view of teenage depression. The romantic encounters at the end were a bit too unbelieveable."
3,"Quick, easy, predictable, but sweet.","I'm a high school teacher, and as an adult, I found this book juvenile. However, the author has a spot-on grasp of the high school mind and writes like an insider. Teens would love this book (and my students do)."
2,Ehhh.,"Well, it's better than his other book ""Be More Chill"".... but that still doesn't say much. Vizzini still has a loooooong way to go before he will write a quality book."
5,wow,Its just so... magic. I don't think you could understand until you read it for yourself. Live Live Live Live...
4,Funny in a sad way,"I just finished reading the book It's Kind of a Funny Story by Ned Vizzini. It tells the story of Craig Gilner, a fifteen-year-old contemplating suicide. Craig ends up checking himself into a psychiatric ward, where he meets people that change his life and outlook. The story deals with a sad reality about teens and depression. It shows that there is hope and recovery at the end of the tunnel."
3,"Slow to get going, fair in the home stretch","This book came highly recommended, which is part of why it disappointed me. The last act was enjoyable, and I can't think of a better title for teens interested in a real, honest presentation of depression. The end hummed along nicely.However, I plodded through the first third waiting for something, anything, interesting to happen. Perhaps it is a difficulty inherent to depressives: reading about one is...well, depressing. Which may be a great compliment to Mr. Vizzini's skill as a writer. But I was fed up with Craig Gilner well before I should have been. This is a problem for YA writing, as struggling readers often won't endure 200-plus pages to get to something better.Looking at the other reviews, I see ""It's Kind of a Funny Story"" has plenty of fans. It seems that for the right reader, this is a good book. I just imagine it is a limited audience."
4,Review,"Short, sweet, and humorous take on depression and growing up. Definitely recommended and one of those stories that you can come back to and revisit like an old friend."
4,Really a good book,"I really enjoyed it,it made me think and i found it very entertaining. I raccomand to read it to everyone."
4,Honest portrayal of depression,"I though the portrayal of Craig's depression was shockingly accurate. In fact, I think it's one of the most realistic portrayals I've read.Craig is depressed after getting into the prestigious high school of his dreams. He feels trapped by all the pressure and he's losing his focus on what he really wants. One night he decides he is going to kill himself, but instead he calls the suicide hotline and ends up checking himself into the hospital. While in the hospital he learns to cope with his depression and figures out what he really wants.While Craig's character seemed very real to me, I was disappointed by the one-sided characters in the psychiatric hospital."
3,It's kind of a sentimentally idealized story,"Disappointing. The novel's depiction of depression feels authentic, but once Craig reaches the mental hospital and (in a most implausible turn) finds his fellow patients almost universally delightful, this book really falls apart. Reading it, I felt an oppressive pressure to find these unwashed, arrogant, ranty, unsavory characters as charming as Craig apparently does, but none of them were particularly likable except for the self-injuring love interest.It is possible to write a funny yet unsentimental and unflinching book about depression. See: ""The Bell Jar."""
4,One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest for teens,"The beginning of this novel was slow, but picked up after the first few chapters. Vizzini's writing is strong and funny in the middle section of the book when Craig is first admitted to the hospital. His characters are interesting, but don't overshadow the main character, a teen-aged boy suffering from depression. I found myself skimming the last few chapters. It seemed that Craig had made some breakthroughs and the last section was a long goodbye to the friends he'd made in the hospital. Much of this was sweet, but it went on for too long. Overall, however, a great story."
4,Good one,"Buy this one if you enjoyed books like Tapping the Source, The Fault in Our Stars, Catcher in the Rye, The Perks of Being a Wallflower. If you like teen fiction or Teenage Rites of Passage, just go for it. I loved the main character's lingo. Check out his definition of ""Strings."" It's pretty good."
3,Ok,Not what i expected....A lot of theory for something creative like enterpreunership!!!!!But still Shane is the best in field
5,Integrity,This is a book about the character of a man of honor for whom failure was not an option - a very much needed roll model for our own time and circumstance.
2,GENERIC ROCK,"Hard rock? Alt-country? Indie? It's hard to tell but this sounds to me like an ordinary promo debut rock act. The guitars seem particularly unexceptional, 80s hair maybe with few creative ideas and the vocals/lyrics invoke bold cliches (why not another numbered nervous breakdown?) and mention Jesus Christ so many times I'm beginning to suspect this is Christian rock disguised as cool."
5,Best shoes,These shoes are so comfortable. There is no break in period needed for these shoes. Definitely will be buying more.
4,Good practical information,"I have worked in the field on HPLC for many years but still found a lot of useful information and hints which I had never encountered before, like peak hight and area related to pump and injector problems. Not every item may be applicable to your specific field ou activity, but the book contains much good practical infromation for the beginner and advanced chromatographer as well. It is also not dependent on specific configurations or system models and, therefore, more timeless and useful for anyone. Recommended."
5,Sweet and Funny,"Children love this book, but so do adults, especially for its theme of jealousy The cut-out cover is attractive, featuring seven Hamtaro's, based on the hamster's mood. I liked the way the plot flowed in this story, and I continue to love Hamtaro's cute sounds."
4,Unheralded but real safety item,"I enthusiastically agree with H. Connelly of Pennsylvania about this product's value in a power outage such as winter storms regularly provide to Northern California. I can't think why the manufacturers don't market it as a safety product, especially for elderly people living alone: no more searching for candles, to say nothing of old jelly jars to set them in. Adding a reflector to each unit would make it even better. Seen as insurance, it's not expensive, and there's plenty of time to recharge between storms."
1,Poor,I title this poor because it is what I am after getting ripped off by this crappy product. Not worth a penny.
2,Oh For Goodness Sake,"I got the Candella and was thrilled. It was the perfect reading light - soft glow and I would rest it on my chest while I laid in bed. A bedtime reader's essential tool. After about six months, all four ""candles"" instead of charging at the base, they would turn on and when I removed them, they would turn off. This was completely the reverse of what it should do. After a couple weeks, I just tossed them. Now that I read the helpful advice about reattaching the battery, I'd like to give it another shot, but I'm not thrilled that this little gadget seems to have a pesty design flaw."
3,Stainless Paper Towel Holder,"I like the looks of this paper towel holder and the functionality okay. Because I mounted it under a cabinet I think it hangs down a little futher than my old one. Because of this aspect, I don't like 'running' the paper towel thru the tear off space as it points backward. If I turn it around and mount the other way it would be hard to push the bar out of the way to change the rolls. BUT, that being said, I like it just fine and would recommend it to a friend."
1,overengineered junk,"Shame on OXO. This product is a waste of natural recources.Looked nice once installed, but difficult to operate, wouldn't tear consistantly, a pain to rewind, and the tab holding the crossbar broke during the first paper roll. Returned it. Bought a 'perfect tear' racheting undercounter type, love it!"
1,Do not buy!,I usually buy OXO products because their quality is excellent. This product misses the mark however. The workmanship was shoddy and it broke before it was even installed! The idea behind it is a good one but I bought the ratchet paper towel holder as a replacement and it is the best!
2,"A bit flimsy, a little squeeky..","Even when this thing is bolted tight onto the drywall, it is a little bit flimsy where the bar is that sticks out over the paper towel. It wiggles and squeaks when you're trying to pull out paper towels. It feels cheaply made. Worked hard to perfect my bathroom and I don't think this was the right finishing touch for it. I bought it mainly for its looks and smaller size compared to the higher rated Perfect Tear Chrome Paper Towel Holder."
3,Works well,"Plugged in unit and pet odor in room was cleaned up.Run unit all the time on low setting in a room 12x18,has reduced the amount of dust"
3,Love It :),"My review is more of the same if you've read the others. It works great, though it can be a little loud on any other setting than low. The medium doesn't bother me, actually. It's not any louder than my air conditioner. I'm actually getting ready to buy two more. :)"
2,Quiet only for deaf people,"This machine is really only Quiet if you have hearing problems. Seems like a factory inside, even on the so called sleep mode. My cat is afraid of the noise, in sleep mode. When put on medium or high mode, she leaves the room. It's more like a vacuumcleaner. I really do not understand how people can say that this thing is quiet in sleep mode. Comment this if you want to hear a recording of the background noise on sleep mode :)"
4,This air purifier is compact and really works..,".. and it also has an Ionizer with it. Another benefit for some is that it runs kinda loud when set on high, which helps if you need ambient noise to help you sleep. And the price is great. Only downfall is that it really only cleans a small area, perfect for a bedroom but too small for a living room etc..."
4,DeLonghi Air Cleaner with Hepa Filter,"Have not determined effectivness, as yet. Compact, eye appealing, and quiet on low setting. Have it running 23/7. Medium and high settings are on the noisy side. Nice product!"
4,What you don't see will hurt you!,"Like everyone else, I think, why spend money on another air purifier. After two weeks with this on...you'll know why. What you don't see will hurt you, and the air isn't getting any cleaner! Serioulsy, I thought the room I used this in was pretty clean, dust particles in the air when the sun shined in, but not too bad, then, I looked at the filter after two weeks. In all its gray ""dusty-ness"" their it was. For a dorm room, office, or small bedroom, this is the way to go. I have yet to get a replacement filter yet, but will without hesitation once this one has seen its days. A bit noisy on the high settings, but if you like the white noise, you're good to go. For the price, you can't beat it."
1,"""What? I can't hear you... let me turn off the purifier""","Wish I would have returned it.I know others have found it works great. I, however, found sprays clear odors better. I didn't find the air cleaner or with less odor (trying to get rid of smoke smell).And other reviewers were NOT kidding when they said it is loud on anything but low. Don't even think about listening to anything else unless you use headphones.There you have it. Hope you find something quieter that works well."
3,Five Civilized tribes,"I was looking for information on the Seminole tribe, and this book is helpful. It explains how they were relocated, but I was hoping for more info of the tribe before they were ""civilized"". Like their ancient traditions, etc..."
5,better than others,"The product works better than the pur and the brita filters that attach to the faucet. Instead of a light, I just have the replacement delivered every 3 months. I then remember to change it."
5,compact and useable,"Small filter, easy to install. last about 2 months with normal use. Water taste good when using filter. works well as promised"
5,Great tasting filtered water.,I am hooked on the Culligan water filtration system. The replacement filter lasts a long time and provides great tasting water from home.
4,Slow but solid,"This unit is installed in a small office environment to filter drinking water and water for the tea kettle. Install was easy, flow is understandably slow. Seems to filter out most of the NJ city water chlorine smell and taste. (old socks would help NJ water, so faint praise, I guess)Been about a month, no leaking. Seems a good alternative to the plastic pitcher.Hopefully it won't get discontinued soon....."
4,Great Filter,"It appears that all FM-15A filters are now made in China. I find them are easier to install then the previous ones made in the USA. The quality appears to the same as the ones made in the USA, but I have no way of determining the filter quality."
5,A filter replacement for FM15 Culligan filter,What can i say? Being the FM15 an excellent filter why not use the right replacement? excelent!!!
2,Can't get it to fit,It is hard to rate this filter because I couldn't get it to fit on any of my faucet ( it need a longer fitting) I have one morefaucet to try it on in my camper .
5,tastes good,like culligan water machine i had years ago i cant stand tap water without my filter i use ity to filter even the water my pets drink
1,Short Lifetime of Filter,"I used to swear by these filters, as they are well-rated on Consumer Reports and take the major chemicals out of our water. However, the past four or so filters I've most recently used have lasted anywhere from 3 days to a couple of weeks, before the water flow turns into a mere dribble.In calling Culligan tech support, they said it's not defective if water passed through originally. And that the average lifetime of two months varies with consumption and locale. Really Culligan, is this the best you can do?"
4,A hefty filter at a hefty price.,Culligan makes one of the better filters on the market and can last up to 3 months with periodic use but replacements can be pricey and would advise either buying in bulk to keep the average price down or buy a completely new Culligan water filtration unit that includes the first filter if the price difference is only a few dollars.
2,Great Filter but Really Slow,"I like the ease of use -- and it does a good job delivering clean tasting water (I use it to fill my Mavea Elemaris pitcher -- together an awesome combination)but my biggest problem is that after two week the water is trickling out of the faucet, as if it's been used for two months! I can't afford to replace the filter every two weeks..."
3,Culligan FM-15AiFilter Review,"Water quality after filtering seems to be fine. However,the product does not always work as intended. The stem does not always return to the off position after water is shut off. Ihave sent two emails to the given site address,but have received no response. I did register the product as directed. If I cannot solve the problem, I may return to usingthe prior filter product (Pur), even though it also gave me problems. At least Pur always called me with help and in some cases coupons for next purchase. Final decision on product will be made after I use it for several months. Their consumer relations department just does not seem to offer any help. The local Culligan store had no information about this product!"
5,"""H--e--y ! Mister C-=-U-=-L-=-L-=-I-=-G-=-A-=-N !",WHY buy the water for your home use --(I can understand if you're away shopping)--when you can buy one of these Culligan Faucet Filter systems?I suppose the showerhead filter systems are appropriate [too] if the water in your areais overly HARD or chlorinated.Great product!
5,Easy to install,"This was very easy to install. I haven't replaced the original filter but have checked out the replacement filter. It is simple to install, just twist off the original filter and twist on the replacement filter."
4,NICE......but,"If you are like me, you lose track of when you put the filter on. This last one was a bear to get off, so my husband did it. We used to have a brita that had a light indicator. I wish there was SOME kind of indicator on this one, BUT aside from that it works great and doesn't drip, fall off or any other weird thing. The water flow has never changed for us and we've gone according to my last amazon invoice, 3 months between changes. Highly recommended if you don't like drinking tap water. GREAT for the environment by avoiding gobs of plastic bottles."
5,So much better than Brita or PUR,No much to say except that this filter system leaves our Seattle tap water tasting 100% better and costs less than the competition. We drink a lot of water and use it to wash our veggies and in our coffee so our filter really needs to be replaced every month and a half. Still worth it. I find this is better than store-bought spring or filtered water. Our regular tap water tastes like chlorinated hose water so it is an amazing improvement.
5,Culligan Faucet Filter Replacement Cartridge - Great!,This is a great product! The water tastes so much better than Brita and Pur. Great buy and it's inexpensive!
2,filter replacement broke,filter replacement popped off of the filter housing and broke. Emailed Amazon and they are sending a replacement. First filter worked fine. Maybe just the occasional defect.
2,Replacement cartridge leaks,Looks like I was unlucky. These cartridges leaked when I put them on the faucet mount. The first replacement I was able to manage with some teflon plumbing tape but the second squirted water all around the sink. I plan to buy the whole unit again because it makes my water taste better. This is the only reason I would give it 2 stars. Surprisingly I dont see too many bad reviews or any that say that the replacement leaked. Wonder why.
3,Water flow slows to trickle after 1 month,"The water flow on this filter starts to come to a trickle about 3-4 weeks after use. I live in NYC. I experienced a similar problem with Pur filters so there's probably something about NYC tap water that isn't accounted for in these filters. It's hard to blame Culligan for this if the problem also occurs on competitors' products.When it works, it seems to do the job."
2,Unsatisfactory,"I installed the entire filter unit as soon as purchased.When the faucet is turned off,the unit is supposed to automatically return to unfiltered status. Due to increased water pressure by our water company,this does not happen and the local Culligan manager admits that it is a problem caused by the increase in water pressure and Culligan has not addressed the problem. I have since, returned to using the newest model of PUR water faucet mounted filter which has a manual filter control. It has far faster flow rate then either the older Pur model or the Culligan. Culligan needs to resolve this problem."
4,Replacement cartridge,I searched all over for a replacement cartridge and i finally got it on amazon. It works perfect and shipped on time. Will purchase more cartridges.
3,"Great filter, but can be problematic installing",While the filter works very well one must be very careful not to tighten it too much. I had to spend an hour yesterday taking the whole thing off the faucet and beating on the wings to loosen it enough to get off.
3,"Usually good, but this particular piece has a problem",Usually my experience has been good with the filters and I have been a regular user for over 2 years.However the last delivery the filter seems to be of lower quality since the rate of water flow is really slow compared to the past.
3,Just Good,"Filtering appears to be very good. The flow is considerably constricted, however - less than half the pressure into the faucet. Does not seem to last as long as claimed. The filter housing into which it screws does wear out; after 2 yrs it no longer holds the pressure causing the cartridge to shoot off from the housing. From the reviews I've read, this filter/cartridge probably works as well as the rest and better than most. Which is to say, not terrific, but gets the job done."
4,Culligan FM-15RA Faucet Filter,Very easy to install. So far its working fine. Does not leak or come loose andit removes the same impurities as the more expensive filters.One thing I miss is the fact that there is no indicator that tells you when to change filter. But for the price I'll just replace it about every three months.
5,Filter works,"This is the best filter i have ever used. My water used to be cloudy before i used this, really works and tastes good.. When i first use this the water comes out a heavy flowing stream, after uses--maybe only 2 months the water trickles out thin,, but it fits my sink which has been hard to fit. I reccomend it over Brita"
1,worthless!,Horrible product! Very difficult to get on and not leak. Impossible to get apart to be able to change the filter. Cheap but worthless!
1,Doesn't Fit My Faucet At All...,"I bought this filter based on the reviews posted...First...it doesn't fit my faucet as supplied. The only washer that fits is entirely too thick. My Moen faucet can't get a grip on the threads (fits fine without the washer, but it leaks like crazy without it). Can't comment on the effectiveness, because I can't get it to work. Very disappointed. I hate it when you have to fix an item ""out of the box"". Inexcusable.Seventeen-fifty shot to hell. Back to Brita pitchers."
1,Water trickle after only 10 days,"After only using this for just 10 days, the water flow is just unacceptable. I even unscrew the filter a little bit to release the pressure, that doesn't help.There is no justification for spending money on this item"
1,I wouldn't buy another one,It took an act of congress to get this thing to stop leaking around the faucet head.
5,Best water filter,"I'm a culligan water filer owner so i buy these replacement filters for it. Our water tastes great. We are saving lots of money not buying bottled water. I think Culligan is the best. We have owned 3 pur water filters, all had problem, all in a one year period. We have now owned our culligan for almost 9 months and no problems."
1,Poor Quality,"I've been buying these cartridges from Amazon for over a year without any issues. Lately, the cartridges aren't filtering the water correctly and it tastes like chlorine. I've had to order and return several times before getting a cartridge that actually works. Very frustrating."
3,water doesn't taste good and the filter breaks after a month,The water tastes metallic. Also it doesn't have an indicator so you don't know when to change the filter. The faucet mount is also problematic (See my other review on the Culligan faucet mount). Very disappointed.
2,Broke while being installed,"This came highly recommended, but the filter being replaced broke while it was being removed. And it broke the housing in the process. It never worked as promised, so we have replaced with another brand."
4,Easy to Install,I really like this filter and the replacement is easy to install. Water is so much better tasting now!
2,Good unit . . . but lifespan is too short,"I like the unit itself. Unlike some of the other brands of filters on the market this one has no problem with leakage. Also it is very easy to install and uninstall.The main problem we have with it is the very short lifespan. Most of the other products will last for 3-4 months before you need to replace the filter. On this unit the water flow goes down to a mere trickle in about 3-4 weeks.We deal with slow flow for about as long as we can stand it and then we have to replace it before we loose our minds. I'm ready to give up on this brand, but somehow, due to convenience, I just end up buying more filters from Amazon.I guess if $15.00 for a 3-4 week filter is not that much to you then this filtration system is the one for you.I'm going to try another brand next time."
2,Polypropylene filter a health hazard?,"I was researching water purifiers and was most interested in the Culligan, until I noticed that the filter is made of polypropylene, which is itself a suspected health hazard ( liver and respiratory). I would recommend reading more from the Environmental Working Group or other scientific literature readily found online before purchasing something that may pose its own risks while protecting from other contaminants. I don't know if there are safer alternatives (still looking), and maybe this is the same for other brands, but thought this is worth mentioning."
4,Do Not Buy More Than One At A Time,"Buy one at a time, and not too far in advance. Filter works well, but Culligan only warrants for 30 days from date of purchase. If you buy several (as I did) and one is defective (spurting water all over kitchen!), no real way to obtain a replacement."
3,slowest filter around,The Culligan filter is more reliable and lasts longer than the Pur or the GE filters but it is also the slowest filter in terms of water flow.
3,Doesn't last long for its price,"This product gives fairly clean water, but it really does not last long. Even though it says it'll last about 2 months, about one month into using it, the one I have runs very slowly as if it has been plugged. I would suggest going with a different type of filter so you won't have to keep buying this filter refill."
3,Culligan filter cartridge for faucet mount water filter,"This Culligan filter cartridge is an alternative for the original cartridges for my Walgreen's faucet-mount water filter (which I think was made for Walgreen's by Culligan, probably in China like everything else)but it is more expensive and it leaks."
4,Easy 2,"Install, use, and doesn't take up alot of space on the faucet.I can tell the difference between this and the Pur andBrita pitcher filter.Thanks Amazon.com for offering this product."
5,Great filter,This is a replacement filter. It works. And thats I can say say nothing wrong with it ...last two months.
2,"Slight Leak, Auto On/Off No Longer Works","This Culligan filterCulligan FM-15A Level 3 Faucet Filterand refill cartridge filter the water well, but after using it for 2-3 months, It developed a slight dripping leak from the side of the filter (only leaks while the filter is on). Also, the button that turns the filter on/off no longer auto shuts off when the faucet is shut off, So you can end up using the filter more quickly if you are not proactive about the switch."
2,I took it apart,"I took apart the Culligan and I can't imagine how it filters water. It's a solid block of charcoal (so 1 star for that) poorly glued to the top (I was able to pull it off with moderate amount of tugging) but with small gaps at the bottom which sorta explains the low water pressure and explains another person's review why his PPM test was the same with and without the filter (265 versus 265). And the only reason I took it apart was because I used this Culligan to filter water for my tea kettle and I noticed that tea kettle had become chalky white which I guess is the residual chlorine from the water which got me thinking does this thing even work? So, I took it apart and the rest is history.I highly suggest you take yours apart and see for yourself."
2,no better than the PUr for breaking,"I was sick of Pur filters breaking after only 6 months of use -saw this had a 5 year warranty so I tried it - breaks, too. I might be able to get a new one on warranty but I was more disgusted with the 5 year warranty when it is no better than the others who give a 1 year warranty and the water tastes no where near as good as the Pur. So I am going back to the Pur - if I have to throw something in the landfill every 6 months to a year it may as well be the Pur which satisfies in the meantime."
2,I so don't like the taste,"I never really like the water taste from this filter. I thought I would like it once I become used to it, but it didn't happen. I'm very disappointed that Culligan made such a bad filter. Though everything else works fine with the filter, but the taste for me is just a no-no."
5,Excellent product!!!!!!!,Compared to Brita this is far far better in terms of overall build quality and the filtering is much better. The taste of the water is very good compared to other filters that I have used.
5,Perfect Easy to use water filtration system - Easy to install,I could not be more pleased with this water filter and the replacements. The unit attached easily to the sink faucet. The replacement cartridges easily screw in and out. The water tastes good and the price is right. The filters feel weighted and solid as does the unit itself. This is a very well made product.
5,It just works!,We use well water and have some odor problems (Sulfur smells--H2S). We have no odor or taste problems using this filter.
3,Water filter,This product is okay and I have used it for some time now. I have a pup who is sensitive to chlorine in the water. This seems to help.
4,culligan filter,"This culligan filter does what I want it to do. It removes the powerful chlorine taste that my tap water has. I have changed it at the recommended two month interval, I do not know if it last longer than that. Good product.I would have given it five stars, but the reduced flow using the filter is sometimes a bother."
2,They do not last long,"After using the product for over a year, I have to admit, these are expensive to replace and they last only a short while compared to other products on the market. Not worth the price and replacement time overall."
4,Great Product Once Installation is Done,"This filter does a good job of making our previously sediment-heavy water nice and clear. We'd been using a Brita before, but always ended up with lots of dark flecks in our glasses no matter how long we rinsed the filter for. I added these to my subscribe and save so they come to us pretty cheaply and I get an automatic reminder to change the faucet. The only minor issue I had with this filter is that I personally have a lot of trouble changing the filters. Granted I'm not very strong or very handy, but for me it's a bit tough to get the filters out and the replacement in. My husband is able to pop them right out though so might not be a problem for most of you."
5,Love these!,"I thought I wrote a review for these filters a long time ago, but I hadn't!I purchased the faucet kit when I first moved a year ago. I have purchased these every two months since then.This whole filter system is great! In my opinion the system is very compact, easy to install, and use.These filters work great and I have no problem with water pressure, like I have seen some people complain about.I fill 2-quart pitchers for crystal light and tea multiple times a week and the pitches take no longer than a minute to fill up.I would buy this system for any other home I live in for the rest of my life!"
5,Works for us,"This filter is easy to install, with metal parts. Had this for about 6 months and the auto shut-off still works fine. We use it every day for about a gallon of drinking and cooking water, and I just put in a refill filter when the flow of the first one got pretty slow. The water from the first filter was still clear and fresh. The refill does leak a little around the filter cartridge, a drop out the back every 5 seconds when you use it, and removing the cartridge required some pliers to break it free. It appears to filter fine, although I have no clue how scientifically pure the filtered water is compared to straight tap. The water doesn't have any smell, and the pitcher we use to hold the water until use, is still clean after 6 months holding the filtered water."
4,culligan FM-15a filter,"Thus far this product has performed as advertised. It does remove the chlorine taste from the water, which is what I mainly was looking for it to do. Beverages made from tap water taste much better now. I am still assessing the longevity of function."
5,does what it claims,"Easy install, good value. I've been using for 4 months, no issues yet and water tastes great...no more fear of drinking my tap water."
4,exactly as ordered,this filter was easy to install and makes a huge difference in the quality of drinking water i get from my well.
1,You need the Strength of 10 Men to get off the old one!,"The old filters are next to impossible to get off. I'm a guy, weigh 225 pounds and am pretty darn strong. I can't get these off without Dynamite. You're better off just buying another whole faucet filter and it only costs a few dollars more."
4,Dons' best,"Probably Dons best movie, with beautiful training scenes, better than rocky and hard hitting action scenes. The acting isn't horrible and the story carries well. This movie has lots of fight scenes with creative twists (Don takes on a gang of martial artists that wear glass on their fists.) the bad guy hammers nails into wood with his palms. I dont see why more of his movies arn't like this one."
4,Another Great Don Wilson flick!!,"Don ""the dragon "" Wilson is a kick boxing legend. Winning 10 different world championships and proving his dragon style kung-fu was affective in the ring. Ring of Fire is one of my favorites. The plot is very well put together unlike some of Don's other films. Don only had one fight scene lasting a maximum 7 minutes. It has some great fights between what I like to call, ""the asians"" and the "" white boys"", Ring of Fire is a prety good martial arts/kick boxing film that gives you a action packed time!"
5,What a delightful book!,"Four Sides, Eight Nights is a delightful book that celebrates the Jewish holiday, Hanukkah. It's sure to please children with its wit and charming pictures, and in truth, adults will enjoy it, too. This book is a perfect gift, and I plan to give several."
1,TOO STIFF!,I have purchased these brushes for years..... by the dozens. I loved them. The maker has for some reason stiffened the bristle to such a degree that the brush isn't really usable. If I wanted a bristle this hard I'd buy a metal bristled brush! To really use a brush with a bristle this stiff one would need a much heftier and heaver handle. Way to stiff.... they've ruined a wonderful product.
5,Best dish washing brush ever !,"I tryed many dish wash brushes but the Quickie tops them all.It has the correct length, the correct angle, and most importantly the bristles are the right length and flex that does the job properly for all your dishwashing chores. Most other brushes have bristles way to stiff or soft. And the little scraper is just the correct lenth and in the right place.Once you try a Quickie, you'll throw out all your other dish washing brushes."
3,No Parts to purchase,"This nice piece hardware, however, as things mechanical, part fall off and break. As previous rater stated you cannot purchase part. This would be rated 5 star if someone could find part for. I know we live in throw-away America for anything less than $grand but this angers Oleg. I suspect someone with these rifle could recover cost of rifle by selling all part off broken one. Anyone have this??? I hope not too critical. I try for to be nice."
4,A Wonderful Surprise,"I stumbled upon this book by accident while looking for a new author. I was pleasantly surprised by the characters and the story. After finishing this book I went looking for other books by the same author and found Sister to the Rain. Both Cold Iron and Sister to the Rain are good stories that will keep you entertained for hours. I especially like the inclusion of the elves into our world. Not the typical fantasy novel. I hope there will be more books in this series. Once I get to ""know"" a character I can't wait to visit them again."
3,"Good, but there are better...","It's a reasonable head, however if you are using a long lens, you really need a gimbal head like the Wimberley. However my real issue with it is, with the head loosened you compose your shot, but when you then lock it down, it moves, so you have to start over, and learn to adjust to the movement."
3,A Good Rebus Book,"This is one of the better Inspector Rebus books -- great plot and great depictions of Edinburgh and its seedy sides. The earlier books in the series are not as great as the later ones, but they really set the stage for the characters and the tone of the whole series."
3,A step down in normal quality,"Mortal Causes was written to tell a story within a story. Rankin appears to have set the crime so that he can tell a political story in addition to the crime.The novel starts with a gruesome murder and Inspector Rebus is sent to investigate. He notices these strange letters on the corpse and this sets in motion a chain of events involving Ireland and the religious issues between the Protestants and the Catholics.Intertwined in all of this, there are personal issues that Rebus must face.I found that the novel was a good read but there were so many characters, it was difficult to keep up with them or care about them.Another issue I had with the book is that I think Rankin has his character straying from the street crime that he is renown for and entering an area that he is not comfortable with. This results in a jumbled ending that I sped through.All in all, Rankin is always good reading but this is not the best he will do."
4,good vacation reading,"Good vacation reading while on a beach. A little long winded compared to other Rankin books, but still most enjoyable."
2,Consider upgrading your coffeemaker,"This replacement carafe is exactly what you need if you have a working Braun KF400 coffee maker. The coffee maker makes a great cup of coffee but you'l notice that you can buy a new KF400 coffee maker for less than the cost of this carafe.Over the past 15 years (we really like the coffee maker!) we have gone through three of these carafes - only to have them fail or break. They dribble coffee - have a cheap plastic hinge, and are the most fragile item we have to wash in our sink every day. As some reviews state, you just have to be careful - but then most of us are usually half asleep when we make our coffee.We recently upgraded to the KF600 and love it. It has a sturdy metal thermal carafe, pours easily, and makes the same great cup of coffee. Paying a few extra bucks should prevent us from replacing anymore carafes."
5,Just what I needed,"I finally broke the carafe for my Braun Aromaster KF 420 B while washing it in the sink. I considered buying another coffeemaker, but the newer ones I looked at seemed kind of flimsy. I only use a coffeemaker on weekends or other days off, so I don't need anything fancy. As other reviewers of the Braun have noted, the auto drip stop broke off a while ago, but the machine still brews a good pot of coffee.This carafe is the exact replacement, and works great! I arrived undamaged, and you gotta love the free shipping!"
4,Replacement,It is an identical replacement to what we had. Not as flimsy as people described. I refuse to buy a new coffee maker (even if it is only double the price of the caraffe) if the one we currently have works and makes great coffee. I thought it was worth it!
1,DO NOT BUY,The carafe leaks if you pour too fast. It is fragile. Ours broken after only a couple months and was handled with care. I'll never buy this again even it's free.
1,oops!!!,"Unfortunately the item I purchased was for a newer model of Braun coffeemaker. As a result it was wider and shorter, thus unable to activate the release to let brewed coffee flow into the missized carafe."
4,Good Choice,"Very good. Works as promised. This is the factory-manufactured replacement for my 10-cup Braun KF-400 coffee maker. When the package arrived, I was momentarily unhappy to hear what sounded like broken glass inside the package. As it turned out, what I heard was not broken glass. It was the plastic spill guard that had come loose and was clanging around in the carafe (glass pot). No real damage. I would recommend that the folks at the fullfilment center snap off the spill guard and wrap it in paper before they place it in the package."
4,perfect replacement,"We have a perfectly functional coffee maker and broke the glass carafe. After trying several off the shelf replacements in stores we went on line. Amazon had the best price, the right replacement and speedy delivery. It works perfectly!"
5,Exactly the product I needed,"I had broken my Braun carafe in my last move. The replacement carafe was exactly what I needed, shipped very promptly and a lot cheaper than buying a whole new coffee maker. Very pleasant shopping experience!"
5,Just what I needed!,"Using the powerful GDI+ libraries in .NET come with a fairly large learning curve, especialy for printing. This book cuts through all confusion with elegant and useful examples. It also includes many diagrams and visual aides to help you conceptualize the various classes and properties (I wish the .NET documentation did the same). It also goes over various gotchas that pop-up in the framework or graphics programing in general, saving me hours of trial and error. The printing chapter alone is worth the entire book, especialy the example of how to word wrap text across multiple pages! This book will be a constant reference guide for me as I create complex report forms using the framework. Forget ""GDI+ Programing in C# and VB.NET"" (which I unfortuantly bought) and get this book if your at all intersted in graphics programing or printing in .NET."
3,No VB.NET code in the book,"The cover of the book states ""Project Source Code in C# AND Visual Basic.Net"" There is no VB.NET code in the book. If you want VB code you need to look on the CD that comes with the book. This is probably a big plus to C programmers and a major drawback to VB programmers. If you are not a C programmer, this book is a waste of money, because not only will you have to read a boring book; you will have to decipher the C# which can really slow you down. However, if you are a C programmer or are trying to become one, then this book is a good reference for .Net graphics."
5,Boundary Microphone,"Amazon offered this microphone at a $25 savings over ordering it from the main brand web site. It arrive in excellent shape and in only a couple of days after placing the order. It performed very well, picking up vocals from all directions with clarity and strength. Love the hands-free concept."
5,Great for tiny dog.,My chihuahua is too small for any collar I can find. This works great since it adjusts to any size.
5,Love these leads,"I have 3 of these leads for my three dogs. The quality is excellent. The coloring is fun and fresh for a leash. And, best of all, they are very easy to slip on and tighten the leather piece to keep them in place. Just love these leads!"
5,Slip Lead,"I bought this slip lead for my 12lb Chorkie. She seemed to do really well with the plastic ones they have at the groomers, but those unravel and are not a long term leash. This leash was so soft! My dog can't wear collars because they give her a horrible red rash. This leash is so soft on her neck, not one complaint from her. It also has a stopper, so you don't have to worry about the neck hole loosening up and your dog slipping out. The 6ft leash is perfect! I'm sure people are going to ask me where I got this leash!"
5,"high quality, visually appealing","I used this 4ft slip lead for training my 47lb pit bull to behave better on walks. The material is soft, but strong and the color sheme looks very nice. The leather tab is adjustable and helps to hold the leash around high on the dog's neck for better control. I also bought a 6ft version and am very happy with them both."
4,cartoon lover,"Favorite of all ages in our family. Brings back memories for the older generation, a refreshing change for the new."
3,Disappointment,"Even though it has a few good episodes majority of it is very disappointing. Do not buy this if you only like the episodes that have Bugs Bunny, Elmer Fudd, Daffy Duck, Silvester the cat, and/or Porky Pig."
5,LOONEY TUNES HAS NOT LOST ITS APPEAL!,"AS A FAN OF THE CARTOON WORLD (OLD AND NEW) I HAVE MANY LIKES AND DISLIKES. THE LOONEY TUNES COLLECTIONS ARE CLASSIC, ENTERTAINING, AND ENERGETIC. REGARDLESS OF TODAY'S OPINIONS OF WHAT IS WHOLESOME AND MORAL, LOONEY TUNES IS STILL UP THERE AS #1. I WAS RAISED WATCHING THESE LOVEABLE CARTOON CHARACTERS AND WILL CONTINUE ON WITH MY CHILDREN. HATS OFF TO THOSE WHO HAVE CREATED THE COLLECTION SERIES. I HAVE ALL OF THEM AND LOOK FORWARD TO MORE."
2,Unloading the Undesireables?,"Based on the decades of Looney Tunes, we see that the 30s were OK, the 40s to early-50s were genius, the later-50s were not great, and the 60s were horrid. One of the worst characters to become popular was Speedy Gonzales. Every episode plot was the same--think Casper or Baby Huey cartoons. Volume Four seems to be a dumping zone for every Speedy Gonzales episode ever made. There are a few rare jems such as...Rabbit Hood - 19498 Ball Bunny - 1950Mississippi Hare - 1949Southern Fried Rabbit - 1953Kiss Me Cat - 1953Plane Daffy - 1944The Grey Hounded Hare - 1949Hurdy-Gurdy Hare - 1950The question is, do the few jems make it worth buying the mine of abysmal undesireables? Could it really have hurt them to put 2 or 3 Speedy Gonzales and mixed it up a little bit? 2 stars for the gems. But that's it."
5,Excellent,"Everything was fine. My neice's and nephew's laughed out-loud. They've watched it over and over, and they laugh every time. I've watched it and I laughed."
5,"okay, hopefully this is not all folks!","here we go again folks, i know the wonderful guys at the termite terrace have given us many joyful laughs. i along many other seniors(yes, and proud of it!) were raised on these cartoons. i have purchased all these golden collections and have not been disappointed with one of them. not to say that they are all favorites but most of them will not fail to make me at least smile broadly and probably laugh or giggle. in the world we live in today we have to have something to take our minds off of terrorists,high gas and politicians.as one of the other reviewers mentioned we have to support these dvd's so that warner brothers will at least feel the profit motive for releasing more even if they personally don't care one way or another.keep buying them folks,that's all.bob c"
3,Too Much Speedy. Opting for the Spotlight Collection.,"I have the Golden Collections Volumes 1-3.They are all fine sets. A little less of the prime era 40's- 50's classic cartoons' as the series continues on each release.Sure, you'll get filler; as Warner strives to make more volumes. As long as it's reasonable, that's business.The inclusion of a full disc of Speedy Gonzales- is not useful to me. A single cartoon would have been fine. A wasted DVD in this full set.Would have liked more Daffy Duck. More Bugs/Daffy War Era too.Extras are interesting for a viewing or two. Nice, but not essential.The 2 disc Spotlight with many good Bugs Bunny will do the job this time.Warner Brothers can save me money on future sets. Be certain to include a full DVD of useless cartoons. Release more full DVD 'bottom of the barrel' on future Golden Collections.I can just buy the 2 disc Spotlight sets from now on."
5,SILENCE...YOU HAVE DESECRATED THE SPIRIT OF THE LAMP,YOU HAVE ALSO DESECRATED THIS COLLECTION BY NOT INCLUDING ALI BABA WABBIT.AND WHERE IS SYLVESTER'S...BELL HOPPY!!!THE EPISODE WHERE HE TRIES TO BELL THE MOUSE WHEN ACTUALLY IT'S A KANGAROO....BUT I STILL WILL GIVE THIS SERIES 5 STARS CAUSE I'M A LOONEY.....
5,Looney Tunes,"Looney Tues are a classic, and should be viewed by every generation! Yes they are a little racy at times, however, they continue to be the cornerstone on which many modern artist and entertainers alike build off of throughout their carriers. This is a must for anyone who is serious about cartoons or art & entertainment in general!"
4,comfort zone,"So many reviews already, just wanted to add my rating to the overall score.Love these collections. The only thing that would make them better is to make them all the main looney tunes characters and eliminate all the other warner brother cartoons.They are my standby when nothing else is on or I just need to de-stress."
2,"Looney Tunes- Golden Collection, Volume Four","This is not as ""strong"" a collection as previous volumes in this series. The packaging of the DVDs is an issue,since they are stacked one atop another. This increases the risk of damaging a disc considerably.As for the material,disc 3, is almost completely unwatchable. Speedy Gonzales on a whole Disc? Please. Disc one is the best one, all Bugs, not necessarily at his best but, it is the best disc of a mediocre lot. Conspicuous by his relative absence, Daffy Duck. But he is up to par when he does appear. Sadly, the producers had to put in a disclaimer about ethnic stereotypes. The statement was just so much hogwash. The viewer should understand that this material is a product of the times in which they were made."
4,Why Warner Brothers Choses the Cartoons that they do?,"I like most have purchased all the collections so far. I will continue to purchase all the collections as they become available. Warner Brothers is like any other business, they need to make a profit. If they put out all the best cartoons in the first 2 or 3 volumes, what do you think would happen to sales of the following volumes? That would probably end the release of the rest of their vault. Now that would be the worst thing that could happen. What would we have to look forward to in the next release? I think it's fine. They make money and I get to anticipate my favorite cartoons being in the next release. Warners Brothers is keeping our attention and making money while they do it. A Win Win for all. That's all Folks."
5,second best set I've purchesed,"I purchesed this set with volume 6 and I have not stopes watching it yet. I especily love the cat and Speedy Gonzoles discs. To me I think Speedy isoakot like Jerry, but funnyer. I would highly recomend this set to all Looney Tunes fans. at this low price it can't be beat."
4,stop using the crappy digipak!,The cartoon list looks pretty good. Why is packaged in paper?? Digipaks wear out and look crappy once used. Why not just put them in plastic Amaray box? Warner Bros. got smart and stopped using the paper snap case and switched to Amaray plastic cases. These are expensive and should be housed in something durable.
2,Bad Collection,"so happy to be able to give this review.. I grew up on Bugs and Daffy, and its awful to see that Warner would go to the trouble to petty-ly try to rip us all off by putting in maybe a total of 4 decent cartoons, and the remaining 3 discs of the ones that you would slip to the kitchen to eat something long enough for this episode to end and another to start.. shame on you.. we want a best of Bugs, and we mean the very best of one after another.."
5,I always use this product,"I always use this photo paper. I am not a professional photographer, but I do love to make prints for my many photo albums. It's quick, easy, and I am very satisfied with the quality of the pictures. Just put the stick from the camera into the USB port of the computer, pick the pictures I want, and in no time out they come from my printer, and I haven't even left my chair. Again, the Epson produces very good quality photos. Also was very happy to see that this product is sold on Amazon, my go to place for my shopping needs.Carol EdwardsCentral Oregon"
5,Love at First Sight!,"My boys are 4 and 2 years old. They loved this video the first time they saw it. ... There are aerial views of airports, many different planes and kids excited about flying. ..."
4,"VERY NICE, VERY COMFY, VERY NEEDED","BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I HAD A REALLY NICE VEST. (Sorry for yelling.) Thisis a perfect vest for my needs & am completely pleased.However, one of the vest pockets had a hole in bottom (unfinished), but I tookmy trusty needle'n thread & fixed it. Okay now, but slightly, um,irritating for this brand item.I think the price was very agreeable, the quality overall very high. Thanks."
1,This album IS terrible,"Typical altpopunk of the early 90s, a tired genre, but easily exciting when it is done right, but it simply isn't done right here. If I could give half stars, I'd give it 1.5 stars, but I chose 1 because, its not good. Sounds like guys who have day jobs."
2,Hopes toooooo high,ok if ur expecting the quality of their live album then forget it! the sound recording quality is not great and they seem to have a knack of using different levels for different songs when in my opinion the album should be constant.however the songs are generally good and some i would even go as far to say are great.
2,I feel a little skinned by this eel skin,"This wallet/organizer is very difficult to use. The frame is inflexible so it is hard to remove your currency or get at your credit cards. I bought it because it would hold all my ""necessaries"" but found out that I would need at least 1 other carrier anyway. The leather is nice and soft but that's as much as I can praise."
3,A bit disappointed,"Well done, but not anywhere close to their debut album ""Delaware"". It was unfortunate that key band memebers left and the results on this album show that (has an unfinished feel to it). There's some good, catchy tunes on it though."
1,Does not teach programming for using the Windows GUI,"If you already know C++ and want to learn to make programs that run in the Windows GUI instead of a command line, this book DOES NOT cover that. The most advanced example program provided runs at a command line ! If I had known that, I would not have purchased this book. The book barely touches on menus, buttons, etc, and does not cover how to write a complete Windows program that uses the GUI.If you don't know C++ at all and want to learn it, this book has lots on C++, but there are much better books out there for learning C++. The coverage of C++ in this book is not sufficient to teach it to someone who is learning it for the first time."
1,Buy something else,This is undoubtedly the worst C++ book I have seen. It spends so much time being cute and funny (well TRYING to be funny) that it fails to teach the material. It is broken up into many little incomprehensible parts. Each part has a name that does not tell what it is about because the authors are trying to use silly little puns for titles. Nor does the order of the parts contribute to learning anything.After reading this (well trying to read it) I was more confused than when I started. Stay away from this one at all costs. A better choice is Beginning Visual C++ 6 by Ivor Horton.
1,Don't Waste your Money,Covers too many topics in too little detail. The authors over active sense of humor and use of silly phrases and section titles makes it very difficult for a beginner to know what he is even talking about.
3,"Good, but not great.....","This book is pretty good on C++ syntax, but doesn't do much on actually getting into the MFC and Windows programming side of things. I would highly recommend Sam's Teach Yourself Visual C++ 6.0 for learning the basics of MFC programming."
1,A disappointment when compared to other books of this series,"I've had good luck with the Dummies series. The SQL and Visual Basic books provided an excellent introduction to those topics. 'Visual C++ 6 for Dummies' however, failed to convey the basic concepts. I found many typos and sentence fragments, leaving me with the feeling that the book was hastily cut and pasted together the night before the deadline. C++ is a difficult topic to teach, but even so I feel the authors could have done a much better job if they had taken the time."
3,Good for beginers. Focuses more on C++ then VC++ 6.,"It was a good begining book but you have to want to learn. And please don't buy this book for Visual C++ 6, because it doesn't talk about it that much. It's 1/3 V C++ 6 and 2/3 C++. But it's a very good begining C++ book and introductury to Visual C++ 6."
1,If you are a real dummy in C++ - don't buy this book!!!,I have started to work over the first chapter and all I got was just errors after the 6th compilation! ( It was the german translation) Instead of telling someone like me (newbe) what to do after finding these mistakes you find out that you are just on yourself... I can not redommend the german translation for a bloody beginner - don't know about the US edition Don't buy this book!
1,Not for beginners,"Disapointed.A book for Dummies should be for a beginner.If it started with a project and programs and showed how it is done and then step by step explained how and why, it would have been a good Dummies book. Instead the authers expect the reader to absorb a lot of unfamilier data without having a basis on which hang it."
1,hope hes NOT a comedian at night,"Ok. i know its called ""for dummies"".... and i dint really consider myself one, until i dropped $29.99, but, i looked at the first few chapters, and it look OK.... I thought id get much more ""Windows programming"" out of iti got a bit tired of :""see me feel me touch me print me...""""smooth operator""""holy debugger batman, it works... etc...A bit to bubble-gummy for me AND, as was mentioned before:What About Windows ???? ... id didn't buy it Strickly for c++, it said ""VISUAL c++""... maybe if it had been called ""Visual c++ console apps"", (which is what it is) i would have (should have), left it on the shelf.. maybe its my fault... i guess when i think visual c++, i think sdi, and mdi classes...OH... maybe i am a dummy, after allI was NOT amused, nor very happy..."
1,Buy C and C++ For Dummies Instead,"I completely agree with Ron F's review on this book. I already owned C and C++ for Dummies, and expected this book to take care of my ""Visual"" needs... as the title promised. The first part of their book skims over it, and then you never see it again. The authors teach you just enough to get Visual C++ to operate like the non-visual predecessors of long ago. I do feel the authors did do a good job writing the book, only the title is very misleading. I wish I had visited Amazon to read these reviews before buying the book. My bad."
4,A good way to learn C++,"I knew how to write C, but not C++ or how to use Visual Studio. As said before, most of the book just makes console apps. But I did learn a lot, working through it, chapter by chapter, in only a month. I didn't think the OOP part was ... bad ... . But the next version could be stronger if the authors would introduce more of Microsoft's extensions. In all the Jukebox applications, the SongNames & ArtistListings have to be done without spaces because the authors didn't use the CString class."
1,Incompleteness is a sin in my book,"There are always problems when trying to cover the basics of a huge environment in only a few hundred pages. However, this book is hampered as much by lack of complete examples as it is anything else. When you've spent half an hour typing in a program (a CD is provided so you don't have to type anything) and you find that there is no main() function or anything that actually exercises the code you've written that's just frustrating. Seemingly complete programs don't compile and there is just no excuse for that. This is just a poor book."
5,Got one becaused I loved mom's so much,"I've been wanting to get one of these for a while. I've messed around with knockoff's for a while, but it is time to get this bad boy. My mom has one, and I love it. With the great price, I can't pass it up."
5,Great Machine,I love being able to make two kinds of ice cream at the same time as we don't all like the same kind. Very easy to use.
5,Very Pleased-Great Appliance,"This appliance was larger than I visualized but it has worked great, is easy to use. I wish I had more recipes to try for the holidays! It has a sleek attractive look and is very well made. The concept of freezing the tubs compared to the old crank and salt method is so convenient. Don't touch the tubs with bare hands or you will get freezer burn!"
2,"OK book, nothing special","I got this book yesterday and finished it this morning. It was extremely fast and easy to read. I think Shaw wanted to keep it in the form he got it in, without grammar or punctuation. This is REALLY annoying though, and really doesn't help the integrity of this ""real"" story, which tries to come off with a moral message but doesn't succeed. Also, I kept trying to figure out if this was a real story or not, or just fake, because it mentione Christina Aguleria, Britney Spears, Madonna, and Jessica Simpson. This book was okay, and since it went fast, I can't say it wasn't worth my time. There are really great teen books out there, but this isn't an exceptional one."
5,Finally a real book!,Finally --- this book was fun to read. I am not sure it's true but I think it's real-- my best friend is reading it right now --- we love it! It should be movie I would so see it.
5,Lots of fun!,"With all of the subtle digs at ""today's young pop divas"", this book is hysterical....and a great summer read"
3,Good Product but....,"Particularly if you are starting from scratch. I converted from The Master Genealogist. The conversion went well, for the most part, but a lot of the ""events"" didn't automatically carry over which means that I have to re-enter them. But there are too many to enter as I have several thousand which means I will probably go back to TMG."
2,Not Impressed!,"I've been using MacFamilyTree for about a year now (got it as a gift) in conjunction with Ancestry.com and their mobile app. Thought I'd check to see what else is out there for Mac. Tried the demos for Reunion and iFamily. I too found this app clumsy to work with and the reports limited. Aside from the form creator (reason I gave 2 stars), which is a great idea, I don't think Reunion is worth the price. While iFamily for Leopard is the lower cost product of the three, it is very similar to MacFamilyTree and also has a good range of reports.I'm sticking with MacFamilyTree, it has great reports and several export options."
1,Super Clumsy incapable software,"I have used this software for about 6 months. It is the most clumsy software I have ever used. Gedcom handling is just barelyfunctional, transfer from ancestry.com basically doesn't work, sources get lost. Diagrams look awful. Reunion is the absolute nightmare.Any other software is better."
1,Not even close to worth the money,"I had expected above all else that when I ordered this problem for my Mac that it would be a user-friendly program, easy to navigate, more interactive, and with an elegant appeal. It was just the opposite. The program isn't one that is user-friendly nor does it have a tech-savvy appeal to it. It seemed like a cumbersome program and there was nothing in it that appealed to me. So, I sent it back immediately. I was more than have to uninstall it from my computer. This software doesn't offer anything more than ancestry.com, which I think is an excellent program. I was simply looking for something somewhat like ancestry.com which I could pay for one time and enjoy similar features. I am just going to stick with ancestry.com and any associated fees that I may be charged."
3,Don't like reports it creates,"When I bought my iMac 2 years ago, I also got Reunion 9 as part of the package. Now that I'm retired, my night time is filled with heavy research on Ancestry.com. After using Family Tree Maker for years, Reunion 9 has been very disappointing. For one thing, the reports are messy, and confusing. With FTM, I could do search and find, spell check, check for other errors, etc without downloading my gedcom. But with Reunion 9, I have to download my gedcom once a month or so, and open it with Reunion 9 to see if there are any errors. So I need a software that works with the downloaded gedcom. The tech guys at Ancestry.com say they're working on a version of FTM for Macintosh computers, and I hope they have it soon. In the meantime, I recently bought Mac Family Tree, and I like it much better than Reunion 9 for reports. It's also a lot cheaper than Reunion 9."
5,Review of Reunion 9,"I have been using Family Tree Maker on a Windows machine for as long as 15 years. Although I was very used to it and satisfied with it, I find that Reunion beats it hands-down with the additional benefit that I no longer need to use two computers."
4,Reunion 9,"Reunion is nicely designed, with many more options than GEDitCOM, but it costs twice as much and is not twice as good."
4,Works Well on Mac,"Not as user friendly as Roots Magic, but works well on my Mac. Also, for LDS users, you will find it does everything you need. Totally satisfied with this product's performance on Mac, and I've had difficulties finding a compatible program."
3,Bad to the bone...,"Set in the early 19th century, ""The Strange Woman"" takes place in Bangor, Maine, where logging and lumber mills have made the town prosperous. Jenny Hager has grown up in Bangor, not far from the watchful eye of wealthy Isaiah Poster. The fact that Jenny is twenty years Isaiah's junior does not stem his amorous intentions, and when she's finally out of her teens, Jenny accepts his proposal of marriage. But beneath her sweet exterior, Jenny is a shrewd, conniving women, and while she makes a fine life for herself with Isaiah's money, she obviously doesn't care for him. When Isaiah's son Ephraim visits from college, Jenny is immediately attracted to him. And Jenny's scheming doesn't stop there. Nothing and no one seems to be able to stop her - not even the thought of murder."
2,Save Your Money,"I recently purchased 3 of these containers. I gave it two stars only because I know that glass is much better forstoring food and drink than plastic. However, I purchased these because of the air tight lids but the lids were junk. Two fell apart right away. One I managed to put back together but the lids would not hold their seal. Save your money. The time and effort it would take to send these back is not worth it."
4,Good size for refrigerator,"I bought this to put non-dairy coffee creamer in. My husband doesn't like the containers that don't have a plastic pour spout and the best, least expensive creamer doesn't have one, so I tried this pitcher. It's the perfect size and shape, fits in the fridge door. I would give it five stars but the design of the top is not very practical, spilled the contents because my husband didn't tighten it down. It should pour without losing the lid."
1,How a $7.95 Pitcher from Amazon Cost You $15.94,"If you put a ""juicer"" in your cart, Amazon will suggest that you also buy this pitcher. If you buy this Pitcher with other items eligible for free shipping, pay close attention. Amazon will sneak in a $7.99 shipping charge that is not eliminated from your final costs.At Amazon's $7.95 price, the pitcher is OK. With the shipping cost snuck in, at a total Amazon cost of $15.94, the pitcher is grossly over-priced.Potential buyers beware."
2,Waaaay too small,"Realize that you can't put a spoon in this to stir anything, and it's basically the size of a large cup. I realize that it's my mistake that I don't know what 1.25 qts is, but when I got this it was so skinny that I couldn't believe it was real. Also, you can't even put your fingers between the handle and the pitcher, they're too tight. I gave mine away."
3,AR-7 Advanced Weapons System,"I picked this book up to view any modifications or add-ons for my own AR-7. The info here is somewhat out of date (of course, it was printed in 1990), but I still found it useful in knowing what I could expect to find out there. Most of the diagrams in the book, in my opinion, would require some gunsmithing experience. The are several pages of photos, and all of these where great."
4,Great attitude.,"While this item is mislabeled, the vendor has the kind of integrity and concern we wish all vendors would have. When I complained about the mislabeling of the product, the entire amount of my order was quickly and apologetically refunded. I wouldn't hesitate to do business with him again."
1,The Truth will out,"I wrote the plays attributed to William Shakespeare. I admit my dates don't match up and I have no documented evidence, but I can produce the most important artifact to support my claim, something nobody else has. I have my original manuscripts and I will willingly submit examples of my handwriting to prove I wrote the plays. Believe me, I am the author of the plays of William Shakespeare."
4,Kudos to the Chi Lites,"I have been a fan of the Chi Lites since I was a kid. I remember hearing ""Have You Seen Her"" and ""Oh Girl"" over and over again. My mom/ dad were BIG Chi Lites fans. In fact, I remember a picture that my mom took w/ the group when they performed in Tampa, FL back in the early 70s. I must admit that I had never heard ""Hot on a Thing"" until this CD. Man, talk about a nice groove...the minute I played it, I was sold on it. It has such a nice melody and great words too. I have since played the song for two good friends of mine, and they too have been sold on it. This song will definitely be played at my next ""Bluelights in the Basement"" house party!!!KEG"
4,College text book turned great read and resource.....,"This was a requirement in one of my MBA course and while I was irritated that this was book of four required for the course, I have found that it was a good read, easy to comprehend, and ended up being a keeper. It has some good information for daily issues found in management or management-like roles."
3,Complete DVD Season Box Sets,"The few episodes that Time Life released are ok, but this show deserves being released in complete season box sets on DVD. Hopefully this will happen in the future."
1,most disappointed,"Very simply, I orderd the product in good faith thinking Amazon screened those vendore with whom they did business. the item never was received and the independent vendor never delivered the product. I will not order on Amazon again. I've had no asssistance in resolving the matter, nor for that mattter only a passing of the buck to the vendor for whom they claim no responsibility. Not a good standard or model to continue what has been avery sucesssful online franchise. I will accept responsibility for not having known now about Amazon's operating pprocedure. However, you live and learn."
3,The show is awesome. The DVD...,"I absolutely love TWKUK, but the problem is this DVD is presented in a matted 4/3 format. That means, the video was shot as 16/9 widescreen, but they reformatted it as 4/3 so those of us with widescreen TVs either have to look at a video with big black borders or zoom in to crop them. The zoomed video isn't unwatchable (like those Star Wars special edition DVDs), but I shouldn't have to take that extra step.Just something to know before you buy."
5,WKUK; LOVE 'EM!,This DVD is a mood lifter. I have not laughed so much since the release of the first season. I almost peed my pants; PEED! Don't wait another minute to purchase your copy!
1,I hate this book!,"This book had a misleading title! I thought by the title it was instructional, but it is not in any way! It is about the history of sex. Thumbs down all the way!"
1,Repair shop knows my name!,"This laptop's hard drive was defective out of the box. It was replaced. Then the keys started popping off (I have them held on with bandaids now), now the CD-ROM drive won't read discs. The computer is 8 months old, and used for word processing and the internet. A total dog. Don't buy it. (sorry dogs, for insulting you!)"
1,Waste of money,I bought this computer as a home computer. Not really looking for a laptop but the price was right. It work for a month then the hard drive just died. I bought a bigger sized one and worked ok for a few months more. One day i came home from work (my mom had called and said that she needed to use it so i had let her) and the darn thing wouldn't turn on at all. My boyfriend who fixes computers all the time looked at it and said the motherboard was fried. What?!?!? I knew it was a used laptop but to work for less then a year and the thing die? I went a bought a ACER laptop for the same price brand new and haven't had any problems other then Vista drivers for it. Don't buy dell crappy crappy crappy parts and service.
2,Hints of the writer-to-be....far from his best work,"Since I first read Garp I've been a huge fan of John Irving. I've pretty much loved everything's he's written since Garp. I had left his first three books for last. I think Water Method Man may be his worst (which is not to say it's bad...it's not. It's just not up to Irving's very high standard). After reading this, I gave it to my wife ( a voracious reader, indeed, and also an Irving fan). We agree. The biggest problem here is that we just didn't care about Trumper or anyone else in the story, for that matter."
2,Sloshing through the Water-Method Man,"I am a fan of John Irving but was unimpressed by this book. Although the Fred Trumper character was developed fully in the usual Irving fashion, he was ultimately unendearing and dull. Coupled with an unmomentous plot, the lack of an interesting protagonist made for a dull read. While The Water-Method Man had moments of truth and insight, they were just that: moments. Overall, a semi-worthwhile read."
4,Understanding John Irving,"John Irving, as a young man, starts off with a bang. His first chapter is an hilarious incursion into a very unpleasant situation. Officers and enlisted men in armed services around the world will knock themselves out laughing. But then, somewhat characteristically although certainly his Cider House Rules was well organized, he wanders here and there. However, as my favorite Irving character, Jillsy Sloper, explained, I just had to keep turning the pages to see what was going to happen.The Water-Method man is much more organized and better written than Garp and miles above those dreary bear and Vienna stories. And we can understand Irving's expression of pique with editors and others who hold a writer's destiny in their envious hands, for that is how I understand much of Garp to have been.This is a must and most entertaining read for Irving's male fans. I don't know how the ladies will regard it--probably not charitably."
5,Perhaps Still His Best Work,"In 1981 John Irving told me that after five novels many people still thought The Water Method Man was his best. Now it's 19 years later and perhaps it's still true. I don't mean that it's his most elegant or deep novel -- but it has an element of optimism about humanity that is purer than in any of his other work. I laughed out loud more when reading this than any of his other books -- and I'm a big fan of his; I like all of his works. In the end, who cannot help loving and sympathizing with poor Fred Trumper, bumbling his way through love, death and honesty as we all do?"
4,Worth the read,"I rarely hear people talk about this book when discussing John Irving, but it is definately one of my favorites. The story flows well, the characters are easy to relate to, and the story is hilarious. I highly recommend this book."
2,Disappointing . . .,"If this had been the first Irving book I'd read, I would not likely read others. This was a somewhat dis-jointed read; I never connected with any of the characters or cared much for their fate. I can somewhat dismiss this as an early effort by Irving & stick to his more recent works."
3,Irving creates the template for his furture great books.,"Everything that John Irving fans know and love about his books is in this sad and funny story about a man with a messed up penis (a symbol for his messed up life?). Everything thing, that is, except for the magical ingredient that made his later novels great. Still, this is worthwhile reading for Irving fans interested in seeing where it all began."
1,"Awful for most, horrible for Irving","This would be an awful book for most writers, but for a talented artist like Irving to print this garbage is just sad. The book jumps back and forth from the past to the present, he goes in and out of fantasy without noting which one you are in. The old lit piece is out of place all together.This is my fourth Irving book, and I was so disappointed I will have to will myself to read another."
2,"Okay, mabye I don't get it","I read all of the wonderful reviews of this book- and after being thoroughly pleased by his much later work- Prayer for Owen Meany- I felt I surely couldn't go wrong. All I can say is ""WTF?????""- and for those who don't know what that means- just look it up. This book was written in the 1960's so maybe it was the age of the psychedelic drugs that influenced the writing- but I have no idea what Irving was getting at in this book. In addition, though I'm no prude, I wouldn't dare let my wife or kids have a glance at this book- I can see it getting banned from many libraries."
1,Only book I ever wanted to trash.....,"I got a little more than half way through John Irving's book and I couldn't stand it anymore.If your into toilet humor and bad taste, this one is for you. If this is one of Irving's better books as some of the reviewers have stated, I wouldn't touch the others with a ten foot pole. I depend a lot on the comments of our fellow readers before making purchases, you guys let me down on this one."
3,Not His Best,"If I had read this book first, I would never have read all the other wonderful things from John I's brain. Yes, Trumper was interesting and pathetic, but the overall story got more and more boring. I sympathize with his penis problem. All I could see as I read it just recently was Robin Williams, Robin Williams, Robin Williams. Has this been made into a movie yet."
4,water method man,the book was in good condition. I could not find a decent copy in any library in my town.
4,John Irving,This book made me laugh out loud. I don't know why this one did not get as much notoriety as some of his other works. It's a good read.
2,So-so Irving,"I've read several books by Irving, and I recently finished ""The Water-Method Man"". Quite a disappointment, after reading the magnificent ""A Prayer for Owen Meaney"". This was Irving's second book, and you can see the beginnings of ""The World According to Garp"" in some of the characters and situations. There are some extrememly funny moments, though, and the jumping from 1st to 3rd person points of view, and from the present to the past, in each alternate chapter, is amusing. However, the first half of the book is hard to slog through, with chapters written as letters -- an annoying contrivance. It's also hard to follow what's going on, or why we should care about these characters, at least until the episodic plot is set in motion at the half-way point of the book."
3,i probably made the mistake of....,"reading ""the cider house rules"" and 'a prayer for owen meany"" before reading this book. i enjoyed both of them immensely and ""the water method man"" was somewhat of a letdown. the book jumps from year to year and back again in the life of fred trumper. sometimes, i found myself reading halfway into a paragraph before i realized that the story switched to an incident that occurred years ago in the main character's life. the storyline is not as entertaining as the other two books i mentioned but it grows on you. if you are a die-hard fan of john irving, then you will want to read this book. if you want to experience the best of irving, buy the other two books that i mentioned."
2,"Bad, but good enough to finish.","This book has no REASON. Not like logic-reason, but like a reason to be. It is hard to follow, the plot jumps from first to third person and travels through Bogus's life in absolutely no order, and the characters are dull, there is no plot, it is BORING and you don't care about anyone. It is not funnier than Garp or Owen Meany, no matter what anyone says. (and, for the record Garp IS better than Owen)"
2,"The revival of American Spirit following September 11, 2001.","Life magazine always produces great pictures and this is no exception in this book. The book is a compilation of the life of America following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The personal stories are always the best to read about. There is a personal background of five people who survived the attacks and this is very poignant. One detailed a young widow of a NYFD person killed in the attack. She described the payout which she recieved as a victim as our ""sad money"". These people will never be the same as a result of the attack.I find fault with this book because there is so little focus. It descibes personal stories, then goes off to talk about the ex mayor, then looks at Afghanistan. There is a series of writings in here about the American spirit, but there is no focus in even this. This is a hard book to follow, so I rated it low. The editor should have focused on one trend."
3,Lacks focus.,"While this book was not intended to document the events of Sept. 11th, a reader would expect the book to show the impact the date had on the American People. There are a few things wrong with this book. For one, it makes an honest attempt to show how Americans were changed by these events yet, at times, it deviates by documenting events post-9/11 that had nothing to do with the terrorist attacks. There is too much focus on NYC and little on Washington DC or Pennsylvania. Emergency workers in NY share their stories yet nothing is written about the passengers aboard the planes. Recognition is given to one pilot but none is given to any of the flight attendants. It is nice to see that in this day and age, we Americans are proud of our country and are willing to defend it but what Life had failed to show was the true reason for such patriotism--we are angry over ALL events of that day Not just over the attacks in NY."
4,Top 50 Review,Short Review: I did enjoy this video as it's a great mix of old and new superstars put together which was probably done on purpose as not to bore some of the younger newer fans. I do think that this video is worth watching but I wouldn't want to watch it more than once as it only showcases a superstar for a few minutes.Overall I would say its this video is a good way for wrestling fans to get a very quick history lesson of the who who's of wrestling and if there is someone your not that interested in then in a couple of minutes there will be another that you will be interested in.
3,"A raw and bristling preview of ""Speed is Dreaming""","St.Johnny's real blowout record was the follow-up, ""Speed is Dreaming"", now sadly unavailable due to the (typical) distribution antics of Geffen. But for the price, this is well worth having, moreso than the overripe, very different third album ""Let it Come Down"". This band had an awe-inspiring retrograde guitar dynamic whereby rapidly strummed chord progressions start to gel into languid, even downbeat, drifting harmonies rather analogous to the optical patterns seen in the spokes of spinning wheels. The only guitar band that surpassed St.Johnny in this curious blend of restless and listless moods was Swervedriver.Strange lyrical ruminations, occasionally reflecting Beat literary sensibilities, are sung in a high, nasal voice which is not pretty, but works quite well with the music. What a pity these guys are gone! Track down ""Speed is Dreaming"" if you can."
5,Black bat,They provided me with a brand new bat free of charge after sending me the wrong color initially. That was great recovery service.
5,Excellent for longer-distance temperature measurement,"I have a UEI DT302 digital temperature logger with dual inputs. When I need to measure two process temperatures simultaneously and the measurement points are far apart, I can have difficulty connecting both thermocouples to the DT302 due to the short wire lengths of the thermocouples. This Fluke extension kit provides an excellent solution. It is somewhat delicate and so must be handled with care, but temperature measurements are very accurate when connected. The only ""con"" is that it is provided as a roll of thermocouple wire and two loose mini-connectors with no detailed assembly instructions. I have posted wiring preparation and assembly sequence instructions above in the ""View and share related images"" section. Hopefully this information will be helpful to folks unfamiliar with these mini-connectors and thermocouple wire."
2,"Love the hardware, hate the preloaded software","I have used this Vaio for about three weeks now, and have been quite pleased with it's performance. Everything has worked as it should. The main problem I had was simply adapting to Windows Vista. However, this computer comes with so much useless preloaded software! I probably spent two hours clearing away all the AOL, CNN, Corel and other trial programs just so I could feel like it was my own computer.The hardware is fast. The RAM is abundant. The battery lasts for a very long time, which is why I chose it over other laptops. The screen is sharp except for viewing it from an above point of view. The built-in wireless hardware is fast, simple and reliable. The case is lightweight, yet not too fragile. I love good product design!I will use it for design presentations and on-the-road design work. I would still purchase this if I had to do it all over again.**Item severely malfunctioned after 18 months. See comment below."
5,"Excellent, light weight,cool look","This is really an excellent laptop!!!...It is quite light weight, the keypad is elegant and with orange linings the look is great!One hiccup is that if you need to join a domain, you need to upgrade it to Vista Business/Ultimate, which is more money and effort.Sometimes the battery heats up a bit more...otherwise a great stuff!!"
1,Horrible. Hard disk crashed twice in last 10 months. Sending it second time to get it replaced.,"This is a horrible laptop. Looks good and sleek, but is a piece of junk. My hard disk crashed twice. First time was within two months of purchase in last May. It crashed again today, and have just now got off the call with Sony support. Need to send the laptop to get the disk replaced. Thankfully it is still under waranty. Never buy a Sony laptop. They are over priced and not at all reliable. Also this model heats up real bad, tat you cant place it on your lap after half hour of use. Also the attery drains of in little more than 2 hours. It could probably be because of Vista, but I am totally disappointed."
5,Excelente desempeño,"Excelente desempeño, se apaga con una rapidez inusual, la interface gráfica es muy buena, el teclado es grande a pesar de lo pequeña que es la maquina, y muy potente para conectarse a internet, compra recomendada"
4,Theda is the movie!,I can see why Theda Bara was so popular. She dominates the movie. A very good movie for those who are interested in silent movies.
3,ROAD?...SAVE IT FOR THE ROAD,"ALTHOUGH TOM'S SLIDE GUITAR IS GOOD, MOST OF THE SONGS HAVE NO REAL ""MEAT"" TO THEM. TOM IS ACOMPANIED BY A RYTHM KEYBOARD WITH A DRUM MACHINE('NUF SAID?). MOST OF THE NUMBERS ARE LONG AND REPITITIOUS. THE CD IS OVER AN HOUR AND, WITH 13 TRACKS, EACH SONG AVERAGES A LITTLE OVER 5 MINUTES. THERE ARE NO VOCALS ON THE CD....JUST LONG, REPETATIVE JAMS....ESPECIALY THE FIRST 3 TRACKS. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A FEW PRETTY GOOD NUMBERS AT THE END OF THE DISC, THIS CD COULD ALMOST BE USED AS A RYTHM PRACTICE CD. IF YOU ARE GOING ON A LONG ROAD TRIP, YOU MIGHT WANT TO BRING THIS CD TO PLAY IN YOUR CAR. THAT'S WHAT I'M SAVING IT FOR. JERSEY SLIM"
5,multi tasker,the quality of this product surpasses your expectations. the price is a great value since the glasses are individually marked with the chess pieces and can also be used for checkers. the product comes in its own storage/carrying case.
2,What a shame!!!,"What a waste. It's terribly filmed and aimless. It also suffers from shoddy editing. Harvey Keitel is great, I don't think I've ever seen him in a bad film. But many charachters, such as the one played by Michael J. Fox, are only seen for a few brief minutes. There is no narrative, this movie is shameful compared to it's predecessor. I understand the directors wanted too do an ode to Brooklyn, but why, oh why, did they have to do it around a sequel to smoke?"
3,I love New York but i prefer Brooklyn,"Paul Auster is a new yorker, is even more than that, a ""brooklyner""!Discovering ""Blue in the face"" you will enjoy Park Slope, the Brooklyn Cigar company, you will even cry for the stadium's closing;and you will remember the favorite hobbie down there: the plastic bags chasing...In a mixture of professionalism and amateurism,cinema and feature reports, Paul Auster, at his best as a movie director, will touch you right in the middle of the...brain."
3,Great headset but bad for price XD,"pros:Comfortable,These headphones do look nice, though, and the packaging they come in is extremely nice.the first time sound horrible for bad adjusted my sound card settings,but after some tweaking XD ,now they sound AMAZING.cons:price$$$,The mic is poorly designed and ineffective(sux)"
1,Falls shorrt,"This is Razer's bastard child. It's a piece of junk, and so is the audio card. Low quality and rushed production seem to be the theme with the combo. These guys are lucky that I forgot about this when I purchased my Naga, or else I may have never purchased another Razer product again, which I think is now the case.They should send everyone who bought the combo a free Mako to say sorry."
4,Good headphones,"These headphones are good for gaming, but the design is not exactly what I expected. The volume controls are on the left side, so if you are right-handed it may take some getting used to. The sound quality is good and they are comfortable."
4,Razer HP-1 Barracuda 8-Channel Gaming Headphones,"I have to tell you I really love the sound and the comfort, but after only a few uses the support strap was pulled out of whack. So my only complaint is the flimsy construction of that strap, I still use them mind you, but that damn strap irritates me."
3,Great sound - good looks - but what is up with those screws,"As you can see the reviews are mixed with these headphones. Audio quality is always going to be subjective. I think the headphones sound good compared to most mid range 'phones. For game play and movies the `phones give you a great directional 3D effect.But construction is not subjective. Either something works or it does not. Either it stays together or it does not.I love these 'phones, but I have had to return them twice because various parts stop functioning, such as the mic or a speaker. But the worst part is those ridiculous microscopic screws that hold the actual earphone on to the headset. It is impossible to find them when they fall out. You have to disassemble the earphone to re-install the nut inside. You can't locktite them in place, and no hardware store on the planet has a flat head screw that small.So I love these head phones as much as I hate them, and that is why you are going to see mixed reviews."
1,Another dissatisfied reviewer.,"I have to agree with the other reviewers who have been dissatisfied with this headset. The first problem with mine is the mic wouldn't stay put. It's removable and just plugs into the left ear piece. It seemed like it would always move around in use and I was constantly having to readjust it. I also had problems with the sound balance. The right ear was LOUD while the left could barely be heard even with the left volume at 100 and right volume at 5. The center channel didn't seem to exist at all. Lastly, they were large, clunky, and uncomfortable to wear for any length of time. I finally exchanged them for the Razer Piranha headset which I really like. Not all the bells and whistles as the Barracuda, but they are light and comfortable enough to wear for hours, function well, and sound pretty good."
1,Would not recommend,"I purchased the HP-1 headphones and was very disappointed. I could never get the microphone to work correctly, even after returning it to Razer for a different headset. It took Razer one month to exchange my original headset. Entirely too long in my opinion. I'll look at products made by other companies than Razer from now on."
2,Breaks easily,"My son really likes the sound of these headphones, but the left earpiece snapped off after less than a year of use. It broke at a really thin connection point made out of what we used to call ""pig-iron"" or ""pot-metal."" It's a weak, brittle metal amalgamation that's not suitable to withstand this kind of localized stress in a tiny little cross section.On the Razer website, the support FAQ for these headphones says:Q: Can I request or purchase replacement parts for my Razer product?A: Razer does not currently supply any replacement parts.This situation may not be improving soon. I noticed they're not hiring anyone in development or product support, but they do have an opening to replace their Marketing Director. (sigh)"
2,Not worth the money,"Good sound, although a slightly ""tinny"" sound on the rear channel. Compared to my last set of headphones (Turtle Beach HPA2) these just couldn't hold a candle to them. They feel cheaply made, and while they are quite a bit lighter, I just didn't like the feel of the in-line controls or headphones themselves.Also, there is no way to have both this headset and your normal speakers hooked up at the same time unless you can find line splitters. I wish I would have know that before purchase.I ended up returning these after the mic stopped working less than a day after they arrived. While not bad, I can't honestly recommend them considering what is available at the same (or even lower) pricepoint."
1,This headset sucks!,"Usually Razer products are above average in performance. but the Razer Barracuda Gaming headset didn't do any good. and if you wear glasses the headset pushes your glasses into your temple, causing bad headaches. hope someone finds this review useful -Gube"
1,No Power,Just received item in the mail today.There is NO power when plugged in.Returning Headset for a replacement.I will post again on my progress...
3,Headset Review,The Headphones are good they have great sound but they are advertised as directional. I play online shooter games and was hoping that these headphones would help me pinpoint the direction I am being shot from but they fail in that catagory.
2,Good gaming headphones bad build quality,"After 2 months of use with the headphones the screws fell out from the earmuff holding it with the headset. it gave me good positional audio in Counter strike but the build quality should be better, i expected more from razer."
4,"Look great, function....good","Begin to hurt ears after 4hrs plus of continuous use, however the blue lights look great and match perfectly with...Razer Mantis Gaming SurfaceRazer Deathadder MouseRazer Tarantula Gaming KeyboardRazer FTW!"
1,Should be pulled from Razer's lineup,"I read some earlier reviews on this product saying that it breaks easily and is cheaply made, but i thought i would give them a shot. Well, it's a shame i could not even do that due to the fact that the first set i received broke within one minute of use. I listened to to music, sounded fine, got into a game of counter-strike and poof, the right speakers blow out. I was extremely frustrated and sent them back and asked for another pair, i just received them not 10 minutes ago, i listened to music for about 5 to make sure the speakers were ok, when i logged into ventrilo to test the mic, the bloody thing doesn't even work. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
1,Razer Barracuda headset mic isn't worth the price paid,"First off, I don't mind paying good money for a product. For a gaming headset (headphones w/ mic), the Razer Barracuda set leaves something to be desired... due to its fragile mic.I had my Razer Barracuda headset for less than five months... and then one day the mic simply quit working. I hadn't changed a thing on my OS/computer during that time, nor had I abused my headset. I come to find out... numerous consumers have had problems with Razer Barracuda mics. For the money I paid, I expected this headset to have lasted much longer than five months. To this end, I rated these headphones with just one star and would not recommend them to anyone (for any price over $20.00). Why $20.00 you ask? Because... I have a generic headset that I purchased for $19.99 three years ago... and it's still going strong. ;)"
1,Worst headset I have ever owned.,"I'm a gamer, I go through a lot of different headsets. Its been a while since I have purchased anything other than the cheap 20$ headsets, so thought I would give these a try along with the AC1. Got the parts in a timely fashion, installed, to find out no one could hear me on ventrilo, as the mic volume was so low (this is with mic boost on and level cranked to max). The boom is so short, its a good 3-4"" from the side of my mouth. The advertised LED logo's didn't work either. After some support with Razerzone, they suggested I send my set back to get another one as maybe the amplifier is broken. I get the new set, and they have a short right out of the box. Going to try and return these for some Zalman's or similar."
2,Word of warning,"Unfortunately I have to agree with some of the negative comments made by others. My Barracudas arrived with the same sort of flaking insulation on the cord, including a small patch of bare wire. As this was easily covered by a little electrical tape I thought nothing of it, until the headphones died entirely after maybe three hours of use. Amazon was great, gave me a full refund; I also e-mailed Razer to let them know about the issue, they did not seem very concerned (or surprised). So, buyer beware, the production control on these is apparently pretty uneven and you may get a lemon."
2,I really wanted to like these...,"... but I'll be returning the third set in a month. First set headband broke two days in. Second, microphone didn't exist (as in, literally removed that tiny cap on the tip of the extension, and there was no little mic inside) and the main volume control knob started going crackly, where you have to pinch and squeeze and torque it to get all channels working. Third set, microphone existed, but the sound quality is wretched, just utterly wretched. And yep, the volume control is now giving out just like the first two. During the brief periods that it's actually functioned properly, the sound was quite positional and fun for gaming, of pleasantly acceptable (but not audiophile) sound quality. Not to be confused with product quality, which this puppy comes up short on after even the third try."
