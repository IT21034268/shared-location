3,Kind of far-fetched,"I like Rhys Bowen's books, but this one got a little far-fetched with too many turns in the plot.JGR"
3,In Dublin's Fair City,"OK, more of a romance/mystery. Not very exciting, but was intriguing. It will be interesting to see her next book."
5,Ideal for students of metaphysical spirituality and healing.,"In Healing Communication: A Psychospiritual Approach, Rick Phillips provides the reader with a roadmap to enable us to heal and empower or emotional self by expanding the consciousness of communication and healing blocks to its flow and expression. Guidelines and inspiration for expanding the very foundation of our relationships through communication are clearly laid out so that we can successfully deal with our sense of separation and the harsh judgments or feelings of isolation and disconnectedness engender. Healing Communication is highly recommended reading for students of metaphysical spirituality, alternative medicine, and Psychospiritual healing."
1,Not Paul Mauriat BUT Paul Brady,"This album is actually by Paul Brady and NOT Paul Mauriat. It is unfortunate that this error has surfaced on Amazon. I got my Japanese friend to check this out - he ordered the CD to make sure it wasn't a Paul Mauriat Orchestra listing, and the artist is Paul Brady.I will write to Amazon soon and let them know of this mistake.HornetAUSTRALIA."
5,Dis is da bes kine book fo all da locos in Hawai'i fo read,"dis book really wen express what da many generations in hawai'i go tru... it also wen show how da yonga generation talk to each oda and what their families had fo go tru... if you really like know what hawai'i is, rather than believe dat we stil stay living in grass huts, and wear coconut bras, read any book that Louis-Ann Yamanaka or any other hawaii writer wrote for the true flavor of our islands."
3,Saturday Night at the Pahala Theatre,As an islander this book was easy to relate to. The book has quite a bit of pidgin in it. But still great.
4,A beautiful book,"I read this poetic novella for a course on Asian American literature. From my point of view, it made the entire class worthwhile. Rarely does an author portray the reality of the character's experience as accurately as Yamanaka. Her writing is raw and emotional. Please, take a chance and read this book!"
5,My son's absolute favourite!,"This book was suggested to me by a sales assistant in a bookstore and was she ever right!This is a book my 21-month old 'reads' (either with me or on his own) again and again, and he laughs the whole way through it every time!He's memorized which animal is in each hiding place and can just about recite the entire book without lifting the flaps, and enjoys it even more when I make the animal sounds to go with the pictures!I've bought copies for my friends' babies, and we now have copies at each of the grandparents' houses as well!"
3,Where's Spot by Eric Hill,"Part of one page was missing. When arrived, mbook was bent. love reading the book to my granddaughter. Good reading. Where's Spot by Eric Hill"
4,Spot,my son loves to open the flaps and name the animals that are behind the doors. only problem is he is getting strong enough to rip them off.
2,Infomercial!,"If you're looking for a general understanding of a cars cooling system, this is the book for you. If you are looking for any cutting edge information, or actually want to do any design work, this book is not for you. It is light in its technical information, and doesn't really give enough information to actually undertake a design project (you can always resort to trial and error, but you can do that without buying a book), and at best it merely points you in the right direction. Worst still, it seems to have been pretty much been sponsored by Evans Cooling, and spends more time extolling the virtues of their products than it does educating the reader. There aren't that many books about cooling systems out there, but this is by no means a bible. At best its a good introduction, a casual light read, at worst its academically dishonest, packaging an advertisement as technical material."
2,Not what I expected,This is not helpful at all to anyone it seemw to be just long book promoting evans cooling never heard of it anyway waste of money dont make my mistake
1,thank about it..,"i bought this charger for i700 samsung pda phone.when i used this at my car.charging was ok, but phone was off.that means when i charge the pda, i can't use the phone.it so bad..."
2,Not great,"Having heard the track ""This bitter land"" from this album and ""Sober"" from their next release I expected more from this album. Unfortunately ""This bitter land ""is the only track I like at all. It is certainly an original and interesting sound they have, but not a great album for my taste."
4,great slow jams,"this soundtrack is very good. there were only about 3 songs that i would skip. ginuwines new one is great, the deut with glenn lewis and amel larrieux is awesome. Love Session - Ghostface Killah (feat. Ruff Endz),And We - P. Diddy, Black Rob, Big Azz, Ko-Kaine, G. Dep, Foxy Brown, Craig Mack & The Mighty Ha, and Ben - Lil Kano were the only ones i wasnt feeling. i really liked i will see the movie next week."
3,Not bad but not excellent.,"After watching the movie, I was enthusiastic about getting the soundtrack because the music sounded excellent. Unfortunately not all the songs from the movie are on the soundtrack. Although this soundtrack is good in its own right, it wasn't what I was hoping for."
3,not bad but heard better,not a bad cd if you feel this kind of stuff that is wish I ce Cube put some jams on here though but hey if you ain't on bet or mtv ain't nobody trying to hear you.
4,Transformer excitement,"I hadn't seen my grandson so excited, when I gave him this Cybertron transformer. He played with that more then anything else, and just couldn't stand to go to school and leave it behind.There are some small parts that are easy to loose, and a key did get broken pretty quick. He is usually very careful with his toys too.But it sure did make a nine year old very happy."
4,hours of fun,This was a gift for my 6 year old son. He really loves it and enjoys the challenge of transforming it. He does need some help with it but parts move easily to help him figure it out without breaking it.
5,Great toy! Challenging and entertaining,"We decided to get this toy in spite of the bad review we read on this site. We also consulted with a ToysRus employee, who pointed out the fact that this is has the highest level of difficulty.My son is 5 years old and had been asking for it after seeing it on the Transformers website. He was thrilled on Christmas day when he got it!It took him less than an hour to figure it out, except for the head though, since you have to use the special ""key"" the Primus comes with to push it down. After my husband showed him how to use the key, it's been a breeze for him to transform it back and forth. He loves it!I'd surely and eagerly recommend it."
2,Pretty cool looking but........,"don't buy! My [...] year old was dying to get this toy for Christmas & was thrilled when he received it!! We immediately took it out of the package and transformed it from the Primus Figure into the big globe shape (I apologize that I am not more familiar with what the globe is called). We did this once following the directions step-by-step and when we attempted to transform it back into the figure a small piece located next to one shoulder snapped! It is broken, although not beyond use, but I had a crying [...] year old on Christmas who has barely played with this toy since. I would not recommend purchasing the Cybertron Supreme."
3,Why read the obvious?,"What makes the reviewer think one has to read a book to review it? Deekpak spends a lot of time on the TV book promotion trail talking about his latest masterpiece -- a cashing in on the tragedy of others sorrow. Now it seems the author has leaped from the specific tragedy of 9/11 to the generalized tragedy which inflicts the six billion souls on the globe. That he has found a new garb for his garu tongue adds little to the price of sweat in China. That world suffering never diminishes is probably the best evidence not to spend time with these heavily spaded up fields of soothing herbal salve. None of the readers can point to any specific, verifyable first aid this book has provided for their wounds. Writers who take out a lease on wearing the garu hat never offer any authenticity to their generalized claims of relieving life's agony. I think the five stars are to soothe their own pain."
5,If You're Dealing with Loss This is the Book,I found this book after losing a good friend to mental illness.nuff said.
3,were smaller than I thought they were going to be.,I thought they were larger. My grand son loved them anyway. I would buy them again.the grandkids loved them in the bathtub and also in the swimming pool.
3,"Nice toys, but quickly mildewed","Purchased these a while back for our kids, and they loved playing with them in the tub. However, like many other bath toys these grew mildew inside after a year or so and had to be thrown away. We've had some that for whatever reason never became fouled up, but these particular dinos seemed especially prone to building up mildew inside."
2,"Cute, but you only get 4","These little dinos were cute, but I, too, only received 4 instead of the 5 that the pictures and desciption show (there was no yellow one). I will be returning them since there are other sites which also promise all 5 dinos for a cheaper price. Very disappointed!!!"
3,"cute, but mildew badly","These are very cute little bath toys, and my 2 year old daughter has LOVED them, but four months of regular use has led to the insides being completely covered in mildew/mold stuff. The squirter aspect has been somewhat disappointing, I find them hard to get water into and out of and although it has gotten a little easier with time my daughter still can't work them herself (and I think it's this inability to easily squeeze all the water out that has led to the mildewing)."
2,4 is not 5!,"I ordered this set for my son and I received a set of 4 NOT 5! There was no yellow dino and the package it came in says 4 while the ad says set of 5... I don't know where the fifth came from in the picture, but they need to advertise correctly!"
3,Rosie Volume II ... too Edwardian for me ...,"I'm really into Victorian erotica which is more geared toward illicit couplings and meanderings, and, much more of a pursuit, capture and submission type of erotica. This volume, really hit the Edwardian erotica style and the sex is just plain 'up front' hurried and continuous ......If you like a book that does have as it's main theme the unbounded coupling of a still young girl then you'll enjoy this one .... but I certainly didn't like this one as much a Volume I .... a book I might add with the same title on Amazon ....Sorry Rosie I'll not make it to Vol III never mind no IV"
3,"indestructible, but not fun.","This ball is certainly indestructible, but my dog doesn't seem to enjoy it very much. We have hardwood floors and the plastic ball is extremely noisy on them, whether it is rolling or bouncing. I'm afraid it will roll into a wooden piece of furniture and make a dent in it, the ball is so tough. The only thing my dog can do with this 6"" ball is roll it around. She can't get her teeth around it, so normally she doesn't want anything to do with it. This would probably be a fun ball for outside in the grass if I had gotten the smaller version. Even though my dog is a medium-large sized dog, the 6"" ball is just too big."
4,excellent,"I got this for my dogs. It's a very good toy, but my particular dogs do not ""play soccer"" with it, and it's too big for them to take in their mouths, so in my case use of ""Best Ball"" is a little limited. Also, this company takes a very long time to ship merchandise, and is not good about communicating with those who have ordered. But the merchandise eventually arrives."
5,LOVE THIS BALL,"My dog loves the best ball!! It's his favorite toy ever! He has all three sizes. They are strong, durable, he has so much fun with these balls."
5,Tinker Bell is a Hit!,"My granddaughter is three years old and I purchased this for her birthday as she loves Tinker Bell. There was a problem and the blanket did not arrive when it said it should have already arrived, but...when I emailed and asked about it, Pat was wonderful! She answered my email immediately and was stunned herself that it had not arrived. She said she would overnight it and she did! It arrived right on my granddaughter's birthday and we were all very happy. The product is wonderful and the service is great! I will most definitely order again."
3,Wrong Size,Ordered this product because it was listed as a little larger than the standard envelope but to my disappointment the size is no different than a regular one. The size listed in the description is incorrect.
5,excellent product.,"amazing quality, this cable goes all the way from the living room of my house to my room, and it works flawlessly regardless of the variation of temperatures, here is pretty hot, and so far no problems,"
4,The epic continues...,"I happen to be quite a fan of big, sprawling epics, no matter what the medium may be. ""Lone Wolf And Cub"" is certainly turning out be quite an interesting one indeed. Continuing the plot from the previous volume, samurai-for-hire Ogami has been seperated from his son Daigoro during a brutal attack by his former masters, the Yagyu. As we begin this book, Ogami is on the search for Daigoro, but on his way he will run afoul of assassins and lone samurai. This volume lays out some great stories, as well as new developments in the series that will keep me reading indefinitely. For those unfamiliar with the series, it's best to start back at the first volume. For me (entrenched in the series already), this is another piece in Ogami's search for vengeance and another piece in the big puzzle of Lone Wolf And Cub."
1,Not worth it,I purchased two of these units and neither one has operated properly. They will not charge completely if at all. Do not waste your money on this product.
2,not crazy about this book...,"over-written with adjectives...and has some preachy paragraphs inserted here and there as if by an all-seeing being that don't quite fit, and also the premise of the two grandparents from opposite sides of family seemingly falling head over in heels in love in an instant, years after initially meeting, is very hard to swallow...and their conversations verge on the sickeningly sweet...sorry, i wanted to like this book as i liked another by same author, but just did not..."
5,"A light-hearted,fun & entertaining novel about family tensio","This novel follows the paths of a family full of underlying tension because of marital disharmony, and infidelity. The novel centres around an illicit relationship which evolves between the parents of the quarelling couple.Fun,humourous but also sensitive,the book leaves you immediately searching for other Lambert novels."
5,Did someone say d20? Is it better than WEG? YOUR CHOICE!,"This book is really great, and can be really fun for RPG fans. It's really your choice as to if this RPG can be better or worse than the WEG version of the Star Wars RPG. In some ways, I think this RPG is better. A few cons of it are that: - A low level character has a better chance not to hit since a lot of the time, he/she can get a 1-12 where an attack roll won't really matter - Battling is less random since there is a fixed initiative, no initiative rolls like in D&D I think this book is MUCH more detailed than the WEG RPG, but WEG RPG is also lots of fun for poeple with a low budget. Wizards is kinda forcin you into paying lots of money for the ENTIRE experience. If money isn't a problem, this is a GREAT version of the RPG, and you might have lots of fun playing it."
3,Excellent place to begin.,"This 3rd edition of Star Wars is flashy, colorful, and catchy. The system is very easy to grasp and moves quickly. The only catch is the starship combat rules. These bog down quickly. Hopefully upcoming releases will update this. Overall, I'd say this is an excellent choice for beginners and youngsters, but fans of the older editions may feel shortchanged."
3,"Good game, bad book binding job",The kids love the book and the game but the pages are falling out after having the book only two weeks.
1,The Destruction of the SWRPG,"What can I say? WOC has done it again. They have gone and ruined one of the most flexible and fun role-playing games in history. If you really want to enjoy a Star Wars RPG go find West End's Edition at a used bookstore. Basically WOC has has written their there very own GURPS. D&D=GURPS Fantasy. Star Wars=any GURPS space titles. Too many rules get in the way of the story, and the story is what is really important in RPG Campaigns. Can you really have fun as a player if you have to keep referring to Alien Table 4 in the Table Annex on Page 34 in Chapter 4? No. Give me the old D6 system, good friends, and good beer."
1,"I give it 1 star, and that's generous","Wizards of the Coast seem determined to become the Micro$oft of the RPG industry with mass marketed mediocre products - post D&D3 anyway. Their attempt at a Star Wars RPG completely misses the feel of the setting. WEG's old game remains vastly superior in every way save Prequel Trilogy info. When I play or run Star Wars I don't want D&D3 in space, which is what they've produced. It also doesn't reflect well on them that they produced a book for the Dark Side immediately after the core rulebook. Aiming for the munchkin market, I'd say. If you're after quality gaming, avoid this at all costs. Pick up used WEG Star Wars instead."
1,"Sure it's a visual treat, but little more!","They (Wizards of the Coast) have done some good work with the revision of classes, skills and feats. They even added a lot of pictures of equipment and weapons.It seems that WOTC has a problem understanding all the e-mails they have been getting on changing the star fighter and vehicle combat. The book is basically the same as the first print I bought over a year ago.Unless you've got money to burn don't bother! WOTC has failed the Star Wars Role-playing fans again!"
2,Not worth the money.,"While this book clarified things and helped the Jedi become more like the movies it left out all the Episode 1 character stats. It also did little for equipment, vehicles, starships and Droids. Furthermore, it left me knowing that there was going to be another revised edition after the next movie. Why buy it now if I will need another book in a year?"
3,Warning This is An Old Version,Just a warning to anyone who is looking at buying this supplement. This is the first version of the D20 Star Wars game. There has been a revised 2nd version of this rules system (which appears to be sellingfor much less than this version to boot). So I strongly suggest that you look for the Revised version of the rules instead.
3,It just doesn't fit,"Star Wars: RPG illustrates the problem with the d20 concept: one-size-fits-all just doesn't work in gaming. Space Opera is fast, furious, and exciting. Playing out Star Wars style combat with the clunky feat system is just the opposite: tedium. Find a copy of the WEG book - it'll cost you a fraction as much and provide much more entertainment. If you want more ""realism"", then try GURPS:Space, it's much more adaptable.The book DOES look nice, I'll give it that much."
4,This is worth your money,"Being a newcomer to the Star Wars RPG world, my experiences are rather limited but I have indeed played both the new d20 system and the old West End Games d6 version. Personally, I prefer the d20 system based out of this book; it seems neater and more dynamic. It also seems more current. Hopefully, some serious resources will come out as far as ships and equipment, etc., and this particular system will have everything it could require. I suggest this book for any RPG lovers."
5,Goof Proofer - A guide to english usage/non usuage,"Not only informative but also humorous. Thin, small and effective. Great for any middle school, high school, college student or anyone. You're never too old to relearn how to correct these goofs."
2,We Need To Be Able To View The Right Pages,"I tested myself reading the story but don't know if I need this book or not. If I was able to sample a view of the answers to the test story, on page 84, to see if I need this book or not, I might have considered purchasing it!"
2,Not real carbon fiber,This item is NOT carbon fiber as the name / description suggests. The price was fair enough for what I got but I will not buy from the seller again because of the deceiving description.
4,...,"It's such a shame that Douglas Adams left this world before his time. Perhaps he would have decided that an autobiography on his life would be a good idea. Because while, without one, we can get by on books like ""Wish You Were Here"" by Nick Webb, nothing quite replaces Adams' own voice.Webb writes the biography as well as can be under the circumstances. He has obviously gone to a lot of work interviewing and getting information from the people Adams worked with, was friends with, and knew growing up.Read ""Last Chance To See"" first, for a first hand account of some of Adams' adventures (plus, it may just be his best book!)... then pick this up to read. The breadth of the information is astonishing."
4,"Poignant, Surprisingly Informative, Funny and Douglas-ish","A worthy addition to any library containing the rest of Douglas's books. Since his untimely passing, I'm afraid this is as close as we'll come to reading any work even remotely reminiscent of Douglas. Nick Webb does a great job, manifests prodigious levels of research and has a similar sense of humour to Douglas. It's a sad read, despite being funny, but I'm loathe to finish it - I've been stuck on the last few dozen pages for months now - because when I do, it's over.Cheers Mr. Adams and thanks for the effect you've had on my life."
3,Great Fit And Price,I needed to replace my failing fan clutch on my Envoy and decided to replace the water pump at the same time because the truck had 125k. I went to Auto Zone at first and went to buy there Duralast pump but when I spun the pump it had a flat spot so I asked to try another one and it did the same thing so I tried a Bosch pump from another store and it spun smoothly. I installed the new Bosch pump today and the pump seems to be working great. This pump came with a metal gasket just like the OEM one and it does say on the pump that if you don't replace the fan clutch at the same time the warranty might be voided so save your receipts if you buy you parts from different suppliers. ( UPDATE ) 11/16/12 The new pump has failed and is leaking from the bleed hole but it is under warranty I hope the next one last for more than 4 month's. I took away two stars because of quality issues.
5,"Appears to be of good quality, installed nicely, fit just like stock.","This is a good looking water pump, (for those that care) and gave me that warm fuzzy feeling when I opened the box and inspected its quality. I bought a remanufactured water pump from the auto shop but returned it. Did not like that it had some rusty liquid on the vanes, that I could and did wipe off. I thought that if there's rust now.....well my cooling system is still very clean and I am not about to introduce any rust or fail-prone parts to it. This products looks and feels good, comes with metallic gasket which I installed with thin line of RTV on both sides. Do not want to have to do a water pump job twice due to leakage! Waiting to let the sealant dry before filling car back up with antifreeze. Will post more if any problems arise in near future. It also carries a warranty, lifetime I think, can't remember right now."
2,"Once great, now not so much","I had a pair of last years gloves. They were great. They were comfortable, fit well, and were very durable over a year of yard work and home repairs. They finally fell apart after a year and I was happy to buy another pair of gloves.This new set didn't even last until January. In the winter my gloves don't get much abuse. I wear them as I use my snow blower and I wore them when I was doing some light work on my car. The new material on the thumbs shredded and disappeared after only a few weeks and the Velcro enclosures on the wrists do not stay attached.I liked my old product so much that I wrote CLC hoping that this was a bad batch and that I could exchange these gloves. Unfortunately, I never received a response.Once great, now don't bother. There are better alternatives."
5,One of the best gloves around,"These gloves are great for working outdoors. I wear them when cutting firewood, hauling brush, and doing general maintenance and gardening. They are the only gloves that last a decent amount of time without tearing. The reinforced fingertips are great. I have an average size hand and the mediums fit very well. No bagginess in the fingers, so it is easy to grip tools, and to work with fencing and wiring. The gloves are machine washable but LINE DRY ONLY! Yes, I shrunk a pair... These are really great gloves!"
3,Decent but wear quickly,"I liked the gloves and could handle smaller ovject with them on, but the fingertips wore out very quickly."
3,historic but not that great,"this is a collection of recording not great one over the years,different incaration of the cro-mags,many times no parris,no mackie but pete hines at the kit.doug holland,john bloodclott,harley,rocky george,ex-bad brain members filling in nothing in the dvd as far as band members is solid but If you like it dose cover alot of ground but don't expect too much it's not much more than historic the way it was shot and sometime the proformances are not very good either I'd recomend the final quarrel it much better done and the harly's war set is quite good."
1,Book Full of Errors,"This was a required textbook for a graduate-level project management class I am taking. Unfortunately, it is full of mathematical errors (Our professor pointed out 4 errors during one class session alone!). The other major downfall to the book is that it is heavily skewed toward an engineering perspective of project management and does not consider a business approach. I have had better financial textbooks explain formulas to use when calculating future and present value of cash flows in a more straightforward manner than this book. If you must buy this book, buy it used and save a few dollars."
3,Many Errors,"The material contained in the text is generally well written and well organized, but beware of using it as your only source of information. There are an unacceptable amount of errors in the text which can lead to a very frustating learning experience. The authors do a good job of incorporating many real-world examples into the text which helps the reader to avoid becoming bogged down in theory."
1,Worst book about Project management,"The authors didn't go through in details how to calculate Present worth, installments, etc.Before using this book, it is better to read Principles of Engineering Economy textbook."
1,This is not the book.,"If you want to learn project management or get better at it, don't read this book. It brushes over important concepts and spends and inordinate amount of words attempting to describe the profession. It assumes detailed knowledge, gives very poor examples and, in summary, is a total waste of time."
5,B+,"Really enjoyed this classic FPS. Hardcore gamers wont be disappointed. i highly recommend purchasing. Graphics are great, story-line is solid (and not so short) , audio is excellent and the price is right."
4,Has the same problems as a movie sequel.,"Cate Archer returns in a game that's bigger, more advanced, and yet somehow less fulfilling. The original NOLF was so funny because it ran in it's own universe, the sequel is very much aware of it's sixties references and pokes fun at itself at the gamer's expense. Lots of memoes/conversations pointing out the impractiality of how a secret criminal organization would work, a bad guy who returns in the form of his empty house, and so on. My worst peeve was the spawning bad guys, which wasn't good if you're stuck in the map and running low on ammo.Some originality saves it, such as a ninja sword fight in the middle of a tornado, and the settings in Japan and India. The mimes, however, were a missed opportunity.Overall I still liked the game, and the improved game engine made a somewhat more immersive environment, but it lacked the charm and originality of the original."
3,No One Lives Forever 2,"- Possible Monolith's (the people behind this game) strongest side in game making is their wierd sence of humor and the Lithtech engine wich is being developed by their sister company.- No One Lives Forever 2 is a great game, and have everthing what NOLF 1 had plus more. Alltough, its not perfect. The storyline wasent so great as the first game, plus the final release of the game had incredible many bugs... I suggest you download ever darn official patch you can find for this game wich fixes thosse bugs. Oh... Another thing, the game requiers a strong computer. Make sure your system is way over the requierments before buying the game, cause the Lithtech engine is a unnessacery heavy engine. But, all in all, i was very satisfied with the game..."
3,NOLF 2 Revisited,"I played this game a couple of years ago, but decided to play it again ... it was ALMOST as much fun the second time! The graphics are now getting dated, but the play is pretty smooth and the audio is good!"
2,Reboot City,"Love this game, but hate the glitches. I have to reboot my computer after every gameplay session. Like many others who have written reviews, I too just purchased a brand new computer, yet still have problems making NOLF2 run smoothly. I hope Sierra is listening! Back to Vice City, which runs flawlessly."
4,Who is Cate Archer???,"Nicely Done Litech! I thought for a brief moment, the $10 I was thinking on buying birth control with was wasted, but thanfully I was mistaken! After a slow start, the story gets interesting. This is one Game where even if you play it in cheat mode, it wont help you much. Which I got frustrated with at the beginning, but then, actually let me play the game for longer! From Graphics to Sound, this game has it all. Value for Price? - you CANNOT go wrong!I hope the put out a Part 3 to this series! For those of you who spent $50 on Doom 3, hows your computer holding up stoopid!?"
5,One of my favorite games EVER!,"I love first-person shooters (stealth or no stealth). I love James Bond-style stories. I love humor. I love great graphics.Therefore, I love this game. I will say that the first couple of levels are a little slow, but once you get out of Siberia, it is a blast. It is just the right mix of stealth and action. Yes, there is one of the ""don't get seen"" levels, but it's not really too difficult and it is pretty short.I haven't done it yet, but this is one of the few games that I can see myself playing through a 2nd (or 3rd) time.The multiplayer is a blast as well, especially if you get a few friends together for deathmatch. There is something really satisfying about shooting your friend with a glue bomb and then taking him out with a flaming crossbow bolt.If you liked the first NOLF, you should love this. If you thought that Contract JACK was so-so, you should enjoy this much better."
1,Worst ever,"this game has more bugs than any other game I have played, the music stinks, I think part 1 was much better, I think you should wait for 3 and pass on this one."
1,Wost ever!,"I bought this game hoping it was like NOLF 1, it was a disapointment! totally, the graphics are great, but it has too many bugs, ever since vivendi took over Sierra they have been releasing awful copies! I would get Max payne instead!"
5,Cate the Great!,"Another great Cate adventure! This time around Cate Archer's voice is performed by Pam Grier ( or maybe ex-football great Rosie Grier?). Anyway, take the adventure where Cate foils mimes, eats liver, baths the elderly and even takes an SAT exam !! Not for the faint of heart !! Buy it BEAAATCH!!"
5,Seqeal to the game of the year!,"This game is great! It has some of the best graphics and the levels are huge! The singleplayer missions are fun and long. It will keep you playing for hours! The only thing that is CURRENTLY wrong with the game is that the multiplayer isn't the best but an upcoming patch will add more features to it and there is no editor out for it yet. But the developers say it will be out really soon! O yeah dont buy this game if you are a action only gamer, go get unreal tournement or something. Dont get me wrong this game has tons of action! But just like other spy games there is about 5 levels that dont have much action it. This game is a most own for anybody who has a pc!"
4,Read this first,"I agree with everyone that the game is superb, blah blah blah & all the hype!But just a reminder:NEVER RUN THIS GAME ON A POOR MACHINE!you will need a very fast machine to see the game in perfect action.I think the game's requirements is a bit HIGH.For example they(the developers) suggest you use a Pentium4 for High details.Yeah like i can afford that!"
4,Not quite as good as the original,"This is a pretty good sequel to the first No One Lives Forever, though it lacks the cohesiveness of the first and just isn't as funny and original. Plus, some of the levels are overly long and the skill system is a little strange and annoying. Still, it's a great game [even if I can't get it to run on my latest system.]"
2,Sequester Sequels?,"-Pros: Improved user interface and streamlined game play.Cons: Poor performance, lacks the goofy charm of the original.Overall: Less experienced gamers may like this, but die-hard NOLF fans may find it a second-rate second helping. Did someone in Marketing direct this project?"
4,Wonderful item,"We bought this for our kids to put the new addition to their hamster pet family. It was easy to assemble and the kids love it! I think the hamster loves it too. It's easy to carry and more importantly, easy to clean. It's taking the rigours of movement from my three year old quite well. I would recommend this product."
4,"Geat value, if a little dry.","If you're serious about enlisting in the military - or simply want to change your assignment - check out this set. It's very well done, and gives a nice overview of what you're going to see on the actual ASVAB or AFCT. It even covers those weird Assembling Objects questions that are on the test now. Granted, it's a little expensive, but I think it was worth it - it certainly boosted my score. I figured it was a relatively small investment in my future."
3,VHS shortcomings,"The VHS product is in very good shape and was delivered promptly. However, I had forgotten how outdated the technology was for VHS tapes. There is no way to easily jump from one part of the tape to another, there is no table of contents, fast forward and rewinding are your only options. However, all the content is there if you are willing to spend some time going through the material. The price of the tape is dramatically less than the DVD."
3,paint chipped after 1-2 years of normal use,"Good idea if installing a single hole faucet in a 3 hole sink, but after a year or more of normal use the white paint began chipping away."
3,EMBRACE UNIQUE CHILDREN:READ THIS BOOK!,"Are you a parent,teacher,caregiver or anyone that interacts with children ? If yes then you need to read this book.The Active,Creative Child,Written by a real expert;a real parent.Vlahov offers a different perspective on children that would otherwise be blindly labeled as ADD/ADHD or other related disorders.It is not only a heart-warming story of her interactions with her own son but a hands-on,practical guide to help understand and appreciate all children for the amazing individuals they truly are. As a behavioral therapist I use this book to aid in my own work with special-needs children.It is a simple,easy read that packs a lot of information in a minimal amount of pages. What speaks to me most of all is Vlahov's message that children should be examined by their dreams not their diagnosis."
2,Very preachy,"This book has a grand purpose, but I'm not sure it's the best resource out there. It starts out with an eye-opening introduction and then goes into a chapter on what is the Internet. Unfortunately, it explains it in very simplified and generalized terms. The next chapter explains the dangers present, which is useful information. The third tells what not to do when surfing on the Internet, and the last tells what one should do on the Internet to ensure a positive experience. Unfortunately, the book's tone gears it toward a younger audience than it appears to be made for. Few elementary students would pick up a non-fiction chapter book that sounds like it was written for their first-grade siblings. They would probably also be turned off by the pictures of computers which look like they've been around since the 80's. I would recommend a book that covers this topic in more depth and with less of a preachy tone."
4,Superman Anthology,It's an awesome collection for any body that truly enjoys a good superhero movie. Give it as a gift or keep it for yourself.
1,Disc labels in Spanish? Package Review,"Has anybody else experienced this?The box sleeve is as expected, but all the disc labels are in very small 5pt Spanish around the edges with no disc title and with Spanish rating emblems.Am I supposed to insert each disc one at a time to figure out which one is which?When I figure out what's going on I'll revise my rating and this review, if appropriate.On another note, I watched 'Superman Returns', to see if it was region locked, with my Oppo-83 and the picture definitely showed color compression (non-smooth gradients) in some scenes. Audio was OK.Another reviewer said they got a free ticket to go see the new Green Lantern Movie, I didn't - where is the quality assurance."
5,Awesome,"After reviewing some of the other reviews, I almost did not order this box set. I'm glad I ordered this anyway. If you are a Superman fan, you will love this box set. To see this in blu-ray is just awesome. I don't know if I lucked out, but I'm truly happy with my purchase."
5,A Must Have!,"This collection is a must have for any fan of the Man of Steel. Seeing this films in stunning HD picture quality and sound is unlike anything you have seen before. With Superman and Star Wars on Blu-ray, the decision to upgrade has already been made!"
1,Returned item,I returned the item as it was not the version of the item that I requested.I received the All Zone UK version instead of the US Warner Brother Version.
4,"Bonita presentacion, pero baja calidad de imagen","Agradeciendo a Amazon por la llegada de mi producto a Perú en buenas condiciones y en los plazos antes de lo establecido... Sobre el producto, tengo que decir que no colmo mis expectativas por la imagen ya que es similar al de un DVD la remasterizacion es muy mala, entiendo por ser una pelicula antigua, bueno lo compre por que es original y en formato de coleccion, asi que para los coleccionistas se los recomiendo, ya que esta en español... lo vere con mi hijo de 4 años para enseñarle peliculas de mi epoca..."
1,No what was advertised,I too received a non-US version. I think it might even be a bootleg as the quality of the video barely looks better than up-converted DVD to me. I will be returning this immediately.
1,"so, to get the original theatrical releases on Blu Ray...","You have to buy EVERY superman movie? Including 3, 4, and Returns, which are terrible?That's really sad. The Theatrical Cut of Superman is an iconic classic, but the extra stuff that Donner added (the cheesy Lois Lane jokes, the lame ""action"" sequence at Luthor's lair) really detract from the original.Sometimes cuts are good cuts.Now, you CAN'T get the original theatrical cut of Superman, unless you have an old Laser Disc player. The original cut was BETTER. Better flow, less stiff bad jokes, and act three really cooked.I will NOT buy all of these terrible superman films, just to get that original Superman cut. I'll wait."
5,Let it grow on you,To all those who gave this a mediocre to poor review... spend some more time with this album. I admit I was a little unimpressed at first but one day driving home on a cold and rainy Chicago afternoon I decided to give it another try. The album hasn't left my CD player since. The album is one of Llyod's most beautiful and heartfelt. The only problem with it is that it is 39 minutes long. Once the thing has a hold on you... you never want it to end.
4,Subdued but excellent,"This has not come out of my CD player since it arrived in the mail. Similar to his last (Etc.) but with more nuanced and innovative production. Does anyone record guitars better than Lloyd Cole? The melodies insinuate themselves in your brain, and the lyrics are top notch. Lovely even down to the case design. He's not going to move a lot of product with this quiet affair, but such is the music biz today."
5,Fantástica madurez,"No puedo compartir la falta de entusiasmo por este CD de la anteriores reseñas . Creo que la carrera de Lloyd Cole ha sido fantástica desde su primer disco con los Commotions hasta este último,es verdad que su música se ha ido haciendo cada vez más minimalista y preciosista ,todo suena bien ,limpio .Music in a foreign language sigue la pauta de su trabajo con The Negatives pero a un nivel mucho más intimista ,solo su voz ,mejor que nunca ,su guitarra y piano y poco más . Es cierto que el disco es breve ,pero no sobra ninguna canción y se mantiene la emoción desde el primer hasta el último corte ."
2,a mediocre 39 minutes from lloyd,"The irony is that this is not a foreign language to Lloyd. He knows self pity and half-assed efforts as well as anyone. True fans (the only ones left) will love Lloyd anyway. He seemed to be on the right track again with the negatives, but this is no ""don't get wierd on me babe."" He is still one of the best singer/songwriters around. We just hoped for more. At least Neil Clark is still around to help."
3,Practical Japanese for the Hotel Industry,"i'm beginner, is abit too difficult to learn from this book..should sample the book.that only my feedback,don't take it in mind. Thks!!"
5,I LUV CRAIG FERGUSON!,This one is his BEST yet. I'm a LONG time fan & a Craig Watcher. If you like his Late Late Show on CBS you will LOVE his videos even more. Craigy LOVES to 'cuss' & he has a flair for it. I'd listen to him read a phone book & die laughing.
3,I was surprised,I have seen Craig perform twice and read his books...I was surprised at the tone and language of this performance. I still like him ...just bought copies of his book to give away.... He did warn that he likes profanity and would be profane...so...perhaps it's all on me.
1,"For The Love Of God, Make Her Stop!","For The Love Of God, Make Her Stop!!, February 8, 2004Reviewer: A reader from USAI can't get past the first couple chapters. The book is scattered, hard to read and basically unenjoyable. A complete waste of time and money. Plus the foundation of this pseudo-doctor's feeding regime is the Pottenger Cat Study. This is an antequated study from the 1930's that had no controls. Reading it, any nutritionist worth their salt would know the diet Pottenger fed lacked taurine which caused his problems. Why doesn't Dr. Yarnall? Now, we have that and much more in today's food. How else can generations of cats reproducing year after year and living long heathly lives on commercial diets. This book is just one big long scare tactic to sell her product.But, it has one pratical use. It's a great sleep aid."
5,Can't get enough...,"... of this toy! Our dogs prey drive goes wild when they see these balls come out. We have to monitor the use though. They each have to have their own ball and we have to take them away from the dogs before they collapse. They go really go crazy for them and would play 'soccer' for hours until they drop. The only down side is that our dogs can dig their teeth into the plastic around where the small opening is on one end. This creates gashes which we need to keep scraped down after play. Otherwise the dogs mouths, cheeks and lips become very sore and cut up as they roll the balls around the yard. (Keep in mind we have very strong dogs with high prey drive) When they have the gashes made, they can carry the ball around. Ours carry them proudly around the yard as if it is a trophy! If the balls were made of some sort of really hard rubber like a black type Kong or something it would be better, but then they would weigh too much. For the money - you just can't beat this toy!"
3,The Almost Indestructible Ball - it is - dog isn't,I purchased one of these for our Jack Russell which goes through volley and soccer balls like they were balloons. He loves to roll them using his nose but if able to trap the ball will find a seam and pop - no more ball.This ball is almost indestructible but in it's hardness it becomes scratched and gets burrs that cut and abrade his nose to the point of an open wound. And as Russell owners know that will not stop them.A great ball if you watch and keep the scratches and burrs smoothed down. I'm still looking for a ball that is a little less hard but tough enough to prevent a tooth from penetrating it. A basketball would be perfect but for the tiny gripper nodules which act as sandpaper as he rolls it around the yard.
1,Waste of money.,"Sorry. I wanted to give it a better review, but it really was a waste of money. It's a very hard ball. My 3 Siberian Huskies and my Lab mix will ''NOT'' play with ball. They have NO interest in it. It just sits in the yard. My dogs prefer the 8'' Teaser ball so I am here to order another 8'' Teaser ball."
5,"Yes, it's really indestructable.","Great ball for rough players. Really big! Best for large open spaces, as my pitbull pushes it around with her nose and rapidly picks up speed. Not so good in apartment.Will need to purchase smaller version for indoors."
2,For Horses NOT dogs,Don't make the mistake of thinking your dog could play with this. It's to large. Would be great if they made it smaller for dogs
2,Ok unless your dog is a chewer...,"We have a 70lb lab mix who is not only a chewer but is pretty smart and figured out within a few minutes to ""corner"" the ball and then he could chew the heck out of it. Yes it rolls but if your dog gets it into a corner he will get pieces off of it if he keeps at it. Not a good toy for an unsupervised dog and would recommend only with supervision."
5,The Best Ball,"My dog loves this ball. If you have a dog that pops every ball that comes in sight, or chews every toy he owns in a day, then this is the ball for you. It is a very hard plastic. I would compare the hard plastic to a bowling ball, but about as heavy as a basket ball. I still give it 5 stars because my pit mix plays with it all by himself and rolls it around like a soccer ball all over the yard. Don't kick it, lol... it hurts your foot. And don't throw it, cuz it would probably pop ur dog in the face. I got this ball almost a week ago, and there is only a couple scratches on it from my dog trying to pick it up with his mouth. Eventually he stopped trying to bite into it and started rolling it around like a true soccer player. It is the size of a soccer ball, by the way. I was also excited when I realized that the ball was blue instead of red. Hope this helps!"
5,our english bulldog LOVES this ball...,"Our dog, Tex, goes crazy now whenever i mention his Indestructible Ball [...] That's how much he loves it. There is no way any dog could ever rip this ball apart, even a pitbull. It is truly indestructible."
2,"Heavy, Slow Ball","I bought this for my 50 lb. Lab Puppy. The pup demolishes tennis balls, and all sorts of durable rubber chew toys so thought this ball would keep him entertained and yet be long-lasting. Well, it sure was a big ole plastic orange ball. It reminded me of a bowling ball.... actually pretty heavy and the slowest rolling ball I've ever seen. We rolled it on a hardwood floor and it was not very fun for the dog. It doesn't bounce, it's loud, it's slow... It just wasn't for us."
3,okay,"My dog loves to play with this ball, he even learned how to scoot it uphill with his nose! haha. I like how he cant pick it up... although I did see him manage to pick it up for a couple seconds once . the ball has so many scratches and sharp nicks on it now that it scrapes/cuts his nose from him scooting it, he also got two cuts on the inside of his paws from him pawing at it . but honestly he dosnt seem to mind . But that just means I have to limit his time playing with this ball to prevent his nose from getting cut. I havent read ALL the reviews but Im pretty surprised I havent read anyone else having this problem .bottom line, I cant really use this ball for that long before I see my dogs nose getting scraped from the friction, but like I said... he dosnt seem to mind at all he just loves to play with the ball too much ."
3,"Good, but not indestructible",My dog LOVED this toy. However there is a notch on one part of the ball that she found within the first 5 minutes allowing her to pick it up and eventually chew a very large hole into the ball. This ball would be perfect for my dog if not for that. It would be better if it were completely round with no indentions for them to grab onto.
5,Great for amusement and keeping busy,Love this ball. My labs can't bite it - too big so they roll it around and try to rip it apart but cannot. Keeps them very busy!
1,bowling ball?,I bought two for my 1 year old Old English Sheepdog. These are more like bowling balls than play balls for dogs. It's so hard and heavy he doesn't know what to do with it.
3,Best Ball,"Best Ball for durability but you HAVE TO watch your dog,put it away and out of reach when they are bleeding/and or done with it, AND file down the rough/sharp snags that WILL appear before you give it back to them. My dog has destroyed EVERY ball/toy we have given him but not this one. He gets a heck of a workout but I HAVE to take it away from him before he tears himself up too much or before his heart stops. I call it his ""crack ball"" L.O.L. But seriously.....heed my warnings...I ONLY gave it 3 stars because you have to watch your dog and maintain the ball."
3,sphere is probably okay - but was never delivered,"My first attempt to review this was banned - why? The note informing me that the review was banned said Amazon does not tolerate ""Obscene or abusive"" language. Possibly they objected to my use of the more common term for ""sphere"", so I'm trying to re-post, substituting ""sphere"" for the more common term for these toys. Thus the awkward Subject line here. The 10"" sphere itself is probably fine. These spheres are great toys for dogs, especially young ones, and they're a nice supplement to the tough rubber Kong toys. A smaller version which I ordered at the same time was delivered, and our dogs do like to push it around, but the 10"" version never arrived. It may be helpful to check that it's in stock before actually ordering."
2,Boring!,"I bought this ball for my active one and a half yr. old German Shepherd. He destroys every toy we give him, so I thought I would give this ball a try. After a couple of minutes of trying to pick it up, he lost interest in the ball and it has been in the same spot in the yard ever since. If your dog likes to chase toys that bounce, or grab toys and run with them,like my Harley does, I would not bother with this product. I was very dissappointed in this toy."
5,This is great!,This CD is amazing! It has songs for everyone. It goes from techno to R&B Ballads! NO music lover shoudl be without it! The lyrics are also amazing. The songs seem to come deep from the heart and that makes it easy for a person to connect with them.
3,love title song,"I bought this CD for the title song. its got a really good beat. I also enjoy track 4. However, the rest of the CD lacks interest. Track 3 is misleading in that it is nothing like any of the other songs."
3,Great Single,"I am not a fan of radio music...so its VERY RARE that I find something I do like. ""Gotta Get Thru This"" is one of them. With such a classic techno bass sample, put to such a a solid 80's like beat, you can't go wrong.I am still listening to the rest of the tracks as I write this, but I am in love with ""Gotta Get Thru This"". Maybe it has to do with me trying to get through a break up of my own. But this is one killer song, that must be blowin up on dance floors everywhere."
4,GOOD CD!!,I really think this CD is a success! It has really good music for a party! I really like 'I'm Gonna Get Through This'! It's so up beat and awesome!
2,"""This"" Fails To Live Up To Promising Single","Daniel Bedingfield's pulsating 'Gotta Get Thru This' remains one of the primo pop songs of 2002, but the accompanying album fails to deliver much beyond that track. The album opens with the appropriately-titled 'Blown It Again', but doesn't get the least bit decent to track three(the title cut). The two ensuing ballads, 'If You're Not The One' and the acoustic-framed 'He Don't Love You Like I Love You' are both first-rate tracks, but are only a sad indication of the potential that is squandered here. It would probably help slightly if Bedingfield were a better singer--he's far from bad, but not distinctive or original enough to lift the mediocre material much beyond just that. All in all, a disappointing effort all the way around."
3,Upcoming pop star,"I discovered Daniel thru a promo for a couple of afternoon soaps singing ""If Your Not the One"" the promo is actually more beautiful than than the version on the cd (used synthesizer during promo). Other songs that were also good were ""He Don't Love You Like I love You"", ""Honest Questions"", ""Without the Girl"", ""James Dean (I Wanna Know)"", ""Girlfriend"", and ""Gotta Get Thru This"" (acoustic version). The other songs are unremarkable. I believe he will improve as he seasons and with better quality lyrics. Would I buy this Cd again. Yes."
1,"I mean, bad","I didn't buy this CD, I downloaded it off the net. Let's just say I deleted the files about 30 seconds into them-they all sound exactly the same. You can tell someone did this by himself with a computer-this is so bad it's not even worth giving away free.""Gotta Get Thru This"", the lead single, makes me physically ill hearing it. How can THIS be popular in the US? What a shame. What a shame."
3,Good to Some Degree,"When I first heard ""Gotta Get Thru This"" on the radio, I was hooked immediately. After some extensive research, I finally found out that Daniel Bedingfield sang it. I bought this Cd yesterday. The acoustic version of ""Gotta Get Thru This"" is excellent as well as ""Inflate My Ego."" The rest of the songs remind me a little too much of Backstreet Boys/N'Sync. I bought this album expecting a good dance Cd, so was a little disappointed. I wouldn't recommend buying this if you expect the same thing I expected. However, if you don't mind the majority of the songs sounding ""pop"" then definitely buy this album."
5,Buy this CD!,"This is absolutely, no doubt the best CD of 2002. I think I listen to it at least twice a day, and I'm not tired of it yet. ""Gotta Get Thru This"" is a great song, but there's SO much more on the CD. You will NOT be disappointed!"
5,First CD in a long time I acutally bought,"Well I am sure you are all aware of the downloading of music. This CD is the first CD in a long time that I would/did actually pay good money for. Daniel Beddingfield is the first original artist I have heard in a very long time. I honestly enjoy every song on this album, (although some a little bit more than others). Daniel's music is great for those who have thoughts about that special person in their life or even just those like to have a bit of a different beat. There is one song number 7 I think, that reminds me of the US doublemint gum commercial, but other than that it's Brilliant. I must say that I listen to music all day and have never heard a male write words as deep and meaningful as his. The choice of lyrics and the melody to which those words are set is such a pleasure to hear. I would/have recommend this album to any and all who are lovers of new and original talent."
3,A few decent songs.,"I listened to this after I found the CD in my car. I think my wife bought it. I will have to rag on her for this one. I liked one song that I previously heard from the CD that was a radio hit. Admittedly, it is a sappy love song, but a good one. Most of the songs on this CD sound nothing like that. Gotta Get Thru This may be the best song on the CD. It is a fast dance number that Matches Bedingfield's voice nicely. Overall, I recommend you listen to the samples and decide for yourself. I think the CD besides the radio hits, lack emotion. It is usually the opposite. Bedingfield has tons of talent and maybe his next outing will be better."
2,Darren Hayes Wannabe,"Ok...I admit. this guy can sing. hes got a humongous range, and know how to work every corner of a song. The problem is, only a few of his songs are worth working. As a matter of fact, there are three. First and foremost, is the Beautiful range buster ""if youre not the one"" All I have to say about it is that if it doesnt give you a tingle in your spine, then you should check you pulse. The next is ""girlfriend."" the ingenius idea of using his voice for the string part is great, and its a nice summery song. the last is ""without the girl."" This song is a motown throwback, but in the best way. Other than these songs, he sounds like hes making Darren Hayes' ""Spin""'s Bastard stepchild. The other songs are harsh sounding, and just not up to the lofty standards of his three good ones."
5,Spark Forest,"Since radio lost its appeal for me a decade ago, I had no clue who Daniel Bedingfield is. The cover looked intriguing; and I am so glad I read the reviews here on Amazon! What a wonderful set. ""James Dean (I Wanna Know)"" is riding high as my own personal #1 song that makes me constantly hit repeat play. It's a driving rocker with a with Daniel's searing vocal and the great ""I wanna know"" background chorus. Another favorite is ""Friday"" with its driving beat, pop rock chorus and great lyric, ""My head is a hurricane; my mind is a touch insane."" ""Girlfriend"" is a pretty pop love song. Bedingfield's songwriting and production flourishes are consistently strong. What an amazingly strong set this is! If this set were a forest, Bedingfield sets it aflame because each song sparks. Enjoy!"
4,"Kind of an anachronism, but still good.","The Deathworld trilogy is three novels/novelettes in one. The storiesrevolve around a group of people who colonize a world that really doesn'twant them there. Everything that creeps, crawls or flies attacks thecolonists with tooth, claw and stinger. Even some plants get in on theact. An outsider is brought in who determines what the problem is, andgives them a temporary solution. The others stories are about the effortsof the colonists, who are all strong, rugged people, to find an alternatehome. The anachronism for me was the obvious twentieth century weaponstechnology in a future involving interstellar travel. But if you cansuspend your disbelief it's still a good read."
5,Deathworld Trilogy,Outstanding Sci-fi written by one of the masters of the genre. A must read for any sci-fi or Harry Harrison fan.
5,sounds country,Everything looks and plays great! I like the song my town it get's me in the heart every time. Scott K.
5,Dang... This is good,"This is quite possibly the best CD that Montgomery Gentry has made. It is one of the few CDs that I can listen to all the way through without skipping a song here and there. Among my favorites are ""My Town"" of course, ""Break My Heart Again"", ""Speed"", and ""Lie Before You Leave"". If you're just beginning to listen to Montgomery Gentry this would be my recommendation for a starting purchase. Montgomery Gentry is one of those country singers that borders along the lines of rock music as well as country. The content of their songs tend to be more upbeat and appealing to listeners who don't want to listen to the classical country music they often associate all country music to. I would also recommend their other CDs but I think you should start with this one to get a true taste of what most of their songs are about."
3,Disappointing,"I was really looking forward to Montgomery Gentry's third release. Tattoos & Scars was unbelievably good. Carrying On came across as a rushed, but competent disc; I wasn't a big fan at first, but I grew to appreciate it.Sadly, I have been unable to ""get"" this CD. Most of the songs are forgettable. ""My Town"" strikes me as watered down John Cougar Mellencamp, and it's close to the best song on the disc. ""Free Fall"" is the only cut that I would really listen to if I could choose. ""Speed"" has its moments, but the whole ""can you get me, zero to sixty"" hook is almost comedic.I really hope that Montgomery Gentry recovers from their success and gets back to the style they used on Tattoos & Scars. The hard edge is really just absent from this CD."
4,This is my town..... so give me some speed...Hell yeah!,"The words of Eddie Montgomery in the title track bring up images that seem to stay with the albums tracks of americana life from running away from a bad love in ""speed"", to getting down at the bar dive even though your life isn't what you expected in ""hell yeah"".This Cd also suffers a little from the slump (as described by the amazon reviewer as the ""bar band"" feel) MG has toward the end of their cd's usually, but was a well thought out cd compared to ""carrying on""..But still slumps away from being a totally good albumn because of it.The remake of the Allman Brothers ""good Clean Fun"" off their 1990 album ""seven turns"" is a notable remake of the song but doesn't have the griityness of the original as done by Gregg Allman and co and so is more of a notable tribute to them than a owning of it.So that's why I give it 4 stars, great albumn but still not a cd full of material to write home about."
2,Does what it needs to do.,"The barrel on this is a bit longer that the other brand I usually use. I bought the barrel and the bags separately. Hoping the refills could be used for both. But alas, they only fit this one. It works, it holds poop, you keep your hand clean, you keep your neighbors happy, the price is right!"
4,Amazon Doggie Bags that 'work',"We've used various doggie bags over the last few years and a short time ago came across the Rasco Bottom Fed bags with dispenser. We like them best because they are economical, handy to pack, and quite easy to use. Since we've had a diffulcult time finding a local supplier, we found them on Amazon and have been a steady customer since. We're very pleased with the total results of our purchases."
5,Why does the seller not list the dimensions of this product?,"The dimensions of each flattened bag are about 8.5 inches wide by 13.5 inches long, more than wide enough."
1,DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM,"This ""tribute"" is a disgrace to the very talented Martina McBride. I don't know who the ""various artists"" are, but they sound like untalented karaoke bar singers. Save your money and buy Martina's ""Greatest Hits"" album so you can hear how the songs SHOULD be sung."
2,Ranma almost ended,"Okay, I won't bother to review the second episode, but I personally don't care for this volume because of the first episode. One, if you're a Shampoo fan, you'll probably find the end of this episode depressing. Two, although the humorous parts were pretty funny(especially the part where Genma and Soun beat up Ranma, and then when they replay his insults to Akane), I was really distracted from them because Akane kept acting like a real b*#%# in this! I mean, she hits Ranma at least twice as much as she does in the original story, if not more! And I won't forgive her for hitting him at the end of the episode. I mean, couldn't that oblivious %^@&$#^@@^ see that Ranma was upset at himself because he made Shampoo cry!? Of course, when she just keeps provoking him and he gets angry at her, she of course, pounds him. If you like Akane, watch out for this volume, because it could ruin how you see her."
1,amateur production,"Don't waste your time or money on this tape. This production is something you might see in a college level TV class. It is disjointed, confused, with amateur production values. Now that all aside, I still would of found it tolerable, if it wasnt for the fact the narrator has the most annoying and irrritable tone of voice, I have ever heard! I can't remember one person to person, interview on board. and the tape doesnt know if it's main subject is the QM2, or the cheesy 70's like footage of RIO. Do not purchase this, there are other tapes available on each subject matter, with much higher production quality!"
5,"Wow, this ball is awesome!","I have two Rhodesian Ridgebacks and they play hard! This ball has held up for almost a year, and the dogs have yet to ruin it."
5,Awesome!,"Being Asian, it's uber essential for my kids to learn how to use chopsticks. These are perfect! I actually removed the orange attachment, it just got in the way. My daughter started using this around 2 and though she can now manage regular chopsticks, she still prefers the trainers. My 20 month old is starting to use them too. They fight over the 1 pair we have so I'm buying more!"
5,Encouragement,"Praise The Lord! Dear Pastor Locke, It is truly an honor and privilege to share what the Lord has done in my life by listening to your message. It's a constant reminder to let me know I am somebody, it reveals to me that I must be different to make it into the kingdom. It also touches my heart to know God can use a woman of a sincere heart in a great way. Thank you for allowing our Father to use you mightly in him you. The Lord shared with me in the beginning of Sept that you are the NOW QUEEN ESTHER for this time. You've deeply inspired my heart and I really admire you. Often times we the fans desire to meet you and just would like to stand in your presence because we know that being in the true presences we are also standing in the presence of God. Stay encouraged and Be blessed!"
3,love this show,"wish they had more season. good dvds, only prob is that they still skipped even though they were brand new. not sure if it was the dvds or my playstation."
2,"Aimed High, Shot Low","I know what Carnivale tried to be, trouble is, it failed to achieve what it set out to accomplish. Maybe had it been allowed to run its entire planned six-season arc it might've matured into a truly great series, but as it was, I found myself let down as time and time again what I long predicted beforehand came to pass on the screen. Where were the plot twists, where was the epic scale, where were the memorable moments? I probably expected too much because I'd heard so much praise about it (yes, Rob, once again I mean you) but rather than experiencing a shiver-inducing work of darkness, I found instead a mildly disturbing Depression-era Gothic that was more about mundane grossouts than genuine supernatural eeriness. I can forgive almost anything in a show except the very thing Carnivale was most guilty of: being boring."
2,unsatisfied,"Some of the discs in do not play at all in any player I insert them into. I believe it is a problem with thae actual disc itself. It will not even play on my computer, laptop, or portable devices. I am too upset."
5,One of THEE best HBO Series!!!!!!,"Why HBO didn't renew this series, I'll never know. It's based back in the ""dust bowl"" era of America with a boy in a traveling circus and a preacher gone evil. It deals with the power to heal, good vs evil, and more. Carnivable was based in a time of nobility. However man created wonder for reason. And the show takes you back to that time of wonder and after each episode you think back to that time of nobility.A very well made series! But why didn't HBO keep going with it????"
5,"two season DVD of the HBO series ""Carnival""","This series is incredible of the 1930's survival, one way of life. Totaly odd and facanating. I ordered the two season set, and it's one of those series you can watch over and over again, you always catch something different. I loved it."
4,"Moving story, in the vein of Angela's Ashes","Sommer tells a very moving and realistic story about his experiences as a Jewish child and young man during the era of Hitler. His descriptions of the people he met along the way come alive as he tells the story, and the events leap off the page. His perspective is different from others I've read in that he comes from Hungary and most of his trials are outside of the camps, so the action and setting changes constantly. Like Frank McCourt in Angela's Ashes, he tends to paint himself the hero or the pitiable one in the story, and that loses him a star. Definitely worth the read."
1,An unfair review,"The other reviewers essentially all stated: ""if you liked the author's previous book, then you'll love this one."" I thought the first books was one of the worst books I had ever read, so this one is most likely just as dull and lacking in historical understanding as the first one.Of course I have not read this one - and never will - so I am entirely judging a book by its author."
4,GOOD SHOW,"This one is your best bet. Vol 1 is minus Zoot and Brookmeyer. Indeed there are some short quartet tracks here too (with John Eardley on trumpet) but Vol 1 is all Quartet. Eardley is in the larger group too. The Red Door and Polka Dots and Moonbeams both with Brookmeyer on piano are classics. Gerry is the only horn soloist on Polka Dots. Zoot plays the opening chorus of I Know Don't Know How superbly. Gerry later recorded it with the Concert Jazz Band. The sound quality is above average for 50's even 60's live recordings. Gerry is very full toned throughout and I've come to realize that any time he wasn't deep toned through out his career, it was deliberately lightened. - 70min. of music."
5,NOT FICTION!,"Anyone who has ever seen ""Tootsie"" or several episodes of ""M.A.S.H."" or the Broadway musical comedy ""A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Forum"" (one of the very few musicals that is actually also a COMEDY!) knows how very funny Gelbart is.With this volume of articles, memories, and even bits of scripts, Gelbart helps us understand why he has won awards in every medium he's written for, why he is so respected and, obviously, loved by people who work with him. This is a delightful, much-too-brief book, worthwhile if only for its appreciation of performers from Jack Benny to Whoopie Goldberg.One of the other on-line reviewers has called this book the ""worst kind of popular pulp fiction trash."" And it very well might be, were it not for the fact that it is TRUTH, NOT FICTION."
2,a gloss-over of the career of a brilliant comedy writer,"In this quick-read, Larry Gelbart, the man who not only wrote most of TV's MASH, but also penned the funniest Broadway Musical of all time, can't seem to settle on a topic long enough to analyze it. Because of this, even the aforementioned ""Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,"" gets a quick, glossed-over treatment - then it's on to the next topic. Gelbart is usually an adept comedy writer, but much of this book comes off cute and superficial. Not recommended."
1,"What, did Gelbart need a new Mercedes?","It's as though Larry Gelbart told his editor to rummage around for some material, no matter how old and outdated, and slap together a book. What a shame. Gelbart has the credentials to deliver an insightful look at American comedy and yet he gave us an aimless, rambling, long-winded series of pages that seemed to end when the page count got high enough. If you must read this, prepare to skip half.In the half you don't skip, you will find certain nuggets of insight in this book. In most cases, though, you will learn more by reading between the lines. Without intending to, Gelbart has given us a snapshot of a once-funny comedic mind who is reduced to repackaging once-funny material. It's an approach that doesn't work in standup, and it doesn't work here."
2,Disappointing,I was really disappointed in this book. He barely touches on all the projects he's worked on--there's not nearly enough written about ANY of the projects. Instead the book is mostly padding--padding of his random thoughts and philosphies instead of going into any depth about his famous works.
2,Disappointing and horridly edited,"I picked up this book looking for something very different from what I wound up with. The editor seems to have padded out a lot of miscellaneous articles by Gelbart with jottings of his own, pages of lavish praise of Gelbart that you would think would embarrass Gelbart to be published in a book under his own name. Has he no shame? Enough already with these selections from old TV Guides! What a waste of a great talent!"
5,Alec Baldwin - ooh la la,"The film is very much like actor, Alec Baldwin - sexy, charming, very funny and very well put together...Favorite part was when the adults got stoned at the party and watching Adam (Steve Martin) trying to stifle his sh*teating buzz grin in the presence of the ex-husband (Jake - Alec B.) who is having an affair with his love interest (Jane - Meryl S.). It's complicated. It's hilarious. It's well worth a view. Check it out...without reservation, five stars."
1,Not Complicated At All,"Predictable stuff about exes ""seeing if anything is still there."" The remarried ex-husband feels certain they have grown beyond all the old stresses of careers & family. The ex-wife just wants to make sure she got ""right of last refusal."" Add a bunch of anorexic weepy college kids and a desperate ""nice guy"" suitor waiting on the side. Why is Hollywood working so hard to make the audience feel good about a woman breaking up a long term-marriage and stringing two men along who are quite positive they want to be with her in the whirlwind of ""finding herself""?"
4,One of my new favorites,I have watched this at least five times and intend to watch it at least five more times. It has made me laugh so hard that I have cried. My favorite scenes are with Meryl Streep and Steve Martin - their comedic chemistry is unexpected and crazy funny.
5,2 thumbs up,"this is a great movie.... romance and comedy with a good plotwould also recommend, ""somethings gotta give"" with Jack Nicholson, Diane Keaton, Keanu Reeves ANOTHER GREAT ONE"
5,It's Complicated,loved the movie and it arrived in very quickly in good shape would use seller again.
3,Watched,I watched the movie and it had some laughs. I wouldn't want to own it. Watching it once was enough.
3,Not So Complicated,"This is a sometimes funny movie wherein a divorced couple Streep and Baldwin have an affair. That part isn't complicated. It's intended to be a comedy and there are spots were it is. but there were other spots that left me feeling embarrassed for Streep. That feeling didn't include Baldwin. He came across as a self-centered cheater since he had remarried. Steve Martin whom Streep becomes interested in as her senses return following the hanky-panky with Baldwin is adequate as a caring suitor; however, his role is actually minor and without any comedy.Overall I was mildly disappointed with the movie."
5,this is a keeper,although the first copy of the movie did not work. it would not load. the replacement arrived shortly and was fine. this movie is hilarious. good comedy and i think anyone in a relationship can relate to the humor. i will enjoy this many times.
2,"It's Complicated, isn't. It's Predictable.",A disappointing performance by both Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin. I get a sense that the director and writers didn't do their jobs very well either. Everyone I know that watched it also found that it dragged and was generally not entertaining.
3,It's Not That Complicated,"A talented cast to be certain, but the story comes up rather short, leaving the viewer disappointed.This type of film ( romantic comedy with a dash of drama ) has been done before and better by other directors and writers."
4,Enjoyable & Funny,"I really enjoyed the movie. Very comedic in parts, touching and remove in others. Ended well, but an expected ending (reason for 4 stars). But not sure what else to expect. Good, will watch again."
5,Great funny movie,"Very funny, love Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin, so true to life, would love to watch again.Thanks very much"
5,its complicated,"One of my go to movies. very funny and well scripted, funny story. just a light comedy that is fun to watch. anything meryl strepp is in is almost always worth watching."
1,IDIOTIC,"This was one of the stupidest movies I've seen in a long time. Glad I didn't buy it, but got it from the library. Meryl Streep is too good an actress to have participated in such nonsense. The ONLY good thing about it was that it was about a couple in their 50's. Most movies are about these 20-something twits, like no one over the age of 25 could possibly fall in love. Alec Baldwin is totally disgusting."
1,Warning: Rental DVD doesn't have bonus features,"I'm posting a review here for those few who may be looking to rent, but not buy the DVD of It's Complicated. I loved the film in the theater and wanted to listen to the director's commentary, which according to Amazon and other DVD review sites this DVD has. Rented the DVD today and there are no bonus features on it. This is the first time I've had a rental DVD that is specially marked ""Rental"" and lacks the usual features. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT and shame on whoever at Universal came up with this idea and it certainly won't get me to buy the DVD now."
2,NOT FUNNY!!,"In trying to be fair, perhaps it's because of the types of roles the main characters usually play, but I found nothing funny in this movie. Actually I wasleery about buying this because I had never heard of it, and if it was any good I'm sure it would have been publized due to the lead actors. The premise ofa self centered philander trying to worm his way back into his original family when they have already gone on with their lives, and when, if he is successful in his project, will ruin everyone's life, is not funny when played by these people. Put Chevy Chase as the man and perhaps Goldie as the woman and maybeit works."
2,It was complicated,"I thought the movie ""It's Complicated"" was a so-so movie. Alec Baldwin was funny and a bit of a cad, however, the marvelous actress Meryl Streep was a bit overwrought in her part and a somewhat of a disappointment. I wonder if she was just following direction, if so her talents were wasted in this farce. I expected much more from two of my favorite actors. I didn't honestly buy the story either"
4,as expected,"downloaded a movie - it came down quickly and played fine. No stuttering, no gaps, no problem. (Movie is a bit weak however.)"
3,Absurdly silly,"A small film, all in all, but even good actors and actresses have to buy bread every day. It is well acted but it is insignificant.A divorced woman and her ex-husband who asked for the divorce to marry a younger one and have a child with her are confronted one day with the dissatisfaction of the ex-husband who is being marched around by his new wife. This ex-husband tries to get back on solid earth and ground by having an affair with his ex-wife.She accepts out of vanity at the same time as she starts an affair with her architect. That builds a silly story, but life is silly.Add to that three children on the ex-married couple's side and one on the side of the new wife married to the ex-husband and you have it all in a nutshell. In other words it is nuts.Enjoy cracking those nuts.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"
4,Old love vs. New love.,"It's Complicated is a cute romantic comedy even though it's about 30 minutes too long. Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin have sizzling chemistry together, who ever would've guessed??? Streep's chemistry with Steve Martin is not that electric or convincing. I love Martin but he seems so bored and his character follows Meryl around like a lovesick little puppy, Martin is good actor but I just didn't care for him in this film. I'm usually not a fan of Baldwin but I really thought he was hilarious and so adorable as Meryl's ex-husband. I liked this film but I don't love it, but it's a lot better than some other chick-flicks I've seen lately."
3,Its BORING,"Meryle Streep,Alec Baldwin,and Steve Martin are fantastic together,but the kids bring no life to this film,and Meryl's girlfriends,Rita,Mary Kay Place,and alot of great leading ladies I've seen over the years have no lines,they just sit there while listening to Meryl complain about her life.This same movie with Bette Midler was alot funnier,I think it was called ""That old feeling.""I can't believe ""It's Complicated"" was such a huge hit.Its boring."
4,Not that complicated to follow.,"Meryl Steep is such a remarkable actress and seems to just get better with age. After watching her play Julia Child, I couldn't believe how natural she seemed in Its Complicated. I couldn't believe it was the same actress. Is there anything she can't play? It is your typical chick flick and has all of the same predictable elements; however, she and Steve Martin make the film worth watching."
4,No music by the Association?,"Everyone's good in this movie and it has a few laughs including a big one with a laptop computer. It looks like a Ralph Lauren commercial expanded to to 90 minutes which is a little distracting, though."
5,Real life,This was a very cute realistic and funny movie. There are a lot of laughs. A lot of situations that happen in a divorced persons life that makes this so relatable. This movie is just a light hearted relatable movie.
4,cute,"Watched it on a flight to New York City, kept me entertained. Sweet movie and I love anything with Meryl...."
2,Designer problems for designer lifestyles,"Meryl Streep acting her age - wonderful. Alec Baldwin playing himself - wonderful.Otherwise, it's hard to believe or feel sorry for people in the world portrayed. Designer houses. Designer clothes. Designer children. Meyers has a certain amount of nerve, asking us to sympathize with a woman's empty nest syndrome when her nest is a multi-million-dollar estate in Santa Barbara. Which is still too small for a single senior citizen, apparently, so she hires an oddly orange Steve Martin to build an extension which will be costlier and larger itself than many people's homes.Between all the perfect teeth, perfect food, perfect weather, perfect hotel suites and perfect background songs, this felt like Sex and the City III. There's even the gang of three caucasian friends hooting and cackling about sex. I came away wondering ""How complicated is it, really?"""
3,"""You've Feng Shuied Your Whole Life""","I may be 59 years old but I'm still not quite old enough to find a romance between Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin as an exciting prospect for an evening of engrossing cinematic entertainment. No offense, I like both of them so that's not it. Closer to the truth would be that 'It's Complicated' falls smack dab in the middle of the infamous ""chick flick"" genre, not my favorite category to say the least. My wife and daughter both wanted to watch it and being the kind of guy I am I joined them in the viewing experience.I found it to be cute and witty, though perdictable. They're both talented thespians. I thought Steve Martin's performance as the timid and sensitive ""other man"" and rival was a nice counterpoint to the aggressive narcisstic Baldwin. Needless to say I survived the evening without a scratch."
5,GREAT movie!,"If you like Alec Baldwin, this is for you! What a great story....and very entertaining indeed! VERY funny and also sad in the right moments too. Watch this movie."
3,An Affair to Remember . . .,"Nice little story about a divorced couple (Merrill Streep and Alec Baldwin) who find they still have special feelings for each other. Since Alec is now remarried, but in a relationship that is not what he had expected, Merrill begins to ask herself if this is right or wrong and where do we go from here. Steve Martin's role is that of an architect, and not the normal comedic role we would expect for him.Again, it's cute and the acting is good. It handles an awkward and complicated situation and expresses special feelings as well as humorous moments."
3,"good performances, chemistry strained a bit","I was ready to be amused and entertained as we love Alex Baldwin, Meryl Streep, and Steve Martin. The ensemble doesn't quite work and the sparks are few. light weight and only somewhat enjoyable. Meryl is appealing on all fronts and does not appear to have had face surgery which makes her more appealing for her comfort with herself."
2,No Substance,"If you liked the movie Valentine's Day you'll probably disagree with my review. However if you thought Valentine's Day was another empty movie full of big name actors, then you may agree with me.I couldn't even bare to watch this movie through. I watched the first forty minutes and gave up. There just wasn't enough going on to keep my attention. It was very empty and the chemistry between the actors was just not there."
3,It's complicated,Unfortunately I never saw it ~ paid for it ~ system went down ~ never saw the movie and do not think I should pay for it either.I just was not able to connect to see the movie ~ just kept receiving notes on What I needed to view the movie ~ got disgusted ~ quit ~ Same with Nexflex ~ doesn't seem to agree with me ~ signed up ~ received no movies just always notes on what I need to view the movies ~ got disgusted ~ quit ~fatcatlgb@aol.com
4,Fun and Funny,"My wife and I really enjoyed watching this movie together - very entertaining. It has fun, quirky characters and the acting by Streep and Baldwin is very good."
2,Disappointed,"After all the hype, I was looking forward to seeing it. I think the scenes with the girl friends started the story in one direction, and then someone dropped the ball. The story changed, and didn't make any sense. Save your money on this one."
4,It's Complicated,A very funny film. Uplifting and side splitting. The cast was perfect. Meryl Streep always gives a great performance in what ever she does.
5,Great Movie,I think this is a great movie. I love anything with Meryl Streep in it and would definately recommend this movie.
1,I couldn't watch this DVD in Holland,"This dvd contained a regional number, not compatible with my dutch dvd-player. I think Amazon should warn it's customers from abroad. this turned out to be a waste of money, including high costs of transportation. A disappointment!"
4,Good movie,"So my husband & I were a bit skeptical about seeing this movie, we debated for the longest time if we even wanted to rent it (""old"" people having sex was just ew to us). So glad we finally broke down & rented it! Hilarious. We ended up buying it because it was that good :)"
2,Meryl how could you?,"I have been a fan of Meryl Streep for her entire career. This production is so not up to her usual standards ... and it's a movie that has been made to target my demographic. All I can say is, Meryl, how COULD you?"
2,Two hours wasted,Most romantic comedies run about 90 minutes but this one dragged on for nearly two hours. Steve Martin wasn't needed in this one. Comedy? What comedy!? I will admit Alec Baldwin made watching the movie a little less boring. I could go on but this movie has already wasted two hours of my life. Save your time and money.
1,The WORST purchase EVER!!!,"I am appalled at the LACK of quality this store has! When I opened my package I noticed the DVD container was cracked. Strike 1. Then when I tried to watch this movie it jumped around, it froze, it has wavy lines going through it and 20 minutes into the movie the DVD simply stopped working! I contacted the seller a week ago and have not heard a peep out of them yet! My advice: DON'T EVER BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER!!!!!!!!"
1,Don't let the famous names fool you into thinking this is going to be a good film.,"The story line was very weak. Meryl Streep, I feel, is is a much better dramatic actress. She over acted throughout the whole movie. Aside from the children, who had minor roles, Steve Martin was the most natural actor in the group! I would never recommend it."
5,Funny funny movie.,Something to keep in a CD movie library. Alec Baldwin at his best ! Steve Martin and Meryl Streep gave great performances also !
5,Best movie ever!!!,Best movie ever!!!! We have watched it multiple times and enjoy it each time. Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin were amazing.
2,"Product placement is a bit of car crash, otherwise liked it.","Liked this movie, classic Meryl supported by a good cast. The' will-she, won;t she?' plot kept a bit of suspense going throughout.However the thing I most remember afterwards , is the product placement. Wow! This will date the movie I think. I counted ads for a chain of bathroom stores, a cosmetic brand, a water brand and a type of car. The car was quite amusing actually, as part of the plot involves various family members driving out of Meryl;s home, potentially leaving her alone and lonely. However plot device was ruined for me, as when we saw the car moving towards the exit, I kept thinking `I hope the accelerator doesn't jam'."
4,Hilarious!,"This movie was hysterical. I laughed out loud throughout. Meryl Streep is excellent as always, and Alec Baldwin made the film with his over the top performance. I was a little leery of the choice of Steve Martin, but he was great too. A very understated likable character. I recommend this movie to everyone I know--it was fantastic."
5,A departure from the average Romance Comedy. Very entertaining and funny!,"I like the average romance comedy, they are usually so predictable and cliche, all that happens is they fall in love. but in this movie it is far more exciting and the thing I LOVE about this movie is the cast The Fab Four as I call them (Meryl Streep who is so funny, Alec Baldwin who is wonderful as always and I'm a fan of his from 30Rock, Steve Martin, and John Krasinski from the office) bring in more humor to this delightful comedy. The story is written so well and kept me laughing so much and it really is very entertaining I could not stop watching it. If you like comedy then this is for you."
5,Don't take what you have for granted!,"It's a movie about a couple, who have fallen back in love after 10 years of divorce. It's complicated because the guy is married, the women is attracted to her architect, and their children seem happier with them being divorced.The story is interesting and original.The movie has lots of romantic and funny scenes too.It tells you that even though you might think you will be happier after separating from your spouse, you might regret it later on because you will truly see his or her value then and wish you never took that decision.Very good movie for couples to watch."
3,Disappointed,"I was looking forward to this movie and found it disappointing. The characters didn't ""click"", some of the comic scenes just seemed wooden or forced. There were a few very funny scenes with Steve Martin and Meryl Streep but they were the exception, not the rule."
4,Really funny movie to me.,"I thought this movie was really great. It appealed to me a 40 something mom/wife. I think they could have done more with Steve Martin's character, but he wasn't the star of this movie anyway. Alec Baldwin did a great job with his character, as if it was written for him and I have always loved Meryl Streep. If you just want a movie to watch and have a good time doing so, watch this movie."
3,"Overaged giggles, not really a great comedy","Watched this movie and at the end of it I prayed that I didn't giggle like an overly eager teenager. These actors are better than this. Streep giggled throughout the movie like a teenager, Baldwin left much to be desired as an overly assertive ex who wanted to have an affair and Martin sort of just looped in there to give it some type of story line. Can't say I cared for it at all."
4,"DVD excellent, cover not so much.","The DVD itself is flawless. No scratches, skips, etc. But the cover is a photocopy, not the original--kind of tacky. And the plastic case was bent a bit in the middle."
3,Movie good; video so-so.,"The video was fun and entertaining. However, the film was ""goofy"" - in one place the pixels were all screwed up, and in another it froze. Too bad. Still, the movie had a good ""girlie"" plot, especially for anyone over 50 who has been divorced, but still likes their ""X""!"
3,very good,"I was surprised how good this movie is.... Martin holds his own with this all-star cast. Streep, is per the norm, phenomenal.And I thought the script was quite good. Director's commentary is worth the time."
5,Outstanding Movie,"This movie was hysterical! Normally NOT a fan of Meryl Streep or Alec Baldwin (but a huge fan of Steve Martin), we still thoroughly enjoyed this movie."
5,"funny, funny, funny",I laughed out loud 50 times at this flick. Alex Baldwin and Merryl Streep are the best. Enjoy!!!!!!!!!!
5,FUNNY AS HECK! I LOVE THIS MOVIE!,This movie is extremely funny! I love it! Meryl Streep is once again at her best... and Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin are no light weights! You will laugh your azz off!!
5,I just love it.,"This is truly my favorite movie of the moment; I can't get enough of these characters, especially Meryl Streep's ""Jane"" and Steve Martin's ""Adam"". I watch it anytime it airs on one of my premium channels and I had to have my personal copy for those times it is not on :-). I'd intended to view it in the theatre, but I was traveling as a financial contractor the year it was released and had little time for anything other than scheduling plane/hotel reservations and making sure I received payment for my work; I'm making up for lost time (LOL)!It's great to see people having fun in the prime of their lives; I pray that I will live life as fully and enthusiastically as these characters seem to. Nancy Myers is a genius (I also loved ""The Holiday""); you can see the hard work and extreme detail she puts in her movies. It is certainly appreciated by me. I hope we will continue to see more great films from her."
3,Alec Baldwin,"well this movie sort of grows on you. I feel bad for her, then I feel bad for him, then I don't like him and I like the boyfriend, then I feel bad for the boyfriend. So it's title ""It's Complicated"" really is well.. complicated. Enjoy it for fun but don't take it too seriously.When I first watched this I saw it with my 19 year old nephew. While I was feeling sorry for ""him"", my nephew was angry at him for the way he was treating his ex-wife and his kids. The next time I watched it, I too was angry with ""him."" Hmmm... Viewing it from a different age (era) may add an additional complicated twist."
5,Great Movie,This was a very funny movie and it had a very good story to it. I would recommend this movie to anyone even if they don't like romantic comedy. The actors and actresses were great. Love this movie.
1,Awful!,"I saw this at the movie theater and did not like it! There were a few laughs, but Meryl Streep's character was smarmy and condescending and awful. The sessions with her friends almost made me hate women; they were so insipid. Alec Baldwin, whom I love on 30 Rock, and Steve Martin, usually hilarious or at least entertaining, underplayed too much until he was playing his character stoned, and that was a pretty cliche setup. Also these actors, usually good-looking, appeared so unattractive. What happened? Alec's character was probably supposed to show some wear, but the angles from which he was filmed did not favor him at all. No one could have been more pampered or more ""perfect"" than Meryl's character; she didn't even have to let her croissants rise. Only good thing about the movie was the guy who plays Jim on The Office, but it seemed like he was in the wrong movie. Only other good thing was I saw it with a friend."
5,Funny!!! and Warm...and Funny!!!,"Meryl Streep and Alex Baldwin flawlessly embody single Jane and married Jake, the divorced Adlers, who after 10 years surprise themselves when they ""fall"" into an affair with each other. Laughs ensue when they show the real humanity of their characters and the issues that we all face--family, friends, business, maturity, growth and love. I've seen this movie more times than I'd like to admit because it's truly a fun, romantic comedy that effortlessly and honestly portrays life in the funniest, most life-affirming way."
2,5 STars for the kitchen!,"This film was truly moronic. The only thing that kept me going was views of the house and the new kitchen. Nice, but not worth the price of admission. Alec Baldwin was a big fat slob. Why would anyone want him? He's in the entertainment business, for heaven's sake. Doesn't he understand that physical attractiveness is part of the deal?"
3,Why did i watch this?,"I guess i watched this so that you don't have to. It's basically just a bunch of over the hill actors running around trying to relive there glory days. This is not a bad movie. It's the type of movie that your parents would probably love. Anyone under the age of 40 should probably not waist there time. There are much better romantic comedies with younger people. Does anyone really want to picture Meryl Streep sleeping with anyone? I sure don't. I give this movie 1 SHAKY THUMBS UP because it definately was not boring. However, It's not worth buying on dvd unless you're in your 60's. Then you can probably relate to this. I thought it was somewhat a waste of my time. HOLLA."
2,didn't like it,"I didn't like the movie. The playing is good, but the message is bad - ""don't think about anything, have fun, sleep with a married guy, and later you can think about the consequences and easily leave him"". This movie made me feel sad and bitter."
3,"""It's Complicated"" has funny moments but overall falls into a sappy predictable mess","Length:: 6:01 MinsGina from Haunted Flower reviews the movie ""It's Complicated"" directed by Nancy Meyers (who directed ""Something's Gotta Give"" and ""The Holiday"") and starring Meryl Streep, Alec Baldwin, and Steve Martin. A divorcee becomes the other woman with her ex-husband.[...]"
5,Hysterical!,"Meryl Streep has a versatility in acting and her knack for situation comedy is spot on with costars Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin. The story is very touching at times, but be prepared to howl with laughter during key moments of this film. This is a great movie and very entertaining with its ties to reality. Nicely done!"
4,Funny,Some very funny moments. The acting was wonderful. Meryl Streep adds a believable quality to her characters and she doesn't dissapoint in this movie.
3,Very entertaining,Always enjoy Meryl Streep in everything she does. She did an excellent job in a comedy rather than serious drama. Very entertaining.
4,"Sweet, if a little pat","A sweet film about love and romance in middle-age. A trifle sit-comish in its depiction of the mother/child relationships and neatly wrapped ending, but still a lot of fun. Genuinely touching."
4,No other movie like it!,"If you loved Welcome Back Kotter, you'll love this! Gabe Kaplan and his friends are on a quest to get reimbursed for damage to his car from a pothole. Each with a mental illness (none of which is portrayed distastefully), they come up with a brilliantly far-fetched plan to get what they want. This is a really good movie!"
5,Subtle but effective,"I have been using this DVD for over a year now and haven't tired of it. The moves are challenging enough to get a good sweat and stretch at the same time. While I'm not that limber, I am able to go at my own pace and position. I keep thinking that some day I will be able to do the advanced positions, but I'm not discouraged as I do see and feel results.I have used 4 other DVD's in the past, but this is my favorite. I always look forward to the final corpse and usually fall asleep -- it is that relaxing!"
5,Excellent yoga workout!,"I love yoga. After some brief introductions to yoga I immediately fell in love with it. This video is great for all levels, there are options to modify poses which may be too difficult for beginners as well as tips on ways to make simple poses more challenging. I like the voice over, her calm fluid voice fits well with the mood of the video. I feel more strength and flexibility after doing this video as well as a greater sense of self and worth. I enjoy the conversational parts of the video, they are very encouraging. I have recommended this video to anyone interested in yoga or losing weight. I love it!"
5,Great video!,"I went on a retreat with Ashley a few months ago, and was excited to hear that I could order the DVD for my home practice. She's a fantastic instructor and more importantly a Life Coach! You get so much more than a tight tush with this one!"
3,Just ok,"This dvd is not the greatest. I liked the fact that it had some challenging poses, but other than that it was very annoying. In certain poses where you need to be very still and fix your gaze at something that is not moving the instructor was talking a lot in the midst of that and I was losing focus by looking at the screen and I would fall from the pose. it was becoming very irritating to me. I was very very excited to try it but unfortunately I didn't like it very much."
5,Happy Yogini,"Wasn't sure what to expect from this DVD. I am a beginner Yoga practitioner, having had a class with an outstanding instructor, who is leaving on another adventure. This DVD takes a holistic approach towards yoga and health and well being, talking you thru the asanas (poses) while demonstrating them, and also ensuring you are mindful of your weight loss goals. Its not too hard for beginners, yet structured to flow for those who are advanced with additional, more difficult asanas. I find the DVD to be inspirational, even when I dont want to practice, and the time (about an hour incl. the meditation at the end) goes quickly and starts my day off well. I can't say whether it will make me lose weight but I do work up a sweat and I'm sure it will tone my body and enhance my well being overall. I recommend this yoga DVD for everyone."
2,Not very relaxing,This DVD is not relaxing at all in the sense that you expect yoga to be. The instructions and poses are rushed. You're so busy trying to keep up with what she is saying you're MORE stressed by the end of the video.
2,Not for begginers !,"This video is excellent IF you are already familiar with ADVANCED POWER yoga. I bought this at Walmart to help me on my weightloss program...my back has been out for days, this tape really injured me. I know it was my fault for not stopping when I realise it was too advanced for me. NOT FOR PEOPLE WITH WEAK BACKS ! Also the instructors strained ""Smile"" throughout the workout was just silly."
2,"Nonexistent cues, bad quality","I guess I'm in the minority here but I couldn't stand this video. The instructor is annoying and seems unable to cue the flow. I practice at an intermediate level and I was constantly stopping to see where she was going.For beginners, she should give common modifications during the flow.The sound quality was also quite poor - going in and out throughout."
3,decent,"Not the type of yoga I was looking for, it's very slow paced and focused on meditation, but it was still a good yoga video. However, the instructor had a very distracting... let's call it a ""wardrobe malfunction"". I had to give the video to someone else because I was unable to focus with this video on."
3,GOOD WORK OUT..BREATH HARD,I thought Yoga would be alot of breathing and bending little did I know.It was hard work. I now have a new admiration for those that do yoga.I am working on it. She is good. If she would just not talk about herselfit would be perfect.
5,A great yoga workout.,"I've been practicing yoga off and on for over ten years and this is a very solid workout. The moves are to a level where anyone can do them or modify them if they find a move too difficult. Don't get me wrong, this is a challenging workout, but with time you will be amazed at your progress.I've found that the new style of yoga dvd's have a jerky, rapid movement style that I find dangerous (certainly for people new to yoga), but this DVD used fluid movements.I have been doing this DVD for about a month and my body has toned up a lot, and I have been working out 5 days a week for over 10 months, so someone who hasn't worked out at all will really feel more toned. I am amazed at what this one DVD has done for my body."
5,"A gentle, wonderful, and easy-to-use resource","Hosted by expert yoga instructor Ashley Turner (who also holds a Master's in Counseling Psychology), Yoga for Weight Loss is a beautiful instructional DVD that walks the viewer through vinyasa flow yoga sequences and strengthening poses ideal for toning and improving one's muscles. The vinyasa flows cause one's heart rate to increase and provide a solid workout, while the strengthening poses help build muscle tissue. A psychological dimension to the workout promotes relaxation and tapping into one's own power to create happiness from within. A gentle, wonderful, and easy-to-use resource, Yoga for Weight Loss is a choice supplementary pick for fitness DVD libraries. 53 minutes. Also highly recommended specifically for expecting and new moms is ""Prenatal & Postnatal Yoga"" ($14.98, 69 minutes) hosted by Elena Brower."
5,Peaceful,Ashely Turner has a very calm and soothing voice which is nice. The moves are somewhat difficult for a beginner but I know in time it will get easier. She is outside of a home overlooking the ocean-very peaceful.
3,Great Scenery....Average DVD,This DVD has moves that are simple easy enough to perform...and hard enough to give you a good workout but nothing out of the ordinary.
4,Decent workout,"Good workout; definitely work up a sweat. Lots of lower body focus. Just not as beautiful and awe-inspiring as some of the Gaiam dvd's are, e.g., Rodney Yee, Shiva Rea."
3,good for beginners/intermediate yoga practice,"She does a nice job explaining what to do. Yet, I find it hard to believe this is a weight loss yoga dvd. I don't feel like I burned any extra calories doing this yoga practice, perhaps it is because I have been doing yoga for several years now. I think it should be named something like 'relaxing yoga' or 'calming yoga'. I felt good after this yoga, but not like I had a strenuous workout. If you are looking to calm yourself and stretch, this is a fine dvd. If you want to burn lots of calories, you should select something else. I personally felt like I burned more calories with her power yoga dvd. Jillian Michael's yoga meltdown probably burns more calories, but that one is shorter and not as great for stretching."
3,It's OK,"I was rather turned off by the instructor's bragging on the video - she is an expert who works with celebrities, she has a unique approach and she has a master's in counseling psychology. All this does not seem very relevant - I just want to exercise and not listen to how great she is. There is nothing unique about the workout - it contains pretty standard ashtanga poses I do every week in my yoga class. Some poses are held longer than usual or repeated more but that's about it. It is a useful workout but there are other yoga DVDs I like much better."
2,to much talk not a lot of movement,"I was so excited when I finally received this in the mail, however, I was very disappointed after pushing play. I thought I was going to get a great work out and learn some new moves but I did not. The time flew by but I felt like there was more talking then yoga. Her voice is very soothing and she inspires you to have confidence and patience with your body but definitely not a yoga dvd for weight loss. As soon as you feel your body getting warm and you think your beginning to push your muscles shes stops to relax and breath. This is a good dvd for a quick morning power trip or once a week body boost, not something to workout to"
3,Too Philosophical,Good workout but too much Philosophical mumbo jumbo- I just can't keep from being annoyed by it. If you are into that part of it then go ahead and enjoy it.
5,I love this workout!,This program is great. It's not easy or super difficult; many of the sequences can be modified to accommodate your level.
4,Good instructor,"As all Yoga instructional vehicles are, it is a long and more involved than what I need. But, I'd recommend it."
1,Junk,I've tried these in a few different grits. They wear very quickly and they tear very easily. Find something else. You'll regret purchasing this item.
1,Prisoner Of Zenda,I regret that I am dissatisfied with this product. It was sold 'as new' but had scratches and has only English and Chinese subtitles. The subtitle (English) was horrible. Many words did not match the spoken words in the film. It seems to be a Chinese copy of poor quality.
5,Funniest 90s tv show ever!!,THIS SHOW IS DOWN RIGHT HILARIOUS. I LOVE ALL OF THE SEASONS AND OWN SEASONS 1-3. I CAN'T WAIT FOR SEASON 4 TO COME OUT!!!!YES YES YES!!!!!
1,Service of getting Fourth Edition of Prince of BelAir,I am very disappointed to report that this product never arrived. I rate this as poorly as I possibly can.
5,Ready for Season Five!,I love Fresh Prince of Bel Air and have all of the first four seasons which are great! I had forgotten some of the hilarious episodes! I just wish and hope season five would come out soon! We're anxiously awaiting the release!
3,"Contents OK,, but no english subtitles","This is a cheap product. The discs and boxes are OK, but there are no english sutitles (only portuguese and french) Minimal program is not there... I wouldn't have bought these had I known! The series is still funny though on its last leg. The plot is wearing thin... But my boy loves it, so what the H..."
2,"Arrived fast, but....","This item arrived with the other DVDs I ordered for a birthday gift. However the person I gave it to just opened the Fourth Season DVD and found that the second DVD was broken. Disappointing, especially since I gave it as a birthday gift."
1,Just Sad,"When I started watching the DVDs, the first one started skipping and freezing. I thought it was my DVD player so I put the second one in, same thing. I grabbed a DVD from a different season I purchased prior and from a different company and the DVD worked fine. All four discs I purchased in this order (season four) were messed up, freezing and skipping. I am NOT happy about this."
5,So Funny!,Will Smith will never be out of style. Every time I see an episode I see the mature Will Smith doing the role of a young kid. That is why this Will always be a classic in my DVD collection.
5,"If I had to pick just one cookbook, this would be it.","This is an extraordinary cookbook. It has recipes to tempt every palate. If I had to pick just one cookbook to own, this would be the one.The recipes in this book are clear and easy to follow, and in addition, Ms. Hazan tells us about ingredients, which kind of eggplant is best, what kind of pasta would be tasty, etc. She also has sections on technique, such as how to make pasta. These recipes are the kind you can make and make again and not get sick of them. There are many simple yet extremely tasty dishes, such as my favorite, smothered onion pasta sauce.Truly, this is a great cookbook that everyone should have. I can give it no greater recommendation, except to say that I shall be living abroad for half a year and only have room for a few books, and this is one of the few I'm taking."
4,Great Cooking Made Easy,"This is one of the best cookbooks.Many of the recipes are simple to prepare, have few ingredients, and taste great. We've found many new uses for produce from our garden, great soups, pasta sauces, etc. Highly recommended.I could hardly put this book down. [...]"
3,great historical perspective,"but a great disappointment from a timing and ingredient quantities in over 50% of the recipes. I chose this book as an introduction to Italian cooking and have loved the historical notes and techniques. In fact I have incorporated many into my everyday kitchen. Also a great reference for classical menus.But I do not trust her portion amounts or ingredient amounts.Would I buy again knowing this, probably yes after I had done other reading."
5,Best cookbook ever!,"I have well over 1,000 cookbooks and this is the one that I use the most. The recipes are well written and easy to follow. The ingredients are easily accessible - in fact I usually have most things in my cupboards. Every recipe that I have tried in this book has worked prefectly. When looking at some of the recipes there seem to be so few ingredients that you wonder just how tasty the finished dish is going to be, however because of the techniques used you are NEVER disappointed. Just to give you some idea of how much I have cooked out of this book, I have cooked every fish or seafood recipe except for 3! My two favourite recipes in the book are the Mussel Soup and the Tomatoless Osso Bucco. If you are looking for a good Italian cookbook this is it."
5,Puro Italiano,"I cook from this book every night, and I give it to everyone I know. My Italian husband was skeptical at first because the recipes are in English (!), but he and his parents no longer tease, particularly after the time his mother ""improved"" Marcella's recipe for gnocchi di semolina and they didn't hold their shape. If you want to eat the same food the Italians are eating, buy this book and cook some up!"
4,"Very good techniques, but not the flavor I expected","The book is very well written and it teaches very good techniques for cooking wich gives more flavor to the food. I have tried several of the recipes following the instructions as exactly as I could, but I am a bit dissapointed because they did not seem to me very tasty. I expected to obtain results similar or equal to the dishes you have at Italian restaurants, but there are only, perhaps,a few of them. However, the flavor is not bad either, and I love the techniques given, is just that I expected more."
3,Underwhelmed,"I know I'm supposed to like this book. There are over a hundred reviews here telling me so. Yet after having tried a number of recipes my reaction is 'meh.' The vaunted tomato sauce with onion? Plain and boring. The much-admired pork cooked in milk? How many people have actually prepared it successfully? The recipe for fava beans wherein they are cooked in their skins (i.e., shelled but unpeeled)? That's weird. I'm not trying to be difficult. I revere Julia Child as much as the next guy (and consider her Mastering the Art of French Cooking to be a sterling model). But I find serious lapses of taste here or, another and perhaps more likely possibility, some deficiencies in the recipes themselves and their explanation of technique. In short, this isn't a book I often use."
2,Disappointed,"My expectations for this book were sky high after reading the feedback from the majority of the reviewers. Sadly, I have not found many recipes in the book that I enjoy. The recipes are repetitive and mostly mundane. This may be traditional but it is uninspiring. I also find that her use of fats (butter, heavy cream, etc.) is a bit over the top for my taste. I do appreciate her writing style which is very pleasing and easy to read. The lack of pictures hurts. A few personal favorites from the book: tomato sauce with porcini mushrooms, chicken with two lemons, and the bolognese meat sauce."
2,Overrated,"I am an experienced cook and have been cooking Italian food for a long time. Many of the recipes in this book I have prepared more successfully from other Italian cookbooks. Marcella is unduly fussy and opinionated. She insists on cooking mince in milk for spaghetti bolognaise because of the acidity of the wine and tomatoes. It makes no difference; other reliable sources for true Bolognaise have never insisted on this. She derides North American ""Italaian"" sausage as anything but and enjoins her readers never to prepare any of sausage dishes with sausage containing fennel seeds. Such sausage probably did originante with an Italian cook, perhaps a family recipe. How it came to be called ""Italian"" sausage in America is anyone's guess. I think it's very tasty and adapatable. Her caramelized carrots will scorch too easily if one is not too careful. And her roasts that I have tried in a Creuset pot were not spectacular."
5,My desert island cookbook,"This is a reissue under one cover of two wonderful cookbooks with some excellent additions. The recipes are generally quite simple and beautifully organized. Make the self-basting roast chicken, the simple tomato sauce, the pork cooked in milk, the pasta with sausage and cream, the spinach and ricotta pasta, the sublime bolognese sauce, etc, etc.The bolognese is not simple, but it is worth it. It is best if you let it cool to room temperature and then reheat it before serving it. Twice a year I make three recipes and freeze them.Ever wonder how to use left over pasta? Use it as the base for Marcella's fritata recipe.This cookbook taught me to cook."
5,My all-time favorite cookbook...,"This is definitely my favorite cookbook ever. I use it all the time, and still haven't even tried about 3/4 of the recipes...there are just so many! It is true that some of the recipes require ingredients that are hard to find here (though I was able to make some of the recipes I can't make here while i lived in Italy). Still, there are plenty to choose from that are relatively fast, very easy, and use ingredients that are readily available in the U.S. Some of my favorite meat dishes, vegetable dishes and pasta sauces come from this book. Two thumbs up!"
5,The Best Italian cookbook ever,"Marcella Hazan's cookbooks are all great. This is the BEST. The characteristic that sets her book apart from all others is not the ingredients and not lucious looking pictures (there are no photos), but rather the important processes she describes in clear detail. I bought this as a gift for someone but have owned this version for five years and its earlier edition for 25 years and have never been disappointed. She is the best. Period. You'll never need another Italian cookbook."
5,The Perfect Italian Cookbook,"This is not a cookbook that is filled only with recipes. Marcella Hazan spends the first 50 or so pages giving you an intimate lesson in Italian cooking techniques and the correct use and preparation of ingredients. You don't know what a soffrito is? After this book you'll know what it is and why it is important to the dish.Marcella Hazan has been giving cooking classes for many years and this book (her second) shows us why she has gotten rave reviews for many decades.There are plenty of recipes and when necessary there are very informative hand-drawn illustrations, showing how to prep the artichoke or shape the gnocchi."
2,Pass (on) the salt,"Much as I love Italian food and the preparation thereof, I often find this book frustratingly unclear in its recipes.It is also very old-fashioned as far as nutrition goes. For example, if prepared to the book's specifications, many dishes we tried tasted overwhelmingly salty to us--and we don't generally even make a conscious effort to avoid salt in our diets."
2,Not at all what I expected,"From the rave reviews this cook book has gotten both here and elsewhere I had thought that I was buying the best Italian cookbook on Earth. Unfortunately, I was wrong. This book may be wonderful to some, but it's certainly not what I was looking for. Out of the whole book I found maybe 2 or 3 recipes that I MAY try and that's about it. Great book if you're looking for Italian seafood recipes, which I was not. Tastes may differ, but for me this purchase was a disappointment.If you're looking for recipes as basic as what this cookbook offers, just do a couple searches on google."
3,Learning to Cook Italian,I ordered this book after reading an article in a magazine. I was interested in Marcella and her italian recipies. I have not had a chance to try any of the recipies yet since I ordered it during the holiday season but am looking forward to it.There is plenty of good information in the book.
5,Get it and don't change a thing!!,"Okay people, it's simple. Buy the book, follow the recipes as written and don't change a thing!!! I have been to Italy 9 times in my life and I can say with great confidence that this book represents the true nature of Italian cooking. If modifying recipes is your thing please don't buy this book. It's a masterpiece and is not created for those who feel the need to try and re-create a masterpiece."
5,The one cookbook you should own,"If you have only one cookbook, as other reviewers have also said, this is the one to have. The best thing about this book is that absolutely every recipe turns out wonderfully. I own lots of cookbooks and am often on the epicurious website and must say that that is very rare. I have made about half the recipes in the book and hope to finish all of them within the next year. A winner!"
5,A Goddess in the Kitchen,"What can I say that hasn't already been said? This woman (and some italian friends) have taught me anything I know italian food. Combining the two vols. is brilliant and, if there weren't any other reason, the recipe for pasta w/chicken liver sauce would make the price worth it. Marcella: I wan't to have your baby! xoxox"
5,"Excellent primer for beginners, but does have mistakes","In the beginning, she cites all the features required for an inkle loom. I used this list to search for mine, and have been delighted with the loom I got. She also has great instructions for getting set up, and for weaving.The only problem I've noticed is that if you follow exactly many of the charts, you will not get the results shown in the samples. Left of the center of the graph is perfect. The right hand side is always off by one. I had to learn this the hard way, and so now, I check that left and right of the center are identical, and then fix the chart before I begin warping my loom."
3,"Unfortunately, you don't have many other options for Inkle weaving.","While other reviewers found the author's writing style ""clear,"" I did not. References go nowhere, instructions are either over- or under-written, etc.; the book is a plethora of mistakes. My biggest complaint is that while technique sequences have numbers, the numbers aren't included in the written instructions. Why have numbers if they aren't going to provide a link to what you're suppose to do! (Then there was the reference to ""Chapter 10"" when there isn't a Chapter 10 in the book.) I can forgive a few editing errors, but this book has too many of them. The author clearly knows how to weave, she just needs an editor/co-author who knows how to write clearly and effectively."
4,Historical weaving,Great beginner book on inkle weaving. It has helped us in setting up the loom to weave our first straps for historical bags that weare quite proud of.
4,A weaver's classic!,"Almost everything you need to know about inkle weaving is right here. Good illustrations, descriptions and diagrams. One of the very best on the subject."
4,"Quick Service, Just as described!","Fact of the matter it was a regular on-line purchase. I found the item at a great price, bought it and recieved it.I did get a e-mail telling me that it was in stock and had be pulled, I recieved another when it had been shipped with a tracking number. But I guess that I am old fashioned in that I think no matter what I buy I should have those services. When I sell online through a ""auction"" site or a ""related interest site"" I always provide those for my customers.SO, would I use the vendor again, YES, definitely!"
5,The best synopsis is on iUniverse.com,"I didn't trust a new writer, so I went onto the publishers website, iUniverse.com and found that I could review the synopsis there. I could also view the first three chapters. It intrigued me, and I purchased the book. I'm glad I did. So, for all of you people who doubt what your buying, and want to get to the story before you purchase it, see the publishers website. You can review it from there."
5,This Book Was The Best I've Read In A Long Time!,I hadn't heard of this author before coming into amazon.com. I want to tell you that I was certainly surprised by Fatal Impact. I never realized that an unknown writer could create such a suspense and as far as I'm concerned I hope she writes more. I loved the book and anyone else reading this should make the purchase. You won't be sorry.
5,Better than most,I especially enjoyed the writing style. It was a well thought out story and should make a great screenplay. I always like to read them before I see them.
5,I love it!,"My kids and I love listening to this audiobook. Each author had a different take on the story they were reading and my kids seemed to respond to all of them, especially Kevin Bacon!The Arthur series is always enjoyable and with the proceeds going to charity, you can't go wrong with this purchase. I recommend it highly!"
4,Tom Riddle,Nice figure with great detail.Our son loves it and it is a nice addition to his collection.
3,"nostalgic, but you had to be there!","Fun memories, missed hearing about Dirty John's rather than The New Way Lunch... no guts, no glory. Would like to find another copy as a gift because I won't share mine."
5,Master cylinder gasket.,Got this to replace a worn one on a 2006 G-6. Fit was perfect. I have found that most items from Dorman HELP are good OEM replacements.
3,dolphin swim mask and snorkel,"We are novices with snorkels, so maybe this is true of all of them. But I found this one hard to make water tight on my 5 year old. Adjusting the straps before putting it on proved impossible as it didn't stretch enough. So it had to be adjusted while on his face, and frequently loosened or slipped the stoppers in the process. Once I got them on my son after quite some time, I hoped he wouldn't take them off and the process would have to start all over again. Once on, he had a blast!"
1,"It's made of styrofoam, do not buy. I cant believe it is even listed at this price.","Please read the description on this cooler, it is made of Styrofoam. I can't believe that it is even listed at this price. What a scam."
3,Not Bad But Nothing Different,"Even for 1995, this is a fairly unoriginal collection by one of Journey's main contributors. His redo of ""Faithfully"" does nothing new for the song, nor does it enhance the original recording. ""Back to the Innocence"" and ""Baptism Day"" are fairly decent, but overall it's a so-so effort. I can see why he's sticking to instrumental CDs these days; he is an EXCELLENT keyboardist."
3,Songwriter Cain,"Jonathan Cain is a phenomenal songwriter. He has written for many aritists in the musical industry: Cher - Starting Over, Kenny Rogers - Thought of Losing You, Jimmy Barnes - Too Much Love Ain't Enough, Michael Bolton - Wait On Love, too name a few. Journey was cut down in their PRIME! So, what remains are songs that were written for JRNY, but, landed with other artists. This CD included. There not too many singers out their singing like the lead singer from JRNY. So, key changes are lowered. Arrangements are rearranged. But, I think what will always remain with Cain is the uplifting flight of each song."
4,Very nice black open-toe pump,"I really like these shoes! The look is very current, kind of fun, while still professional enough to be able to wear them with a lot of different outfits. I think they will be a very versatile addition to my closet. I will also say for anyone who sometimes needs a slightly wider shoe (I usually buy most of my shoes at Payless because I can get more things in the wide width there), I was pleasantly surprised by the fit of these open-toed pumps. They fit comfortably on my feet. The satin-like fabric would not be my first choice, but they don't look too overly dressy."
5,Lime Pickle Relish,"I have been looking all over for this product. It is wonderful on chicken and pork, and even on a slice of cheese. It is a family favorite and always a good conversational piece as to what a different taste it has buy how yummy!"
4,Good contemporary gospel,"This album is great. Eventhough it's a little dated, you can't tell. I haven't found another gospel cd that has made me want to listen to it over and over again. I'm glad I've found it. And I'm glad to know that there are other albums by the same group. Keep on singing.Gabrielle Finley"
5,Excellent Purchase,"This was an excellent purchase. The product arrived very quickly. The product was in excellent condition, ""just like new"". Would definitely do business with this seller again. This seller is highly recommended in my book. Thanks a lot for the great and expedient service."
2,I believe this was a well intentioned DVD...,"I think if one is Messianic and of either a Jewish or Christian background, yagotta sympathize with the person or people making this DVD. So commonly wehave had to struggle with letting go of things that are part of ""thetraditions of men"", for example if you were a Christianhaving Passover instead of Easter, Hannakah instead ofChristmas and Christmas trees and...if you were Jewish,discontinuing things like kippas and accepting the""authority"" of the Talmud. That is what mademe not be able to give this DVD more than 2 stars, the kippas, the quotingof the Talmud and other ""traditions of men"" are present right along with the trulyauthentic Torah and ""New"" Testament parts of Scripture in this visual recording ofof a Passover seder. In the Torahwe are told to neither subtract from, nor add to, it. How long it takes most (all?) of usto see the beautiful simplicity, and utter seriousness, of those warnings from YHWH."
5,Soldiers of fortune,Anyone who buys this product and develops the discipline to do exactly what Dave Ramsey instructs you to do will be a millionaire by the time you retire. The math is simple. The only question is how many times over will you become a millionaire. If you are starting late and have debt you will still become financially at peace and living comfortably at retirement.
3,Chasing real life.,"The main character of this novel, Gimpei, chases unsuccessfully young girls with eyes like a lake. His father also drowned in a lake.The lake is a symbol for life. Gimpei is chasing real life, but can't conquer it. His deformed feet, soiled by all possible infamies of the world, are a symbol of his Sisyphus run.He abandons a prostitute with a child.This novel with an unsympathetic protagonist is captivating because of its poetic vigour.A minor work."
2,Very Disappointing,"I think that unless I'd read on the dust jacket that Kawabata was a Nobel Prize winner I wouldn't have known it from this book (I haven't read his others so I don't know how they compare). I found the story to be very uninvolving, although mercifully short. It seemed to have the worst dreary aspects of Knut Hamsun (also a very overrated writer), and I definitely wouldn't suggest it to anyone wishing to introduce themselves to Japanese literature.I recommend Yukio Mishima or Akira Yoshimura's ""Shipwrecks"" instead."
3,Torn between the pop/punk thing going on here,"I picked this up out of faith of Roger Miret and Agnostic Front and pretty much got what I expected-Oi punk, rock'n'roll. There are some decent hooks abound but sometimes I can't help but feel this music almost borders on pop/punk. ""Radio"" is one in which I don't exactly understand what exactly the lyrics are pointing towards, but I can guess that it means he's sick of the [music] playing on radio today (Amen!). However some of this does sound like what I would hear on the radio. I understand the want to bring punk rock back to its basics sometimes, but I have to say I prefer the energy of AF back in the days of ""Liberty and Justice"".All in all, a good solo start for Miret."
1,NEW THERE WAS A GIMMICK,I PUSCHASED THIS FOR MY NIECE. THE PICTURE LOOKED FINE. WHEN THE BAG ARRIVED IT WAS DAMMAGED THE TAG THAT SAYS ROCAWEAR IS DAMMAGED. THATS WHY THESE BAGS ARE SO CHEAP.I GUESS THATS WHAT I GET FOR GETTING SOMETHING FOR SO CHEAP. THIS BAG IS FLIMSEY AND TORE APPART IN SHIPPING I RECOMMEND DO NOT BUY.
3,"Deisgned fo a particular task, not for the masses..","As a graduate of MMI, I know the book well. It was designed to supplement the lecture given in the first 6 weeks of school. It was written at a very basic level, since many MMI students have no prior experience (that's why they're in school), and students would be overwhelmed by too much technical information in the first 6 weeks of what is 13 months of training. The book is not useful as an informational tool for a non-student, and is priced high due to limited distribution (check the price of an average college textbook- same reason.) The book is the right tool for it's intended application (the MMI beginning student), but the wrong tool for anything else."
3,So So,It was an interesting story but a so so book. The characters were awkward. They were stereotypes. The conclusions about persons who have been victims of sexual abuse made me uncomfortable. It will make a great film though. I might read another from this author.
4,Liked this One the Best so Far....,"I've read about 5 or 6 of Ms. Gardner's books and I definitely like this one the best. Unfortunately, I read Hide first, so it completely ruined this book, because the whole backstory of Catherine and Bobby is written about in Hide.Some of the plot is a bit over the top, like believing that Catherine could orchestrate the killing of her husband, and that Catherine is just soooo beautiful that she can manipulate everyone with her sex appeal. However, other aspects of the book, i.e., Nathan's illness, Richard Umbrio's role, Jimmy Gagnon's family, etc, kept my interest and it ended up being a good read."
4,"Quick, easy and enjoyable",This was my first Lisa Gardner and it won't be my last. It was very easy to read. I didn't want to put it down and finished it in a day.
2,"If you like clever, well written mysteries, skip this nonsense.","The book starts out promisingly, with a taut and suspenseful chapter about a sniper in a dangerous situation with an abusive husband threatening his wife and child. And for a while, I thought it might be a good read, but it became sillier and sillier, with paper thin characters. I just couldn't feel anything for them or even get a grasp on them. Also, the story became more outrageous with every page. I can see why people liked it, but it's a shallow, quick read, a la James Patterson."
4,Exciting story line,"I truly enjoyed this book, the characters came to life as the story progressed. There was love, hate, murder, incest it goes on and on."
2,Again?,"A week before reading this book, I finished reading The Survivors Club.As I listened to this book, I was instantly struck by commonalities between both books. 1. Convicted pedophile gets out of jail and is hellbent on exacting revenge on the one victim he let live. 2. There's a behind-the-scenes person who is paying for the carnage that follows. 3. The beautiful ""victim"" and the dutiful cop who thinks she's beautiful. 4. The dutiful cop goes rogue in the process of helping the damsel in distress.Maybe if I'd read these books years apart, I might have enjoyed both books. As it happens, I mildly enjoyed the Survivors Club and was bored by this one."
3,Entertaining,"This book is a quick read, a suspenseful book. It's a good beach book, you could maybe see Jason Statham in a movie of this book. It it's no literary masterpiece but it is entertaining. Quickly forgotten though."
4,Good read at a great price!,"This book was entertaining, if not the best I've read. But for the price, well worth downloading! It held my interest and was easy reading. Perhaps not the best of her books, but definitely not the worst. If you like mystery/thriller books, this one fits the bill. And with a little surprise at the end. I recommend it!"
4,ALONE,"This was the first book I downloaded on my new Kindle, and finished it in a day and 1/2! I couldn't put it down. If you like mysteries, with plot twists, this book is for you."
3,Good book but drug out,This was a good book with a good plot but there was too much blah blah blah in parts that could have been more exciting. It didn't make me want to stop everything I was doing to keep reading and find out what happened next but all in all it was a good book just a little long.
4,Starts off with a bang and keeps going,"This book starts with action right away... which I enjoy. I was getting frustrated (in a good way) with trying to tie it all together the who what and why's before the author gave them to you. It wasn't so easy which is what makes this a good murder mystery action book, not easily guessed. I think it's strange this is considered a Detective DD Warren novel when she played such a small role in the book. But I look forward to reading more of her and from Lisa Gardner.PS was a steal on Kindle for .99 (way back when I purchased it) sad news means I will spend more cause it was good writing. :)"
5,Analyze This!,"How do you make a psycho-thriller even more of a thriller? You add in a State Trooper that is a sharpshooter, a widow that is drop dead gorgeous with an extreme amount of excess baggage, and a small 4-year old boy that is deathly ill of some disease no one can quite figure out. You stir in a serial killer, a set of in-laws that should be outlaws and you have a recipe for a grip your seat ride into Bobby's personal hell. The producers of Criminal Minds would appreciate this tale of terror. Read it - you won't be disappointed."
3,alone. i felt alone.,lisa gardner is an excellent writer. i enjoyed this book. at times i felt anxious and couldnt wait to kee reading. but i was also left wanting resolution to one scene before a new storyline began. multiple storylines are good. back stories are good. they dont have to be all at the same time.
2,Uh...Okay,"This quick read didn't capture my interest. The plot elements were all there: suspense, scary twist, thriller ending, unanticipated motives but at the end I still went, ""Uh... okay."" Gardner wasn't able to weave my interest into her story. I love a good thriller to shake up my reading list but I won't be looking for any more of hers."
4,Alone book,I've always liked Lisa Gardner. She always keep me guessing till the end. The suspense is always there which makes me read faster...
4,Great Read,"Fast paced, climatic, Suspenseful. Hard to put down until every page is read. Great casting of characters and intriguing plot with plenty of twists that will keep you guessing. 4 1/2 stars all the way! Will be looking for more of Gardner's books!"
4,good read,"very good book, told through the viewpoint of Bobby instead of D.D., so it makes a typical Lisa Gardner plot have a different twist. Liked the difference"
2,Ridiculous Book,I thought this was a horrible book that was hard to put down but painful to read. Skip it and buy something that is quality writing!!!
4,"Fun Quick Read, My First Kindle Book","I just got the kindle and saw this in the number one spot, so I gave it a shot.Its a quick paced murder mystery that keep you engaged. This is the first book that I have ever read by Lisa, but I will be checking out her others."
4,A Great Read!,"Read this book in 2 days. The story and characters quickly drew me in and I couldn't put it down. I found that Lisa Gardner added enough deviant, dark, sadistic human behavior to keep me interested but not enough to gross me out! Keep these $.99 thrillers coming."
3,Disappointing,"Lisa Gardner is a competent writer and that shows in this novel. It reads well. The writing is professional. A quick run-down on the plot is that Officer Dodge, a police sniper, shoots a man during a hostage situation. He is then suspended from the police. The plot probably gets overly complex and convoluted to the point of getting difficult to follow in spots, and I am not at all sure the motivations of the dead husband's family is credible. I didn't really find it so. But that wasn't my biggest problem with the novel. The biggest problem was that none of the characters is likable, or even sympathetic, including the protagonist.Eventually, you want some character in the whole thing who you at least feel some empathy about or at least care about a little bit. I never found one. By the end, my reaction was, ""Who cares?"""
1,unrelenting,"Unrelenting and depressing, this book has a rather hateful female lead and a pathetic masochistic hero. Do Not Recommend."
1,It's Good To Know Even Best Selling Authors Can Suck,"Usually, I give the 99 cent book a break. Because usually, it's being offered by a new/upcoming/indie or once traditionally published author, now taking their career (and money!) into their own capable hands.But.I gave Alone one star because from a 'best selling' author, this was a hot steaming mess.I couldn't even finish it. She took paragraphs and paragraphs to describe the most boring details.During the police action, I felt like I was reading a manual on tactical operations. A very dry manual that felt like a noose around my neck.I remember reading Gardner years ago. And now I remember why I no longer bother!Save your 99 cents!"
1,Barely worth the $.99,"So convoluted that I ended up not even caring who did it. For me, the author just through too many subplots in without really developing them. Then she would go off on tangents describing minute details that added NOTHING to the plot. Very disorganized and hard to get into."
4,Excellent read!,"I was surprised to find this book was so good from beginning to end. This is the first book by Lisa Gardner I've read and did not know what to expect. I read a lot of mystery thrillers and this is one of the best. It is not formula driven and is exciting at every turn. The characters are real and interesting and she keeps you guessing all the way to the end. I will be reading more of her books, no question."
2,Very disappointed,"I've read many of Lisa's books and was very disappointed in this one. There were far too many surprise complications in this book. And it was not cohesive. It flew all over the place I read it all, hoping---- too bad!"
4,A good read,"This book kept me guessing all the way through. I enjoyed this read very much! I rarely recommend books, but this one is worth it. Read it."
3,Not Her Best,"I like Lisa's books, but I had a hard time with this one. I really enjoyed Hide! This was just off somehow. It was ok, but the storyline seemed to drag on and on with not a lot of action. I found myself bored at times. I did finish it and will still read her books...I think she is a great author!"
3,"Chic ""Dick""","While this book is well written from a certain perspective, it's clearly more relevant for women. It lacks the insight into what is mostly a man's world. I know, I know, this ain't PC, but I mean it with real sincerity, and without malice. I think women will appreciate it as a well written mystery/crime/detective story, but the men will find it a bit lacking from the perspective of what dealing with a real world situation would be like. A bit too much drama, and not too believable because of it. Certainly, a fun, easy read."
4,"Pretty Good, but...",...I downloaded for either .99 or 1.99 but I see it's now $8.00! I guess we need to really shop around before buying.
3,It was an OK story,I thought this book just had too many coincidences....I thought it was an OK book. But would not recommend it to a friend.
2,Overrated,"I really have a hard time believing this is one of the bestsellers on Kindle store. Reading this book is like watching a cliché, everyday movie.Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying there's a strong sense of visualization here. More like a ""been there, done that"" kind of feel. You have watched and read so many movies/books like this; believe me, you don't need another one. Actually, you're being bombarded with stuff like this pretty much all the time, mostly even when you don't want to.I should admit, the $0.99 price tag fooled me. I thought I can't go wrong with that price. I was bitterly wrong. It's the worst $0.99 I've ever spent. Period."
2,Explicit Language,The book certainly was suspenseful. But we listened to it on an audio tape and I would estimate that there are over 30 F-Bombs in this book. It was offensive and disgusting. I wish she would have let the characters express themselves differently. I've never read a book that had worse language than this particular book. It was also extremely dark and depressing.
5,First time reading this author,"Alone is a non-stop ride of pulse-pounding action. From the minute Bobby pulls the trigger up until the very last page, Alone will keep you guessing and turning pages. Gardner is also very skilled in portraying her characters in a lifelike fashion. None of them are truly heroes and none of them (except for Catherine's rapist) are truly bad guys. She gives us someone to root for, Bobby Dodge, and plenty of other characters to try to figure out. The most intriguing character is Catherine Gagnon, who Gardner never labels and leaves it up to the reader to make a decision on.Alone provides readers with an interesting and tricky plot and also gives them the perfect characters to play it all out. This book is recommended to anyone who enjoys thrillers or mysteries."
4,Alone: Lisa Gardner,Good suspense story. Well written. Exciting! I've read two books from this author. Will read more. This was my first book read on my Kindle. You have to buy a Kindle.
2,big let down...,"This book was a big let down for me. Not what I'm used to from Lisa Gardner. Too many twists and turns at the very end, it kind of ruined it for me. The start was hard for me to get into, the middle was good, but the end was a flop."
3,Fast-paced But Dissatisfying,"Although I eagerly gobble up the books I can find by Lisa Gardner and enjoy them, this book disappointed me. The pacing and dialogue were fast and well-done, but somehow the characterizations left me completely cold. There wasn't a single character that elicited any extended sympathy, even Catherine. Stories have to draw some sympathy or empathy from the readers to at least one character for a real buy-in of the tale, but this book failed. I believe it was written to draw the reader into more than one character and make the reader care about him/her, but somehow that didn't happen. The protagonists were detached and often off-putting, and this decreased my interest and enjoyment."
3,Ho Hum,While I still love Lisa Gardner's writing style - every character in this book was so dysfunctional I couldn't care about any of them.
1,Agonizingly unreadable,"I have enjoyed Lisa Garnder's other books, and was very much looking forward to this one...to my great disappointment. Aside from the overwrought and completely unrealistic plot, I found none of the characters likeable. It was an exercise in self-torture to actually finish this book."
2,Blunder,"I just can't believe LS wrote these lines. I can't even call it a book. The main plot -there is a main plot?- Could be written in maybe twenty pages at most. The rest of the book is just a waste of paper and ink. In the epilogue you'll see that they thought who was the bad guy, but they never say why or how they thought who was he/her.Blunders:Who cares what happened with the psychologist? Were pages and pages talking Elizabeth with Bobby and if you skip all those chapters you'll miss nothing.How could the cops just accuse another cop - whom was always a very good cop - of confabulating a slaughter just because one of the cops has a hunch?How can the same cops accuse him of killing one of his friends - whom he also was a cop -?And the biggest:How is possible that a high Judge of the US Court became a judge and nobody knew he forged his marriage?If this were the first book I ever read from LG this would be also the last one. She made much better books than this one."
2,2.5 stars,"A pretty dumb book. I took it as an insult against survivors of child molestation; are we really to believe that Catherine would wind up evil because of her past? How many times did the author have to say the girl who climbed out of the hole was not the same girl who went in the hole...beat us over the head with it why don't you?And I honestly don't believe a judge could have THAT much power...and throwing in the incest story? Creepy and unnecessary.Also, why have Bobby break up with his girlfriend? What was the purpose of having her in the book then?I gave it an extra half star because it was an easy read, but other than that don't waste your time unless you like entirely unbelievable murder mysteries."
3,"It was just ""ok""","I thought that this book was just ""ok"". The premise was promising but it never really took off for me. I felt that it was repetitive and only touched the surface of the ""why's"" I'm all for a quick read, but I want there to be substance to it. The characters just never gripped me nor did I feel anything for them."
4,One word......Great!,"This book was a little confusing in the beginning but once you get into it, you can't put the book down. It's a never ending thrill ride. The only time you get to rest is when you actually put the book down. I read the book in less than 3 days. It's THAT good."
3,fine for the price,"Characters were stereotypical and fairly predictable as was the plot. For a fast read and for the price, not a bad book. But not great either. Like pop music, you read it and forget it."
5,Great to the Very End,"This book kept me riveted until the very last page. It is suspensful, scary and wonderfully written. The characters are people that could live next door and very believable. You will love it."
4,Must read,Great book. Very enjoyable to read. Interesting how all the different plots roll into one. Lisa Gardener did a great job on this piece
3,First Lisa Gardner For Me,"Alone: A Novel of SuspenseLots of twists and turns and some big surprises here. I did like the book, but it contained a little too much emphasis on sex for my taste. On the other hand, there is plenty of incest and pedophilia to go around in the story and that explains it. I can't figure out why Detective D.D. Warren is the heroine as she only appears a few times in the book; Bobby Dodge was a much more interesting character. I'm sure I will try the next book in the series but I hope the author doesn't continue to use sex in every plot."
4,Great book!,I simply bought this book because it got good reviews and it was only $.99. I thought it started off a little slow but the more iread the less I could actually put it down. This book definitely sucked me in and it was such a good deal! Would totally recommend it to a friend!
4,Alone,I enjoy reading Lisa Gardner suspense novels. Alone kept me interested until the end. I would recommend this book for anyone that is into suspense novel.
3,"Readable, with a Lifetime Movie Network kind of plot","A pretty good read, the book starts off with tension, and it keeps it up fairly well. There are twists and turns to the plot which held my interest, and the pacing was good. The main characters all had flaws, and there are some villains who are truly evil, and they pretty much get their due. A lot of the book was about a strong, beautiful, smart woman who just wants to be left alone, but she is being persecuted by an evil, powerful man - actually several evil powerful men. To be fair, it had a little more action and a little less anguished emotion than the typical Lifetime Movie, but a lot of it made it seem like I was watching the Lifetime network."
2,Wish I had read ALL the reviews before purchasing it on my Kindle,"I kept hoping this book would get better and have a point, but that never happened. Bobby Dodge was a good character, but the book kept getting more & more unreal to me."
2,Puhleeze......,A work of fiction can and should have some basis in reality. Fantasy on the other hand grows out of an improbable dream. This disappointing book does not fit either category.
2,"Good moments, but overall painful to read","Every so often, I read a book which leaves me feeling slightly off balance and ill. This was one of them. I missed the point and disliked the characters and I think I should have an MRI done to figure out why I finished it.I couldn't tell who the good people were and who the bad ones were, butI did like the therapist."
2,Not Her Best Work,"I'm a huge Lisa Gardner fan, but I thought that this was by far her worst book.Bobby was an idiot that I couldn't care less about. He did stupid things and thought with his other head. Catherine was just creepy, as were the rest of her family. The bad guy was nothing but a caricature. I can honestly say that by the time I got to the end, the only thing I cared about was the puppy surviving and finding a home.I hope her next book is better."
1,Stupendously Unrealistic,"This is the most completely unrealistic plot I have read in many years. I am aware of Poetic License, and suspended belief, or disbelief, but this one really violates the Pig Rule. A police sniper, paid to shoot to kill, gets prosecuted for doing his job. A judge has so much power and wealth(where do judges get wealthy?)that he virtually ruins the life of the sniper who shot his son. Give me a break. I don't know what world the author lives in, but in my world, this is total fantasy.Suspense is compelling because it is based on reality and rooted in experience.I'll stick to George Pelacanos or Michael Connolly.If this book wasn't in my Kindle, I'd have thrown it across the room."
1,Needs a Rating of Explicit language,"I really can't say anything about the book. I downloaded the free preview...It sounded like it was really interesting..Actually I read the 1st little bit and all was going well. Then the language started. I'm sorry, this may be a great book, but I will never know. I will not listen nor read such language. There are way too many adjectives that can be used to express oneself. This review is only for those who are offended by explicit language. As state before, this book may be fantastic, I for one will never know."
2,What happened?,"I like Lisa Gardner but this book was a total waste of my time.Bobby was an idiot who thought with what was between his legs, not between his ears. He did such inane, self-destructive things even though he knew Catherine was taking him for a ride. Catherine was totally unlikable. She was a manipulative, cold hearted user. But Bobby still followed her around like a lost puppy. She seemed a whole lot more worried about protecting her lifestyle than she did protecting her son.Glad I didn't pay full price for this one!"
1,A Snipers Manual,"I read the sample, three chapters which include a well researched description of how to sit up a sniper station. But I wasn't introduced to anyone I want to know more about."
5,WOW!!!,"My first novel by this author- I was totally surprised that I had not heard of her before this. Well written, never lost interest, highly recommend to any one that loves suspense."
5,WOW - Great Book!,"This was the first book I've read by Lisa Gardner and it was great! Your attention is grabbed at the very beginning of the story and keeps up the pace until the conclusion. I couldn't read it fast enough. I have ordered some other books by her and hope they are just as good. Full of suspense, mystery and intrigue - Just the way I like them. Definitely 5 Stars!"
2,Boring!,"I never thought that a thriller could be boring, but this one is. The characters are unsympathetic (especially the heroine; I would have expected to feel sorry for a survivor of sex abuse, but this woman gives me the chills); the plotline feels contrived.... I had to force myself to finish it."
3,Good read,"This was a good read. I am a fan of Lisa Gardner, and a fan of Bobby Dodge. DD Warren as well. This is a good book to read to pass some time."
2,Could have been much Better,"First as a FYI. This review is based of listening to the book as opposed to reading it.I didn't really like it. First, I didn't like the reader which of course has nothing to do with book. I liked the premise of the book; but too many things that I didn't agree with made it bad for me such as a judge reaching out to the defendent outside of court or the police. There were also other similar things; but I don't want to spoil too many things. In the end, I was just looking forward to the end."
4,giving the steig trilogys some competiton,read this in two days. i loved that it was so unpredictable. maybe a little sadistic and dark at times but still a great mysery.
5,YOU HAVE THE WRONG PICTURE TO GO TO THIS ALBUM.,"I AM NOT BEING CRITICAL, BUT THEIR HAS TO BE A SYSTEM ERROR. THANK YO"
5,An excellent read for anyone,"I read this trilogy while I was attending college 3 years agoand I can assure you several classes were missed as I read just onemore chapter. I found my attempt to finish each read at a resolved point was quite impossible and I ended up completing all three books within a few days. The way King hints at the fact that Rolands world is our own future gone awry is intriquing and almost depressing. Just enough mystery, magic and muscle for a good long read. (And a good long wait for the conclusion!)"
4,Enthralling! However the series remains STILL incomplete!!,"The series is a wonderful fantasy trip that will keep you on your toes and breathless as to what lies around every single turn. Great story lines and very easy to follow. However, the series (currently 3 books) remains unfinished! The ending of the last book is captivating.......... and nerve shattering when you have been waiting for over two years to find out the outcome of the potentially tragic situation for Roland and his traveling companions on Blane the Mono-Train. HEY! Mr. King, what gives? We enjoy your writing, so why the the torment?? And the wait goes on and on and on......"
5,Where is Volume 5?,"In my opinion, the Dark Tower Series is his BEST work yet! I have read them all more than a few times. But I need the next volume! It's like I'm in withdrawal. Please, someone,let me know when the next volume hits the shelf! P.S - WIZARD AND THE GLASS was really good."
5,"With King, words come to life.","What I enjoy most about the quest for the Dark Tower is the uncanny way the book comes to life all around you. Reading it is as if you have a front-row seat in a 3-d movie. Stephen King has a way of drawing on your powers of imagination like no one else can. If you don't believe this, go read 'It'(but read it in a well lit room).All I can say is that I check the web every day to see if part 5 is out."
3,Good enough to give you a king fix,"The books are fun to read. The story line meanders around a lot, but we are taling about steven king."
3,CHASEING THE MAN IN BLACK. BECAUSE I WANT TO.,"This book is not really a bad book. It's really confuseing at times and it takes place in a different world that it dosen't tell you about. but it's got some good action and freindship in it, like when he find's Jake the little boy in the desert and they become good freinds.So for a final review of this book it's good if you like stephen king...But for the man in black the second main character he's really the god in the story and he shows the gunslinger the way his life woeld have been if he would'nt have died and went to a different world."
1,An incomplete effort shows lack of respect for readers,"It's not that this is a bad book, or that any of the books in the series so far are untenably bad, but the fact that this series remains unfinished after 20 years is absolutely unforgiveable. The Gunslinger was first published in 1982, it is now 2002, and in the intervening years, King has published no less than 36 other novels and collections. King obviously has no commitment to this story, and that has shown in the last couple of books. They are just words down on paper, dragging the story along, without life or passion.If you are the kind of person who would willingly buy a movie ticket, and upon the film breaking in the middle, get up and go home with never another care about how the movie ended, then by all means read these books. However, if you're the kind of reader who gets drawn into stories and actually interested in characters, then I'd suggest passing on these books until King decides if he's ever going to finish the story."
5,An avid reader of books.,"I have been reading since I was in first grade, so it's nothing new to me when I get asked about my opinion on a book. Frankly, my mother never let me read Stephen King's works until I was 13. Ever since then, I have tried every book I could get my hands on. I have read all four of the Dark tower series... though not all from the same edition because the artwork was different. I find the stories intriguing and spellbinding. This is going to be an excellent series upon completion, not that it isn't now. I was surprised that the trademark horror aspect of his writing came out less, but it was still potent reading. The descriptions and details he puts into it are amazing and I would recommend this set of books for anyone who has doubted the power behind the man that is Stephen King."
5,The Dark Tower draws more than Roland and his friends,"The Dark Tower series is amazing. There is no better way to put it. King uses colorful descriptions to hold the reader captivated as he does in all his books. This wonderful combination of fantasy, science fiction, and modern times creates an ongoing story that the reader will never be able to put down. In short, I Love this series, and it will stand as my all time favorite. Although it would be difficult to choose, I would pick ""Wizard and Glass,"" as the best book so far. Roland's love story is the main reason I felt obliged to read the entire series a second time. I wait in anticipation of the fifth book."
5,NOTHING LIKE IT!,"From the very first page you're plunged into the story. You become almost instantly attached to Roland and everything that's happening to him. It's an emotional series, one that will make you laugh and cry and bite your nails waiting for what's going to happen next. It's so very real that sometimes you'll have to ask yourself, ""Is Stephen really writing this - or is something else telling him.."""
3,It might be by Stephen King but it does not read like one.,This book was very indecisive in the writing. It had great detail in the describing of the character. The author would not say names until he talked about the person or character for a few pages. That is what confused me the most. Yet it is a good book; if you like Stephen King's writing you will like this book.
5,These book are VERY good,"I just finished reading ""The waste lands"" It was a great book. They just keep getting better and better. These books have helped broaden my sense of knowledge and wisdom. You come to love the characters, from Roland, the strange gunslinger from a dying world, all the way down the that stupid billy bumbler Jake carries around. These books are great, and I hope Stephin King isn't dead, so he can keep writing these great novels."
5,One of the Greatest Fanatasies in a long time...,"This book brings out King's creative talents by combining many different worlds, time lines, and characters in a single story with amazing detail and flow of story. Not only is it a fantasy but a horror, mystery, and even a romance. Its worth the time and money to read this book trilogy and I hope it will be completed one day."
5,Spellbinding,"Some of the best fiction I have ever read. Stephen King has an insight to my needs and expectations as a reader. I highly recommend all three books and anticipate further books of similar nature, suspence, and taste."
5,"OUTSTANDING,THE BEST,HAVE READ EACH BOOK THREE TIMES SO FAR.","All I can say is that I am hooked, addicted. Ilove all of the KINGS books but this series is byfar the best. Will someone please let me know when the next book will be on sale. I have read each book of this series three times each and can't wait for the next one."
5,"An epic, beyond belief !!!!!!!!!!","Fifty years from now, college students will line up to sign up for Shakespeare 101, and KING 101.!!! This is an epic tale that will stand the test of time. Bilbo and Frodo ""ain't got nothin"" on Roland, The Gunslinger.""There are other worlds than these"", you may find them through ""the door"" and do yourself a favor and read these books."
5,Stephen King's best,"I am a fan of all types of literature, and never before have I found anything that I liked as much as the Dark Tower series. I now think that Stephen King is a literary genius, and I have already reserved a copy of the Dark Tower IV."
5,GREAT! SUSPENSEFUL! WHERE'S THE FOURTH?,I LOVED it. I went through the three books in no time and now just waiting the fourth. These books are addictive and I want more. Hopefully soon...
5,King's best with sudden twists of alternate realities - GOLD,"King has always been known for his ""on the edge of your seat"" writing. His use of vivid imagery continues to twist tales of lost and imaginary worlds each with there own reality connected by the mysterious Dark Tower. Based on a gunslinger's painful quest, the reader can't help but be drawn into the worlds of Roland. This is an epic (spanning several decades in the development) that is sure to stand the test of time; even comparable to Tolkein's Lord of the Rings epic. Not for the faint at heart, yet somewhat removed from the normal King psychotic thrillers. A must read, especially for fantasy fanatics!!!"
5,They were very well written and I couldn't put them down.,"The Gunslinger was my most favorite of the three. I really like how Stephen King describes things in this book, so good that you can picture yourself in the scene with the characters. (Can't leave much of a review because I have to go, but the series were very well written and you should definately read them.)"
3,Fun but.....,I found the gunslinger dark tower to be a very good book but I wasn't able to grasp the story completely. I didn't know why he was following the man in black or why he wanted to go to the tower. I enjoyed the initial storyline but I couldn't fully appreciate where the story was going.
4,The Dark Tower,"""The man in Black fled across the desert,and the gunslinger followed"". Those spellbinding words make your imagination go wild. Atleast they did for me. I personally thought about those words for a good twenty minutes. While the whole class was reading I was thinking about the book, and those words impaticular. The rest of the book is just great, and I reccomend it to anyone who hasn't had the oppurtunity to read a great book.This was my very first book read from cover to cover.Believe it or not, and it wont be the last. I've watched many of Steven King's movies and in my opinion they are good, but is books are twice as good. I really like the way he introduces charachters, explains the plot, and I suggest this book to anyone."
5,"One of Kings best works, Next to the Talisman.","The Dark Towers first 3 installments of awe are a must read for any fantasy, servival, mystery, Horror, or just plain good book fan!! It has all the things you want in a good book: Love,Hate,Betrayl,gun fights,fist fights, Killer Mutated Lobsters and heartless villans, heartless goodguys, A wonderful story line, a magnificent setting.!! all the things that make you want too come back for more!!If you like this You'll love his work with Peter Straub- The Talisman-"
5,COULD BE MISTAKEN FOR THE BIBLE IN LATER GENERATIONS,"I had avoided Stephen King's ""Dark Tower"" series for a long time, and now feel quite dumb for having made the effort. I had worked under the false assumption that since Stephen King was best known for writing straight horror that was all that he could write, and ""The Dark Tower"" sure didn't sound like straight horror. As it turned out Stephen King is good at absolutely everything, including epic, cross-generational, large scale, near-religious, apocolyptic drama. ""The Dark Tower"" series is some of his very best work, filled with any variety of adventure and suspense, not to mention some of the fullest characters that he has ever writen. ""The Drawing of the Three"" is the standout of the series so far, not to suggest that the others are slouches. Get these books. You will not be disappointed, even if you typically dislike King."
1,Wein Customer Service is Unresponsive!,"I bought this item to use with my Nikon D200 and a ProFoto studio flash. It seemed like everything plugged in okay, but the flash synch is not reliable. It works perhaps 25%. I've sent Wein three e-mails about this, but all have been apparently ignored. Also, this item is not very durable, even if it did work reliably. It is definitely not up to professional standards."
2,SHORT ORDER,"Amazon has kindly flagged this up for me to pre-order, but I'm going to decline the invitation on the basis that fifteen 3-minute tracks falls well short of what I've come to expect from a reissue of out-of-copyright material."
1,A Certain Embrassment,"I found this video where I rent a few years ago. Without a doubt it ranks as one the most pathetic attemps at filmaking I've ever seen. The sound and visuals were abhorring, often I could'nt understand what the actors were saying. Done over the span of one year(So I've read)Madonna is mildly appealing in some scenes, but mostly sounds like Betty Boop on speed. In the lauded group sex scene she about as sexy as a Time Square hooker and as tired. Forget it... a waste of time and money."
3,madonna baby,"Madonna's acting in this movie is way better than most of her other pictures. If you don't believe me watch some of the movies she was in, they are all much worse.The Im-Materail Girl was paid $100.00 for her services in ""A Certain Sacrifice."" And even if she was paid that same salary for any of her other movies, $99.99 of it would still be too much (especially for ""Swept Away"" ""The Next Best Thing"" ""Bloodhounds of Broadway"" & ""Dangerous Game."")Maybe one day there will be a special edition box set with all her most wretched films? I'm sure all the mindless sheep in her flock will definitely run out and buy it the precise second it is released. At least it can't be said that Madonna ever lets her very much-beloved fans down."
2,madonna movie,Hard to sit through this one but interesting look at the earliest Madonna work. I actually got this because I knew the directors...
2,Madonna's not bad but...,"the sound quality is poor, it's overacted, it's dark and grainy (not to mention shaky - think Blair Witch Project) but if you are a Madonna fan, you might want to see it. (Story line a bit shaky as well.) I wouldn't say it's the worst movie ever made but it's certainly a contender. Though it is interesting to see New York in the late 70's (in a very different way than I remember it). Classicly poor student-type film. Not sure how/why this actually came out in DVD format. It's only an hour long so if you love Madonna, might be good for one viewing - only."
4,"Tight, blessed music!","I personally admire the music on this album. I think that the mixture of a jazz type style, in combination with the beautiful chords that the choir sings are enough to make you want to run around and shout! Praise God for his music ministers that honour and glorify HIM in his music. God is in Control!"
4,Fun to read,"I picked up this book because it looked like fun and because it takes place at a Ren Faire. The book was indeed fun to read, but I wasn't expecting all of the really intense sex scenes. I don't know if Walker and Pepper really loved each other or just each other's bodies. Are love and great sex the exact same thing?"
5,A delightful read,This is my second book of Katie MacAlister that I read and what a wonderful treat it was. A great evening that lasted until 3 in the morning *lol*.
3,Okay - not great,I love Ms. MacAlister's books but this one fell a little flat. Seemed to drag on and I didn't find the dialog as fun as her other books. The Corset Diaries was much better. Try that one for a better taste of her writing.
3,Could be 5 stars if....,"Katie McAllister is a very good writer. Her storys are well told and her characters are well defined. Now if she could just write a story without turning it into porn. Besides the main character being a nypho, all she can think about is sex. Have sex. And talk about sex. This seems to be a theme in the other books I've read by her. Doesn't Katie know, less is more. I don't need your detailed desciptions to get that they did it. Give me more story and less sex. Or give up the pretences of being a writer and just write for playgirl."
1,Quirky Romance at its best,This Book Hard Day's Knight is so good I couldnt put it down and I tell everyone I know to read her books every book she writes I read because she is that good. Read it read them all you wont be dissapointed.
5,WOW! Katie does it again!,I can always count on Katie MacAlister to provide a really good read! I could not put it down! I recommend this book to everyone.
2,MacAlister's Guide to Jousting?,"I wanted to like this - some of MacAlister's novels are among my favorites - I just couldn't get into it. In fact, I found myself just skimming whole pages because I got really, really tired of reading about the details of jousting. It felt like the main characters rarely interacted, and when they did, nothing happened that would inspire a magical love affair. If you're looking for details about the gear, clothing, and techniques of jousting, this is a good book for you. If you're looking for a good romance, look elsewhere."
2,If you want to learn more about jousting...,"I preferred Men in Kilts to this book. Learning the ins and outs of jousting was interesting, but it got a bit boring. There wasn't much else happening in this book. The characters were fairly two-dimensional and I never did figure out why Walker was attracted to Pepper. She just didn't seem his type. I guess she just overwhelmed him.This book isn't horrible, but it really isn't a must read either."
4,Another winner,"Great. If you have ever enjoyed the heat and dirt of a Renaissance Faire you will tune right in to this story. Again I am impressed with Ms. Macalister's ability to keep the main character a regular ""every girl"" not a stick figure who does everything perfectly and always looks great doing it. In fact Pepper may spend more time on her behind (not in a fun way) than any other heroin ever. This story is not particularly realistic but it is a lot of fun."
3,Not Her Best...,"After having the pleasure of reading 2 of Ms. MacAlister's previous books I have to say this was not one of her better offerings. I'll leave the story descriptions to other reviewers.Ms. MacAlister's typically witty character dialogue was not evident here and, while the story had potential, it just didn't have the sparkle and dynamics of 'The Corset Diaries' and 'Men in Kilts.' This does not sway me from her other offerings, though. Ms. MacAlister is just too fun to read."
3,it was okay.,"This was not the first book I had ever read by this author. She is an okay writer, but not a ""great"" writer. I don't know why I keep picking her books up expecting something better. The premise is good, but somehow falls flat in the writing. (as I side note: I didn't think that the main character's name, ""Pepper"", was a great choice for the female lead either)The characters are two-dimensional. The lines are cheesy. And it's repetitive instead of flowing. Yet I read it all the way to the end anyway. If you are looking for something light, go for it. Otherwise skip it."
2,Really not my style.,"This is the only Katie MacAlister book I've read, because a friend gave it to me, but I couldn't even finish it. I found the heroine grating and obnoxious and couldn't understand why ANYONE should fall in love with her. She puts her foot in her mouth repeatedly, is blunt to the point of illness, and seemed to be written as especially stupid and clueless as a means to advance the plot. I cringed through two-thirds of the book and then I gave up. The characters weren't worth caring about, but I gave it a good try. I'm sure Katie MacAlister isn't a best-selling novelist for nothing, but Hard Day's Knight was definitely not the right introduction."
5,Wonderfully written,"This book is one of the funniest modern romance tales from this author. She seamlessly marries modern day dilemmas within the realm of the ""Renaissance Faire"" type functions. The main character is delightfully onery andoffers some great one liners. The darned cat she is cat-sitting for also makes some scenes quite memorable!"
4,Not hard to read in one Knight ...er... Night!,"It was great fun getting to travel the Ren faire with Pepper in this novel. McAllister gives you a very intimate look at jousting and lets you watch Pepper live out her fantasy of a knight in shining armor come to the rescue! It's suitably iron that she thinks he is the one who need the rescuing. Papper can be a little airheaded and overanalytical at times, but that makes her familiar and likable.Typical of McAllister, theres always a mystery intertwined in the romance and once again, she keeps you guessing who it could be until the main character figures it out for herself. Even after the ""mystery"" is over, so to speak, she still leaves you wondering what will happen next. OH and of course there the non-cheesey, happy ending to the mad love affair at the end. ;)"
2,I'd rather have the jousting,"I'm not much into chick-lit, but I am into Renaissance Faires, which is why I picked up this book. A lot of reviewers didn't like the jousting, but I absolutely loved it. And I loved the Wench stuff, but there wasn't nearly enough of it mentioned, despite the main character's supposedly participating as a Wench for two weeks at the Faire. Outside of the jousting, really all we're left with is Pepper and Walker arguing, lusting after each other, then plenty of over-the-top sex. That got a little boring after a while, but the jousting scenes were quite exciting."
4,"Wenches and Jousting and Knights, Oh My!","I loved the whole Renaissance Faire setting and Pepper's character was hilarious. She's blunt and the dialog with her and Walker is great. Also, I loved Moth, the cat Pepper toted around with her all over the faire. Walker is a tortured soul kinda character, but doesn't go over the edge to where it's annoying. All the characters were great and the plot was fleshed out pretty well, I thought. I would've liked to see more about the other aspects of the Renaissance Faire aside from the jousting, but it was understandable that MacAlister didn't venture off too far with her writing into the other areas of the faire. At the end there were a few things I felt were left unresolved, but not as much as in MacAlister's ""The Corset Diaries."" If you like knight books or movies like First Knight or that one with Heath Ledger then more than likely you'll like this book."
4,Beats me why this hasn't become a movie,"The technology is dated, but the story is a terrific mix of science fiction, big government politics, religion and occult fantasy. Well worth reading."
3,"Is it an attempt to be like the hit, Watching words move?","Easy to go through, pleasant in certain areas, witty in other, funny a couple of times, and makes you think about a thing or two in our daily language that we just take for granted.You'll finish it within minutes. The pages design and layouts were done in such a way that I felt was very much inspired by the classic book 'watching words move' by Ivan Chermayeff and Tom Geismar.After you're done keep it on your coffee table, it will entertain your guests for sure, at least."
4,Havent gotten to shoot it yet...,So far this scope is all that I expected. It comes with two flip covers that work the eyepiece cover covers up the front focus but once you set it I don't think you need to change it a whole lot.This scope is calibrated for what looks like 12x for the mildot sight. I'll have to experiment with what the dots are at 16x to see if they are magnified or if they change their measurement.This scope was a great buy and it is incredibly clear with very fine sights.I'll post more after I shoot it a bit.
4,101 Games For Trainers,"While looking for a variety of training games I came across this book. What I like about this book is that it offers a variety of games for different situations. Whether looking for an opener or a team-building event, I can find an activity to go with a multitude of topics. It's often difficult to come up with enough activities to go with your presentation. I like this book because it had so many options for me to choose from without using the same one over and over again."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"You get what you pay for. I previously had a spout protector from another company. It lasted nearly 4 years and needed to be replaced. Thought since I have been pleased with the Sassy brand for many years that I'd try this cute frog out. What an error! The frog is too big for my bath spout and falls right off. The back of it is not at all designed for spouts of various sizes. It is definitely ""one size doesn't fit all"".Just a waste of money."
2,Not really useful,"We bought this to protect my daughter from hitting her head on the faucet in the bathtub. Unfortunately, this item is quite hard and so I'm not sure that it really would be that much less painful if she slips. It fits fine on our bath spout, but it also comes off very easily. Sometimes she takes it off and plays with it in the tub. I don't think it is worth the money. If I were going to look for something like this again I might try one of the inflatable ones, which would provide more padding for little heads."
2,"TOO BIG, TOO EXPENSIVE","Found this at a local store for half the price after buying online. I thought I had a large or standard tub spout/faucet, but this is too big for it. It seems like it may stay in place okay anyways though, but haven't used it yet."
3,Good but too big!,My son loves this but it is too big for a standard faucet. We stopped using it for that after about 2 baths cause it fell off anyway.
2,Whats the point?,"It covers the thing you pull to make the water go from spout to shower head.. so you have to take this off after every bath, I was hoping it could stay on because its hard to put on and off... I wont be using it"
2,Hard to Clean,"Bought this for $4 at Walmart. I did stay on our standard spout with a pull top and prevented bumps on the head, however, there were several drawbacks:1. Always had to remove it when using the shower.2. There are lots of curves and crevices inside from the shape of the frog, so this creates areas for water to collect and sit and thus mildew to grow on. It's pretty gross.We had to through it out and are now looking for something more simple and clean."
4,A great protector,"We purchased this spout guard specifically to prevent injury during exhuberant play in the bath tub. Our son likes to splash a lot and will stand up very quickly if he gets water in his eyes. This product has plenty of cushion to prevent him from hurting his head. The only downside is that it doesn't allow us to switch from tub spout to shower because the pull-up knob is covered by the frog's head. Otherwise, it's perfect for keeping our son from hurting his head."
3,"Effective Guard, but little else",This works well as a spout guard. But when running the faucet with this on causes the water to back up and could cause water to be pushed back into the tile area. We normally fill the tub before putting this on. It's fine to protect the spout from accidental bonks - but it's also very loose and can be pulled of easily.
3,"Cute, but renders faucet useless and does not fit","This little frog is cute, but useless. He sits on the faucet, barely... he more hangs off the faucet, but it gives my 13 month old something to look at. I cant use the water AT ALL if he is attached, which is ok for me though becuase he is in a blow up tub inside the real tub, and i have to use the detachable shower head to fill it anyways. When he becomes bigger for the tub by itself, i will buy a different froggy cover."
4,Cute and functional,"This is really cute and really useful to keep little heads from banging up against the tub spout. We love it! It did take a bit to fit on our spout as we don't have a standard spout, but we got it worked out."
3,Its alright.,"This froggie is so cute.. but doesn't do his job very well. On spouts with the shower pull, it wont fit at all. On spouts without one, it fits, but moves around. If you want a steady waterflow, you have to hold it while running a bath. I'm not that picky, but this one kida bugged me. It is now being used as a bath toy."
3,Froggie Spout Guard,I would give this product a higher rating if it fit our faucet. The plastic hard so it should protect but we are unable to use it. A description of the faucet size required would be helpful. Our faucet is from the 70's so maybe that's the problem.
2,Not a good fit for us,"Doesn't stay on the spout, my kids (both 14months at this time) both like to hit it, and it takes only a slight bump for it to come off. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it may not protect the spout but it is an interesting bath toy, that's just not why we bought it."
1,Way Too Hard,"This is supposed to be a safety feature for children while in the tub. If they happened to hit their head on it they would probably need stitches or medical attention. A faucet protector needs to be soft and full of foam. I bought one years ago for my kids, now can't find one for my grandkids.I loved Amazon.com and their fast service."
2,Very hard plastic so I returned it,We ordered this spout guard as our 11 month old is now taking baths in the bath tub without her infant bath seat. As she moves around we are concerned she might bang her head on the faucet. However this sassy froggie is almost as hard as the faucet. It probably will be safer because there are no sharp edges but we were looking for something much softer. Maybe it was just wrong expectations on our part but we returned this item and will continue to search for something soft. A bang against this will certainly hurt.
1,Terrible. Very hard plastic.,"No spot for the lever that you pull up for the shower. This frog is cute, but extremely hard. You child might as well bump his head on the metal faucet. Don't buy."
2,cute but doesn't fit,Cute product but it falls off easy and that was the first thing my son went for when he was in the tub. Needs to have some sort of fastener or something.
2,Did not fit,"This hard plastic frog did not fit my standard tub spout. I even tried to cut it to fit, but that did not work. I thought it was cute, and so did my son, but it slid right off when I tried to put it on."
1,Doesn't Fit,"I'm not going to waste much time on this review. The bottom line is this spout cover does not fit our standard size bathtub spout so it's completely useless to me. I see that this is a common problem. If you find you are having the same issue, I recommend that you try the Puj spout cover."
2,Doesn't fit our tub spout!,"Product is sturdy but it doesn't fit our tub spout (which, by the way, is completely standard sized.) It goes on, but the water doesn't come out at the right spot and it ends up falling off with no effort. Our 10 month old can pull it right off of the spout, so it doesn't do much to protect her from bonking her head!"
2,Hard to follow,The British accents used in the film made it difficult to follow. The poor transmission made it impossible to watch.
4,Modern but true to the genre,For fans of the original books this series is a great update that keeps the faith with the original characters.
3,More difficult than I thought,"I bought this based on the reviews. I thought this would be a good DVD for someone who hasn't done a lot of Yoga, but knows some basics, I was wrong. There is no warm up at all, you go straight into the yoga. I found that the first few positions were kind of hard to start with, the positions would be better later in the video when you have a chance to warm up to them. I am not on a regular exercise routine and was hoping to get on one with this video, but found that I was overwhelmed within the first few minutes of this video and was unable to continue. I think this DVD is best for someone who already does yoga/ exercise on a regular basis.I got no pregnancy relief from this DVD. I gave it three stars because I can see the potential in this video for someone who is a little more advanced than I with Yoga."
2,Not for beginners!,"This DVD was a disappointment. I'm not nearly as flexible as the woman in the DVD, especially pregnant, and I am a beginner to yoga. The only modification they offered was to sit on a rolled towel. I was unable to do most of the positions and had to do my own version of them instead. There was also a lot of mumbo jumbo about ""feeling the spirit of the earth"" etc. and I found myself rolling my eyes throughout the whole exercise session. I would NOT recommend this DVD, especially for someone new to yoga."
4,Prenatal Yoga Review,"I have been doing the prenatal yoga portion of this DVD through my 2nd and 3rd trimesters. I believe I'll be able to use it all the way to the end, as I find it has a good balance of relaxation and challenge and nothing inappropriate for late pregnancy. I really enjoy the standing series of poses. And I'm always happy when there's pigeon pose. The voice over doesn't bother me, as other yoga DVDs have this as well. The one thing I find backward in the DVD is the breathing for cat/cow or similar transitions (usually you'd exhale while rounding your back) - but it doesn't ruin the yoga at all.. Overall I'd recommend this DVD for the Prenatal section. I'm looking forward to doing the Postnatal section as well.Other prenatal DVD's I'd recommend: Jennifer Wolfe's Prenatal Vinyasa Yoga - definitely more challenging and I had to give it up beyond 35 weeks due to heartburn (lots of downward dog); Desi Bartlett's Prenatal Yoga - very relaxing, but also has a good standing series of poses."
4,I liked it,"It a gentle, calming excecise and I enjoyed doing it every morning. It helped circulation of blood once in the morning and the moves were easy to follow and effective enough to warm me up for the day."
4,Gentle,"The yoga session for prenatal women is 30 minutes and pretty gentle and not too challenging. It's a good stretch, though, and it helps me connect to my growing baby and my changing body."
5,Saved me!,"This DVD saved me. The post natal practice is amazing, I do it every morning. It has made such a difference in my life. I have never done yoga before and needed an exercise at home after giving birth, this is perfect. It is a joy to complete every morning."
5,Great Yoga Program,"This is a great program. It is about 30 minutes long making it easy to fit into my schedule.The moves are not too easy or too hard at this point for me (14 weeks). She does have modifications as one gets further along.I really like that she voices over the yoga workout so her voice stays constant and soothing.Also, there is nothing cheesy about this workout making it easy to get through."
4,Useful,"The DVD comes in two parts: pre and post partum. I only used the prenatal part, starting from when I was 5 months pregnant. It helped a lot with back and neck pain by doing it two or three times a week. I'm new to yoga and I wish some positions were explained a little more but in general it is easy to follow even for beginners. I'd recommend it."
3,It's ok,Never done yoga and wow some poses are hard not being pregnant. But it had some good exercise for women.
3,good for all 3 trimesters,"I'm a novice to Yoga, but I found this video serene and helpful with breathing. It's a video you can do for all 3 trimesters and it even has a postnatal yoga session. Some of the moves were for more flexible people than I am but it's easy to modify the position. None of the moves involve lying down."
5,Fantastic workout!!!!,"I bought this DVD among 5 others (a mix of prenatal and postnatal yoga and pilates DVDs) and this one is fantastic. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who is pregnant or has just had a baby. The workout is both calming and challenging. With each pose I felt relaxed but at the same time could really feel it working. The aim is to create space in your body particularly around your abdomen, to relax and to build strength- all important for your changing body. I feel energised yet relaxed at the same time as I only just finished my workout and can't wait to do another session tomorrow."
3,A little challenging for new yoga moms,"So I read a review that said that this video was simple yoga stretches. I was excited because I'm not an expert. The stretches aren't extremely hard but I found it to be challenging and also a bit boring. The lady on the video is very ""new age"" and it did not keep my attention. It's okay but not my favorite."
5,My favorite pregnancy and postnatal workout,"I love this workout! I was extremely sick during my pregnancy and wasn't able to exercise at all until about 25 weeks. I started this workout, along with daily walks, and stayed in great shape for the second half of my pregnancy. My favorite part of this DVD though is the postnatal yoga. This workout really helped me heal and feel like myself again. Definitely recommend this!"
5,Enjoyable,"I really like this yoga video because it is pretty short, so I don't have to block out an hour of my day. In about 20 min I feeling good. It is relaxing and has nice music playing in the background."
5,Complete relaxation,I am so glad I am trying prenatal yoga!! This has made a huge difference so far in my pregnancy. It is so relaxing:)
3,Not recommended for third trimester,"I have purchased other pregnancy yoga dvds that modify for each trimester. I tried this dvd at 7 months pregnant and it was too much for me. I didn't find that this yoga routine was any different from a non-pregnancy yoga routine. This yoga dvd may be ok for the first trimester and part of the second, but I strongly advise being careful when using this dvd for the latter part of pregnancy."
4,Solid Prenatal Yoga,"Review for Prenatal workout only:I borrowed this DVD from a neighbor after complaining about a yoga DVD that seemed to gentle (Jane Austin Prenatal Yoga DVD- which I am holding onto because I think I may want it during my 3rd trimester). I am in my 2nd trimester and this yoga DVD is pretty good! I agree with some of the other reviews that I would like to hold some of the poses for longer, but I appreciate that this is about half an hour and that it gets my heart rate moving a little bit (not too much). On a day when I don't feel like doing a full workout, this is a great alternative to still get in some good stretching.I'm going to try a few other yoga DVDs and will update once I can get more of a comparison. So far, this is a pretty good option and a good value for the price here on Amazon. My neighbor said she did the postnatal workout a lot with her last pregnancy and really liked it."
4,"great workout, wish it were longer","I am 5 months pregnant & hadn't been working out much at all when I ordered this video, so i was looking for something low impact but effective, which this video is. The prenatal portion is fairly simple but I still felt like I had moved around & got my blood pumping. Lots of good stretches & deep breathing, & the instructor is very descriptive & offers modifications if needed.The only drawback is that the yoga session seems short to me. Maybe 20mins? I'm not entirely sure, but I was expecting something longer maybe 45-60mins. That doesn't mean it's not worth doing though. I still recommend it!"
4,Felt great!,"This was a refreshing and gentle exercise for me. I was doing moderate yoga pre-pregnancy, but then the first trimester wore me out and I was unable to do any exercise at all. This was a good way to get back into the exercise regiment once my energy returned. I felt wonderful and energized all day after doing it.My only negative would be the new-age-y overtones. I understand that makes it more authentic yoga, but I'm not into that sort of thought lifestyle.Overall, however, I would highly recommend this."
4,"Quick, simple stretching workout","This is a good, simple yoga workout. It gets to feel pretty easy after you do it a few times, but I like having it to alternate with a longer, more challenging workout."
3,Element: Prenatal & Postnatal Yoga,"I am in my 3rd trimester. I tried the prenatal yoga in this video, and my muscle was sored for the next 2 days. I don't really like this workout (maybe this workout is good for 1st or early 2nd trimester). I ended up doing the prenatal yoga by Ann Richmond all the time, which I felt so much better physically."
2,Not for beginners,"If you have never done yoga before, this video is not for you. It would be difficult to do many of the moves while pregnant if you are not experienced. Particularly the downward facing dog and plank pose. This video does not offer many alternatives for a ""beginner"" or ""light"" option like most work out videos do. I tried this video 6 weeks post-pregnancy and had difficulty doing it. I am not out of shape! I am glad I checked this out at the library first."
2,Difficult poses for pregnancy,"I ordered this for my 2nd pregnancy. In first trimester I tried to follow the poses and found them quite difficult to do. I could still do it, but didn't feel comfortable about continuing practicing this. It is only for 30 mins. I haven't seen the postnatal part yet.So don't know about it. May be it will help me then.Earlier I did follow another prenatal yoga demonstrated by Shiva Rae and it was quite useful. Poses were given with 3 different options for each trimester. I person can choose a difficulty level that she is comfortable with. Every person is different and every time our body condition changes esp. during pregnancy. I found what I did earlier was way better than this yoga cd.--The Wife."
4,dvd,"I really enjoyed this yoga dvd, it goes a little quick for the first time but once i learned the routine and poses i was able to enjoy it more because it flows pretty well. i am looking forward to the postnatal part after i deliver :)"
5,Perfect time,"Started this in third trimester. I love that it goes quickly, is about 1/2 hour for the prenatal portion and that's about all i can handle right now! It makes me feel really relaxed and also works out my aches and pains. I have been increasingly uncomfortable as I am now in 34th week and this helps me sleep. Highly recommended."
5,I'm a Fan,"I had a ROUGH first trimester and didn't work out a single time. Once over the nausea, etc, I got back into working out with this DVD. It's energizing and relaxing and makes you feel like you did something without any over exertion or unnecessary fatigue. If you're looking for an advanced Yoga workout, this may not be it, but you'll feel good doing it!!"
1,Perhaps historically significant but otherwise useless,"In purchasing this book, I was assuming that the ""Manage"" portion of the title was basic care, but this book says essentially nothing on that topic. The description given by Amazon really never indicated its content, and there were no reviews to study at the time that I purchased this book. We are only told that it was a ""facimile reprint and may contain imperfections"". I would have loved to have known its basic content. It says little on ""How to Breed"" (as indicated in title) -- being concerned only with blood lines and ""what to breed"". This book was apparently written in 1900 for people who were very familiar with the basic care of fantail pigeons. I really cannot imagine that anyone would have need for this book. However, if you already raise fantail pigeons and would like a 110+ year old historical monograph (reprinted in 2009) on blood lines and exhibition, this book is certainly for you."
3,Do some homework and be SURE it's compatible!,"I know it's a pain in the neck to contact manufacturers and even worse to try and find one of their people who can answer your questions, but in this case it is CRITICAL. This handy gadget can reduce the sync voltage on your old flash unit to a level compatible with your digital camera. Doing this can save hundreds of dollars when you don't have to buy a new flash unit. However, do the homework and make sure that it provides sufficient voltage reduction for YOUR particular digital camera. I completely fried the hot shoe on a $400 Olympus Camedia by just assuming that it would work."
5,Better Safe then sorry,"To start, my camera didn't have a pc sync port. Plus, I lucked into a ton of old flashes. Even though I looked them up, found they were less than the 250v my Nikon D40 could handle, wasn't going to risk killing my camera. Well, the Safe Sync took care of both having a pc sync socket AND removed any worry about using these powerful old and inexpensive flashes! Now I can use a flash on, or on a bracket, connected to a pc sync cable... and with a couple cheap optical triggers, can trigger those others without using my on-camera flash. My advice if you are considering using any older flashes, buy this FIRST!"
5,Mr.,Excellent product. works with my Canon 7D and Olympus Ep-1 without having to worry about flash's high voltage that could damage low voltage electronic circuit on DSLR. I only had this product for a week now and have only praise for it. Recommended.
4,Solid,"I bought this to try out off-camera lighting on my old Digital Rebel. That camera does not come with a built-in PC sync socket. This device serves as a conversion between the hot shoe, for attaching flashes to the top of the camera, and an off-camera flash sync cord. More than that it provides voltage protection. I found that I was able to use a 70's era Vivitar 283 safely, on or off camera by putting the Safe-Sync between them.Even if you only plan to use a flash on the camera, this can save you big bucks and offer peace of mind. With this assurance that an older flash is safe to use with your camera you are free to buy powerful manual flashes that cost a tenth or less of what Canon & Nikon charge for their current top models."
4,It salvaged my 30-year-old flash,"With this gadget, I am able to use my Vivitar 283 flash unit with my new digital Canon and Panasonic cameras. I have several accessories for the 283, too, so it was worthwhile to pay the price of the adapter to have the use of the still-serviceable Vivitar flash system. I agree with another reviewer's comments about lack of technical information on the device."
1,Not for all flashes,"I have been using this device for a couple of years. It works well with several flash units, including an old Vivitar 285. I was surprised today when it failed to trigger an older Bowens studio flash. The Bowens' trigger voltage is 12 volts, the same as many of my other flashes that still work properly. The Bowens unit was checked out and it works with other camera's with a built in PC connection. The Wein device will not fire the Bowens from the camera or it own test button. When I called Wein, I was informed that the owner and only engineer was out and will only reply to email and then only if he feels like it. They did offer to take the unit back for service but it is not broken, just not well designed."
2,Review of Wein Safe-Sync,Wein Products W990560 (SSHSHS)It does not work with my Nikon D5100. The camera will not flash. Can I return it?
1,Make sure to confirm compatability with your camera,"I'd like to give this product a better rating but I can't. It's not that I don't want to but I wasn't able to use it. When I received it I found that not only would it not fit onto my Sony A700 camera, but it would not accept my old Minolta flash units. I was hoping to save some money and use my old flash but looks like I'm going to have to buy a new flash unit for my new Sony camera. So before you buy this item be sure to confirm that it will work with the camera and flash you are planning to use it with."
3,vary good view put painful mask,"i got a copy of this mask and start to use it for diving.the view is perfect and it fits my face well.the only problem with it is the purge valve which make the equilazation very difficult and a painful task, because when you try to close your nose with your finger the valve will pressure your nose. and over one hour of diving in many depth levels you will end up with big pain.two of my friend got the same problem.i got a new mask for me scubapro spectra 2 and it is perfect."
4,CRYAL CLEAR DESCRIBES THIS MASK,The mask fits snug on the face you do not have to overtighten to keep a good fit. Dove in the Grand Caymen and the view was spectacular and unobstructed by water in the mask or fogging but I did use anti fog. Great comfortable mask
3,Nice but not indestructible,Pro: silicone makes good fit; side windows provide nice peripheral vision; purge valve drains water gradually but automatically; you get a better view looking through one big piece of glass rather than two lenses.Con: the clear plastic frame around the glass cracked on my mask; the black plastic head strap bracket on the side cracked and broke off on my wife's mask; the rubber strap is uncomfortable but you'll probably replace that anyway. I'm rough and somewhat careless with my stuff. Some of it has lasted for years but not this.
2,Dissapointed,"Unfortunatly this mask prooved to be a dissapointment. I expected more from ""Scuba Pro"". For the money I spent, Scuba Pro is laughing to the bank. This mask is likened to our food proportions these days. Less for more! This is a small mask and very shallow. If you're face is slighly larger than an average twelve year old don't bother. Nothing like you're noze being pressed against the plastic lens and to boot, this mask is guaranteed to fog no matter the arsenal of tricks you have in you're dive bag... I could and should of done just as well at our local WalMart for one third the money, same day service and not to mention product quality."
1,Don`t understand DDRE !!!!!,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and I thought I bought a game for Playstation. Is this a game or a audio CD. I can only get it play as a cd. I can`t intigrate it with the dancepad that I bought for her. Can anyone help me?
2,For J. who was frustrated,"I noticed someone said this doesnt work with the dancepad. That is because this is the music cd for DDR, not the game. Thats why you're having trouble ^^;;"
1,Not a worthy product,"I wore these into a store while I shopped and after about twenty or thirty minutes, they were both rolled down below my knees. Not worth the effort. I weigh 250 lbs. I am not a small person. I ordered medium based on the chart. I sent them back the next day."
2,Didn't do what I expected for some support and didn't stay up when walking.,Needed more support to my knees and it slippped down or curled underneath clothing.Not pleased with this product at all.
5,True to the historical details,"I think that Cassie Edwards wrote a great book. I love how she wrote the great details and how informative she was with this book. The main characters are endearing and my favorite character was the actual, Chief Washakie. Look up the history of that truly peace-loving, endearing cheif. Cassie kept true to his character. A little grousome in some of the detail, but life was lived differently then, a plus in the describtion of the main character's brother. Great book and worth the reading."
2,not for everyone,I was disappointed with this book. It is not a theme everyone can relate to. You have to be obssessed with horses to be able to enjoy this book. It takes great courage to embark on a journey like the authors did but not everyone will be able to appreciate this book.
2,Why bother?,"This game is an overal dumb idea, The model ship on the cover of this game is an illistration, and not something you can actually make. You can't customize anything, for example, there is one pool, and you can have one sized ship. I trully beleive that who ever made this game could have done better."
1,First time I returned a game!,"What a disappointment! I own tons of sim and adventure type games from when I started gaming 10 years ago and I must say, this is the first one I ever took back to the store. Can you say, L-A-M-E? Among other complaints with the game, there is a constant demand for more restaurants, entertainment, shops, etc, which was ridiculous because there wasn't enough room on the ship to place these items. Because you aren't 'filling the need' your reputation goes down constantly. It just plain old wasn't fun! This is just my short opinion given in hopes of saving someone else the the same misadventure that I experienced. HTH!"
1,Does Not Work,"When I try to build a room on the ship, it crashes my Windows 2000 Computer. Looked at their site for maybe some updates or FAQs, but there are none. This is being returned."
2,Needs some work,"This is a really good idea for a simulation game, but there are so many things that could be so much ebtter about it. It's very limited in the types of objects you can purchase and it would be better if you could choose your route. Anyway, it's a pretty easy game so it would be good for kids, but it doesn't take long to master it (like three hours or less.)"
3,Good Game!,Carnival Cruise Tycoon is much better than the original Cruise Tycoon. This game you start out owning a small ferry and then you work your way up. After a while this game can get very boring. They need more building options. Overall it's an alright game.
2,Way too simple...,"This game is great fun for about three hours, until you realize that you have purchased every item available, bought every ship, and no longer have anything else to do except repeat the game. It seems more like a advertisement for carnival ships quickly thrown together into a video game. Don't get me wrong its fun for a little while, but just is way too simple and doesn't hold your attention once you've done everthing. Its the sort of game you play once then sell or put away for a year till you are interested in playing again."
1,Ugh,"Let me sum up this game in one sentence: this game is horrible. What a rip off. Don't believe anything on the product descrpition. ""Carnival Cruise Tycoon is so close to the real thing--you'll think you are actually on-board,"" What a lie!! First of all, when you start sailing, you only fill in a few decks. The rest are all empty! It gets really annoying when the waiters at the resturants get stuck between tables and can't serve anyone. It's so hard to describe how bad this game is. It's just a badly made game. Please don't buy. It's for your own good. A waste of money."
3,Good Game,"This game is fun, dont expect a highly detailed take months to figure out game, it is challenging at times but all in all it is pretty easy. But for the money it is good fun. I recommend it!!!!"
4,"Seksu Roba, Dim Dim, Flaspar!","This album is pretty good. I especially like the more lesser known artists' remixes. Seksu Roba's remix is really good and psychedelic,Dim Dim's remix is good, and Flaspar's remix is pretty good as well."
2,Amateur researcher produces amateur book,"As a native of the area the author investigated, and someone who believes the thesis she puts forward is possible, I found this book very disappointing. She had an opportunity to examine a unique situation but spent so much time in relating step by step research of the place name, she exposed the sloppy nature of her efforts and instead of establishing credibility proved she was over her head in this project which was self published. Had she solicted expert help and local historians she would had put forth a much more readable and exciting story. The content is worth reading but the book is tedious and frustrating."
5,"""Shakespeare in Love"" for readers.","I can't believe I'm the first reader to submit a review of this book. How is it possible that this novel hasn't been discovered by a legion of admirers -- especially in the wake of ""Shakespeare in Love""? This is one of the most enjoyable reads I've had in a long while. Anyone with a passing interest in Shakespeare will find much to appreciate in this novel. And the more familiar you are with the Bard, the more you will glean from it. A fascinating mix of fact, speculation, and outright fabrication, ""The Late Mr. Shakespeare"" is a riotously bawdy romp which occasionally spins on a dime to become touching, contemplative, and wise. Wonderfully written."
3,"quality fair, but the songs are awesome!","Brethren was a band that came and went fairly quickly in the rock and roll scheme of things. I saw them a multitude of times at the Capitol Theatre in Port Chester, NY, where they opened up for many headliners. I was obssessed with them from the moment I heard them. I purchased their only two lp's and wore out the first lp twice. I've been looking for the cd for years and was happy to see that someone put it out. The quality is fair however, as the remastering could have used some more care. However, their songs are truly great and they grow on you with every listen. It was awesome to have their material on a cd, so I wouldn't wear out the only lp I have left of them. I highly recommend the cd purely on the strength of the songs. This band should have been a much bigger deal. It's a shame that so many talented bands fall under the radar, but they can't all be famous."
4,Beautiful watch,"Nice-looking watch. Looks good with my work clothes and jeans as well. Keeps good time. The band is a little stiff, though."
4,Easy to set up easy to use,"this product does exactly what it says it will do. it is simple to set up, simplet to program for each user, and gives easily trackable recordable information. i would recommend it as a good value for the money."
5,Tanita review,"I liked the product, very user friendly and accurate, the only thing is that it doesnt have a setting that some monitors have, for three levels of your typical activity, sedentary, moderate, very active, which makes a difference on the fat reading. While the fat reading might not be entirely accurate, I had 3 friends who were of different visibly fat levels, fat, average, very fit and the machine showed corresponding fat levels, so the bottom line is when you do go down in fat, the machine's fat reading goes down too, which is important."
3,"The Scale is great the Body Fat %, no so much.","I've been using this scale for 4 years. I bought it to track my weight and body fat %. In the last year I've lost and gained back 10 lbs twice and now I'm down 14 lbs and counting. In that time my body fat percentage has been a high of 25.4 and a low of 21.7. The high's and lows do not follow weight loss. 10 weeks ago I weighed 182 lbs and my body fat was at 22.7% after loosing 14 lbs and not working out at all (no new muscle mass) it say's I'm at 23.3%. FYI: I weigh myself at the same day/time every time and hydration is always 52 +/-1Having said that, it appears that measuring body fat via Bioelectrical impedance analysis is not very accurate. This article gave it a C+, better than calipers or BMI scale. But worse than everything else. I'm going to go find a Body Pod and get a accurate measurement. [...]"
1,not what I expected...,subliminal messages?...maybe but hardly to the extent the author wants you to believe...childish bogieman bull..could not even finish first chapter. I will read reviews in future..felt cheated
5,Broaden Your Vision !,"This is an awesome book which takes the principles which made the biblical Solomon the Richest Man Who Ever Lived and turns them into a practical guide to find God's will for yourself and reach massive success in life today. At the same time, the book is an excellent guide for reaching the same degree of success, even if you are already ""where you've been assigned."" Everyone owes it to him/herself to read this book !"
3,HUBBY VERY UNHAPPY............,"did not know he couldn't use this heater in his garage cuz of the plug in. he was exited until he seen the plugin. can't say the heater was faulty, or it was the companys fault...I take the blame. but I can say that they deliverd it in the time they said they would, and they even took the item back even though it was my fault. very good company to deal with, very kind, considerate and understanding.MsStretch"
3,Far from Roller Coaster and Zoo tycoon,"Short and simply put.. If you have been a Roller Coaster and Zoo Tycoon player - I feel you will be really disappointed in Shrine Circus Tycoon.. One thing is you cannot back off far enough to see where your placing things.. Thus, the Circus can become quite a mess of a lay out with zoo goings constantly feeling lost. And there is no place to go to help them from feeling lost.. There is just far to much to list in regards to what I don't like about this game.. Maybe the younger folks will have a better time with it - but I doubt that.. For us old time Tycoon players - no thanks.. Very disappointed.Althought it is a little Better than Zoo Empire (big thumbs down).."
3,Circus Tycoon,"This game is sort of fun. I haven't figured out how to have a cool circus and keep everyone happy in the game. It got here in time and runs well so the seller did what was promised, not really worth it to buy."
5,Edgar Winter,Love his music! Added to collection. Love the song from My cousin Vinny. It is one of our favorites. Thanks!
3,Confusing and badly worded,"Whilst the author seems to write as best he can from a non-duel perspective, the words he uses are confusing and often sound contradictory! My advise, if the non-dual perspective appeals to you, save your money and buy either Loe Hartongs book, Awakening to the Dream, any of Tony Parsons works, or Nathan Gill's new book Already awake. All are strictly non-dual and are much clearer, in my opinion, than this text."
3,Underlying Assumption,"Jan's book on consciousness, like Tony Parson's and Eckhart Tolle's, takes a leap of faith in assuming consciousness is located in your brain or head. Many cultures, when asked where there consiousness is located, would point to their heart. Maybe Jan never found himself and therefore concluded that he is a No Body, because he only searched in his head. (Declaring that you are a phantom or nobody is declaring that your are something). Also, Jan's beliefs (even though he denies having beliefs) refuse to accept personal responsbility for thoughts and actions. His case is because consciousness is living through him, he has no choice over his actions or power over his immediate surroundings. The book is a fascinating read however, but the reader must exerscize discernment and think for thereself. And for a book about non dualism, Jan is pretty black and white."
1,No substance in this book,The author's words are very confusing. And often contradictory. A book full of opposites.Comes across as no substance. Jan is a teaser.
2,Digital Camera Conversion Lens/Tube Adapter for Nikon Coolpix 5700 8700,Digital Camera Conversion Lens/Tube Adapter for Nikon Coolpix 5700 8700The wrong product was shipped from the supplier and had to be exchanged for additional cost.
2,Useless,"I have to agree with the other thumbs-down reviewer. Inflating this pillow is an exercise in frustration. I certainly would not want to do it on a plane with an audience. The valve doesn't have a cover, instead you're supposed to ""push it in"" and it closes underneath (this is hard to describe, sorry). The valve likes to slide into the closed position while one tries to blow into the pillow.On the bright side, the material covering the air chamber is very soft and likely quite comfortable.Maybe it gets easier to inflate with practice, but I'll keep looking. I've flown 40,000 miles so far in 2007, but like the other reviewer, I didn't take this with me last time I flew. It stayed on my dining room table."
2,Difficulty,"We found that the inflation tube is to short and very difficult to blow up. In addition even while blowing up the pillow,the tube goes to the close position by it self and complete inflation becomes a problem.Needless to say we have not used it on our last airline trip,and not satisfied"
5,Best bead book,"I am a bead dealer, and I have about 15 books on beads. This is, hands down, the one I use most. When I look for information on a bead, I am more likely to find it in this book than anywhere else. If you get only one book on beads, make it this one."
4,very informative in a consice format,"A fine book to get into the basics of bead identifacation, collecting, history and methods of manufacture. Oloff, the bead hoarder says: ""Ouf Da! I'm glad all those antique dealers have not found this great little guide!"" Price lists are allways interesting and never reliable, this is the case with this book. Very worthwile, lot of great info and pics, lots cheaper than those BIG books."
1,I DON'T KNOW BEADS,AND THIS BOOK DIDN'T HELP ME UNDERSTAND THEM ANY BETTER. IT JUST CONFUSED ME MORE
5,Get kids to clean up their room,"We used this book for storytime at our children's center to teach, in a fun way,that kids should clean their rooms. We also have a copy of it in Spanish and did a side by side bilingual reading. The 3-5 year olds thought it was funny."
1,"""Goofy and Anticy""","I only bought it because I was auditioning for the play at my school. When I watched it I would mute out every time Carol Channing spoke. Particularly ""Jazz Baby."" The only thing that did not have me turning it off and calling it a bad day was Julie Andrews lovely voice (and the fact that I had spent twenty dollars.) If you like it no offense meant! We all like different things, but to those that do not like ""goofy, anticy movies"" I wouldn't recommend it.:)"
2,The NEON is REALLY neon,"The color in real life is SUPER neon pink. Not like the picture at all, at least on my computer. And their return policy is a bit strict, 15% re-stocking fee, no shipping charges refunded, and no intimate apparel or costume returns AT ALL. But, it is a nice stretchy comfy skirt. But waaaay too pink."
2,to revealing,This skirt will be used for a bikini cover or thrown into the lingerie drawer. disappointed in this order. I'm glad i didn't spend much on it.
4,Depressing yet inspiring,"Read it for French class, but read the english version instead. Interesting plot. Short enough story to keep readers interested. I tried reading the french version, but it was too difficult."
2,le silence de la rubbish book,"i too am studying this school at french so basically what would i know. as well as not being very good at french im also not much of a book reader. in my opinion the only good part of the book is when it prevails that werner is sending himself to the frontline, he would rather die than destroy france and its people. thats quite touching. i wouldnt recommend reading this book for pleasure. thats strange i can smell gravy..."
3,A little disappointed...,"We are huge Steeler's fans, so I couldn't wait to get this for my son for Christmas. The game board is awesome, filled with Steeler's references. However, the property cards are the generic old monopoly cards. It's quite irritating to try to match up a property to one that has a different name, as one of the three properties is slightly more money, more rent, etc. We wound up writing the original property on the board itself. I would say this wasn't worth it. Just an ""eh."""
1,Bad game!!!,"i cant believe i paid for this, most of the mods at planetquake.com are better than this peice of junk!first of all there are no new sound for the enemy models (sounds kinda wierd when a mutant is chasing you, and it sounds like a strogg guard).the models are of POOR quality (hey im a noob at modeling but i create better models than that).the game crashes with all known versions of quake 2 on the FIRST level.the textures are CHEAP the game was made AFTER half-life you think that a game made after 1998 would look better (and hl uses the quake1 engine!!!).there are NO new weapon models, but the new weapons are cheaply made!And last but not least DONT BUY IT!!! spen your money on a mod that is woth the money."
4,"Problems as received, quickly resolved by seller","Received printer, set up the unit, installed HP toner cartridge and printer drivers. All features worked with the exception of the #3 paper tray paper pick-up assembl,y when loaded with 11"" X 17"" paper. Every attempt to print 11 x 17 copies resulted in a ""Paper Jam"" message and the unit would shut down. I e-mailed PFC (seller) regarding the problem and they forwarded the e-mail to their tech support. The tech called with-in the hour and after running a number of tests the diagnosis was a failure of the paper pick-up assembly in the #3 paper tray unit.PFC sent a replacement tray unit and upon installation, the issue was resolved.I would recommend this seller; I was impressed with their methods and timely response of resolving warranty issues with their products."
3,Smooth but Thin,"Well-programmed percussion melded w/ funky Clinton-esque(not Bill) vox. Grows on you like the ivy lining my ATL Rec Studio. Needs depth and more direction, but surely, with time this could well be a rising star!"
5,Amazing,"I saw this band in a small pub in Fairfax, Virginia. They were absolutely incredible. Four of my friends and I all bought the CD right on the spot. I cannot wait to see them again."
2,Divorce Handbook: Published 1984.,"I was disappointed when I found that the latest publication date fot the Divorce Handbook was 1984. Imagine Amazon touting a 27-year-old book! Thank God I only lost about six bucks.Material very, very basic.The delivery was timely and item received in good order."
3,"Functional, but not flattering on me.","I'm a size 10 and it fits when I fully expand it. I wouldn't recomend it for anyone that wears a size larger than this. Another thing is that since I have it fully expanded, the back straps are situatied so that they are more to the side than the back and unfortunately these can't be moved. The straps are lacy, which I think adds a cute factor. I bought it for my wedding day and I will use it, but I think I would have purchased something else if I had been able to try it on before I bought it. If you are smaller than I am, then I think you will like this product."
2,All set to love it...,...when one of the garters fell off.POP!So much for that. It didn't even last one day of Dress-up!Save a little more and buy a good set.
4,Kinder Guide,"My daughter just started kindergarten and I discovered that the instructors are using this book as a guide. She's attending an Accelerated Charter Prep, she's learning at a level above her grade. The Charter helps the children prepare for college. Although this book is at the level of Kindergarten it has been used as an assessment tool. I would encourage anyone with pre-school age children to get this book and start prep-ing. It covers topics such as pronouns, sentence types, sensory detail, statements and questions, location words (behind, inside,first...) and so much more. Seems like Amazon has a few used versions for a little over 5 bucks, not bad. Mommies and Daddies who want to get a HeadStart on HeadStart don't hesitate to get your scholar Language Art Skills..."
4,Pushing Musical Limits,"I have been playing music for the last 14 years in one form or another. I started out as a rock guitarist and am now producing experimental electronica. I bought this book about seven years ago, started reading it, then had to put it down. This book is NOT for beginners.Along with ""The Advancing Guitarist"" by Mick Goodrick, this book is intended to push your musical boundaries. The emphasis is on orchestrated music, but I have found application in all the music I do and love. Sherman approaches music theory in an exciting, creative, and stimulating manner.If you feel that your art is stagnating, buy this book. It will make you explore facets of music you never considered seeking out, and I guarantee a fascinating journey."
5,R & B rhythm styles,"I highly recommend any DVD presented by Richard Smith. I have them all, and he covers techniques that you're not likely to see in any other presentation. This DVD focuses on R & B playing, which didn't interest me at first- I thought I was getting a lesson on different strumming styles. Instead, Smith lasers in on all sorts of techniques that you wouldn't expect: one being ""bubble"" picking. Another technique he calls ""funnies."" Really, you have to see this guy in action to understand his complete mastery of modern electric guitar playing. Buy just one of them. You'll probably get 'em all, just like I did."
4,Great tire!,"I've had this tire on my bike for about 4-5 months and it still has great tread, I ride in the woods and also romp on the gas in the streets so surprisingly it hasn't worn down from the pavement. Other than that great traction no acedental slips. Great buy"
2,Light on.,"I agree with the first reviewer, Andy, this book looks nicebut for information on home cheese making you can't go pastRicki Carroll's book."
1,Little Content,The book is like one of those $5 cookbooks with lots of pictures and little content. If you'd like to learn how to make cheese consider Carroll's book.
2,Foil Paper,This product is a very delicate tin foil with a holly leaf print. I was looking for a studier foil with a generalized print to cover cake boards with.
4,An extremely thorough review of the Bounty Mutiny,"I gave this book four stars only because it was too thorough, and thus really long for an audio book. Beside that, it was a very good read. The facets of the book are very interesting, in that it touches on multiple aspects that could be books on their own. For example, the treatment of the mutiny court-martial could make a good ""Law and Order"" episode or movie. The open boat trip makes for a study in survival.Although some reviewers criticized the focus on Thomas Heywood, I find it interesting to understand the power to revise history. Indeed, the concept of ""spin"" is an old one. It is amazing how a convicted mutineer could get off scott-free with the right friends and the right spin. It's almost the equivalent of pardoning Squeaky Fromme because she was young and stupid."
3,"Well Researched, Not Quite as Well Written","This is a history book. It's certainly not a novel, nor what I would consider a good read. Naval History is my passion and there were parts of this book I found fascinating. However, I found the narrative to be disjointed, and the book was monotonous to read at times. I would still recommend it, but it's definitely not in the ""book you can't put down"" class."
3,The Bounty,"I enjoyed The Bounty, by Caroline Alexander, except theuse of, ""he himself"", they themselves, she herself, andevery combination of these worthess words.I swear there must be at least 150 to 200, (probably double), of theseunnecessary combinations in this book.There are so many, it's distracting and took away from thereading enjoyment.Does anyone proof read anymore?After reading the Bounty, I started Larry McMurtry's,""Custer.""It has a lot of these ""he himself"", etc. in his book, too.YOU DON'T NEED ""HIMSELF.""What's going on?It's sort of like listening to people that continueto use ""she was like"", ""I was Like"", and ""you know""as Ms Kennedy is so famous for doing.What's happening to our speech and writing?"
3,The Bounty,It's not a bad book. So many books have been written on the subject it's hard to pick one. I have read one other book about the Bounty... it was a smaller book but i felt like it was a better book. This book has a bit of unnecessary info. Stuff that I really wasn't interested in. Stick to the subject. I don't need a book to be 250 pages if the story can be told on 150. It's not bad... but you can find a better book on the subject.
3,In search of an editor,"The amazing tale of this incredible piece of history still manges to survive...but just barely...some of the mangled writing of the author. One feels that one is often reading in some random order the scribbled file cards from her massive, but not coordinated research. Whoever was the editor for this muddle ought to be keel hauled!"
3,Plodding and Boring,"I was so excited to buy this book and couldn't wait to read it.Then, I was so disappointed.Lots of research went into it, obviously, but it's not an interesting read somehow. Not because it's truthful without the myth and adventure, but because it's truthful and plodding. Not what it could've been. I was especially disappointed in the lack of a thorough update on the island and its people."
3,The last used book,"The last used book I purchased was just that...used. But a bargain read anyway. However the book had a failing cover to it. It's more substantial than a regular soft cover but cheap. Once you lose either side and expose the pages...its over.As for the book I believe Ms. Alexander is tough no doubt; but hardly an ordinary seaman in King George's Admiralty. She is bourgeois and probably can be traced to those few British that bathed in those days.Jim KansierNew Iberia, La"
2,Very Dry,"Painful to get through, it was a struggle for me. This book definitely has excellent historical value, BUT it is not a good read. Not very entertaining."
2,Dull version of an exciting story,"Gee, I really wanted to like this book, but I found it dull. The author could have weeded out a LOT of the tiny details. When you give so much detail about every crew members' village upbringing, every letter from every sibling, etc., etc., etc., it's enough to choke on. I ended up skimming through lots of this book, I just didn't need that much background.Do I know what in heck happened on the Bounty? Why the mutiny took place? Not really."
1,"Painful, I gave up",I listened to this on tape and it was painful. Very boring and nothing that I did not know before. Try Nathanial Philbrick's books instead
1,Disappointed,I'd like to know who tested this game. Maybe a frozen screen is part of the game? I better not be wasting my money when I try the second version.
1,Constant Lock ups,"The game itself is great, graphics, sounds, and concept is just like the TV show. The major issue I have with it is the fact that it constanly locks up. I'm running a PIII 733, 512mb Ram, 32 mb Video Card, 16 mb Sound card, and don't have such problems with other games which require a higher minimum system requirement. Due to these technical issues I've encountered with the game, I have not been able to complete it. It becomes extremely fustrating, especially if you've got something and getting hotter and closer to cracking the case. If it wasn't for all this lock up, the game would be great. The game is worth 1 star, even if there was an option for no stars, it still is worth 1 the 1 star I gave it."
1,Flawed,I had trouble with the game from the very beginning. I thought it was my computer and even had it looked at. Then I took the game back to the store and the person at the returns said she had three already come back that day and it was only noon.I love the show and I really regret not being able to play the game. It looks like it would be alot of fun. I was glad to read that it wasn't just me and that so many others were having problems. I hope they can get it fixed.
1,Would be fun if it didn't have a time frame,"There is way too much stuff to be picked up and sent all over the place for testing and researching and whatnot. Unfortunately, some witnesses are only ""unlocked"" after you submit the right item, so unless you're quite fast picking up stuff etc. you can't solve the case within the allotted time frame.This game would be very interesting and entertaining if they didn't cut off the investigation after a week (that's game time, not real time)."
4,Loved both Law & Orders.,"I gave four stars because I want them to continue to make these types of games and without the bugs it is a fun game. I only play and buy adventure and mystery games. The second one didn't have any bugs for me and they made a few improvements, for example they got rid of the time limit and added checkmarks to the notepads.If you have Javaw.exe error or Can't Start? Try This.After applying the necessary patches for the 2-CD or 3-CD:I have the 3 cd version and would get the javaw.exe error and application has to close message, so I couldn't even start the game (played it before but didn't finish, but didn't have that problem the first time.)Solution=You have to always start the game with the first disc after quitting game.open cd disc drive on my computer or windows exploreropen disc oneopen install folderopen lawandorder (the application)then wait and opening will start"
2,Save Your Time and Money,"I am a huge fan of Law and Order and could not wait for this game to be released. Unfortunately, this game has so many bugs, I could not bear to finish it. Between the constant lock ups and waiting forever and a day for the lab to process my evidence, the game is just plain boring. If you want an interesting, solid detective game (with more than one case), I would highly recommend CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (even though I think Law and Order as a television show is much better)."
3,"What you don't know, can hurt you","I agree with a fellow reviewer on the box not listing all the needed requirements. We had to download upgrades to our NEW computer to even play this. Otherwise the screen would go black at certain points and shut down. It seems you need Direct X 8.0 The creators of Law and Order are negligent in telling you this so I hope you have internet access in order to get the patch from their website. Anyway, after you get everything you need downloaded and figured out; then it is an enjoyable game, but if you aren't willing to go through the inevitable hassle, please don't buy this game."
1,"Technically flawed, boring plot","Technically the game is a mess. Bugs, glitches and crashes plague the game from the beginning. The gameplay is horribly flawed and much of the game doesn't get right what other games have been doing right for 15 years. They use an FMV format but ditch live actors for bad pre-rendered models.The plot is boooring. Instead of the typical way things are presented in the show, the game is almost forcively telling you to think different people did the crime when it's obvious they did not. There is no investigation, you jump through hoops the designers laid out to force gameplay mechanics on a flimsy story. None of the charectors are intriguing, they all fall flat. Everything is cliche'd and it all screams third-rate."
5,Just in time for the holidays,"I found Dead on the Money to be quick-witted and quite intelligent while remaining a lot of fun. I encountered a minor technical glitch which was quickly corrected by contacting customer service. I feel that this game is a great gift that'll fit a variety of interests - perplexed aunts and uncles, take note. ""Dead"" can easily outlast all the other one-shot games that have retired to the shelf to gather dust."
4,Cool game - just like the show.,"The best part about this game is the feeling you are working with the characters. The character voices are cool. The game is set up just like the show. The story was interesting, and it was cool that I didn't know what was coming next, just like the show. There were twists in the plot.There isn't a lot of action or fast game play - its more about solving puzzles and figuring out the story. If you like doing that while watching the show, I think you'll like this game."
5,Awesome..! Must have..,I just got this game by ups..couldnt wait to install ..game is just like the shows..kepted me on my feet and i couldnt walk away..is a def must buy for everyone..major 5 stars to legacy
2,Have yet to see if it does as it claims!,"The game, received as a gift last Christmas, has yet to see ""the light of day"" in my household. During the initial forty minute installation time, the disc ""froze"" resulting in an incomplete process.I'm glad my favorite TV detectives/lawyers don't operate this way.They'd never solve a case if they did.'Couldn't give it ONE STAR because I'm such a devotee' of the series."
1,party pooper in Brooklyn,"I am sorry to rain on everyone's parade, but I did not like this book at all. I am interested in becoming a better weaver of stories for my young children. Instead of a how-to guide, I found a wispy, dreamy meditation on stories. It offered some suggestions for setting the mood and beginning the story, but then, when I really need help, on the development of a story, story-arc, what to do when you get stuck, etc -- nothing at all! Also, the art of storytelling can be taught without deprecating comments about the ""coldness"" of books. A real turnoff! I skimmed through the second half of the book and promptly deposited it in a give-away pile. I would send it back to amazon but the binding is broken."
4,Pagan Origins of Mormon Temples,"Often the scholarly become so involved in proving their thesis that they lose sight of where they are going. In other words they can't see the forest for the trees! Such is the case with Nibley's Temple and Cosmos. Although very informative and well documented, in his zeal to justify the existence of Mormon temples by showing many amazing similarities to temples and temple rituals of the past, he fails to notice that nearly all of his examples are from pagan cultures. Nibley proves well that the origin of Mormon temples is paganism. While the Mormon Church claims its origins stem from ancient Hebrew culture, any real evidence supporting such a claim is conspicuously absent from Nibley's book. ...Go figure!"
3,solid,"The latest project from Winston-Salem music scene fixture Jeffrey Dean Foster is a solid mix of what we know today as alt.country (or No Depression or twangcore or whatever you want to call it) and Tom Petty-style power pop. Most of the arrangements are unadventurous but pleasing; the real strength lies in Foster's powerful songs, which reveal a lot more depth than those by most practicioners of this style. The potential for greatness is there. Solid, enjoyable stuff for fans of Six String Drag, Whiskeytown, early Wilco, Blue Mountain, etc."
5,A lovely Holiday Barbie,"At the last minute my daughter decided she wanted a Holiday Barbie. Since I like to shop online and did not want to spend much, I immediately went to Amazon to find one. This Barbie is beautiful and modest! The seller was extremely responsive to me and had this to me several days before Christmas despite my late order date."
3,not bad,This is a devoted fan's in depth look at Stephen King's movies up to 1986 so it obviously leaves out several films. The book is in a tabloid format and is mostly a picture book. It gives a description of each movie and who was in it and why it failed or succeeded.
2,I do not recommend this.,"Despite the reviews I had read, I decided to buy this Firm pack. I am a big fan of the Firm but this is my least favorite set of workout videos. The routines are very complicated and you can barely hear the instructor's voice over the music which makes matters worse. It's hard to hear the queuing and I got very frustrated. Unfortunately, I wouldnt recommend this workout collection to anyone."
4,"Short Text, But Says So Much","Suitable for 4-8 yrs. More authors, or college Enlish Composition courses should pay attention to this author. Angela Johsnon has a way of expressing mountains of information using few words. She has a rare gift for helping the reader to really identify, on a personal level, with the story.The story is about a moving day for a family. That's it. But, the author tells the story in such a compelling way, that it will surely evoke a dialogue about this, or similar experiences between parents and children."
5,Best Documentary I Have Ever Seen,"I'm a huge fan of documentary cinema and was excited but not necessarily expecting great things going into this one. After having left the theater I can honestly say that out of the hundreds of documentaries I have watched in my life this is by far the best filmed, the most engaging, and the most inspiring one I have ever seen. I knew and cared little about the Japanese dolphin slaughters before watching and left considering myself well informed and fairly passionate about the issue. If the ability to inspire is your criteria for a great documentary than I submit you can find no better documentary to purchase than this one."
4,the cove,"The CoveI could not rate this movie 5 stars as I didn't ""love it"" - but found it a shockingly enlightening film/documentary about a horror occurring in Taiji, Japan, while simultaneously capturing the beauty of dolphins, peoples' love for marine life and efforts to stop an atrocity; especially Ric O'Barry, the man who feels he started it all with ""Flipper"" -and how he is determined to end it.Included, is a tale of people from different walks of life, all touched by this ordeal and how all band together with Ric for a great purpose.IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE, THIS IS A MOVING FILM. Which way it will move you ... I can't say. I feel this is one film that needs to be seen. The reasons become apparent.Based on true events, there is a story here that keeps this from being just another documentary.The soundtrack is well selected. The underwater footage is beautiful, where it is meant to be."
4,A Question of Disappointment,"The film is exceptonal with high attention getting impact for helping our lovely friends. I attempted to purchase three DVD's from Amazon to help spread the word; but I ended with an order of four DVD's and do not know how this happened. I was a little upset that I had to pay for more than I ordered. Because it is for helping our wonderful friends who can't help themselves in this situation because of our ignorance and lack of gratefulness to them, I thought maybe I was supposed to have four instead of three. I am using two as floating loaners and two as gifts to people whom I believe will lend them out or show to groups. I am no longer disappointed. Anandi Devi M"
5,Missing out on this film is uncool,"I avoided this movie because it seemed like another conspiracy theory documentary; I assumed it must be such a clever environmental guilt trip that giving it a bad review would make the reviewer into a monster.It turns out that's all true!But I didn't think it could be so heartrendingly sincere. I loved it!You can throw all the fancy special effects away. This is the best of film making.Beautiful cinematography that captures one of the most amazing places on earth.Lovable characters and a fast paced story that hits you in the gut.Powerful, tragic, moving, gorgeous, hideously ugly, heroic and ultimately compelling.Some of the images are now permanently lodged in my brain.I now realize how much I was missing out on by avoiding this film."
5,The Cove Review,This film was extremely well made; heartbreaking and powerful. Everyone should watch this film before deciding to go to SeaWorld or any other place that has dolphins and whales in captivity.
3,Depends on Why You're Watching,"If you're watching this movie for research/information, it's very one-sided. However, it does present many questions about the treatment of animals in other countries. The problem is that getting between a country and a source of revenue results in similar problems to when a country gets into another country's war/freedoms. It's a moving story though, certainly. They did a great job of presenting it to appeal to a large host of people, but it is biased."
3,Shocked.,"I'm a Japanese and I was shocked to know that people kill the dolphins and even eat the meat. This film gave us a chance to think about anti-whaling thing which is considered to be a racial issue here in Japan.I don't think the U.S. government take this problem seriously or there's something which prevent them from taking decisive action, because I'm sure it isn't difficult for them to stop them killing dolphins and whales by just a simple phone call to our prime minister. If you know or not, the U.S. government can change anything which we can hardly achieve by ourselves."
5,The Cove,"It is a film that not all of us can watch. it is not for entertainment and not the movie to past the lazy afternoon.After watching it, it will force us to re-look at how we treat other living things,sharing mother earth on land and sea.Take a look at our eating habit, it is getting out of hand. It is time to change and eat more green.I have purchased the movie ""Shark Water"", I have not taken shark fin soup since. It is individual and I choose to take the message. Thanks to all those involved in one way or another to bring all these shows to the public.""Respect and protect life"""
5,Dolphin slaughter for profit!,"I was amazed at what this documentry revealed. The DVD coverage was beautiful, yet horrifying.It was fitting that Flipper's trainer was very much involved with the telling of the Truth.If you can stomach the blood and guts, you should see this DVD.I think it was very well done and a great learning experience."
5,An eye opening experience,"The first time I watched this movie I was sick to my stomach.. My eyes could not believe what they were seeing, my heart was so scarred and destroyed as I watched the reality and cruelty of this world. to the most unoffensive animals in sea. Its an eye opening film about a man who wants to undo the hurt that he has cost these animals by having helped Film the Show 'Flipper'... But not only that The Japanese are doing a very discusting thing that NEEDS TO STOP! NOW and FOREVER. They are killing our animals and KILLING PEOPLE by POISONING them selling them Mercury for meat. Over all.. this film is a bit too harsh for children to watch but Kids 13 and up I think really need to be aware of the things that are happening in this world and should be able to handle it."
1,it doesn't work.,i bought the 3 pack. and can't get them to work. i have an older one that i bought and it works fine. but the new 3 pack that i bought from amazon doesn't work at all.
2,Not sure if it helped,This product didnt seem to help my son much. It is also a ridiculously small package for the price. One tube is done in a month if you are using it everyday.
3,Works,Ok well weve tried plenty of teething helpers and this was alright. i dont really know if it last longer then the regular formula. But i dont think it does in my opinion
4,Great journal,This is a great journal. Great information about your toddler's development and space to write notes about your toddler. A great way to document and keep track of what is going on in your toddler's life.
5,toddler journal,I love this book! It provides very helpful developmental information that is always VERY accurate and also provides great prompts to help you journal about your toddler. I would recommend it to anyone!
5,I'm so glad someone gave this to me!,"I love to journal in my scrapbooks, but I seem to never get to those as much anymore. This little book provides me just the right amount of space, and thoughts from week to week. I am amazed at how accurate the week to week development descriptions have been for us! This is WAY better than those What to Expect books!I'm going to recommend to all my friends."
2,Not what I was looking for...,"This book has a odd format. It has a few pages for every few months where they talk about what you toddler is supposed to be doing, etc. The some questions (many often felt unrelevent to the age) and an area to ""journal"". It just wasn't for me. I found that writing into a word doc on my PC to be much easier and free. Then I printed it out and put it in his baby book (I never have time or remember to write it in the baby book when I'm at home)."
1,Crashes Windows Vista,Using this product results in Blue Screen of Death in Windows Vista. Akai has no plans to support Vista with driver updates.
2,A bargain. But now obsolete.,"Yes, the MPD16 is a bargain right now, since they've been superceded by the Akai MPD24, as well as other competitors' models (Korg PadKontrol, M-Audio Trigger Finger). The MPD16 is an acceptable but very basic drum controller, so long as you don't try running it on USB under Windows XP (I have no idea about Vista). The drivers are well known to regularly cause blue screen crashes in XP. I am doubtful that new drivers will ever appear for Windows or Vista. However, the MPD16 is stable if run as a midi-only interface with an external power supply, with no USB connection to your PC. But with this loss of USB functionality, you'll want to spring for $200 and get one of the newer drum controllers mentioned above."
1,Right wing screed,"I've long been a huge fan of Card's, however this book is wretched. The plot is straight out of some wingnut's fevered imagination with a style about at the level of freshman creative writing. Apparently he feels so strongly about the message that he didn't see any need to cloth it in a believable plot or even mediocre writing.That brings us to the message, delivered with a sludge hammer. If you think Rush Limbaugh is more reliable than the New York Times, Bush was the greatest president ever, soldiers are Boy Scouts with guns, and that Move On has fleets of black helicopters staging right now in Canada, you'll love it.For everyone else with a firmer grasp on reality, it's a blatant right wing screed."
1,Simply Awful,In the afterword Card complains about the Left - Right schism that is afflicting the U.S. and identifies himself as a moderate. Don't believe it. Card has snapped his tether and is floating weightless in some Glenn Beck right wing fantasy.
1,Wingnut pablum,"This is a terribly written right wing ""what if"" novel that I wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy. I believe that books are sacred, but this marks the first time I have actually thrown a book in the trash."
1,"Great Potential, Poor Execution","OSC has always been a personal favorite author. However, he needs to stay away from writing about contemporary or near-contemporary politics. In this book, he creates right-wing heroes and flat left-wing caricatures. People who think that left-leaning people are somehow evil and plan to take over the world will probably like the book. For those that don't see politics in black and white, the complete bias that the author brings will probably leave a sour and unpleasing taste in your mouth. Lets hope OSC stays in the past or the future--and leaves the present to others."
2,"Good idea, bad book",What in the begining is set up to be a great book takes a steep nosedive around Pg. 20 and just continues the trend. Why beat the book up for the simple worldview of Republican=Good Democrate=Bad when there are so many other negative things to say about it?The book poses an interesting question about America finding a sense of itself in the 21st Century and then all pretense of plot are thrown away.if Card considers making a part two we need more Philosophical conversations and less killer robots.
2,Forget Politics,"Forget right-wing rants, the problem with the book is outrageously bad dialogue alternating with mediocre dialogue. The plot -- sub-Return of the Jedi walkers as effective weapons to invade New York City with is a small, but I hope helpful example of the sort of thing the book asks you to accept -- only makes sense part of the time. In sum, I don't care how good of a writer Mr. Card is, this particular book is fatally wounded by technical flaws.Forget ""right-wing rant"". For one thing, I'm not sure that progressives were the villains of this book any more than extreme conservatives. In fact, the author states this clearly in an afterword. Why not give the author the political benefit of the doubt as giving people the political benefit of the doubt seems to be what this book is designed to advocate. Give the author respect as a fine writer. But, do not pretend that this book is anywhere close to well-written."
1,What have you done with Orson Scott Card?,"I have read every single one of OSC's books so when Empire came out it wasn't a question of ""if"" but ""when"" I would get it. I hesitate giving it a single star but relative to his other works it really is quite miserable.I won't address the political observations within the book - partly because I consider myself a conservative and probably agree more than disagree with Card's views, but mostly because the character development and dialogue were so poorly done that any issues with politics will almost certainly be moot. Character conflict and moral dillemas have long been a hallmark of OSC's work but in Empire, it's as if a guest writer was trying to write typical OSC dialogue - and failed utterly.I sincerely hope this was a merely a stumble in an otherwise fantastic body of work."
2,Propaganda on the level of a D.A.R.E. pamphlet,"I've been a fan of Mr. Card since the sixth grade when I read Ender's Game. I've read all his sequels and prequels for the series and I enjoyed all of them to some degree. I'm sorry that I can't say the same for Empire. In this book Card portrays the world with his narrow political view - an agitprop for Bush and the ""war on terror"". I can only recommend the book if you enjoy right wing talk radio and think all professors at major universities are horrible America hating liberals et al."
2,Disappointing,"I have been a fan of Orson Scott Card for years. I loved the Bean & Ender Series and would picked up a book just because his name was attached without the usual research, recommendations from friends, reading reviews, etc. After reading Empire, those days are over. This book was a disappointment and I felt I was reading a piece of propaganda for the right wing rather than a meaningful piece of fiction.Empire is a quick read, fine for a rainy day if nothing else is available. The characters are shallow and the plot predictable. The book is more of a soapbox than anything else. I guess that's his right to use his publishing clout anyway he wants, he has earned it. It is also mine to look elsewhere for my reading selections."
1,A few good laughs,"OK, let's see, the American left, who couldn't mount an effective response to GOP congressional aides rioting in the Broward County election office, are still PO'ed over Al Gore decades later. So they raise an army equipped with wonder weapons the Pentagon has never seen and start taking over states. It's up to two intrepid soldiers, with the help of Bill O'Reilly, to restore America to its righteous redness and save the country from universal health care or something.It's such a great premise for a novel, I can't believe no one ever thought of it before.No wonder nobody invites this guy to sci-fi conventions anymore."
2,Such a missed opportunity,"The premise was an excellent one, but the execution lacked imagination which, given the author, was a huge surprise. The writing in this book and the easily dated references make it seem as though this book was hurriedly written and put on the shelf before the current political climate changed and the book became dated.If you want to read this book and get any enjoyment out of it, read it before Bush leaves office.I expected so much more from this premise given Card's abilities. I think he threw away infinite possibilities."
1,What Happenned to Mr. Card?,"I loved the Ender series and 7th Son Series, and was excited to get this. It was obvious he was trying to drive home a political point, but I found the point of the book failed and that is why I give a 1 star review. The story is probably a 2-3 star effort, but since it seems Mr. Card is trying to warn about the evils of polarization, the book does nothing to satify that except maybe scare you into it, sort of like the warning codes for terrorism that seemed to die after the last Presidential election. If anything, the book is just Mr. Card's utopian panacea that does zero to bring that to fruition, and that is a shame. Good idea, just did not work for me.Thus, the book was a flop, which is shame"
4,Sci-fi Thriller that Delivers,"Empire is a terrific read with a suprise twist towards the ending that will shock any reader into submission! This is one of the few political sci-fi thrillers that I just couldn't put down. My only beef with the book is that Card's sci-fi robotic villians don't wring true to me, while his other sci-fi elements do. Other than that, the book was terrific and fun and I recommend it.By the way, yes it is a book slanted to the Right side of aisle, and that's okay by me."
1,Poor OSC,"When did he start getting so angry? I don't think his political views came first, I think his abilities have gone down the toilet and that makes him angry. Unlike some older authors, Card has not not shown any new insight. so let's blame it on the liberals who put up with his kookiness when he knew how to tell a good story, but now that he can't do even that, just find him odious."
3,It was ok...,"It seemed to me that the book was pitched as a semi post-apocalyptic story on a civil war in the United States. That is only partially true. It is a story of a civil war in the U.S., but not a very widespread, or even threatening secession by a small group. The civil war doesn't even feel very realistic as the tech involved is slightly out there.What redeems this book is that it serves as a warning that the right and left need to set aside their differences or risk tearing the nation apart, something that does feel very real in this political climate. The politics, and not the military action make it worth picking up, but beware- if you are looking for the standard Card fare of exciting combat, you are in for a letdown."
4,Average Card book (which is very good),"Almost harkens back to Heinlen, in both good and bad ways. If you liked Card's ""Folk of the Fringe"" books, you'll like this one; it has a similar feel. This book has even more of an an action-novel appeal than the 'shadow' series; nice, but my favorite part of Card's writing is where he deals with more interpersonal/societal issues."
5,Thought provoking book,"I found the sequel to this book on sale, so had to have book one. Enjoyable reading, makes you think about what could happen in our country, not too far fetched."
1,the great liberal? conspiracy,"It's a somewhat bizarre viewpoint: there is a greater ""liberal"" conspiracy in existence that is evil. However, the great ""conservative"" conspiracy will rescue us from ourselves. If we consider the larger number of events that transpired during both the Nixon and Cheney presidencies (I did not misspeak), I must come to the conclusion that this work is deeply flawed by the biases of the author.Don't justify actions that are evil for some concept of a mythical ""greater good"" that really doesn't exist."
1,Wow was this a bad book,"I like Orson Scott Card. I think he's a good writer with a lot of interesting ideas. All of that said, this is one of the worst books I've ever read. I really can't think of a single redeeming feature about this book. The writing is poor and unimaginative. The characters are static and uninteresting. And the plot, as much as one exists, is so wooden and full of holes that the Swiss want to market it as cheese.Perhaps the worst thing about this book (and that is saying something) is how shallow the narrative is. While there certainly is something to be said about fraying of American society, Card's reliance on cheap and unthoughtful stereotypes is pathetic. Card treats the American people in his book like unthinking drones dedicated to one radical ideology or another. While Card's world free of nuance may have made for easy writing, it makes for painfully bad reading."
1,Video game or book?,"I loved Enders Game and some of his other stuff. And as I started this book, I thought, man this guy is good as you read about Rube, his history and motivations. But then things go haywire. It starts to read more like a script from a video game. Another thing is that as I read I kept thinking did I miss something? A major event happens and he obliquely refers to an earlier event that I actually thought I may not have remembered. First couple times I went back and tried to find something, but after awhile I gave up and just kept reading. I did finish it but only to finish it. Sorry OSC, I think you should have just backed the game and left it at that. If you wanted to present your political views (and thats fine, I don't have to agree with them), it doesn't come across well in to me, what ultimately reads like a narrative from a video game! Get it at the library."
1,"Sad, sad, sad","Orson Scott Card has created some of the most interesting stories of his generation. His list of successes would be the envy of many an other author. And now......this, this, this.....well, story. For one of the most skilled authors in the US, he decides to tell a convulated, inplausable, and thinly veiled political rant. True, he tells it well, but.......jeeez what a waste of talent. Although his previous works will stand alone, the taint surrounding this effort surely saddens all readers that appreciated said previous efforts. Please, OSC, revert to to the old OSC. Some authors track record make it easy to pick up their new work without much thought. After this book, buyers should use caution."
2,Very disappointed.,I have always been a fan of Orson Scott Card. I have a short list of authors I trust enough to buy their books as soon as they're released. After reading Empire I will be waiting for reviews before spending my money. The quality of this story was very disappointing.
3,Aaaaaaaaaaaaargh!!!!! Horrific!!!!!!!,"The plot's pretty implausible. The military characters are similar to those from Ringo's ""Von Neumann's War"" or Crichton's ""State of Fear"". They're just too damn ready for the assault when it happens: they react too quickly, they recover too quickly, they're just too damn superhuman.Meanwhile, the machinations of the political class are too-well telegraphed (you should be well-able to see where Torrent's going by about page 210).What's left? Well, an unexpected death, necessary to keep reader sympathy. And not much else. It all unfolds pretty much as expected.This is not ""Ender's Game."" Two levels down, at least. Sorry to say. I mean, the gulf is wide enough that I was even sorry to see that both books use the word ""jeesh"". It works in one, but definitely in the other.I guess the Card's upside has to be that I paid full price at Border's."
1,Not up to his usual standards,"I'm a big fan of OSC, but I gave up on this after a few chapters. The characters are barely fleshed-out caricatures, and the proselytizing is very patronising. Shame on you, Mr. Card."
2,Jumpy Story and Inconsistent Characterization,"Card can do much better than this book. The story's flow was herky-jerky. There were some characters on the way to being very developed who just disappeared and other non-developed characters that came out of nowhere to play a major role in the story.Nonetheless, Empire is still a page turner and I'd recommend it as light reading if you cannot get enough OSC after reading his better stuff - The Maker and Ender Series ..."
2,a nice idea...,"The plot could have been really good if Card had done a lot more character development. There were too many points in the book where a character steps out of no where, does something critical, and is never heard from again. Many scenes leave much to be desired if you're looking for something more then basically the novelization of any major Hollywood action movie."
3,Needless Interjection of Card's Ideology,"While the novel is excitng enough, Card's protracted introduction of his own ideology into the book cheapens it, and makes it into more of a tirade against leftist thought. The fact that the bad guys are Democrats and the good guys are Republicans doesn't add much to the plot. (Though to be fair, the submissive wife of the protaganist claims to be a Democrat)A fascinating scenario, and reasonable read, but probably not worth the money. Get it from a library."
1,send a telegram,"( I did not buy from Amazon. Review is based on hard-cover library edition. )After reading the first few chapters of this novel, I suspected the author had a no-so-hidden political agenda. As has been pointed out by several reviewers (both favorably and unfavorably), the book's central premise is a new American civil war between liberals and conservatives. As much as Orson Scott Card would like this to be a novel of great ideas, the sweep of history, and the fragility of our political system, at hits heart ""Empire"" is merely a political screed designed to advance today's Republican agenda.Plus it's very poorly written. I now yearn for Clive Cussler's stark realism and disciplined prose. That's how poorly written it is."
1,A Total Mess,"Empire is such a mess of a work that I'm not entirely sure that Orson Scott Card really wrote it. You'd like to believe that such a slipshod offering was ghostwritten by someone else to whom Card merely lent his name for marketing reasons.This book contemplates a revolt by forces secretly financed by a very poorly disguised George Soros. The book is so poorly written and conceived that it is unconvincing in all respects. Empire reads more like right-wing fan fiction than anything else. It's like a sci-fi pulp version of the Turner Diaries.Definitely give it a skip. Glad I got it at the outlet, at least."
4,"Great premise, but....","I heard the interview of Orson Scott Card on the Captain Dayle Dye Show on KFI out here in LA, and just had to get this book. I had great hopes for the story, which started out great, but the story is somewhat disjointed. The action sequences were a little hard to follow, the dialog between the soldiers was too unreal, honestly. I was a sailor in the Navy, and we didn't talk like this, not nearly that calm when if we were in battlestations or ready for combat, and we never even came under fire. The introduction of the ""mechs"" was a let down, I think. Had he stayed with the type of weaponry that the cover shows, updated tanks, helo's and infantry gear, the story would have been much more believable.I'd still recommend that anyone read this book, as it was a great story, and a terrifying look at the next possible Civil War."
5,Book review,"I know this book did not get a good official review, but given the past several years of mud slinging rhetoric from the political parties this makes a really relevant possible story. This is the second time I read this book and I still enjoyed the book and its story. Red and Blue states along with the states rights causes that are erupting around us because we feel that the Feds are not taking seriously the needs of the states make this a very realistic story."
1,I Love Card..I Hate this Book,"i knew ahead of time i may have issues with the political aspects of Empire. However, I am an avid Card fan and absolutely love his writing. This book does not seem to even be written by him. It is full of typos. It is predictable. It is poorly written.I am so disappointed. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
1,Lefties go Hog Wild,"A dopey book. I'm not a defender of either Red or Blue, but his scenario is ridiculous, his characters have the charisma of empty beer cans, and the whole thing seems to be a cartoonish Warning along the lines below:Beware! George Soros may attempt a military takeover of the USA in the cause of Extreme Leftiness!"
2,"Who wrote this, really?","Let me begin by saying that I am a big fan of Orson Scott Card. His books are thought-provoking, intelligent, and insightful.This is precisely what leads me to conclude that Card could not have written this book. It's just bad. The author understands little about politics, the media, or even religion. This was written by some right-wing hack who flunked out of the English department at Princeton, and thinks it was because of a liberal conspiracy, rather than because of his lack of ability to write or think.The portrayal of Islam is straight out of the Fox News handbook, and bears no resemblance to the balanced way Card has treated other religious views in his writing. Card's complex understanding of the nature of power (see Ender's Game) is nowhere evidenced in this book. This is much more Ann Coulter than Card."
3,Disapointing,"I got this book because it had a very interesting premise - a civil war between the left and the right. Considering the level of political discourse we have right now, it's not that far-fethced an idea. However, the first half of the book gets bogged down in the details regarding a conspiracy to assisinate the President. Then Card turns the book into a laughing stock be intoducing rebels equipped with giant robots and hoverbikes. The book then concludes with a rip-off of a 1970s James Bond movie - valiant commandos sneaking into an underground headquarters of an evil billionaire who wants to rule everything.This book could have been so much more entertaining if the rebels had been more realistic - get rid of the robots and hoverbikes - and made more plausible."
3,"Intriguing, but Lacking","Empire opens with intrigue and promises to draw the reader in for a captivating look at a potential future for America, but it slows in the middle and fizzles at the end.Orson Scott Card here envisions the potential downfall of America's stability, and he creates a unique path to the nation's collapse. In the book, political incivility reaches new heights as Right and Left collide in violent hostilities. As Card himself describes at the end of the book, modern political discourse has gotten so full of vitriol that it does not have too far to go before it may spill over into violent actions. This book stands as a fictional representation of what such a conflict would look like.Ultimately, Empire slides too far into political commentary and the story's plot devolves from intriguing to farcical by the book's conclusion. Card has done a great job to envision a novel picture of America's future, but the book feels rushed and poorly-written as it nears its end."
2,Good concept but surprisingly amateurish dialogue,"This type of genre is right down my alley -- military SCIFI/ and conspiracy. Sort of a Six Days in May for the 21st century. But OSC has two distracting habits in this book:1] He allows lightning to strike many more times than twice to key characters.2] He moves the story along with dialogue by simply putting quotation marks around what is really just amateurish narrative. E.g. this random passage pg 301:""I'm a sworn soldier of the United States of America, performing my duties according to orders,"" said Cole, ""You're a hired goon of XXX XXX, functioning as his private army in order to subvert the United States.""Well I also happen to be a ""sworn soldier of the United States of America"" and I have never used (or heard any other soldier use) stilted dialogue like this.All that being said, I'll probably buy the 2nd in the series if it comes out."
1,The syntax was so bad I stopped reading. Which is why I gave it one star.,"I had never before read anything by Orson Scott Card. So I didn't know what to expect. I started reading with great interest. But as I tried to read, sentence after sentence, something seemed wrong. Because it seemed that many sentences ended and started where there should have been commas. Which meant that the syntax, or lack thereof, overwhelmed the development of the characters and the plot.I made it through the second chapter. At which time I found myself unable to contine reading. So I stopped.Maybe it's a style thing. And I just don't get it.Seriously, I never expected anything written this poorly. It's like whoever wrote it doesn't get compound/complex sentence syntax and how to use commas. Just about all the reviews of this book are easier to read than the book itself."
5,AN EYE-OPENING CARD IS DEALT,"CARD IS A PROLIFIC (THANK GOD!) MASTER STORYTELLER. IT'S NOTABLE THAT SEVERAL WELL-WRITTEN REVIEWS IN THIS LIST SEEM TO DENEGRATE THE POLITICAL POLARIZATION INDUCED BY THE PLOT AND STORYLINE, TAGGING IT TO MR. CARD'S POLITICAL ATTITUDES, WHICH HE OPENLY SHARES WITH US IN THE AFTERWORD.I BELIEVE THAT THIS POLARIZATION WAS AN INTENDED EFFECT, MEANT TO MAKE US ALL OPEN OUR EYES TO THE EVER WIDENING GAP BETWEEN THE POLITICAL EXTREMES NOW OPERANT IN AMERICA. THE CHILLING FACT IS THAT THE STORY COULD BE VERY CLOSE TO A NEAR-FUTURE REALITY, NOTWITHSTANDING THE FUTURISTIC WEAPONRY.THE BOOK WOULD MAKE AN EXCELLENT MOVIE OR TV DRAMA (HOPEFULLY A SERIES), EXPLORING WHAT WE CAN DO IN THE NAME OF HUMANITY AND LOVE TO RESTORE THE BALANCE NECESSARY FOR THE CONTINUED EXISTANCE OF A FREE NATION AND A FREE PEOPLE."
1,Disappointment,"I bought the new OSC book without a second thought as I have always liked his stories, but this was a big disappointment.First of all, I didn't know that this book was a back story to a video game - lame!Second, is is disapointing to see an intelligent guy strive to be even handed, yet his political preferences come through so transparently. (Military = Good, Academia = Bad)Third, the book is boring and predictable. SO disappointing compared to earlier work.Skip the book, maybe the game will be better."
2,Card can do better,Like others I was really disappointed with this book - I'm a huge OSC fan and have found him to be a skilled and deft writer who can has a wonderful skill at bringing out points in a subtle fashion. The conservative bias here was not subtle nor in my opinion well thought through. I personally love a piece on political issues that helps me to see the value of the prespectives of others - this was not one of them.
1,Very Disappointing,"I'm a big fan of Card and picked this up only on that basis. The dust jacket blurb didn't sound promising but, hey, its Orson Scott Card. Well, very disappointed is what I am. The character dialog was not believable and the opening set-up wasn't making much sense. But I thought it really started going south when the mechanical soldiers showed up in New York and Our Heroes just happened to be there! The Liberal-Conservative conflict at the base of this story was hard for me to resolve in the beginning. Not because Card wasn't beating me over the head with it but because I kept thinking there has to be more to this story. It was an easy read so I kept at it. The afterword says Card wrote this as the setting of a video game. Well, I guess it was plotted like a video game. I don't really know anything about Card's politics. He comes across as a right wing nut case in the afterward which explains the right wing nut case conspiracy theory of the book."
4,"Fun, just don't overthink it.","I got this book for free off of a community sharing bookshelf, and enjoyed it immensely. Does Card seem to be making some bold and controversial political statements? Yes. Do I care? Not at all. Is it easy to ignore in favor of the fun characters, great action, and fast-paced plot? Absolutely.I think the key here is that I am not a Card fan. I haven't read anything of his before, so I wasn't expecting anything in particular. It seems like a lot of reviewers wanted to take this book way too seriously, and from that perspective, sure, it sucks. But if you let it be what it is, a silly action novel, then you can have some fun."
1,A major let down,Card has long been one of my favorite authors. I have enjoyed everything that he has written except this. I ended up skimming the last few chapters. What a let down. Its hard to imagine that the man who wrote Ender's Game would put this out under his own name. It was very shallow with no hint of the depths and richness of his other works. I wasn't offended by the political message as it was just so silly.
1,Not Good,"I'm a big OSC fan, but this novel was just horrible. I am also a moderate, and despite what the afterward might have you believe, this book is anything but. It's pretty clear where OSC stands politically, but to try to pass this off as a ""Fair and Balanced"" view is pretty laughable. And even that could be overlooked if this was a well-written book - it's not. Orson, what happened?"
1,It's a good thing I have a good library,"... beacuse otherwise I might have ended up buying this book.Like some reviewers have already commented on, in the long run it doesn't really matter what your political convictions/religious beliefs are, as long as it's a good read. Which this most assuredly isn't. Card, who's given us gems like the Ender-series and quite a few other good stuff as well, well and truly dropped the ball this time.The citizens of NY condoning the murder of it's policemen and firemen? NYs finest wiped out? The NY citiziens and politicos would stand for this and decide it's ok? After 9-11? Good god, but this book has a stupid premise. It's disbelief suspended by the neck until dead, dead, dead."
4,some nice surprises,"Politics aside, this is a pretty good story. It has a couple of big surprises late in the book. What makes it an interesting read is that it is relevant to our times. Thus making the story interesting because you can feel that this could really happen. When I'm watching an action movie sometimes I'll say to myself ""that could never happen."" and I lose interest in it. But the actions taken by the good guys and bad guys seem reasonable and realistic. There is no one Arnold Schwarzenegger character that takes on the enemy all by himself and saves the day. Card does a nice job of letting the audience know that these people are not supermen, that they were put in a very nasty situation and are doing what has to be done to save the United States. But it's too bad that people rate this book based on their political view rather then the story."
5,Comment on other Comments,"OK, so this is more of a comment on the other comments rather than a review. I have not read the book but do know where it is coming from. I can tell that a lot of you that have reviewed this piece of literature don't know where the story came from. This book is part of a franchise (including an XBox 360 Arcade Game titledShadow Complex [Online Game Code] and the upcoming sequelHidden Empire) and was not 100% OSC material, it was in conjunction with Chair Entertainment and Epic Games who asked Card to write this book and work with them on the XBA game. Just wanted to let those that didn't already know this into the loop so as to not think that their favorite author had written something completely different than what they were used to, he was asked to write this."
1,An embarrassing effort and the last Card I'll ever read.,"It takes a lot to make me throw away a several hundred page book with a few dozen pages left to read, but Card pulled it off. In truth, I knew that I was in for a slog early on as the Princeton grad students and the putatively ""brilliant"" history professor, Torrent , engaged in the kind of intellectual discourse you might over hear at a TGI Fridays next door to a community college. I stuck it out through all of the stilted, corny dialogue and simplistic political ""analysis"" hoping to find that the spectacularly implausible Progressive Restoration (replete with hover bikes and robotech walkers) was a ruse. **NOT MUCH OF A SPOILER** It isn't.I find it amazing that this is the same guy who wrote Speaker For the Dead."
2,poor entertainment,"Honestly it seems more of a statement about morals and politics then a story. Major ontrast to the ender series, which while very moral are also slow paced, this is jumping around like it is on crack, and sometimes makes as much sense. Plot is terrible and rather confusing on how it jumps around."
1,Unreadable - even Ender couldn't have saved it,"As a fan of Card's Ender novels, I had high hopes that this would be a quick and enjoyable read. However, I couldn't even get through it. You know you're in trouble when there is a sequence of total implausible acts by the leading characters. Even if you try to suspend disbelief, as scifi readers are able to do, Card bludgeons you with characters who are caricatures of themselves. The protagonist, Reuben, comes from the Paranoia 7 school, except that people are really out to get him. Cole shows up at just the right time and place, and is looking in exactly the right direction, to make a critical discovery early in the novel. This is all just too much to accept. The good news is that I got this book from the public library and returned it before it was due. Save your money."
1,Truly a disappointing book,"How far, far away from the genius of Ender's Game has Orson Scott Card come? This novel is, essentially, a reactonary screed against liberals. Which, depending on your political orientation, may delight or infuriate you. What is truly disappointing, however, is that the novel is poorly written, that its characters are all one-dimensional, and that the plot veers wildly and makes little sense. All in all, it's hard for me to reconcile the fact that an author capable of creating a work of genius such as Ender's Game could put his name on something as abysmally pathetic as this book. Most of the comments in this thread focus on the author's transparent political leanings. They should really focus on the fact that this is simply an awful novel. Don't waste your money, or more importantly you time, with this steaming pile."
4,Divided we fall,"Just read the reviews to understand the point behind Empire. Card thought things were bad when he wrote this during the Bush years. I can only imagine his thoughts today. As for those who say his book is improbable, read the reviews. How could a man who writes sci fi books these reviewers praise suddenly be unable to pen a readable line or come up with plausible characters? Card's writing ability didn't change, only his topic. Liberals and progressives hate Empire with a hint of betrayal that this writer they loved should actually be a conservative. How could he? While conservatives love the book and cheer that they can add his name to the small list of writers, actors and other creative types who dare to go against political correctness.So do you still think his plotline of a civil war between red and blue states improbable? Scary, isn't it?"
1,just garbage,"i'm not even going to touch the political aspect, because it's not what matters - what matters is, this book is just terrible. awful dialogue. gaping plot holes in every chapter. things not explained. one-dimensional characters. pretty much every mistake an author could make - and from such a seasoned veteran, who has written so many amazing books, it hurts me. i want to know who green-lighted this book so i can take their editor hat away from them. and make them eat it."
1,Thank god I got this from the library...,"First the disclaimers: I only read the first 100 pages and I'm a pretty extreme left winger on social issues.I never imagined this book could be so awful. It is essentially a package to present mindless blathering on political issues and uses every canned cliche of the ""liberal media."" I couldn't finish it. I'm so irritated by this book I'm venting it out here rather than waiting a bit and crafting a more decent review.I really enjoyed the entire Ender series and generally have found OSC's other books at least passably readable. However, I seriously doubt I will ever consider picking up another of his books without first getting some glowing recommendations."
4,Empire is another amazing OSC novel,"OSC is my all time favorite author, but like any writer he has his ups and downs. I honestly thought that this one would be a down but it wasn't. It was proving his ever changing skills with words making a thriller unlike any he had before. It does feel like a movie reading it which I normally wouldn't like, but with OSC his characters are always so endeering and you instantly bond with and empathize with them and so the movie aspect actually is acceptable. Rube and Cole will be right in my heart with Ender, Lanik, Jason Worthing, Nafai and Alvin. He is the master of the tragic hero. Joseph Campbell would be proud."
3,Interesting,OSC tries to do a Clancy and it sort of works. I enjoyed the flow of the novel and the author makes a political point about Washington. I admit the authors reliance on Fox and denogration of CCN annoyed me and showed the author's own political bias (everybody has one).For there to be a civil war you need two sides but in this novel there is only one and the US army. If you had two sides and the US Army in the middle it would have been a better novel. If you don't have a heavy bias to the left and enjoy OSC other work and Clancy give it a try otherwise try something else.
1,What was Card Thinking?,"I briefly read through the reviews and thought, It's Orson Scott Card! How can they give it only one star! After reading the first five chapters, I can see why.Absolutely nothing I read was believable. The characters acted and talked so unrealistically I couldn't believe it myself, that the master storyteller who wrote The Worthing Saga and People of the Fringe had actually signed his name to this. I felt even worse not finishing this book than when I realized that that Card's great Homecoming series was just the Book of Mormon fictionalized.Some of Card's non-fantasy works are readable (Lost Boys), but this one wasn't. Card should stick to fantasy and SF where his political views don't get in the way of his writing."
1,"Stink, Stank, Stunk!","Man, going in with high expectations proved to be a grand awful mistake as the book pondered on and on and on and on then OSC tops that slogging by committing the cardinal sin of killing off the primary hero character mid-way through the freaking story! What schmuck would do that?! It would be akin to killing off Neo in the fist Matrix movie and hoping the story would carry it the rest of the way. It was not worth the $1.00 that I paid for it at Big Lots...a clue that it was a remaider stinkeroo."
4,Enjoyable read,"Based on my own system of - How often I put the book down - this was a fun and enjoyable book. Good pace and fairly likeable characters. The plot does require a few leaps, but again, this is fiction. If you're offended by anything that might trend slightly conservative, then I guess this will not be the book for you. However, I'm not sold that a political statement is really where Card was going with this. At any rate, thin skinned reviewers are pretty humorous to me when the vast majority of screed out there is liberal leaning."
4,"Rube is not Ender, Cole is not Bean, and Empire is not a Game","Of course, this is not another ""Ender's Game"". It is hard to be brilliant more than twice (there is also ""Ender's Shadow""), and, if child fighters left some people angry, this is going to do even worse.If you think that brain washing only works ""for the other side"", all military is uniformly good or evil, everything is either black or white, this is not a book for you. There are too many shades of gray and even a couple of color thrown in for good measure.The book is entertaining, have a couple of surprises and twists, leaves you guessing until the last page and is generally worth it.I especially liked the afterword, which reflects the current division in American politics: you are either extreme right, extreme left or a fool (the words most used for the third group cannot be published...). It is frightening to think that it might happen at any moment."
3,Ok book weak for OS Card..,TItle to my reveiw says it all! This book had a good premise but i would expect it at a crappy movie theater. It's no enders game!! Still an ok read by any standards. COnsidering what today's standards are!
4,Great replacement,"I originally bought this with the intention of using only the mirror. Some jerk ripped off my mirror so this was the cheapest way to replace it, or so I thought.Not only is the product constructed slightly differently but the way the mirror & motor are attached/assembled is different. I couldn't figure out a way to remove the motor without detaching & potentially damaging the product so I just attached it as is.It's cheap & great but one slight thing I noticed is that the mirror is slightly shaky on bumpy roads. I'm sure the original side mirror had some slight motion but it's noticeable with this one.Not much of a deal breaker, everything else is spot on. I would still recommend this to anyone in need of a replacement.Supreme shipping by National Auto Part!!"
4,Good quality,"The mirror is well made and looks good. Unfortunately they don't sell them painted (silver, etc.). Internal parts are a bit different from the original Honda mirror, so I couldn't use those internal parts with my old silver 'case'."
2,not a stable mirror,"After i replaced my mirror with this one, which is not an easy task. I drove and it turns out that the mirror shakes. :("
2,Description is misleading.,"""FOLDING"" Mirror does not fold. The mirror feels like cheap plastic, and it vibrates a lot while driving on the highway."
2,These footballs used to be great,"My son is a kicker and we needed practice footballs. Typically we have 15. A couple of years ago we bought these footballs and we were very impressed. The worked well for a composite ball, keep their pressure well and wore well. We bought some more, and they just didn't last. I would look elsewhere for a composite ball. Tachikara seems to be having some quality control issues."
1,"HP Warranty Really Sucks - Beware, Should Be Zero Stars","My wife purchased an HP Photosmart 8450 Printer as a Christmas present for me. I installed it and it worked perfectly for one week. Then the colors started to change. Photos had extreme amount of yellow in them, such as yellow faces and hands, no proper flesh tones.I call HP support and was told that my printer was out of warranty because the warranty starts when the printer was manufactured, not the purchase date. I was offered one free call but my call was interrupted because of an appointment that I had. I was given a case number, but when I called HP back stating my case number, they said that this was no longer a free call. I explained it was an extension of the first call, but they refused to work with me.I think HP warranty policy stinks, and would not purchase another HP product as long as this policy stands."
5,Fantastic Printer,Excellent job on photos. Better than having them developed. My only concern is how long the cartridges will last as they are kind of pricey.However at this point I would reccommend the printer. Setup was easy and it works great.
2,LONG term review.,"I have owned this printer for ~ 3.5 years. It worked very well for approximately 1.5 years, had satisfactory performance for the following year, now is abysmal. The print heads are not designed to last the lifetime of the machine. Check the internet. This is dirty secret HP does not disclose readily. ARE YOU SERIOUS HP?!?!? You suck. Your product uses an excessive amount of ink now, requires frequent 'burping' and print quality is lackluster. Very disappointed. If you only want a printer to function for ~ 1 - 1.5 years, then HP products are for you. They do NOT even offer print driver support on models over 2- 3 years old. INCREDIBLE! I had replaced with a HP product and it started performing abysmally as well with 'ink system failure' notifications. Google search it and see the atrocious design of HP. Disgusting. I don't purchase products designed for 12-18 mo of use with NO support after 2 years. I will steer clear of all HP printer products in the future."
5,Have never seen any better ink-jet photographs,"My 8450 printer is almost 9 years old, and still works perfectly, producing the best photo prints of anything I've seen outside of a professional photo lab. It is definitely the BEST printer I have ever owned. But be advised that Microsoft has been slow to provide drivers for Windows 7."
2,Does not print borderless Word Documents,"Does not print borderless Word Documents, it cuts them off and does not print to the edge of the page. HP tech support does not have a solution and will not have. They say it is for photo's only.I also had problems installing the software, incompatable with some computers. HP did not have a solution - I was on the phone for over 10 hours. I finally figured it out myself.I am extremely dissapointed as I had planned to use this printer for printing post cards, brochures etc. for business.Bottom line it is good for photo's only."
2,photosmart 8450,"We were dissaponted in this product. It was in Spanish, Print button flickered on red, CD did not work. We have used other photosmart printers with better results. Thanks again for your service."
1,I wish I'd known!,"I ended up giving it away. After trying to set it up, I found, after a $39 phone call to HP, that HP stopped making this printer five years ago. I could not download the software because it was too old for my iMac's OS. Since it was out of date there was no warranty, and I could not buy an extended warranty. In addition, the machine was so old the ink was no longer usable. I learned all this the hard way, since there was no mention of these limitations in any of the reviews."
5,Happy Customer,this book completes our travis mcgee series. i paid extra for the fast shipping and it did arrive before christmas. the book was new. the smile my husband had when he opened the package was well worth the extra postage!
2,A rare MacDonald miss,"I think this was the 20th book I've read in the Travis McGee series, but it's the first one I didn't like that much. There were the usual profound nuggets of McGee wisdom and philosophy (""Today, my friends, we each have one day less, every one of us. And joy is the only thing that slows the clock."") But MacDonald belabors the intricacies of the plot and declaws the tension when McGee starts asking far too many ""What if...?"" questions."
4,The Scarlett Ruse,"Well, as usual with John D.'s Travis books, there is a twisting and winding story that creates enough intrigue to entice a reader. Yes, it's now a bit outdated, but who cares? Those of us that love and relate to Travis and Meyer can be quite forgiving, can't we? Even if we're trying desperately to find our own local and friendly marinas. The developers are just about to make us anchor out in the big pond."
3,After the Fall,A more pessimistic MacDonald (and McGee) emerges after a writing hiatus of some years. The difference between earlier McGee stories and the 'new' series beginning with Scarlet Ruse is palpable to the devoted fan but not necessarily objectionable: McGee is growing older and so are we; not simply closer to the bone now (McDonald could always take us there) but closer to the end. Yet McDonald's exploration of a free life amidst its war with self and the criminal mind still entertains and instructs. We are not through yet and neither is our favorite beach-bum. See you in Lauderdale.
3,Complex,"This is a Travis McGee mystery. McGee is lured off his boat by a friend whose stamp dealer friend is in trouble. The dealer constructs stamp collections as investments for rich clients. One day, the dealer noticed that the stamps in one of his client's collections had been switched with low grade specimens, significantly downgrading the value of the collection. He's terrified that the client will ask to cash in the collection, leaving him with an overwhelming financial liability. He asks McGee to help him figure out how the stamps were switched, and who did it. Complicating the matter is the dealer's secretary, who McGee finds himself mysteriously attracted to.This story is rich with detail, and it can be hard at times to keep it all straight. The plot goes over the edge of plausibility in places, and the ending has an odd twist that I still can't figure out. Nevertheless, the story remains engaging throughout, and can provide a bit of entertainment or distraction for a little while."
2,unsatisfied.,"earrings were not as expected, seemed smaller, and fake. (although these claims were not investigated, the earrings were returned.) the box seemed handmade. but, fast shipping, and overall good customer service when i returned the item."
2,Hodgepodge of mostly excerpts,"This is a rather superficial compilation of excerpts from chamber and orchestral music. The only reason I even wrote a review is to mention that nearly all of the featured composers on this CD are 20th century composeres from very diverse backgrounds. There is an Arvo Part track, a track by the female composer Libby Larsen (I wish I would see more of this on these mixed CDs), and a beautiful Bagatelle by Miklos Rozsa. I do thank the label (KOCH) for introducing me to Rozsa's music, but other than that, it's pretty much bound for the next garage-sale."
1,WARNING: THIS BOOK IS FILLED WITH INACCURACIES!,"THE ONLY REASON I GAVE THIS BOOK ONE STAR IS FOR THE PHOTOS, ALTHOUGH ONE PHOTO, SUPPOSEDLY OF DORIS, IN ACTUALITY IS JUNE ALLYSON! UNFORGIVABLE! THE AUTHOR OBVIOUSLY DID NOT DO HIS HOMEWORK. HE PAINTS A TOTALLY MISLEADING PORTRAYAL OF DORIS DAY. IF YOU WANT TO READ A GOOD, DEPENDABLE BIO OF DORIS, CHECK OUT HER 1975 BIOGRAPHY, ENTITLED ""DORIS DAY, HER OWN STORY,"" BY A. E. HOTCHNER (""PAPA HEMINGWAY""). THIS IS A GREAT BOOK, HONEST (SOMETIMES BRUTALLY SO!) WITH GREAT COMMENTS FROM DD'S CO-STARS AND BUSINESS ASSOCIATES. TRY TO GET A COPY ON E-BAY...IT'S A GREAT READ!"
2,"thin on photos,emaciated on bio- ,but nice cover and typeset","I expected thin - the book is thin - but emaciated? The author himself says the book was proposed as a picture book and yet the book is thin on illustrations and thin on biographical info, and flat writing for such a iconic woman. What accompanying ""biographical"" info there is, is really only cursory and focuses more on her singing than her acting. (one more mention of che sera sera and I'll go nuts -- and isn't it spelled ""que sera sera""??). ""Illustrated biography"" is hardly a fitting title. The book would have been more aptly marketed as a book superficially chronicling Doris Day's singing credits. The only insightful editorializing the authors puts forth are quotes from Doris's autobiography."
1,I returned it for a refund.,This book is by a well-intentioned but underinformed fan? Supposedly the Brits are huge fans of Doris--this one didn't do his homework. One of the photos (of a lady standing up in a car on the MGM lot) is attributed to be Doris but is a photo of June Allyson!!! That kind of schlock-ily written and edited book does a disservice to the lovely actress/singer.
2,"Love the pictures, but....","I truly enjoyed seeing all of the lovely photos in this book of my favorite star--Miss Doris Day! However, I feel that the author should have kept his opinions to himself and just allowed the pictures to tell Miss Day's story. Much of the information in this book was incorrect; worse still, the photo at the end of the book is of June Allyson, not Doris Day! It seems that the author didn't do his homework :(I recommend that anyone who purchases this book just be prepared to enjoy the photos and not waste time reading it--the photos are lovely (how could they be otherwise?!?)."
5,delighted,"i began many to plasir has to look at the serie,he is domage that there is no season 3...."
5,The Best !!!,"I wish there had been a third season !!!!One and two were GREAT !!!!!Great Actors !Theme/Concept ,Soundtrack , But, it was over too soon....."
2,"Great, but not finished..","""Carnivale"" was one of my favorite shows to watch. It was well written and very well acted. The art direction was genius -- every conceiveable detail of 1930's America seemed to breathe with life on the screen.""Carnivale"" was also haunting. There were elements of the story so freaky I had to watch it with the lights on. And yet it was so captivating I kept coming back for more.So, if it was so brilliant, why only two stars?Because HBO cut this show so short of its potential it was shameful. The show wasn't getting the ratings that the other HBO original shows were, so just when the story was really starting to get interesting, it was cut short. I felt completely hoodwinked as a viewer and fan. This DVD set just confirms it. HBO, with their deep pockets, could have at least given it one more season, to tie up the story arcs more neatly, as a courtesy to the many hardcore fans of this show. Instead they truncated it -- and yet they're still selling it! What jerks."
2,Dissapointing,"I found the first season enthralling and original.It is obvious by the second season that there is no plot and the characters and situations are sensational and maudlin if not corny. Why did HBO cancel a great show like Deadwood and keep producing a grotesque unredeemed production like Carnivale? At the end of season one of Carnivale, the most interesting characters, Lodz (dissapears), the bearded lady and the diminutive Carnival master's roles are diminished and the story slides into the tawdry and incomprehensible. I won't finish watching this series."
5,"FREE AT LAST, FREE AT LAST, THANK GOD THE SECOND SEASON HAS BEEN FREED AT LAST!","The ending of this second season opened up so many doors: hello! Sofie the ultimate evil carrying the ultimate good's baby, perhaps! It had all the mystery and excitement of a moody X-Files, but HBO did not want to pursue this show to its end, just leave us wanting for more.If I could wave a magic wand and bring this show back into existence, I would.I loved this show, I addicted so many of my friends to this show to where they subscribed to HBO, but after aforesaid network decided to give it the axe (how long was that horrible Arl$ss on the air?) we cancelled our subscriptions to HBO and have not returned to watch any of their new shows."
4,Awesome but...,"I really enjoyed watching it. It answered most of my questions from the previous season but it still left me hanging. My husband and I kinda figured the ending. I hope the creators would consider another mini-series to tie up the loose ends, or just make a 2-hr movie. Is that even possible? :-)Anyway, thumbs up on the creators, directors, actors and actresses!!!!"
3,Disappointing in the end,"We bought both seasons of ""Carnivale"" after missing its run on TV. We had heard many positive things about it and given the difference from the norm in plot, time frame (30s), and venue we enjoyed the first season so we bought the second. It was a well done as the first but it obviously begs for a continuation of the story. All the plot angles are left unresolved and one gets no real closure from watching the finale. Well done, enjoyable, but unfulfilled in the ending."
5,"Finally, Finally, Finally","I've been waiting for this show to be released, I've even called the HBO store several times to try to get a relase date. I love this show, the first season is a masterpiece now because of the second season. You can see how everything is set up so well, all the story lines become fulfilled in the second season. I was constantly waiting for each show to be released, waiting for the next week to come around just so I could see what happens. It sucks that they cancelled it in the middle of the story, but oh well, at least I'll soon have both seasons one and two on DVD. A curse on any executive that had a part in its demise."
2,A huge waste of potential.,"The first season of Carnivale was excellent. Great writing. Fantastic acting. Amazing characters. Intriguing setting. Had it continued that way it would definitely have warranted five stars, but it doesn't. The acting remains great, but the story just meanders off course and becomes virtually random. New characters are introduced that serve no purpose to the story, and some interesting established characters just disappear without explanation. Technically the show does wrap up, but the ending is so forced and unsatisfying as to make you feel the whole effort of watching was a complete waste of time. Carnivale had the potential to be one of the best shows ever. Instead it crashed and burned. A real shame."
5,Excellent,"Loved the first season, needed answers! Got them answered in the second season....great great series, disappointed they didn't keep it going. With failed series like Heroes starting out strong, then dropping the ball, along with Lost, this one stands above them all. Maybe it was good they did stop the series before it got ruined by replacement writers, producers, etc."
5,fun to watch,"I owned the first season and watched it a number of times. This seond season is interesting, but the ending still disappoints. Too bad the series only had two seasons. One problem I had with the Cds in this set is that they skipped. It could be my player. Once I took each cd out of the player and blew it off, then blew into my player, they seemed okay."
5,Carnivale: Complete Second Season,The only thing wrong is that the show only lasted 2 seasons. I like the series but hbo did not continue to make the show???
5,Incredible Timing,Incredible timing and wonderful quality. I'd been looking for the second half of this abbreviated series for some time and I'm happy to have had it concluded so quickly for my impulsive nature.
1,Pirated copies!,"WTF!!! Do not buy from this bloke. I wanted to purchase 2nd season of Carnivale to replace a disc I had broken from my boyfriend's ""ORIGINAL"" copy, and thought I would be replacing the original disc. I received a bunch of home copied burned discs. Had I not seen what the original DVD season 2 set looks like, I would have thought it was legit."
5,A Real Keeper,"As others have mentioned...It's a damn shame that they only went for two seasons. I just finished watching the rest of Season 2. I'm glad that they at least did tie up some ends, but then they opened up some new avenues that we never will find out about unless they bring back the show for maybe a two hour special to rap things up for us die hard fans. I doubt there's any plans for that though.Carnivale is definately worth getting even thought there's only two seasons. After season one you pretty much need to get into season two to find out what all the pieces of the puzzle were all about in Season One. Unfortunately much of the puzzle didn't come completely to light, but enough did so at least tie up the story so the reader isn't left hanging."
3,Left hanging,Whas not quite sure how it would end. very dissapointed. I guess it was open for a new season which never happened. It left the viewer guessing as to what happened.
4,Early version of Wait/Waite/Waitt family history,"It's OK as far as it goes, but this is the first (1878) edition. It was revised and reprinted in 1913 with more comprehensive information. The 1913 version is available for download on the internet."
3,An under-appreciated musician,"I bought this after reading her book ""Petal Pusher"" which traces the history of her band Zu Zu's Petals and her own life before and after. The songs are more sturdy than I expected, because, being an EP I was afraid it would be mere leftovers. I came away from listening with a sense that there will be more from Mrs. Westerberg in the future. Looking forward to that...."
3,Magazine's good - pricing is RIDICULOUS!,"The magazine is top notch, but you can subscribe via one of the little post card inserts for 12 months for $24.00. Just an FYI in case you don't really feel the need to shell out $50."
5,What a Great Magazine for Nascar Fans,"This magazine is a 5 star magazine. The paper quality is great, there is great articles and great pictures of the races and the drivers. Its any NASCAR fans magazine."
3,"Great magazine, but order directly from site","My husband and Dad love the magazine (easiest gift to find EVER if you have a race fan in the house), and I am generally happy with Amazon's pricing, but in this case go directly to the site to order. I paid 18.00 for the subscriptions. Have given the feedback on the pricing, whether or not it makes a difference in the long run, who knows."
1,Poor service,I ordered this subscription as a gift for my husband in October and as of January 5 STILL have not received an issue. We actually bought a copy in NC and the postcard in the magazine has it for $18. The number on the postcard is 8008837323.
1,very cheap quality,I ordered this item and believed it would be very nice quality. I was wrong. The beads are wooden and the black color is coming off some of these. The St. Florian medal is simply glued behind the medal of the Mother. The Crucifix is very slim and low quality also. All in all for the price this is a big disappointment.
2,Pretty crappy,"I didn't have a problem with leaves triggering this unit, but I did have an issue with lack of sensitivity. The unit claims to work up to 70', but actually would only turn on around 15'. Detection is good inside that range.It also has a bright red LED on the bottom to indicate when it's detection motion which otherwise stays on constantly. It's so bright that it projects about a 1' red spot on the wall at night.Terrible performance, and you can't turn off the LED light. I'll be returning this junky sensor."
5,Cooper dusk to dawn motion sensor.,This little inexpensive device works great! It is exactly what I was looking for. The carport needed a means of turning on the lights by motion sensor at night but not in the daytime and this does the job. The nearest I could find in other products was a similar device for $86 compared to $18.75 for this one. It is easy to install and set up with clear directions.
3,"Timely, but doesn't fit","The price was right, and the item arrived on time, but it wasn't the right soap dish. From the image on the website, I thought this was the soap dish that I needed, but when it arrived, it didn't fit into the recessed soap holder in my shower. I need one that has little grooves on the sides for short pins to slide into. Since the one I got cost less than the shipping price, I didn't bother to return it. I still don't have one that works."
5,The Ultimate Book About Abel,"Brad Stevens did a magnificent work, that enlightens all the aspects of Ferrara's movies. As a very serious historian, he multiplies the sources of informations, and we discover for example the youth and formation of the film-maker. As a brilliant analyst, he compares each film with a whole range of literary and cinematic works. It's a model in terms of monography about a director.The book is wonderfully illustrated. The filmography is the most complete and detailed.A necessary book for everyone interested, nonetheless about Ferrara, but about American contemporary cinema in general."
1,Waste of Money,"This stuff is used with bleach to kill mold but the bleach alone will do that. This is nothing but snake oil designed to make you believe it somehow enhances the exceptional potency of bleach and water to kill mold. I did a side by side test with this bleach/water and bleach/water/Jomax on my sidewalk, painted white fence, and on my garage doors. The results were identical. Jomax did nothing to improve the cleaning power of the bleach."
1,Would not work with my equipment or local photographers equipment!,I bought this item to run a remote flash off of my digital camera. I could only frequently get it to trigger my flash when held directly in front of my cameras flash. I took it to my local photographer who suggested I buy a peanut slave.(He has been using a non-digital version for a couple of years with his digital camera.) It would not work with his equipment either. I bought the cheaper non-digital version that works great.
3,not bad but...,"if you're looking for some nu jazz or something that sounds jazzy and can make you dance you can buy something better than this. I was anxious of listening to phonography (the first) but i never did (i didn't found in my city) so when i saw phonography 2 i bought it immediately...it's not bad but if you listen to ""saint german de pres"" (1 2 3 the third is the best one) you'll find surely something better. i would recommend it only for fans of the genere since there is even some drum and bass on the last two tracks, it maybe could disappoint someone on these tracks"
1,$8 shipping for a 49 cent purchase ????,"$8 shipping for a 49 cent purchase ????Seems like a rip off, doesn't it?"
3,Hebrew letters stick-on's,"Since my key board failed I had to replace it and purchase a new set of Hebrew letter stickers. The old set stuck so well that I could not remove them.The color of the new letters is a pale red. I have purchased in the past stickers with a fire engine red color and a small black letter of the English alphabet in the upper right hand color, which emulated the original lettering of my key board, unlike the current set."
4,how much can 2 people go through???,"Andrea lives through hell most of the time, especially in the middle and end, and you cant help but sympathize with her. Adam was sometimes harder to like just because of the struggles he went throught and the way he turned to drinking for part of the time. Time he wasted when he could have been supporting Andrea more. But he fully realizes what all of his mistakes cost him at the end when he very nearly loses Andrea forever, but it is plain to see that he loves her very much. Very good book, very tragic and often painful to read."
1,can it be any worse?,Can there be anything worse in a romance than for the couple to be split up and the heroine to be with other men and to occasionally like to be with them? I couldn't believe this book. It went immediately to me get rid of pile. Yecchh?
2,Poor audio quality,"I bought this for connecting my iPod to the auxiliary input in my car stereo. I wanted the 90 degree angle plugs to keep the wires out of the way. Unfortunately, the sound from the stereo is audibly distorted when I use this. If I switch to another cable (even a $2 generic brand) I can immediately hear an obvious improvement in the sound. Fortunately, I didn't waste too much money on this."
1,Looks are deceiving,"The write-up for this cable says that it's coaxial and shielded (the cable jacket is also imprinted with the word, ""shielded""). However, it's neither coaxial nor shielded -- just three insulated conductors twisted together under a plastic jacket. Furthermore, those conductors are so delicate that normal use of the cable breaks them. I found all of this out when two of the three conductors in my cable failed and I thought that the problem was likely in one of the connectors. So I started to replace it, then realized what a worthless piece of junk I was dealing with and threw the whole thing in the trash. Save your money!"
4,Klima Tropico,"I believe that ""Klima Tropico"" is one of the best cd's Anna Vissi has given us because it contains different styles from rock (Oti mou zitisis) to ""zeibekiko"" (Ekatommyria) and ballads (Eleni). I love the song ""Paralyo""; her performance is excellent and it touches me. Eleni is also a very touching song and shows her sensitivity to devote it to her fan Eleni who died from leuchemia. I congratulate Anna Vissi and I love her."
5,Odier is the man!,"Odier's book is an exceptionally lucid, succinct ""handbook"" for those seeking elucidations as well as discussions of The Sacred Texts. This isn't a how-to on specific meditation practices; instead, it is an excellent dissertation on the Texts."
1,The Instruction of Ptah-Hotep,This book was a rip-off. The only thing this book had about Ptah-hotep was the cover. Inside it was all about the Masons - it was a marketing tool. Nothing about Ptah-Hotep!!
3,Very moving with powerfull lyrics and music for todays time,Donnie Harper does it again. His ability to write moving messages in song. His unique soft Gospel/Christian style sets him apart from the Kirk Franklyns and Fred Hammonds but he is all but preaching a message of the power of God with his outstanding Lyrics. You will feel the anointing on every song here. I was pleasantly surprised to find that New Jersey Mass Choir had something out this resent as I have been missing them on the air and in the stores. Thanks Amazon!
5,Soothing,I love my chime ball. When I'm irritated I just shake it and it calms me down. I especially love the chain that came with it.
5,Kant Applies the Architectonic to -- Everything!,"In this book Kant goes wild and applies his philosophical system to everything, particular physics. This should be considered one of the great seminal works of philosophy. It was certainly written by a genius.Was Kant right? Probably. Who knows?"
4,"Nice camera, didn't fit my D90, my fault.","I bought this hoping I could squeeze in my D90... the camera fit fine, but put too much strain on the elastic loops which stabilize the bottom portion. I need to do more research. Adorama had fast shipping."
5,Compulsory read to start understanding our times ?,"An extremely interesting essay by one of the -supposedly- greatest minds of the XXth century, trying to analyze the western world's culture and education system through modern history, with the events of the second world war as a turningpoint - with no possible way back - : how the rise of science and the ""fall"" of God (to briefly summarize it) during the past centuries led to the Shoah, how culture has evolved since then (the book was written in the 70s) compared to what it was before and finally how Steiner think we should proceed forward to avoid repeating mistakes of the past and handle the somewhat scary potential of the future of science. All of it wrapped in exceptional wisdom and culture while very didactic even for neophytes like myself, tainted with a light pessimism, but a pessimism that looks towards the light. Pretty damn good."
5,I wish all my dreams were this good.......,"Complex, progressive, and extensivly eloquent!! One of Monk's mostgenius (literally) recordings; then again what has he done that isn't genius? A definite highlight in the infinite realms of the Thelonious, not to mention the beautiful art of Jazz music. Five stars is an inadequate response to the supurb quality manifested here. A compliment to any music collection."
5,The perfect quartet,"It's clear that Monk's music is appear to be written for saxophone players: Sonny Rollins, Johnny Griffin, John Coltrane and, of course, Charlie Rouse were among his partners. But his last quartet with Rouse is very close like a Jazz Quartet should be. Rouse understanding of Monk's music is very important to play it with freedom and every tune is this title has it. Special mention to Bye Ya. The joy of listen Monk and Rouse together is here."
3,Not my favorite Monk collection,"Granted, this album is significant because it's the first Columbia album by Monk. But it's not my favorite. The music seems lighter and more casual and commercial than I'd like. I much prefer ""The Measure of Monk"" CD, also available at Amazon. I have listened to Monk's ""Ruby, My Dear"" more times than I can count and I will continue to do so, it is fantastic, as is the rest of the collection on that CD."
1,Defective DVD Manufacturing.,This is a very poor quality DVD transfer. Apparently it was transferred to DVD from a bad VHS cassette and has the defects of that source material. It also stops playing during the last fight scene with six minutes remaining to the movie. (I assume the good guys win.) I had Amazon replace my first defective DVD with another and it stops at exactly the same spot. I'm going to get a refund on the second one.It appears to be a bootleg or pirate production. I doubt the company that produced this particular DVD even has the rights to produce this.
5,Dan Seals At His Best!!!,"Before ""Bop"" and ""Meet Me in Montana"", he was a favorite in the 70's folk rock scene.This CD is at his best: his mellow voice and minimal acoustic instrumental.Honest and unadorned songs..Far and away the best rendition of ""I'd Really Love to See You Tonight""."
2,"This CD is not bad, but it still seems a little rusty.","Jennifer Daniels has joined the girl with a guitar club that has become a part of the pop rock music of today. She does have a powerful voice, but at times it tends to overpower the rest of the musical sound. The entire CD mix does not seem to have the feel of a professional finish. It sounds more like they ran out of time and money so they had to go with what they had already recorded. With a little more time to determine what direction she wants her music to go perhaps she will have a better sound. As of now I think there will be those who will enjoy her offbeat melodic sounds and there will be those who will feel that her lyrics and her sound are not their favorite. She is better in concert, so if you are disapointed with the CD sound I recommend seeing her live because then she gets a better mix for her sound."
4,Good protection when not using a full case,"I use this Zing case when hiking or walking around, and it offers good protection when you need ready access to your SLR. The strap that comes with the case fits around your chest/back for a good secure feel. The only thing on this case is that any larger SLR bodies have a hard time fitting. My Pentax K10D barely fits, where as the Pentax *istD fits ok. Also, be aware any telephoto lenses on the body my impeed the fit as well."
5,excelente,He disfrutado mucho de esta antologia editada por dos magnificos escritores jovenes latinoamericanos. Gracias a esta recopilación he podido conocer a magníficos escritores de los que antes nunca escuche. No se pierdan el segundo o el tercer cuento: Pequeno diccionario del spanglish.
3,Have not used this item yet,"I purchased this item after renting this item from the parts store and decided to have one on hand for my daughters car , a 1995 Mustang. The car she had to have."
4,An Evening To Remember,"Lata joked at this concert - ""I hope you enjoyed these songs. I have sung them in the voice of Lata Mangeshkar!"". Known for her ready wit, she is also known to surprise her critics and detractors by churning chart-topper after chart-topper every year. She has not kept up with her prodigious pace of late; she records few songs nowadays, but those that she does, manage to top the charts. Call it a divine gift or a product of relentless dedication and discipline, her ethereal voice has no parallel - even today.And, if proof of this were needed, this collection has a 22 minute medley of 19 songs spanning 50 years which encapsulate her superb artistry. I remember someone who attended one of her concerts outside India telling me: ""Even after the last song, the audience did not stir for a full five minutes; they thought and wished that she'd go on and on...."". This is how I felt after listening to that medley."
2,Three Generations of Boring,"I was told that this book was a courageous tale of 3 generations of a fighting family so I bought it a couple of weeks ago. Let me tell you, it is a yawner.First of all, the writing is horrible. It is as if my sixth grader wrote it and then gave it to my 4th grader to edit. It is very unclear.Second, the author, Leon Robinson, doesn't add anything that hasn't already been discussed about the tradition of fighting families. I had to force myself to read it (generally during bathroom breaks).Anyhow, its poorly written and not well-conceived. But it you like bragging then this book may be for you..."
5,"Good, clean fun","My family of six (ranging in ages from 5 to 52) loves this video. The combination of word play, physical comedy, handyman hilarity, and dry humor is irresistable. If this tape doesn't make your family and friends laugh out loud, check for a pulse. Long Live Uncle Red!"
2,incorrectly marketed,This tape is less than half the length of the same titled show on a DVD leaving out the funniest parts
3,"Live- You can feel the energy, after awhile it gets to be a bit much","It is obvious that The Dropkick Murphys are energized by their fans and this set of hard pounding numbers are sure to enthrall those same fans, but unless you are very familiar with this band, I wouldn't suggest this one. The vocals are buried under the mix and while the energy is great, it can wear you out after awhile without the live environment to reenergize you. A true fan should love this, a more casual listener like myself appreciates the power of the live band, but will probably only give this the occasional spin."
4,St. Patrick's Day the way it is!,"It is hard to be more Irish in America than in Boston. Since The Great Hunger, Boston has been an Irish-American city building a unique culture that has enriched both nations. This Boston group as seen in the movies State of Grace and The Departed. This is their house band, playing for them on their special day. You will not find a better selection of songs on a CD or as energetic performance as this. The day, the crowd and the band combine to produce a unique performance that captures the moment and all the excitement it produces.My introduction to Dropkick Murphys is via Flogging Molly and The Pogues, when looking for newer Irish music. While not my pint of Guinness, I recognize their real talent and unique sound. IMO they are more punk than Irish, although you can hear the Irish roots.If you wish to include them in your collection, this is the best CD to have."
2,Dropkick Murphys Album Review,"The product arrived well after the expected date. The album was in fine shape, but my shirt I purchased at the same time came 2 weeks before the CD. Odd and unfortunate. I may not order music or books any time soon from Amazon."
4,good for a couple or a single,Very good material wish it was longer. At first youthink the Rabbi is selling out but when you listenand realize he is talking about this stuff in thecontext of marriage it makes alot of sense. Good helpfor those having trouble if both partners are seriousabout making the marriage work.
5,Fantastic Work available again at last! My fav in the series,"Vaughan's series of books on Valois Burgundy have long been a staple for anyone interested Burgundian history and culture. After a long stretch of being out of print, and very difficult to find, these new editions are sure to be welcomed by many historians. Added to Vaughan's work is a fantastic new introduction written for the 2002 edition by Malcolm Vale (another historian I would readily recommend).While these works may be older, and more recent work has been done on Burgundy, Vaughan's scholarship is still first-rate. A must for the bookshelf of anyone interested in Valois Burgundy, or Northern Europe in the late 14th and 15th centuries."
4,"Good, but...","I've been trying to look for Persian nan, but this is the closest thing to it. The taste and smell of it was really good, and the packaging was alright. I just wish the nan was thicker."
2,Works poorly,"I use this vaporizer in my kids' room when they have a cold or flu by adding the Vicks/Kaz medicine. It takes a long time to release steam and smell the medicine. It also does not go through the water very quickly. I can leave it on constantly for days and the water level will not drop very much. I tried adding salt but it makes little difference, without adding too much. I used to have the larger 1.5 gallon version and it warmed up faster, used up the water quicker, and created a stronger menthol smell (when adding the medicine). I do not think it is a problem with the brand, perhaps just the particular model or even the particular machine. Maybe it is meant to work on a low setting because it is advertised as being used in the nursery--near the baby? I need a second vaporizer to use in my room and I'm really not sure if I want to give this model a second chance or buy the bigger one again."
1,What is going on?,"I'm not sure what is going on. This is the second Vick's steamer I bought this weekend. Neither one of them seemed to work. The first one's light came on when I plugged it in but the water stayed cold and it never did anything. So I took that one back. The second one, which I have now, is plugged in and the water in it has warmed up after being plugged in for over 12 hours, but it also is not doing anything. I don't know what is going on...Aren't these vaporizers supposed to create steam?The water level has not changed. I have even tried adding salt.Can anyone tell me why 2 of these have not worked for me?"
3,Good enough,This vaporizer definetly lets off steam. It gets mighty warm in a small room when this is running. Not sure if it really worked for our kids but good enough for the price we paid.
3,Great for the cost,"This was a very inexpensive product, and it was worth the price paid for it. I purchased this product when my child had a cold. It helped with her cold instantly and helped her to get a good night's sleep.It has worked very well and has worked well for about two years now. Only recently has it started to have problems. Sometimes, in the middle of the night, it will just stop working for seemingly no reason.For $20, though, I'm glad it lasted two years before having issues. I don't mind spending $10/year for something that worked as well on my child's cold symptoms as this did."
4,works great but only a few hours,"We bought two of these...one for the nursery and one for our room. I decided on this one based on several reviews that it would last about 8 hours before needing a refill. For us, that's not even close to what we're getting. It needs to be refilled in about 3 hours for us. Bummer. So I'm back to shopping for something with a bigger capacity. I just want one that lasts through a night of sleeping."
2,Worked great for 3 months,"I didn't want to deal with the hassle of humidifiers & filters so I purchased this low priced vaporizer. It worked great in the bedroom for about 3 months, after that it just didn't steam much."
3,Okay,"Good, basic vaporizor, but don't expect it to significantly increase the humidity in your room. I only get a three percent increase with the doors closed."
4,"Works well, needs to be cleaned often.","At first it seemed to do a great job - strong steam, not too much noise. I use it at night to moisturize the air while I'm sleeping. After several uses, would always be little black particles left behind in the tank. After cleaning the unit, the black particles go away and the steam output improves to its original level of performance. Overall for the price this is a good option and it does the job. I've only had it for four months and I'm not sure how long it would stand up in the long run."
5,Vaporizer,This works very well. Its quiet and only becomes noisy when the water level goes down. Then it starts to gurgle.
5,Twists and turns abound!,"This book grabs your attention from the first page, and keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole way through!!"
4,"Too Short, Make us earn it!","Ok so I am a Patterson addict. But every once in a while you need a new author to break the monotony. The ""new"" Koontz style (Velocity, The Good Guy, The Husband) are very close the the Patterson style with short chapters and an easy read. Also if you havent read The Up And Comer or The Promise of A Lie by Howard Roughan you are missing out. Enjoying Roughans books very much as he is also a coauthor of Pattersons venturing out on his solo career, I gave Gross a shot.The Blue Zone is very good. Being only an inch thick and a quick read is the only disappointment. Dont get me wrong I dont like books that keep you up at night reading useless information, but I prefer a book that doesnt look like a 5th graders class assignment for a book report.The book is good and I hope theres plenty more to come....make it longer and give us more!May Howard and Andrew push out books as fast as James so we have more to read!!!!!DK"
2,The Flat Zone,"If you're into credible plots, realistic dialogue, strong character development, a focused and intense story line, and writing that engenders thought and requires concentration, this is pulp at its worst.If your recreational reading time is limited, and you want to be intrigued from cover to cover, forget this one."
5,Solo works for Gross.,"How would I feel to wake up one day to learn my life was all a federal mess and a huge lie? Kate never gives up. Aside from dealing with Diabetes and a science geek of a job, when Kate's dad is on his way to Prison, and her family into hiding, she puts on a brave face.How could a life that the Feds dictates to your family unravel so quickly? Well, Kate did not know who was who. Her mom had a secret to tell, and on the minute it was about to be passed, that was destroyed as well.The questions kept me at bay until the final pages and a lot of work did not get done because I wanted to see who would live, who would die and who was who. A great first attempt at a Solo Thriller. I hope Andrew Gross has some more for us!"
2,A Disappointment,"I was looking forward to this novel by Gross as I enjoyed ""The Jester"" which he was the co-author of with James Patterson. That said this book is a major disappointment. The main reason is that everything is telegraphed. There are parts of this book where if you can't guess what happens next your not paying any attention to what you're reading. None of the major twists in this book come as a surprise as you see them coming miles (or chapters) away. Let's hope Gross' next solo effort is better and lives up to expectations and is not such a disappointment as ""The Blue Zone"" is."
5,Full thrills and chills - excellent.,"This thriller started a bit slowly, but without much ado we are off on a roll. The story flowed smoothly through all the nooks and cranies leaving doubt until the very end. This is the type of story I just love. Even if I suspect something here or there along the way, I don't find out a whole lot of detail until the end.Loved this one."
5,Fantastic!,"I bought this book outside the hospital gift shop bc I recognized the authors name from his work with my favorite writer, James Patterson. I had not realized that Andrew Gross had a solo book out. Well for a first solo book this book was fantastic. I finished it in less than two days which is saying a lot for a mother of four who also works! The only bad part of the book was it was so good that I couldn't put it down so I was up to late and was so tired the next day!"
5,Thrilling,"This was a wonderfully paced book. It called to be read in one sitting and was much better, in my opinion than any of the more recent Patterson books have been."
5,One of the best ever,"I read a lot of thrillers, mysteries, etc. This book surprised me...the characters were well designed and the twisting plot is just amazing. This will be one of the few books I will keep and re-read."
3,The Blue Zone,"The heroine should have easily been killed, but survived only because she was the central point of the plot. The plot was a bit weak and not too believable."
2,"Read in one sitting, but left unfulfilled","This is a fast, easy read, with just enough good writing to hold your attention...and plenty of undeveloped characters, weak backstory, and unrealistic dialogue to annoy you. After a prologue that basically tells you nothing, the adventure begins. How a lab technician manages to penetrate the Witness Protection Program to find her family is only one of many discrepancies that made me say ""Hello? Can we have a dash of reality here?"" The enigmatic ""fraternidad"" is not given enough weight to justify the rest of the plot. That said, it was the kind of enjoyable book that is good to read while commuting on a train - you don't have to pay much attention, and you won't miss your stop. But then you're going to want to read something more substantial afterwards."
1,"Repetition, repetition,repetition","While the premise is good, the author defuses any suspense by repeating every event over and over. He does not give the reader credit for getting it the first time. The book is a page-turner--I couldn't turn the pages fast enough to finish the damn thing."
3,Compelling Fast Paced Drama,"I found ""The Blue Zone"" to be a very enjoyable book with some great characters. The main character, Kate Raab, is a strong and intelligent woman who keeps the action going. It was frustrating at times, however, how naive she was and some of the bad outcomes were predictable. Fortunately, I read ""Eyes Wide Open"" a year ago so I know that Andrew Gross gets better and more sophisticated as a writer. Despite the criticism mentioned, I found it to be very exciting and there definitely were some surprises."
1,I feel like I've been ripped off,"Go!Go!7188 sounded really cool when I heard them on internet radio, The songs on this cd are pretty cool too. Here's the problem.. THERE'S ONLY 10 MINUTES OF MUSIC ON THIS DISC!! I paid $18.99 for this cd. I can't believe they put as much as much time on the cover art(which is cool) for such a short disc. I'm thinking of starting my own lame band so I can sell $20.00 cd imports over in Japan. Don't waste your money on this one."
3,Sniper Swim Goggle (Amber),"The goggles were great at keeping out the water and didn't fog up. However, the amber color made the beautiful blue water look like deep green (duh! why didn't I think of that before I chose them?) which was not pleasant to swim in and made seeing more difficult. ALSO, the strap was awkward to adjust (but this might have been why it stayed so water tight?)."
5,Best I have found,"I swam four years in high school and of all of the goggles I tried, these consistently fit well, were comfortable, and very rarely had problems staying on off a start.Highly recommended!"
1,Didn't work for me.,"These are the goggles I was looking for, but when they arrived I was disappointed. They fogged up instantly and I adjusted every single position and my eyes felt like they're being sucked out. I gave them to a friend and he gave it to his daughter and they fit perfectly on her. I will still keep searching, for those perfect goggles."
1,"Hurt my eyes, no cushion at all!","I am a Masters swimmer and wanted to try different goggles than TYR femme, etc. I am in need of goggles for a narrow face, thought these might be the ones. They sit straight on the eye socket bone around the eyes and hurt - can't imagine what they would be like in the water when the suction takes hold. Amazon's delivery was practically at my door before I ordered these, outstanding. Unfortunately the product is going back."
3,Lenses shape is funky,"Unless you look straight ahead. It is hard to see out of these google, the angles and curvature do not allow swimmer to use the peripheral vision. That is why is give it a 3 star. They fit well, once they are adjusted."
2,not well done,"These goggles pinch my nose and leak. Though there is a nose adjustment, it just doesn't work well. I've adjusted them to every combination but still they leak and pinch.I doubt that it is due to my being 6'4"", they just seem poorly made."
3,Attic Treasures,"It was written very vaguely and simple.The last story was the only one thatI really enjoyed. It was also a littletoo religious for me and too ""goody-goody""Skurvy"
4,Love this author!,I haven't read it yet so can't give it a 5 but I do like the author & her series of books.
5,Zing case for Samsung,This is a perfect case for the Dell Streak and the Samsung Galaxy note for which I bought it. Its excellent quality. Just make sure its the right size for your needs and you can't do better.
1,need table of contents,"before I buy this book, I need to see the table of contents, could you please provide me the table of contents, Thanks"
1,Shame on you Prentice Hall!,"I would give this book five stars on content. It is very well written and a very good read. However, the printing and binding of this book is abysmal. At forty five dollars and such a small book it was indeed disappointing when the binding started falling apart after less then one month. Prentice Hall needs to look at this book and it's quality control. Until this issue is addressed buyer beware!"
5,"""Practical"" is meaningful in this case!","As opposed to other books with ""practical"" in the title, this one lives up to its name. I found Chapters 4 (Using Files), 5 (The Environment), and 7 (Using Filters) very helpful. The book is full of many examples of practical things, such as how to delete all blank lines in a file. This makes is valuable for the beginner, and the later chapters contain information for the more advanced shell programmer.I got this book at a time when the guy who wrote all our shell scripts quit without notice. This book was a lifesaver, as I had to write short (and not so short) shell scripts to automate certain tasks & understand the work he did.I would like to see more discussion in Chapter 7 (Using Filters) about combining the use of sed and the Unix/Linux command tr. I find that I have to use these together sometimes as one does things the other can't handle. This is the only suggestion I have to improve an already useful book."
5,Lovin the soup!,Gave as an xmas gift to a friend that always orders soup at restaurants. She just loved it! It was perfect. She said the broccli one was amazing.
5,Soups on! Very nice,An adorable array of items - mine was set nicely in the basket. I was happy to give this as a gift.
4,They Love the Soup,"We purchased this Soup Basket for some friends that are always on the go, and find hard to leave work for lunch. They truly enjoy the soup, and she loves the design on the soup cups.Thank you,Happy in Northern California"
1,Not at all what I expected,"For one thing, this was about a month late. It was a shipping issue so I won't count that against the product. The soups that come in the basket, there are 4 of them, are just enough to make 1 cup each! What a rip-off! The presentation is not that great either."
2,Not a good option for Canon Rebel XSI,"This cover is too small for the Canon Rebel XSI (with kit lens). Also, the velcro strips stick to everything, including the neoprene/fabric. Mine came with part of the fabric torn off. I returned it right after I received it."
4,Pay attention to size,"I love the material and style, but for my Canon Rebel XSI the case is almost a little bit too small (even though you can stretch it and try to fit it).The case bottom hardly fits around the camera base. I thought the case had a zipper on the back (no idea why I thought that but it looked like it somehow), but there is only a velcro fastener on the back and even if I pull it down as far as I can, it doesn't completely cover the back of the camera (incl. screen).Overall, I like the product because it's light-weight and great if you don't want to drag along a big camera case or bag."
4,Good product,"I liked this product even though I bought it for a point and shoot Canon S5 and it really didn't fit perfectly. It fits great but there is about and inch and a half left on the front of the lens part, but it's better than anything there is out there for these larger point and shoot digital cameras.The only thing is that the first week of use (and I don't give it that much use) the elastic through which you put the shoulder strap of your camera became loose. I sewed it back up and its working fine, but I didn't really use it that much for it to become unsewn.Good product overall."
4,Wikid hard group,Ok this CD is pretty cool. Songs Like The Red and Comfortable Liar really show some feeling and definately a new and unique sound. I was amazed when I first heard The Red. I played it a number of times and I still enjoy it. I think anyone who likes rock or pop could definately add a little diversity to their collection with this Wikid new band.
5,Chevelle provides top 3 cd for 2002,"This is one of my favorite cd's of 2002. Every song on it has its own appeal and none can be considered ""fillers"". From their debut single ""the red"" (which is impossible to get tired of) Chevelle started getting attention. But I wouldnt rate that in the top three songs on the cd. ""Comfortable Liar"" is one of the cd's best, with the powerful vocals and the extreme bass hits its a cant miss. This cd has a hard sound mixed with great melodies and amazing vocals. The band plays with great emotion, and this should be considered strongly for album of the year!"
4,On the Right Track,"The Amazon reviewer's got a point about lots of modern rock sounding alike... But the almost operatic vocals and intensely personal lyrics (at times sounding like the ranting of someone barely holding their sanity together, at times perfect clarity, it's beautiful) are what make Chevelle truly stand out. I don't know what I expected when I opened the CD, but this picture of three unbelievably ordinary looking guys was a surprise. These brothers make a big noise, you can hear that they've been playing together a long time, and I'm looking forward to more in the vein of ""The Red,"" ""Send the Pain Below,"" ""Comfortable Liar"" and ""Closure."" And that beautiful, beautiful voice. So nice to hear a rocker who doesn't either rap or whine these days! Looking forward to watching Chevelle mature as a band..."
2,eeww...!,"I think I can sum up this review in less than a very short paragraph . This CD is not worth the money, all Chevelle is are wannabe rock stars that have mediocre talent. Perhaps, they will improve in the future. Everytime my brother plays this, I want to rip it out of the CD player and bash it over my knee. I do have a postitve though, and they can write decent lyrics, some actually mean something. But you need to have talented musicians to play the lyrics! Better luck next time Chevelle."
2,too nu metal,"I was first attracted to Chevelle because of how much the song Mia sounded (and the video looked) like Tool. I liked their first album a lot, though it seemed somewhat unpolished. Their new CD, however, seems too ""Nu-Metal"" to me. If you like Trust Company and other bands like that, you'll probably enjoy it."
4,Damn these guys are good,I think this is one of my best music CD's I have. Great songs and the sound is really nice!.
5,Really Outstanding Tracks From An Outstanding Band!!!,"I can't complain much about Chevelle. Actually I can't complain at all! I love their music! This album is probably one of the best even though it came out three years ago. It makes me wish there was more bands that presented such amazing music to the public. Another note, Chevelle also not that famous, but I really really believe they deserve the credit to be. Pick this album up, your money is well spent if you do!!!"
4,Takes a few listens...,"After hearing ""The Red"" and ""Send the Pain Below"" then, hearing that the CD was on sale, I had to get it!But, I was turned off at first as they had more metal influence than I originally thought. But, I stayed with it, and now it's one of my favorite CDs. Even 'acoustic' tracks like ""One Lonely Visitor"" sound good by Chevelle.Strong bass lines and guitar-work help give the songs some variety, noticable in ""An Evening with El Diablo"" and ""Family System"""
2,Ehh,"The only tracks of true quality on this CD are the Red, Send the Pain Below, and An Evening with El Diablo. My advice would be to just download them."
3,Good but not remarkable.,"258 reviews and counting here?! What more can I say that would be helpful at this point? My opinion is that Chevelle does not surpass Taproot or Tool by any means. Taproot and Tool are much better. If you have to compare a band's music and sound to groups that went before it, then chances are they aren't doing a whole lot that's original. Of course that doesn't mean they can't sound good in their own way. And this album does sound good for the most part but in the end it's not remarkable and I don't think I'll be listening to it a whole lot.As for all the sycophantic reviews posted here saying how they are the greatest band on earth, it makes me a bit skeptical. Dig down for the 1 and 3 star reviews to get a more balanced perspective. If you must have the cd buy it used!"
3,Hmmmmmm.........Intresting but yet boring-Ben N.,"This band is an alright band a grade C. band it pulls off ok but i may say that this band is a little bit under mediocre its not as average or as spectacular as everyone might say it is but it does have its moments ""The Red"" is one fo those moments3 Stars"
4,Great Album,This is a great album It has the heavy guitar riffs and the melody. Great vox to. Best tracks IMO:An Evening with El DiabloFamily SystemClosure
3,Choose wisely.,"If you like polished new (not nu-) metal, go with this album, if you prefer down & dirty riffage ala Helmet, go with Point #1 (4 stars)."
4,Chevelle!,"Its a pretty good cd! I heard ""The Red"" on the radio and fell in love with it. I was kind of shocked it was only the three of them,....but they do a great job. This cd can get heavy at times but with songs like ""Closure"", ""The Red"" and ""Forfeit"" the cd is wonderful! ""Forfeit"" would have to be my favorite song on there. Its a great cd to listen to all the way through,....can really get you going!"
5,"Incredible Cd, Incredible Band","A huge step up for Chevelle on this album compared to their last. I found Point#1 to be lacking something that I could not quite figure out until I purchased ""Wonder whats next"". I hear a lot of people saying they sound like Tool because of their first single ""The Red"", but after listening to the entire cd my thoughts changed. This album (in my opinion) is very raw. I found Pete's vocals and guitar work on this album to be a lot more aggressive compared to Point#1. His lyrics I found were much better and just the whole band took a step up from Point#1. As for them being compared to Tool and this album sounding like them, a few songs on the CD do sound like something Tool or A perfect circle would do, but those songs also have their own personality as well. All in all, the latest from Chevelle is a great record and I recommend people to buy this CD."
5,Is there a better live act?,"If you get a chance, check out Chevelle live. They play with such back-breaking intensity, you can't help but tip your cap to them. They played mostly off of Wonder What's Next and This Type of Thinking and simply rocked out. The booming and abrasive tracks of Closure, The Red, and Comfortable Liar were incredible to witness live and make this CD worth purchasing just on their own merit.Chevelle, without question, have the most intense, yet somehow extraordinarily well-coordinated, guitar riffs of any band out there. And better yet, this CD never gets old."
3,Just Okay,"I bought this cd because ""The Red"" is a great song and I was hoping to hear more like it. I was disappointed to not. The Cd was not all that exciting, i listened to it once and put it on the shelf probably not to be heard again."
4,Great Album from a Great Band,"I really like this cd...it is one of the best I have listened to in the past decade. The music is complex, regardless of the lead singer doing both vocals and lead guitar. Chevelle is a great band who have excellent lyrics, and have produced an incredible album racked with emotion. You can hear the soul pouring out in the lyrics. I would like to add that Chevelle should not be placed amoung bands like Slipknot and Mudvayne, as their music is nothing alike those bands who are comprised of angry suburban kids who are mad at the world because they grew up in a middle class home...they have nothing to be angry about...Slipknot and Mudvayne are boy-bands."
5,HEAVY METAL IS BACK!,"This is not your traditional heavy metal music, that CHEVELLE is composing! They have a great new sound! If I had to compare it to something that I have heard before, I would compare it to TOOL'S SOMBER. But really CHEVELLE'S WONDER WHAT'S NEXT has a great new heavy/rock sound of it's own. CHEVELLE is the only band lately, playing true heavy metal music, and I'm not talking about head-bangin stuff, or old-school metal! I'm talking about new modern rock, with a heavy metal blend to it. The tracks I enjoyed were 1-5, and the best songs in my opinion is SEND THE PAIN BELOW, and THE RED. That is not to say the other songs are not good. because the whole thing rocked start to finish. Infact the only thing I disliked, was the acoustic tune at the end! I thought it was a wimpy way to end such a dynamic hard rock effort! That was not enough however, to keep me from rating 5 stars! If you like true heavy metal/hard rock, check out CHEVELLE."
1,THEY ARE NOT CHRISTIAN,"They did an interview back in July on MTV, where they were asked about are they or not Christian. They said they go to church sometimes, but they are defently not a Christian band. They said they rode the Christian band wagon to get famous, just like Evenesence (?). They said this word for word on national televison. I loved them, till they lied. So one star for them cause i use to like them"
4,Sophomore Slump,"A good CD, but not even in a league with the first Chevelle: ""Point #1"". ""Wonder What's Next"" has some great music, but the songs are way to short. When I really start getting into a song, it's over. It is really annoying.""Wonder What's Next"" doesn't even begin to touch ""Point #1"" lyrically. The songs are very simple and very repetitive.Over all this is a good CD, but a huge letdown from the first offering."
4,What? Mainstream rock done well?,"This is one of the few mainstream 'rock' albums that's worth more than it's alloted 'air time'. This happens to be an excellent, in depth, album. My only main critique happens to be that I don't feel they let their songs develop enough before breaking into the main chorus, I just feel that they need to tack on a few extra bars at the begining of some of their songs in order for the 'mood' to be set. But other than that, this band works remarkebly well together and are definitely worth your time."
3,A good start,"After hearing their single ""the red"" and ""Send the pain below"", I figured what the hell, I have some $$ to blow and I bought this album, and it's not a bad start. The things I really like about it are the intelligent lyrics and how every song is different memorable. The bane of this album, however, is the fact that seem to be stuck in the ""three cord syndrome"" in a lot of places, especially in ""comfortable liar."" But there's some great potential here. Best songs are: the red, send the pain below, comfortable liar, don't fake this , title track."
3,Rather good,"I bought this CD after hearing The Red on the radio and then downloading Send the Pain Below - I liked both songs and decided it would be worth it to give this CD a chance. For the most part, it was worth it. My favorite songs are Wonder What's Next - a very heavy almost instrumental song, Don't Fake This, and Forfeit (which I just learned how to play on bass guitar). Overall the CD is pretty good, but not all the songs are worth listening to. by the way, I love the music video for The Red."
5,GREAT ALBUM,"This album I just bought the other day and It's been in my CD player ever since, I usually don't listen to a new CD for over 2 days, I've had it now for 2 weeks, great album! You should buy it if you like hard rock, So go ahead and buy it!"
4,In Their Own Write,"Chevelle isn't exactly copying everything else out there. They don't follow a traditional songwriting structure (verse, chorus, verse...etc) for most of their songs. When I first got the album, I was just expecting every song to come out with a chorus that just blasted me away. But a blasting, catchy chorus is great for a good mood. And Chevelle helps when you're angry."
4,Awesome HARD ROCK,"I became a fan of chevelle when I saw the Point #1 video playing late at night on mtv. I bought their first album and I give it 5 stars although I didnt make a review. They have a hard rock tool like style that displays an awesome talent. If you like Tool give these guys a listen. They have a much ""rougher"" style. I love this album from start to finish, even the live track. I dont think of this album as metal, more like good hard rock."
3,"While good, repetitive","While most of the songs on this CD are pretty good, they all sound the same after a while. I mean, listen to a few of the clips back to back, and you won't know that they're even different songs! However it is a pretty good sound. Get the CD to listen to when you're feelin down and out."
4,"The Red is great, and yet there's better","Wow. When I saw the video ""The Red"" I was busy, and not quite so drawn into Chevelle yet, but when I saw it the second time, I was captured. I don't buy CDs often, because I don't have much money, but after a friend of mine told me he bought it and that it was awesome, I had to. I'm glad I did.I listened to it over and over so many times, every track just pulls me in closer. The only one I dislike is One Lonely Visitor, but hey, one bad song off a CD of 11 tracks is pretty damn good to me.Chevelle put together great lyrics, great music, and great vocals together to create an explosive masterpiece: Wonder What's Next."
1,good question?,"I wouldn't be able to say, I am still waiting on this item to arrive, though I have contacted the seller, and they have assured me it's on it's way, I still haven't received it, it was ordered on Feb. 1st, when and if I receive it, I will let you know what I think. I can tell you it's an excellent CD as I already own it, but it is old and scratched and it skips, so I was wanting to replace it."
2,Nothing new here........,"If your a fan of hard rock/heavy metal your probably gonna like this one. I'm not a fan of it so it just sounds like stupid lyrics and hard guitars. Theres nothing catchy about the songs except of a select few, almost all the songs sound the same,,you can't even hear the lyrics....don't like it."
1,More of the same,"Chevelle's debut album ""Point #1"" wasn't anything to write home about in the least; and ""Wonder What's Next"", the band's sophmore effort, is worse in every way. Much less nu-metal tuned than before, Chevelle seems to be looking for success with the new wave post grunge sensitive hard rock scene a la Nickelback and Staind, and a majority of the time we hear repetitive melodies and whiny lyrics. These days a number of newer bands think the more they whine the more emotional they can be. It's sad how a number of people think bands like Chevelle, along with Staind, Nickelback, Creed, Linkin Park, Trapt, Saliva, and a number of other groups put real emotion into they're music when they don't; and bands who really do like Biohazard, Corrosion of Conformity, and Black Label Society go unnoticed. All in all, this is yet another album best used as a coaster or in a skeet shoot."
4,Hard rock that's pretty good,"Chevelle's second album, Wonder What's Next, is far superior to their first, even though i have never heard their first one. Just a guess. Anyway, Chevelle is a good hard rock band, not perfect, but they're pretty good.Family System- 7/10 DecentComfortable Liar- 9/10 Really goodSend the Pain Below- 8/10 GoodThe Red- 10/10 ExcellentThose are just my favorite songs.If you like hard rock, get it already! By the way, if you don't like what i have to say, i hate you."
4,iidesu ne!,"Absolutely fascinating. Seymour manages to become friends with the most interesting and unorthodox crime group in the world without glorifying them. He meets with all kinds of people in the yakuza, from an Aizu Kotetsu newcomer to a Yamaguchi-gumi oyabun. I read it all in one night. yondekudasai!"
1,Fiction or non-fiction?,"I spent 10 years in Japan between 1983 and 1993 and although I don't claim to have mingled with the Yakuza, I have a hard time believing some of the stories that are spun here. First, I do not believe that a foreigner (American) would gain any significant access to the Yakuza and secondly, the tall tales of gun play are quite ludicrous. Sure, shooting does occasionally happen, but not to the extent that the author ""documents"". As a work of fiction, this may be acceptable, but to call it non-fiction does a disservice to the genre."
3,Action Cover,I was thinking this product would be a little easier to use but getting the camera out of this quick to get a moment shot is pretty hard. Maybe I am just not use to it yet but it does seem to give good protection from dust and debris.
5,Great way to delve into making willow furniture,"Bim Willows ""how to"" book on making willow furniture is a great place for beginners to look for basic information. Easy to follow, concise, with many clear and helpful photographs make this book worthwhile. It has been a lot of fun!"
2,Not mentioned is,"The product is not made out of what it appears and no mention of what it is made out of is mentioned. This could be an issue for animals with skin conditions, or in my pet's particular case, a phobia of crinkly plastic shopping bag sort of noises.I am sure the product would work on either of our other two cats, but it's plastic/poly/mystery construction is something I would have liked to have known before ordering."
2,Too flimsey,"I bought one of these for my Havanese who needed knee surgery. It ended up ""folding back"" so she was wearing it like a cape. If her incision had been on her body, it may still have worked, but it did not stop her from reaching her leg.Something needs to be done to keep the collar from flopping backwards."
2,Not a good collar for cats,"I didn't think before I ordered this that the collar not being clear may be an issue. She's had the collar on for a few days now and she still hasn't gotten her bearings. It completely blocks her peripheral view, so she walks into things and steps on it a lot. Plus, she's gotten out of it twice and reopened her wounds. I ended up ordering a new one that's hard and clear. I recommend the same for anyone thinking of ordering for their cat."
1,Useless for cats and could be dangerous!,"I can't imagine that there is a cat on this planet that couldn't defeat this ""protective"" collar in seconds. It folds down, and as soon as the cat realizes that, they will fold it down themselves! Maybe there are dogs that can't figure it out. It is made out of very cheap noisy opaque plastic (blocks her view completely) and closes with a string (Dangerous for cats!). I tried it out because my cat was getting surgery and I wanted an alternative to the big plastic cones that the Vets use. Well the Vet made a custom made cone for my cat that fit her perfectly. It was made out of a high quality lightweight CLEAR plastic that allows her to see all around. It is cushioned by her neck and closes with strong Velcro. Yes she hates it, but it is safe and it really does the job of protecting her without putting her in danger."
4,Tingly and pretty,"While the lipgloss tingles when it is applied, and it is really pretty, it doesn't plump my lips up all that much. It does give a slight boost though.The warning on the box says not to kiss anyone when wearing it, and it's true! Even 20 minutes after applying, I kissed my husband only to have him complain that his lips burned. So be careful. Also, if you lick your lips after applying the gloss, your tongue will tingle and go slightly numb on the spot that touched the gloss.Even though it doesn't plump my lips dramatically, I would still recommend it for a subtle effect, and good lipstick primer."
4,"Great, diverse, hybrid CD.","Eastern Uprising is a great CD. It's a hybrid of English techno and pop, and Indian classical, folk, and pop music. It's a diverse collection of a bunch of different -- all appealing -- styles of music that reflect the wide array of influences one experiences as an Indian growing up in England. Very good to see something of this artistic caliber being produced!"
5,Awesome!,"This DVD is so cool. Dinosaur George knows a lot about dinosaurs, and he is so funny and smart!"
4,"Funny for kids, hilarious for adults","I've started watching Fresh Prince reruns on TV with my wife since she never got to experience this show when it first aired in the 1990s (she grew up in a developing country). While I liked the show as a kid, I'm loving it as an adult. One of the great things about the show is that it stays PG for the kids, but pushes close to the edge in subtle ways for adults. For example, the show has some goofy moments, which will appeal to kids. However, the show's funniest moments come from the more sophisticated jokes or references to pop culture that kids might not get (such as Will calling Carlton ""Arnold Schwarzen-negro"" right after the latter had pumped iron at the gym). Smith is a genuinely funny actor (in my opinion one of the best actors around), and the rest of the cast is superb. I can't wait for the rest of the series to come out on DVD."
5,Will Smith !!!...'nuff said !!!,"I used to watch this show around 20 yrs ago with my elder brother in my old home after school... God ! Will Smith became an instant idol....He is this country kid who is sent to his aunt's (Bel Air) place by his mother 'coz of him getting into trouble in his hometown Philly.....The guy is truly a ikon and deserves his own show.....The versitality , siulliness, humour and the DANCE.... man ! you will love his dance.... in the few episodes in which he does dance...You gotta love it !!!"
5,Love these dvd's.,I have always loved The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and now I can watch it whenever I want to. I love these dvd's.
1,Louisa may Alcott: A Modern Biography by Martha Saxton,"Having done a good deal of research on Louisa May Alcott, I would call Martha Saxton's work -the soap opera biography. She takes liberties with her source material such as utilizing the freshman english paper style of pulling quotes out of context and with the ever helpful ...uses them to support some National Enquirer type inferences and some pretty out there theories. It makes for a juicy read, but she comes to some highly questionable if not bizarre conclusions. Even the Orchard House, home of the Alcotts, will not sell this book due to the poor scholarship and that should tell you something. Still best biography is Madeleine B. Stern's - thorough, well done and highly recommended over Saxton's questionable attempt."
3,OK... Just Ok.,"Well, the controller set up is just plain awful. Three games played and I just wasn't feeling that new layout so I went back to the old set-up and then this game really becomes fun. One simple fact is that there is too much scoring in this game, even if almost every goal that you score is really cool."
1,EA's Hockey Games Suck!!! Boycott EA!!! Buy NHL 2K7 instead!!!,"This is the worst hockey game that has ever come out. The team rosters are from last year. They had to change the control scheme to confuse everyone. Graphics and gameplay suck!!! When you score a goal in Joe Louis Arena playing as the Detroit Red Wings, the goal horn does not sound like the real thing!!! NHL 2K7 has the real authentic goal horns. Not to mention they say that this game is revolutionary, when in reality, its just like last years game. I suggest a boycott on all Electronic Arts Games and support 2K Sports, as they have the most realistic sports games on the market at a cheaper price!!! Don't buy NHL 07, its a waste of money!!!"
3,NHL 07,"I am an avid game play and I just wish that EA Sports would make a more realistic hockey game. Simply, lower scoring and good goaltending!"
4,More effort next year please..,The new controller lay out takes some getting used but once mastered goes easily.Overall the game is a blast. However there are some areas within the game that seemed rushed. Lack of updated photos of players within the game. As far as I can tell they are the same photos from the NHL '06 game. Also I have noticed a couple of times when showing the bench during the game there is some interference in the back ground.Even that is not enough to deter me from playing it daily. My recommendation is buy and enjoy!
1,Don't buy this game.,"Mostly the same game as NHL 06, but they screwed with the controls and I didn't like the play. Don't buy this game."
5,An excellent double cd,"Having bought the original Vicious But Fair LP I am very impressed with the cd edition. While there is a different flow to both albums I think it works fine in this format. This cd rocks. The songs are solid, the band rocks, and Chapman's voice is in fine form! A must for any Chapman fan."
2,Interesting History,"I wasn't a member of the church during this incident and I initially picked up this book so I could learn a little more about the events of the time. She seems to have a hard time separating the individual events, personalities, and weaknesses that she encountered from the general teachings of the church. She also seems to be a complainer in some respects and I just didn't feel that I could trust her version of events because they were so different from my experience with the church."
1,WATER BLASTER JR. WATER CANNN,"IF YOU ARE GOING TO USE THIS IN A SWIMMING POOL, IT WILL PROBABLY BE FINE. THE WATER BLASTER JR. LEAKS PRETTY BADLY BUT IT WOULDN'T MATTER IN A POOL. YOU HAVE TO REFILL IT AFTER 2 OR 3 BLASTS. AGAIN, VERY CONVENIENT AS A POOL TOY. IF YOU ARE BUYING IT TO SIT ON YOUR PORCH AND SCARE CATS AWAY FROM YOUR BIRD FEEDERS LIKE ME, I'D MAKE ANOTHER SELECTION."
3,Ignore review that says Region B,"This disc arrived with no markings to denote Region B status, played just fine in my region A PS3, and has the NTSC (vs PAL) format logo on the package and disc. As for the disc and sound, it is in stereo and pretty much what you'd expect from Neil and CH. Interesting interpretations. I'm not a huge fan, but I want to support Blu-Audio and Hi-Def music."
2,phooey,I was all set to buy it and then I listened to the free tracks....I'll buy his early stuff. Being 61 years old I love the old stuff
1,Yuck yuck yuck,"Oh, what a stinker of a book! Luckily, I got it as a present and didn't squander my valuable cash. This is a classic example of the worst stereotypes of Africa. Africa is a desert. Africa is full of Animals. Africa is deadly. Africans run around naked. Heck, Ritts' presentation of Africans is EXACTLY THE SAME as his presentation of animals. Whether accidental or intentional, it is insulting all the same. SHAME SHAME SHAME.Strangly, I have found this to be a USEFUL book. I use it as an example during my lecture on ""Stereotypical Images of Africa"" in my African History Class. Without this redeeming feature, I would probably use it as a backstop on the rifle range."
5,Easy to read with practical steps that work. It's the best.,"The strongest recommendation that I can give Donna's book is that it's never in my bookcase, but always on loan to someone in the midst of career transition, personal re-evaluation or eager to improve their networking skills. I have given this book to a number of friends and family members as a gift because I have seen that following the principles Donna presents works in the real world."
2,"So few real ""secrets""","I'm shocked at the wealth of positive reviews for this book. It doesn't supply secrets, it just provides flowery arguments for the reasons why to network.We all know it is important to network- that's why would have bought the book in the first place. Its lack of useful advice or specific tactics was disappointing.I expect to see Donna Fisher in informericals."
5,Excellent book on creating relationships,"This is the best book I have read on the subject of networking. It focuses on the aspect of ""giving"" information to the people you network with rather than ""getting"" something from them. We would all be much better off if everyone practiced just a few of the techniques that the author shares. I plan on incorporating most of the 55 practical tips right away. The book is a fast-read and is very helpful if you want to connect with people for any purpose, whether it be for your career or for social reasons."
2,Well dark is one way to say it.,"This book was a very organized. That is one of the few things it had going for it. The problem I found was the added zodiac, and the fact that it had no real place. There wasn't even enough information to tell you about what time of year it was. And where did the information about this New zodiac ""Arachne"" come from. There was good information on the Dark aspects of the moon, But is still can't grasp Arachne and when exactly this happens. My advice is to take it with a grain of salt and enjoy some tidbits"
4,Rethinking the 3 Laws and the value of work,"This is a murder mystery, as Many of Assimov's books were, but this takes on important new levels. An in depth look at the famous 3 laws from the perspective of what it does to the society attitudes and pyschology. It talks about change, risk and spends time focusing on what some of the robots think, especially the radical new robot Caliban. It speculates on what what slave owners might have thought about the propoerty that dearly depended on, and reminds us that what we do everyday can matter, at least to ourselves. The ending of the mystery was a little to convienient, that is why only 4 stars."
4,A really good book.,"Very entertaining, very interesting look at the only Spacer world with a crime rate, and the strange happenings revolving around a robot with no Laws. I pictured the main human character chick as Sandra Bullock in my head. Anybody got any other suggestions?"
5,I love these bags!,"I purchased these bags for myself when my son was born and I have loved them ever since! I attach the roll to the zipper on our diaper bag which is very convenient. I have used them for diapers when we are away from home (away from a garbage can, or at a friend's house) and also for dirty or wet clothes. The bags pull out easily and you just tear off at the perforation. There is a slight scent to the bag also, though not the 'powder' scent like other bags. I like that I can just toss them when the bags run out, and I don't have to worry about not finding refills, etc. I give them out to all my friends who have babies! Highly recommended!"
3,Sunshine Kids Bag It,Such a good product to have attached to your diaper bag. The product description says it brings 3 dispensers per retail package; except I only got two dispensers with my purchase. I am disappointed that i was mislead by the advertisement.
5,Devastating Beauty,"There are some authors who, when you read them, can crush your confidence in your own writing. They are so perfectly in control of their craft, their prose so utterly devastating in its perfect beauty, that you put down the book and say, ""Well, crap. I'll never be THAT good."" Will Christopher Baer is one such author.That his prose is not only beautiful, but can also be dark, witty, and down right violent, only heightens the pleasure for me.There are sentences in this collection that will make a fellow writer stop to catch their breath. It's the equivalent of going to MoMA and standing in front of a masterpiece.I await Godspeed with the utmost of anticipation."
5,The First Book,"Phineas Poe keeps losing things. His kidney. His wife. His way. But, not his hope. In a downward spiral of language and plotting that combines the senses and rhythym of Thomas Cook, James Crumley, and Jack Kerouac, Poe confirms that love is the bottom line in a final sentence that several years after I first read it still has the power to force open a bottle of scotch and drive me to this entry.I haven't read the rest. The rest will follow. Like Phineas, I know better than to count on more than what is in front of me. What is here is enough to comprehend."
3,"Decent, entertaining, but","As the back cover of the book states, these three novels read like a feverish dream. The writing doesn't include typical grammar structure like quotation marks but instead flows very smoothly as if from another world. There is rampant drug/alcohol usage which sometimes makes things seem a little depressing, but otherwise the stories are entertaining.Overall, the book is an easy read. It's entertaining but not altogether fulfilling. Hell's Half Acre was probably the best, mainly because it made some sort of sense. The characters from the first two novels didn't really seem to be based in any kind of coherent reality.Just my .02. I walked away after finishing the book saying ""What was the point?"""
3,OK but...,"One of the worthwhile things about this book, which serves as a pretty decent introduction to financial statements, is its treatment of the DIFFERENT types of statements for retailers/manufacturers, banks and utilities. I'm not aware of any other book for beginners which offers guidance towards the distinction between the three. But since the author took the trouble to detail these, one wonders why he didn't also discuss insurance companies as a separate entity, especially since utilities have offered less capital appreciation potential to investors in recent years."
3,"Good overview, a bit sloppy","A good overview of walking through a standard financial statement. Covers the balance sheet, statement of income, and statement of cash flows, along with some analysis and specifics on banks and utilities.My big gripe? It has a model spreadsheet at the back that you can use to help do your own analysis, but I found several typos in the formulas. A gripe that makes this less than a perfect book."
5,Masterpiece,"One of my favorite books of all time and one of the very first novels to deal with an environmental issue. What environmental issue? Saving a bog, a piece of ground that many would consider of little use or beauty. But a young man in Ireland in the last quarter or so of the 19th Century sees all its beauty and loves the bog, which is about to be torn up for development. What can save it? His only allies seem to be the young woman he loves, an Irish fighter who once seriously considered shooting him, a wise woman living on the edge of the bog and her very wise but unlettered son. The story takes one just to the edge of Irish myth. It concerns love, forgiveness and the wonder of the world.Highly recommended."
4,Love-Hate Relationship,Strenghts: Quite readable considering the subject. Terms are laid out in bold face and concepts are explained in identifiable sections. The summary at the end reinforces concepts and key terms. The end of chapter questions give you something to think about. Most examples are easy to follow. Weaknesses: Some concepts that include examples are explained with formulas in parentheses so that you have to stop reading and look at the figure. Not bad but I like them in the figure or in footnotes. Some of the exercises/problems were difficult to relate to the examples in the book. Other than that this book is great. What would make this book a 5? The study guide.
2,Cost Accounting: A Managerial Emphasis,We use this text in 2nd year accounting in Australia. I find it very difficult to understand. The explanations are too technical with unnecessarily long words. The examples don't correspond to the questions. Also there are several obvious spelling errors.
3,"Good definitions, bad examples.","I find this book very difficult to understand. Too often, there are formulas written right into sentences, and not in any special order. I would much prefer that the definition for a particular term is given in a sentence, then have the formula off to the right, or in the middle of the page, separated from the definition. This book gives very good definitions of terms, but very poor examples of the exercises that are given in the back of the chapters for review. In the chapter, there is maybe one type of problem, yet in the back of the chapter, 10 different problems too different from the given example."
2,A lot of environmental sermonizing.,"Most of the fiction I've read lately has the same theme: mankind is evil because we're destroying the environment. Earth worshipping tribes are wiser, kinder and more deserving than the rest of humanity. This book adds a twist but sermonizes in similar vein. It is filled with characters who are at least amoral and frequently monstrous. I long for the days when fiction was entertainment and you always knew who the good guy was. Apparently, that kind of book is doomed to extinction."
2,Great Idea but Poor Execution,"This book started off very well, but the story really lost steam about the halfway point. Robinson's story is that there's another, secret, competing race of humans that live among us and are healthier, more peaceful, stronger, etc. When his characters accidentally stumble onto this fact, it sets in motion a chain of events that start off exciting, but gradually become very repetitive, with the book ultimately falling apart, due to one coincidence too many (I don't want to give too much away here and risk ruining the book for you). Ultimately, what started as a riveting page-turner for me, turned into a book that I felt I had to finish, since I'd devoted so much time to it already. Very disappointing."
3,Conspiracy theory meets Anthropology 201,"I was pulled into this science thriller by the murder of a doctor. Mr. Robinson moved the story along but then the bottom fell out. It became too talky with long and drawn out monologues by the central characters. Still, it had its moments but I figured it out with 60 pages to go. It was a decent read."
2,Better as a Guide to San Francisco than a thriller,"You know, I spent a lot of time Waiting, too...waiting for the plot to get interesting, waiting for the science to make sense, waiting to warm up to the characters...Sorry, but Mr. Robinson's WAITING just kept me holding too long. I will say that he has a wonderful way of describing San Francisco -- from the alleys of the Tenderloin to Golden Gate Park."
2,Riveting piffle,"I am embarassed that I finished this book; it is my dirty little secret. Most of the reviewers got it right...heavy handed, predictable, not well thought-out. It moves along, to be sure. But so does a train before it crashes."
2,Good Idea; bad execution.,"For an experienced and well-published author, Robinson makes a surprising number of amateurish errors; perhaps the most egregious is the overwhelming amount of narrative and the paucity of dialogue. When a character asks a question and the answer doesn't arrive until three or four hundred words later, the reader is forced to either rely on memory, go back and look up the question, or say to hell with it. Another turn-off appears early when the protagonist--a professional man--has a panic attack, then blunders around San Francisco doing all the wrong things. A better editor could have saved this book, for it does have some good scary things in it."
3,A Pyschological Thriller,"The journey Robinson takes us on is an endless flight. Some how the tale seems very farfetched, but somewhere, somehow it starts to contain a disconcerting logic. The truth of how a high school character will change no matter how beautiful, talented, or smart is shocking. For a person of seventeen it makes me question what my future will be when I'm forty. Waiting does keep you ""waiting"" for the next twist and turn towards the line of reality and non-reality."
5,Wonderfully spooky!,This book will really make you wonder the human species and their origins. This is a must-read in my opinion!
3,Doesn't live up to the hype...,"A decent story, but the book does not live up to the hype. The story premise was interesting, but the book fell short in delivering what could have been an excellent novel. While the book had its good points, some of the character building information tended to bog the story down instead of enhance it. An average book in my opinion. (unabridged audiobook version)"
3,not enough real science to be called science fiction,"I had high expectations for this book, but found it to be repetetive, lacking good characters and just not enough science. The premise for the existence of the ""old people"" was flimsy at best. Much of the book was over-explaining how it could happen - with no scientific proof, just some wild speculation. It wasn't all bad though - it was exciting, scary and had some interesting plot twists. I think it could make a great thriller-type movie if someone turned it into a screen play and put a good actor as lead. In the book, I really didn't care at all about any of the characters ... and that makes it a little slow."
3,I'm not sure why I liked this book...,"...but I did. The author does a fine job of reeling you in while providing just enough details about the Others. I'm a long-time reader of SF and related genres, and I found some original and intriguing plot twists."
1,I've read a lot of good books latey. Not this one.,"As an example, let me point you to page 162, where the ""hero"", Artie, whips out his cigarette lighter to see his way up a dark staircase. Convenient, but not how you think. This is a character that doesn't smoke! Not before this scene, and not after. Ever. Beyond that, ""Waiting"" is not spooky, is burdened by ""filler"" that adds nothing to the book, and is a book I had to struggle through. It's one I will throw away rather than give to anyone. I can't waste their time, and am sorry I wasted mine."
2,Could Have Been More...,"This book received so much positive hype, that I couldn't wait to read it. Alas, the story never lived up to its potential. The characters were FLAT, and the story uneven. I kept reading because the concept was exciting and I kept thinking: ""this is going to pick up and all gel soon."" It never did. The worst part was the constant thought I had while reading it that it could have been an outstanding reading experiece if someone like Koontz got hold of it! It wasn't a complete waste of time since I read it on a flight from Ft. Lauderdale to Phoenix, but I had hoped for more. I did enjoy Robinson's THE POWER however. Check that one out."
1,Premise with potential nullified by clichés,"This book was mentioned in Stephen King's reading list (as an appendix to his inspirational ""On Writing""). The premise of a race of ""superior"" beings living among us intrigued me. Unfortunately, that was the ONLY reason why I endured the book until the end. I couldn't care less about any of the two-dimensional characters, the corny dialogue, or the repetitious spoon-feeding of plot detail (how stupid is the reader expected to be?). I sped through most of the novel because I was anxious to put it away and move on to a better book. VERY disappointing."
4,Entertaining & Refreshing,"Carribean Crusing is the story of 18 year old Lindsay, and her quest to complete items on a list while on her Carribean Cruise for the summer to celebrate her mom's wedding.Some of the items on the list include getting drunk, snokeling, kissing a lot of cute guys, and ending with the big one: sleeping with a guy for the 1st time.Along the cruise, Lindsay goes on a quest for the right guy to complete the final task with, enlisting help from friend Brooke. This book was a page-turner, funny, and described teen life in a good way. This was a fun story for the summer which girls should take time to read!"
2,Only appropriate for older teens...,"My younger teenage daughter bought this book, then tossed it aside after reading a couple of chapters. I picked it up to check it out and realized why. It is a well written and engaging book. But - there is underage drinking and the main character is out to loose her virginity to someone while on a cruise to get it over with. I think any moms looking at reviews should know this!"
4,Romantic and Fun,"A perfect book for those who enjoy teen romance novels. It tells the story of Lindsay, a teenager looking for love. If you want a detailed plot, read the summeries below this. I've only read the first half, so I actually don't know what happens in the end. However, I can tell that it's a fun book.This is not quality literature; not a book that makes you think. Instead, it's a fun, light, almost fluffy book. It's quick-paced and enjoyable. As a teenager, I find myself relating to many of the emotions and feelings that Lindsay feels. The characters are fairly believable, and it's an enjoyable adventure.Although I wouldn't reccomend this as an amazing, quality piece of literature, I'd definately reccomend this to someone who wants to enjoy a book again. It's fun and light, and truely enjoyable!! A perfect light read."
4,"Great story, though not much of a problem","This story is about this girl named Lindsay who goes on a cruise with her parents' honeymoon. She left her best friend, Julie behind, and met another girl, Brooke on the ship- The Enchantment. There, they meet a whole bunch of guys, but none of them is perfect for Lindsay's idea of a ""summer fling"" However, her stepdad has had this really hot guy named Ryan to look after her, but she doesn't want to be babysat. So... the whole book is basically their adventures and Lindsay looking for a perfect guy. Really easy to read, and really good!"
2,NOT by Rachel Hawthorne. Read copyright notice.,"I am generally a big fan of Rachel Hawthorne. However, this book does not thrill me. Lindsay is not only predictable, but clearly lacks all common sense (who wants a fling with someone ""special"" anyway? A fling is a fling. Either you want special, or you want a fling. Who seriously expects to find both, and in only ten days?). Brooke is annoying, and hanging out with her for so long only stresses that Lindsay lacks common sense. Ryan, also predictable.The grammar and wording is also odd at places; this author doesn't seem to like commas. It's like this book is written by a completely different person. Which brings me to another point - Who is Jan Nowasky anyway, it says by Rachel Hawthorne on the cover, but copyright belongs to a different person. Other books I've read, copyright belongs to Hawthorne.I recommend Hawthorne's other books, like ""Island Girls and Boys"" ""Thrill Ride"" or ""Love on the Lifts"" but don't waste your time with this one."
3,Fun but easy read,"Classic teen book, makes you smile, easy read. Fun way to spend a quiet day, won't disappoint that's for sure!"
4,Vacation for your mind!,"I wanted a fun read about vacation, and that's exactly what this book gave me! The main character was obviously immature, but she's supposed to be; she is 18 and just graduated from high school. If you're searching for a light, summer-y read, then this book will likely entertain you.I took one star away for the ending. I feel like the author ended the book too abruptly when there were more plot lines to wrap up. I read the last sentence of the book and didn't even realize it. I turned the page on my kindle and only then realized the story had ended!"
4,Overall decent book,"I was pleasantly surprised with this book. From the synopsis, I thought it would be cheesy, predictable, and boring. It is cheesy and predictable, but in a quick-read, great for the beach sort of way. The plot is light and consists of a typical girl eighteen year old girl, Lindsay, trying to have a good time on vacation. Enter Ryan, Lindsay's soon-to-be stepfather's godson. Lindsay initially describes him as cute, but is afraid he will ""cramp her style"" when she finds out he is only tagging along to babysit her. Will Lindsay find a way to ditch him and have the cruise of a lifetime? Warm up and find out with this summer read."
5,A Must Read Book!,I absolutely loved this book! If you are looking for a good summer read this is the book!! Once you pick it up you can't put it down. I'm hoping for a sequel!
4,Very Discriptive,"This story is the typical teenage romance novel with the girl, her best friend, and the boy she wants but can't have. The thing that made this story great was the awesome decriptions of the beautiful tropical scenes. This book is very picturesque and creates great mental images. It made me want to go on my own Caribbean Cruise!"
3,an okay book,"I read this book after i read Love on the Lifts. And that was a hard book to top. So this book might have been more appealing to me if i had read it first. It's my least favorite Rachel Hawthorne book. But I love all of them. Overall its an okay, easy-read, book."
4,Carribean Crusing,MY book was about a girl Lindsey. Her mom was marrying a millionaire on a cruise ship. Her best friend couldnt go with her so she got a new friend Brook that she met on the cruise ship. Her moms new Husband invited his nephew to come. She and his nephew ended up falling in love.
5,Mission Book,This was a present for my daughter and she was very pleased with the quality of the book
1,No color,No color and too much text for meI have seen better and would have not purchased ifI saw it in person
5,great,"this is one of those cds you can listen to over and over. my favorite tracks are #'s 2,3,4,5. anyone from atlanta should cop this!"
4,Med socks,"Great socks, with excellent gripper stripes on the bottom. A little inconsistent on a few of the pairs, but am generally pleased with them. Had a slight problem with shipping, but they corrected it."
2,Not for size 11 and up!,These seem fine but they are NOT one size fits all. My husband is a 12 and they are too small.
2,Not for men's sizes,I was very disappointed with the size which works out to be more like ankle socks for me (men's size 10.5). I find myself having to keep pulling them up to be comfortable. The low height does not keep me as warm as I would prefer. Definitely not the size you see on the picture (which has the sock almost up to the calf). What you see if definitely NOT what you get. The picture must have been taken with a child wearing it. Too bad...cause the fabric quality seems good. I'm going to have to keep them anyway as paying for return shipping would cost as much as the product did.
1,Disappointed,"These socks cannot be found in any store anymore. I bought these online because they looked just like the old tube socks with rubber on the bottom for a non-slip grip. The ad online said, ""one size fits all."" However, when received and given to my adult sister as a Christmas gift, we found that they are are almost a kid's size sock. The rubber on the bottom doesn't quite go to the heel of the sock, and the top of the sock barely came up above the ankle. We had our 12 yr old niece try them on and they fit everywhere just perfect. The heel hit the right place and they came up higher than the ankle. I would not buy these again because ""one size fits all"" is not true."
4,Nice Product...,"The fit is great. I am 5'7 and have big feet (women's size 11) and the socks go to mid-calf. I am ALWAYS cold and these socks warm me up.The downside: the ""no-slip"" bottoms don't work. I was expecting them to be similar to hospital socks, but they are okay."
5,Terrific when you need them!,"We have tile floors AND Ive been in and out of the hospital for a while so these have been doing double duty. The rubber on bottom is a very good safety feature and for the price an excellent value. They are mid-calf so they are not real warm but they are ""fuzzy"" socks so they help."
2,Uncomfortable,"The toe seam on these socks is incredibly uncomfortable. They are warm, though, which is why I didn't totally berate the product. I actually bought these for my hospital stay when I gave birth and never used them in the hospital. I have used them at home since, though, and only wear them when it's absolutely necessary due to the annoying toe seam. They are always successful in warming my frigid tootsies, though!"
1,What am I missing?,"$3.60 to buy and $7.74 to ship so the price is really $11.34 for a pair. Seems excessive, am I missing something?"
1,not as pictured,Buyer beware!!!!!!!!!! This company decieves its buyers by showing picture of wrong item! This item is in fact a little jewelry kit not the rock tumbler that is pictured!
1,Douglas Reed,"i would rather read the ""controversy of Zion"" written by Douglas Reed. This book is somewhat banned because it exposes the truth.Geoffrey Wheatcroft in my opinion is pro-Zionist and his book serves only to soften the edges of zionism, an ideology found by many to be worst than apartheid."
3,Would rate five stars if...,"All seven DVD's in the collection have been recorded in the DVD-R format. Most unusual and very inconvenient because only acomputer or a DVD player designated DVD-R-RW can play these otherwise excellent episodes. The original U.K. episodes are muchbetter than the ""americanized"" version. It's too bad we can't get the complete British collection, they were a gem. The delivery was much faster than promised. Would have been nice to know these DVD's are in the R format before ordering. Thecontent is excellent for showing students what problem solving skills are all about. Motivates the students to get away fromthe computer and start thinking with their heads and working with their hands."
2,All right,"Would not recommend purchasing this item. It is as described.. however, picture very misleading. This watch is army GREEN. You can buy a lot better watch for the money"
2,Battery did not eve last 1 year!,Battery simply died even before 1 year after the purchase. not sure whether it's been sitting on the shelf for too long...
1,Nike-WK0008301,Never received this item. Did not have enough money on my credit card for this purchase.
4,Baking Time,"This colorful book is a fascinating aid to those cooks who enjoy creating special scenes with their baking. Gingerbread lends itself to all sorts of creative ideas, and this book will get you started by providing you some great ideas."
2,Some unique ideas but not enough instructions,"There are some unique ideas which made the purchase worthwhile. However, the instructions are not very thorough. I also felt that many of the houses could have been more attractive. Some of them were quite ""messy"". I was also disappointed that there were not any sources listed."
2,Really disappointing,"If you are seeking the inside secrets to gingerbread artistry, don't expect much from this book. This book doesn't even begin to cover the many gingerbread/food techniques currently available -- and that home builders can use -- which mimic real-life or fantasy -- building structures and contents. I thought that many of the instructions shown were too simple and general -- the reader deserved to read more details, more inside information on how to work with food items to create effects -- especially since the author is a pastry chef! The book's description also promises photos of the Grove Park Inn's gingerbread competition entries. But if you expect to see the competition's top of the line entries featuring incredible details, don't. I looked forward to receiving this book. I'm sorry I bought it."
4,Inspiring...,"...but thats about it. I agree with previous reviews. As a veteran of Gingerbread I have been making houses for several years. I bought this book primarily for the pictures, which was pretty much all I got. This book is for experts in gingerbread to provide inspiration and new ingredient ideas. Those looking for a place to start should look elsewhere."
3,I'll keep it but only as a supplement to better books,"This book has pictures of some really cool ideas, and pictures of some less-cool ideas. It also has several basic recipes and some general building information, but it isn't very detailed. Most frustrating are the pictures of houses that have only one or two pictures and little or no information about some of the most interesting design details!If I hadn't purchased this book from an independent bookseller, I'd probably return it. It is useful to a beginner like me, but only marginally."
5,IF YOU LIKE G-SHOCKS,THIS IS A GREAT TOUGH WATCH!! WHAT I LIKE MOST ON THIS ONE AS OPPOSED TO OTHER DW5600E MODELS ARE THE RED LETTERING AS OPPOSED TO WHITE OR GOLD ON OTHERS AND MOST IMPORTANT THE STRAP IS A VELCRO AND NYLON STRAP WITH A LOCKING PUSHBUTTON SNAPBUCKLE AS OPPOSED TO A RESIN STRAP (WHICH ON ME TEND TO CRACK AND BREAK AT THE MOST INOPERTUNE TIMES)iT'S SORT OF LIKE A NATO G-10 IN DURABILTY.
5,Great! My 10 month old loves this book.,"He simply can't get enough. Too bad it's only about 10 pages long. We also have the ""Who's Daddy Does This"" book and he enjoys that as well."
4,Who's in the Sea?(Sliding Surprise Books),Great books that my children have all loved! The only complaint I would have is after a while they fall apart or the kids are too rough with them and they tear them apart.
4,"a great story, but HORRIBLE binding","I'll start with the few bad parts of Outlander. This graphic novel has such horrible binding that the first time I read it (and I take VERY good care of my TPB's) it fell apart in my hands. Darkhorse really needs to do something about this, as this is the second graphic novel that has fallen apart.This TPB was very good in terms of its storyline, though. Ki-Adi-Mundi is sent to Tatooine to find out what happened to Sharad Hett, a Jedi who left the Order years ago. Hett was seen on Tatooine leading the Tusken Raiders in battle against the settlers. Ki-Adi-Mundi goes to find out what went wrong with Hett.The art of Outlander was above average, as Ki-Adi-Mundi looked really weird in every picture. The story and dialogue was very good, which saved it from getting a 1 (because of the binding).Still, Outlander was a very good read. Just make sure you have some super glue handy while reading it."
4,"Nice little case, great size........","I didn't want a big old case and this thing fits my needs great. Don't have to worry about setting the camera down gently and worrying about it getting scratched all the time. That was my main concern. I'd recommend it. I wish I bought directly from amazon though. Bought from adorama and they used a shipper that held onto it for a week at a warehouse 600 miles from me. Took over two weeks total. They were great when I bought my camera direct on their site,just not this time. But this case fits my rebel xs perfect. Only complaint is getting it in and out is a little hard. but it also stays in there well. I'd buy again."
4,Convenient camera case!!,"I relly like the Zing. I wanted a camera cover that would travel well and protect my camera without the bulk. It definitely protects the camera but does not take up a lot of room in my backpack or my suitcase. I feel confident in the amount of camera protection that it provides. I wish it has one pocket for my extra sd card but that is a small price to pay. What I love most about the Zing is that it attaches to my camera strap so when I take it off to take a picture, I don't have to have an extra hand to hold the camera bag, it just hangs on the strap. The only down side is that it takes me a few minutes to figure out how to put the camera back in that bag, but I just need practice!!"
5,Love it!,"This fits my Nikon D3000 perfectly with the kit lens. I don't have a zoom lens yet, so I'm not sure if it will squeeze in there or not. This is great for throwing my camera in my purse and not having to drag around my separate case. It secures the camera, but is still easy to get it out to take a quick shot. Highly recommend!"
2,"does not fit 4"" lense like it says","Simply does not fit my slr with a 4"" lense. Product description states ""fits autofocus SLR cameras and other large cameras with a lens up to 4 inches."" I measured my lense and it's exactly 4"" (18-135mm) and it's not even close to fitting. I tugged and pulled and tried to stretch out the material,.. and if I had pulled it around the lense it would have taken a lot of effort and stretching of the material, and would have put a ton of pressure on the lens. I was afraid that the dramatic pressure (if I did fit it on) would eventually damage the lens. I'll have to return the item and get a different one, but I'm hoping they send the new one without extra shipping charges (since the original one had free super saver shipping because I bought other items with it to get the free shipping). I gave this 2 stars because I think if it actually fit, it would be useful. I seriousely don't even think it would safely fit with a 3.5"" lense."
4,it fits!,"I wasn't sure which size to buy, but this fits my nikon d60 with an 18-55 lens and will stretch to fit my 55-200 lens as well."
1,Doesn't fit on a Canon T1i with 18-55 standard lens.,"I bought this for my new Canon T1i with the standard EF-S 18-55mm lense attached. Simply stated; it doesnt fit.I would have had to stretch the piece that loops back up over the lense far past it's thread limits to get it on, and if i did... I dunno if i would have been able to remove it at all.I think it is a great idea, I am very dissappointed that i couldnt make it work. I gave it only one star because i had to send it back, never got to use it."
5,"My Canon T2i, never leaves home without it","This is one of the most important pieces of camera equipment I own. It fits my T2i with room to spare, and it protects it from dust and unexpected weather."
4,Handy product,"The Zing covers are handy for transporting SLRs without the typically bulky cases. Obviously they will afford less protection than fully padded cases or bags, but if you prefer a compact package this is the way to go. Keep in mind that even the large size will barely fit over a larger digital SLR such as the Nikon D90 with 18-105 mm lens."
3,Didn't work for me,I bought this to use with my Nikon D90 and 35mm lens for a trip to Europe. I found the cover well made but very cumbersome to use. It is hard to open and close and just didn't work well for me. I ended up buying a Lowepro Adventura 140 which fit the bill. Perhaps you will have better luck with this as long as you are not in a hurry to get your camera out for quick shots.
4,RAT-A-TAT-TAT...I really enjoyed this book,"I really enjoyed this book. I did not really know much about the St. Valentine's Day Massacre other than what I have read on the web and as a chapter or section of other books. I enjoyed this as it is not only well written and documented, but it gives a complete background as to why, how and who. I srongly recommend this to any student of Chicago Gangster History."
5,Definitive DVD on the Battle of Franklin,"Wide Awake's The Battle of Franklin is their best documentary yet. Wonderfully edited, the dvd details the botched Confederate opportunity at Spring Hill which led the Army of Tennessee into virtual slaughter in Franklin. Touching are the little told and tragic tales of General Patrick Cleburne, cut down by a Federal bullet as he charged into the fray, and Tod Carter who was mortally wounded within sight of his home. The imagery and first hand accounts bring to life the ill-fated battle, the men who fought it and the citizens who weathered it.Debra Glass co author ofSkeletons Of The Civil War - True Ghost Stories of the Army of Tennesseealso available on Amazon.com."
2,Very Vague... Uninterresting,"This is a rather badly written book. I don't know what the reviews mean by saying it was a readble book... I found it confusing and the language used is unnecissarily vague. Like someone had commented. The authors tend to use ""obviously"" ""clearly"" etc way too much, especially when the subject is unclear and unobvious. The pseudocode is probably the most annoying part of it. I think thats why lecturers prefer giving their students this book, as they can easily set excercises without having to worry about students looking to the book for answers. I don't recommend this book for people new to the subject. If you already know the subject well, and want to reinforce your understanding, then its a very good book. But if you're new to the topic, just read the first chapter and you'll know this book is not for you..."
1,Book review,"This is not a good beginning Java programming book. It is better for problem solving, but I wish all the concepts covered would have contained Java code."
5,What a Voice!!!!,"This is probably one of my favorite CD's. Eddie Reed is the son of an opera singer and has the voice to show for it. The CD is a remake of old standards from the 1930's with crisp instrumentation. The range is that of a baritone, so it is easy to sing a long with. Fairly up-tempo songs throughout. Anyone who likes modern swing or classic big band HAS to own this one."
4,documental serio,"Este documental enfrenta seriamente las cuestiones planteadas por la revolución Sandinista. Hay metraje evocativo de varias etapas del proceso, desde la dictadura de los Somoza hasta la derrota electoral del FSLN, y también de muchos protagonistas de a través de la gama politica. Para los cuyas vidas rozaron con aquellos acontecimientos, debería desatar muchas memorias."
4,Great buy,My daughter is intrigued by the touch and feel of the objects inside the book. The only improvement I would suggest is to provide more touchable objects on every page.
3,The Einstein Illustrations are too odd,"I was so excited to get this book, but my 11 month old gave it a less than enthusiastic review. She looks away from this book quite a bit when I read it to her. Sometimes she even pushes it away and reaches for other books. I think is the very stylized way the pictures are rendered. It's too hard for her baby brain to figure out WTH she is looking at. So she prefers to ""read"" books where the images are a little more obvious, i.e. the monkey actually looks like a monkey."
3,Its ok,"Its a cute book, but way over priced for what you get. I guess its because it's baby einstein, your paying for the brand more than the book."
5,The best touch & feel book we have!,"We bought this for our 10 month son and from day one he has ADORED it. Even now, at 12 months, he's still facinated, particularly with the 'sticky' finger paints and the yarn hair of the doll. This is one of the best touch & feel books I've ever seen. Couldn't recommend it more!"
5,A Favorite in Our House,"This book was a gift, which my 14-month old daughter recently pulled off the bookshelf and instantly loved. Although she usually is not interested in having books ""read"" to her, she loves when the scenes are described to her, and she can find and point out the objects on the pages. Each room in ""Violet's House"" has lots of objects for me to name, and for her to point to. She also loves touching the interesting textures on every page. Almost every morning, she wakes up and goes for this book. Highly recommended!"
5,Mr.,Grandchild really enjoyed the book. One of her favorites since not many kids books are about girls.
4,Great interactive book,"This is a great book for toddlers. My daughter loves to feel the touch and feel parts of this book. She likes the ""sticky paints"" especially! This is a full story, rather than just ""touch and feel"". That is the real incentive to pick it up.Another wonderful Baby Einstein product!"
2,so disappointed,"I was so happy to find these. The measurements were perfect. I liked the color and the price. However, when they arrivedyesterday, I had a real problem. They may have a wide calf but the ankle is so narrow that I can't get it on over my foot. I dohave a wide foot but then that has never been a problem before. The toe box is soft and loose as is the heel but the stocking itself is very stiff and coarse. Now some of that may wash out, but not much I'm thinking. What a shock. This was the last thing I ever expected from a stocking."
3,They were ok,"They were ok. I wear them all day. Like the color. Somewhat comfy, Wash well. I won't be buying more."
4,Truform Support Hose,"This product is a resonably, good product that has been available from Amazon for several years in my size. My only disappointment is that Amazon seems to be letting its stock run down and may no longer offer the good price on this product."
2,Huh?,"This is not the Anders Osborne that I have come to love. I am not sure what it is. If you like Anders; if you like the bluesy New Orleans flair, then you may want to pass on this one. Often it is just almost silly."
3,"Strong characters, will written, gory","Tolteca by K. Michael Wright is rich with imagery, some poetic prose and memorable characters. Topiltzin is a prince who leaves his father's kingdom to play the rubberball game in the south. The south has changed because of a bloodthirsty prophet warrior named Smoking Mirror. Instead of a game, Topiltzin and his teammates find unbelievable atrocities in the southern villages. Being a prince, he must respond.This is the story of the conflicts between Topilzin, Smoking Mirror and many others around the area that is now Mexico City in the years 421 to 576 AD. It is both sympathetic and very gory. It provides a motive to the atrocities and sacrifices that some believe took place during this time.While not a fantasy, it is written from a point of view that allows that the fantastic might happen. Historical or literary characters, such as Quetzalcoatl and Mormon play roles."
1,I couldn't finish it...,"This has to be one of the worst romances I've come across. The writing is stilted, the authorial voice is heavy and intrusive. The author tells the reader how the characters are feeling and what their motivations are very blatantly rather than letting the characters reveal themselves through their actions. The hero was deeply unsympathetic(if some creep strongarmed me onto a ship, locked me in a room and went off to fix my future for me, his chances of getting willing action would disappear, never to be seen again), the pairing totally implausible (except for the fact that the heroine was 16, and we were all morons and put up with more than we should have at 16), and, well, the writing was awful.This is not an author I will ever spend money on again..."
3,original story,"new story not a tv episode writing is quite good flows richard hatch take note, recommend to bsg fans"
3,Bits and Pieces,"When you incorporated a disk from three different box sets (Blackstar - The Complete Series,The Secrets of Isis - The Complete Series, andSpace Sentinels: The Complete Series & The Freedom Force: The Complete Series...you have this collectionSince I own all three DVD box sets, all you are getting is a retread with no extras to speak of.All three are good Filmation productions from the 70's and the 80's. However, it just seemed like BCI just took a disk from each show and slap tashed into a collectionThere are no extras in this. It is just good shows, but BCI when you do collections like this and there are a few upcoming from them..Just throw an extra something into the mix to make this special...otherwise it is a waste of my money paying for something I already haveBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
3,Overall review,I am glad to have bought it to my collection. The Only thing I wish it had both dvd's (the comp. series) of Blackstar and Isis.
4,flashback,The set of clips that were on this dvd were of very good quality. It was a real blast from the past. Great!!!
3,"Cheap collar, slow shipping for the price.",The collar is the texture of 2 or 3 layers of hospital gown and folded into a small bubble envelope. Was shipped from a few states away and took a week to get here. Could have been sent priority for what I paid in shipping.
5,Trimline Soft Collar,I use these soft collar's on my cat. She has allergy's and gets ear infections often. She doesn't seem to mind wearing these and it keeps her from scratching at her face and ears.
3,'Angel' - not the hit the web thinks it is,"There seems to be a web-wide scam going on about this Jones Gang song 'Angel', with many (unreliable) sources falsely claiming that it reached number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for many weeks circa 2005/6. So, I did further research on this song. While the 'number one' claim is still B.S., the song did creep up to number 30 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart. Still, I believe some overzealous fan(s) and/or employee(s) of the band are trying to rewrite history to inflate the band's perceived importance."
3,A huge bag,"I'm from Belgium and in Europe we don't have a lot of choice when it comes to laptop bags. Friends of mine who live in Madison sent it to me.When I saw it, I was surprised by its size. I already knew it was a BIG bag, but it was HUGE (and I'm tall, almost 6 feet) so when you're a small person, I recommend you to look for an other bag. When you see the bag on the picture, it looks like a normal bag but in fact, it's really huge.The advantage is that you have enough space for charger, mouse, some magazines or papers ... The bag is also of a high quality so you don't have to worry about your laptop."
4,Wrong Book Pictured,"The book pictured is actually A Child's History of Art - Sculpture. The painting book should be green. And, sure enough, when I ordered the book, the book I received was the red one on sculpture, as pictured, although my receipt and shipping order says ""A Child's History of Art - Painting."" Until the image is changed, you may need to verify which book the seller actually has."
2,Computer mixed or not....,"This mix isn't anything to get excited about. It showcases one track in my opinion and that track is F--K Sonnet. The rest of the tracks are bland and lack character. I notice a lot of users commenting on the fact that it is computer mixed versus live on turntables. Computer mixing is a skill in itself as well, the capabilities of turntables these days makes them almost like using a computer. DJs have the ability to look at a waveform using tables just as easily as on a computer these days, and with Final Scratch most DJ racks are becoming more computerized. So I honestly don't think the equipment used effected this mix, it's just a bit boring and does nothing to grab the listener's attention. Considering the pioneering choice of equipment, this mix could have tried to be a lot more adventurous. As it stands this is one to skip. Like someone mentioned before, I will be awaiting a Steve Lawler Bedrock compilation."
3,Mediocre as far as Bedrock is concerned,"The 3 stars, I gave for the album, could be blamed on the precedence set by Jimmy van M and Fortier.Creamer & Stephane K compilation doesn't even get close to them. Anyway, if you are a Bedrock fan I guess you know what to do, if not there are other higher quality releases to spend your money on.BTW there is a rumor that the next Bedrock album would be compiled and mix by the very Steve Lawler. That would be something to look forward to."
2,NY-trash-prog.,"not a ""dj journey"" but, as the linear notes mention, ""a collection of singles."" and that's how it feels. expecting more along the epic lines of past bedrock mixes, this one, well, [isn't very good]. trashy prog. house. dirty, not epic. i'm sure it would be fun and sound proper in nyc loft parties, or even one or two of these tracks thrown into a[nother] mix. but randomly and on a bedrock mix it's a large disapointment.if you're down with the past bedrock mix-cds and ... live sets, avoid this. if you're a prog junkie down with sleazy sounds and don't allready have these on 12"", well, you probably allready own this."
5,Madwoman of Chaillot,This is a really fun film it combines comedy and social comment. ALL the actors are excellent - from the magnificent Katherine Hepburn to the young Richard Chamberlain and Danny Kaye's defence speech is great. I will certainly watch it again and again. I just wish I could get it on DVD
1,Totally mad,The story does no justice to the great cast of this movie. Every character seems a bit soft in his/her head in this flick.
1,Terrible,"This is one of the worst records I have ever heard. Half the songs sound as though the singer could break into ""Hava Nagila"" at any time. And that would be an improvement. Seriously, all the songs sound the same and the lyrics are like bad Woody Guthrie. Beware, this abysmal record..."
1,Do not buy or rent this DVD,"This DVD is a collection of still photographs of Whitney and people around her, there is no music and no footage of any of her award winning performances, it seems as if the people that will profit from the sale of this DVD just put together a lot of pictures, quite a lot of them are of her early days and childhood and of her mother, and then they added a voice over. my 15 year old nephew could have put this together. Shame on the producers of this DVD for such a misleading product."
1,Not what I expected...at all!,Just ok. Drop Clive Davis name from this doc. U didn't interview him. The people that were interviewed didn't know Whitney that intimately.
1,School project,Seriously don't waste the money. It's seriously a behind the music episode without ANY music. I guess they didn't have the liscensing rights to any of her songs? Whatever it's really pretty bad. And the interviews are sketch comedy bad....
1,Horrible depiction of a great legend,This entire documentary was negative and only depicted the falls and struggles of Whitney. The film was clearly not supported by many when they only had insignificant people talk for an hour of how much she struggled. These people make me wonder what will people say about them at their funeral. The film was stupid and a waste of my time!
1,not what I expected,Nothing in this that hasn't already been shown on the news. waste of money :( Wish they would have shown more
1,TERRIBLE!,TERRIBLE! They didn't play a single song. This was only clips from public aired shows which leads me to believe it wasn't sanctioned by her estate and with good reason. They should be ashamed!
5,Loved it.,"The movie was insightful and fun. No problems viewing it either. The tour guide was interesting, but makes me wonder if he knew what he was talking about or full of it. Whitney rules!"
2,Formating woes,"The story and writing was fun, just as I remembered. The Kindle version is almost painful to read, however, as the punctuation is almost nonexistent and spelling errors abound.I was excited to get some mindless reading material for travel, but this was difficult to handle.Summary: Fun story, poor formatting."
3,No quotation marks used for dialogue.,"The problem with this book's ebook formatting was that no quotation marks or apostrophes were used at all. This made following the dialogue between characters very difficult. I really liked the Destroyer series and would like to have all of the books available on kindle, but not if the formatting isn't improved. I am also not sure why only a few of the books are available for the Kindle. I will be downloading trial chapters of any future Destroyer books that I intend to buy in order to verify the formatting. I give the story an overall rating of 3 stars out of respect for Chiun."
3,Mejor el otro...,"A diferencia del excelente album de esta agrupacion que puedes encontrar en esta pagina, éste disco nos presenta un sonido más evidente y urbano, prefiero la busqueda mas perversa del disco siguiente..."
2,Few fuels,This clattering drum and bass sophomore merely exploits a cheaply limited sonic assault to shallowly indulgent effect.
5,SENSUOUS - ALWAYS!,"Since this perfume debuted at Neiman Marcus-Dallas, it's been on my dressing table, and never has it been worn that it wasn't noticed; in fact, my Dentist was so in awe of it, he bought it for his wife! Love it!For a while it was very hard to find, so I purchased it in Paris! I have not strayed from using this specific scent for years, and I will not; I'm addicted."
1,HORRID READ!,This book is absolutely horrible. The photos are mislabeled (Olga and Maria as Alexandra?!) and there's nothing new and interesting. I don't think it deserves even one star.
4,Mark Twain at his best,"Mark Twain is well known for his Mississippi Novels and Historical Romances but it's on his Tales and Sketches where you can find the commical genious in him. It's in my opinion that it's an age span wich makes you like the most Tom Sawyer (8-12), The Prince and the Pauper (13-16) or The Diary of Adam and Eve (18-) and yet, in his complete tales you may find contents of interest for all kinds of readers. And you will never find a better edition than the one that Library of America has to offer. Hardcover, cloth wrapping and alk. paper makes the reading an extra pleasure over the one Mark Teain already gives you. Love Twain and love the edition."
4,Wow! Thanks Mark!,"This, the first of two of this type, shows Twain dazzling us with moods and styles, tall tales and short stories, satire, essays, speeches,fables and many other things that make this a must read for the American Literature enthusiast."
1,bad mtor,"worked about 3 days an quit replaced it again, replaced motor and it made lots of noise when ranning and ran 3days and stopped working replaced it with a different motor and still trying to get it to working again after this one locked up."
2,Shallow,Ms. Ross should have put her ego asided and hired a good ghostwriter like David Ritz to tell her story. One of the most shallow autobiographies I've ever read
3,Cotton Candy,"This book was somewhat disappointing. It's best described as light and airy. I enjoyed Ross' recollections of her childhood, but she's not very forthcoming about her years as a Supreme. I can understand ""taking the high road"", but there comes a time when you need to come clean and tell your side of the story. While she mentions her siblings, she never gives insight as to what her relationships are with them. However Ross does give insight as to why her first marriage failed. She is also pretty candid about her relationship with Berry Gordy. I understand Ross is writing another book. Hopefully she will dig deeper and help us understand who she really is."
5,Diana Ross... A Living Legend Indeed!,"I've been a huge fan of Diana Ross since I was a child and this book has been long anticipated to me to finally hear her life story. Unlike many autobiographies this one focuses on her life as an entertainer, a mother, a wife, and her early childhood years and most importantly no dirt on other entertainers. I don't know about you guys, but writing trash about other people you don't really know, especially if they're not true is kinda getting old and way annoying. Diana is true 'CLASS'! I'm glad I purchased this book not only being a fan of Diana Ross, but also the inspiration she delivers through her words. If you want to read positive views on life and love from an entertainer with ""CLASS"", then this book is definitely one worth reading."
1,"Unbelievable, worst read about Motown ever","I'm a Motown fan and the opportunity to read about Diana Ross was interesting one until I read the book. I was astonished at the lack of any personal responsibility when it came to the Supremes, etc. I found myself wondering if she was the only person at Motown. This book, by far, is the worst book featuring a Motown artist. If you have ever read Mary Wilson's books or any other books, stay away from this one. Ross's view of events is so glossed over I could barely recognize what really happened. The woman sure does have the right to tell her own story, but this was insulting."
1,Don't need to know the Sparrow's secrets,"Unless you are a die hard Diana Ross fan, don't bother. It's not worth it. It's very boring. Refer to my review title."
2,Diana wake up and smell the capuccino!!!!!!,"Does Diana Ross thinks she is a supreme being sent from heaven? Without a doubt, she IS a multitalented mega superstar, but I am tired of her brushing the Supremes aside, like she was never a part of it. Her ""chapters"" on the Supremes were so short and dishonest I got sick to my stomach, who is she trying to fool. We all know she stepped on Mary Wilson and Florence Ballard's backs, and slept with Berry Gordy to become a star on her own, with no consideration of what would become of her two friends. But like the old saying , what goes around comes around. A tv movie about the Supremes is in the works and Diana is supposed to be behind it, lets hope it not a lot of ""rubish"" like her book. Mary Wilson should be contacted on this, if you want THE TRUTH!!!!!"
2,not honest at all,Diana still thinks she is God's gift. I feel she is the cause of the Supremes break-up. She and Berry Gordy did Florence like a dog. She is just a rich ........ She could have kept those lies to herself.
1,Diana Dross,"I knew nothing about Diana Ross before I read this book and it's made me positively hate the woman. She comes across as a self serving meglomaniac who lives in her own made-up dream world. She just LOVES herself, she's awful. If she thinks people can't see through the drivvel of this book she's even more thick than she comes across."
5,Great Sound Quality,"I ordered these on the recommendation of a friend of mine. The box arrived on time and in good shape. Everything was well packed to prevent damage. I unpacked and set up speakers around the room using the included guide. It was very easy to set up. The sound quality is really good. Very rich and full.My only complaint was that i needed about 25feet more wire, but I also have a large living room so most will be okay."
4,roller ok for rolling latex seams,"roller ok for rolling latex seams, i just wished they did a extreme closeup on the ridges.. was kinda a surprise.. i expected a smooth roller. very sturdy feel and nice tool-like handling does not feel cheap."
5,Excellent salt,"This salt is very unique and has a deep, sharp flavor. Its crystals are quite large and multi-faceted, and can easily be crushed with the fingers. Beautiful presentation when used with contrasting colored foods such as salmon."
5,Tight Fit But Will Stretch,"I purchased this bag to protect a medium format telephoto lens, 250mm for a 6x7. I took a chance that the bag would be broad enough for the diameter of this lens. It did work, but the fit was quite tight. The bag has become a nicely fitting sleeve for this lens after leaving the lens in the bag for 2 weeks. It turned out to be just what I needed. When in doubt, go for the bag that will stretch."
3,"It fits my 70-300mm lens, just not what i've expected","I thought this is the same with the other pouch i was searching for, i was expecting a rounded shape at the bottom but it's more of rectangular. In any case it still works."
5,Great pouch!,I have a Canon Rebel XSi and I bought a body pouch for the camera that only fits with the kit lens. I bought this separate pouch to carry around my 100 prime lens. This works perfectly and I keep it in my purse (I can fit both my camera and lens in my purse). I am very happy with this product and it should last for several yearsr (good quality construction).
5,Excellent,"This book is great. It has information on hunters, normal humans, sorceress and more. It has become very important for my Mage LARP.You will not be disappointed with this book. A Must for any Mind's Eye Theatre Storyteller."
5,a cat like mine,"Hi, My name is Gabe. I am ten years old. Our family liked your book because we have two cats, named Garfield and Kiki. Garfield looks like Ginger. He was our family cat and Kiki is the new kitten. She bugs Garfield like the kitten bugged Ginger in your book.We read your book. I love your illustrations. I am an artist too and love cats too. As you said in your story the two cats got along, I hope that happens to our cats too.We just read your book. Do you have real cats that do the same thing? I would like to write funny stories about cats. We hope to have you email us.Thank you for writing the book. Maybe I will write a story about my cats when I grow up.Your book reader, Gabriel"
5,"""Ginger"" is a keeper","I was captivated by the illustrations as well as the narration of the simple but engaging story. Charlotte Voake has cat expressions and behaviours down pat! Ginger's look of appalled aggrievement when the kitten clambers, in such perfect kitten style, into his basket, captures feline character perfectly. And the illustration for ""The kitten waited for a bit, then he got into Ginger's basket. It wasn't the same without Ginger."" is priceless. I bought this book for my godchild but haven't been able to relinquish it! Well, she can have it soon - as long as she keeps it at my house."
5,...because cats love cardboard boxes...,"This is a wonderful book - my son loves it as much as my husband and I do. Our own real-life old-orange-cat-grumpy-about-new-kitten experience makes it that much more special, but my favorite is the Great Truth about cats at the end!"
2,Frustration at its best,"This was a gift for my 10 1/2 year old son. The cars fly off the track and seem to like to come to their final resting place under furniture. This racetrack is best used in a very large open area. My son set it up in his large bedroom, but had to use various empty boxes to set up a barricade so that the cars wouldn't fly under the bed.The track is very sensitive. Any little particle of dust or even a small hair will make the car stop dead in its tracks.The hand held control is also very touchy. Very easy to give it ""too much"" juice... and very hard to regulate.The ""bridge"" area is not supported well and you have to 'reconnect' the connections there quite frequently.This was not only frustrating for my 10 1/2 year old. It frustrated his older brother (13 1/2) and his dad as well!"
1,BGO version sound quality.,"This bgo is remastered at a remarkable low volume level - noticeably less volume than the 1990 MCA version.The bgo is slightly (slightly) more dynamic, but you can't tell unless you raise the volume levels.The Bgo has an annoying tape wobble at the start of Sad and Deep as You. The MCA does not.So, if you have editing software to increase the volume levels of the bgo to a reasonable level, then strip in the first 2 seconds of Sad and Deep as You from the original MCA CD version, you will notice a slightly better sound from your own newly remastered CD.Bgo - isn't remastering your job?This review is for Alone Together, I have nothing to compare Headkeeper"
5,Twister...,"Perhaps you've seen the movie Twister. Not the one with Helen Hunt. You know, the weird one with Crispin Glover. Well, it was based on ""Oh!"" I enjoyed the movie so much, I looked for the book. Lo and behold, my brother found a used copy at Powell's bookshop in Oregon. All I can say is that Mary Robison writes about situations that may seem absurd, but are so true to life. Her short stories just seem to drift off, like life itself.""Oh!"" is the same way. This book makes me feel alive.Yes, I know this is an awful review, but as a result of reading this (and all Mary Robison I could get my hands on), she became my favorite author. She is the master of the vignette, and her characters seem so real. She grips you with life and doesn't let go..."
5,Mademoiselle Mabry has a Fender Rhodes,"The beauty and the Genius of this album is how that it not only signals the departure of cool jazz into electric jazz and eventually fusion, but more importantly, how it shows that Miles was already way ahead of the crew! Briefly, although I find the first 4 tracks excellent, it is Mademoiselle Mabry that really blows me away! Miles' playing is so differently lyrical. He plays less but communicates so much more. Although the piece is coherent and, to me, far from a 'ballad', I wonder if after (and I mean years after) Wayne Shorter thought he sounded too 'old-school' for lack of a better expression. Very highly recommended for this track alone!"
4,"Helpful, but...","This book is probably all you really need to ""study"" from... but make sure you do a lot of practice tests under TIMED conditions. What the book lacks that a course might offer is some insight into the process of actually taking the real test- I was easily scoring in my target range but when the test day came I scored lower than in my very first practice test before I did any preparation- simply because of nerves and having a watch rather than a timer in the test room with me. Some insight into the test day, the lengthy administration, the fact that they call '5 minutes left' (which for some reason freaked me out every time) would help calm nerves which can really be what mastering the LSAT is all about- mastering your nerves."
3,YOU are the ultimate master,"I purchased this book after reading so many great responses on Amazon. In actuality, the people that purchased this book and had so much success must have also incorporated what they learned from a prep class. This book is not the end-all-be-all under no circumstance. I must agree the games section is great. It does tend to venture into areas not touched on the real LSAT but if you are also using 10 Real LSATS you will get a feel for which games you do not have to prepare for. I got nothing from the arguement and reading comprehension sections. IN a nutshell: This book does surpass the other LSAT books that are on the market by far, however, in order to truly master the LSAT please enroll in a prep class, do all of the exams in 10 Real LSATS and use this book as a reference guide. By using the above formula you will have no choice other than to succeed. Good Luck."
5,Unlike any other LSAT prep book,"Master the LSAT is one of the few LSAT books in which all of the explanations offer practical, efficient approaches to the problems. This is in sharp contrast to books that present what merely sound like great tricks or ""insider information,"" but which, in reality, have little applicability to real exam questions.Thankfully, much of the book focuses on Logic Games, which is typically the section with which people have the most trouble. The other sections, Reading Comprehension and Arguments, are covered with the same, no-nonsense approach. This appears to be one of the few books to use actual LSAT questions, as opposed to simulated problems of questionable authenticity.For years, we used Master the LSAT in our Gorilla Test Prep LSAT course. Though this an excellent book, we have since switched to Professor Dave's LSAT Advantage, as it is superior in a number of key areas."
3,Buy only if you are scoring above 150,"I tried to do self-study for the LSAT and researched the market for the best LSAT book. So I bought this book because IT IS the best LSAT self-study book, but it did not improve my score.I think if you are scoring below 150, like me, then you should definitely take a full length live course. No amount of self-study will help, unless you can pick up ideas just by reading and dont need someone to explain it to you."
1,OUTDATED,"I bought this book for a new outlook on the LSAT, but am very disappointed in it. The Reading Comprehension section is outdated, despite the fact that the section was changed in 2007. I was also very appalled that they encourage you to skip a full section in the Logic Games. In every other course or book that I have done, it is encouraged to at least guess on a question you are unsure of providing you with 5-8 potential points. Lastly, the online course is misleading. From what I gathered from looking at it briefly, it is nothing more than the text from the book online, thus making it falsely advertised.Instead of this book, I would recommend books from Barrons, McGraw Hill, Manhattan, or anything straight from LSAC."
3,eh it has its moments,"The best thing about this book is probably its games section. Although I use other diagramming techniques then the ones suggested in the book the sheer number of examples, numerous of which are taken from real lsats are a plus. The logic reasoning section is decent as far as examples go but i think there own question and teaching methods confused me more. the reading comp section just seemed unnecessary. Good examples but really all you can do on this to improve is to read. Also I believe theres an error on one of the games in the practice test so beware."
1,COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT-BAD CD,"This was and still is a COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT. The CD didn't work, the questions do not at all reflect the real type of LSAT questions, and the publisher refused to refund my money.You decide if you want to spend your money on a COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT !!THE CD DOES NOT WORK !!!!"
3,not for kindle,"The book is okay. At times I feel that it could be clearer, but some of the strategies offered are fairly helpful.However, I would suggest that you NOT get the kindle version. I was attracted by the possibility of saving some money, but doing these exercises would be much easier if you could write in the book. You are also frequently required to flip several pages between a problem and its solution. Since the problems are not re-written with the solutions and since there are no hyperlinks in the text to help you, this process is incredibly tedious in electronic format."
2,disappointed,This is the first LSAT book I am using to study for my LSAT exam in October. Some of the questions that I came into contact with were wrong! I answered the question then looked at the explanation only to find out they worded the question wrong. I looked at the reviews prior to ordering this book so I was confident that this book would get me started on the right track. Now I am questioning what is right and what is wrong. Look for another book. Good luck.
3,Good Springboard,"If you're just starting out to study for the test then you could do worse than by reading this book. Although it does get progressively less useful, especially in the games section. I'm leaning toward the realization that almost no book can effectively break down how to solve logic games. However, I think this book really helped me with arguments. It basically outlined the distractors and logical fallacies. Utlimately this book was a heck of a lot better than the Princeton Review book. I haven't really looked at the Kaplan book. However, I think this book was solid, but it does have a few typos. Oh yeah, you might as well use the CD as a coaster. It's just a horrible rehash of things in the book in a really old school presentation."
1,Wasn't what I thought it would be,"I honestly bought this book thinking it would be a good book to study by. I read the reviews and was convinced that they were correct. I've finished the games section of the book and am half way through the logic part of the book and there are errors all over the place! Some of the questions come from actual LSAT exams, these questions are fine, but the vast majority are not from old LSAT exams, they are written by the author and they are VERY poorly written. I've already emailed the publisher about five mistakes I've found, needless to say I have yet to hear back. Some of the ideas on how to solve the questions are worthwhile, but just skip doing the practice questions unless it states they are from the LSAT exam, otherwise you are wasting your time."
3,It'll certainly help you with familiarity...,"I bought this book to study for the LSAT and at the time I certainly didn't know what to expect. It's a decent primer to familiarize yourself with the test. Unfortunately, I didn't find much in the way of strategy beyond the games section. The authors do make a few good suggestions, and the book certainly did a lot to say what the test would be like and how fast time would fly, but it really did little to teach me any techniques to use for the argument or reading comprehension sections. To be honest, I would likely have learned the same amount if I'd just taken two or three practice tests. The book also repeats several questions and there are a number of glaring typos which are both distracting from the material and fairly unprofessional considering the price and the subject matter."
4,"Fairly Useful, But Not Enough","As a professional LSAT tutor in NYC and the owner of an LSAT blog, I can say that it's essential to do real practice exams as well from recent LSAT preptests. Good luck!"
4,Complete Study Guide,"The CD-ROM is not as user friendly and interactive as it should be, but the book itself is an excellent tool for preparing for the LSAT.The logic games section is the best that I've seen - and I purchased 4 prep books. If you are looking for 1 book to buy to help you get ready - this should be the one.The tests, strategies and organization of the book are easy to follow. Buy this book with a book of prep tests, and you should be good to go.The only drawback is that the book does not cover the newer ""principle"" questions in the logical reasoning. Otherwise, there is plenty of detail."
