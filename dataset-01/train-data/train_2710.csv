1,The Science Guy,"I ordered these because they were a bit cheaper than NOW's pills. NOW I see why, they really don't work for me where NOW was noticable, this is not. Spend the 2-5 bucks more and get NOW's supplements"
3,Select story for select audience...?,"Rogers offers a look at the first capital of the Confederacy -albeit the capital for a mere handful of months. Rogers then expands focus on Montgomery for the remaining war years ('61-'65). Although Rogers presents the city of Montgomery as a ""microcosm"" of other Southern cities, I find Rogers offers little to defend his thesis. Except for its ""15 minutes"" as the capital, Montgomery, for the most part, largely escapes the ravages of other towns/cities/villages of the Deep South. I really found not much of a story to tell within these pages. Indeed there is only 156 pages of readable text!"
4,Pas Pire,"I think you definitely need to be very familiar with Quebecois culture to get into this film. The premise is ""moving day"" - July 1st. Most leases in Quebec begin and end on July 1st so there is always a tremendous frenzy, challenges finding a moving truck, things not going as planned... and this film focuses on a cast of characters as they negotiate all these things. Having lived and moved in Montreal at the same age as the characters in the film it definitely struck a cord, but for someone who hasn't really experienced it I can't imagine this moving holding much interest."
3,Tank Shooter,"Game is good for those times when you don't want to think too much. Game is basically a series of run and gun tank battles. Graphics are good, story is weak (but who cares with a game like this). Game installs easily and does not require a key disk to play the game. Not sure it's worth the price as a new game, but would recommend it at a used game price."
1,First Battalion,"I tried to install this game but kept getting a strange error message.I uninstalled and reinstalled and kept getting the same error message. It saya it will run on Windows XP, but I could not get it to run. I tried changing the properties and even ran it in Windows 95 but could not get it to run. I even tried to install and run on an older laptop but got the same error. I tried to get help from Dreamcatcher website but they do not even list the game, no help there."
3,"A fun game, but nothing special","This game is fun, but when compared to other games where you can drive a tank, it doesn't offer much that is new or different.One thing I do like that is often lacking in military/tank shooters is that the landscape is destructible. No having your tank blocked by saplings or wooden fences. Your cannon can be used to reduce houses and churches to rubble.The enemy AI is not very bright. It mostly works on mass attack slug fest."
1,I GUESS YOU CAN SAY YOU 'HATE' A GAME THAT FAILS TO LOAD/PLAY,"Am I right? I THINK another case of my having too much hardware for this game. PHOOEY. I think consoles are the way to go. I mean, you'll ALWAYS have a game that will play. With PCs, if you need to upgrade or if WINDOWS does their thing and comes out with something new....all of a sudden your game is unplayable. What a racquet."
4,"Yeah, Cajun Cutie, short on the spice","I agree with some of the other reviews, this story was lacking a little. It could have used a little more action all the way around and a tighter, more put together plot. I still enjoyed it, it is a fun fluffy quick weekend read."
3,Adequate but not great quality,"I got these canisters about 5 years ago and they have some drawbacks which is why I am now replacing them. The plastic tops cracked near the edges on the 3 biggest canisters within the first year. The hinges are somewhat wacky and don't stay aligned, occasionally coming apart. They are also somewhat sharp. The rubber seal along the lid that creates the airtight seal frequently needs to be put back on as it slides off. Overall these canisters are nice looking but relatively low quality."
1,no no,"too small size was deceiveing only for small amounts would not buy again, gave it as a gift and was unhappy"
3,Stainless Steel Canisters Not as Sturdy as Expexted,"These look, and description sounds like they are sturdy. NOT? A bit flimsy but look fairly nice. Wish I had purchased the more expensive, pottery style."
2,Absolute crap,"They are air tight, but the canisters are very, very light weight and cheap. They remind me of the $20 canisters you could get at Walmart, yet here, they are $45! Complete rip off $$$ wise. Save your money for something else."
4,Not as easy as falling down,The instructions included are not terribly helpful if you want to control this as a system. It took a while to figure it out on my own.The unit takes up a lot of space in the wall box. Be sure you have the space in the box and be sure you have a ground as well as hot wire in the wall box.
2,Just OK,"We were hoping for something more interesting. We don't see much of Don Cherry in the U.S., since he is on TV in Canada but we thought he was supposed to be interesting and controversial. Coach's Corner is basically a fashion show (not much hockey discussed). The hockey action highlights are fine - a compilation of what you see on TV throughout the year. But there is no accompanying audio commentary (not even the original game announcers). There is only a single, repetitive soundtrack. It gets monotonous."
2,A bunch of scraps,Feltthat it was a bunch of scraps for a very expensive price. I felt like this company was giving me their trash.
5,Making it worth searching for new tunes...,"I don't know much about these Finns, but that won't stop me from listening this record over and over again. The soothing female vocals and synths make this incredibly succesful mix of chilled-out funky pop complete. Listen to the bass lines in 'Disbelief' and 'Night After Night', which are somewhat Incubus-like, or to one of my favorites - opening track 'Tomorrow', which could be described as 'Wicked Beat Sound System meets Briskeby'. All in all, this is one of those albums that make it worth searching for new artists all the time..."
2,Critical Thinking Workbook Stident Edition to Accompany Elem,"I found the workbook to be of little use. There are no answers to the solutions. The problems are practical, however, to know if I have worked them correctly, I would like the step-by-step solutions."
1,Dead,"Bought my Vector Sport Spot Elite expecting good things. After Charging for 18 hours.....No Spot light of any kind, and the area light even looks dim. The charger was warm like it was charging, but the light or charger is obviously defective...Nice looking light.....too bad it's defective. I'd choose another brand."
5,A simple task.......perfected,"It's certainly not an engineering feat to toast a piece of bread, however, I've never been able to have a toaster that was consistent each time I used it. THIS ONE IS!!! It toasts evenly, quickly and consistently."
1,Don't buy it.,"I bought this and stupidly threw away the packaging before trying it out. I was going out on a limb since it's way more expensive than any other toaster I've seen. Well, finally tried it out and only the top half of a slice of bread gets toasted. I would guess the bottom element doesn't work. Looks cool though. The downside of buying on-line. I'll never throw the packaging away again."
1,Not Safe,"I bought this to contain my 10 pound dog in the car, as well as to keep him safer if we should be in an accident. The seat itself fit him well, but the clip that attaches to his harness is made out of cheap plastic and my dog was able to pull on it enough so that the hook itself came out from its holder. If we had been in any kind of accident it wouldn't have held him at all.It was difficult to put this in the back seat, and would only work if you have a back seat that splits. It was also time consuming to always have to adjust it when you put it in a different seat.I returned the product and instead purchased a seat belt harness. It gives him more room and he is much safer."
1,Needs replacement planes,"We got this plane as a gift for my son's birthday and thought it was great, however after 1 day of play the tail broke off of the plane and the body of the plane is torn. I went in search of replacement planes and there are no replacements. I would have bought replacements if they had been available. Now I get to listen to my son cry because he wants a new airplane. Thanks fisher price."
2,GREAT TOY BUT NO LONGEIVITY WITHOUT REPLACEMENT PLANES,"This is a great idea and works greats at first. Our 4 year old son loves it. But, we just bought it last night and upon seeing how much he liked it I immediately looked to see if replacement planes could be purchased. It is clear from the start that the foam plane won't last long even though the launcher is very sturdy. Sure enough, by this afternoon my son is now launching a plane that is torn and has lost its tail. This should come with several planes or a replacement pack should be sold. The toy is a great idea but the plane won't last."
1,"Not durable, careful of the little ball falling out!","Like the other reviews. This plane will fall apart within a week! We got it for Christmas and it has already (in 7 days) been repaired once and now it's done! Be careful too, there is a little ball bearing in the plane that fell out in our plane. Just hope I find it before my 17 mo. old daugthter does. Thanks F.P.!!"
2,Planes are poor quality and don't last more than a day,"My review is just the same as the others posted. We bought two planes for my 3 and 4 year olds for Christmas. BOTH broke on Christmas Eve, about an hour after playing with them. One of them broke completely in half and the other is in tact, but the plastic strip on the bottom that connects it to the launcher came off. So now we're out about $30. I checked Fisher Price's website and they do not seem to offer replacement parts for this toy. I tried calling but received a recording that their call volume is high and to try back later. Needless to say, I will."
1,"cheap foam, not durable","I bought this plane for my 4 year old son. He was excited to fly the plane, but needed assistance to set it into the launcher. After just 1/2 day of use, the plane ripped apart at the wings from my son putting the plane in the launcher himself. It is poorly made and needs replacements after just a few uses. It does fly well and is fun- but just doesn't last! Thumbs down!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Fun for 5 minutes,My son loved this toy for the 5 minutes we played with it before the plane itself ripped into pieces as my wife tried to put it on the launcher.
2,"Great idea, tragically flawed",This was a great toy for about 2 days. Totally shredded and worthless since you can't buy new planes for the launcher. The plastic piece ripped right of the foam after using it a few times. Total piece of junk. Great concept but needs to be WAY more durable for child play.
2,Need replacement airplanes,"I agree with the other comments. My son absolutely loves this toy but the foam plane rips off easily as it's loaded into the base. I bought this a couple months ago and although it was one of my son's favorites, it ripped after a week. I bought it a second time for Xmas at the sale price of $4 and my son was thrilled...but the plane ripped again after only an hour of play.If replacement planes could be bought at a reasonable price, then I would recommend this toy but as it is now...definitely not worth it."
2,Launcher Broke within a week,"The plane was fun at first, but the launcher broke within a week. The plane had to be in just right, and that only sometimes worked. We didn't have any issues with the plane durability. The kids wound up just throwing the plane around without the launcher."
3,Fun but Flimsy,"A family member bought this for my then 3 year old son and I thought he would lose interest soon. It is loud and annoying for the grown-ups, but he had a blast with it-so much that it had to be replaced after a year. The part that is supposed to ""pull"" the plane back to get ready for launch seldom does that, so he manually pulls the plane back instead. This causes the foam plane to wear out and eventually tear off of its base. The 2nd one we bought only lasted 5 months this time, but he still likes playing with the launching gun so I don't think it was a waste to buy it. No educational value other than the problem solving and motor skills needed to put the plane on the launcher. I think any kids that likes planes will enjoy this toy."
2,Launcher stopped working after a week,"While I made it abundantly clear to my boys that the airplane is fragile (we learned that from having Air Hogs), it turns out that the launcher stopped automatically loading the plane and making all those jet noises after only a week. Fresh batteries didn't help. All that happens is you get two annoying beeps when you shake it. My 5-year-old and 3-year-old sons are very disappointed...they really love airplanes. I plan to contact Fisher Price about it."
4,A very good submarine read,I enjoyed the book very much. Being a former submariner I felt that the author knew what he was talking about.The book was hard to put down. I would recommend it to all those who like an adventure techno thriller with a lot of quick paced action.
4,"Excellent, approachable Italian recipes","From Biba's table to yours...this excellent, uncomplicated book features dozens of formulas for easy-to-prepare soups, pastas, antipastis, gnocchi, seafood, meat and poultry dishes, vegetables, pizzas and desserts.After sampling many recipes, Biba's meat dishes were the intial attraction for me. (The osso bucco was sublime.)However, since my husband and I have become vegetarians, I've turned to Biba's soup, salad and vegetable recipes and have found her strengths to be evenly disbursed, though I wish there were more vegetable and salad recipes included. The soups are hugely satisfying, but fairly simple to make.This is one of my non-vegetarian books I still turn to a on a regular basis."
1,New apparently didn't mean new,"I had to go back and check my order to make sure that I purchased this book as ""new"". Because apparently it wasn't. There was a giant crease in the cover and residual glue on the binding. I gave it to my nephew as a holiday gift and he (at 12 yrs old) asked me if I had this in my book shelf or did I borrow it for someone."
1,"FALSE STORIES , IGNORE THIS BOOK","This book is absolutely a compilation of the same lies! ,For example they start an history happening in a desert in Syria !, it happens that I went on vacation to Israel, Egypt, Syria, Jordan and Syria HAS NOT DESERT! The rest of stories are all created by the ""stupid authors"" they should qualify themselves as the worlds Dumbest authors."
2,I disagree,"Reading the reviews already posted, I wonder if I'm listening to the same cd. People have described the voice as mature for someone so young. I find the voice less than ripe enough to have been recorded. The pronounced vibrato, given all sorts of spins by previous writers, is downright annoying. It gives a simpering quality where there should be virility in the emotion. The voice is small, pinched and unheroic. The heaviest role I'd go to see him in would be Almaviva. Listening to the recording as I write, I'm telling you that there is hardly a vowel sung above piano that doesn't quiver. I also hear a sameness throughout. No sense of balance, proportionality. I'm stunned at some of the comparisons that previous writers have suggested, or the prediction, based on this material, that there is greatness to be expected from this singer."
5,A New Star Is Born,"After the sensational debuts at various opera houses in the both Europe and USA, comes the debut solo recital album of the young maltese tenor Joseph Calleja. Many of the items on this disc are from operas Calleja has already sung on stage. His voice is lyrical, Italiante and surprisingly mature for such a young age. He is also a versatile tenor - Calleja colors each aria with an individual mood according to the character he portrays. Macduff's aria `Ah, la paterna mano' brought tears to my eyes. Another touching aria is Federico's lament from L'Arlesiana.I am looking forward for more albums from Calleja."
2,small but powerful,I needed a portable radio for emergencys I didnt know it was this small but it packs some sound its ok for now.
1,AM worked only sometimes (on my radio at least),"FM is bearable (the antenna is too short and the radio itself has poor sensitivity). But AM reception is at best intermittent: the radio suddenly shuts up, then suddenly spits out another blast of sound. Thus for your hearing protection, should you use this ""radio"" for AM, do not crank up the volume and move it closer to your ear when it becomes silent.P.S. For EE-educated readers. During such periods of ""AM silence"", the circuit happily oscillates. By turning power on and off you can stop oscillations (for a while :)."
4,Good Enough,After my first purchase I brought two more. These are to give to low income housing neighbors. The radios work pretty well. But the main thing is that I am showing them that I really care for them - and I am standing by to help them should an emergency occur.
5,heads up,Fit like a glove. Used to be able to buy replacement handles at Home Depot but they no longer carry them. This was a perfect match. Someone had broken the handle and just threw away the whole thing. I hate to see things go to waste so I fished it out of the dumpster and now have another hammer to add to my collection. I might not have life insurance or a 401K but I got me some hammers.
5,User of this product for 10 yrs,"This facial mask is getting more difficult to locate and I'm now buying two tubes at a time! It really is cleansing as you can see when you pull the mask off, revealing all the junk that was stuck in your pores. I have had the unfortunate circumstance of adult acne and after using it, my face is much less inflammed, the redness is gone and my face has a ""dewy-look"" all the next day. I always use it the night before a big day or evening as it leaves my face radiant. Regardless if it does not have the melon and ginseng, it is a fantastic product. I recommend it for teens (that's when I started using it!) as well as adults."
4,Freeman Cucumber Facial Peel-Off Mask,"I've used this product for many years with good results. After using this, my skin always felt cleaner than justing soap and water. Skin felt softer. Pores seemed less noticable. The area stores stopped stocking this producted and I couldn't find it anywhere. I looked when going out of town but never found a store that carried it. They did stock other flavors of this product but never the peel-off mask. Amazon is the only place I've found this producted so I ordered many tubes. It last a long time, easy to use and has always been a good product. Not harsh to the skin as some other products may be. Easy to apply and easy to take off. I received free shipping and handling which is always nice and a big plus."
3,Different formula?,I bought this off of amazon because I couldn't find it anywhere in Walmart or another other supermarkets.I was expecting the same strength of its original formula but this seemed a little weaker and didn't seem to pull off a lot of blackheads like it used to.
1,Waste Of Money,"This product broke me and my mom out. I wouldn't recommend wasting your money on this, especially if you have sensitive skin."
1,Add COLOR to your product!,It works great but impossible to see the clear gel as you apply it so you cannot tell if you covered your face perfectly or not
1,WHAT. THE. HELL.,"I guess I don't know how to use a facial peel off mask or something, but I am not happy. First off, it's like glue. It's the same thing as getting elmers glue, just smells like cucumbers. I can't spread it around to my face and it peels off like glue on your hands. You know when you get glue on your hands and peel it off as a kid? Same thing, except you can't spread it around like Elmer's. It took me forever to get it off my face and was not nice because I have peach fuzz. It got in my hair and I had to wash it out, and I didn't see a difference whatsoever in my face except that it was red from trying to get it all off. If you want a pain in the ass (and I don't like to cuss), buy this. This is something that I would never recommend to anyone whatsoever. If I'm doing it the wrong way, please someone tell me!"
2,Won't peel off,"Loved the smell, loved the clean feeling and hated trying to get it off. It never peeled off . I had to wash it off with water"
3,Don't like the smell,"This product is good overall, but I really don't like the artificial smell of it. I think it would have been fine if it were fresh cucumber kind of smell or even unscented. Also, the peeling could get a little annoying at times especially around the eyebrows and also near my hair. Maybe I should just avoid those spots but then I always have blemishes near those spots and I would like to cover them."
3,Ehh.,"The smell is gross and gave me a headache but it does work. Not sure if I would repurchase this one, maybe a different a scent."
1,"The ""polished"" face peel","I have been using the cucumber face peel for quite some time before they took it off the shelves at the store, only to replace it with another kind of face peel by Freeman. I dont advise any one to use this product. When I started to use it, it left a shadow on my face from where I peeled it off. Its different from what I was use to using, and I will never use it again. The older version of the Cucumber melon ginseng face peel is what I strongly advise you to use if you want beautiful skin, and a beautiful complexion. I was happy to learn that I could order the same face peel on line, that I was use to. I thought I was out of luck when several stores that I went to for this product said they didnt cary it any more. But, I finally found it!! Try ""beautiful face"" by Freeman Cucumber Melon Ginseng face peel. ( not the one that says ""polished"")"
5,Simply Amazing!,I am actually wearing the peel as I'm writing this right now. I absolutely love it. I've been using it for a few months now and have not had one complaint. I actually stumbled upon this product by chance at a local CVS. My husband and I were looking for new facial cleansers because nothing in the past has worked for either of us. So after going up and down the aisles I came across this product and decided to give it a shot. I have to say since day 1 after peeling off the mask my skin feels so refreshed. It's literally feels like a weighted layer has been lifted. I use this product at night and the next day my skin feels so smooth and clean. No excess oil when I wake up and my skin doesn't flake as it normally does on my forehead especially. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.
5,Life changing :-),"I started using Freeman's peel off two months ago, when my face was somewhat broken out. 3-4 times a week in the beginning....OUCH! Yes the first few times I got it gooped in my eyebrows. You kind of get the hang of it?It has dramatically made a differance in my skins clarity, so so so wonderful!!!I follow with clinique redness relief lotion-- fabulous!"
1,Stinky Product,"When I used this product for the first time, I was tearing. The smell was really annoying. This mask is feels like glue and apparently has no effect on cleaning pores. Totally waste of money."
4,Cool product,"Great product! The only issues I have are that the mask is clear so it's hard to see where you've put it on your face and also that if you don't put it on thick enough, it's hard to peel off. But if you apply it thickly and around your entire face it peels off in one mask quite easily. It acts like a giant pore strip for your entire face which I love since dirt and oil get stuck in my pores. I will definitely buy more of this product!"
2,No safety seal,"There was no safety seal on this product and it seemed like a good amount of the gel was missing. I am not pleased to have received a product that seems used. Maybe it was just me since no one else seemed to complain about it, but there being no foil or anything doesn't bod well with me. I wont go as far as to give it one star since I don't know if this has happened before. But I am certainly not happy."
4,Not too bad,"I love this peeling mask. I can no longer purchase it at my local drugstore but now i know where it is i am psyched...this product is nice and fun, but one bad thing is i find my face oily after using it but it gets all that dead skin off especially the ones near the nose corner area....different people, different results it is just a hit and miss and something you would not mind missing because it is not too expensive"
2,hmph,"The picture of the product is not what came in the mail. However, what I received smells heavenly and sometimes I'll use the product just for the smell 'cause the mask surely doesn't remove blackheads or anything, really. The mask isn't enough like glue. It's more like weak latex."
5,Renewal Mask,"I think the cucumber PEEL-OFF MASK is a wonderful product. You know how when you first get up in the morning your face, well mine, needs a little wake me up call. Well, for me, the Freeman cucumber peel-off mask is just what the doctor ordered. After a gentle morning face wash, applying the Freeman peel-off mask, then around twenty minutes later my face looks and feels totally refreshed and I feel younger. I am glad that I found this product. I would recommend this product for everyone!!!!"
4,Strong Scent but Works Well,"I have no concerns about the seller - not sure if I would order the product again...very strong scent and I prefer the DHC peel-off mask (which may have been discontinued).After using this product a few times - I must admit that it works well, you just have to be okay with a strong scent of cucumber on your face for a while! If the DHC peel-off mask has been discontinued, I would purchase this product again (upon further consideration)."
5,Love it!,"I just moved from the west coast to the east coast. When I ran out of it, i couldn't find it anywhere! I'm so thankful that it was available on Amazon. My pores thank you too."
4,had it used it,"I like this mask. I don't know how efficient it with pulling off dead skin cells and all, it doesn't feel sticky enough. I mean it stays and peels, but I think I would like something that I can literally feel that it works.Skin after use still feels nice, but generally due to the fact that she mask also takes excess oils. Which is nice. I would recommend using it just because it gives you a good clean feeling. But does it work on dead skin cells ? ...."
1,don't waste your $,My 35lb lab mix destroyed this in less than a minute. its made of cheap rubber and any dog big enough to get it in their mouth will easily destroy it.
3,thought the squeaker would last longer,"After my dog got over all the pokey bumps, he loved the toy ball. Wish I could find a product that would survive the jaws of a German Shepard. The squeaker stopped working within a week as was the ball was punctured. My dog still loves to play with it though."
2,"Lindsay, what happened?","I am a long time Lindsay McKenna fan and have read all of the Morgan's Mercenaries series in addition to anything else she writes. I hope this one was ghost written. First off, after the first chapter, we all know the heroine thinks she is unattractive. It doesn't need to be restated again and again and again - especially in such a lame way with him saying he's attracted and her saying she's couldn't possibly attract him.... This series is usually about men and women dedicated to their jobs (serving their country), willing to sacrafice everything. In this book however, they are flirting etc. while folks are dead and dying in the rubble."
5,The Road to Ensenada,This CD is fast becoming my Favorites of Mr.Lovett's music stirring and thoughtful lyrics along with great composition leaves the listener with a real TEXAS feel.
4,Oh Lawd is this Good,"When I lived in Couer d'Alene, my uncle and I would play this album all the time. In fact he had almost all of Lyle's music and I instantly became a fan and once again Amazon came through as I bought two of his CDs for a total of $10 but it's this album with its cool sarcastic wit and little guitar twang that gets me.I put it on for a pal of mine and she thought I had lost my mind but by the end she was loving it - a duet with Randy Newman on ""Long Tall Texan"" (""ooh lordy is you the law?"") and the hilarious yet serious ""Don't Touch My Hat"" (""you can have my girl but don't touch my hat); this album proves why he has had a revered career beyond just the average country performer. Plus I just read that Liz Phair includes this as one of her favorite albums."
4,"Not his best, but...","A far, far better album than I LOVE EVERYBODY, though it still lacks some of the character of his first four. I miss the wry, sittin' on the back porch, maybe life's not so bad humor."
5,The Road to Ensenada,"The first time I ever heard Lyle Lovett's music was on VH1's Storytellers. Much to my surprise, not only did I like his music but I really enjoyed HIM! He was so funny! Dry but fun!At that moment, I was hooked. Lyle's songwriting style is something I haven't heard in a long time. He writes/tells stories rather than formulaic songs (i.e. 1st verse, 2nd verse, chorus, 3rd verse, bridge, chorus, repeat).I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM! And try to sit tight to hear the bonus track, ""The Girl in the Corner."" It starts about 4 1/2 minutes after the last song is over. ""The Girl in the Corner"" is the song that Mr. Lovett sold me on."
5,Another Excellent CD,"I am starting to become a real Lyle Lovett fan, after having just purchased twpo of hisCD's. They are both high quality, and most enjoyable to listen to over and ovver again."
5,come on baby are my favorite words...,"I have this best friend named Dawn. I bought her this album for Christmas because I wanted it for myself. She likes Lyle but understood right away that this was a gift to me through her. It lives in permanent rotation in my CD player in my car. Dawn and I go out all the time and as soon as she gets in the car she hunts down this CD and blasts ""One Eyed Fiona."" The whole album is a treat - but ""One-Eyed"" is a great song. It's a treat of an album by this great man with a great band. Buy it, put it in your car CD and next time your best friend hops in, blast this album."
3,Interesting but nothing to write home about.,I am a fan of Lyle Lovett but was not impressed with this album. I have found that some albums do grow on you over time but have not experienced that with this album.
1,Real Texas Boogie Throwdown,"You know what's neat about this album? The cover is black and white. I love that. It makes it look more artistic. Its also neat that they cut off the top of Lyle Lovett's head, but that you can still tell its him. That REALLY adds to the artistry. Finally the fact that he's holding a cowboy hat is the icing on the cake...it signals me, the buyer, very clearly that this is a well-thought out, highly artistic album that has something, I don't really know or care exactly what, to do with country or folk or something. And I need all those signals too because I really am not that knowledgable when it comes to music. It's just so much work to find things to listen to. I especially don't want to listen to anything old or scary looking! Yuck-o!!! No, this'll do nicely. Sure it doesn't really make me feel anything and its not really saying anything, but its really nice to listen to while I drive my Tahoe and drink coffee!"
4,Very Good,"I agree with one reviewer who said, ""Lovett is simply one of the best American singer-songwriters extant, whether playing raconteur, philosopher king, or wounded romantic."" Songs like ""Fiona"" and ""Promises"" are gems. It's nice to have such an independent singer-songwriter in our midst. He has nobody's style but his own, and this is very refreshing!"
3,Sergeant Murphy's Day Off review,The only bad thing about TBWORS series is it got cancaled before I got a chance to watch it on tv. The show itself is harmless enough and not dark at all. The episodes are pretty good and nice. I give this tape a 7 out of 10.
5,Why isn't it on DVD,"This isn't an actual review because I don't think there's really much to say about Night of Abandon other than it's great, excellent, fantastic and the best episodes of the Red Shoe Diaries. My question is why aren't the Best of the Red Shoe Diaries on dVD yet?"
4,Carnaval in Rio! Who needs more?,"Red Shoe Diaries 08 -- Night of AbandonBeing repetitive, because in some respects the same can be said of every Red Shoe Diaries story, if you want eye-candy alone, go elsewhere and enjoy. If you want eye-candy (always), mind-candy (often), skilled actors (always) and easy-to-hear music, try one. Then try to stay out of bed.The first story, Night of Abandon, is set at Carnaval in Rio de Janeiro. If you need more than that, try this: a woman who'd suppressed fantasy in her life finds it, thanks to her grandmother.In Liar's Tale, the second story, a woman tries a bit of deceit to achieve her goal but reaches her level of incompetence.In the third story, In the Blink of an Eye, a ""poor girl"" who'd married for money finds her marriage unfulfilling but isn't prepared for the violence that maintains it."
1,Blah,"Blah, blah, blah- a waste of time and money. We did not even watch the whole thing. Don't waste your time on this."
3,Good mascara,"I had higher hopes, but all-in-all it is a good mascara. Not as smudgeproof as was claimed, but it'll do."
4,Just what I wanted,Mascara is good and doesn't flake off. Would have liked a curved brush but works well. Would order it again.
2,Not for me,"Sorry, but this is just not a good Mascara. It dries really fast as you apply causing clumps. I wanted to like it so bad because of the reviews but. For me, it's a dud."
4,Different since it's release a couple years ago,"The game has changed a LOT since the initial release.A few changes to note:it is easier to solo now than it was a while back. You CAN solo all the way to level cap. Just avoid the mobs made for group combat.The game is easier. Perhaps too streamlined compared to old EQ. You don't get the same feeling of accomplishment and discovery as you did in EQ1.A few spells have been removed from some of the classes and placed into others for balancing.The begining tutorials could use some more involvement.All in all, Fun but still far from perfect and definatly worth a look. Try it before you buy all the expansions."
4,Beautiful Designed!!!! Memories of EQ 1!!!,"DoF is definately a top notch expansion to EQ II. It's has good and bad parts too as stated previously though. It is a zone for 40th plus characters (but not just expansion for hard core gamers as previously stated) and I am not going to say that it is easy to get there but me and my wife took awhile to get our characters above that level...but I will say if you want faster xp to level grab a partner....most ppl who complain about slow xp are soloing ALL the time...why did you buy a MULTIPLAYER game then if you want to solo....lol...The elements of DoF are definately worth getting to 40th though....beautiful graphics and sounds....desert that has sand blowing....music is beautiful too..overall added up 60th level....more quests, and even more beautifully designed creatures."
3,It's EQ2.... whoo hoo??,"Added lots of nice new content to the game. Got stale for me after awhile, the whole EQ2 thing, not just this expansion. I got really peeved at their expansion every couple months, plus Bonus packs, plus this plus that..... You pay a monthly fee already, yet they drain your wallet even more for add ons every other month or so....."
4,Blue Ridge Koi & Goldfish Pellet Foot,"Good price, the fish eat it but the description did not indicate it is floating. I needed sinking. Otherwise, seems fine."
3,Okay,"While these raisins are perfectly fine, I don't really detect a big difference between these and the red boxes from the grocery store. I did think they seemed to have more of a sugar like substance on the outside of the raisin, kind of reminding me of raisins that come in the bran cereal. My four year old didn't like these, I thought they were okay, and my husband thought they were really good. They are okay, but I doubt I'll order again."
5,Excellent,"Excellent product, very delicious. Everyone in the house loves it, will definately be ordering more in the future.Very satisfied from the product."
2,Very wordy.,Author liked to use a lot of words and is quite repetitive. Promotes a lot of her previous writings withinher books but her approach is different.
4,"Philosophy, cosmology, and transpersonal psychology","Esoteric Astrology is not very much about astrology in the conventional sense. It is really a book of esoteric philosophy, cosmology, and psychology in the transpersonal sense. It is about the ""Ageless Wisdom"" and part of a large body of work dealing with the many facets of that subject. It does bear a resemblance to other astrology texts in that it includes a substantial essay on each of the twelve zodiacal signs, but these are treated in terms of the above sub-notes of esoteric philosophy, cosmology, and transpersonal psychology. The binding theme of all this is the seven rays, that is the zodiacal signs, planets, and their various relations are elaborated as expressions of seven fundamental energies or archetypical forces that are seen as the causative and creative energies underling all manifestation from the cosmic to the human. Esoteric Astrology is about the evolution of the spiritual life of humanity and the universe."
3,"my oh my, have times have changed",I had one of these pet barriers about 5 years ago when my pups were learning to ride in a car and needed to learn to stay in the back. It was very sturdy and durable. I bought this one (same brand) and the quality is much different then my first one. The tubing is flimsy and when putting it together for the first time one of the pieces broke. I don't know if this one will last as long as my other one but its the only one I can find that actually works for my vehicle. Very disappointed that the manufacturer decided to make it flimsy.
2,No Thanks!,"I have been in construction for nearly 15 years now and have tried many hammers. I received this one as a gift and loved my 14 oz. Stiletto with the hickory handle, so I figured I would love this one as well. Not so, after two months I got tennis elbow so bad I couldn't hold a can of soda, ended up having to get a cortisone shot to releave the pain. Stick with the 14 oz. titanium with the hickory handle. I have had that hammer for 5 years now and still have the original handle on it."
5,bad shoulder?,If your getting old and your shoulders are not what they used to be. or if you like power with little weight. This is the hammer for you. By far the best Hammer I ever used. I bought my first one 6 years ago. It was recently stolen so I had to buy another. Interchangable head is priceless. This will be the last Hammer you ever buy.
4,Singing hammer,"I recently purchased this tool and find it to be a very good product. My only complaint is an annoying ""ping"" upon contact with a nail. For almost two hundred dollars, I do not want my hammer to ""sing"" all day long while driving nails. It is easy on the elbow and wrist and does drive nails very well. My 12 hammers I own in my remodeling business still get more use than the TiBone. I am thinking of selling it after only one day of use. I have not tried the smooth face head so I can only report that the milled face head makes the ping noise. I have emailed manufacturer about this but have received a reply."
4,Stiletto,"I like the Tibone hammmer, been a carpenter for 15 years, mostly formwork, the only drawback I have found is the rubber handle is splitting, Will have to figure something out"
3,"Proper weight, not space age design.","I find that Stiletto is a lot of hype. As for the whole driving force, is a bunch of BS! I literally have to swing this hammer faster and harder than my tradition 25 oz hickory handle. The fact is if you have elbow pain you are either A: using the wrong weight or B: not utilizing pneumatic nailers. Most of the time its ""A"" cause of tough guy egos. ""I can pound a 16d in one swing with my 30 oz framer."" Yeah, after work you rub your elbow and complain of pain. You should be spending the $250 on a nail gun or new style palm nailer. Work smarter, not harder. I am giving this an extra star for the magnetic nail set and face change features. Otherwise, I would give the stiletto 2 stars."
2,what's all the money for?,"this is a cool looking hammer, and i own it. but i use a estwing and i'll tell ya, i like the estwing way better.the nail puller is fine, but, i am not a little woosie that needs a patented nail puller because it hurts my skinny little wrists. i don't like the fact that i have to keep checking the changable face to make sure it's on tight. because if you need to replace it, that's 35 bucks plus shipping. thats more than my estwing costs for the whole hammer. i know i don't have money to burn,do you?"
3,"Not bad, but not great.","My last set of sheets were 800 thread count and they are much softer. These aren't horrible, but I was expecting better. They do not feel like sateen sheets."
4,Nice guide,"This is a nice guide for a newbie, for the wanna be pro, and for the top pro. I recommend it, but it lacks some more fine explanation and guidance, in terms of what we eat, how much we sleep, etc... basic performance stuff. Also, it gives us a lot of workouts, witch is very good, but it's more fitted to a person who has 4 hours to work out everyday, not 1."
3,Okay book,"This book has many, many exercises to do - too many. I really wanted exercises that specifically would help with surfing. This is more of an overall get in shape book with some stuff specific to improve surfing."
5,Great Reading,"I thought these book reviews would help me form opinions on a presentation I have to give on the meaning of the physical letter ""A"" but after reading almost all of them, I felt inclined to add my opinion. (the book review helped a little, but I didn't really expect anyone to have written exactly what I was looking for anyway) I have to admit, I didn't expect the book to be exciting or great by the looks of the Custom House, which my AP English teacher actually had us skip. But once you get into it and promise yourself that you're not going to stop reading, you become involved in the story and you really get a deep understanding of human nature. Overall, I found the themes and symbols in this book depressing but with a large amount of depth. I would advise all of the readers who think little of the book to reread it with better expectations on what Hawthorne has to say, and to ignore the fact that the sentences are long- they will flow easily if only you immerse yourself in the novel."
5,BEAUTIFUL!,"I tried reading this once before and thought it would be depressing. I then tried to read it again and succeeded. It is definitely worth reading if you love books. I didn't expect it to be a love story, but it really was. What Hester and Mr. Dimmesdale did was wrong, but they were repentant. Hester should not have suffered like she did. The writing was so beautiful and turned the story from something generic into something truly beautiful."
5,the real midwest,"It is nice, no, a relief, to see a small town NOT completely inhabited by ""quirky"" characters, and teenagers hanging at the 7-11, waiting to make their escape. And also not to have to endure a picture of the supposed 1950s hokey midwest of all potluck suppers and helping each other when the barn burns down. I salute Beginner's Luck for having people that are no more weird or normal than anywhere else, though in the family where Hallie takes up residence the matriarch could definitely be considered eccentric or bohemian, though ""politically active"" is probably a better description. Anyway, I enjoyed this book immensely. It's a refreshing break from what's out there in almost every way. The tone is upbeat and it leaves you smiling and wanting more. I know my friends will like it and that's why they'll be getting a copy for Christmas."
5,"a good laugh, to go",I recently flew abroad and brought a copy of Beginner's Luck. The flight went by so quickly-it was a delightful read. only problem is my constant outbursts of laughter were quite disturbing to the other passengers. Buy this book and tuck it in your suitcase for your next vacation--or start your vacation early and read the book now!
5,Loved it!,"This genre of book (coming of age, quirky, etc.) can be tedious but this was truly delightful. Characters, setting, so nice. Lots of laughs out loud."
5,A Great Surprise!,"I've been a member of a book club for over 15 years and I have never had such pleasant surprise of a book in all that time. Another member suggested the book and frankly, I was somewhat reluctant to partake because I had seen the Amazon review from a Reader in Austin, Tx's and the comments about Why bother? That reviewer says nothing happens, etc. And she's right. If you're waiting for the big car chase or the big explosion, it's not going to happen. But if you want to be sucked into the lives terrific, loveable, quicky characters, this is a must read!! I had a hard time putting it down and I hope Ms. Pedersen writes a sequel because I'm dying to know what happens in the next stage of all these characters' lives."
4,You'll Love This BooK Too,"Ashleigh's Dairy is a book in a series about a young girl who LOVES horses. I like action, excitement and emotional books. If you do too you won't be able to stop reading. This is a reasonable book for ages 9-12. It is not too long but not too short. I highly recommend it. It does not give any pictures of the characters but it does give a picture of the author at the end, which I like because you can get an idea of what she looks like. This is a wonderfully written piece of literature."
5,Holy Crow!!!!,"THIS IS THE BEST BOOK IN THE SERIES BY FAR!!! I loved this book. I cried through the end ( When Black Night died I cried so bad I couldn't even see the page. ) I read it last night and couldn't put it down. I ended up reading 'til 11:00. When I put this book down I said to myself ""AShleigh is a very strong girl"" I LOVED IT!!! Bring some tissues when you read, I'm warning you. Every horse Lover should read this book!!"
5,This book goes in the history!,"Oh my god! Did I really cry at the end? It's soooo good that I read it for the whole afternoon, not knowing what time it is. It's so exciting, sad, happiness, upsetting and full of surprises all at once! As for you ""A reader from USA, February 14,1999, This book is terrible,"" you are being disrespectful of horses and young ladies. It's just not your taste. Anyway this book is really amazing. I felt bad for Mona when Frisky was still stolen and Ashleigh got her horses back. I was full of concern for Jolita (1st mare to suffer from the diease) when Ashleigh found very stiffed legged. I felt happiness whenever Ashleigh was happy. I wished that the Griffens could buy only Stardust for Ashleigh. Joanna, did Ashleigh mentioned that Stardust was doing four foot fences at nineteen? You said that the pair jumped a foot, when WE said that they jumped 4-foot log. I don't know if I can bear to read that book again....."
3,have the tissues ready,This is an ok. I found it really sad. The diary format would have been ok otherwise. Tissues should be clo9se by when you read this.
5,It was a very well thought out book (bring tissues!),"I have read the whole series, and even though Stardust clears a 4-foot jump without training, I'll say that this is a very well written book. It answers many questions about Ashleigh's past, and is extremely sad. Bring a box of tissues when you read this book!"
5,The Unforgetable story.............,I LOVED this book! i read all the TB books i have at least 17x each or more! this book was sooooooo sad. i cried at the end. every time i read it i cried. then fianlly i relized hey it's fiction. i still cry to this day when ever i read this book.
4,"great going,joanna!","I think this book was to,well,unrealistic.I mean it's sad,and all,but not ALL those bad things could have happened.all in all,it was okay."
1,This book is terrible,"A very bad book, that is very boring. All it really talks about is a little girl, and horses"
5,Great power supply,"This power supply is working perfectly for me. It is a very well made product and it comes with all the cables you might need for a gaming rig. You can power two GTX 285 as it has 4 connectors for video cards. It also comes with a new 8pin power connector for newer video cards (I guess).At the end of the day, I would recommend it."
3,Question & Answer,"While I think this book is an incredible anthology of hispanic writers, The question and answer sections at the end of the chapters, to me, seem quite difficult to figure out, but I am keeping in mind, that I'm not a completely fluent reader!I would recommend this book"
4,Voces de Hispanoamerica,"Was in very good condition. Took two and a half weeks to arrive though. Other than the arrival time, everything was wonderful. Had no writing or marks on the inside or outside."
5,Great Condition!,The book I ordered was delivered quickly and in the condition as promised. I have no complaints and definitely recommend this seller.
5,This brush has transformed my head!,"I have short, baby fine, stick straight hair that has no life at all. The back of my head is completely flat, and the front has total forward growth. If I don't do my hair right, I look like some kind of medieval serf (trust me you don't want to know). The bristles of this brush are long and spread out so they can pick up and twirl short hair, while the hot barrel sets the curl. With this brush I actually can have some poof in the back, and I can style the front and sides so they look perky and natural. Most other brushes have too many bristles so they don't get down to the scalp to pick up at the roots. The small barrel is perfect for short hair."
3,A Mixed Bag,"Let me first say that I enjoyed the story, the characters, and the plot. I read this book on my Kindle and the most distracting thing was the constantly variable font size. Paragraph after paragraph jumped back and forth between different size fonts. Distracting, but not disruptive to the story.A well crafted plot of mob infiltration of the PGA tour. The author wrapped up all events well and left no unresolved issues . . . other than his marriage to his fiancee. The common current day premise - let's just live together for a few years and see how we like it -- as his escape from decision time. Hence Jack Austin's (the protagonist) character lived his personal life the same way as his professional career. Scoring well, remaining above the ""cut"" but never winning.I would read another novel by this author, as his voice is quite good and the story entertaining. Plus I have never won a PGA tour event either."
3,Skillful Mystery,"Intrigue, pacing, suspense, well-organized plot, a dyslexic sleuth, and a love affair in jeopardy--all make this mystery a thrilling read, fast and entertaining. Especially strong are the skillful dialogue and thick description that give the novel a cinematic quality. The ending suggests more to come about these characters. I suspect a bright future for this author. If I were a fan of mysteries, thrillers, or golf (which I am not), I might give this a higher rating. But I don't know the genre, and thus I don't know how to compare it. Alas,Amazon wouldn't let me submit the review without a rating."
2,Extremely disappointing...,I surely did not see the same movie that the other reviewers seen. This was nothing more than flat-out bad and a total waste of time.
5,A Complete Course in Physics,"Most comprehensive text on physics seen to date. Excellent reference on virtually any area of physics. Deffinitely not an introductory text, but intended for those with a fairly solid background in mathematics and physics, ie. scientists, engineers or the very serious amateur. Plentiful photos, charts, diagrams and supporting reference material. A must for anyone employed in this field or with a keen interest in physics."
4,Not too shabby...,"Well, I'd have to say that BNL's latest album is not altogether that bad. 'Pinch Me', and 'Tonight is the night I fell asleep at the wheel' are my instant favorites-- They sound BNLish from the Stunt era(another good album...). The hidden track is one definately to be heard-- it has an unmistakeable Beatles feel to it that I definately enjoyed. The remainder of the songs are a bit deeper than the rest of the BNL repirtoir, Conventioneers is a good track. This album is especially good if you like listening to Steven. If you like the sound of Ed more(kinda like I do, but they're all great-- every single one of them...), Stunt and Rock Spectacle are the albums for you more than this one, but then again, you never know."
3,where's ED?!,"hello all you BNL fans out there. i must say that i am not a die hard BNL fan, since i only got into them when their last album came out (for that you might call me a bit of a ""sell out"" fan). nonetheless, i thought ""stunt"" was the best album of '98! and i greatly anticipated the release of their follow up, but i must say that ""maroon"" is somewhat weak. first & foremost, WHERE'S ED?!? he only sings lead on two songs, which are the best of the album (i guess i just like his voice better.). but even still this album doesn't have the cohesive ""team effort"" feel (especially with regard to vocals) between Paige and Robertson that ""stunt"" did. although ""conventioneers"" is hilarious, ""maroon"" also doesn't live up to the witty humor of its predecessor. all in all, i could've downloaded the 2 ed songs off of napster and been just as happy!"
3,Yikes!!!,"Oh my gosh! I was so looking forward to this CD, as I am a huge BNL fan, but I was sorely disappointed in just about everything on it. True, I still think Gordon was their finest work, with a most wonderful and eclectic group of songs, but all of their CD's since then have had their own merits. I just think the songs on Maroon all sound like they came out of the same piece - the lyrics were good, but the music was just too much of the same. I was listening for a song that makes me smile like When I Was Born or My Life in a Nutshell, but it just wasn't there. Maybe the guys did rush to get this out - the last time I saw them in concert, back in December, they looked exhausted. I'm giving it three stars simply because anything they do is at least somewhat special, and there is a great picture of them finally! So fellas? Take your time, go back to being your own funky selves (please don't go mainstream on us!) and I'll look forward to your NEXT CD! See you on the road!"
4,Cool lyrics.,"The sound is absolutely great, the music is good also but i wont say this is a must have. i give it 4 stars, it's good but not excellent. some lyrics are cool."
2,"Not bad, but Nothing like they were","After hearing this CD, I was very disappointed. Not that it was a bad CD, it just lacked the BNL touch that the actual fans have come to love. It lacked the energy and the all around silliness. Most importantly, it was missing ED! Ed only had about 3 track that he actually had lead vocals, or a duet with Steve. For those of you who just listened to BNL because of Stunt, by all means buy this CD. But, for the real fans, don't waste your money."
2,A good thought gone bad,"I thought great, my favorite band a new album. It seems that Stunt was very catchy Gordon has a nice rough feel and Rock Spectacle is energetic and EXTREMELY CATCHY. This seems more professional and seems that they put less into it. I really was dissapointed. When I bought this I loved a few tracks but the rest are terrible. I then went and bought Gordon.I would have given this three stars if this album did not seem to go extremely downhill from Gordon. Rock Spectacle remains my favorite and I wish this would be."
1,i can't stand this band...,"I always thought these guys were terrible...and my roommate plays this new one all the time...and it confirmed my theory. these guys don't have too much creativity in their songwriting. this record is just more of the same old, same old terrible BNL crap."
4,A wonderful follow-up to mega hit 'Stunt',"Barenaked Ladies 'Maroon' is a great follow-up to the mega smash album 'Stunt'. With songs of all different sorts, most centering around feel good pop or quirky ballads, it's easy to see why success has taken this group so far. The tracks are very good, though I must say that my favorites were 'Never Do Anything', 'Pinch Me', 'Conventioneers', 'Helicopters', and 'Tonight is the Night I Fell Asleep at the Wheel'.It features wonderful vocals, most by Steven in lead. With the same subtle genius of the lyrics on 'Stunt', the Barenaked Ladies are on full-force with this album. Though it falls a bit short of the aforementioned album, it is still a must own for any BNL fan!"
4,More subdued but still got that BNL sound,"I adore Pinch Me, The Night I Fell Asleep at the Wheel, and the bonus track. This doesn't have the hyperactive stuff that you might expect after One Week, but I still really enjoy this CD."
4,"Just a little more serious, and that&#65533;s a good thing","Maroon seems to be turning point for BNL. The songs still have that quirky pop sound, and occasional flashes of humor are found throughout, but the humor is tinged with a touch of the bittersweet. Each song makes a case for the band's maturation, and as the lyrical complexity builds, the sound continues to be true to the band's earlier music. Not to say the CD is depressing. It just seems the band is trying to balance that ""fun"" side with a little more depth of feeling, and they are succeeding. As far as the last song, does anyone remember the band Bloodrock?"
5,Wow!,"The Barenaked Ladies' latest album shows them effortlessly mixing laugh-filled tracks with serious muses on life. From the laugh out loud ""Go Home"" to the tear-jerking ""Tonight Is the Night I Fell Asleep At the Wheel,"" their talent is amazing. Their ability to play with your emotions is remarkable (just listen to track 12). Their first single, ""Pinch Me,"" is an example of just one of their many musical styles."
4,The Quality Just Keeps On Comming,"These guys are real talents. Whereas at the moment I can not rate this CD on the same level as Stunt, it definitely showcases that these guys now how to write and arrange some clever songs. They even expand on to some new styles on Hidden Sun, Conventioneers, Sell Sell Sell, and The Night I Fell Asleep At The Wheel. However, there are plenty of good rock and acoustic driven numbers which establish a focal point for the band. Where the lyrics are unusual, its not like the band is going totally off the wall. They stay in touch with the present times and show some badly needed wit which is definitely lacking in todays music. For the moment it gets a 4 1/2 star rating but in could easily rate a five after a few more listens."
5,Excellent follow-up,"Thank goodness BNL didn't follow with a Stunt II. They instead created an excellent eclectic album. Maybe their best ever. This album contains a great mix of songs and some experimentation with some instruments previously not heard on their earlier albums. Although Kevin Hearn played on their last album, his talent is really utilized on this album. They sound great and my only disappointment is that didn't use the leftover songs from the Maroon sessions to make a double album."
3,Kinda dissapointed.....,"I haven't been a BNL fan for a long time, but I was rabid about their landmark album ""Stunt"" for their brilliant mix of acoustic and distorted guitars, various time signatures, superb, darkly ironic lyrics and vocals. ""Maroon"" does not live up to ""Stunt"" because I find that the hard-edged guitars have been turned down and melodically the songs are not as catchy as on ""Stunt"". The lyrics on ""Maroon"" are not as darkly humorous and I feel are too poppy without the irony. ""Maroon"" is listenable however and I find a few good songs like ""Pinch Me"", ""Never Do Anything"", ""Falling For The First Time"", but overall I'd rather let ""Stunt"" play on in my CD player....at least I can play it all the way through unlike ""Maroon""."
5,A very well constructed album,"The ladies new album is a absoulte delight for old time fans of the ladies, and even for the new ones. The song caries a familiar feel to it, while also providing a touch of difference as any band would provide in a new album. One song of note that is particullary good, but also probably the saddest song i've ever heard is the last track, ""Tonight is the Night i feel asleep at the wheel."" More than once i have shed a tear while listening to this song. I would strongly recommend this album, its truely a great one."
5,They've done it again,"I didn't think it was possible to top my favorite BNL album Maybe you Should Drive, but they did it. I've been a fan of BNL ever since they first hit the scene with Gordon. I've followed them through Maybe you Should Drive, Born on a Pirate, and even on the least ""BNL like"" album, Stunt. This one surpasses all the rest though. With a excellent blend of melodical beats and harmonized melodies, this cd is truely the best of the best."
3,Better than Stunt...,"To me, Stunt was an enjoyable CD by a band that has become one of my favorites, but not their shining moment (Rock Spectacle and Born on a Pirate Ship remain at the top of my list). Unfortunately, Maroon falls into the same category. I like it better than Stunt (mainly because Stunt was played to death on the radio), but it still makes me want to listen to Pirate Ship. All of the trademarks of a BNL cd are here....hooks galore, a wink/wink sense of humor...and the band has also taken a step towards more mature song writing. But too often the songs sound like schmaltzy pop songs designed to maximize radio play. Its not that they're not good, they're just not on the same level as ""Brian Wilson"" or ""Jane"" or ""Shoe Box"". If you're a BNL fan, you're going to like it. If you're a fan of Stunt, go dig up a copy of Rock Spectacle."
4,Why did we wait so long?,"The Barenaked Ladies are certainly keeping up with themselves. This latest of five albums has solidified their place in the future of rock and role, and my CD rack. My only question is, why did it take those of us in the U.S. so long to catch on to this differntly wondeful band? I joined the craze at Rock Spectacle and have been a big fan ever since. It is a shame that the American airwaves are not buzzing with some of their earlier songs, particularly ""Break Your Heart,"" and ""Be My Yoko Ono."" If you like music at all, this is a must own...actually, they all are!"
2,Letdown,"With this CD, the Vanillazation of BNL is complete. I'm glad the album has been getting rave reviews, but if you are a long-time fan of the band, you might be let down by their latest. The group has abandoned their distinctive sound and now blend in with the bland bands that seem to get at least one song per album on the radio these days."
4,Stunt Like Album and Sound,"Maybe the fans rushed BNL a bit to get another album out and in the stores. While the sound remains BNL's, the subject matter is a carry over or repeat from Stunt. I am an old Gordon and Maybe You Should Drive fan. Most of the Maroon songs could appear on Stunt or may even be tracks they did not use on that album. I personally would have liked them to take a year off and then do another album with some new sounds and stories like we got with Gordon, Stunt etc. To many artist today seem to be in the quantity mode instead of quality mode. But anyway, I am still a BNL supporter.For those who have not seen them in concert you need to, they sound great and act great. Nothing fancy but pure BNL."
3,"On the shelf, pull out for a memory","This album is nothing special, it's a fun summer album if you feel like bopping around in your car on a drive to the beach, but it isn't much other than that. This album sounds like a pot roast of Hootie and the Blowfish, Blues Traveler, and They Might be Giants, only cooked at the wrong temperature and with the wrong spices. They Might Be Giants can pull off the crazy use of ridiculous sounds and instruments as well as funny lyrics, but The Barenaked Ladies need to practice it more before putting it on an album. The ""funny"" songs aren't good enough musically to even bother listening to, they simply turn into filler songs.Anyways ""Pinch Me"" has always been a summer time fav of mine."
5,Multi-layed Masterpiece,"Is it just me or is ""The night I fell asleep at the wheel"" one of the most amazing songs ANY group has ever put out? Every time I listen to this album (and I've listened to it alot), I hear something new and interesting. Its unlikely that the album will win many converts over to BNL because its only getting limited air-play, but its a real treat for all of BNLs fans who didn't know what to expect after Stunt."
4,They'll Never Be the Same,"When I first listened to Maroon I didn't particulary like it that much, except for the first four songs which are all great. ""Of the Hook"" and ""Hidden Sun"" are both great. This album took about three days to get me hooked. I don't think any BNL fan should be dissapointed, although there are always the exceptions. They're the same ones who didn't like Stunt at first. However, I enjoy listening to the album except for ""Sell, Sell, Sell"". I just can't get it. Anyway this album is sure to be one of may favorites and I hope they don't break up anytime soon."
3,"Great band, Disappointing CD","As a huge fan of BNL I waited with baited breath for the new release. Maybe it was the long wait or the hype associated with it but when I got it home and listened I was somewhat disappointed. Tracks like Pinch Me, while reckoning back to childhood days (""Turn the sprinkler on the lawn, run through with my gym shorts on) ala Grade 9 never fail to bring a smile to my face but the album as a whole seemed lacking in spirit/soul. Regardless the band still ranks in my top 5 favorite bands of all times."
5,"As always a little crazy, a little smooth",Well I was very happy when I listened to the new cd and found some of the crazy lyrics and imaginative tunes that are heard in the early albums. This is definitly a great follw-up album but should also be looked at seperatly as a great mixing of all types of music. I think (as always) that BNL is great and anyways who else could make a song about senior citizens in love or sleeping at the wheel with such ingenuity!
3,"Some good, some weak: Maroon not bad, but rather spotty.","Maroon delivered on several occasions, providing whimsical and eclectic lyrics to accompany a variety of situations. Unfortunately, it was not as strong as 'Stunt' or my favourite album 'Born on a Pirate Ship.' Though tracks one, two, three, and five are classic BNL, the rest doesn't quite deliver the same way previous BNL albums do."
4,Don't Break My Heart 2002 [ CD-Single],Safire is the Bomb! I am so happy to see her back on the Dance seen. She has great talent and the productions on the mixes are phat! I am going to get the album next !
3,"Good pictures, standard info","Although he mentions consultants that he used from every section of the country, only one of their recommendations for their section was mentioned in the book. I bought it because it purported to have information for sections of the country. The information given was basic and I would suggest getting a paperback book and saving your money.The pictures were good -- the best part of the book by far. A small selection of each different type of rose (tea, hybrid tea, floribunda, rugosa, polyantha, etc) was given."
3,Let Down!,"I enjoyed the concept of the cd, using DJs from Nuevo Leon to announce the songs but it hides a fact, the songs are so much weaker than their first release ""Libres Y Locos"". I don't regret buying this CD, I especially enjoyed La Chicana, but if you want to get blown away by this band get their their first CD."
5,Ozomatli has met their match!!,"I checked out this CD after being blown away by Celso Pina's ""Barrio Bravo"" on which they appeared. Fortunately I discovered another gem out of Mexico. Being a product of my father's conjunto music as well as American rock, alternative, and hip-hop, I related to this CD immediately. Horns and electronic sounds fall nicely between catchy vocal hooks and a smooth rock/hip-hop style of rap. Even more refreshing is the accordian at the forefront of a ground breaking, cutting edge music. All of this sits nicely with Latin rythms (primarily cumbia) and a few rock beats as well. With unique song arrangements, a variety of scales, and great vocals, these boys are on to something big for the generation of latinos that fall between worlds of traditional and new. Weird, interesting, and dynamic, a must buy for those who appreciate artistic innovation along with good energetic fun."
2,not worth the money,You can find most of these art activities in the curriculum of students' science/social studies books. Nothing original. Use [...] or look up the incredible art department.
4,Getz goes cosmic,"Some of the material is wonderful, flowing Getz doing what he did best, some isn't the Getz I'm used to. Great sounds but definitely ""counter culture"" influenced. Nice to hear the experimentation with electronics. ""Pretty City"", ""Keep Dreaming"" and ""Another World"" get a little spacey. Other tunes like ""Sum Sum"" and ""Willow Weep For Me"" are jazzy, cool Getz. Fine stuff altogether. Note, actually procured and listened to the original LP recording of this release."
5,Great overall printer,"After much research into an ink-jet printer that would do a decent job for printing my digital photos, I decided to get the Epson 785EX. I was trying to decide between the HP 1315photo printer, this Canon, and the Epson when a customer walked in and told me he loved the Epson.Brought the Epson home, and it took an hour to install. Made some prints, and the photo quality was not anything near to the Lexmark z51 printer that just died on me--both in terms of color quality and clarity.Returned the Epson for the Canon the next day, and love the Canon. I've only had it for a week, but the prints are pretty good quality on plain paper (still not as good as the Lexmark); I like the separate ink tanks (the Lexmark ink cartridges were very expensive!), and it is very fast.No problems on text printing in draft mode, and the software installed in 10 minutes, no problems. I like its simplicity and it should serve the average digital photo hobbyist well."
5,best bang for the buck and then some...,"i've had this printer for little over 5 months now, and i have to say that you get the best bang for your buck and then some. i looked over printers made by hp, lexmark, etc, even looking at some photo only printers and can't really tell the difference. i printed an 8x10 picture with heavy black ink usage and the print turned out way better than i had expected. further, it's so quiet, i sometimes have to hold my head near the printer to make sure it's running. hands down - a great printer. ..."
5,unmatched quality-speed-value,"The Canon S-630 is such a quality printer, I don't know why anyone would shop else where! It has good speed while printing text or photos. But the best part is the ink cost. I only replace the color I used and at ($) per color or ($) for all 3 colors and the black, why pay ($) for HP's 3-colors, with less than half the amount of ink in its cartridge than canons. You can waste your money if you want, I'm sticking with the S-630."
4,I am very happy =),"This printer is very impressive!! The quality of the photo prints are so nice and crisp. We had it up and running within an hour( only because we read the instructions). This was a gift for printing my photos and it does the job. The only problem I can find is paper! The photo paper supplied is the best and I would like more, without paying almost as much for s/h as for product. This is the only reason for the 4 stars, if you live in/near a large city I'm sure this would not be a problem."
4,LOVELY HANDZ,THIS PRODUCT WORKS GREAT FOR THA HANDS AND THE STEP BY STEP DIRECTIONS ARE VERY HELPFUL. THE ONLY DISAPOINTMENT IS THAT AFTER A COUPLE OF USES THE 4 WAY BUFFER STARTS TO PEEL OFF. BUT IT COMES WWITH FREE SAMPLES OF OTHER PRODUCT WHICH IS AN UPSIDE.
4,Happy so far,"havent used these much so far, but am quite happy with them. You can focus really close for considering. They are crisp, not too shaky, as long as you arent. I have not used them in any sort of weather yet, but will be soon. they came in Olive Drab, which made me excited, considering i am going to use them in military things. I have high hopes for these. And out of the box i was happy right away."
5,wonderful addition to have,"I recieved my deck a week ago and they are just beautiful. The subjects choosen for each card and colors in them speak so freely. The book is very informative in the traditions of the meanings for each card, yet reminds you to use the feeling from the card itself. I feel this is a very welcome addition to the world of the tarot readers."
2,Not What I Expected,"This is just a map measuring 27"" x 35"". It is not 27 pages.The panoramic view is different than a regular map. It is interesting but way overpriced. About $... would be a good price for this."
5,Relive the past,"D. J. Stephens tells a story filled with action. He starts his tale in our present time but takes you back to the 1780,s where Jeff Barkil awakes after an attack by a grizzly bear. Has he become someone that once lived in the past? Adopted into the Blackfoot tribe, Jeff becomes known as Bearkiller. He learns their way of life and experiences many adventures. The story takes you to a time when life was harsh and to survive was a daily struggle. You experience, along with Bearkiller, the battles he fights and the patience he must have to outwit his enemies. This book was entertaining and brings to life what it must have been like to be a Native American warrior over two hundred years ago."
5,Excellent Product,"I am grateful because the product is fully compliant with efertado in paguina and his delivery and release tatalmente were correct and agreed on the parameters, the price was fair, very good operation with this supplier, I recommend the widely"
4,Well Built!!!,Been doing a lot of mortgage calculations on this item and I must say have moved a lot of properties because of it! Turbo charged for sure!
4,Overall satisfied,The Platinum is way faster at calculating IRR. I remember the 12c I used before would let me wait for longer than one minute. But the keys on this anniversary edition don't respond as smart as 12c.
5,This is the best,"This is the best calculator for financial users. I am an accounting major and had originally bought a TI, but doing cash flows, etc. with it was so cumbersome. Most of my friends had the 12C and liked it so I gave in and bought it. I am impressed at the ease of use. The Reverse Polish Notation takes a bit to get used to (you can turn it off), but once I figured that out it was a breeze to use.I definitely recommend to any accounting or finance major."
3,the buttons are not very solid,"It's the second time that I buy HP 12C Platinum. I use this calculator for my CFA exam. I bought the first one 1.5 year ago but now some more used buttons are not sensitive at all (like +-=*). I have to press them very hard,, so I bought another one. Unfortunately, as I'm accustomed to use this calculator I cannot change it,,In conclusion, if it had more durable buttons, it was great!"
3,Retro calc - build qulaity is so so,"HP calculators used to be THE calculator to use for finance or science. They were built like tanks and had all the functionality you could ever need. Granted, some people have issues with the RPN entry, but once you get used to it, it actually makes more logical sense - really it does - just give it time. The landscape style of this calc also is great to use and it is fast. However, this is not the HP 12 series of yore. It is cheaply made and almost seems hollow. the buttons are not as firm or tactile as they used to be. The 'leather' style case is nice, but you are going to want and make sure that you baby this device a bit, as I don't think it can hold up like the old ones did. Go into any CFOs office and you'll probably see some version of this veteran calculator. I just wish the old HP quality was there for the price that they request."
3,Quality not what it used to be,"Certainly a decent calculator and speedier than the regular 12C. However the operation of keys are a disappointment. These new 12C calcs do not have the solid feel and smooth key operation the original 12C calcs had. My suggestion, buy a like-new used old 12C from eBay instead of a new one. hp chepened this one up and still charges a premium.In general a tip for the novice. The Texas Instruments BA2 Plus Professional is much easier to use and has a better interface, especially for amortization schedules. The 12C is better for very complex finacial calcualtions but it will take lots of training to use it for these. If you just want to do simple TVM calculations, I would recommend the TI BA2 Plus Professional anytime."
4,Some kinda cheap look,"I needed a financial calculator and I had received a lot of good feedback from 12c owners. This added to my experience with two HP calculators one 15c and one 48G, told me I couldn't go wrong with this special edition.Unfortunately, at least for my taste, It has a kinda cheap look. The flat buttons have started to polish after few days of use. The red text for financial functions, doesn't offer good contrast. HP should keep the display flash after data input, this is one easy way to know data has been entered (something mentioned in one previous review).The overall aspect doesn't measure up to the quality standard when compared with my old 15c from 1983. Some how, the made in china thing is evident.The only reason I got it over the 12c gold is its speed and the limited edition.If you don't mind about speed go for the 12c. It's closer to the original voyager series looking and quality."
4,Better financial calculator,"Much faster than the old Hp 12c and worth the extra money, but make sure you know how to clear the functions if using it for CFA or CFP Exams"
3,"Good, but...","[This comment refers to the 25th anniversary edition]There are, at the time of this writing, 101 reviews of this calculator so I won't go through another detailed one. And I do recommend this HP with one caveat. This calculator is solidly built except for the LCD screen. The LCD, which is not the best I seen, is covered with a soft, flexible plastic which if pressure is applied could damage the the LCD. Also be warned that this plastic film is very easily scratched and marred, even while in the vinyl case. I recommend the use of a film protector similar to those used on PDAs and perhaps a better, sturdier case. HP got really cheap here."
4,Much faster than previous models,Very good calculator. The leather case must be improved - it is not easy to put the calculator back.
2,HP 12C Quality Issue,"I replaced my old 12C gold when the #9 key got hard to push. Now, after about a year with the 12C Platinum Anniversary, the same thing happens. I have to constantly verify on the readout that I did push the #9 hard enough (or that it didn't register twice). I'm on the lookout for a replacement."
2,Poor quality keys,The keys are not nearly as durable as my ancient original 12c. The CLx key no longer works consistently.
4,Overall good,"It can make beautiful picture. But its manual mode is fake. Actually I cannot adjust shutter and aperture in this mode. Although I can adjust shutter or aperture in A/S mode, it is impossible to set value for both simultaneously."
2,Time to retire a once good idea...,"I've given this only two stars not because it is a bad calculator, but that it is no longer needed. As a financial analyst, I coveted mine back in the day and used it constantly with it's reverse Polish notation. Times have changed and things have gotten much better. I now use spreadsheets for calculations and many are freely available for those who can't create them. Calculators are now used on the fly for the simplest of the four math functions (add, subtract, multiply and divide). The new ones are thin, light, show large numbers and cheap. I have one that keeps a running electronic tape so I can check my input. Who today would want to drive a model T when others are whizzing by in their newer models?"
3,HP 12C Platinum Anniversary Edition,"I do not appreciate with delivery time at all. Do you believe it was late more than 10 days that they informed. In addition, I had more cost to post these calculators because I had to move my destination. How bad it was! If I do not need these stuffs, I am sure I would cancel this order."
1,HP 12C Platinum. Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is my 4rd HP 12C and 2nd HP 12C Platinum. The unic problem that I had in my last on was the keys looked.I would suggest that everyone take themselves up one even if you already own a HP12C or regular Platinum.
4,Hard to Figure Out,Definitely wouldn't be my first choice for just a calculator. but I really like it for finance. Read the user manual to find out how to do simple functions. I like the look of the calculator. Better in silver than gold. good buy.
2,HP 12C Platinum Anniversary is a disappointment,"The build of the Platinum Anniversary 12C itself felt good. However,try this operation (i.e. multiplying -10 by 2) by punching keys in thefollowing 3 sequences (in the RPN mode):1) 10 ENTER CHS 2 [X] gives 20.00 and not -20.00.2) 10 CHS ENTER 2 [X] gives the correct answer of -20.00.3) 10 ENTER CHS ENTER 2 [X] gives the correct answer of -20.00.I verified with John Tirone (the author of the book ""Professional RealEstate Problem Solving Using the HP12C"") that if the same keysequences are punched on the black/gold 12C, it consistently gives thecorrect answer of -20.00.Needless to say, I returned the Platinum Anniversary 12C for thisreason and purchased the black/gold 12C instead."
2,Good calculator if you ignore the user's guide,"The user guide for this calculator is obviously either written for another model, or by a tech writer who has serious problems. In many instances when Keystroke Examples are provided, if you key in the information as indicated the calculator will simply give up and provide an error message.The machine works fine if you just address it intuitively after you have trashed the guide book."
3,Not worth extra cost,"I also have a few TI calculators that were much cheaper that do everything this one does. Unless you really like the rpn, it is just another financial calculator."
2,"I thought I loved it, but...","For the CFA exam, this is kind of a joke since it will return incorrect results for some of the basic calcs that involve fractional periods. You end up getting the TI BA anyway, so you might as well buy that now for $20 less. Also, there is no support for parentheses, so chained calcs are annoying to do."
1,Not really a platinum HP-12C,"I ordered a Platinum HP-12C. The item that arrived was essentially a regular HP-12C with Platinum printed on it, but it wasn't a Platinum in any other sense. A real disappointment. If I had time I would return it and get the real thing."
4,Amazon came through,I use the HP12C for real estate appraisal and tax assessing work. It has proven to be a solid tool. My first calculator arrived with a 7 key that did not work. The real surprise was that Amazon.Com took the original back and shipped me a new calculator before the orginal was returned. It was the type of experience that will make me a repeat customer.
5,A must for Finance & Real Estate,"As a recent university graduate, I have enrolled in the CFA program. The CFA Institute only allow the HP 12C and the Texas Instruments BAII Plus for the purposes of the level 1 examination. I had heard/read mixed reviews about both calculators, but eventually decided to go with the HP12C Platinum. This was because I had previously worked with a HP 10BII at university real estate finance and investment courses and wanted a familiar key pad and layout.Although it has taken some adjusting, the 12C Platinum promises to be everything that my previous calculator was and more. Of note is the instruction manual/users guide which can be easily found online and downloaded. It offers numerous worked examples to get you up to speed. I would recommend this calculator to all real estate and finance students and future professionals."
2,Quality issue with the 12C,"I have an HP 48GX that has been kicking for more than twenty years and an HP 11 that is more than 25 years old and still flawless. I have had this 12C for about 18 months and the number 5 key is already giving me trouble (have to press hard for it to register). No drops, no abuse. The overall feel of this new HP is cheaper plastic. The keys feel hollow and light. The available functions are great. This is a classic calculator. But the functions are no good if the keys stop working..."
2,Some keystrokes don't register after a year,"I bought this for the June 2009 CFA level 1 exam. I had an engineering HP calc during school and decided to go with an HP for the CFA exam. A year up to the exam, it was working fine until just about 2 weeks prior to the exam date. Some keystrokes had trouble registering, requiring multiple key taps. Not good! I had to be extra careful with my entries during the exam which slowed me down a bit but I ended up passing. However, I will switch to the TI for level 2 and keep this one as a backup. Contrary to my past experience with HP calcs, the durability of this model is disappointing, especially for the price. It's definitely a mechanical problem, as I ran the on-board self-diagnostics and it passed. Caveat Emptor!"
3,HP 12C Platinum Anniversary Edition,Good: Faster than original HP 12C.Bad: No display flash to confirm an entry like my original USA-made HP 12C.Bad: Keys still feel cheap compared to my original USA-made HP 12C.
1,Verrrry Slooowwww...,"This audio tape left me feeling like I just read a lengthy book jacket. Actually it was like listening to a seminar that was good, but 30 minutes too long. There was just enough meat in it to kindle my interest and show that the author/speaker does have some interesting insights but it dragged on and on so that by the end I felt I'd wasted 90 minutes that would have been better spent listening to an audiotape of a real book, not just a ""presentation"" on a topic.If you are looking for a ""Cliff's Notes"" on Anger with just 3 interesting facts (how anger is affected by being a woman, by ethnicity and by birth order) and a last minute run-though of 12 steps to dealing with anger, buy this. (And I mean ""last-minute,"" at the very end of the tape she reviews a quick list of tips -- you'd find more depth in a women's magazine.)Also I found the author as speaker very tedious. Too much use of those dramatic psychological pauses, stringing about 3 words together at a time."
4,SICK GUN!!!,"Everything about thsi gun totally kicks ass. It has awesome power, and its nicely semi-auto. (as fast as you can click the trigger, it will shoot) It also doesnt use veery much c02, about 45 shots to a canister. The only problem with this gun is its a little bit difficult to reload. Its also really big for a spring pistol and has a very realistic feel. Its perfect for both cbq games and others. It has excellent hop up, and unlike other hop ups, this one doesnt go flying into the air. ITs perfectly accurate everytime is you use .2 grams bbs. Overall this is an awesome gun BUt..i bought thsi gun at big 5 on sale for 40 bucks instead of 70. It was in a Team SD box. Its definetly a better deal at big 5, its never more than 60 bucks. Get this gun, it also doesnt wear outlike a lot of sspring guns might and is very well made."
4,A great gun,"It is really really accurate, and mine got 6 or 7 reloads per canister of Co2, it also is pretty heavy. For a Firepower gun it's great, but if you're looking to spend this much money on a gun, you can sometimes find the HFC M190 for the same price."
1,TYPOS - LOT AND LOTS OF TYPOS,"I was really looking forward to this, as I love the movie, and the chance to read the original novilization was a rare treat...but after only twenty pages I found at least 3 or 4 typos PER PAGE. Don't buy this. I don't care how big of a Hammer fan you are, DO NOT BUY THIS. Trust me. Complete rip off, and was never ever editted. TYpos on almost every single page...at least within first two chapters, when I finally had to put it down. So depressing. This publisher should be put out of business ASAP.Pity, I really really wanted to read this. Do. Not. Buy."
5,A flamin' Hi NRG groove,"I first heard this song off somebody else's copy of the Queer as Folk soundtrack, but it was the edited version. I am therefore happy that I got the remix CD single, which has the extended versoin in all its 10-minute glory. It's written and produced by Barry Harris, who is one half of the incredible remixing duo Thunderpuss (formerly Thunderpuss 2000). This groove is pretty darn hard to resist. If this doesn't have you on the dancefloor within minutes, chances are you're comatose. ""Let's-get-soakin'-wet!"""
1,Non-Scientists Speak,"A book on science/evolution etc. by two people whose only knowledge of lab-work wasprobably the chemistry -set they once got for Xmas!The best they can do is ""parrot"" the ID folks."
2,a disappointment,"As a Christian, I found Colson's and Pearcey's magnum opun well worth reading, but this book (chapter in larger book) simply sides with the Intelligent Design side in the debate. I am sure the authors believe this is the Christian perspective, but I had hoped for insight into reconciling science and faith."
1,Slow and Buggy,"I tried this software and found that it's extremely slow and buggy. Several contacts were lost when I tried to back up the data. It's really just an outlook shell and offers no true CRM features. If you want CRM, get the new version of ACT, Goldmine, or Maximizer."
3,Brasil eiro by Sarava!,I would have wanted to know before I purchased this music that my Amazon MP3 downloader would no longer download MP3s and albums and thAT THE NEW dOWNLOADER COULD NOT BE SAVED ON MY SYSTEM. I do not know if I ill efer get to hear this album even though I have paid for it.. As a customer who looked forward to getting new Amazon MP3s on a daily basis and which is now lost to me I am very dissapointed. I suppose the money I save each month will help ease my dissapointment to some extent because I do not like itunes applications and wont keep one on my computer. Well I have many gigibits of music which I purchased from Amazon and some of it is even backed up. If I ever get to listen to this Album I may write a review because I love much of the good Brasilien music.
5,Excellent Reference Source,"At Last a book that makes sense of the wide disparity of gem prices. Each type of gem is broken down into as many as 20 price ranges. By size, by color, by clarity. Want to know WHY there can be thousands of dollars difference in stones of the same type & size? Buy this book! This book is a reference book. Lot's of information & data, but few pictures. I found it more useful when used with ""Gemstone Buying Guide"", by Rene' Newmann. As a neophite, seeing the pictures in the Newmann book & referencing the valuation tables in this book really helped me evaluate what I was buying. If you buy from TV shows or over the internet, the more information you have, the better your chances are of not overpaying."
1,Needs to be updateed every year........,This type of book needs to be updated every year....especially with the economy we are living in.
5,won't fit,this blade is for the early modle CRAIN Jam saws and will not fit the late model. Other wise it was an allright purchase. No problems Fast shipping and a fair price.
5,Allercetin Allergy tablets are amazing!,"Say goodbye to allergy symptoms such as sneezing, itchy, weepy eyes, runny or stuffy nose, and scratchy throat. These homeopathic tablets are pleasant tasting, dissolve quickly in your mouth, are fast-acting, are all-natural, have no side effects, and can be taken as frequently as needed to end allergy symptoms. From my experience, I only have to take three or four per day, even on my worst allergy days. There appears to be no decrease in effectiveness with regular, year-round use. I highly recommend them."
1,INEFFECTIVE,"I purchased this for a 10 year old with hay fever allergies.We tried the package recommendation of half of the adult dosage with no success. Not even the adult dosage helped the super itchy watery eyes and runny nose. After talking to a pharmacist, I ended up getting Zirtec and it worked!I am a big fan of natural remedies (herbal, homeopathic, etc.), but this one was a huge disappointment."
2,this is just a demo cd,"this is a demo cd for The Spawning, dont wast your time on this cd cause it was recorded with lesser talented former band members and shopped as a demo. pick up The Spawning in place of this cd"
1,The smallest thing Ive ever seen!,"I know it was my fault for not reading the dimentions off the bat. But the picture they show is of the cartoon image and not of the actual unit. It is actually too small your name has to be 5 or less letters to be legible and the faces of the princesses are so small they are distorted. Belle looks like a man! And dont get me started on the stapled packaging this looks so completely used, repackaged and sold its ridiculous!"
4,Love it!,"We checked this out from the library and loved it so much, we bought it! It really is read-outloudable. And the illustrations are great."
3,Western Show Halter Review,"I really enjoy my western bridle. But there are a few problems with it that make it not so great. It is all bent out of shape when it comes out of the box. It needs really gentle care, it falls apart easily.Over all, I think you'd want to use it with gentle handling. Mine is pretty new and I have trouble with it. I have already replaced one of the buckles."
2,low quality,"I bought this because it was the only plain leather bridle set I found on Amazon, with leather reins. but its very thin, soft leather which could easily break. and the metal buckles are just thin cut metal, maybe tin since they were already tarnished and partly black when it arrived."
5,Hassl,"I first met David during a spell in the hospital. He came to my bedside and brought a copy of his CD - WATCH OUT FOR DAVID HASSLEHOFF. How my little heart became shiny and light while listening to 'Looking for Freedom', especially the Ibisa Chill-out version. Although I now had no legs - and even David's patented organic legs had failed to work for me as they had for Mattew Power - I swung my prosthesis in syncopated rhythm to 'Do the Limbo Dance'. As my Mum is fond of saying, David is just like Princess Diana. Visiting people in hospital, special fashion sense, and long eyelashes. If only the Queen of our Hearts could have met the King of my heart, they would have made a much better couple than that Mr Dodi. Sometimes when I lie in bed in the darkness, and listen to this album, I think that David is talking directly to me, especially 'Let's Spend the Night Together'. I know that one day he and I will meet again, and I can shower him with my gratitude for this wonderful, wonderful gift."
4,More than I expected...,"I intend to use pictures from this book as 'models' for paintings. I expected the subjects of the photos to be much more 'cutesy', but what a nice surprise that they are realistic. And lots of very informative historic background info including dates and different regions of France."
4,becoming aware of every bodily move,"When I met Jean Couch at a workshop and felt the importance of her message I bought the DVD on Balance to remind this body of her message. Only when the sciatic nerve began reminding me of the pain with every twist, step, bend, and painful sitting did I return to her and began following the lessons on sitting, walking, bending, lying down, all like a youngster learning for the first time. Now weeks later I am pain free, but only when I follow the balance rules reminded by the good photos of perfect balance on her video. Pain is the teacher she reminds us. Balance is the cure."
2,loose parts,Lens has a small plastic ring that covers the screws in the back of the lens. This ring is not retained in any way. In my case this ring came out of the lens and jammed my cameras mirror in the up position. The advice given by Tamron was to send the lens to them and they will decide if the warranty applies. I can not have a lens that has parts that can fall into my camera. Will not buy another Tamron product.
4,PRICE OF PEACE,ANOTHER GREAT BLACK FOX STORY WE HAVE ENJOYED ALL THREE OF THESE DVD WILL BE LOOKING FOR MORE SERIES LIKE BLACK FOX TO PURCHASE
3,Not good for beginner,"I bought this determined to learn the mouth harp. It really isnt too bad of a harp but if you are a beginner i would recommend going with an alto harp. They are much easier to get a sound. And if you are a beginner, check out YouTube for some tutorials on how to play."
4,Works pretty good....,I used this for a stocking stuffer at Christmas along with some kazoos. We played songs but the jaw harp gets a little overwhelmed by the loud kazoos. Works OK and best played alone. Nice for driving people crazy and making weird sound effects.
2,Cheap Jaw Harp,"This jaw harp did not play well at all. I am new at this, but the Grover Alto Jaw Harp is much much better."
3,Tongue Not Centered,"Jaw harp had a misaligned tongue and the metal paint/plating would occasionally chip off too. It took me 3 days to finally get the thing to work, although it would rattle a little because of the misaligned tongue. My advice is to give yourself a couple days before giving up on the thing."
4,More than a toy - it works really well,"I don't know why others dislike this jaw harp, its easy to play & a lot of fun. It took a little time to get it adjusted out of the box, but after some bendind & tweaking, it works great. It came with VERY simple instructions, & I was playing rather well in just a few minutes. It requires no musical skills whatsoever, & everyone who's seen it in action loves it instantly, & as I said, it's just a lot of fun. Mine is a couple of yrs old now, & it still works perfectly w/ almost no signs of wear. I think it will last a long long time. At this price, I don't see how anyone can lose. I Truely hope this review is helpful."
5,"Great, For the Price","I had to put mine in a vise to close the gaps, and I had to bend the center piece sideways to center it. After that though it produces consistent and loud sounds. I ended up purchasing four more of these for other people. For the price, there really is no room to complain."
4,Fun Little Gadget,"Great little harp for kids. It actually works. It came as described, packaged well. This is a good gift for kids for play and as a learning tool for more advanced instruments. It's also a great gag gift for family, friends, office ""white elephant"" events, etc. It can also be used by middle aged guys who want to show up to a social function and amuse but mostly annoy people."
1,Junk,"These aren't worth the money at any price. After a lot of frustration trying to play this thing I actually met a guy that plays regularly. After telling him how much trouble I was having he brought his collection in to work one day and gave a little performance. He spends ~$25 a piece on a harp, I tried one and what a difference. He tried to play this one and could barely get a sound out of it. Spend the extra $20, it's worth it."
2,Snoopy poopy,Recently bought a snoopy jaw harp. It was misaligned and not wellmade. The Trophy brand are much better.
1,do not waste your money,"These are incredibly lame, even professionals cannot even get a sound out of them. Do not waste your money on these.Yes they are cheap, look like any other mouth harp, but you won't get a sound of them.spend $10 more and get something fantastic."
2,Nope...don't do it.,"I got this harp first and got pretty good at it...but then i bought the Trophy Alto Jaw Harp. MAJOR IMPROVEMENT. The snoopy harp is very rigid and you have to press it against your teeth very hard for it to work. If you mess up or slip it will whip your teeth so hard.I thought this was normal because the snoopy was my first harp. Anyway, I bought the Trophy Alto next...SO much better. I can relax more and not have to worry about keeping it smashed up against my teeth. It doesn't even hurt if it whips my teeth because it is a lighter piece of metal.The alto for me is a much better sound too. Much more twangy and energetic sounding. The snoopy harp is pretty low and bassy.sidenote: I bought 2 snoopy harps so i know it wasn't just a defective one."
2,you get what you pay for,"The company was awesome efficient and very quick to do business with and I would very quickly do business with them again. I would also recommend them to anyone. but the Juice harp I bought is just so cheap it sounds awful...I thought a harp is a harp, but obviously that's not the case..when I go to buy a real one I will return to the same company and buy a better one...."
3,It just sounds poorly,"I bought it just to have fun with my son and I have memories of playing with one of these when I was a kid. At home it is called Marranzano, o scacciapensieri, and there is a great tradition of this instrument, just check with a search engine or on youtube.This one is the jaw harp equivalent of a $50 violin or those guitar starter pack or a $100 trumpet. With some efforts you can pull something out of them and probably an experienced player can even make them sound decent but it really should resonate more on its own to begin with."
3,Definitely a toy,This harp makes noise but it is a toy not an instrument. Something to play around with but spend the extra and buy a quality harp if you are looking for better sound and reliability.
2,Not heavy duty,The design is nice but its not very rugged. The spot welds have all broken and the barrier extension is now lashed together with string. The string seems to be working.
5,Great router. Cheap and has been super reliable.,"Wanted to replace my old linksys router and found this. The interface is nice but the best part has been the reiliability. I configured the thing, and i haven't had to touch it since. My old linksys needed to be rebooted every so often to restore connectivity. Highly recommended for a basic home router."
5,Does what it says,"I have used trendnet products (POE switch and WAPs) before but was not sure how easy this would be to set up. I have a vonage router that would come after this and didn't know if I would have to change numerous settings. I tested it out and was surprisingly disappointed at how easy it was to install it and get everything to work. It literally was plug and play. When I have used linksys stuff in the past it has been a pain sometimes, but I am glad I bought this."
5,"Simple, Effective, Fast... GREAT VALUE!","I just finished setting up this router. It only took me 5 minutes! I followed the short instructions exactly and the only ""issue"" I ran into is that I had to reset my modem for the internet to work initially. I purchased this wired router because my husband and I didn't want a wireless network in our home but we wanted to use both the computer internet and our xbox live internet at the same time. This router does the trick! I am so happy to say that tonight we just streamed a video via hulu on the xbox live while simultaneously streaming a youtube video on the computer. FYI: we have a 60mbps cable internet from charter cable and the videos both buffered in less than 2 seconds and never skipped."
1,Support is terrible,"Router freezes every time an attempt is made to upload a file to the web. Tech support is terrible. After waiting 10 minutes on hold I was able to speak with a tech who barely spoke English. Without trying to diagnose the problem he suggested that it would just be easier for me to return the router. Problem is, it's 6 months old and the store will not take it back. Thankfully the cost was only $35. The last TRENDnet router I'll ever buy."
3,Trendnet Router,"Very simple and easy, but it isn't stable for gaming networks. It hold its connection but lag when attempting to play you tube video while gaming and or music. which i was able to do with my previous router. It works for hooking up my three computer very well, so it is strong and reliable enough to handle computing signals."
2,Not Reliable,"First off, the cable that came with the product was crimp so much that it would not work, so I had to purchase a different cable. Once the router was up and running the service was very shoddy. I work from home and run off a network server which requires me to have a constant connection. During a 10 hour period I would lose my connection around a dozen times. After about a week of use the router just completely fried itself and was no longer operable. Sent back for a refund. Now using a Linksys combo router that I purchases for about $10 more that works perfectly."
1,Bad Choice,One star is being generous. I bought this router to replace my worn out (5 year old) Linksys router. Seemed like a good deal (cheap). The TRENDnet router was deemed defective after spending two hours on the phone with an (outsourced) TRENDnet tech who seemed to have less of an idea than I did on how to get it going. DON'T BUY ONE. I went to the local electronics store and bought another Linksys. It set-up perfectly the first try minutes after I got it home.
1,Didn't work for me - no WAN IP no matter what i did....,Comcast + Zoom 5341 + This device = no go.... it wouldnt get WAN IP... even after 30 min with comcast modem off and comcast support resetting my modem over and over it didn't get WAN ip.... cloning MAC etc didnt work either... old router no issues .... gets ip everytime... well i tried....
2,only adequate for $20.00,using this as a switch.trying to change the default IP address took a couple of attempts. it seemed to have problems saving it.the reset button is wonky.don't buy it.
5,Excellent product!!!,"Don't let the ""generic"" name fool you, this is a great little router... and I do mean little, it's very small, smaller than the network switch I replaced... I didn't have quite the ease of installation as some folks, but my problem was due to the Motorola Surfboard gateway modem I have, it was complicating matters... I had to make a quick phone call to the cable company and they had me straightened out quickly... once it was up, smooth sailing... all four of my computers and our printer are online... all four computers getting 10mb speeds consistently... as a quality test I played a Netflix movie on each of my four computers simultaneously with NO lag... works for me... can't go wrong for the price!!!"
1,no good do not purchase,tried to install several times no luck just throwed this piece of garbage in can
1,The vendor sent the wrong product,"The vendor sent a Trendnet Router, but it wasn't the one in the picture. It was a small black square one. I want whats in the picture. I won't be returning it because I need it and it does work, but I don't like being given something different than what I paid for."
5,works great for comcast easy to set up,It was plug and play for meSome Ethernet connectors will stay in to back of this better than others.Once it was up and in permanent place I used toothpick to lock in the Ethernet connecters from popping out of the back. It's been fine for 6 months.
3,Expectations not met.,"Couldn't get the router configured to access the network; I returned it. Will go wireless, and hope for better success. I believe it may work for others."
2,Router not letting all pages come up,Router not letting all pages come up.Call TrendNet to help with problem and they don't know what is going on.All web pages work until hook router on and some web pages not coming up and some only half page coming up
2,Not as good as we hoped,"There aren't too many options for a wired router that is also inexpensive and allows port forwarding so we purchased this one. It worked well for the 2 computers we hooked it up to...and we had fast speeds with it once we set up port forwarding. BUT it wasn't functioning with our third computer. That computer was receiving no internet (connection error) and could not access the router configuration in the browser. I tried many things to fix it (disable firewall & antivirus, switch cables, etc) but just couldn't get that computer to access our network despite the computer being recognized by the router. This is after I already called our ISP to reboot the modem. We purchased a different router last week and hooked it right up, NO problems. All 3 computers worked great, it had 8 ports, and was less than $30. So...sadly this router was a failure for us. If only all connections worked fine I would have given it 4.5 stars (though more than 4 ports would be better)."
2,Partially failed within 48hrs,I was looking to update my aging Linksys router and I thought I would give this a try. The TRENDnet router installed rather quickly and worked fine for about 48hrs then 1 of the 4 channels stop working. The router is made for 4 PCs running at the same time and that is what I have hooked up to it. I tried rebooting a dozen different times and finally gave up and went back to my old (slower) but reliable Linksys. I'll just eat the $25 I paid for it or give it to someone that just runs 3 PCs or less.
1,Don't buy this router,"I could not get this router working, so called customer service and spent 4 hours on the phone with someone inIndia who was difficult to understand and he could not get it to work. Spare yourself the trouble. Will return today."
1,Customer service/Tech Service is a joke,I called Tech Service and after holding for five or ten minutes I got a rep. and was told they would need tocall me back. I never got a call back.I returned the router.
4,Works terrific...easy set up...,Bought this to be able to watch Netflix on my internet ready HDTV. Hookup was a piece of cake...getting a high quality picture through this router. I don't notice any slow down on my PC either. Worth $25.00 for sure.
1,It just doesn't seem to work,"Every router that I've ever owned until this one has been easy to set up but I just can't get this one to work.Usually, you connect the modem to the router and the router to a PC, turn everything on in order and it works. This one doesn't. The quick start guide says to go through the setup page to make it work, so I did that.Strangely, it asks for the mac address of the modem, something I've never had to enter before and also for the DNS servers of my ISP, but it says that those are optional. I've tried leaving those entries blank and filling them in, nothing works.Perhaps if you're an experienced network professional, you can make this work but I'm sending mine back, hopefully, the next one that I get works out of the box, like every other router that I've owned."
2,Worked great...for 6 months,"Easy set up. Inexpensive and worked right out of the box...for 6 months. Today, unexplainably lost power and does not work. Beware."
1,Doesn't work,Does not work. I tried everything that the DVD instructions suggested and everything that technical support suggested to no avail; also their technical support linguistic capabilities have lot to be desired especially in English. Buyer beware.
2,not much,"I was looking for a router that was not wireless to replace an aging router that acted as a gateway for my overly complicated home network and bought this, one of the few wired only routers I could find. Firmware lacks blocking to specific computers or sub nets which I use to secure my network from computer that have been blocked by my firewall attempting to access my network. I was never able to configure my network to allow access computers that were on other routers connected to this one so I put the old one back in place and put this back in the box. You however may live a simpler life and it might work fine."
4,What do you do?,"This is a wonderful book for young children! I keep this book at my office for youngsters to review while talking with there parents. This book has pages of delightful pictures with weimaraners portraying different careers. The reader/viewer will see a doctor, fireman, waitress and many more types of career oriented wiemaraners. This is a wonderful book for children to review to explore their imaginations and ask about many types of careers. I would recomment this book to any dog lover and/or parent."
4,Rutter's Poulenc CD is great,"This is a spirited performance of beautiful music. It is typicallyan ""English"" choral sound -- lots of head tones, crystal-clear diction,performance clarity.BUT if you want the ""definitive"" Poulenc Gloria, this is not it. Actually,I have the first recording made of the Gloria -- an Angel mono LP ""madewith supervision of the composer"" (whatever that means) in 1961.It's a grand, operatic performance, but it's a little soggy in places,and the soprano tended to drag. Maybe this is the definitive PoulencGloria, I don't know.I certainly like the Rutter performance for its clarity."
1,Don't buy this camera,"I had this camera for 2 years and had constant trouble with the door mechanism for the tape. It opens from the bottom and the tape pops up! Many times it got stuck and finally it would not open. $400.00 to fix it. SONY SERVICE IS TERRIBLE, we are now forced to buy another camera as it's not worth fixing for $400!"
5,INSPIRING!,"A very wide range of native american designs are in this book. Very easy to understand and use. Quilting designs, and easily traced and enlarged templates."
5,The Ex - Turn,"This record is fantastic.The Ex have gone in a new and exciting direction with this double cd. There is alot of African music mixed in the noise; the lyrics are powerful, the noise is organized yet frantic, still with a very punk attitude....like every Ex record.I would recommend this album highly. I just saw them on their European tour a bunch, and the live experience is second to none.The Ex have been around for 25 years now, and get better with every record. Pick it up, listen at maximum volume, it will supprise you."
3,Invention,This is a music invention. The attitude makes this work. What could be almost deliberately unusual and unbelievable manages to suck you in. pretty darn good and fresh
2,"LOVED the first two, not so much this one","Eh....I just recently discovered the Myron Bolitar series and I LOVE the first two in the series, but NOT this one!! I was bored halfway thru and pretty much skimmed through the rest and gave up.I'm going to get the 4th book from the library and I'm hoping it's more interesting like the first two books in the series were."
5,Back Spin,This is one of my favorite Authors. I follow his story lines of Myron Bolitar and fine this is one of Coben's excellent writings.
2,not my style,"I am a fan of Harlan Coben but have never read this particular series. In contrast to the majority of reviews, I found this to be tedious rather than witty and in need of additional editing. Lame, forced dialog on top of a silly plot...even taking it for what it is, there are better ways to spend one's time."
4,The Myron Bolitar Series,"I've read four of the books in this series. The author writes well, and his characters are engaging, but he needs to change it up a bit, or Myron and Win will soon become stale. This is the fate that befalls many a series, whether it's Jack Reacher or James Bond. There's only so much you can do with a protagonist, and still keep him or her fresh.All in all, I'm satisfied with the books, but I feel that they will eventually run their course, and I'll be looking for new blood."
2,FADE AWAY fades away slowly,Half way through the book and still slogging along. I keep reading hoping something will happen.
1,Buyer beware,"This is a great book BUT pay attention. It is a REPRINT of a book first published in 1996. I was so excited to see a NEW RELEASE Myron book I didn't notice. Personally, I think they should have to state such IN LARGE PRINT on the cover."
3,good but not his best,"i know everyone else is raving about this one, but I liked the first 2 better....still, it moves along very fast and is fun to read..."
3,"Witty dialogue, but there's some story problems","Ok. Don't get me wrong. I'm a MB fan and I thoroughly enjoy the freshness of Coben's writing. Fade Away does a very good job of bringing out the details of the series back story, especially with HC's deft use of dialogue. But, I thought there were some serious holes in the story. First, Greg was supposed to have this job driving taxis. It was an unnecessary storypoint--one that was summarily ignored during any of the investigations.I guess I should read the MB series as thrillers rather than mysteries. HC doesn't create a puzzle for you to solve. No clever clues to point you to the killer.As I progress through the series, I'm finding Win to be more and more of a superfiscial prop to the story--nothing more than a utility ""black ops"" mercenary. I think it's rather sad to have a crutch like the Win character to rely on for nearly anything having to do with lock picking, number tracing, or blowing off a bad guy's head."
5,Fade Away,Great read. Exciting all the way to the end.I have recomended this book to allmy friends. This author has a way ofmaking you not wanting to put the book down
5,Rollercoaster of a Read,"I discovered Harlen Coben's Myron Bolitar a few months ago. I started with the first novel in the series, fell in love with Myron and his friends, and have continued to move forward from there. Myron just keeps getting better all the time, and so do his friends... the maniacal Win and best friend/assistant Esperanza.Myron staging a comeback with the Dragons may seem like a stretch, but it fits with the plot. From there the plot takes some breathtaking twists and turns, finally arriving at a crescendo of an ending with a surprise you won't see coming."
4,Great Read!,"All of Coben's Myron Bolitar mystery novel's are easy to read, very witty, but with dark parts that offset the humor. You really end up caring for the main characters, and that ultimately is what makes a great novel."
4,Satin chrome massage pen,"Pen works great. Massage tip is a little small and hard. Instructions are a little cryptic. (picture of hand is shown, but is it the front or back of hand?) Fun novelty."
3,Springtime in a small town,Beautiful photo. A story that was told slowly. Should be enjoyed in a quiet setting much like you enjoy a long drink watching the sun set. I wasn't necessarily happy with the resolution of the situation in the story but that's life. Not always easy. See it attentively and you'll see how it grows on you.
5,You must have this...,"Wonderful, wonderful band from Cincinnati. If you do not own this cd then your music collection is definitely lacking! You will not be disappointed."
1,Shampoo Not What It Used To Be!,"I have been using Artec Kiwi shampoo since the early 1990s. The conditioner has not changed and is still a fabulous product. The shampoo, however, is NOT the same product! Either the formula has been changed, OR it's not the correct shampoo in the bottle. It has a powdery/flowery scent, and the look and texture are completely different. It cleans well; however I have migraines triggered by certain scents and cannot use. Be aware. The shampoo is NOT THE ORIGINAL!"
4,Fun plot,I find the script quite funny. I liked the British one and I liked this one. Sometimes we just need to laugh !
2,WHERE'S THE HUMOR? HELLO!,This one lasted about 15 minutes for me. It was awesome to see so many actors and actresses I recognized from other movies and shows but I didn't find anything really humorous and that's why you watch a comedy. HUMOR: D minus; STORY/PLOTTING: C; CHARACTER/PLOTTING: B minus; OVERALL GRADE: C minus; WHEN WATCHED: January 2011.
5,Death at a funeral,"The movie starts out slow , speeds up, and parts are so halarious, you'll crack a rib laughing. Chris Rock playing the straight roll makes it even funnier."
1,"My, oh my...","Danny Glover: why on Earth would you ever agree to shoot a scene like the ""poop scene""? Unbeliavable how low can an actor reach.James Marsden in a useless role; pieces that are simply not funny. This is one of the worst comedies ever filmed. Absolutely nothing works. All actors should have been embarassed to appear in a turd like this."
1,"Horrible language, horrible movie","I was really excited to watch this movie, but I was drastically disappointed. Not only was the f-bomb used in almost every sentence, the movie was dully drawn out. Chris Rock was far from funny, and the actors seemed as if they didn't really want to be in the movie. I wouldn't watch this movie again if someone paid me. It lowered my IQ."
1,TERRIBLE,THIS WAS THE WORST DVD I HAVE EVER SEEN. THEY SHOULD GIVE THIS GARBAGE TO YOU FOR FREE. THE WORST ACTING I HAVE EVER SEEN. NOT FUNNY AT ALL. I'M SORRY I PAID FOR THIS MESS.
3,It was okay!,"I don't know, this movie made me laugh and all, but I think it was a little gross in the one bathroom scene with Danny Glover, and that part could have been avoided. But other than that I think I liked this one better than the British version."
2,Not as Funny as Hoped -,"""Death at a Funeral"" has a top notch cast, including Chris Rock, Luke Wilson, Danny Glover and Martin Lawrence to name just a few. However, it ends up being a dumb movie with people doing dumb things. The story revolves around a patriarch's funeral, which turns into a chaotic whirl of people doing dumb things. The situations are outrageous, from the wrong person being in the casket to main characters taking LSD and acting like the movie is actually funny.There is a British version of the same movie and it is not much better. So even if you sprinkle the movie with top notch stars, the script still matters. It is not funny, everyone is yelling, angry, or tuned out on drugs."
2,another forgetable remake,"The original black and white version was far better (MORE COHERENT). Remakes usually aren`t as good as the original, and neither is this one. They tried to make it more palatable for today`s U.S. audiences and it closely followed the script, but something was lacking. I think it tried to hard to be funny without much success."
2,Awful,Somebody must have owed chris Rock a favor. I like Chris Rock but with all the stars in this movie I was expecting a whole lot more. Make no mistake that this is NOT a good movie by any stretch of the imagination. I hated every character in this movie. I didn't even like the mother and she just cried the entire movie.
4,Death at A Funeral Review,Death at a Funeral was very hilarious and full of laughter. I can watch it over and over.
4,Death at a Funeral,"I found it funny despite the lack of humor from Chris Rock and Danny Glover,Martin Lawrence and Tracy Morgan were Hilarious,and the Bathroom scene with Tracy was sick and funny.It drags on but it is very funny along with the little guy who from the start makes what the movie will be obvious."
2,Watch the 2007 version.,"An American version of the 2007 British comedy. I'd highly recommend the British version over this one. The movie works much better as a low key English comedy than the over the top, over produced, American sitcom that this version presents."
1,Give it a miss,"A remake of the charming British movie, however lacks all the humor, charm, and finesse of the British version. Also an awful lot of swearing and childish humor (and I'm not a prude). Unfortunately I bought this version by mistake, rather than the British version, which I love. Give this one a miss, and get the original British movie, for a real treat."
3,Dad died but his lover is dead too...,"Don't waste your money on this one, rent this one. I am a kind person that love comedian movies but I had a feeling that I should rent dvd before I purchase ""Death at a funeral"" , so I went rent it. I thought it was going me laugh whole the night keeping up ppl but not crack a smile! I was like ""Oh ok whatever what is next?"" then I found myself walking off in my bedroom to other room in hoping they are done , I seldom paused a screen ingoring the part. I don't usually do that when there both my actors Martin Lawneress and Chris Rock but they acted okay in that movie, esp. For funeral director, He was supposed to be funny along with Danny Glover ...BOO! I would have been falling sleeply if it have not been them crack jokes."
1,what a rip-off,"I watched the original European movie. It is a great dark comedy. I do not know why they would want to make an American version. In my humble opinion, the African-American version was less intellectual perhaps thinking its audience would not understand an intellectual non-verbal joke. Instead everything has to be explained. This is a very less intelligent version of the original. They do have the token white guys to try to main stream it. I guess each audience its different....."
1,DEATH AT THE MOVIE THEATRE,"When I saw the preview, I said to myself, ""This is either going to be really funny or it's going to be really bad."" And to me, it was bad. I think I laughed out loud once. Chris Rock wasn't funny, Martin Lawrence wasn't funny and Tracy Morgan was definitely not funny. The only funny part was the guy who'd taken the ""valium."" I found myself looking forward to seeing him. I could have done without the rest of the cast.I'm sorry folks but this movie just was not knee-slapping funny to me. It could have been but it just wasn't. If I could have given it a ZERO star, I would have. The bathroom scene with Tracy Morgan and Danny Glover was disgusting. Chris Rock and Martin Lawrence were brothers who were nine months apart. Who does that? Was Martin's character a premature baby when he was born? I absolutely love Chris and Martin but this movie just didn't do anything for me. I wanted my money back when I left the theatre."
2,Good cast lets you down,"A family gathers to mourn the death of their patriarch. This sounds rather somber until it is revealed that among the mourners are Chris Rock, Tracey Morgan, and Martin Lawrence. With this cast, you would expect to leave the theater in tears from fits of laughter, not lamenting the outlay of $7.00 and an hour and a half of your time. The film is not a total loss, as there are some clever lines, and moments of levity, but with this cast, more was expected. The scenario of a family being blackmailed by a gay midget has comedic appeal, but it just does not come together here."
1,Death At A Funeral,I Never Got It And Just kept the movie that was sent even though I never saw that one eather
1,horrible horrible horrible remake...,"this has got to be one of the worst remakes ever!!! Hollywood just cant ""Americanize"" British humor... Watch the original, its one of the funniest movies! Totally recommend the original if you like silly British humor... I gave this one star, because i had to..."
2,Didn't Like it,"Was excited about the star-studded cast, but I really didn't enjoy the potty humor in this movie. And there was a lot more of it in this one than in the original, it seems like."
1,Deadly dull comedy,"Usually when Hollywood does a remake, it's done for one of two reasons: either the studio believes the original was such a hit that a slightly-off carbon copy will make money, too, or it's a successful foreign film they pick up on the cheap so they can do a quick translation of it in order to make money, too.The reasons for Sony Pictures doing a remake of Death at a Funeral are a lot less clear, except for the `make money' part.[...]"
5,Found it hard to put down.,"I just finished the first of the series ""The Interfacers"" and orderd a copy for my mother. I have personally had an out-of-body experience and so have others that I know. This book helped me to believe in an after-life and not fear death.You do not have to be religious (I'm Not) to appreciate this story and do not have to even beleive in it. It is a good story on its own.I am now reading ""Miracle at Mercy Hospital"" which is a continuation of the first book and find it just as good and interesting. I hope that the author writes more books on the subject. The books are definately worth finding if not available here."
3,Received It Damaged,"I purchased the black model. The guitar is a great value. I have owned many expensive, and not so expensive guitars, and purchased this Washburn for fun. My only problem, and this is a BIG one: I received the guitar with softball sized ding on the body. It plays fine, but I will never order musical instruments online again. Again, the Washburn is great value."
5,I love Washburn,"I'm very happy with my Washburn. The smell of the mahogany hole is intoxicating. After recieving my black D100, I turned it into my ""Neil Young Special"": I warped the neck, broke my ""B"" string, scratched my pick deeply across the top, drop tuned it, and laid a lit joint on about six places. It may not sound like much but it sure looks cool -- especially when people see me playing ""Heart of Gold"" in my Levi's jacket and ripped jeans.Please, buy this guitar, and anything Washburn."
3,A mixed bag,"The cargo bag is easy enough to use, but the construction and materials is not such that I would use it to travel across country or drive through inclement weather. I believe it is intended for light duty in decent weather and while I haven't had the same experiences as other reviewers, I would suggest securing it with a backup system like bungie cords or a cargo net. I think it's fine for short trips but I wouldn't put anything inside it that I just couldn't live without - but I wouldn't put anything valuable in a roof cargo system that wasn't metal and designed to be securely affixed via metal racks to my vehicle roof, like the far more expensive roof rack cargo systems you can purchase elsewhere on Amazon. Those cost hundreds of dollars - this is a soft-material bag that costs under $50. Buy what you need, spend what you must, and gauge your expectations accordingly."
5,Worked for me,"I used it on a 300 mile road trip and although I did not drive through any ""rough weather"" everything seemed to survive just fine. I also used bungee cords to hold it down as well as the straps that are provided."
3,Requires more patience than an average six-year old,"While the Puppy instructions are clear and concise (which is very helpful in filling the water reservoir) the interactive ""pet points"" are a little hard to find. Worse though is the amount of time required to pet the puppy in order to get it to start licking. Our real dog will start licking the moment you look at it, but the Love n' Licks Spaniel evidently requires a lot more lovin' than that, and takes much more patience (and petting) than the average six-year old has. This is even more difficult if you're trying to pet it and hold it in a position that will result in licks to the face."
1,Major disappointment!!!,"It seems like every Christmas there is one toy that is at the top of the list that is a major bust, and this year it is the Love N Licks Puppy!!! This was the only thing my 5 year old daughter really wanted, and she is so disappointed we can't get it to do anything than bark (or whine as it really sounds)! She is sad feeling like it's her fault, like she's not 'loving it enough'.I thought maybe we had just gotten the one lemon, but it looks like they are all like this. I can't believe a manufacturer would put this out and set up so many kids for disappointment.Major disappointment!! Don't waste your money or set your kids up to be extremely disappointed!"
3,Mostly 2004 Campaign Ad,"It's a light, quick, fluff read. If you liked Gore/Lieberman in 2000 you'll like the book. Lieberman falls all over himself emphasizing his religion while feigning shock that it could be an issue. He also sidesteps any criticism from fellow Jews that his positions are decidedly unorthodox. He emphasizes that everywhere his wife ever went and everyone she ever spoke to always loved her. If something went wrong in the campaign, it was because he didn't follow through with his instincts. He even quoted an editorial where someone said that Lieberman can make an attack not feel like an attack. Hardball politico, but with a smile."
2,Not tough enough,I need something that I can use to cover blisters on my fingers when playing golf. This tape simply doesn't stick. After a few shots it falls off.
5,Very pleased with TIMEX,"This is the second clock TIMEX that I buy, the first one in Christmas for my daughter and now for San Valentine for my wife. Very pleased with these products. Exactly what is described about the product is what I received. The shipment is very quick and sure. thank you"
4,Great watch but hard to size,"I love this watch, but removing links from the band was very difficult and the directions included were awful!!"
4,Inattention,"I love the music, I love the style, I love her voice...but not really thinking, I didn't anticipate an entire album of bar songs...foolish me.I will buy more Lila Downs albums, just pay more attention to the title instead of just listening to the NPR interview and review."
3,Lila Down's la cantina,"I love Lila Down, but not being mexican, this is not my type of music. My mexican friends of certain age (not very young) give it 5 stars."
2,"too clever, I really mean it","While there is no shortage of talent, her style and the overall production is a little too tongue in cheek for me. I wish she had performed these songs with less affectation. More heart and less concept would have made this a more lasting album and a greater achievement. She's a gifted artist, but she needs to trust the music more and not try to trick it out like this. The result sounds like parody even if her intentions towards the music were more honorable than that."
4,this book was interesting and very informative,"I was looking for further reading for my 12 yr old on the time period of the reign of Isabella and Ferdinand in my local library, and this is all I found, so I borrowed it. It was fascinating. I am not Jewish, but it makes the time period more interesting to understand the important role of the Jewish people, and how badly they were treated for hundreds of years due to the lack of separation of church and state in Spain and Portugal at the time. Other countries had more religious tolerance, and it is interesting to see how this shapes the course of history and the exploration for and control over trade routes. It covers a long time span, giving some background from Roman times and then focusing more on medieval times of exploration."
3,Adequate.,Perhaps I have read too many other books about the subject to appreciate this one. I felt it was somewhat simplistic.
2,Elementary,Good for someone that does not use internet. Too elementary for Amazone population. More detail would had been much better.
4,Anne Murray's First Musical Video,"A year after the Anne Murray Center opened, Anne Murray herself made a video to celebrate the success of her life as a singer. With some of her finest work as a singer, and opening the Center, she has made this video a must have for her fans to see and to own. And as one of her fans, this is one of her finest work on television."
1,poor performance,Two of the speeders lasted 3 games each before they became defective. We were still able to play with them but they were so deformed that they did not travel straight. The third speeder fell apart on the very first serve. I will not purchase this product again.
5,good stuff my freinds,"Look i bought this guitar thinking i was just going to get a cheap $99 guitar, the thing sounds awesome, and it plays like a champ. Good action, nice tone, all of the frets are clean there isn't any ring of the strings or anything. I'm telling you for 99 bucks your getting a really good deal. Dont be the guy that passes this up!"
4,bang for the buck,"These D100's are great guitars. There are a lot bigger names out there (of course those glue smelling fender/Yamaha cheaper proves that names mean nothing) but Wash is always a better sound. This guitar is not the perfect guitar. It's not a Taylor nor does it want to be (and it isn't $3,000 like one either). This is just a great beginner play. And... it makes a good bass driven blues guitar to boot."
2,Buy The Original Releases,"For anyone who has never heard the original recording this may be the way to go. If you have the original, as I do, this recording sounds very thin in comparison. It is bad enough that I contacted Rhino. They were nice enough to send replacements but those sounded just as bad. I absolutely love these albums and it is a shame that this recording is so bad. If you want the albums look into buying used versions of the originals."
5,Combination of great artists having fun,"Something like the Traveling Wilburys does not happen very often. Great individual artists getting together to have some fun and, as a result, we have something fun to listen to. Well worth adding to your collection."
4,"Great, but I like Vol 3 better than Vol 1","It just seems like a stronger collection of songs, I especially love The Devil's been busy. It's quite an underrated song. On Vol I I really like Handle with care, Not alone and End of the line but I'm not that impressed by the other songs on it. Well that's what I think, my review."
5,Traveling Wilburys 2CD/1DVD,Excellent. I love the Wilburys and everything Beatle related and I was not disapointed. We all know the CDs but packaged with the DVD is excellent.
5,Oh my,"These cds have some of the best sounds you will hear. The music is not only played well, but this one is mixed to perfection. Every time I hear it, I am impressed. If you are interested in just plain good sound, get this. Oh, did I mention that the music is unbelievable as well? This is truely a masterpiece."
5,Outstanding,I love the sound of The Wilburys. I put it right near the top of my collection. Too bad we lost George and Roy so young. They are all great talents
4,Traveling Wilburys-good and bad,"The DVD was fun and it was nice seeing Roy and George alive again. The first album is definitely the better one. They lose some of the melodic nature on the 2nd/3d album without that VOICE. Both Tom Petty and Bob Dylan have fame as monotones and Roy isn't there to push them along. It got more nasal as it droned on and I turned it off and went to Los Tres Panchos for some Bolero therapy. I've gotta have melody, harmony AND rhythm. But the 1st one is great, and the DVD too."
5,Traveling Wilburys Collection,Amazing collection of music at a great price. All the songs you'd want and then some! The addition of the dvd is an added bonus.
4,buy this if you don't already have the originals,"George was the catalyst for this all star group. If you did not buy the original discs, consider this one. I do not think the videos are that great. I did not buy it for the DVD. Add this to your collection because we are all heading to the light."
3,Wilbury's okay,"The 2 cd set was good. The first album more contemporary, the second very eclectic. The extras are great!"
4,A Must Have Addition..........,"Unavailable for some time, the Travelling Wilburys in a must have addition to ones CD collection of essential music. The initial offering (CD # 1)is head and shoulders taller then the later issued CD # 2, which is absent the magic of its predecessor. The loss of Roy Orbison was perhaps a factor. The DVD is good, particularly showing the creative process that went into creating the initial offering. It is disappointing in that it only shows 2 live performances from the initial offering. However, worth the price"
5,"Nostalgic, Fun","This package brings some of the best musicians of our time together for some great, fun music."
5,The Traveling Wilburys,I really liked my purchase. When I heard the Traveling Wilburys had just released this CD I looked on BMG and they didn't even have it for sale. I got two CD's and a DVD for a great price of $19.95!
5,Travel to music wonderland with the Wilbury's!,"Rolling stone rated the first of these albums as in the top 100 and I totally agree. What is so wonderful is how this music came to be. Unlike the overproduced, overhyped cr*p that passes for Rock & roll these days. Muscians having fun, isn't that the way it's always supposed to be?I like the bonus DVD. It shows how much fun these guys had making this music. No big studio, just artists jamming in the kitchen! Yeah there are folks on youtube jamming but these guys have talent.It is too bad that more music isn't made this way. So get it while you can, you won't be sorry, and this package is a great deal, (two cd's plus the DVD for the same price as the CD's.)"
5,Adventure with the Wilburys,The Traviling Wilburys Collection was a fantastic find. It's a three disc set 2 cds with a total of 25 remarkable tracks and a DVD of the True History of the Traveling Wilburys. 5 stars is not a good enough rating .....I'm thinking closer to at least 8 stars. I purchsed the set [ASIN:B000P0J024 Traveling Wilburys (2 CD / 1 DVD)]] on Amazon.com
5,Freakin' awesome!!!,"This has got to be the best CD I have heard in a while. The DVD is so cool to watch - but ya gotta like the old ""what music is supposed to be about"" music!!! ENJOY"
5,Loved It,I've always liked the Wilburys and this is the ultimate. The DVD with the history of the band is great!
1,Never happen,Just to say that the item bought was never delivered. Amazon gave me back the money and I tank for it but I really want the material.
3,Misleading photo,"Hello all,I must warn you this is not a kit as the misleading picture would have you believe. You will receive just one PL lens with no holder or lens cap. I was comparing prices and did thought I was getting a deal buying the product pictured. AGAIN beware the picture is misleading you will only receive one lens. The lens you receive is of decent quality it does as the description says."
4,Cavalleria rusticana,"I was pleased to finally find Cavalleria Rustican after a high and low search. This is a rare find to me being that it is such a short opera, it appears that it is rarely available independently. The production is just OK but the music is simply beautiful."
4,A Great Book to Understand Jet Fighter Design,"This is a very good book for people do not have a lot of technical background to understand the key factors of modern jet fighters. This book provides history and development history of almost all trends of jet fighters from the earlier age to the current time. Althought some of the information like Stealthy is available after it published. This is no way to harm the value of this book.For people would like to know how to compare the performance of modern fighters, this is a great place to start."
1,Incorrect Part Number,"Be aware this does not fit the Civic EX or SI even though Amazon says it does. This is for the LX, DX with the smaller dics"
5,Raybestos RC10205Q Quiet Stop Loaded DIsc Brake Calipers,Fast Shipping ... High Quality product ... as described ... installed em ... every thing is as it is supposed to be ... I feel much better about my son being behind the wheel of his honda now ... no more pulling to one side.
2,pedestrian,"Pity - rather pedestrian performance of tartini I don'totherwise know - return to Bianchini, Manze and Wallfisch..."
4,Handy reference,"True, a great deal of the material contained within these pages is now available online. But, having this volume at your desk for handy quick reference to the basics of using the standard template library (STL), is a necessity for anyone hoping to utilize the STL potential. The book is organized in a way that makes sense to experienced software engineers - with container template introductions in one section followed by algorithm introductions in another. The final section contains the STL specification. It is a reference I would not be without and find that I am loaning it often to others who have also noted the benefit of having so much STL information in one volume. A must have for every C++ professional."
3,Not very revealing,"This book is only partially interesting. While the context is interesting, teaching kids excellence through developing and practicing a craft, I found the multitude of personal stories tiresome and uninformative. Really, I think readers can spend their money more wisely."
5,Richer With Each Listen,"As with all of EmmyLou's music it tends to stay in my CD player and become richer with each listen. The songwriting, musianship and production are top-notch, especially the title track, (an economical poem, really), set to music. (Although I didn't catch that Gideon was a 'blue-tick' hound dog until I read the lyrics in the liner notes - now I hear it!) This song is very simple and sparce - with just a few words it conveys a complete world and story.Collaboration seems to bring out the best in Emmylou's work that is continually growing in new directions. This is a very enjoyable CD. Especially good are 'Michaelangelo', 'Tragedy', ""I Don't Want to Talk About It' and 'Boy from Tupelo'."
5,30 + years in the business and now this...,"I have listened to just about every EH recording, from the backing stuff with Gram Parsons through solo, duets,live, backing for Dylan, whatever. This one puts her way beyond the country / rock / folk classifications. I won't review song by song, but if Lilyann (RDG) doesn't make you shed an inner tear then you must have a trouble free life. To understand Michelangelo, you have to understand the context. Fabulous ! I haven't played anything else for months. Play it on a good car stereo, loud, immerse and reflect. That's what the music's for."
3,Only fair,"Love emmylou but this is not one of her best it's okay though, has some good cuts but she has many better"
5,love emmylou,The haunting lyric sounds of Emmylou will be rolling through you head for days after you listen to this. The country rock band makes puts a driving crossover punch into the message.
4,"Peace, Love and Emmylou","What can I say. I've been listening to Emmy since 1974. This album, especially the song Michelangelo, is a credit to her as a lyricist. Michelangelo, in my opinion is exceptional and coupled with her voice, makes for a song I believe will live on for millenia. I listened to another of her songs, ""Boulder to Birmingham"" today. What genius! You have made your indelible mark on me with your music, especially ""Michelangelo"", Emmy. It touched my heart!Peace, love and Emmylou!"
5,Awesome,"Awesome - in the proper sense of the word - as in awe inspiring. Complaining about some nuance of flawed production on this CD is like saying you don't like the cover design on ""The Great Gatsby."" Emmylou's voice is the most expressive and haunting voice creating music today - and the songs she has written on this CD compliment it perfectly. Also, I just met her, and she is gorgeous. The crystaline and sparse guitar work, coupled with Harris' voice and lyrics, make for one of the most impressive, mood-altering CDs I have purchased since...well, I guess since ""Wrecking Ball."""
2,throbbing background,"The cd has too much throbbing instrumental background ""noise"". The reverb and drum machine repetition ruins just about all of the songs. I at first thought there must be something wrong with my stereo, but after replaying the cd on another system came to the conclusion that the problem is with the production and not the sound delivery system. Very headache inducing and distracting ""backing"" to a singer with a marvelous and unique vocal instrument. I wish that Emmylou would get back to basics and deliver her songs with a more spare acoustic backing. How about Emmylou - Red Dirt Girl unplugged? I am going to attempt to filter the ""noise"" and hope that this will make the cd more enjoyable and less annoying.Update 09/23/03: I never went to the trouble to filter the ""noise"" out and just don't ever play the cd. There are plenty of other more enjoyable cds to listen to without being reaggragated by the cluttered sound of this one."
5,One of the best albums I have heard this year,"No words can justify the beauty of Emmylou Harris's voice on this cd. Each song is enchanting, if not heart-wrenching to listen particularly ""My Antonia"" and ""Michaelangelo"". I fell immediately in love with this cd from the moment I heard ""The Pearl"" and all the way down to ""The Boy From Tupelo"". There is such a warmth and richness in Emmylou's voice that you have to listen to this cd as often as possible. It is a good cd to warm up to after being in the harsh winter weather. Very soothing and comforting."
1,Sound quality is terrible.,"And I'm being polite. I've been an Emmylou fan since her first LP, her voice is as vibrant as ever, but whatever that poorly recorded noise is that's behind her, it's as if someone threw cement into a finely tuned machine."
1,Disappointment,"Murky, dark, unmelodic are the words that come to mind. A big fan of hers, I found myself repeatedly comparing these song credits to those of other albums to find to a common difference to blame. No luck. An entire album in minor keys is bound to be depressing. Combined with bad quality, gloomy instrumentation, overbearing bass,etc. it makes for thoroughly unenjoyable listening."
2,Why?,"I just don't get this CD. The production is awful and overdone. It's as if another album underneath this one is begging to be heard, but just can't escape."
1,Piss Poor Recording Makes This CD A Waste Of Money,"All I can say is the lyrics and music and her voice are all great. Unfortunatley the entire CD is ruined by piss poor recording techniques. I don't know what the hell they did when putting these tracks on CD, but the entire CD, especially the best cut on it, Red Dirt Girl, sounds like it was recorded with somebody's dirty t-shirt thrown over the microphone. Absolutely horrendous and inexcusible. This CD is in serious need of re-recording. I wouldn't recommend this CD. The poor sound quality simply ruins the entire listening experience and makes it a wasted purchase. I haven't even listened to it again since the first time I played it. It's THAT bad. Don't waste your time or hard earned money on this CD. If you like Emmylou Harris then buy any of her other CDs. Stay away from this one, you will defininetely be dissappointed in the sound quality and wish you hadn't blown your money on it."
1,Please get back to your roots,"This album is a big disappointment for those of us who love Emmylou's voice and her signature style. As on Wrecking Ball, the electric guitars and fuzzy bass and all the other rock'n'roll claptrap only serve to irritate and obfusticate what are otherwise great songs. Emmylou has written some truly beautiful lyrics and melodies here, but they would be much, much, much nicer if she'd chosen to produce them acoustically. i for one sure hope she gets over this love affair she's having with noisy rock garbage and gets back to making the good, simple music she always used to."
1,What's wrong with Emmylou!,"Ive been a fan of Emmylou Harris ever since buying ""Pieces of the Sky"" on vinyl. I own everything she's recorded. This Cd is almost as bad as Wrecking Ball,but nothing could be that bad. I bought that Cd when it first came out,I couldn't get thru one playing. I retuned to the store the same day I bought it. This Cd has good songs and Emmylou's delivers the lyrics with understandable phrasing. The production on this CD is HORRIBLE. Aside from the overbearing muddy backround with incoherent voice tracks it's filled with production mistakes. You can hear poor track edits,the whirring of I guess a tape machine starting up. It's hard to believe this was produced by ""professionals"". It sounds more like a very poor home recording,unbelievable bad. I wish Emmylou would return to the glory of Roses In The Snow or Thirteen. A real ""country"" band and production in Nashville could have produced a great CD not this sad excuse for music."
1,Please stick to interpretations.,"Emmylou is one of the great interpreters of other songwriters' songs in country music history. Her great albums have been intrepretations of other songwriters' songs. For example ""Pieces Of The Sky"", ""Elite Hotel"", and ""Luxury Liner"". I have most of the albums that Emmylou has released, and they are full of great songs. It hurts me to have to say this: ""Emmylou, please stick to interpretations."" You are a poor songwriter. All of the songs on ""Red Dirt Girl"" are poor songs. All of the songs sound alike (the same melody on every song). Emmylou, I admire your effort to become a songwriter; but sadly, your self penned songs are not good songs. Please Emmylou, go back to recording albums with great songs of outstanding songwriters. Please don't release anymore recordings of your own self penned songs."
1,Emotional virus,"With lyrics like ""It is the heart that kills us in the end / Just one more old broken bone that cannot mend,"" this album is poison to any sensitive person who's trying to recover from heartbreak (like me). The sound is murky, Emmylou's voice is full of anguish, and the lyrics are enough to make you slash your wrists. Music lyrics are like posthypnotic suggestions to me, and I need to be guided to a higher plane at this point in my life. I'm sorry that Emmylou's considerable talent has to be spent lamenting dysfunctional relationship choices (""Rode the streetcar of desire and I paid..."")."
3,"Great songs, lousy sound","I agree with another reviewer who said the sound mixing was poor. I thought it was my player until I took it out and played it in my BOSE in my Infinity and it was just as bad. The songs are wonderful and really touch the soul, but it is hard to understand some of the words which is usually not a problem with Emmy Lou. Yep, I would like a remix."
5,GREAT ALBUM!!!! but why not on VINYL ????,great album! buy it! amazing songs... but I why not on vinyl??? just cd :( please release on vinyl :)
3,Good but not great,"I love Emmylou Harris, but this is not her finest effort. There are some good songs, like the title track and My Antonia, but overall I was somewhat dissappointed. This disc does highlight her excellent band, and several of these songs sound great in cocnert."
2,TWO VERSIONS?,"Reading the other reviews makes me think that there are two versions of this CD out there. The version we received is a BIG disappointment. We love Emmylou; we loved both TRIO CDs and were really excited when we heard that a new CD was on the way. What could be better than Emmylou singing her own songs. The tunes are great and the words are too, but you can't hear them for all of the noise. This thing needs to be remixed and re-issued. I suggest that the new mix be provided free to those of us who bought this version. Yeah, right."
2,"Bleak, pretentious, over-produced","Well, I really wanted to love this album, but I should have known something was awry when the reason I decided to buy it was the cover of ""One Big Love."" Emmylou is not a great songwriter. The worst songs on ""Wrecking Ball"" are the ones she wrote or co-wrote. The corral of geniuses assembled to put this one together is a classic example of too many cooks spoiling the broth. Result: an overseasoned stew of unusually bleak, tired romantic rants. I have loved her before, and probably will again, but she should stick to covers-- and enough with that whiny Daniel Lanois sound-- it was great in the 80s-- but he hasn't innovated. The strangest thing is that I sense a lack of confidence in her own voice in this album-- too much input from others, not enough trust in herself."
2,What's all the buzz about?,"While the lyrics are fascinating, the melody fetching, and the overtones almost haunting, the drum box and echo causes a very annoying buzzing undertone on most of the songs. For a while I even wondered whether it as a defective CD, or whether for some reason I was picking up interference. Maybe that texture to the music will sink in and become an asset, but be warned."
3,I Thought I Was Losing My Hearing,"I am glad to hear that I was not the only person who identified a problem with sound quality. Oh, and was this Stevie Nicks of Fleetwood Mac or Emmylou Harris singing. I enjoy country music but this hardly qualifies. Still, a couple of the tunes are well done and Ms. Harris has a one-of-a-kind voice."
5,New Favorite,I've always said Wrecking Ball is my all time favorite album....and then I heard Red Dirt Girl. Amazing! The Daniel Lanois influence is definitely there.
2,Red Dirt Girl,"This was so disappointing - if I had been told it was a Julie Miller album I would've believed it. Heavy background, what's happened to Emmylou's lovely voice and unspoilt music. I wish I hadn't bought it. I shall continue to play my old Emmylous but this Red Dirt Girl will just gather dust."
2,Muffled Sound Quality,"I bought Red Dirt Girl shortly after it was released because I had heard the title track on a review and liked the words. I was very disappointed when I tried to listen to the CD. The music sounds so muffled. I thought there was something wrong with my copy of the CD until I read the comments of a couple of other reviewers who have had the same experience. I rarely listen to this CD, even though I do like some of the songs, because of the poor quality of the recording; it simply gets on my nerves."
4,for real,"All you guys mumbling about production-this is high-definition CD,so check can you play HDCD at all,instead of spiting a poison around.Malcolm Burn actually did a good job here.A kind of last goodbuy,i think,last waltz,her last song...maybe I'm wrong,but somehow it's a full circle.Sad and beautiful,dark and open-hearted."
1,Disappointing - not worth the money!,This was my first purchase of an Emmylou recording - very poor quality sound and music. Not what I expected of her she is so much better than this. Watching her on Austin City Limits is a pleasure - this album is a total disaster - I have one of these to sell!
2,Boring,"I thought Wrecking Ball was ok with some really great songs and several duds - the production was muddy but fit several of the songs. Unfortunately she has continued with the very muddy production sound here which would be ok with great songs, but here the songs are just BORING. They all sound the same! zzzzzzzzzzzz Avoid."
4,Great writing,"RED DIRT GIRL follows Emmylou's award-winning album, WRECKING BALL. RED DIRT GIRL isn't quite as good, but it's still pretty good.I am really happy that Emmylou wrote most of the songs on the album. It is hard for me to respect an artist who only sings other people's songs most of the time. Not only is Emmylou writing her songs, she is writing really good songs. ""The Pearl"" is brilliant, as is ""Boy from Tupelo."""
5,Who Knew?,"While I've heard samplings of her writing before,usually with someone collaborating, nothing prepared me for the incredibly beautiful lyrics on this cd. The production is a bit fuzzy for my taste but almost all the songs are beautifully written, especially ""Red Dirt Girl"", ""Michaelangelo"", ""The Pearl"", ""My Antonia"", It gets better with each and every listening. I've been a huge fan for 25 years and I thought I've heard it all. Sound like she's just beginning.She's come a long way since ""The Bottle Let Me Down !!!"
2,Malcolm Burns with Emmylou Harris,"Next time I'll listen closer to customer reviews than NPR. Last album I bought by Emmylou Harris was Roses in the Snow. I guess she has changed her style or someone has changed it for her. Songs are brooding and depressing- production is ponderous and fuzzy. Some credits list 3 or 4 assignments by the same musicians- that's not Emmylou's style. Burn must have dubbed this sucker dozens of times and it shows. ""Instruments"" listed include drum box programming, EBow, and mando cello. You really have to hear this one to believe it. Burns is credited in notes for Programming and Treatment- he sure gave Emmyou the treatemnt."
3,Everybody has a point,"Great lyrics v. overdone production; wonderful artistry v. too much bass; they're all right in my view. Emmylou's a marvelous talent, but it's her unique vocal quality that draws me to her work. On the first pass, I just about tossed this cd. That vocal quality that sets her apart was lost in the over production; on subsequent listens I'm able to tune the cliche production out and my enjoyment has been growing. My thought: before buying, listen to some sample cuts and form your own opinion. I don't think the production is as artistic and ""envelope stretching"" as Emmylou's vocal styling or writing."
4,Maybe Her Finest,"She's the queen of alterna-country, or adult-countremporary, or whatever the hip music guys are calling it these days. Let's just call this album some of the most hauntingly beautiful music you will have heard this year. When one thinks of Emmylou Harris one thinks of those pure, sweet vocals very much of this world, this country, yet somehow otherworldly, angelic, ethereal. Here, in addition, she reminds us what a fine songwriter she is. These are songs of passion, longing, spirit, and love. Songs of God, and the Devil, and the In-Between. Malcolm Burn's production is just right. Over the years, Emmylou has sung with virtually any artist worth his/her salt. Here she unites with Dave Matthews in a lovely duet and even recruits Mr. and Mrs. Springsteen to join her in another. Maybe her finest album."
3,GREAT SONGSTRESS LOST IN SOUND MIXER,"Don't get me wrong - Emmylou's talent is still undisputed, and her songwriting has never been stronger. Sadly, her vocal integrity is overwhelmed by some of the WORST sound mixing that I've ever heard. You don't need a high-end system to detect this, and I would guess that the muddy and droning sound quality is even more pronounced on low end stereo systems.Let's look forward to the next Emmylou - or even a re-mix of this Emmylou. I'm ready to find the sound engineer, and ask HIM for my money back. Buy Trio Two instead - it's just lovely."
4,art with blemishes,"I recently came to Emmylou through her work with some of my heroes, Mark Knopfler and Neil Young. I've been digesting this disk and several of her others. In reading the comments, I see that some people just love this album and others love it but hate the production and the sound. I'm here to say that the complainers have a point: the purity of Emmylou on this album is marred by some immature over-production, and a few lurches over the line into pop, e.g., it is a little heavy on the drum machines. But it is just a scratch. I can also say that it does not sound as good as the later Stumble Into Grace, but the sound is not unusually bad either. And it is still well worth the price of admission. There is not a weak track on the disk. The title track is essential and note-perfect, and I would not be without several of the others. Emmylou is the real deal, and these are her songs. Do not be deterred."
4,WOW!!!,"For tried and true Emmylou Harris fan's, this album is a real treat. She wrote or co-wrote nearly every song on the album. It was worth waiting 12 years for another album with this many originals on it. If you thought she was a convincing interpreter of other people's songs, just wait 'til you hear her perform her very own. The production still maintains the atmospheric simplicity of Wrecking Ball and, for the new material, it's quite fitting. Give it a couple of listens and you'll be singing these songs in the shower in no time."
3,"Lyrically strong, vocally beautiful","but instrumentally it is muddled and mushy. I agree with another reviewer that it's almost as if there's another ""album"" underneath this one. I bought this a short while after buying and falling in love with Cowgirl's Prayer, so I know that Red Dirt Girl is a radical departure. I'll probably hear something from Red Dirt Girl in a few months and get hooked, but for now . . . I'm sticking with Emmylou's more traditional stuff. But, hats off to her for stretching out."
2,Excellent songwriting - poor production,"I thought the songs on this album were almost all terrific. But to come to this conclusion required repeated listening, as the production quality was so poor. Too much background noise covering her fine voice - another victim of the ""technology rules"" attitude threatening the music industry."
2,Awful Production! Where's the great voice?,"I have everything Emmylou has ever done. This is by far the worst production I have heard on any of her albums. The song-writing is fine, but mostly what I want to hear is the richness and complexity of her voice. Alas the incessant drums and guitars just over-ride everything. I think the producer was on an ego trip. I can't find a way to hear more of her voice and less of the thumping that dominates everything. Please bring back Daniel Lanois or Brian Ahern. The songs are fine - I love ""The Pearl"", ""Michelangelo"" and ""Red Dirt Girl"", and the rest are as good as or better than most other artists I hear. She says her concerts now concentrate on tracks from this album and ""Wrecking Ball"". I hope to see her in Auckland in April 2001. I have my fingers crossed that either the live concert is better than this poor quality CD, or she does the majority of her numbers from ""Wrecking Ball""."
2,OVER PRODUCED,"I HATE TO GIVE A POOR REVIEW OF AN EMMYLOU HARRIS RECORDING AND I WILL QUALIFY THE POOR RATING BY SAYING THAT I LOVE THE SONGS BUT HATE THE BACKGROUND MUSIC. THE SHIMMERING GUITARS AND ANNOYING ECHO TAKE AWAY FROM A BEAUTIFUL VOICE AND POTENTIALLY INTERESTING SONG WRITING. AS MUCH AS I TRY TO CONCENTRATE ON THE VOICE AND LYRICS, I AM UNABLE TO DO SO BECAUSE THE REST OF THE ""STUFF"" JUST GETS IN THE WAY. WHAT A WASTE."
2,Not What I'd Hoped For,"I count myself among the die-hard fans when it comes to Emmylou. And like many of them, I was thrilled when she was expanding her horizons with Wrecking Ball. And now she's deservedly fashionable, at least among the cognoscenti; hey there was even an article in The New York Times Magazine.But I find red Dirt Girl disappointing. Yes the ""new sound"" is still there with its pulsating guitar and drum rhythms. But Emmylou seems to me to fall in the same hole as many other great singers who decide to write their own material. . . lyrics that contain too many cliches, and non-existent melody. Each song on this disc sounds too much like the one that preceded it and the one that follows. There's not one song that one hums after the disc finishes. Maybe I'm a traditionalist or simply narrow-minded, but I like some tunes, especially when there's as radiant a voice as Emmylou's. I have no problem with the dark-hued lyrics, but they and the rhythms don't make for great songs."
2,"Why listen to this when you can play ""Blue Kentuckey Girl""?","I am glad for her that she is at a point where she can record the music she wants to record - without worrying about its popularity. On the other hand, this is probably the last Emmylou Harris I'll ever buy because I don't want to hear this type of sound from her.I don't understand why someone would want to take her unique voice and cover it up with so much going on in the background. At least for me, it just doesn't work and her recent work just pales horribly to albums like ""Pieces of the Sky"" and ""Elite Hotel"". I'd prefer to see her make an entire duet album with Don Williams - now that would be something to get excited about. Another album with thumping drums in the background and heavy bass covering up her voice - just does not excite me."
3,PFFR?,"I've become a fan of PFFR. I love Wondershowzen, Xavier, Renegade Angel, Delocated, and Heart She Holler. All of the humor produced by this company has been off the wall and thought provoking. But, I found it really difficult to get into Final Flesh. Supposedly, this is surreal humor designed for intellectuals to laugh AT the actual porn stars in the ""movie"" as they struggle to act or parrot their lines. The dialog primarily consists of pseudo psycho-sexual blather, the oppressiveness of money and the government, musings about God, dreams, the finality of this mortal coil, and the nature of the soul. Visual symbolism, within the first 10 minutes, seems contrived, and as the movie drags on, becomes utterly confusing as it becomes apparent that the film makers are in love with their own message. Perhaps it's an inside joke? Perhaps I just don't get it. But, regardless, I shall keep this DVD next to my other PFFR offerings and impatiently wait for Delocated, season 3."
4,Great bike rack for my Jeep,"Purchased the rack for my Jeep Wrangler, needed the extension to clear the rear tire. Work great, very secure. My only complaints, does not come with hitch pin ( need to buy a locking pin anyway, Masterlock sells them ), and only one key for the lock on the bike rack. I always like to have a spare."
2,"Browse through it at a library or bookstore, but don't buy!","The first part of the book (on crusing) is informative, but the second part of the book (on cruise ships) is flat. Be forewarned: reviews of same-class ships on each of the cruise lines read the same! ""The Unofficial Guide to Cruises 2002"" far outshines this book, which capitalizes on Douglas Ward's name and forsakes quality."
2,Made a Mistake,"I really like the country singer, Josh Thompson; and his new CD, ""Way Out Here,"" is great. I figured I'd get his earlier stuff, and got a copy of ""Josh Thompson,"" assuming this was one of his earlier CDs. Problem is, it's not the same guy! Just someone else with the same name. He obviously put his heart and soul into this CD, but it's not particularly good."
4,"eazy to install,very loud!","This item is great for a large house, eazy to install. 4 stars only because the push button is cheap plastic. Or it would have had 5 stars. (you can buy others but it shoud come all together to make 5 stars."
1,Note to Zenith Quality Control,This low grade plastic lacks quality. When you change the battery the plastic base that holds the cover can easily brake or if your kid accidentally bumps it. I would not recommend this product.
2,Failed after a year,"Looks nice, works fine, but died after a year. Changing batteries did not help. It's just not a quality piece of equipment. Maybe you will have better luck."
2,Door bell,"Fast delivery, bell looks real pretty, but uses batteries up, then stopped working after 4 months, so I now use original bell that came with Chime Box.. 2yeara and bell still works.m can be replaced and easy to find batteriesThis bell is nice looking but won't last..."
2,Description misleading.,"The description of this item says it is a ""satin brass finish"". It does not mention that the product is plastic, which it is. Description should say it is ""plastic with a satin brass finish"". My mistake...not questioning the fact that the description did not claim that the product is brass. I guess brass finish means plastic!"
1,Junk,"The rubber push button on this model must be pressed very hard; take it apart and you'll see it's a design defect, not just that you have a bad one. Good thing we also have an old fashioned brass doorknocker! CR1220 watch batteries are very difficult to replace; the problem is getting a good contact. The ugly white buttons with the A23 12v battery are much more reliable. I would not recommend any model with the watch batteries. You have to wonder if the management of Heath Zenith ever tried the product."
1,One year and dead,"I love the failure mode for this thing. 1am and started signaling the chime non-stop. The ""brass"" finish was already coming off and the true cheap plastic underneath showed through. Why is everything junk today?"
3,Works - but not what I expected,"The wireless doorbell does just what its advertised to do, and seems to do it well. However, for the price I would have expected an actual brass part, but brass painted plastic. Plus the directions are, well, cryptic."
4,why no blue ray?,"I think this was filmed in 1080i high definition so I can not figure out why they are not releasing this in the blue ray dvd format, obviously the sound quality would be much better, and the already good video would be much better, there are many BOC fans and it goes without saying that this would sell like hot cakes"
5,"Wordy, but accurate","Having authored my own book on meeting and succeeding with women, ""From the First Date to the Bedroom, the Single Man's Official Guide to Success with Women,"" I can fully appreciate John Gray's work.Whereas my book is a light-hearted approach to dating and mating from the male perspective, I will tell you that John does a womderful job in this more serious work. It is definitely worth the time to read.Butch Mazzuca,Author, From the First Date to the Bedroom, the Single Man's Official Guide to Success with Women,"""
3,Not sold on it.,"This book makes some good points but also makes it seem like each party in the relationship is a child that needs to be coddled. Instead of sending a message of respect and caring, instead for a relationship to work one party must completely give in and baby the other. At times the communication it suggests seems condescending and ridiculous. The other difficult part of this book is getting the other half of the relationship to read it and then read it and say ok I'm doing this wrong not.... see I'm right you are doing this wrong and thats why I act the way I do. It has nothing to do with me I need my ""cave"" time and you aren't supposed to disturb me and if you do its normal for me to get mean. I think this book gives men alot of convenient excuses for unexcusable behavior and blames womens problems too much on the fact that they took mens roles at work and weren't meant to biologically."
5,Dr. Grey's Books are The Bomb!,"I bought 3 of these books for a Friend of mine, who doesn't have a romantic bone in his body. He now lives in another state. I'm sending him these books after I have read all 3. The one I'm reading now is great!Thanks, Cindy"
3,Another sequel without much value-add,"I'm a big fan of the original Mars/Venus book. But the follow-ons, including this one, really add very little to the discussion. This one could be somewhat helpful as a further discussion of the ideas, but don't expect any new insights."
4,Very good except...,"It doesn't puree the drink as much as I would like but I still recommend it. It looks mean but it's not sharp which is good because it's not likely to cut you when you wash it but isn't as effective as it could be. It will push the drink out of the blender with great force and doesn't create that annoying frost on top of the blender. It will blend even the thickest shake. it does crush ice and is my ""go to"" smoothie maker. If it were sharp I'd gives this 5 stars but I can't use it for things like frozen strawberries as well as I would like however it's wonderful for fresh fruits. I make drinks for my daughter that consist of Yogurt, Milk, Quinoa, baby food, Bananas and various fruits. Even adults like these ""shakes"" and if you go low fat they're quite healthy."
4,Super Aerator,"This product will put a lot of air in your milk shakes. But you will have to pre-crush any ice cubes in a towel, because it cannot crush ice cubes well. Very good for milk shakes, not so good for smoothies (unless you pre-crush the ice)."
2,broke after 7 months,"Works fairly well for making fruit smoothies, but the top blade broke off after just 7 months. Had it not broken, I would have rated it 4 stars."
3,OK but not for banna shake,Wife made me put the other blade back on. She makes a banana shake most mornings to take to work and says this blade just ain't as good as the regular blade. We'll keep it for ice cream shakes.
1,bad item,The design of the blade caused the motor in my mixer to get very hot. Switched to normal blade and all was fine. Tested it twice!!
2,Cheap but doesn't last.,This made great smoothies and shakes but the tabs on top broke off after a couple weeks of use. The bottom blade is loose but doesn't spin freely. For the price I might buy another to see if this was a fluke.
3,"Great item, but not completely necessary...","This item works very well. It leaves less froth/foamy surface when you make the drink.I have been using this to make my protein shakes, which include whey protein powder, milk, and ice cream. Every now and then I will add some fruit or syrup (caramel or chocolate). It blends everything together very well.I would only say that it is not SUPERB or AMAZING as to the job it can do when making the shakes. It still leaves a little frothy/foam on the top...but not as much as a regular blade.PROS: Cheap, gets the job done, looks fancyCONS: Not extremely necessary to make milk shakes. The regular blade will make milk shakes just fine without it.SUMMARY: Only purchase if you have the spare cash to spend on it. I would not label this item as a pure necessity for milk shakes. But it does do a nice job."
3,Not what I expected,I guess I thought the edges would be sharper so that this blade would cut through frozen fruit. I don't see much point in using it most of the time. Maybe it's effective for people who use ice cream as a base for their shakes... but I'd rather eat ice cream than drink it!
3,It works fine - not much different than original blade,My grandson said he doesn't see much difference between this blade and the one that came with the blender. He uses it to make protein shakes.
3,Not great but not awful,I've found this blade doesn't have the capacity to pulverize even small ice cubes which I sometimes add to my milkshakes to make them thicker. Always wind up with chunks of ice. The regular Oster blade does a much better job (in my opinion).
3,It's ok for shakes...does not thin out the shake too much,"So the only blade I had for my oster blender is the one that comes for chopping up ice. I used that primarily for everything from making shakes to cutting up ice to grinding nuts, etc.I eventually bought this blade for my shake. I'm ok with it. It does not thin out the shake as much as the ""default"" ice blade does. The shake is a bit thicker...but not by much. I'm also not a fan that it does not blend fruit pieces all that well - I mean, it does, but your still left with chunks.Overall though - I do use this for making shakes, and while the shake has improved in texture...well...it ain't Dairy Queen. I'm ok with it, but if this blade wears out/breaks...well...i wouldn't re-purchase it again, and simply go back use the default blade that came with the blender."
4,Oster Frozen Yogurt Coffee Wand,"I make a Frozen Yogurt/Coffee drink with this blade and my Osterizer Pro blender with pre-programmed setting. Makes delicious, creamy, strong coffee concoction. Drink 3 a day, with a meal of solid food @ dinner plus a Nature's Own Crunchy Granola Bar or 3 or 4 Great Value Oatmeal Cookies an hour or two before hitting the sack and have lost 20 pounds over last 6 to 12 months. Still dropping the odd pound and picking up 8 ounces depending on how active I have been during the course of the week.I have been a runner, swimmer, hiker, worked out with weights or just walked the dog for most of the last 35 years. Got older, and less active but still had the appetite of a very active person. Got fat on ice cream sandwiches, but found a diet that keeps me at a healthy weight. Oster Blender and blade are a big part of weight maintenance solution."
3,still not like the ice cream shops,great quality product from Oster. Unfortunately I have yet to discover a blender that creates smooth thick creamy milkshakes like you get from ice cream places.
2,No better than the original blade,"This doesn't work as you would expect. The instructions even state to push the stuff down into the blade to make it work. Thats what I have to do with the regular blade anyway, so where's the win on this?"
4,Wonderful-make fluffy shakes,I like this blade because it mixes faster and fluffier than the standard blade. Also eliminates the frequency of needing to stop the blender and push around ice cubes or frozen fruit to get the blades un-stick when items get stuck beneath blades.
3,Decent: Not nearly as good as The Wire,"Let me be clear: Treme is a good show. It is not great. The difference between HBO series Treme, the Wire, Six Feet Under, and Game of Thrones is that The Wire, Six Feet Under and Game of Thrones have characters you can't help but fall in love with. Treme, though the cast is great, does not develop those one or two--in the case of The Wire, those dozen--characters whose 0n-screen deaths will bring tears to your eyes. The focus is the music, and the music is good, but as a result, in too many cases, the characters are cliched and one-dimensional. I stopped watching after the third or fourth episode of season two.I'll say this though: It is probably damn near impossible to dream up another masterpiece like The Wire. I tip my hat to David Simon for even giving it a try."
3,treme,"the quality of the cd was first rate, the ""box"" was in poor shape, but since the gift was for my son, he understood that I had purchased it with ""an eye"" to the price. I would use them again unless it was for a gift where the ""box mattered""!Treme: The Complete First Season"
4,All TV series should be produced this good,"Great series. The story line is good, plus lots of good exposure to aftermath of hurricane. believable characters, great music ."
4,Slow moving but great!,This is a slow moving series but worth the effort. Give it a try you wont be disappointed. One to watch
3,ball of confusion,"We were looking forward to seeing this series, especially after seeing The Wire, also by David Simon, but after several episodes it is obvious that this is not the same caliber show as The Wire. If the intent is convey the depression and despair which followed in the aftermath of Katrina, then it succeeds. However, I personally find the direction lacking and feel that many times a very flimsy script is being fleshed out to fill up the time required to make a complete episode. The acting is very good and the characters are interesting and we are trudging along into Season 2 in hopes that this beast finally rises above the bar which is set so low."
4,Her most far-reaching and sophisticated recording yet,"In what might be her most far-reaching and sophisticated recording yet, Miriam Makeba reaches way back to the 1950s, and all the decades in between, re-recording some of her biggest hits and mixing them into an international stew of lovely, well-written songs that show off as never before just what a great singer she truly is with REFLECTIONS.The arrangements are slick, but only occasionally too slick for my taste (i.e. violins on the fadeout to a Mbaquanga song)."
5,Not for the Beginners,"This book is not for the average soccer-coaching-book buyer. This book gives an in-depth look at zone play in both the attack and the defense plus training to do so. This book would best be used no less than at the U-14/16 with experienced coaches. Angelo Pereni and Michele DiCesare had their book translated from Italian to English better that most translated books I've come across. However, beware that you will be reading a book written by aficionados to provoke thought as well tactics. For those who love chess as well as soccer, this is a great book. The book was first published as ""Calico: II manuale tecnico e tattico dell'allentore"". It was a pleasure reading a book coming from a culture where soccer is as big as the NFL, MBA and MLB combined. I will certainly be using the information from this book and look forward to a sequel as the game continues to evolve."
1,Horrible! Horrible!!!,"This is by far the worst production of HMS Pinafore I have ever had the misfortune to see. Simply put it is not Gilbert and Sullivan. The genius of Gilbert has been destroyed by silly nonsense, sight gags, pratfalls, pants loosing and boob jokes, there is also a goofy added plot line with Dick Deadeye and Queen Victoria (who turns up at the end) and Sullivan's score is just about unrecognizable. There are long (albeit well-performed) meaningless dance sequence inserted in the oddest places (the tap dance right at the dramatic climax of the 2nd act for example). In a nutshell, the core issue is simply one of respect - it is obvious that there was no respect for or trust in the original work of the team of Gilbert and Sullivan. I found this production to be - in words of Gilbert, which were cut from this production: ""Horrible, Horrible!"""
1,Sinking the good ship Pinafore,"I have not seen this DVD, but watched the PBS television broadcast. I really wanted to turn it off at the end of Act One, but the interval was short, so I stayed till the bitter end. Oh dear. I didn't mind the re-orchestration as much as the deliberate alteration of virtually every tempo indication and note value. In the amount of time it took the arranger to trash Sullivan's score, he could have written something of his own. By comparison, Gilbert's book and lyrics were relatively untouched, and it's worth noting that none of the ""improvements"" got as big laughs as the author's original jokes. Some of the performers are quite capable, and some viewers might enjoy this for what it is, but is is NOT Gilbert and Sullivan's H.M.S. Pinafore."
1,Apallingly bad revivial,"The Guthrie theater is renowned for innovation. This production -- from conception to execution -- was just a bad idea. Take the plot line and the melody, and then put it through a meat-grinder with arrangements and orchestrations straight out of Andrew Lloyd Weber. What do you get? Not a very appealing meal -- just a pile of mush.The production values were fine, the casting and costumes fine. But musically, it was just an abortion. The dancing and ""acting"" could not have been more gay. Well, let me be more specific here: almost everyone who does Gilbert and Sullivan these days may be gay, and that's fine. But this particular style, I'd just rather they were back in the closet.All the cleverness and wit of G&S; are just washed away here. I'm sorry, this is just a POS that shouldn't have been made."
3,My 8 year old granddaughter loves it,"I purchased this as a birthday gift for my granddaughter after seeing the Pinafore production on PBS. Even though my granddaughter doesn't fully understand the story line, she loves to dance to the music."
2,Seriously lacking,"I've been a Gilbert & Sullivan fan all of my life (I'm 70 years old) and I've seen nearly all of the DVD versions of this opera. My great-grandmother, Carrie W. Wilcox, performed in HMS Pinafore in 1889 (Little Buttercup). This is the least appealing of the lot of them. I think it was an honest effort but just not up to par. The casting was poor, the set mediocre and the singing and music just not quite satisfactory."
5,Excellent Eceryday Watch,"I've been searching my local stores for this Timex model with numbers only and no calendar feature for some time now. The price right, the shipping was 2-3 days and the item was exactly as described. I couldn't be happier with this purchase."
4,not bad,"It doesn't cool the air by 30 degrees and the mist isn't super fine, but it does make you feel cooler. This is probably about as good as it gets for feeling cool without a/c. If you don't use all the water at once it leaks out, so that kinda sucks. But definitely worth having. I threw away my personal air cooler by sharper image. This thing actually works. It helps for around 15 minutes or so in an indoor environment. I am definitely happy with my purchase. And you can't beat the price."
3,Beware if you ware glasses...,"This item works as advertised - just don't be wearing glasses when you do use it. The mist is very fine and refreshing, but impractical if you wear perscription glasses (regular or sunglasses) because you will have to remove them to wipe them clean everytime. I bought this because I have no AC in my car in S. Fla. and hoped to use it to cool down while driving. Needless to say, I cannot use it when the car is moving, because I do not have windshild wipers on my eyeglass frames. Otherwise, it gets the job done."
1,is this a joke?,"All I can say about this cd is that it must have been done by people who thought they had talent. While they may be able to carry a tune (at least well enough for a junior high musical), they will never have the incredible sound and tone that Josh Groban has. And whats with that blatant attempt to make the cover guy appear like a Groban look-alike? Face it, no one is in his class. He is a rare talent."
1,Are you kidding me?,"Ok, the thought was nice, but a tribute album? Already? And when you don't even compare to Josh himself, this is so not even worth it. Don't buy this album. I listened to all the clips and it was awful. You'd be much better off spending your money on a real Josh album. Or all of them, let's go with that. Two thumbs down."
1,American Idol move over!!!!!!,"Are these the losers from American Idol???This has got to be the best thing I have heard all year!!!Where the hell did they find these rejects???Better yet where the hell did they find the producer for this mess. I cannot believe that people would actually waste time and money to make such a horrific attempt at a ""tribute"" Josh Groban.Pack your bags Josh, there may be some competition down the line for you. NOT!!!!!!!!What a joke!!!If you even think about spending half a red cent for this crap send it to me instead and I will make a donation on your behalf to a Josh Groban charity event, at least someone would benefit.Josh is the ""ONE AND ONLY"""
1,"Hopefully, a JOKE.","Honestly, I don't know who gave this person their own album. This is not a tribute to Josh Groban, it's taking his music, stomping on it, spitting on it, and then processing it through a microphone. Buy the real thing, people. Josh Groban is incredible."
1,THIS IS A SCAM- NO STAR given,"This should be illegal and Amazon should have no part in it!! This is no ""tribute"" attempt but rather an obvious scam trying to trick people not totally knowledgable about Josh Groban into mistakenly buying this CD instead of Josh's. The partial picture on the cover has enough similarities to Groban's physical appearance that adds to the evidence that this is a premeditated attempt at scamming people. No review of the singing is necessary since presenting music is not the purpose of this CD."
1,Tribute (?) to Josh Groban,"Well, bless my soul - I didn't know William Huang did a ""tribute"" (and I use that term loosely) to Josh Groban. Singing quality is about the same, although William is perhaps a little better. Give me a break. Some poor guy is delusional enough to think that he can sing ala Josh Groban. No way - ever. You'll notice the guy's name is not available - is it? I looked around but couldn't find it."
1,"As Simon Cowell would say, ""that was absolutely horrific""","It was so painful to listen to the audio samples of this so-called tribute CD. Especially the versions of ""My Confession"" and ""Si Volvieras a Mi"" The guy's Spanish is a disgrace! I myself took 4 years of Spanish in high school, and granted I can't speak it fluently; I can at least get the pronunciation right!! This CD makes you really appreciate the talent that is Josh Groban, because he can not be duplicated. With songs in English, Spanish, Italian, EVEN French; Josh sings them with perfection and grace. Don't buy this CD. Save your money for the upcoming Closer DVD!!"
1,"Great Effort, but not a great job!","Oh my Gosh!! This was horrible. The people's effort was certainly there, but did anyone mention to them that it sucks?¿? These people sound nothing liek Josh. They sound like wanna-be-josh's. I sing horribly, but even I sing better in the shower! Save yourself the irritation and buy the real Josh!"
1,LAME,"I can't believe I actually considered buying this...THANK GOODNESS for audio samples. I feel bad ruining Josh's voice when I try to sing the songs but at least I'm not out trying to make money off of it!This totally sounds like a high school musical gone terribly wrong...blech. It certainly is an insult to those of us who know the true, amazing talent of Josh for this CD to be considered a tribute."
1,Is This CD Made by Comedians?!,"This collection of music sounds like the losers of a high school talent show. The only saving grace of this CD is that maybe, just maybe, it was made by comedians going for the laugh. That is the only reason I can figure anyone would subject themselves to such humiliation. In short, it is HORRIBLE--tone deaf singers with cheesy production, trying to sound like Josh Groban. What some people won't do for a buck. Sheesh."
1,There's even someone impersonating Josh on the cover!,"If you look closely, I am fairly sure that the person on the cover is NOT Josh Groban. Although that is an outfit Josh would wear, they cut off his face because it isn't even him. I agree with the other reviews that this CD is an absolute atrocity. I've seen Josh live three times and even at his worst, he is a thousand times better than whoever on earth these people are. They couldn't even pronounce the words correctly in ""Si Volvieras a Mi""!!! Don't buy this at all. Don't go near it unless you want a good laugh."
1,AHHHH!!!!!,"This does not even deserve the one star! This is no tribute... this is trash. I am ashamed of these people. It is one thing to sing his songs, but it is a completely different story when they make a cd of it. All I can say is, boy wait until you have gone through puberty and then give it another try. Just stay away from Josh's music. It ruins such a good thing. They are songs that should NOT be replicated. I love Josh Groban and he deserves to remain one of a kind. Those of you that see this, buy the real thing. His self-titled cd and ""Closer"" are out of this world. They take me to another demension. They are truely the best I have ever heard."
2,What were they thinking,"I gave this thing two stars not because it's any good, but because when you hear it you'll laugh. You know when you go to a karaoke bar full of drunk people and they decide to sing, and then you sit there and laugh so hard that your sides ache. Yeah, this cd is just like that. It's really funny. It however was not funny enough to spend money on. Hey what is that thing on the cover? It looks like a curly haired woman in a sweater. I mean I know Josh is thin and all, but that was just wrong to put that picture on there, but I guess he heard the cd and was like, don't put my face on that."
1,Disgusting.,"This is horrible! I can't believe someone would actually record this. Poor Josh. Whoever this guy is that is singing, well... he certainly doesn't know how to sing. There's only one Josh in this world and this album doesn't do him justice."
1,What were they thinking?,"This isn't a tribute TO Josh Groban, it's an ill-thought-out grab ontohis coattails. Jeeze... I just cringed at every single sample. There's nothingof value on this disc, unless you enjoy shoddy singers and poor productions."
1,"MY EARS, MY POOR EARS!!","NO STARS!!! I can't even begin to express how terrible this so called tribute album sounds. Thankfully, I listened to the samples first. I suggest you do the same, before you think about buying this CD. Seriously, the others are right, why would you buy this mess when you could have the real Josh? And, um, I thought ""tributes"" were for those performers' careers that have been really really long, or were dead. Josh is neither of these, he is alive and well and young with a very long career ahead of him. GO BUY A REAL JOSH GROBAN CD!!!"
1,What is up with this?,I find it hilarious that they would call this a tribute to Josh Groban. They would pay him tribute by not desecrating the songs he has sung so beautifully. They only wish they had his incredible voice. I agree. Why buy this when you can have the real thing. What a waste of time.
1,An Insult to Josh Groban's BEAUTIFUL Voice,"This is pathetic, and it makes my ears bleed! I can not believe these people butchered Josh Groban's BEAUTIFUL, SOULFUL Songs this way. Please, go buy the real thing it is a million times better than this!"
1,Oh Lord,"The symphony backing these ""singers"" were beautiful. I couldn't find one person who could even carry a tune, let alone shine or become a star in their own right. I hate sounding like Simon Cowl, but oh my God!! The songs are the only thing that helped me past these truly awful singers. The Live at the Greek CD/DVD would be a much better way to spend your money. I'm sure these ""singers"" had the best intensions, but..... no.... just say no."
1,Oh my goodness! I'm confused!,"Nobody beats Josh Groban's voice. First I was laughing my heart out and later, realized that it seems as if some of the songs were purposely sung in the ugliest way ever thought possible. Or maybe the singers sang that way to show how awesome and wonderful Josh's (strong, beautiful and controlled) voice is comparing to theirs. ""Si Volvieras a Mi"" was poorly sung & pronounced with sometimes French or English accent and I think it's a shame that this is actually out there in the open for people to purchase it. People, please buy the ones that were sung by the one and only Josh Groban. Thank you very much. ...Insulted and confused..."
1,Who's idea was this?,Why oh why would anyone buy this if they could buy the REAL thing!!! Trust me this guy (whoever he is)CANNOT SING.Just listening to the samples was enough to give me a headache.Please just go buy josh's first cd.
1,OMJ...That is so Bad,"I was so curious on what the tribute was about. Welp as they say curiousity killed the cat. This CD is so bad. It's as if they are recording a person who is singing Josh Groban's songs in a kareoke bar. That is how bad this CD is. This person cannot even hit any of the high notes to any of Josh's songs. I think that it was the producer's waste of time and money to make a CD using this guy. At least use Josh's original voice if u were to make a compilation CD of all his songs. In short, I give this CD a -20 out of 10, showing how embarrased and disgraced of this Josh wannabe CD."
1,*blink*,"This was a tribute? Was this under humour? I dunno but this certainly was not a tribute to Josh.I was looking at the Greek CD/DVD, saw this under recommendations and decided to take a look at it.Si Volverias a Mi almost made me wanna cry, it was so bad. I mean, I took French in high school, not Spanish, but just by listening to Josh sing it, I can pronounce it better than the guy who sang on this ""tribute"" can.And the guy's even trying to look like Josh on the cover! Oh goodness, me.Listen to me and the other Grobanites when we say, if you want the real thing, real talent, buy JOSH GROBAN."
1,Not even amusing...,"This is NOT a tribute to Josh. The samples show it to be so bad that it seems as if this guy is trying to degrade Josh. I don't know why---Josh only brings joy to anyone who hears him. I hope nobody is fooled into buying this by the title. I agree with other reviewers who wish there was a ""zero star"" category."
1,ABSOLUTELY PAINFUL..Who the hell gave this guy a record deal,"Thankfully, i read the reviews on this album BEFORE i decided whether to buy it or not, AND i listened to the samples, which are even more helpful - a true motivation to make you sick or even to make you laugh your heart out at this horrible and sad immitation of Josh (i mean, really, is this a joke or what? i'll be damned if it isn't!!!!) When You Say You Love Me - a favorite song of mine (WHEN IT'S PERFORMED BY JOSH) - was just excruciating to the ears and to the heart... si volvierasa mi was even worse (AAHHHH!!!) This all may sound mean, but i'm just not able to handle such a horrible mock (if it is a mock)to Josh Groban..no, no,NO!! Please do not buy this album...you'll probably end up selling it someplace else or throwing it away. Please, please, PLEASE buy the real thing and listen to the real Josh Groban."
2,why not just buy Josh?,I don't know who is singing on this album but it isn't Josh. Why would you want to buy an album of Josh songs by someone you don't know and who isn't as good as Josh? (sorry random guy) I also think it's a bit early to have a tribute album. He's only 23 AND still alive!Spend your money wisely. Just buy Josh. It is well worth it!!
2,Some tracks are ok.,"There are a couple of tracks that didn't sound too bad. Like others, I only listened to the sound bites. I wouldn't waste my money on this. If the artists don't want their names put to the songs it can't say anything good about the CD. This tribute was made because someone wanted to make a quick buck. Josh Groban's name sells. The producer figured that people would buy just because of the name."
1,"This is NOT a tribute to Josh, it is a DISGRACE!",I cannot believe that this person believes this is a tribute to Josh Groban. The CD should be removed from Amazon. It is a disgrace to all that Josh Groban is. I honestly thought when I heard it that it was a joke. Maybe the Daily Show with John Stewart placed it on Amazon as a joke? IT IS HORRIBLE. How could someone do this??
1,gross! this doesnt even deserve one star,"i was thoroughly disgusted just to listen to the samples! why is there a ""tribute"" to josh groban? he isnt even 30 years old yet!!! this is no tribute but just a bunch of people trying to sound like him. i dont recommend it to anyone."
1,Oh my Josh! You should sue!,"I can't believe how HORRIBLE this is! People, PLEASE don't waste a cent on this one! Buy the real thing: JOSH. Nothing compares. You don't give honor to someone by trashing their songs with poor voices that are out of tune with no quality. There's only ONE Josh Groban, and he's the only one that should be singing these songs! I had to turn off my speakers this was so bad! I'm disgusted by this - I'm with the other reviewer - I hope Josh doesn't hear this! And they need a ""0"" stars or a negative stars, because this one doesn't even deserve one star!"
3,A lot of talented people,"A decent album. Of course, nowhere near Josh's originals but there's still a lot of talent here that deserves praise. I do believe there are a couple of singers in this album who, with the right support, could produce master pieces.Some have a totally different style that Josh, a lot more mainstream pop, but still talented.The production is also not as sleek but that'$ under$tandable.Don't let the grobanites tell you what to do. As if these people selling a few albums is going to affect Josh Groban's career. They should see it as a praise. Listen to the clips and make your own decision."
4,TRIBUTE,"Okay, m'dears. Though it is, certainly, peanuts compared to Josh's album, do consider the name.""A Tribute to Josh Groban""That means they've fallen in love with talent and music and decided to tribute it. Perfectly understandable.Anyone heard ""Josh Groban: a Pianostrings Tribute""? It, too, it an album that doesn't try to be Josh, it just says ""Hey, this guy's worth following in the footsteps of, although we do recognize we aren't him"". So give it a break.Not a bad album, all in all. Josh is, of course, better, but then... DUH. ;o) Don't bash it."
5,Not that bad:),"I think you people are so cruel to this person!!! He sounds good to me and God gives all people a great voice in their own way!!! It's a TRIBUTE to Josh...not suppose to be Josh. That's like trying to sing like Cher, Madonna, or Mariah........CHILL PEOPLE AND STOP BASHING HIM!!! He's human and could read these reviews...YOU GO BOY!!!Peace, Love, and God's Blessings,Todd[...] SEEK THE LIGHT:) It does a BODY, SOUL, and SPIRIT GOOD!!!"
5,Sounds like Josh Groban at the GREEK,Except this lousy singer isn't as NASAL as Josh Groban in the Greek album. It's good for a laugh and a wink. I wouldn't buy it but it's truly funnny.
1,Please pull this item!!!!,"You've got to be kidding me!!! If these people were trying to compliment Josh, they have failed. This is an insult not only to Josh but his fans as well. No one who would listen to the REAL thing would even appreciate this attempt! Please, Amazon, pull this item from your store. It would be a waste of money for anyone to purchase this. I couldn't even make it through the tracks!"
1,Just Horrible!!,"If I could have given this a zero I would have. This is so awful it is barely worth listening to the samples. How anyone could call this a tribute to Josh Groban is beyond me. I'm thrilled they like his music, but this isn't even close to the velvet sound of Josh Groban. Go buy Josh's albums and stay clear of this knock-off, which is nothing more than someone's effort to capitalize on his name.Amazon, why are you even selling this? Have you no taste?"
1,What!!!!!,"Ther's just one thing I have to say...HOW did this thing ever get onto amazon in the first place!!!? Listening to it only gives me a greater appreciation for the finer points of Josh Groban's voice. It quite hurt my ears to listen to it. But possitively speaking, I did have a really good laugh!"
1,A waste of plastic!,"If the makers of this CD manage to make one red cent from sales of it, then tomorrow I'm going to gather up half a dozen of my most talentless girl friends and record ""A Tribute to Charlotte Church""!"
1,Beyond Comprehension!!!,"It is beyond my comprehension, why this CD was allowed to be recorded. It sounds like (and probably is) the karaoke music I've heard before. Shame, shame, shame!! It's not the songs that made Josh outstanding, it's his voice. There is no substitute. If there is one good thing I could say about it is that it made me appreciate Josh even more....if that is possible. Stay with the ""real thing."""
1,"Why God, Why?",I didn't even buy it but I own both of Josh Groben's CDs and just listening to one clip was horrifing! Why buy a tribute to him when you can buy the real thing?
1,Awful,"I can't even begin to describe how absolutely terrible this ripoff is. I can't believe it is legal to put this garbage on the market, it is an insult to Josh Groban and all of us fans. AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS! BUY CLOSER, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!"
1,Stop the Madness,"If only I could rate this lower. I mean, this was just plain cruel to the human race, not just the ears and Josh Groban himself. I just couldn't stop laughing at the sound clips. Anyone who thinks they can do these songs better than Josh Groban had better have the pipes to prove it. This was terrible. It was like a flashback to the beginnings of an American Idol season. Everyone thinks they can sing and someone should weed these people out. I also agree with every other reviewer. Why a tribute CD already? He hasn't even been around for that long. I love his voice but it's because of the voice, not the songs. Why replace it. Do the fans a favor and have Josh do his own tribute CD. SAY NO TO IMITATIONS!"
1,Extremely bad!!!,"Just listen to the music files, I don't think I have to say anything more.....you'll understand what I mean!"
1,What were they thinking?!,"I heard some of the sample tracks and they're simply awful! The singers can't even hold a note! Please, just skip this CD and buy the real thing."
1,If Only I Could Rate Zero Stars,"This was awful! It sounded like William Hung sings Josh Groban. The vocals sounded shaky the entire time, like the singer was running out of breath, the instrumentals sounded like a Super Nintendo game, and the whole package is just BAD. When you've already got something awesome, why remake it so that it's crappy?"
1,Terrible!,"I just heard the samples, and if you didn't, and you're thinking about buying this album, you should listen them. After that you should buy the REAL Josh's album. Josh doesn't need a tribute made by another person (which sings pretty awfull), Josh is UNIQUE, no one can sing his songs like him!!"
1,Yuck,From one Grobanite to all the rest out there- this album is a disgrace. None of these artists can even begin to touch Josh Groban's music (most artists can't). The only chills going up my spine with this album are in disgust. I highly recommend buying one of Josh's real albums...Josh deserves a much better tribute then this!
1,What the heck is this guy thinking?,"He sounds like people I've seen who sing solos in church that shouldn't even be allowed to sing in the shower. He might sound good if he'd sing his own stuff, but sometimes, the song is better left to the rightful singer. It's like trying to sing like Celine Dion..that just aint happening!"
1,Hilarious,"I guess if you want to demonstrate WHY the world loves Josh Groban, you just listen to this crap. Maybe the songs that Groban sings are too musically challenging for regular mortals or more likely this guy is playing a joke on us. He's HORRIBLE. It's almost like a spoof or something you would find on SNL. This guy shouldn't give up his day job. He really sucks!If you want a good laugh, play these tracks. I'm sure you won't have to buy another mouse trap, because anything with sentience will run away from the sound of this garbage. Amazon definitely needs a 0 star category, if only for this CD."
1,INSULTING!,"Martha Butitta, (singtomejosh FoJG), St. Robert, MO There is NO OTHER VOICE THAT COMPARES TO JOSH GROBAN'S! Josh is an exceptional person, artist, performer, and musician; whose equal will NOT be seen any time in the next 50+ YEARS! This ""Tribute"" is more of an insult to the beautiful voice of Josh Groban than anything else! I agree, this MUST be some sort of joke, and one in VERY POOR TASTE! YUCK!! This got 1 star ONLY because my review wouldn't have been accepted, BUT this TRASH doesn't even deserve the one star!!!"
1,UGH!!!,"UGH!! This is so beyond terrible. I only listened to the samples, and they were awful. Why would someone pay $10.99 to torture themselves with horrid reditions of what could be wonderful songs with a talentless person singing them when they can spend 4 or 5 extra bucks to purchase a CD of the REAL Josh Groban, who sings wonderful songs and has a voice so beautiful that it brings tears to people's eyes? The contents of this cd are truly not worthy to be called music and it makes me cry to think that this horrible thing has Josh's name on the front of it. If you are expecting anything remotely good out of this item, you won't be getting it. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!! I REPEAT: DO NOT BUY THIS!!"
2,"It's so bad, its kind of good.......","This CD is SOOOOO BAAAD, and the funny thing is: I like it. I like it because when I have a bad day, I come home and yes, I own this CD, because someone thought it would be nice to give it to me since I like groban's music. Anyways, I come home after a bad day, pop in the ol' wanna-be Groban CD, and I laugh like never before. Maybe that was their intent....."
1,Worth more if you use the CD as a coaster,I completely agree with Cheryl H. Long -- this is a gross insult to Josh Groban. NO ONE can come close to Josh Groban's talent. It's so bad that it would be a monumental improvement if Sanjaya sang this record!
1,Horrible!,"This doesn't even deserve one star! 'Absolutely awful' are the words that come to mind when asked to describe this atrocity of a CD. Josh Groban is an amazing, outstanding singer with a deep & powerful gift, & this 'tribute' desecrates his God-given talent. UCK! Please, I beg of you, DO NOT waste your money on this terrible CD. Now please excuse me whilst I wash my ears out after hearing the criminally disgusting sounds of those attempting to imitate Josh Groban."
1,Tribute or mockary,"10 stars to the idea of honoring such an amazing artist but who the heck are these people and why are they so terrible? Oh yes because they are attempting to impersonate Josh. Hmm well songs like ""Rememeber when it rained"" and everything else he sings should be left to somone who knows how to sing. Someone named oh should we say Josh groban?This CD is just truely painfull to listen to"
1,Minus 5 to whoever did this,OMG...A Si Volvieras a Mi was the worst spanish pronunciation I ever heard in my life. What was he thinking? Minus 5.
1,Unethical,"I happen to be one of those die hard Grobanites, and I have to say, this is just revolting. First off, Josh Groban is just starting his career, and he's not dead yet, so why make a tribute when you can listen to the one and only, even live in concert!You just don't make a tribute cd when you know no one can even come come close to sounding like the original.Someone PLEASE take it off the market, it's absolutely horrible such a cd would ever be made!"
1,This is really bad!,"Please, if you're really a fan of Josh, do not buy this CD. This is not a tribute, its more like a disgrace. I don't know why did they even allow this CD to be recorded and released. This music is definitely nothing compare to the original."
1,Who's idea was THIS?,"Whoever came up with an idea for a ""tribute"" to Josh Groban must have some loose screws. I mean, he's not dead. And he's so unbelievably talented, this is more of an insult! They all sound like horrific country singers who recorded the songs in their basement! By the way...was the guy who sings Remember When It Rained listening to the same song as us?"
1,My Ears Are Bleeding!!,"This was Nasty! They call it a tribute . Whoh! To what ? Yuck!! Don't buy this piece of , well you get the picture. But if you want a good laugh, listen to the samples & get ready for your ears to bleed. Josh Groban sounds like no one else on earth. The best Tribute to Josh is to buy his albums, & leave the music making to the pros."
1,OMG this is a joke..........right???????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I was looking for information about Josh's new cd... and stumbled across this. Of course I had (why oh why) to listen to these clips. The first thing that went through my head....this is a joke. Someone thought it would be funny to get a bunch of people who can not carry a tune together, and make a joke out of Josh's music. That is the first thought that went through my head..the second, omg why did't they burn this thing. Unreal....totally unreal!"
1,My opinion (fact),"Thats the most appalling and gaustly thing I've ever heard!These people are to music what Christina Agulara is to wholesome morality. MY EARS ARE BLEEDING BECAUSE OF IT!!!!!!!!!!! To put it bluntly this is a piece of crap and I should say that just the 15 seconds of the songs made me laugh soooo hard I thought I was going to puke and die. I'm sorry Josh that you had to endure listening to this. I wish they had word ratings because this would certainly be a ""crap"".p.S I love Josh and his music soooooo much. This can't be even be called a Tribute. More like a crapute if you ask me."
1,A howling of a drunken wolf,"All Josh Groban fans will be ashamed about such a TRIBUTE to THE VOICE HIMSELF . This singer should search for a new job because after that cd noone will let him perform anymore without being forced to do . It's just not acceptable and my ears are still bleeding . Thank God you just can listen to short samples ! Whoever had the idea for a project like that should get arrested . There is no word that describes how much I feel offended as a Josh lover and I advice everyone : DON'T EVEN LISTEN TO THE MUSIC & NEVER THINK ABOUT BUYING THAT CD !For me it's the proof that really everybody - no matter how less talented he/she is - can produce a record in these days . Music buisness is so strange .NO,THANK YOU !"
2,just aight,this is a middle of the Road compilation&that is pretty sad when you consider all the great Talented Artists from the past who didn't have the chance to be represented on one of these Compilations&you get over half of these songs that almost put me to sleep.there a few decent cuts here&the rest that need to be put to rest.one thing is for sure I doubt many people would Burn a Disc of these Songs together at once.
1,Absolutely stupid and a waste of time!,If you call any of the junk on last nights grammy's music. . . . then you need a hearing aide. It was ridiculous and a waste of time. ABC should be ashamed of itself for airing such a stupid show.
3,2004 Grammy Nominees,A good collection of songs. It would be worth every cent of the money spent if lyrics is included. =)
2,Only a few good songs...,"The only good songs on this cd are: ""Crazy in Love"", ""Clocks"", ""Beautiful"", ""I'm With You"", and ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough""That's only 5 great songs out of 21, so I wouldn't waste my money. You can get the good songs on other cd's. Stacey's Mom was a cool novelty song but it gets old fast, and Heather Headley needs to stop trying to be an R&B diva. Very dissapointing year for the Grammys"
4,Gotta love it,"Sound quality was excellent, especially for recordings of this age, and packaging was interesting. Highly recommended. Song selection was also completely satisfactory"
4,pure lsd inspired,they really nailed this one.designed to trip you out and sometimes freak you out.the name says it all on this one.psy chill from way back and is still fairly un dated with sound choice.turn the volume up slightly more than usual to appreciate the sonic hallucination.
2,Not What was advertized,"The product as listed was FamilyTree Maker 2006 Deluxe, The product I received was Family Tree Legends and not what was listed. It was important that I get the program I thought I was going to receive. I ultimately had to reorder from someone else to obtain FamilyTree Maker 2006."
5,It's All Or It's Nothing,"After the embarassing ""Liquid Dreams"", a track which I both love and hate, scarily at the same time, the O-Town boys followed it up with a smash ballad ""All Or Nothing"". This single was limited, and was well packaged, containing some bite size dance edits, a live track, and the third single as a bonus track. While I probably would have enjoyed the full length mixes more, the edits do quite nicely, with HQ2 & Mike Rizzo both turning out juicy remixes of the ballad, and the former pulling double duty on a dance take of ""Liquid Dreams"". A big highlight is the shockingly good live version of the Jacob Underwood penned album track ""Take Me Under"". One of their catchiest songs in my opinion, I'm amazed a live version actually sounds as good as it does. The final track is actually the third single from the band, a midtempo track with a summertime vibe, ""We Fit Together"" is another great O-Town single. A great boy band release."
4,All Or Nothing,"I think that the album is great I love the song all or nothing,because it shows that not only girls want all or nothing."
4,All or Nothing,"O-Town is great. They are young and fresh. The songs they sing are pop, but it has a lot of base. They all seem to have strong vocals. The ""song all or nothing"" is unique."
5,Unforgettable characters and a gravity bong,"Chris Millis is a shining star. His tight novella was written in three days through the famous Canadian competition. It's a stellar read and the author's genius shines through with characters like Franklin Franklin, Burt Walnut and Mr. Allspice. Oh, and let's not forget the dead Mr. Olivetti. There's nothing like a corpse on the kitchen floor to kick off a super story."
3,it's exactly what it looks like.,"I bought this book for my husband for his continuing interest in learning to cook with me in the kitchen. It's a nice collection that are what we call ""manly man"" recipe's; full of meat, high in fat, and hearty portions. In that aspect it's exactly what i wanted.Now, the reason it only got a three star. I hoped this book would help teach my husband how to cook without me in the kitchen for the nights that i had to work late. And while the recipe's are simple, they don't help teach an idiot how to cook. I assumed they would spell things out, help explain and understand the terms and techniques used in the kitchen; unfortunately i end up cooking most of the recipe because it lacks information to help my husband do it himself.Overall, it's a nice cookbook for men who know how to cook, but it's no learners' guide and not the starter book i was looking for."
5,A good collection for those who aren't exactly cooking challenged,"I'm far from unexperienced in the kitchen, but the majority of my specality was limited to either breakfast type foods or what I could mix together in a crock pot.The recipies are laid out very easy to follow directions, usually with a story or anecdote to go with each.What really has me turning to this book again and again is the part of cooking that I hate, the clean up. The majority of the recipies can be cooked up with a very minimum of clean up after the meal is done.A definte buy for the guy who hates washing dishes, is tired of eating off paper plates, is sick of tv dinners and can't find the can opener."
2,A little too basic..,"Ok, I don't know anything about cooking and want to learn, so I picked up this book. It's well written and I appreciate the reminders to wash my hands, but really opening cans and mixing things together isn't exactly anything new. Guess this is for bigger idiot's than me."
4,Good Information about babies changing world,"I bought this book as a way to be prepared for the fussy periods my baby would be having throughout the course of her first year. It has been a good book in the sense that it tells you when the fussy periods will begin, what will happen and how to help in the transition process for your child. It has been pretty true to form for the most part as my baby is only 6 months old now. I like the fact that I can see that what she is doing is normal and that I shouldn't panic if her appetite isn't there or she's sleeping a little more. I like this book and would reccommend it to a friend. Actually, I bought this for a friend of mine who is expecting in August. I thought it was that good that I wanted to pass on the information."
5,Wish I'd had this book with my first baby...,"This is such a helpful book. It explains all of the major developmental stages, and helps you understand what your infant might be going through. It seemed whenever my son would start getting fussy or sleeping poorly, I'd look in this book and coordinate it with a different developmental milestone. I recommend this book to any new parents. Sometimes realizing what's happening, makes it easier to deal with."
2,for parents of fussy babies,"I had heard great things about this book. But it really isn't all that helpful. I think if I had a fussy child it might be more useful. Some of the parents quoted in the book seem a little neurotic to me. The ""weeks"" are hard to pin down... there's a big window, if your kid was born early or late it changes the counting, so basically, if your kid is fussy there's a good reason. I couldn't find it at the library so I bought a copy. I think I might just donate it to the local library."
5,Great Baby Guide!,"The premise of this book is that there are 8 ""leaps"" that your child makes in the first year of life. The book reveiws these leaps, by explaining what's going on during them, how they will affect baby's behavior and and what you should see in baby after the leap.So far, the leaps have been pretty accurate with my daughter. And I must say that having the information in the book has been both helpful and insightful. It has been nice to get a leg up on what to expect so that when the fussiness hits, I can be better prepared to deal with it.I definintely reccomend this book to any new parent."
2,good and bad,"This book has some good information on what to look for during growth spurts and developmental leaps however, I can not believe some of the comments they published in this book! It really upset me. One stated how the mother gave her baby a ""good shake"". New moms read this for advice! There is a box on the page that says ""shaking CAN be harmful"". Can??? Shaking IS ALWAYS harmful and NEVER ok. The very next page begins to describe how a mother admits to SLAP her baby not because she doesnt like him, but because she wants him to be happy and she feels alone! What a horrible message to give to mothers. I am not even finished reading this book not even halfway done, but I don't know if I want to now! Im afraid that someone will read this at their wit's end and think its ok to do these things."
2,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed by this book. After doing hours of research on the internet to find a book that would help me nourish my baby's intellect, this was the worst text I ended up purchasing. My main problem with the book is that it did not deliver on its claims."
5,Gipsy Kings Best,"OK, I like this group and their sound, so no surprise that I found it excellent. Bought to replace an older compilation I gave away years ago. As usual, there is always the question of what songs to put on and which ones to leave off. This is one of the best compilation of an artists' biggest hits that I've encountered. Most of the old and some of the new. The instrumentals songs were very strong, would like a few more of them and a couple less of others, but hey, that's life."
5,Truly the Very Best!,My husband bought me this CD for our wedding anniversary. We listen to it on our way back from San Diego....and truly every song is wonderful. Gypsy Kings are amazing!
5,gypsy kings are The Kings!,"Always a pleasure to listen to their music, always make you feel good. Guitar solos are fabulous. 2 disc set is very complete and good for start up or a customer familiar with the music."
5,The title says it all!,This set is a fantastic collection of all my favorite Gipsy Kings tunes. Highly recommended for fans both old and new!
5,As an animation art teacher I'll use this for my students.,"This book is the best place to start actually making animation. Equipment construction is explained well enough to start a professional studio. Techniques are clearly described and perfect for students of the art. Extras are the theory of what is funny and why, but mostly, the uses animation may serve in education. Many great old illustrations of walks pepper this volume. If you like to draw in ink, this book is for you."
4,"I never give 5 stars unless its perfect, but its darn good","People that gave this book low ratings probably wrote competiting books. Because there was mixed reviews, I didn't buy it online, instead I went to the store to see the whole thing. Within two minutes of looking at it, I was sold.I'm an newly appointed advertising sales manager who went to one trade show and saw I needed help. So I bought this book. That was just 4 hours ago, and I already have 4 pages of ideas that I know will help me make a lot more $$$$$$.I'm just writing this review so you don't get skeptical like I did. Its not filled with useless stuff to add pages. Its pretty good stuff that a relative newcomer to the game will find VERY useful. Hot Shots that know everything already and write bad reviews shouldn't be buying books like this anyway. right?"
4,A GOOD ALTERNATIVE,"I WAS USING THE WIRELESS RECIVER-TRANSMITTER TYPE AND HAD TO ABANDON IT DUE TO INTERFERENCE FROM OTHER GHz operating devices.Now I have good picture and sound on my remote TV set using this LF-10s. A good product if you have a phone line next to the setup. THere is a slight hiss (HF) picked up by my remote LCD TV (samsung 173MW).but then if the reviewer (see below) can run another phone wire, why can't he run a coax? hahaha,,"
3,Pretty Good,"This game wuz exciting to me at first. You get to choose a horse, take care of it, and then race with it. But after awhile the races get old. You can't do much except clean the horse. So if you're planning a short lasting exciting game for your child...this is the game for u!"
2,Not the bast buy,the game is not what u read at allgroom your own horse u bearly move the cursor past and the horse is brushed.u get 12 horses but only five can go in a show.the club room is boring.the competition isnt bad but the grafics are poor.this is not the best game to buy. But if u like horses alot ull be able to accept it
3,It looks better than you think,"This game was boring! I like the barbie horse game better! DON""T BUY IT1. All you do is watch the instructor talk in lesssons. They don't even tell you the right stuff. Do you pot by going back than foward? I don't think so!2. The only time you can controlll your horse is in the ... shows.3. The horses are mad ugly (well ponies because that is all they really have!)4. The graphics stink!"
1,Not the best buy,"there are so many better games out there then this one. the graphics arent good at all. You dont get to ride in your lesson you just watch videos. The barn has 12 horses but only 5 can go 2 the show. The dressage you have to memorize your test, the cross country is horrible because if you gallop, you cant steer. The show jumping is ok but you cant turn if you canter. There are better games out there."
1,Let's Ride,"Let's Ride looks fun,but thats only the outside. When I got this game I thought it would be really fun.Here are some bad things about this game.1.You can ride 12 horses but only 5 can be used in shows. 2.The lessons are soooooooooooo boring! All you do is listen to the instructor talk! You don't do anything! 3.You can't feed the horses not even treats. 5.The instructors treat you like a baby.Anyways this game is really bad. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!"
1,Blah...,"If you are going to get this game, then you are simply wasting your money. This game is soo boring. You can only pick through three horses to buy. There is an Arabian mare, an English gelding, and a Welsh Pony mare that is castrated. So even just out of the horses , the game is boring. When you go to tack up you ""horse"" they DAMAND you put on their "" Cherry Red Saddlepad and my Leather Bridle and Saddle"" Even a second after they eat they say "" Pee u! You better start cleanin' ""Missy""!"" They dont even respect you! The game doesn't even give you clear instrucktions on how to do the competisions. You hear me out ""WARNING!: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME BECUASE YOU MAY SUFFUR OF BORDISIOM!!!!!!!"""
1,Dont Judge a game by it's COVER!!,"Sure the game looks great and sounds great in the store but as soon as it's home and on the computer it's horrible!!!The horses look strange, you can't take a lesson all you do is watch a video and answer questions. Stadium Jumping is okay it's not life like at ALL. You can't do cross country for you are going to fast, the trail is narrow and you can't see anything. Dressage is even harder for you have to get it exactly right and you have to memorize the test wich takes the fun out of it, you might as well be on a real horse at a horse show then trying to remeber it on a game. I recomend Horse Illustrated, Champion Season. DONT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!"
1,Not worth it,"I bought the game about a year or so ago from my local tack shop. I should have spend the extra $[] to get 'Mary King's Riding Star'. 'Let's Ride' is basically written in the Queen's English and the British measurements and all. The graphics are actually quite good in the stable, but that's about it. The lessons are easy and long. The actual showing portion is disapointing. Of the 12 or so horses the stable has, you can only use, I think, 5 of them. Cross Country is just running in a circle jumping logs that you can't always see. Dressage is nearly impossible to get passed the halt at X. Only show jumping is intersting. However, you often can't control the speed of your horse (always having to keep the speed on or never being able to slow down), the turns are way too tight, and refusals can come out of nowhere.I recommed not buying this game. Go to a better game like 'Mary King's Riding Star', 'Farman Horse Racing', or any other game."
2,Really not worth the money,"Well, the game starts off real good. You get to groom your horse and pick which horse you will use in your riding lesson. but the only time you ever get to really ride the horse is when you are having your riding lesson (which is where you do hardly anything but listen to the instructor talk) and when you are in competitions. Besides that, you do NOTHING. i think the game is actually to TEACH YOU HOW TO RIDE AND MORE ABOUT HORSES than it is to have fun, comparing it to th Pippa Funnell games. you'll be wasting your time trying to get any fun out of it."
2,Not the best...,"This game, in my opinion, was much too frustrating. I've owned it for about three or four years, and I still have yet to actually beat dressage! The controls are difficult, and even the ""Advanced"" level is elementary stuff. The most fun I had was with the paper doll game. If you're going to purchase a game, I highly recommend either ""Saddle Up With Pippa Funnell"" or ""Equestriad 2001"""
3,FUN! If you never rode a horse in REAL LIFE!,"I am an itermidate rider and all this game does is try to teach you how to ride. Or at least thats what they try to acomplish. I learned nothing not even in the Advanced course. Grooming is a little fun. The eventing would be if the graphics were not prehistoric. The new Let's Ride! is 100% better! (Riding Star/Equestriad/Chamipionship Season) Hey if you want to but this game to learn 2 ride, spend your money on a REAL RIDING LESSON"
3,Was not really a takeover,"This CD was ok for me. Some of the tracks on the CD I thought sounded horrible. It was only 5 tracks that I enjoyed. The last track ""My Help"" I really liked; it had the tradional church sound to it. Overall if people are into gospel rap this CD is for you. I am not really into rap so I really did not enjoy this CD. O2 much better."
2,Not the same...,I ordered this disc to replace one I had purchased years ago during its original release back in the 90's. If you like James Taylor you'll like this CD. My problem with it is not the music but the fact that this is not the same CD as the original. The original had a feature called CD-Text which displays the song titles and other info on the display of the CD player. This CD does not have this feature. I did not get what I thought I paid for.
4,Franklin and the Bus Patrol,"The 5 stories are Franklin and the Bus Patrol, Franklin Loses a Book, Franklin's Jug Band, Franklin in Two Places, and Franklin the Teacher. One story is a repeat from an old VHS tape-Franklin's Reading Adventures."
4,damn fun,"well i can't pretend to be much of an expert on either brazilian or electronic music. and i don't understand portugese. but i am a big fan of what brazilian music i have heard... i started listening in the late eighties when david byrne released his collections and most recently found this tom ze album ""estudianta o pagode..."" which is fantastic. and i just had to have more, so i picked up this album and the rough guide to samba. and frankly i can't imagine anyone who has a taste for such things not enjoying these discs. this one in particular just makes me wanna dance... not perhaps a pretty sight but damn fun."
4,A Great Source for Beginners...,"...and a good refresher course for theater educators or others who use the arts in the classroom. The games are organized into 12 units with titles such as ""Trust"" and ""Reality,"" that guide your search for the right exercise, although I have found that randomly leafing through the pages proves equally as effective. The author places no age restrictions on the games, but most will work easily for students K-6, and many can be expanded or modified for older students. The quotations section in Unit 12 is especially inspirational and provocative. Schotz's style and attention to detail will reassure beginners."
4,fun,"these guys are a great time. perfect for a little pick me up, when you're feelin' pissy. so...during stormy weather, listen to dudes singing Tracy Chapman's ""For my lover"" & then have a ""Sammy Hagar Weekend"", 'cause you can't always drive 55...;>"
1,It's Good For One Thing...,This book is good for one thing only and that is its pictures of the Olympic and Titanic's staterooms. This rest is a muddle of information on the 3 sister ships that can't define the difference between the three.VERY BAD EDITING.
5,THE BEST FOR IMAGES!,This is the best book if you want images of staterooms. There is also a part with some of the original drawings of light fig. and rooms.
3,Not bad but expected better,"This was a nice book but wasn't like I was expecting. A lot of the photos weren't even of titanic and some of the ones that said they were, were in also not titanic. I was expecting a more technical stuff. I am not trashing the book just disappointes is all."
2,Ho-hum local PBS production.,I was extremely disappointed in this ill conceived and poorly executed production from the local PBS station in Indianapolis. It has too many interviews and too little natural scenery.
1,Did I get a different CD?,The instrumentals were nice on the CD. Loved the brief guitar and piano. Thats why I gave it a star. To try to be more objective I told myself to listen to the CD 5 times but I could only do 3. She sings oh my goodness take some voice lessons flat and whiny in places on every song. Some song choices were just plain odd. I took a chance based on reviews- does not pay to do that sometimes.
3,New talent on the horizon,"I was plesantly surprised when I first heard this CD. The more I listened to it the more it grew on me. My favorite song is ""In the Bag"". I have turned several friends on to Only Human.This younglady has alot of potential and can only get better with time. Thanks Changamire for some decent listening music."
5,The Sporting Spaniel Handbook,"Wow, this book was a Godsend! With my kids clamoring for a puppy and my total lack of knowledge about breeds, this book gave me much useful information leading towards our decision to go with a field spaniel with its laidback, easy-going nature. I found the breed comparison charts really helpful -- they brought up useful considerations I wouldn't have factored in ordinarily. My kids loved the many color pictures."
1,Buyer Beware!,"I feel ripped off. If you own Quuesnryche: Evolution, then you already own this DVD. These are the same songs and performances from that concert. They feature Mike Stone on the cover, and also list him on the back of the DVD as guitar and vocals, but it is the same concert that featured Kelly Gray back in 2001. Shame on BMG for releasing this DVD. I hope you're proud on raping me of my money."
5,Worth your time,"The authors write with credibility that comes from experience. Their church planting and coaching experience gives more weight to their advice than if this were a theoretical treatise. I really liked the style as well. Rather than attempting to write a text book, they give many short suggestions and considerations. Each one was developed just enough and not overdone. As a result I could easily digest the idea and go off to think about it for hours or days before going back for more. I don't think that everything they have done needs to be done the way they did it in every church planting situation, but as I said, due to their experience, all of it is very worthy of consideration.Any pastor or elder could profit from the ideas in the book, not just church planters."
2,"A Climax That Didn't, At Least Musically","I loved the trilogy overall. Reviews of ""At World's End"" were disappointing, but I thought it was a good movie that ended the series well. I really liked the first soundtrack, loved the second, but was disappointed with the third. Some of the segments were too soft to hear well, others were too disjointed. It seems like the score kept trying to rev up to an exciting and powerful climax, but fell short before achieving the effect that ""Hello Beastie"" pulled off in ""Dead Man's Chest"". ""Drink Up Me Hearties"" almost works, but not quite..."
3,At World's End soundtrack a little too much,"The music itself is scored heavily on the percussion, and most of the tracks are bombastic. The fault in this is the same with the movie: Too many climaxes, and not enough quieter places."
2,"Incomplete ""sound track""","I specifically purchased this ""sound track"" for the first song ""Hoist the Colours"", as I found it haunting enough to be included in a Halloween theme music mix CD.Imagine my dismay when I find it incomplete! In the movie, between the boy's solo and the pirates' chorus, a condemned black pirate, up on the gallows with the boy also sings a verse. That is missing from this supposed sound track.I am not pleased."
5,Molly Lake says...,"Molly LakeContinue to enjoy this album, tho' I believe the first movie's music can't be topped."
5,Movie Soundtrack Review,"I love his music. And all the movie soundtracks he has done. I already have two of these,one for my car,and one for my home. This purchase was for my best friend on her birthday. His music for soundtracks,always intenses and blends so well with the movie,which it is all about. He's a wonderful composer."
4,Beautifully Done!,"Hans Zimmer has done a magnificent job of blending the various themes from the last two soundtracks into some new ones created for this one. And the best difference between this one and the last two is that, with the exception of two tracks (""Up Is Down"" and ""I See Dead People In Boats"") it is chronologically arranged to coincide with the movie. My only wish is that they had included more than just a single verse/chorus of the pirate anthem ""Hoist The Colours"" being sung by the boy and chorus. That, and the new theme for Elizabeth and Will ""One Day"" are haunting and beautiful. And the ""Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"" echoes to be found in ""Parlay"" are very humorous, given the nature of that scene in the movie. (Something I hadn't originally noticed when I was so intent on following the storyline.) I'm finding the purchase well worth the investment."
4,Better than the movie,"The 'At World's End' is better than the movie it appeared in. There are some dramatic pieces in here that stand up with anything Hans Zimmer has ever written. I'm only giving it four stars because it builds on the themes and motifs written by Klaus Bedalt for the first movie, which, while not better than this soundtrack on a technical level, is a lot more fun."
5,Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End - CD,"After seeing the movie, we wanted the soundtrack because we thought the music score was great. Ordered the CD, received it in a timely manner and was pleased with the service."
5,The Best of the 3 Pirate Soundtracks,This is the best of all the Pirate soundtracks. The new love theme is absolutely gorgeous. I could listen to this one endlessly.
5,Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End - A must have soundtrack,"All the hype in recent weeks has been about the new summer blockbusters that are soon to be released, including the third installment of the Pirates trilogy. Not to the realization of many people, music plays an absolute vital part to the success of a movie. Hans Zimmer and his creative score for this movie will put At World's End above the other movies of the summer. From the emotional new love theme presented in ""At Wit's End"" to the more recognizingly pirate-ish ""Drink Up, Me Hearties"", this epic story told alone by Zimmer's music will have you listening to each track over and over. The full and powerful sound of the orchestra will suck you into the action and swashbuckling found in Verbinski's three unforgettable films. ARRRRR!!"
3,Decent,"I am a big Hans Zimmer fan but I didnt like this soundtrack very much. I really only bought it for the first track on the CD - Hoist the Colours. Its really short, only 1:31. I wish there were an extended edition available."
4,Great introduction to Byrd's vocal music,"There is much to like about this disc. The choir sings an interesting variety of Byrd's vocal works, and the singing is at a high level with excellent pitch control (not easy in many of these pieces) and great balance across the parts. There are several pieces (eg Plorans Plorabit) that are exceptionally well defined, whereas others come across as slightly one dimensional. Overall however a very worthwhile addition."
3,Too kinked up..,The chain had 3 kinks in it that I just could not get out for fear of damaging or breaking the links. I returned it and received a fairly prompt refund.
2,thought it would be bigger,tarnished quickly and clasp broke within first week. way to thin connections.wish it would have stayed toghether.hope for a discount on a thicker chain?
1,not good at all,i have watched a few movies about ted bundy that were pretty well fact based. however this movie.......i don't even think i watched 5 minutes of it. it was that bad
2,Uh...Mark Twain Enjoy This...I Don't Think So,"In the tradition of Tom Robbins and Richard Brautigan (with a dollop of magic realism), Jack Cady has written a book filled with word play, non-sequiturs, buildings that move themselves at will, a cat that speaks nearly all world languages and none of that can disguise the fact that this is an overstuffed God vs. the Devil, with mankind as a faithless witness, story as old and overworked as the hills. As usual in such stories, the most interesting character is the Devil and he's the least developed. Not worth your time."
2,"writing - not bad, but who cares?","I really wanted to like this book. Really. I read some reviews, and it seemed to be just perfect. A horror story with humor, written in Mark Twain's style. Well, the writing is O'K. I have no clue if Twain would have liked the book, perhaps... I know I did not. Although written in lively language, and with sparks of humor now and then, it just tries too hard to be off-beat. Most of the ideas are simply uninteresting (cat purring in different languages). It somehow feels like recycled material sprinkled with a few jokes here and there. But the worst part was that I just did not care at all about the plot. Even if the book was mildly amusing, I could not force myself to keep on reading - I really did not care what happens next, and the book was not good enough to read on just for the pleasure of reading."
5,Beginning Birder,"Really a good set of binoculars! I got the pair for my wife who had trouble using a pair of more expensive binoculars, she immediately was more satisfied with these than the ones costing two and a half times what these did. Great wide strap makes you feel like there is nothing on your neck!! I am looking at Celestron's spotting scopes since these are so good."
4,Satisfied so far,"After studying various reviews, I selected this item for its cost/quality ratio. It is reported to have very good optics and an excellent guarantee. It has a very close focus, and it is the first binocular that I have been able to use with my glasses. I have not done much distance viewing at this point, but I will this summer on a trip to Alaska. I have no reason to believe I won't be well satisfied."
5,I love this lens for the price!,"I just purchased my Tamron 88-210mm F/4.5-5.6 lens and I am already in LOVE with it! I travel a lot and wanted something that would zoom and still capture natural pictures. For the price this lens is a steal! If you are wanting a cheap lens that does a FANTASTIC job, I would definitely suggest this one!"
3,"Engrossing, but ultimately unsatisfying","This book definitely kept my attention until the very end, but when it was over I was left with many unanswered questions. The author does not spend any time at all delving into the problems that got the teens into the Unit in the first place. I kept waiting for her to get more in depth with the characters, but it never happened. Having said that, the plot was very interesting and I couldn't put the book down."
3,Intriguing,"The Reunion is unpredictable and intriguing. The plot, which jumps back and forth in time, is quite complex. The writing is gripping and easy to read, the characters engaging and realistic. This book will have you thinking long after you are finished reading."
3,Complex and confusing,"The debut novel by journalist Sue Walker is convoluted and gritty story about disturbed misfits. Twenty six years after release from the mental hospital, former patients are misteriously dying.Ms. Walker uses many times seen, uneasy mix of past and present. It is hard to qualify this book as mystery, it is more a fiction about crimes commited.""The Reunion"" is a well written novel, but with beginners mistakes. The constant leaping from past to present and the other way around, adds to the confusion. Even if we hear a lot of details about characters, they are still strangers to us. Maybe because they seem quite artificial and plastic. Interesting but flawed book."
2,UNNECESSARY VIOLENCE,"Not only does the "" secret"" sicken one's stomach, the novel its self is so lacking in originality it became boring for me to keep reading. I do not want to be unkind. I know this is Sue Walker's first novel; she is young and has room to grow. She said she wrote about things she witnessed. If so; she sure could take some lessons from excellent novelists such as Patricia Cornwell, John Grisham and even Ed McBain who write about what they know perhaps she would learn how to expressess herself without banal attempts at trying to be clever by winding and weaving suspision from one charachter to another through out each chapter. So unoriginal."
4,Easy to use,"I have used Clean & Easy for several years. These rollers are very easy to use and the wax rolls on very smoothly. One thing I don't like about them is that they are very difficult to clean. In fact, I have to throw them away after each waxing session because it is nearly impossible to get the wax off. So you have to buy about 3 of these for each bottle of wax."
3,VERY hard to clean!,"I really like the way this roller works once the wax is fully heated. It rolls on perfectly if the wax is at the right temperature. The problem comes at clean up time. It's very difficult to clean. I tried the Clean & Easy wax remover, which works great on the skin but not on the roller, I tried boiling it out, and even tried removing the roller part to clean it out (I felt like I was going to break it though). I agree with one of the other reviewers that they should make the roller detachable. If not, at least advertise them as a one time use. I'm a little bummed about this because I really like this method of waxing better. I ended up just ordering the tub wax and warmer instead of getting another set of wax refills. I really like this brand of wax and wax products so I will continue to use them."
4,great reference book for you boat people,"this book is a bio-dictionary (as the title suggests) of u-boat commanders. it lists the names from A TO Z. in this book are-1,411 commanders (no ,i am not making this up!) each entry contains:dates of birth,place of birth,""class of"",officer/uboat training(where/when),cdr of(uboat#),sea going appointments (plus dates),decorations,captivity (plus dates) or lost at sea (date).the middle of the book contains 96 black and white photos of various commanders. the index in back of book,contains ALL uboats from ""U1' to ""4719"" and it's commander(s). what the book DOES NOT contain is,POST WAR dates of death. this info must be found somewhere else.i have only given it four stars because,it seems quite an expensive book and the authors could have at least, tried to have a photo for EACH commander although,i am sure it would have been a monumental task to have found photographs of them all."
3,Being Jewish would probably help,"Being Jewish may help readers connect with Zimmer, the protagonist grappling with a crisis of faith and identity as a man born Jewish but living as he was raised, with no attachment to the Jewish culture or history. Nonetheless, I found Zimmer's personal struggle on this subject to be quite interesting, if not emotionally engaging. I became much more invested in the outcome of the story when the novel shifted emphasis toward the end to focus on Zimmer's conflict between his emotional gratification and his role as a husband and father. At this point, with a much more ""human"" Zimmer, I was reminded of Girls and Closing Arguments, two other Busch novels I highly recommend.I found the dialog, at times, difficult to follow and too stilted for my taste. Also, the seamless shifts in time I enjoyed so much in Closing Arguments and The Night Inspector (another Busch novel) were, perhaps, too invisibly mended in this story."
4,Excellent,"Columbia staff producer Al Kooper worked on Don Ellis' Autamn in 1969.This is very good and very varied, showing Ellis' endless experimentalism: first is the gorgeous ""Variations For Trumpet,"" a jazz piece that has all the sweep and grandeur of the best 1970's progressive rock, the grace of classical music, and the invention of the most experimental jazz. As free jazz ruled and fusion was coming to pass, Ellis made his innovations by the massive scope of his compositions.""Piggle Wiggle Stomp"" is be-bop changes with a big band: huge, riotous and raucous enough for any rock concert of the time. The same describes the live take of ""Indian Lady,"" from Ellis'Electric Bath.Advanced symphonic structures, an echoing wha wha trumpet, the mix of jazz tradition and rock power--1960's Ellis oozes innovations. You've got to hear all of it if this sounds attractive, Autumn included."
3,The keys come off very easily but the pentatonic notes are lovely,"It's already driving me insane having to repeatedly put the keys back on for my little ones. And the toy is rather lightweight. But the notes are clear and lovely and I am pleased to finally find something pentatonic and toddler (relatively anyway) friendly. So, yeah, a 3 star toy."
2,Only 2 of 3 discs work.,"The pretend disc didn't work. We had ordered two sets by error and were going to just give the one away. When we checked the second set the same disc didn't work.Other than that, the other two were great, our 3 yr old and his older brothers (they won't admit it) all enjoyed the videos and the bonus features."
1,Let's Pretend Disc is not working,"I regret getting this DVD set barney playdate. I should have read the review. The Let's pretend disc is not working at all, there's no image, no sound, basically only two discs, I hope amazon will do something about this, to make sure the disc work in the future, otherwise no point buying this set! Disappointment!!!"
5,An Analysis of the Keynesian Fallacies,"Henry Hazlitt, ""Now though I have analyzed Keynes's General Theory in the following pages theorem by theorem, chapter by chapter, and sometimes even sentence by sentence ... I have been unable to find in it a single important doctrine that is both true and original. What is original in the book is not true; and what is true is not original."""
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!,"I was drawn to this dog house by its look, the fact that the floor was raised off the ground and it was simply big enough for my 110 lbs rottweiler. Shortly after it arrived and was assembled, the floor BROKE! The walls now wobble without the added support from the floor. I am very VERY disappointed. I would have thought they would engineer it to support the weight of a dog that requires this size of house. Don't throw your money away."
2,Not much house for the money.,Very light weight materials. Not water/weather proof (isn't that what a dog house is supposed to be?). Don't think it will last a year.
2,Nice looking but very cheap materials,"I was excited to get this and loved the way it looked however it is made of very thin materials. The walls were like wafer board. Couldn't have been over 1/4"" thick if that much. For the cost, I would have expected better quality. And with it being as thin as it was, my dog had the whole front chewed off in less than a week. :( So, I am looking for a way to salvage this one or in the market for another dog house. Probably better if I get the plans and materials and make myself."
5,My pygmy goats love their new house!,"I actually bought this dog house for my two pygmy goats for some shelter from the cold, wind, and rain. They love it and it keeps them warm!"
1,Petco,"I will never order from this company again. Ordered mid December, estimated delivery date mid January. No problem there. Then i inquire the last day it was supposed to be delivered and they send back that it's back ordered and won't be here until mid march. AND, i get a notice that the price has gone up. What a crock.....canceled my order....."
1,Do not waste your money!!,"The only positives on this house is that it is very easy to put together, about ten minutes and that it looks nice, other than that there is no positive thing to say. Very cheap thin flimsy wood. Just put it together and I'm pretty sure the floor will be broken in the morning. Again a waste of money please do not buy"
4,Very good SUGAR FREE syrup!,"Despite the negative reviews, I tried the syrup anyway. I was quite pleased with it. I guess when you are expecting a burnt tootsie roll/listerine flavor, you get a pleasant surprise when it's pallatable. I really think the negative remarks were way off base. If you buy any sugar free syrup and expect it to taste like the original, your expectations are too high. All the Davinici sugar free syrups are good. Some taste a little too similar to the others to bother with. I have narrowed down my favorites as:1. White Chocolate2. Almond3. Carmel4. French VanillaIf you are looking to make a mocha, my suggestions is to do half Davinci Sugar Free Sauce and half Davinci Sugar Free Syrup. It makes a great sweet chocolatey mocha.I'd also like to add that Davinci Sugar Free syrups are superior to Torani Sugar Free. They are much more flavorful and require less syrup to achieve the desired taste.Good luck, and don't give up on this chocolate syrup."
4,Plastic under pants?,"I was a little skeptical about ordering underwear that's made up plastic....basically the same paper-like material used for heavy-duty envelopes, house wrap, etc. But they were comfortable and worked as advertised. Good value. If comfort is at a premium, I'd recommend cotton disposables instead."
5,Scarce for a reason.......it's great,"Undoubtedly some of the author's finest work, this is a book worth coveting but beware the hidden costs. The first casualty may be our televisions and not the least may be any smugness and/or complacency we have in our society and humanity.The stories are themselves superb, the author's notes excellent, the result is a book which once gotten is unlikely to ever leave your possession. Beyond getting the book, the next best piece of advice would be to skip ahead and read 'The New York Review of Bird' first"
2,Just OK,"My 3 sons (6, 3 and 2) all LOVE the LeapPad, and so do I. It is great fun, wonderfully educational, and ever-changing. This book, however, is not my favorite. Although my sons seem to enjoy it (at least the one who is then holding the pen does), for the spectators just listening along, it is pretty boring, as each page in appearance is not much different from the one before."
5,children's outdoor crafts,"This is an older book from the sixties full of great outdoor and exploring craft ideas. The pictures are old fashioned, but the ideas are great fun. The book arrived in great time and in great shape."
3,"Great ghost towns, old book","This book has many great sites in it, but there is one big problem with it. It is not so relevent today. Originally published in 1961, it does have great pictures of now (1961) and then (early 1900's). As you can see, the pictures that are listed as now, were taken over 45 years ago. But there is many good descriptions and stories in the book. And most of the great Colorado ghost towns today are listed in this book. I am an avid ghost town explorer and have had this book for a long while. I purchased it when I didn't know any better. As always, the best ghost town books (with the most up to date & pertinent info.) are whitten by Phillip Varney. He has great books for Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico. It's probably more worth it to put your money into his books. Even if you never go explore them, his books have great pictures and stories in them."
3,"BERGMAN, OPUS 8","*** 1950. Written and directed by Ingmar Bergman. Eighth movie of the Swedish master. Two musicians meet, marry, argue and finally bury the hatchet. Between melodrama and pure drama, it's still Bergman. Nearly half of the film takes place in the middle of Victor-Wild Strawberries - Criterion Collection-Sjöström's symphony orchestra. Bergman films with sensitiveness every section of the orchestra while it's playing Mozart, Mendelssohn, Smetana and Beethoven. You can find another DVD edition of this film in the Criterion box setEclipse Series 1 - Early Bergman (Torment / Crisis / Port of Call / Thirst / To Joy) (Criterion Collection)."
4,Bergman's Sharp Eye,"captures the deep thoughts and feelings beyond surface appearances in ways that few films ever had in 1950. Even as a very young director, he seems intimately aware of the creative personality type who recognizes and craves greatness, but is not quite able to attain it. The old orchestra conductor has found a way to channel this frustration into a work ethic. The young violinist at the center of this story is not quite so wise. The urgent music often parallels the inner struggle onscreen."
2,To Joy,This film is melodramatic and shallow even though Bergman seems to try hard to make it a serious work. Its characters' immature emotions border nave and adolescent. It feels like a typical Hollywood-style production of the late 40's-early 50's.
2,A disappointment after using French the Easy Way,"I often find myself learning or brushing up on the languages I use on business trips. I found that the French book in this series provided an enjoyable way to improve my French while sitting in airports or on airplanes. So when I needed to brush up my German, I bought the German book. Too bad. It lacks the interesting dialogs and gentle humor of the French book. Worse yet, it is set in a small type, hard to read under poor lights, and unlike the French book, leaves no place to write in the answers to the many exercises. Barrons should do a better job of editing this series for consistent quality."
3,Needs suggestions,"I enjoyed reading this book as I could take comfort in knowing that I was not the only one out there having trouble sharing a bed with someone. And I was able to show my spouse that I wasn't just complaining needlessly. Unfortunately, the book was not as helpful as I had hoped because it didn't offer many suggestions on how to actually get some sleep."
3,Interesting observation on couple sleep,"The author interviewed 40+ couples and presented us an interestinglook at couple sleep. The most fascinating thing from thissociological study is the role ""sleep"" plays in couple relationship.Sleep, traditionally regarded as simply rest, has become vital part inbuilding intimate relationship. Sleep together provides a privateplatform for a couple to communicate, share, and plan together.Although these are not some exciting insights, researchers insociology and psychology may borrow these results for the problemsthey study."
3,An Educational Material,"I purchased a barely used copy which has hi-lites and notes in one essay, ""Subversions of Domesticity."" This essay is about a character in ""Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl."" Possibly the only essay in the book the instructor assigned; I read this essay first. After reading four essays, I agree it is not entertaining. If you have not read the book/title an essay is probing, you may be curious to do so because it is like someone telling you what the story is about. If you have read them, you may delve into the essay better."
3,Good but not bedtime story,"One of the author/editors is a personal acquaintance, and that's how I heard of the book. It has a lot of good information but is not really the entertaining book I was looking for. I'm more surprised than displeased. I am interested in writings about women in the South and about women authors. For study, it's great."
3,it ok,it was ok. almond chocolate was same as i could get in my retail store. they weren't good as real milk chocolate almonds.
4,Tamron 20-40mm F/2.7-3.5-Nikon,"This Tamron is a very well made, sharp above F4, a little heavy compared to today's zooms, but the results are great. I shoot a lot of cars, and the distortion is controlled very well. The only real negative that I have found so far is the lens has a lot of flare. You really should use the lens shade on this one. The one I received is the re designed version of the one pictured. I wish they would get the picture right. I really wanted the version pictured. For an older lens, it works very well with the digital camera's. I have tried it on the D70 and the D90 with no problems. Highly recommended."
5,INSPIRING,"It will make your heart cry out for more of god. this bookremindsl us of how caring our heavenly father is, and how much hewants to be a part of our lives. a ""must read""!! It will change your life!! you won't be able to put it down!!"
5,A five star book,David Sears expertly blends personal experiences of sailors in the Battle of Leyte Gulf with historical facts to bring to the reader a clear picture of events surrounding that combat action. It's the personal accounts interwoven into the clash of forces which make this book an exciting read. The reader is made to feel the danger and excitement which provide an understanding of the sacrifices made by those young men. One example is the incident during the battle when the PT boats are deployed against Japanese warships. Two crewmen were operating a 20 mm gun near the boat's stern when a Japanese 3 inch shell passed between them. One can only imagine their feelings. I highly recommend this book.
2,"William Daughtrey, Richmond, Virginia","The book fails to engage the reader in the events of the battle and does not provide significant insight into the strategy of the battle or the context within which it was fought. For example, where was Nimitz, why was he pulled away, what was MacAtrhur doing at this time, etc. In comparing this book to William Manchester's ""Out of Darkness"" it is apparent that David Sears has neither the breadth of vocublary or the command of the English language to cobble together one of those ""can not put it down"" books for which ""Out of Darkness"" qualifies."
1,Worst Book Ever,"Mr. Walker wrote this book in a voice of being scared to publish anything controversal about Bon. People who say that it was wrong that the Young brothers didnt give an interview to honor Bon have their head up their arse. Back in Black was their way to honor Bon, not give a stupid interview 15-20years after hes been dead"
1,A Poor Biography,"Bon Scott is one of my heroes, and this book is a poor biography of his life. Although Bon's parents were involved in the book, the lack of other good sources is surprising and disappointing, and as a result this book is unsatisfying.I guess we have to wait until the Young brothers write their book!"
2,A bit disappointing,"Unless the result is ""Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs,"" I'm really not interested in an artist's personal life. But if you like plodding through dozens of interviews with ex-girlfriends, you'll find this fascinating. If you're interested in Scott's professional career, or song writing process, particularly the last episode, you are going to be very disappointed, since certain principals ""refused to be interviewed"" for this biography, whatever that means. Since the author could not obtain permission to reprint lyrics either, for whatever reason, that is missing as well. Perhaps someone who hasn't antagonized the people we really want to hear from should have written this book."
3,GOOD READING,"The great shame in this book is the fact that the Young brothers refused to give interviews for it, the same happening with drummer Phil Rudd. THey lost the opportuniy to help pay the definitive tribute to Bon, the true and only real singer of AC/DC. (Brian Johnson did a fine job until he blew his voice in the beginningof the nineties, I guess). Anyway, the book praises the sheer determination of the Young brothers, but also their roughness and coldness towards friends that doe'nt serve the band anymore."
2,This book is not what I thought it would be from the title.,"By the title of this book, I expected an informative book about bodybuilding nutrition. I was disappointed to find out that out of over 200 pages, one was devoted to nutrition and this was simply a plug for Met-Rx products. This entire book, and I mean all of it, is about every way imaginable to do your workouts differently - set schemes, sequencing, etc. If you want a book describing in detail all the techniques for working out that you've already heard about for fifteen years, buy this book. Don't buy it if you want a nutrition summary. One page about Met-Rx is all you will get."
1,don't waste your money,"I bought this book hoping to get some new information on how to be a non-steroid taking natural body-builder, yet the photos of everyone in the book are all of steroid monsters, and the routines propounded in the book are all the same old stupid techniques of high reps and multiple sets with super heavy weights to develop the ultimate muscle mass, without any concern for what these techniques do in the long run in terms of trashing all of your joints, or even that these are not the most effective techniques of weight training for symmetrical muscular development."
5,Best Pens,"These are really the best pens! They come in a variety of colors, and they do NOT dry out too quickly. I've found they're pretty expensive at an office supply store, but buying them on Amazon is a great snag!Great for colorcoding flashcards or notes!"
5,Hill writes a romantic novel that Predicted theACTUAL future,"This was the 4th book in the Americana Series, and I loved each and every one of them. But the thing that got me the most, that was one year before Hurricane Katrina destroyed New Orleans and the Louisiana/Mississippi Coastlines, she was writing about problems the Levees and environmental concerns would do to that area.This book gave me not only enjoyment, but a real look into why New Orleans was flooded. It wasn't that the Levees were too short, but that they were at all.I recommend this book highly, for the continuing romance of the LaDeux family, and a wonderful look into real environmental problems. I only wish she'd write a post-Katrina family book."
4,Hot! Gar-an-teed!!!!!!!,"I am a HUGE fan of Sandra Hill's Cajun Series and the long awaited Rene's story did not disappoint. Though the romance and story is not as great as Tall, Dark, and Cajun or The Love Portion, it still satisfies. Ms. Hill says this will be her last Cajun adventure (for now) and I am looking forward to Tee-John's tale (if she chooses to write one). This book has great humor, sizzling sex scenes, and pretty much on the button with the Cajun atomsphere (I should know, I live in South Louisiana)."
2,I stopped around...,"page 100. The plot just did hold me enough to want to go on. It seems too predictable. Maybe I am also overdosing on the virginal (or ""semi-virginal"" in this case) females and the full-throttle testosterone males solving this dilemna. This was my first Sandra Hill book."
2,Mediocre,"There was once a time where the brand ALVIN meant you were getting a good product.This is a very lightly constructed lamp. Since I work with the same materials it's built from I can easily reinforce it where it's weak. For the average buyer however, I'd suggest looking elsewhere.The arms are light gauge square steel tube and are not very sturdy.The lens, while is it indeed glass it is meager at best, with strong chromatic aberration when viewing through the lens at anything but 20 to center.The springs are very weak.The lamp head is injection modeled ABS and it is not very well gusseted. There is a great deal of flex.As of 1-2-2013 I've had the lamp nearly four months and made five modifications; the head housing of the lamp, and the friction binding for the head itself, head shade, the mount post and surface mount.All in all, it's worth exactly what it costs, and no more.If you want something that will last for years, this is NOT the one to buy."
1,Swing arm lamp suck,No matter how hard you try. You cant seem to tighten the screw to hold the lamp up. Other wise it would be okay.
3,Get what you pay for!,This lamp is functional but cheaply made. Table mounting bracket is not very secure. Lamp adjustments screw is very small and must be tightened extremely hard to stop the lamp from drooping. At the end of the day it is functional but just barely.
4,alvin magnifier swing arm lamp,the lamp is easy to use and swings out if the way when not needed . the light is also handy to give extra when needed.
1,Great magnifier - terrible product for its purpose,"The lens and light work very well together & can be positioned to conveniently read or work on a project. However, the clamp for attaching the lamp is worthless and the arm is not nearly as ""positionable"" as you would expect it to be. Move it & it comes off whatever it's attached to, which makes the thing essentially worthless despite the good lens & light. Don't bother with this product. There is a reason that it costs less than $16."
2,Arrived Broken,Arrived Broken. I had to rig the springs on the side using plastic wire ties. Build quality is poor. Don't expect it to last long.
2,Springs far too weak when new,"Aside from the clumsy way you have to finish assembly, I really object to the fact that even brand new the springs were far too weak to hold up the head. Unless it was set all the way at the maximum angle, it sagged down to its minimum angle. This is really inexcusable."
1,AWESOME for the first 12 months,"I LOVED this product for the first twelve months and would have given it five stars during this time. However, it quit working for me. Super frustrating, considering the price paid."
2,Great while it worked....,"I really, really loved this system. I am no audiophile, but it sounded great to me. It just stopped working shortly after one year. At first, it continued to work but only with the speakers on the base charger. Then it stopped working altogether. If it had lasted, I would have given it five stars. I just don't think it is worth it for one year of functioning."
5,best ipod/iphone solution,"I've had this system for about 2 months now, and it is awesome! The radio freq remote speakers and remote allow placement anywhere in your home or outside... incredible sound as well... you'll love it!"
3,When it works...it's great!,"Good sound quality, easy to use, long speaker life before recharge docking is needed.Cons - remote control is really flimsy, and breaks almost instantly. Speakers indicate they need to recharge when they really don't (red lights on them say on even when fully charged).If they can fix these two issues, these things would be perfect."
4,"good speakers, need bass for real party but definite ""wow"" factor with wireless","Good wireless speakers, haven't checked range on them outside of 50 feet but work well in that range. Liked them so much I bought 2 add on speakers. Need BASE for party though."
5,Incredibly versatile iPod sound system,"This is by far the best and most versatile iPod sound system out of the many I have purchased. Let's start with it's looks first. It is sleek and modern in appearance with small removable cube speakers that are unobtrusive in any environment. You simply insert the iPod in the dock and move the two removable speakers anywhere within 150 feet of the base. The included remote will control your iPod and uses radiofrequency so you don't have to be in line of sight with the base unit. This means you can get rid of your outdoor speakers (unless there are birds nesting in them) and bring these babies outside along with your remote! Sound quality is excellent and fully charged speakers will supposedly work for 10 hours before needing to be returned to the charging base. Definitely worth the money for quality, looks, and versatility."
2,Excellent Product... while it lasts.,"This was a great product, and I enjoyed it very much. Unfortunately I only enjoyed it for under a year when it simply stopped working.If it had lasted I would given it 5 stars in a heart beat. Great while it lasted."
5,Great product at a great price,"I was unsure at first about purchasing this product, it was so much cheeper than I was able to find it anywhere else. The product box was cut, obviously from when it was taken taken out of the shipping container, but other than it it was perfect. Not only that, it sounds great!"
3,Great Sound - questionable quality....,"This is a great set up and easy to use. Best quality sound for the money. However, over time the speakers don't hold their charge. One speaker dies after an hour and the other after 2 hours. Still a great product, just a little frustrating."
1,Bought it an never got it.,Bought it paid for it an never got it. Don't know why. Maybe it will come soon. So I can't say nothing good or bad about it
4,"Work great, price a little high.","I bought these to use in my Bradley smoker I received as a Xmas gift last year. I love the smoker, I love these wood pucks, but I hate to have to pay this much for some smoke. It's the only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 stars. I guess I have to get used to it, because I plan on doing alot more ""smokin""."
3,Pricey,"These are certainly good smoke wood pucks, but in my opinion, but Bradley has them over priced and evidently has the market for them locked up tight. I have found no generics of the same size."
5,smoking bisquits,I just smoked baby back ribs and I used either hickory or oak and then I finished it off with maple. Due to the cold weather here in North Cal. I smoked the ribs for about 8hrs. They came out great and everyone at work where I brought my finished ribs at raved about them!
5,Bradley 5 Flavor Varity 60 pack,Perfect choice for first time using the Bradley smoker. Briquetts are the perfect nail to the Bradley smokin hammer:)
3,It worked,"Aside from the package being opened prior to receiving the product and the box being written in a foreign language, I can't complain. Its a fun product for those days when you want a little variety."
4,Bradley 5 Flavor Variety Bisquettes 60 Pack,"A nice selection of flavors, It gives me the opportunity to try the different ones to see which I prefer. After being just a hickory smoker for so many years. I'm buying (stocking up) now. Only problem is you can't buy these at the corner store if you run out."
5,wook puck,"this varity pack is good for just getting started in the smoked foods, each flavor is about 4hour of smoke each."
3,Bradley Bisquettes,The bisquettes smoked the meat very nice. Only problem i have with them is they don't burn more than half way before they get chucked into the water bowl. Seems like a waste to me.
5,Doin Jimmy,"This is a great book! I couldn't put it down! It is a fun, witty, exciting, well-written journey through Hoffa's Detroit, the intrigue of the Detroit Mafia, a look at the posh suburb of Grosse Pointe and the beautiful northern Michigan area of Leelanau County. The characters and dialogue flow easily throughout, while the plot twists catch you off guard! The author has a wonderful sense of humor, as well. Fresh and unique! Highly recommended."
3,Claudia must make hard decisions that will change her life.,"Claudia is just getting used to the 7th grade. She is the queen, has a steady boyfriend Mark, and has some great friends. Then her life is turned upside down when she is offered the chance to go back to the 8th grade, and her boyfriend is acting weird. What is she going to decide to do?"
3,Mixed feelings,"This could've been a good book if Ann had developed the plot a little more. Since they all have the same basic up and down, climax system, it wasn't as interesting as being in the situation is. As a former BSC reader, I will say that this one was one of the better ones."
4,This book was okay.,"This wasn't my favorite BSC book. It wasn't the worst, but definitely not the best. I like that Claudia goes back to the eighth grade, but it's sort of unrealistic. I mean, she gets pulled back to 7th, then in a couple of books, she's back in 8th? Real schools don't do that. But anyway, I liked the Color War and I liked how the BSC made a color war for the kids."
1,what the hell?,"instead of putting her back a grade, why not hire a tutor for her or put her in special education instead of moving her back one grade and then back up? What a mess the education system would be if kids having trouble in school were moved back one year and then back to their normal year!"
4,Very good zoom lens for everyday photography,"I decided to give this lens a try after reading Wayne Kuban's review. I wasn't disappointed. Very sharp lens, with true colors and fast focusing. The zoom ring (after several months of continuous use) is becoming more fluid. Auto and manual focusing are both spot on. The only gripe is the hood - the hood is just not adequate for bright sun / open water photography (i.e. lots of reflections). I had to either shield the lens with my hand or shoot 180 to the sun (UV filter didn't help), or shoot lower than the horizon. Other than that this lens is a keeper."
5,Perfect,"This lens is exactly what I was looking for. It is compact an has a great range. It's a little heavy, but on my D700, it balances out. I would recommend this lens to anyone."
2,"I love Stryper, but don't like sappy ballads.","I had the 12 inch single for years, and got the cassette single just for the sake of collecting. This song was something I would have fast forwarded when I was a kid, to get to the heavy songs."
5,"Excellent book, wish I had a copy 15 years ago.","Paul's book was not written for those lacking experience in the areas of both electronics and programming. This book ties those fields together very nicely. I really wish I had a copy of this book earlier in my life as it is truly a goldmine of information. The code in this book is for MS DOS, *NOT* MS Windows. Windows handles the parallel port kinda funny and this code is for direct access (which Windows doesn't like). This means you can't run the code in a DOS window. I've adapted some of Paul's code for use on Linux (minimal rewriting) and for control of many laboratory instruments and data logging gear."
1,Bad,"This book is bad. It is poorly written and the programs did not work on my computer. Even the first project--intended as a simple confidence-builder--required that the code be completely rewritten. Deciphering the author's programming was maddening. Also, some of the projects are dumb: is anyone *really* going to build a burglar detector from this book?"
1,Book not helpful,This book did not help my computer needs. I recently purchased a book by another author which was much more helpful for half the price.
2,And the Point Is?,"This poorly written book (""cops"" is constantly used to designate the police or others investigating the ""crimes"" of the mother and son who are the ""stars"" of this book. The author seems to have rushed to print after ""cutting and pasting"" from numerous newspaper and magazines articles without even attempting to tell us why they behaved as they did and of course the book ends in the middle of the story. The murder charges are not resolved by the time the book hit the streets, but it seems to be like a trail in the wilderness.....the dam thing just ends. But, you are thankful that it is over because it was not quite bad enough to toss, and there was always hope that the next chapter would reveal the secrets of the admittedly strange mother and son, so you keep reading. But in the end you are quite unsatisfied and full of wonder about why some books are published. Since the story was not finished, I wondered what the point was of telling it."
3,The unbelievable Mrs Kimes,"Sante Kimes broke new ground as a murderous grifter in the 1990s. Jailed for enslaving maids, suspected of at least five murders, chased for insurance frauds and credit card scams...was there nothing this woman wouldn't do in pursuit of financial gain? And all with the help of her son Kenny. This book is one of four or five about Mrs Kimes and her life of crime. Like all the others, it unearths previously unknown detail. Together with Kent Walker's excellent Son of a Grifter and John Marquis's Evil and Son, it makes for great reading about one of the most compelling murder cases of modern times."
2,Hard to stay interested in this one.,"I am a fan of true crime books. I found this book a little uninteresting. I am not sure why exactly. Sante was outragous, her character alone should have held my interest if nothing else. Instead, I found even her to be a bit boring. Although I wasn't overly captivated by this book, it is a wild story that deserved to be written. Hard to believe that people will go to such great lenghts for money. Their exploits were risky, to say the least. Their greed was unreal, since they had more money when they started out than most average people have, yet they wanted more, more, more. Although it wasn't as gripping as I like my reading to be, I thank the writer for this story and am sure that there are others who will enjoy this book a bit more than I did."
2,Thinking About Consciousness?,"Think about buying a different book. The weakness doesn't lie in the case for materialism, rather, it is Papineau's mediocrity as a writer that sinks this endeavour. A short introduction starts off well enough, but even here one catches brief glimpses of the obfuscation ahead. A volley of muddled metaphors soon explode the page into a confused heaping jumble. Papineau himself states that he had planned on bypassing the dismal first chapter altogether. It is all too apparent that he should have heeded this initial instinct. Slog your way through this poorly written dry as dust tome and the occasional elucidating payoff can be expected."
1,Is old fogey Bennett still going ?,A review by an anonymous person. NOT FRED. I thought this fella had retired years ago. Surprised to see him doing a cd with Lady GaGa etc. Gaga sounds great but Tony = vile. I've listened to the samples and i think his voice is awful! Never have liked his vocals and i honestly think he sounds worse than ever. Time for Mr Bennett to definitely retire. Good idea blurring out his face on the cd cover makes him look less scary. Creepy music for creepy people! Just my opinion folks so don't get too upset. OK Bennett babes now you can attack me !
1,CD didn't work & Amazon won't let me return or exchange it,I ordered this for my husband's xmas present. We were so looking forward to listening to the album on New Year's Eve. The CD wouldn't play on either our cd player or our computers. All our other cds play just fine on our cd players & computers. I tried to contact Amazon and I was basically told to f@#k off. I want my money back & Amazon is treating me as if I don't exist. Amazon has the worst customer service ever!
1,Bennet & Gaga,"An utterly marvelous duet featuring Tony Bennet and Lady Gaga-- one of several duets on this CD -- bringing out the joining of the most disparate of soloists making music together, beautifully."
1,underwhelmved,"with so much star power, you would think this should be mind blowing off the hook.Well, you would be wrong.It's lacking soul, depth and charisma."
1,Damaged goods - CD,"I purchased Duets II (Tony Bennett cd) as a Xmas gift for a friend. She says it wasn't working properly, getting stuck on a certain song. I asked her to test it on another player and, apparently, the problem was replicated.Due to snow and power issues until today, was unable to retrieve the item to return it or get it replaced in the required timeframe - though, admittedly, have not checked to see if I could get an extension."
1,Prefer the actual correct version,"The cd consisted of the correct packaging with a CD of an Irish singer instead to the Tony Bennett CD, I have heard the Tony Bennett duets and they are quite fine. I bought this as a gift and had to return it to amazon because of a fluke. The factory placed the wrong CD into the WRONG cover and even though it was factory sealed, the wrong music was on the wrong CD."
1,Need information about Duets II,"Is the duet with Jackie Evancho (When You Wish Upon A Star) included in this album?If not, where can I find it. The track listing does not contain her."
1,THE TRUTH,"TONY BENNETT MUSIC IS AVERAGE, BUT HIS BELIEF THAT US GOVT WAS BEHIND 911 WELL THAT IS VERY STUPID, HE SHOULD STICK TOO HIS MUSIC"
1,wait for the 73 disc box set and the originals - not these remakes,"With such a great body of music recorded in the prime of his career available in just a few weeks, why spend money on inferior remakes like those included on Duets II (which, by the way, is the 73rd disc in the box set) when you can get the real deal in November! The original songs made famous by the original artist are far better than anything you'll find on this over-hyped under-delivered effort. Maybe he was thinking about that box while he made these inferior covers, since he seems distracted and bored throughout Duets II. He apparently said everything he had to say on the subject in Duets I."
1,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,Sounds like every other recent rehash from the Bennett inventory. A real snoozer. Regret this purchase; I'm going to ebay this one.
4,What's NOT to like?,"Well .... it's Tony Bennett ... what's NOT to like. Having seen him perform in person recently, I'm amazed at his consistency ... he seems to concede nothing to age as many singers do."
4,Love it!,WONDERFUL collection. I bought it mainly for the duet with Lady Gaga. They were beautiful together! I'd highly recommend it. Hope he makes a Duet III and includes Chaka Khan this time and Lady Gaga again!
4,Tony Bennett Duets II,"An outstanding CD collection. A great collection of contemporary artists, but it is Tony Bennett himself that shines through. The man is a silver tongued devil! Many classic hits - you do not get cheated in terms of content."
4,duets,excellent cd to help me relax on the way home from work- large variety of singers and types of music
1,Disappointing,"I love Tony Bennett! I loved the first Duets CD. This one is a far cry from the first and extremely disappointing. Among some of the things I disliked: He does two duets with two people who were on the first CD--Michael Buble and kd lang. I love Buble but really, Tony, aren't there others you can showcase. Also, he does the same arranged song ""How do you keep the Music playing"" with Aretha as was done on the first cd with George Michael. And while I'm not a George Michael fan, that version was far better than Aretha screaming it out. Don't get me started on the horrendous sounds of Amy Winehouse. And finally, Carrie Underwood should sue because no one would know that was her singing with Tony--not sure what they did to her voice but it wasn't good. Overall, the song selection has alot more unknown songs than popular/familiar songs. Just disappointing. Sorry Tony--maybe Duets III will be better!"
2,Was given as a gift,Someone gave me this as a gift. Someone who obviously doesn't know me too well. I think I was asleep by the second song.
1,tony Bennett,"This was a very big disapointment. I could not beleive how bad it was. Tony isn't singing , he is talking????? He should stick to painting."
5,Duet II,"Have no Tony Bennett CDs and never went wild over his songs but out of interest for the other contributors, I thought it might be interesting. Havent played it yet, but don't expect to be disappointed."
4,A Tender Reprise,"Tony Bennett is still elegant, even though age erodes his delivery a little. And I wish to put in a word for his excellent arrangers who enhanced the duets.Most of the singers were fine, with one notable weakness. Carrie Underwood lacks the resonance and timbre to sing along with Bennett, and her delivery was all too much paint-by-the number. Her voice is very thin."
4,Great music!,"While I am more of a rock and blues fan, I found this album very enjoyable. It is amazing that Tony Bennett still has his voice after all these years. Smooth, professional, and well done. Since I enjoy duets, this album fit the bill. I would recommend for any Tony Bennett fan or anybody else who enjoys duets and this style of music."
2,Ultimate Nastalgia,"Overwheling ones senses for a Icon 85. The more I listen the more I am totaly amazed how Tony still has such a great gift. Their are several artists who could have been left off,but they make him sound greater"
2,Too much of a good thing?????,"I have enjoyed Tony Bennett's style and interpretations of songs from the Great American Songbook for years. His Duets I CD was somewhat of a disappointment for a couple of reasons:1. Trying to mix Tony's style with that of another genre (ie. country, rock and roll, or whatever) does not always make for a good listening experience.2. Some of the songs ware never meant to be done as duets. It would take a fantastic arranger to make some of the songs work.All that being said, I decided to give Duets II a try thinking some of the above issues may have been resolved after learning from the mistakes on Duets I, but I was wrong. I enjoy an occasional duet on a solo artist's CD....it's a wonderful thing and can add variety and a new twist to the artist's repertoire. However, this was way too much variety for me! I still love Tony Bennett, and love most of the other artists on both CD's, but hopefully they will NOT attempt a Duets III CD."
3,Can't top the one with k. d. lang!,I had great hopes. Who would think anything with Norah Jones wouldn't be wonderful? They just don't mesh. Either of the prior two duet discs are much better with Wonderful World with k.d. lang being the the gold standard.
5,great album!,Tony Bennett still has it! He can sing across many different types af music and blend with many different types of voices. I highly recommend this album.
1,Tony Bennett Duets II,"Very sad with this recording. Tony waaay too loud singing over co-artists' voices and the beginning has VERY confusing advertising that takes you out of downloading (if you can even do it) and does not allow straight playing of the CD. I LOVED the Bennett with KD Lang, but this one is pathetic. Don't waste your $ on it. Sorry Tony. A loyal fan."
3,I was a little disappointed......,"I had heard great reviews about this CD. I received it for Christmas, couldn't wait to hear it! Maybe I expected too much. Don't misunderstand - It is good but not as great as I thought it would be."
2,"Nice try, but not nearly as good as prior efforts.","I have the first Duets CD, and I have the PBS fund-raising Duets special on my DVR. They both were nothing short of excellent, among the best of the best. This CD, on the other hand, seems like a theme gone stale. There are some good vocals, of course, Mr. Bennett, but also k.d. lang, Michael Buble, Norah Jones, and Natalie Cole populate my short list. There are also too many screechers on the disc who have trouble hitting the high notes, Lady Gaga, Sheryl Crow, Queen Latifah what ever possessed you to try to keep up with Mr. Bennett. You are so far out of your class, it hurt to listen. And then there's Aretha. It pained me to press ""skip"" halfway through her song, but I had to, as it was more painful to listen to it.If I had known then what I know now, I would not have bought this disc."
2,ok,"Listened to it 2 times and just did not care for some of the songs and the way he did them and who he did them with, so I wound up giving it to my girlfriend and her husband.Some songs just go with certain people."
5,Beautiful and Timeless: Tony Does it Again,"This is an amazing album, from top to bottom. I had no idea how versatile some of the singers could be such as Carrie Underwood, Lady Gaga, Amy Winehouse, etc. I really enjoyed every single performance.My favorites would have to be Carrie Underwood and Amy Winehouse, hands down. Both ladies capture a retro sound beautifully in their performances, and they compliment Tony very nicely.It is a very nice mix of yesterday meets today's artists, without cheapening it or destroying the original song.Bravo, Mr. Bennett. I see Grammys in your future (again!). :)"
3,Didn't top duet I,I thought some of the duets were just a solo performance for the guest singers. They lacked the harmony and some of the duets sounded like the guest performer was just screaming the lyrics of the song. I really enjoyed the first duet album. This one was not as good.
2,Diets II,Disappointing. I gave it away to the same person I gave the Viva Duets CD to. I just couldn't get into it.
3,Good disc,I bought this as a gift for my mother in law. She enjoys it. That is all that matters. The end.
3,Tony Bennett still awesome.,Lots of fun listening to popular artists singing standards with the still sexy-voiced 85 yr. old Tony. Enjoyed it enough to give as gifts.
5,FABULOUS,"Wow, old Tony still has what it takes to make an album. This album is a great chance for some of us older folks to get acquainted with younger singers. I was surprised to hear what a talented siner Lady Gaga is. Her rendition of The Lady is a tramp is energetic and fresh. The duet with Aretha is heart rending. After almosy 47 years of marriage I know that answer to the question How Do You Keep The Music Playing!! Amy Winehouse...what a voice!k.d. Lang and Tony singing ""Blue Velvet brought back memories of my young adulthodd. All in all, I think this is a fantastic album and would be a great gift to anyone, but most especially anyone over 55. Of course, the young folks will enjoy it too."
5,Love great music,"I love tony Bennett n I really love the singers he picked to do a duet with , I was right its a great album . If you want to hear great music get this album."
5,Tony Bennett - Duets 11,As usual this CD is great. Love every track and hope he gets to record a few more Duets before too long.
2,help,Well I bought this as a gift but it turns out she already has it. Now I would like to return it but that seems to be impossible. It will cost me half the amount of what I payed to return so I will be out money. I am better off to keep it even though I don't want it. An exchange would be nice but there is nothing wrong with it. So again.. I'm stuck. I just think it is frustrating and felt like giving my feedback since you asked!
3,I liked Duets I better,"I love Tony Bennett was much as everyone else, but here's the thing: with all the great songs out there, why remake the SAME ones you did in a PREVIOUS album? I have NO IDEA why Mr. Bennett did this, and frankly, I felt that it was insulting to the artists who sang those songs with him on Duets I. It's almost as if Mr. Bennett didn't think those cuts were good enough, so he's choosing to redo them on a later album. I'm sure that wasn't his intention, but it certainly could be interpreted as such.This just wasn't as sensational as the first (Duets) CD. And I love Tony Bennett. I was really disappointed. But having said that, it's not the worst CD I own either. I regret not waiting to buy this CD used."
3,Great artists,The artists were great but the big band horns were too much for me. They were way too loud and took the enjoyment out of it for me.
5,Great Tony Bennet CD,It is a great cd. All his music is good. Tony Bennett is a great singer. Go and get it.
5,Tony Bennett Duets II,"Love, love, love Tony! I really like the diverse group of people he sings with on this album. It was a nice surprise to hear such a variety of voices. When you gather a group that includes icons such as Aretha Franklin and Willie Nelson, it has to be good. Having Amy Winehouse as one duet was bittersweet. It is a great album, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys classic hits sung by contemporary artists."
5,Tony Bennett lives on!!!,A talent that is ageless. His voice still rings with such harmony and grace. He is an icon!!!! Go Tony!!!
4,okay,I bought this because I was hoping to find them cheaper than they were in the stores. This was just as good as ordering from the company! I would recommend them to anyone.
4,Tony Bennett CD,It's Tony Bennett - what's not to like? Plus like that he did duets with others so makes it more diversified.
2,disk problems,"i have had 2 copies of duets 2, both from amazon. my computer will not recognize either of them, although they will play on my cd player. however, i cannot add the songs to my ipod or computer. this is the first and only time i am experiencing this problem on my late-model imac, which runs itunes and osx 10.6.8. i have tried other disks (including duets 1) and they all operate perfectly. this is very puzzling."
4,Enjoyable,We have enjoyed this CD. Tony Bennett continues to amaze with his gifted voice and especially at his age. He still sounds clear as a bell.
2,mrs from delaware,"I was very disappointed in the whole cd.At some points I would have rather heard one or the other but not together. I was especially disappointed in Ms. Franklin and her version of ""How do you keep the music playing."" If I could return it I would."
4,I Enjoyed It,"I belong to the generation who spent 60s and 70s as teenagers. I have listened to only a few of Bennett's hit songs before. Actually, I enjoyed this album, because performances of each duet partner is sparkling through the duets. Lady Gaga's powerful singing with the big band is delightful and the tune is the best Jazzy duet in the album. k.d. lang's mellow, comforting voice embraces Bennett. Aretha Franklin sings in her great way. Her style is very different from that of Bennett's, but the tune has come out as a wonderful love song. The excellent talents jump over the difference of genres. His voice is still strong! Great production work!"
4,Great listening,"It was a pleasure listening to Mr. Bennett perform with such a variety of artists, oldies and those of the younger set. My favorites were among them,Grobin, Gaga, Nelson & Bouble. Thanks."
5,Masterpiece!!,this album is worth the purchase.Im happy to know that Queen Latifah is on the album and other artists of the future.
5,LOVE TONY FOREVER AND EVER,I HONOR Tony Bennet with the purchase of this Cd immediately to show support for his sponken truth. I KNOW this CD will be as great as the ones I already have of his music. THANBK YOU TONY.
5,brilliant!,"This book was massively entertaining. I lent it out to my father, and he loved it too. You need to enjoyed quirky and offbeat stories with some grit to them, if you are going to dig this. This is not Jane Austen. I just started reading the next volume of Best of the South, and I am loving that one too. Highly recommended."
3,Silvertip,"It was an ok read. Some what dated (as written in a style I remember from my youth which is many, many years ago) I did enjoy it tho."
4,Max Brand-Silvertip,"Good Western Writer, Has plot that you can follow and keeps you interested, Good Read.I read books i don't write them so can't think what else to say."
2,Silvertip,"An OK western. As a kid I would have been happily pleased with it. Given the time that it was written, it isn't bad - but likely my last reading."
3,a little disapointed,"I don't usually read dusters. This one was entertaining to a point, but I couldn't understand the motivation of the main character."
2,Hideous Sound Quality,"For a recording released on a fairly well known label, this disaster sounds like a bootleg recorded on a cassette recorder. It's not even in stereo! You can BARELY hear the drums in the background and there is absolutely NO sound separation or balance. Avoid this one like the plague!!!"
3,A good book that was poorly edited,"I used Dr. Ford's text in a Research Design class. The book contains some nice nuggets of wisdom but you have to dig for them. The text is very ""wordy"" and often confusing. If this 600 page book would have been edited properly it would have made for an excellent 300 page publication. It seems as though the author tried to create a linear development on how to properly conduct scientific research, but somehow you get lost in the many definitions and the nth degree detail. The book does contain some good examples and some nice diagrams. Overall this book is useful as a reference tool but not as a primary text."
2,The worst of the Trilogy,"Though reasonably well written, the obvious nationalist biased history, race prejudice, misinformation and romantic view of the nobility and war add up to a pile of paper that could have been better used. As a Pole and a fan of Sienkiewicz this novel is disappointing."
5,The best written novel ever in a faithful translation.,"Without reciting the book cover, this book and the trilogy it came from is one of the finest pieces of literature ever created. It is easy to quickly consume and dispose of a Steven King novel or any in the popular genre, but the skillful crafting or characters and fascinating plot in Sienkiewicz trilogy deserves the respect and admiration of any one who claims to love literature.I suggest it strongly. Reading it was a life changing experience for me. Consistent with the theme, it truly ""uplifts the hearts."" Of the Polish nation and now with the masterful translation by Kuniczak, a young man in the United States too!"
2,Forgettable Gordimer Stories,"Is it bad to knock a Nobel Prize Winner? Most of these stories were unmemorable. The scenery and situations were unique, but the characters were often uninteresting and underdeveloped (even by some short story standards). As one who has read almost all of Nadine Gordimer's work (including the discredited and horribly edited Ronald Suresh Roberts biography of her), I left unimpressed and uninspired."
3,After playing for one hour...,"There is a lot of text in this game. I say, ""Enough with this reading, lets play the game"". The graphics and the music are nothing spectacular. There are better games out there. From what I've seen so far, I think they would have had a better game if they'd just ported over the code from the old ""Super Star Wars"" game on the Super Nintendo. The game play is very similar to that older game. You run around as Luke, shooting things. I'm guessing it's a bit redundant for me. And I know my five year old won't enjoy having to press the button to skip over all that text. Hope George Lucas puts our money to good use and deliver us an awesome movie next Summer."
3,Not Bad,"This is a pretty good game for the GBA that takes you through the original 3 movies; in a game. It's a pretty good game, but it's also not that great. here's my review:Graphics: 3.5/5. The graphics are not that great. You can not see the characters faces, the landscapes are a bit sloppy and boring, but hope the characters move and everything is great.Sound: 4.5/5. The sound is pretty good. Has original music, and sounds from the animals and all. Blaster pistol noises, Jawas, Sand People.. but like most handheld games, no voice acting.Control: 5/5. Can't get simplre. To shoot sideways just hold L, to jump press A, to shoot press B. Really easy.Fun: 4/5. This is one of the best, if not the best, Starwars handheld games I've ever played, but it is still not better than the platform games. This game follows episodes 4-6, and does a fair job, but it also does it rather quickly, cheaply, and using repetetive level design."
3,Frustrating!,"This game looks nice and for the most part, plays quite well. But there are parts of the game that can be very frustrating. In my book, you have to balance the toughness of competition and accomplishment with frustration. When a game goes too far to the frustration side, what is the point of it?"
3,the game rocks-literally,"hey, i don't know about the game as i don't have it but as far as the game screenshots posted on the gamespy website go , this game is sure to rock as we relive the memorable scenes of the star wars trilogy. Even in here in Nepal, i heard about the movie during 1993 which is quite recent but very few knew about the movie then as very few had television let alone vcrs. i rented the video and later watched all three movies in the trilogy even as many of my friends were oblivious of the movie's success in the west. So this game brings out old memories and is sure to be one of the best liscenced games out there. 3 thumbs up because i haven't played it yet but i sure will get a copy soon as i can."
3,r make doubly sure your kid will like this game/keep reciept,"My son bought this game two days after his birthday with his birthday money. Decided it didn't like after playing it for two days. BUT he lost his receipt so of course ToysRus would not refund his money. This took place at a local ToysRus store. I thought by scanning the bar code on the box that the store could tell that it came/purchased from this particular store. The manager said the barcode is universal..blah, blah. I highly questioned that. The sales lady kept blabbing that it was their policy not to refund money for a video game that has been opened with no receipt. I said there is also a policy about customer satisfaction also!! But to no avail. So we ended up taking the game to E B games for resale. Course my son lost out on some of his money. I have spent quite a bit of money at ToysRus locally and online. However, now I will certainly think TWICE before giving them anymore business."
5,''AALIYAH''my role modle,"i didn't know about AALIYAH until she died,because i live in jamaica AALIYAH is not big here,people know the really big rap singers in america like lilbowwow.but when AALIYAH died i was in miami and i saw the news about her and i ask my sister who she was my sister asked me if i didn't know her i said no my sister told me she was the one who sang ''TRY AGAIN & WE NEED A RESOLUTION''and i remembered her and from that day on i became a big fan i just fell inlove with her not because she died i just became a big fan but because i love her and i always will DAMON,DIANE,MICHAEL,RASHAD,STACY,MISSY,TIMBALAND,GINUWINE,ME[SHANELLE]and all your fans out there will always love you R.I.P.BABYGIRL,R.I.P."
2,not impressed,"i have owned all of her previous material and was not very impressed with this latest album!!i really had high hopes for this one due to the wonderful recent tunes of ""try again"" and ""are you that somebody"". there are about 6 songs that i feel could grow on me ie...we need a resolution, i care for you, loose rap, more than a woman, never no more, and i refuse.Actually, ""i refuse"" is my favorite !!! the song ""what if"" really gets on my last nerve!!it sounds so chaotic and nervewracking!!!Miss Aaliyah i love your voice and persona, but there's got to be some better music out there that could compliment your voice in a much better way ie like ""try again and r-u that somebody"" did!!! tell your record company to get busy!!!!"
5,AALIYAH ONE IN A MILLION,AALIYAH'S NEW CD IS THE BEST R&B CD EVER!IT HAS DOPE BEATS AND LYRICS. I ENJOY ALLOF THE SONGS ON THE CD.I BELIEVE EVERYONESHOULD GO AND GET IF U DONT ALREADY HAVE IT.I GIVE IT A FIVE ITS THE BEST!RIP LIYAH
4,GREAT!...But not her best.,"I loved and still love Aaliyah for her amazing talents in music and movies, and I bought this long before she died. I was looking foward to this CD since her role in Romeo Must Die. She again proves that she is the little princess of R&B has grown into a woman. However,I still like One In A Million better, but only by one star, mainly because I like the vibe of it better. But this is still an amazing CD from and artist who died long before her artistic peak. It really does show her amazing voice and range. My favorite song is More Than A Woman because of it's great dance beats and amazing vocals. I like many others was sad when I heard the news of her death. I remember her just as she wanted to be remembered as she said on MTV's Diary. She was an entertainer, someone who could do it all. GET THIS CD!!! IT'S GREAT!!"
4,REVISIT A LONG LOST GENRE....,"ahhh,the good old days when absolutely nothing was safe or sacred to the exploitation movie merchants....here we have,in my opinion,probably the most tasteless example of the Naziploitation picture,a genre that more or less died shortly after this ""movie"".most would probably agree that that is a good thing.anyway,about the movie.for the uninitiated,start with ""ilsa - she wolf of ss"".if you can ""enjoy"" that bit of nastiness,then perhaps consider taking on this ""unique"" take on a forgotten film genre.just dont watch it with your mom or girlfriend.or aunt.or grandma.etc..."
1,Platts Starport Guide,"With a combanation of central star wars locales, such as Ryll ( the home of the secound most common ganster race) and the Kuat transfer center (Kuat is home of the Kuat Drive Yards), as well as new and interesting places, explore the galexy with this amazing book. The illustrations are lush, and the book is superb. Find yours in a garage sale near you!"
4,A very readable account of this most notorious family,"After checking out 'The Fall of the House of Borgia' by E.R. Chamberlain from our local library and reading it, I am left with the insatiable desire to own the book. It is so hard to take such a book back and say good bye to such a good friend.E. R. Chamberlain, without losing the reader in a myriad of historical gobbledegook gives enough information to establish the stepping stones of the major events of this most notorious family. Although not much is said of Calixus, the book gets into high gear with the life of Rodrigo, and follows the rise of Caesar, the peak of the short lived dynasty, and the precipitous fall. Caesar's exile in Spain, as well as his escape is tantamount to existing in a house with a serpent that is missing from it's cage. And then the end... of this most dangerous, tormented man. Again my conviction is confirmed: no novel rivals real life.~ Giovanni Alessi"
1,disappointed nephew on christmas,I ordered this on November 2nd for my nephew and amazon PROMISED me it would be here by December 22nd. It never got there and I was never notified that they didn't even HAVE the product until I called customer service! No one ever told me that they didn't have the product in stock. My nephew was so disppointed that he did not get any Christmas presents from us and no one has accomodated me yet - I AM DONE WITH AMAZON!!!
2,A goal for the author but not for the reader,"I commend the author for sharing her personal journey with us but I must say that you don't need to buy this book in order to experience how gastric bypass affects a patient. Just attend a FREE support group in your area or log on to one of the many FREE websites for obesity, such as obesityhelp.com. I want to make it clear that I support the author in her decision to write down her personal experiences but the support groups are much better!!!"
2,Not an awesome read by any means....,This lady does tell it like it is in her case..I really didn't learn anything new or find it too interesting. I would pick it up at a doctors office but honestly I wouldn't buy it to help or sway my decision about weight loss surgery.
4,Quick and Informative Read,This book was a very personal book and easy to read with a lot of information. The surgeon who performed the surgery also put his input in this. Great Book!
5,*MUST READ* - an honest account in days of dishonest hype.,"In days where gastric bypass is the new ""thing to do"" Melissa does an amazing job of explaining the struggle, complications, and ultimate success that the surgery brought to her life.This book is not only an easy read (i did it in one sitting!) but is also one of the only books I've read that tells it like it is. Melissa is obviously a very brave individual; her amazing story is a must read for anyone who is considering the surgery. Phat Finish is a true account of triumph."
5,Perfect size gumballs!!,"I have a 6 foot gas tank gumball machine and these were the perfect size and quantity amount, just about filled it up!! not too small and not to big, just the right size."
5,gumballs,Bought a big gumball machine and have 3 boxes of these in so far. Will probably take two more to fill it. Tasty treat and the neighbor kids love it.
3,Celtic T-Shirt,The shirt was Beautiful!! I was very impressed. It did take a few days longer to ship than I was expecting. But it still arrived in time. So I am happy.
4,Pretty Good,I got what I prdered on the last day of the estimated shipping time. the book ws new but was a different version than the one I thought I was getting. The photo online is of a newer verion than the one I got.
4,Fascinating Twist on a Cliche,"This book is well worth reading, especially if you liked ...And Ladies of the Club. It's a less amibitious book, but a finely wrought one. It takes all the cliches of the coming-of-age novel and transcends them at the same time as it sheds a new light on them. The main character is entirely believable, as is the resolution of her dilemma."
4,Tight album,"This album is definitely an improvement over the first since it's much more consistent. Tray Deee really shines on this album and proves he's a skilled and talented emcee and belongs with the elite of west coast emcees like Xzibit, Crooked I, Del, and Ras Kass. Goldie Loc is a good complement to Tray Deee's aggressive style. However the strength of this album is the music. Battlecat, DJ Hi-Tek, Fredwreck, et al give this album a dope, funky, musical ride with influences from 70's era funk combined with new school hip hop. The combination worked brilliantly. This album is maybe 2 week cuts from being a masterpiece but as far as I'm concerned this is a must buy."
2,Worst than the first one...,"This Eastsidaz comeback is pretty wack. A piece of garbage, really wack. Don't waste your money on this. Altough they got the help frok such names as Alchemist, Hi- Tek (one of the few good moments on the CD) the majority of the songs r pretty wack, even that collabo with Mobb Deep. It seems that Snoop can't handle Tray Dee & Goldie Loc...If this two were alone in the game, they'd never sell so well...They must thank Snoop for their sucess. The first one is OK, pure G-Funk, but this is something I can't describe...Snoop & his crew really disapointed me...By the way his dogghouse record's roster is a lack of talent like no other label in the game, they got Doggy's Angels which is garbage too...`cause right now he's on some downfall..."
4,4.5 Stars,"This is westcoast history right here.Tha Eastsidaz (Tray Deee & Goldie Loc) and Snoopa raps over great beats. Even though Fred Wreck's tracks arent mastered as well as they should have been (or so it sounds) this is still the shiaaat.Who is on the record? Fred Wreck, Kokane, Soopafly, Suga Free, Butch Cassidy, Battlecat, Nate Dogg, DJ Pooh, Mixmaster Spade, Kurupt, RBX & Bad Azz...nuff said BUY THIS!"
2,Snoop Once again cannot deliver with his Eastsidaz,"This album, much like the Eastsidaz debut in early 2000 is about 20 trax each of bad music... I know Snoop is trying to bring back g-funk, but with Tray-Dee, and Goldie Loc, it ain't workin. To me, if Tray and Goldie did gangsta rap only they could get very far in the game, but as of now, don't look for this cd to buy."
3,Another average Snoop Dogg affiliated album,"Snoop seemed to be doing well. He just released his best solo effort since Doggystyle, and the first Eastsidaz album went platinum, but then he had to release this. It isn't terrible, but it is no where as good as say, Tha Last Meal, or even Top Dogg. Snoop just fares better alone and his albums prove it. Anyways, about this album. It isn't terrible, but it definetly isn't worth purchasing for the 3 great tracks (""I Luv It"", ""Eastside Ridaz"" and ""There Comes A Time""), which you can just download. The production on this album is shaky at best, which results in an average album since Tray Dee and Goldie Loc don't bring anything special on the mic. I'm glad the Eastsidaz aren't on Snoop's label anymore, and that he has once again put out another quality solo album."
4,Snoop is NOT a CRIP anymore,"snoop and tha eastsidaz give a bad name to CRIPPIN', thats all im gunna say about that. however if you discuss there music its no that bad. most of there songs work pretty well, if you consider tha weak beats they were provided with. about the crippin, maybe snoop and tha gang (tray and goldie) used to be CRIPs, but not anymore. snoop used to kick it with suge knight a well known blood. in fact he used to rap for his record label. and as far as i'm concerned i've been to east L.B 19th 21st and 18th, and while there not ""suburban paradise"" (there far from it in fact) they are still no breeding ground for slobs and CRIPs."
5,Da bomb,"Snoop Dogg has, in this currentera of pop culture decivilization of talentless pop icons and washed up wanna be rappers, become the GEORGE CLINTON OF OLD SKOOL GANGSTA RAP."
3,what not old fashioned enough,"the first eastsidaz was the bomb,this is slacking. some of these songs are tight-others are weak if snoop wants the george clinton-bootsy-zapp sound so bad hire those muds.i'm not against sampling the funk but if you do please do it right."
4,I Gotta Get This Joint,"I got a sample of the song ""Connected"" featuring Mobb Deep from SOHH.com's SOHH Wireless service and I can't wait for my copy to get here."
4,Good tool,"This is one of 3 tools I purchased from this line. They are all great, and are the only tools I use. They has never failed me, and they are quite durable. Kind of heavy, but I like it that way. Makes it feel like its heavy duty."
2,There's more than one with this title & I didnt get the one described,"I got the wrong book - not the one pictured. It was a Hallmark Book also, but not by Mary Burrows. It was not a children's book."
4,Great Source for family tree,This book has short bios of men who fought at the Battle of San Jacinto. It includes the average guy not just the famous ones. It even includes pictures of some. I was excited to find a picture of my great grandfather. This is a reprint and the printing quality is not as good as the original.
4,Chose Amazon First,My son is a railroad junkie and finding the rare VHS tapes he likes is easy on Amazon. I always check Amazon first for anything I'm looking for!
1,Let This Be A Voice (VHS),"This, I have heard, is a great vhs. I bought this but had to return it as it would not play and i was very disappointed. I have heard that oft times a vhs will just wear out from age, not always usage. I was credited immediately and in the future i imagine I will once again try to purchase it. As I said, I have heard it is wonderful."
2,Vocal style greatly detracts,"I have been a fan of Mr. Simpson for over a decade, after seeing him in a riveting live performance. Unfortunately he has somehow changed either the way he sings or the way he mixes his vocals into the recording because his vocals now greatly detract from the incredible musical skill you hear. I think I will stand pat with the many earlier recordings I so enjoy."
2,annoying vocals,simpson cannot sing. his vocals are horrible and not in a good way (like kottke). this is one annoying album.
4,Jimmy Smith's First Three Blue Note Albums on Two CDs,"~ Although the title of the listing here on Amazon implies that this CD contains only Jimmy Smith's first Blue Note album (Blue Note 1512) it actually contains Jimmy Smith's first three Blue Note albums (Blue Note 1512, 1514, 1525) plus four previously unreleased tracks and one track that had previously only been available on a 45-single (Blue Note 45-1652). However, rather than purchase this expensive import, you can obtain the same material for a lot less money on the Blue Note 2-CD setNew Sound New Star.~ See my review ofNew Sound New Star"
1,Save your money!,"This product didn't work at all on my 2000 Ford Explorer radio, and turned out to be unnecessary anyway. There are only two screws and a couple of push in retainers that hold the center facia (trim cover) to the dashboard. Remove the screws underneath the radio opening and gently pull the facia forward, the radio and facia come oome out as one assembly. Once removed, the radio reatainer clips and electrical connections are easy to disengage."
3,"Ok for price, but flimsy","Eventually, these worked to remove the factory installed DIN radio in my Ford Focus. They bent way too easily though. Many times I had to pull them back out, bend them back in shape, and try again. Like I said though, they did eventually get the job done. The similarly priced item at Wal-Mart works better, and doesn't bend."
3,Flimsy tool,"This radio removal tool got the job done, but it was rather difficult because the tool was not as study as I was expecting. After removing the radio, it was quite the task to remove one of the tools from the radio itself because it was so bent. Essentially, this was only good for one use."
5,Did the job,"Nice and cheap, but was able to easily remove the radio on my '97 Mazda Miata. Great buy, great deal."
4,Witchi-Tai....What?,"I didn't know if it was ""Water Spirit Spinning, Spinning"", or ""Spring Spirit Spinning"", or what, but it was stuck in my head one night and I finally Googled it to track down the words and then succumbed to the impulse and bought this recording. I didn't know Brewer and Shipley from Adam and Eve and still don't, but there are a few catchy tunes on this recording and I like it well enough."
3,CD WITH SUPPOSED AUTO-RIP,"THE AUTO-RIP FEATURE DIDN'T WORK .I AM A BREWER & SHIPLEY FAN; 'HAVE BEEN SINCE THE 70'S. WHEN I FOUND THIS RECORDING, I WAS HAPPILY SURPRISED TO SEE THE AUTO-RIP OFFER.HOWEVER, ONLY 2 SONGS FROM THE ALBUM ARE SHOWING UP ON MY CLOUD-PLAYER. THE SOUND ON THOSE TWO IS FLAT AND DOESN'T HAVE MUCH DEPTH.I HAVEN'T TRIED OUT THE CD YET. I HOPE THE SOUND IS BETTER....I'M REALLY STILL A FAN OF VINYL..."
3,Missing A&M tracks,"Unfortunately, this compilation is limited to the Brewer and Shipley material released on Kama Sutra/Buddha. Brewer and Shipley originally started out on the A&M label with a single eponymous album. The quality of the music on the A&M album was a magnitude better than that released on Kama Sutra/Buddha, inasmuch as it was more ""progressive/underground FM"" oriented. It would have been nice to include some of the tracks from the A&M label (my fave is ""Green Bamboo"")on this compilation through cross-licensing."
5,A Gift For My Sister,"My sister had asked for this Bible. She had one, but in a recent move from MD to NY, it was lost. She loves this version of the Bible."
5,Today's Light Bible - NIV,"An informative, easy to understand version of the Holy Bible. Makes reading the Bible easier and more enjoyable."
1,badminton shuttlecock lights,I did't realize they were not battery operated and ordered them....I never used them. I wouldn't have ordered them If I had realized what they were. they are too heavy for badminton shuttlecocks
1,Missing In Action,"I really cant speak on their preformance because I never recieved them. I can't get in touch with anyone to relate my problem to have them re-shipped to me, so I figured I would at least let everyone know: If you don't recieve your order in full, you never will. I also ordered the Badmitton Family pack which I recieved. But I never recieved the Pro Performance Speedmitton 8Pk Speedlights: Which I really wanted to try out,Pro Performance Speedminton 8pk Speedlightsnot to mention I paid for.............."
2,Really not worth it..,"I had purchased these with high hopes. Oh, and the special shuttle cock, sold separately of course. They do not last that long and they aren't very bright. In addition, it was definitely evident that some were brighter than others as we had 3 different games going at once. By the time you can see the light, it is too late to position yourself for an accurate volley. It's a neat idea, but these need to be brighter. Perhaps if they were LED.."
4,"Good but overpriced, get 50 for the same price","These are good, but that's a lot to spend. These are just standard mini glow sticks often used for fishing, like these:50 Mini Green Glow Nitro Light Sticks Small Night Fishing Float Rod"
3,it could've gone better,"the product only took a few days to get here, and it looks very cool. however, be aware that it's very fragile. within a week or so, i accidentally dropped it on the floor and the parts holding it in the case broke :( unfortunately, because this is the second time the product broke (the first one DID last a little longer before i dropped it) i think i will go for something more durable next time. in addition, the surface is prone to scratches. nevertheless, it never ceases to look cool. if you're a careful user, i would recommend the case."
1,Monster,I am sorry I can't give you a response to this Order> Because I never Receive it? There was Problems with the Delivering of the Package from the Post Office?
2,Did I read the same book?,"I think I must have read a different book. I didn't think this was well-written at all. The alpha hero had yellow eyes and long hair---an ewwww from the start. I didn't like how he manhandled Addie and their love scenes were a bit on the rough side, which is a turn off. Their ""witty"" dialogue and antics came off immature. And where was the romance? This could have been a much better book had the author taken the time to really develop the characters and insert some tenderness from time to time."
5,bob and rob,beautiful photography from bianchi and beautiful subjects to admire. this is a must have if you are a fan of bob and rob and admire the sensational works of tom bianchi!
1,Neither informative nor compassionate,"The Door is Open is neither compassionate nor informative. The information given through the memoirs can be discovered from any news report on the homeless without the vulgar language. If the language was in context with the language used by those living on the street I would be more accepting. But this was the writers own words which did not help convey the message he was trying to get across. As well any female readers will be offended by terminology used to describe the women on the street. If this book was made into a movie it would be rated ""R"" or ""NC17"" for language.The book also never conveyed any short of compassion from the writer. Bart Campbell was not working at the soup kitchen because he had a heart for the homeless, but to cover up his own pain from the separation with his wife. I believe he stated it best in one of his memoirs, ""I hang out at The Door is Open because I want to make my life more meaningful"". This is not a book of compassion!"
2,Disappointed,"Bouth this for my 16 year old kid and it was broken in less than a month, really disappointed!!"
5,Get it for the live tracks - great live Goo!,"This is a release of the single ""Broadway"" but the real winners on this disc are the second track ""Naked"" (which begins with an amazing drum solo by Mike Malinin) and the third track ""Black Balloon"". Having seen them in concert this summer, the live tracks really capture the concert performance quality of the Goos. If you want to experience their live performance (without the screaming fans or the mosh pit) buy this CD!"
4,great scent,"but a bit hard to apply. Have to really rub it hard to get enough warmth to get it up to apply. It is not fluid at all, but seems to do the job once it get on. And it really is my favorite scent from them"
3,Brownsville Worship CD,I was disappointed because the album songtitles on the CD itself were totally from a different album by the same group. I loaded the CD on my computer and had to change every song title. The songs labeled in the album cover were the same as the songs on the cd except when loaded on my computer it listed an entirely different group of songs. That why I had to retype the songs to correspond correctly. Since I paid full price for the album I wasn't expecting to have to make these corrections. I will just get my music next time from iTunes.
5,No house arrangements in here!,"I love this book because it preserves the rough edges that the music of everday people has. If JR learned the verse to a song that didn't rhyme, she didn't ""fix"" it. The melodies are often asymmetrical, the ballads often have odd twists to their stories, and the emotion is just pure.If you're looking for a book of songs for the camp-fire, this may not be it. If you're looking for the real songs of Appalachia, look no further."
4,very cute costume but pricey,"I thought this costume was very cute. It does run a bit small though so I think my toddler is going to have to go with just a diaper under the costume but luckily it is very warm. My son wears a size 18 mo in pants and 24 months or 2t in shirts and the costume is snug. I also think that the price is ridiculous for a costume he's going to wear only one night but luckily grandma was willing to pay that price!! It is very cute, cuter on a little guy than the picture looks on the site actually."
3,Didn't we read this before?,"When I read the book about Elizabeth's internship,it somehow reminded me about Sweet Valley High when she got another internship.The plot's about the same.And I really wish that Will just dump Melissa for good,he deserves someone better than her.Only Jessica's attitude in the book kept me reading the book."
5,Timex Atlantis 100 TM 77511,"Very happy with this purchase. ProSportWatches.com is a great etailer, fast shipping, low prices, and item received was exactly as described.Highly recommend!Jerry - PA"
5,Start to finish awesome!!,"This book was a excellent read I found it most interesting I was sad the chapter was ending and excited the next was beginning , I will be wanting to read this again cant wait for the squeal Anything I might add might ruin the ending ."
5,Best Foreman Bagain Ever!!!,This set usually only comes around once a year and every year I grab it as it is a quality deal. For a gift or personal use this grill does it all. Hold 2 average sized burgers and grills everything else reasonably well. The toaster is an average good one and having the water warmer is an extra plus although I only use it once a year. The big deal here is the price so go for it.
4,Great for apartment or dorm life...,"The grill, hot pot, and toaster make a great addition to any apartment of a student on a budget."
4,I love it,"Perfect for the bachelor or college student. You can cook anything you want on the grill and the toaster is a must. The only drawback is the size, but if you're cooking for yourself this should be perfect."
4,Collectors beware - rarities,This CD is very interesting for Kinks Kompletists. The version of 'Supersonic Rocket Ship' is an early version which had the intro wiped by accident and the group had to re-record the song. The version of 'Celluloid Heroes' is an alternate mono recording (and a superior version to the original) and 'Moving Pictures' is not the definite version but a rough mix. How about that?
5,Truly an Adventure!,"Each episode produces revelations such as the origin of the New England Primer and the Blueback Speller, which included strict pronunciation rules. So determined were our forebears to erase class distinctions of speech, that they taught schoolchildren common pronunciation intending that any child born and educated in the U.S., no matter how humbly born, could be elected president."
5,interesting story and a must-have for teachers of the english language,"Until today I haven't been able to watch the DVD because I live in Germany which is really annoying (nevertheless it deserves 5 points!!), but I know this documentation from the internet and I can really recommend it. It gives a good overview of the history of English and in my opinion it is a must-have for teachers of the English language. I based an English lesson on the section about Old and Middle English because it offers good illustrative material, which might be interesting for students of English. Another important point is the pronunciation of Melvyn Bragg which can be understood really well, even by non-native speakers of English!"
5,Fabulous!,"Lord Bragg's knowledge of and enthusiasm for his subject matter infuses each episode with delight. Who knew English could be so interesting? Highly recommended for anyone interested in the history of our language, whether a native-speaker or immigrant."
5,Wonderful,"As a high school English teacher, I have used several clips of this DVD set...it's really wonderful. I used the section on African-American dialects when I taught ""Huckleberry Finn."" I used the section on Middle English when I taught ""Canterbury Tales."" I used the portion on Shakespeare when I taught ""The Tempest."" Great stuff, and very detailed and interesting."
4,Great series,"While not as good as the original BBC version, this later BBC version is still a great resource for anyone who loves the English language. Although it moves rather quickly, it is still an in depth look as to the reasons the English language has survived thoughout the ages to become a major language in the world today."
5,About Freakin' Time,"This is a wonderful series. Melvyn Bragg is a total nerd who dresses atrociously, but the material is so fascinating and flows so well that appearances don't count for much. The show runs from time to time on History International, I believe, so catch it there if you're unconvinced. Me, I'll be ordering the DVDs.I don't know what the hold-up has been, but will be glad to see this long-overdue DVD set. I may wait for Blu-ray if that release looks likely."
4,soundtrack from Must Love Dogs,Feel good romance movie. You can't miss with Diane Lane and John Cusack. Excellent cast.
2,review from Synthesis,"So apparently for this flick you must not only love dogs, but bad soundtracks as well. I don't know what's going on here, but I don't like it. The CD is comprised of a mix of country songs and overused classics that need to be left alone. There's a decent song or two from artists like Ryan Adams, but a song or two can't always save an entire album. The final straw of my annoyance with this CD would have to be the last track, straight from the movie I'd imagine, where the actors get together and sing ""Come On Get Happy."" Maybe this is supposed to be funny.....I'm not laughing. Maybe the whole album is suppose to be funny, but to me it seems like one big, corny, Hollywood joke.Robin BaciorSynthesis.net"
2,"Cute, but too floppy to hold a cord securely","I have portable devices and they always seem to have too much cord. I thought the fishbone design was cool and bought one of these things, but it is really floppy and the cords always seem to work their way loose from the ends. I don't hate it, but I won't get another one."
5,Works,"My headphones no longer just tangle around in my purse.Only downfall is my cat has stollen this off the counter more than once.Not sure what the deal is with that, but it's pretty funny."
2,fishbone cord wrap,It does not hold the cord as expected. The edges were also rough cut. Thought it would be little more sturdier. This one is just cut out of a thick rubber.
3,Masterful presentation,"This video covers the basic kettlebell exercises but falls short of perfection. Pavel leaves you wanting more material and fails to give the viewer a sample beginner workout to expand on. I know it is a technique only video but I want the most bang for my buck, and expect the producer to go the extra mile. If you could afford it it's a good buy : worth the price of good technique for avoiding injury. If you're cheap like me Everthing on the vid can be found on youtube with a little bit of patience. Save your money for the actual kettlebells."
3,my review,"I was disappointed with with the dvd because I was looking for a program to follow in my workout. However, this dvd is about the basics in kettlebell workout. Nonetheless, it's must have for proper form in your workout."
2,"Disappointed, this is outdated.","Dragon Door and Pavel have split up. This book needs revision to be up to date with current KB practices.I've read 4 of Pavels' books so far, not too impressed with any of them, although I did get a few good kernels out of them. Check the library!Let's just say, for all the hundreds of things you can do with a KB for strength and conditioning, this is really missing the mark, by a long shot.On the plus side, the book is of high quality materials and publishing. Aesthetically pleasing!"
3,Good Information on Select Basics,"This is an instructional DVD that thoroughly illustrates proper form for a handful of basic kettlebell moves. If you are looking for a kettlebell work-out DVD to do at home this is not the one for you. If you are looking for a single DVD that shows how to perform a lot of kettlebell exercises then this is also not the one for you. What it provides is clear instructions on how to perform basic kettlebell exercises such as the swing, snatch, get-up and press. The exercises that are presented are well done, with good instruction and examples of how to do them properly. I gave this three stars because it covered so few exercises - if there had been more exercises included I would have given it five stars."
5,An excellent DVD for learning the basic exercises using the Kettlebells.,"Even though I had read the book by the same name, there is nothing like seeing the exercises in a DVD to more clearly understand the material. Pavel is well-known for creating interest in the use of the Kettlebell. Even though I am way past my prime and old age is upon me; nevertheless, I found that I could perform most of the movements in the DVD. The only one I could not perform because of my physical limitations, was the ""Get-up"" exercise. The DVD follows the information given in the text book and I think getting both of these products is a good idea.In conclusion, if you are seeking expert instruction on how to properly use the Kettlebell, you should get this DVD.Rating: 5 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Monadnock Defensive Tactics (MDTS) System)."
5,Shipped quickly. Great product. highly recommend.,Very happy. great service and great product. Gives detailed history as well as clear instructions on how to do exercises and why.
2,Don't buy it comrade!,This video will fall far short of your expectations as it is the technical side of using the kettlebell and does not have much variety.
4,"In Soviet Russia, kettlebell enters you","I am just kidding, of course. But a little Yakov Smirnoff always gets a review going on the right foot, eh comrade?I ordered this video and watched it a couple times. Unfortunately, I do not own any kettlebells, because I find them to be far too brutal, sinister, and anti-American to keep around the house. Further, many of Pavel's techniques simply cannot be replicated with traditional western dumbells. I tried messing around with some milk cartons full of sand, but that was pretty hard work, so in the end I scrapped the whole plan and went out for some Wendy's.I guess it was kind of like history repeating, because in the end the toughest Soviet Superman was bested by hamburgers, blue jeans, and my inability to stick to even the simplest training regimen."
1,Statistics for statisticians,This book will prove USELESS unless you already have a strong grasp of statistics concepts. It is NOT a math book though it claims to be one.
4,Best value............,"I have used these binoculars for nearly two months now, under varying conditions. Mostly for astronomy. I have found them exceptional in clarity, with no distortions or abherrations that I could detect. I have also been using these aboard a boat for searching channel markers and lights...they are absolutely unexcelled used in that function.Although not petite, they are very comfortable and easily held for extended periods , even for my wife who is no weight-lifter.Dollar for dollar I rank these equal to some binoculars I have used that cost twice as much. The case and strap are cheap crap, but that is small payment for the excellence of the instrument itself."
5,Great first binocular,"I bought this product for my husband for star-gazing. It is great for a neophyte astronomer. Well made, good instructions and not too heavy. It is also tripod adaptable, which was important to me when I selected it. I did well! Any movement is significant when dealing with such distances. So, after trying it out, we did immediately buy a celestron tripod and the attachment for a binocular, and now my husband is extremely happy."
5,fantastic but quite large,"I wanted something handheld with high magnification, and especially with a large objective lens for use at nighttime high school football gamees, often in the rain. These are great binoculars, porro prisms, multi-coated, waterproof and at a decent price BUT I found out they are quite large (about 10 inches in length. I then ordered the Skymaster 8x56sCelestron 72022 SkyMaster 8x56 Binocularswhich are about 7.5 inches in length and a little lighter. In comparison I found these easier to handle without giving up that much in magnification or lens diameter so I returned the 9x63s. I'm very happy with the smaller pair. Wish I could say the same about my football team."
4,Great Grab-and-go Stargazing Binos,"I have been using my Celestron 9x63s for over a year now and they are great binoculars. I take them everywhere with me. Very easy to adjust and good eye relief makes them very comfortable and user-friendly. There is a reason Celestron has stuck with this design for so long- it works, and it's economical. No, these won't compare with a top-end set of binoculars, but you won't pay top-end price, either. In my opinion, these are the best bang for the buck, and I've had no issue with collimation on my optics. If I had anything to complain about it would be the low, flat eye-cups, which allow a lot of stray light in from the sides. However, if you wear glasses, this might be an advantage for you. Bottom line, I highly recommend these binoculars!PROS: Quality for the price, Solid feel, large objective lenses. Great entry-level binos.CONS: Eye-cups"
2,"Acceptable optical quality, bad collimation. Too pricy for this quality","The optics used in this binocular is acceptable but the collimation sucks, uncomfortable on you eyes no matter what adjustment you do. Strong construction but obviously ""made in china"" finish. Too expensive for such quality. Not recommended."
1,Beware. This older model's Datalink won't work on a flatscreen monitor,"This older model's Datalink requires a CRT Cathode Ray Tube monitor and it will not work with a LCD flatscreen monitor. Ordered two, returning two. Both missing Owners Manual, and both missing any software CD or website download link."
3,"It IS cute, ... but ...","...there is one tiny design flaw that I wish the manufacturers would have eliminated. For some reason, the designers decided to add their own flavor of humor by adding a flap in the rear that a child can open, and view SpongeBob's briefs. (sigh) Why do they do this?... Stop, already! It adds nothing to the value of the toy."
1,Dont bother,They are cheap and dont really hold hair. These slide out and dont stay in place. Get the metal ones from sally beauty!
3,"WORKS GREAT, BUT POOR QUALITY","I've ordered a few packs of these, and generally like them They hold a good amount of hair, and stay secure. The only problem is that they only last a few months, and then break. The smaller underclip snaps off, and makes the clip useless. Since I've lost about 5 clips this way, I'll probably purchase another kind...kind of a waste of money."
3,stuff I buy,"good hair clip for curiling or treating your hair Holds tight , and love the colors.Just wish more came in a pkg,kat young"
3,Large clips that work well,"I may be a guy, but I have lengthy enough hair that it tends to get in the way when I'm cooking or doing other household chores. The hair clip I'd been using up until now broke recently, so I was looking for something to replace it with, and came across these pelican clips, which work well enough to get the job done.The clip itself is about 4.5 inches long, with the clippable section about 3.25 inches long. They're made of a soft plastic/rubber that allows it some flexibility, and the top half has some ribbing that gives the clip some grip and keeps them in place. However, the spring tension isn't quite as strong as I would have liked, so they don't hold quite as well as I would have hoped."
2,Catches in my hair,"I ended up returning this because the only thing ""soft"" about this product was the rubbery material on the outside. On the inside (grippy part) it has teeth and the hinges kept catching my hair! I have plenty of cheapo clips from local stores that do a way better job of holding my hair without hurting."
4,Soft Touch Sectional Pelican Clips,"I just got my Sectional Pelican Clips, By Soft Touch. I love these there allot easier to Use then the aluminum ones that I had used before. I have Shoulder Length Hair that is very, very thick. I often do Vintage inspired Hair Styles. or if I am Lazy I just Curl them. these Clips do not get caught in my hair, nor does it pull my hair. what is very Nice I like how easy it is to grip my hair. high Quality of the plastic so it helps treat my hair not damage my hair. haven't been able to clean them yet, but I am sure I will be able to clean them easier also!!! Amazon you are amazing thank you again. I am sure I will order from you again. your Shipping and Packaging is always over the top Like always. I for sure will be a return customer... your Shipping is always allot earlier then you say it will be but that's fine I am not complainingxoxo,Sara-"
5,one more thing to consider,"Don't forget, the front is stainless, the sides are white. I don't see it say this anywhere and that doesn't match my kitchen. For me it has to be all stainless. This is an incredible design. I wish they made it the way I need it."
2,This toaster lasted almost exactly a 2 years. 2 Stars for Design only,"I bought this toaster 11/2009 and it went belly up the last week of October 2011. I always had a problem with one side screen not moving to keep the bread straight.I looked it over very well when i first received it. I was very impressed with the design but not the workmanship. Very Poor. Mechanicals are just cheap. I wanted to buy another same design but can't find one. This is a perfect example of a great idea gone wrong when handed to sales.It was built cheaply. What I might expect from China when they design their own toaster for international sales.I never thought the Hamilton Beach replacement I have could get worse, but it is a piece of C**P. Now I'm looking for a replacement for a 3 week old Hamilton Beach toaster that doesn't cook evenly anywhere. Half the filaments do not work. Does anyone make a decent toaster any more. It's such a simple piece of kitchen ware. How do these companies screw up so bad.GREED"
5,T-fal 4 slice toaster,"Great toaster, toasts evenly and has setting for re-heat. It is large but all in all the best toaster I have ever owned."
1,This toaster is going to Good Will,I owned a similar T-Fal in the past and only had good memories of it. But I mostly did the occasional bagel. We bought this one and the family has been nothing but disappointed. Uneven toasting of bread and my daughter must trim her potato bread slices so they fit. She also pointed out how not all the heating elements even kick on. It's real easy to burn one corner of the frozen waffle while not browning the opposite corner.This toaster goes to Good Will as soon as I have time.
5,Classic Series from the BBC,We really enjoyed this series and will be buying series 2 and 3. The acting and direction are taut. The total concept is correct in every detail. It is not for nothing that this series is still going over three decades later. Classic in every detail
4,what a cute toy,I purchased this toy for a 5 yr old niece and it is adorable. My kids fell in love with Scooby as soon as they saw it. It is so cute and huggable and lovable. I can't wait till Christmas day to see my niece's expression when she opens this gift.
3,A Scooby Fanatics Mother,"My son got this as a gift and fell in love with it. He sleeps with Scooby every night, talks to him and has really and truly loved it more than anything else he has ever had. The problem is that the voice box broke after only one month and we have not been able to find out how to get a new one. (I've tried replacing the batteries.) It wasn't due to rough-housing or anything, my son is gentle with him. He loves him anyway but every now and then will say, ""I wish Scooby could still talk""."
5,"A whole lotta, whoa..","These are one of my favorite gifts, for anyone..you always get a great WOW reaction. (of course they hate you later)"
2,title is deceiving,"This book sounds like it would be in depth for people who know the basics of Feng Shui. Unfortunately, it mainly explains concepts without going into depth. Therefore, you cannot practically apply the knowledge to your home or workplace. The geomancy survey section lacks necesary detail and is confusing."
3,"interesting, but goes at too slow of a pace for some....","This is an interesting book, but for anyone coming from some sort of substancial mathematical background, this book may seem a bit slow. In many ways it could be summarized in a 10-20 page paper. However, this book may be useful for those only vaguely familar with calculus and wanting a technical introduction to growth theory."
5,Cool the Menopause heat and sweats!,"I found this product very effective in minimizing the hot flashes, night sweats and thinning tissues."
5,Well written and presented.,Well written and presented. Makes one aspect of the life of Jesus and his fishermen disciples come alive. Worth having in any Christian library or church.
5,I love this set,"I probably own most everything that is available by Glenn Gould on CD. I bought this box set several years ago and have never looks back. I love every minute of it. The acid test of any CD is how long before you tire of it or outgrow it and I can say with this set never. I am well aware of the comments about picking up individual CDs but here there is no hassle and you own a great Bach set played by Gould with very little effort. The set is definitely worth the price. If you like Back, if you like Gould, if you are intelligent or so daft you buy anthing at all, then you will love this set."
4,Good Movie,My grandkids love to watch Kipper and his friends but most of the selections on this DVD we had already seen on other ones. (We have three other besides this one.) It is a good DVD for someone who has not already purchased other Kipper movies. I would recommend it to anyone who has not already seen some of the other DVDs.
1,Problems,The sprocket that I ordered didn't fit my Homelite super EZ even though it's advertised to fit a super ez. However I worked with the supplier and they exchanged the proper sprocket. They were very helpful and prompt.
4,Good Read for Young Boy,"We homeschool using the Charlotte Mason method and my 8 yos is reading this. He says it is good...not as good as some others he's reading, but is interesting."
3,unclear contents,I was really disappointed that the glow sticks were not included with the Night Speeders. The product description was not clear about this. I understand buying refills but description should have stated that the glow sticks were not in package.
1,"""batteries not included""","Product description doesn't say that glow sticks have to purchesed separately, so these aren't glowing shuttlecocks. Also, they're realy tiny. Package doesn't include hints as to where to get the glow sticks. Waste of time & money."
1,Go order glow sticks or be disappointed,"If you are smart enough to look at the product review prior to order, then you can ensure you have a great time with this product. They DO NOT come with the glow sticks which is a must if you buy this product for sunset/night playing. I spent 3 times the amount of money on shipping to get these in time for a holiday event and now I am stuck without the 2nd part of the product to make it work as advertised.The product description does not tell you this part is not included and actually describes the ability to use at night which is not true. The product picture is shown with the glow stick, so I would go as far as to say it is skirting unethical for the add. Easy enough to order with the refills, but they should come with at least one, so you can call the additional pack a 'refill' pack."
1,no night performance,"I love badminton - speedminton is not the same. First off these things FLY - no matter how easy you hit them they fly, so you need lots and lots of space. They might work great at the park or something but I haven't tried playing in a wide open space. Second is the ""Night Speeders"",they don't work. There is barely enough light to do anything with these things. The only good things about them is there is enough light to see them to pick them up once there on the ground. Great idea but it doesn't work. Save your money and play during the day."
1,"nice idea, bad design","i purchased the pro performance speedminton speeders. i have been playing badminton for 30 years and i'm acustomed to the normal amount of swing needed to volly a shuttlecock. these speeders are impossible to play with. if you hit it with a minimal amount of swing, it goes a mile. nice idea to be able to play badminton in the dark, but with these you need a badminton court the size of a football field. (i'm not kidding, the first one is on my two story roof.) i'm going to try and drill some holes in them to lighten them up so you might actually be able to play with them. also the light sticks are very small and are not very bright. if you love badminton as much as i do, save your money and play during the day."
1,"Poor, poor, poor","Very poor product. Purchased as a late Mothers Day gift. Item arrived in a clear tube with no manufacturer markings or instructions. They are smaller than normal birdies and do not at all glow in the dark, even after allowing them to sit in the sun AND sitting them in front of a light for an hour. As instructions did not arrive with the product we guessed at how to ""charge"" them (ie sunlight or bulb light) and neither work. If I had kept the packaging information from Mothers Day I would happily return the item."
1,Missing Glow Stick,This product does not come with the glow stick. They must be bought separately. It is currently just a yellow speeder. This review is solely concerning the sales and not the functionality of the item.
4,Pretty good,"We tried to make our own and failed , these are smaller than normal but work great at night.they are a little heavier and help in wind. I am going to get more in case they break or dog eats them"
4,speedmitten,The Speedmitten Night Speeders are full of bounce and are highly visable in low light conditions. A lot of fun.
5,Land before Time - Magical Discoveries,This Land before Time series is especially attractive for a young imagination. Our 3 year old grandson enjoys each episode and gains a life lesson from each.
5,Great,Great product. Fast delivery. This DVD was an excellent addition to our Time Before Land collection. My 4 year old enjoyed it very much and it made a great Christmas present.
5,Satisfaction,"This has always been a favorite movie theme for me. With this copy, I now have the entire series, my grandchildren are learning serious life lessons from them."
3,A College Band Tries to Go Pop,"Oval Opus is a band well known to Miami University students in Oxford, Ohio. Their fun jams and covers at the Stadium Bar always draw a great crowd. But oxygen feels like a move towards the pop scene and away from the college band scene. Maybe that's what the band is looking for...but I personally prefer their older sounds."
5,A Great CD and Great Group,"Oxygen by Oval Opus is the best. I have seen them live and they put a lot into what they do. They are very talented. I would probably compare them to a Matchbox20/Goo Goo Dolls with a twist.The cd has some great songs including the hit ""What About Tomorrow?""I would buy this cd if you like any of the Top 40 badns out there."
5,giving it all,"Real life lyrics combined with upbeat pop/rock music. Many different influences create a cd with a turn in every song. The Musical talent of the group flows out of every song. Fits every mood: fun, melancholy, crazy, etc. Listen for yourself, Buy It!"
5,Soft and Cuddly!,"My son loves his Sweet Leonardo Lion. It is one of his favorites, mainly because that mane is so soft. I made the mistake of washing and drying his first one in the dryer, which ruined the mane and tail, so I had to buy a new one (the poor boy was heartbroken by my mistake). So, if you must wash the lion, try a spot-wash first, and if it must go in the washer, definitely air dry it."
3,Excellent for begginers and helpfull for advanced people,It is a very good book for the begginer! It can be very helpfull for the advanced in the area!.... It worths it's money.....sure! I reccomend it to all who have to do with bodybuilding! Even to trainers with years of experience! I am also trainer in a Gym....and I will reccomend it to my clients too! .....ofcourse if you make a good search and you want spend this amount of money only one time .....then search to find more books... it prepares you for bodybuilding....but cannot expertise you!
4,WORK OUT FOR JESUS,"Musclemag is an awesome magazine for those interested in fitness or bodybuilding. I think they should think about featuring different fitness models though, instead of always using the same girls. I also feel there should more practical pictures of people who train hard ""naturally"". Great info. though. To all those in the fitness business, it's a tough lifestyle, but staying healthy is worth it,I do it myself with my strength coming from the LORD. Praise the Lord and God Bless!!"
4,"A thorough, though not entirely accurate fitness bible","I enjoy all things bodybuilding, so it was with much interest that I began reading this exhaustive look at the fitness (albeit bodybuilding skewed) world. From history to supplements to profiles to training, it's all here. This is a more up-to-date and thorough examination than the books from Arnold (early 80s) and Weider (late 80s). The only problems that I have with this publication is the occasional innacurrate or balsy statement (such as Anja Schreiner placing second at the Ms. International rather than first, or the type of gains a trainee SHOULD make in the first year). I highly recommend this to all levels of trainees, with the caveat to keep an open mind and consult additional sources."
5,Everything a romance should be,"Just finished this book and I have to say I think it was the perfect romance novel. With a challenging, gorgeous, complex hero and a sweet, sincere if somewhat misguided heroine, Take Me has it all - passion, fun, heartfelt emotion and a dynamite, tear-jerking ending (and trust me, my tears don't jerk easily). Loved it! Good work, Cherry, wherever you are."
5,Wow! Hot hot hot,"Jessie is a strong and sassy heroine who falls for the man she married on a quirk 7 years ago. A wife in name only, she sets out to get her hearts desire from her husband - a baby. What shee does not figure on is falling in love with him.Joshua is used to getting what he wants and he wants Jessie all the time. He sets her up as his mistess, not knowing she is his absent wife, and figures that would get her out of his system so he can move on. Only he does not count on loving Jessie.Truly a wonderfully hot romance by the great Cherry Adair. Although I had a hard time liking Joshua at first, he does end up a changed man. You will cry at a tender Christmas scene where Jessie gives him the Christmas he should have had as a child. Highly recommended!!Reviewed by Miriam van Veen"
4,Scorching as it is moving,"Cherry Adair's maiden entry for Harlequin Blaze is a sensual blast and equally measured in the intensity heartbreaking romance with fairy-tale charm. Seven years ago impoverished waitress Jessie Adams gets a proposal from devastatingly gorgeous business exec Joshua Falcon - but it is a cold unfeeling contract. The awkward Jessie has matured with grace and yearns to have a child of her own, seducing the unsuspecting Joshua only to find herself believing that there is more to the hardened exterior of Joshua. They share their ravaged childhood and Joshua slowly begins to trust but when she conceives - he believes that it is a deception to ensnare him. Cherry Adair stages fiery passionate interludes one after another and tugs our emotions with their personal dilemmas and fragility. It's an exceptional first-rate Harlequin romance that is scorching as it is moving."
4,This is a must read book!,This was a really good book. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys seeing the really uptight millionaire realize that he can overcome anything for love. Cherry Adair has again written a good book.
4,Fun romance!,"I don't think Cherry Adair can write a book that doesn't keep me involved. I just finished Take Me, Cherry's first Harlequin Blaze. Dearly love Jessie (uplifting and inspiring attitude toward life - but sure is fiction!) and although Joshua meets the gorgeous sexiness of all Cherry's men, he isn't one of my favorite of her guys, but I did warm up to him along the way. I do recommend this for a fun romantic read. Lots of humor and ""wish it was me"" time. It may be 10 years old, but it holds up well."
5,One of the great classics of the 50's,"Much like the inimitable Bobby Hutcherson, J.J. Johnson is an overlooked master who plays an under appreciated instrument and gets only a tenth of the recognition Miles and Coltrane have enjoyed over the years. Blue Trombone is one of Johnson's finest recordings, and Roach, Flanagan, and Chambers make up one of the finest rhythm sections around. Not to be missed."
5,Wonderful!!!!,"Ive read most of Mr. Walders books. All of them are beautiful! Ihave to say that this book is one of the best I've ever read. It is well written and expresses so much that anyone can learn from. I think he should write a sequel called""That's You, Tzviki Blue!"""
3,There's a more complete concert from these guys...,"If this show is the one from 1999 at the Sturgis bike rally, doi yourself a favor and get ""Live at Sturgis"" which features the medley and what looks like a much more complete show. These guys are too good in concert to just present part of their live show!"
5,DVD GREAT,I CHOSE THIS BECAUSE 38 IS A KICKASS BAND FROM JACKSONVILLE WHO NEVER SEEMS TO GET THIE MEDIA ATTENTION THAT THE OTHER BANDS DO. I HAVE ANOTHER DVD WHICH I THOUGHT WAS THIS ONE BUT IT WAS DONE AT STURGIS. THAT VIDEO IS KILLER TO. ANYBODY THAT IS A 38 FAN SHOULD GET THAT DVD ALSO. I HAVE HEARD THIS BAND MANY TIMES AND THEY SEEM TO BE AT THEIR BEST. I HOPE THEY WILL ROCK ON FOR MANY A YEAR.
3,Collector's Item,".38 Special live is basically the same concert as the Sturgis DVD, with less songs as the Sturgis DVD. Thought the Live dvd has maybe some diffrent camera angle's, still fun to watch. Sound is pretty tight. If you want to collect every DVD of .38, then add this one to your collection. If you want to hear more songs, then get Sturgis .38 Special DVD. Both Kick a#@"
3,38 Special Live,I thought the album was a bit weak. lots of splash and bluster but not much in the delivery of product.Cheers'
2,mine quit working too,"I had the same problem as the other reviewer, after the first time using it, the scooter quit working and wouldn't go forward. the wheels turn left and right, it just won't move forward at all. The R/C scooter and control are very cheaply made. My daughter is very disappointed."
2,Get the Baby Bratz Scooter Instead,This little scooter won't even move on carpet. The Baby Bratz scooter has bigger wheels and looks as if it would move on carpet w/ no problem.
5,Good Value For The Price,"Well...joggers are picky. I admit I got a lot more sound out of these little guys than I expected. I came back looking for a different type of looped over ear headphones that would not wiggle around. But with all the adjustment options on this product that are never available on the fixed ones I used before...who could resist tinkering?These are actually perfect for the non-fidgety people out there and I am definitely keeping mine.Many for 15.00 - 20.00 were inferior to these by miles. I like the color, although basically invisible on you...will not mess up your hair (!) are a great bass sound, good mid-range, no fuzz. I give these a 5 star on sound, and from a fidgety runner the best advice I can give is: let yourself get used to the wrapped around style first... Then go out and hit the trail!"
2,Ouch!,"Like other reviewers have said, these headphones hurt and are difficult to put on. They fall off easily, too. The metal of the speakers are exposed and really rub against the sensitive skin of the inside of your ear, resulting in discomfort. Whoever tested these over at the Philips plant must've had ears of steel, I swear.The sound quality is lacking as well. The bass reception isn't exactly wonderful.If you're considering these, turn away immediately. There are many other headphones in this price range that are much more comfortable and better-sounding."
3,"Decent quality, Irritating to put on.","While the sound quality on these earbuds is more than satisfactory, they are difficult seat properly on the ear. They look quite cool in the package, but when you're wearing them the headphones look more on the strange side.The bass response could be better, but what's to be expected from tiny little speakers such as the drivers inside these.I reccomend a Sony band-behind-the-head pair. The larger drivers will provide improved bass response, improved sound quality, and the comfort and ease of wear will more than make up for the small increase in price, if any."
5,One of my Top Ten,"I purchased this C.D. after ""Oh Brother..."" spent the whole week of my vacation in the C.D. player of my car. In addition to live versions of some of my favorite songs from ""Oh Brother.."", it has EVEN MORE terrific bluegrass/folk songs from these great artists. Ignore the funny looks that you get when you blast this in your car - you will enjoy remembering ""the good ol' days""."
4,Another Great Neo-Retro Bluegrass Album,"""If you liked O Brother..."" (even if you didn't - ""Brother"" seems to me the worst of the discs spawned from the movie), you'll like this live set from some of the top names of the recent bluegrass revival. With people like Alison Krauss and Gillian Welch, you really can't lose, so go ahead and buy it!"
3,Not enough,I had read an article about the concert and I just rushed to buy the CD without carefully examining the song list. It's a very small selection of the songs from the concert. I would have been much happier with a full recording of the entire concert... even if it were a 2 cd set with a much higher price. Some of the stuff that I really wanted just isn't here. What is here is really good though.
4,"four and a half stars, really","This isn't quite as good as the soundtrack to O Brother Where Art Thou, but that was a really high standard to meet, and this comes very close. In fact, I like the Fairfield Four's version of ""Po Lazarus"" on this better than the version on the first record. John Hartford's version of ""Big Rock Candy Mountain"" here, on the other hand, I don't like nearly as well.But the reason to get this is for the songs that aren't on the other. ""I Want to Sing that Rock and Roll"" is particularly lovely and full of longing, but it's only a nose ahead of the rest of the songs, which are consistently good.I really recommend this wholeheartedly if you liked the ""O Brother"" soundtrack. If you haven't heard that, get them both. If you didn't like it, I just don't know what to do with you."
4,"more of the same, which is very good","Gillian Welch's ""I Wanna Sing That Rock and Roll"" is THE standout track of this very solid collection. In fact, it's probably better than anything on the ""O Brother..."" soundtrack - and that's saying something. This record, unlike ""O Brother..."" was recorded live. The fidelity is good, the performances are passionate and the track selection is dead on. What I especially like is that this record is not simply a live performance of the movie soundtrack. There are new tracks here (like Welch's), which compliment the songs that reprise their appearance from the soundtrack. This group of songs is not a sterile, rote recitation of ""O Brother's"" glory; its a natural progression into the past."
2,Only half a concert,"This is 44 minutes from a 98 minute video. What you don't get includes the Peasall sisters' ""In the Highways"", Hartford's ""Indian War Whoop"", the beautiful, beautiful ""Didn't Leave Nobody But The Baby"" (Harris, Krauss, Welch) and ""Angel Band"", the finale, sung by all the performers, and more. What you get is a pretty fair sampler but if you get the DVD, you will get the show, not just snips. So get the ""O Brother"" DVD and CD and the ""Down From The Mountain"" DVD but not this. There's really not that much overlap between them."
4,Missing tracks,"Nice compilation, but missing two of the best tracks from the film, ""Let's Go Down"" and ""Go to Sleepy Little Baby,"" so it isn't what it purports to be."
4,A bit different,"If you liked the first and second addition, you'll most likely enjoy this one too. Most artists here are well published, but some are real finds. I like 'pitiful' music and if you do, there is a bit here for you. Enjoy"
3,70s folk artist shows how it was done,"This album is worth the money just to hear a great ledgend, John Hartford, sing a song none of us has heard since we were little rug rats sitting in the corn,""The Big Rock Candy Mountain"". The rest of the samples I heard were able to be heard on any ""country"" staion by various artists that are, well, standard.Sometimes you just gotta get a whole album for one song, and this is it. John Hartford shows comtemporary artists what a real folk singer was about - someone who still rode the rails and loved riverboats even if he made money."
1,Disappointment,"I was sadly disappointed with this album. Basically it is a replay of several of the songs from 'Oh, Brother, Where Art Thou?' by different musicians. Maybe if taken by itself it is a stellar event, but in the context of Oh, Brother, it is a very distant second fiddle."
2,Check this out ..,This is a cool movie no doubt.I would have rated it higher -- had I not known that some artists in the movie have never been paid for their performance in it -- hundred of thousands of copies sold -- but zilch has been paid to at least one artist that I personally know.THey were giving this away on PBS -- to those making a donation --he (artist I know of)is ALL over this movie -- but he has yet to be compensated or recognized by the movie producers.
2,The Song I want is not on here,Although this is a pretty good CD I am looking for the song that George Clooney is suppose to be singing in the movie. Can Anyone tell me where to find it?? It's the song that the soggy bottom boys sang in the can. Where can I find it??
5,A great great CD,I bought this album along with O Brother Where Art Thou and in my opinion it's music far exceeds the former. If you love blue grass or good old mountain music you have found a winner. I guarantee you won't be able to sit still on this one.
3,Has potential but I like movie soundtrack better,"I bought this CD mostly because it is a companion album to the movie soundtrack and has songs by many of the same singers. It is a recording of a live concert and that seems to harm the sound quality for me in some way, I'm not really sure why. The song selection is interesting, some of it better than others. I found #8 I want to sing that Rock and Roll, by Gillian Welch and David Rawlings to be a very peculiar one, not at all a country/bluegrass subject yet they managed to give it a very bluegrass flavor. Not a bad album but I prefer the soundtrack album."
1,No Need,"There's really no great need for this book: Anyone who wants to begin reading Bukowski can start with Post Office, or Ham On Rye, or Run With The Hunted. There are decent starting points already in the canon."
2,"a very difficult ""Leap 2"" book","This was very difficult for my 6-year-old to read. Not as much fun as some of the other books. Beware of the leap 2's marked ""Chapter Book."" It requires pointing at each individual word and listening to a somewhat monotone voice. If he could read at this level, he'd probably just pick up a book on his own and read it without the leap pad."
3,Pros and Cons,"My 6 year old is reading at an early third grade level. I got this for her because I heard it was almost all words and I always encourage practicing. She thinks the book is so-so. She likes the story, but she reads it in bed without the help if the leap pad. It is so boring to point to the words and hear it read to you in a voice without emotion. It might be better for my younger daughter who is just learning to read...to see what each word looks and sounds like, but I think it would bore her after a few minutes. as there aren't as many games as the typical leap pad book.Overall, a good story, but boring to have read to you by the leap pad. It all depends on the reading level of your child!"
2,Disappointed in this product,My son and I were very disappointed in this book. There is no way to have the story read to you. You have to touch each individual word. He usually loves everything Scooby but he has not touched this book since the first time.
2,Scooby Doo & the Haunted Castle,"This book is 56 pages long. My son 4yrs, cannot use it at all. There are other leap 2 books that are approprate for him, such as the Monsters Inc book - but this one is WAY over his head. Be cautious about the content/pictures vs words of the leap 2 books - inconsistant."
1,Would have been good,My son was really excited to use this book but very dissapointed when the cartridge did not work. To order a new cartridge is more expensive that the entire book cost.
1,HORRIBLE,This author is clearly trying to make just a quick buck. I bought this book for me girlfriend because she is in the process of opening a child care center. This book is totally useless... DO NOT BUY IT
3,Business wise,The book was really good to put things in perspective of a business view. It had very little to say specifically about childcare but I thought the book was good enough to get some helpful information from it and pass it on to a friend who had nothing to do with childcare.
5,Good taste!,I started to take an interest in super foods and came across Now Foods Goji Juice Blend. The juice tastes so delicious that I am able to drink it without mixing it with juice or water. I have been taking this product for awhile and noticed more alertness and I am less tired throughout the day. The juice has a sweet berry taste and take 2 tablespoons in the mornings. I highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a great tasting Goji juice.
3,A Blast From The Past,"I bought this collection by Henry Mancini for my sister because she was an ardent fan of the old TV program, ""Mr. Lucky."" In addition to the TV programs, she loved the accompanying music by Mancini. Personally, the music are not my cup of tea, but admittedly, they can be enjoyable and soothing on the nerves after a frenetic day at work or anykind of busy, unrelaxing day with friends and relatives."
3,WARNING...TAKE NOTE,"Take another look at the picture of this CD. It says ""Tour Edition"", which means many of the songs are recorded live during the tour. If you are looking for songs as played on the radio, you may be dissapointed with this CD set."
2,wake me up.....,"While Mike Sims is technically a great guitar player I found the CD lacking any real emotion, as is often the case with this style of music. Any vocals present could had been expanded to give this release more depth especially with his version of Bob Marley's ""Lively Up Yourself""...good advice but not taken.Overall its a coffee table kinda CD which you would enjoy playing in the background when you just want something that is not intrusive."
4,The Kisuke Hat,"A very cute little purchase for anyone who likes Urahara Kisuke or Bleach in general. My girlfriend's birthday was coming and she is a big fan (as am I), so I bought it and had it shipped to me so I could check it out myself before sending it to her. It's well-made and is fairly accurate - not precisely the same as the hat that Urahara wears, but you can tell who it's supposed to belong to. My only complaint is that it sits a bit tight on the head, but that's not really too much of a problem. Four stars, recommended."
4,It's Aiight.,"I bought this hat to go with my Kisuke cosplay that I'll be wearing to a convention this month. For the most part, this hat is really good. It's made out of a good material and it looks a lot better than the other ones that are super tall. My only issue with it is that where it should be white, it's an off color white. Almost beige, kind of. It really doesn't bother me because I'm not that picky about it, but to other people, the picture shows a white and green hat, not a beige and green hat. I'll upload a picture if I can so that everybody knows what I'm talking about, but other than that, I love it."
4,Laughter in the Walls book review,Recceived it in reasonable time and it was in very good condition so i was pleased with the product and service.
4,an edited version of a great series,"This wonderful series would deserve ten stars if it were presented in its entirety. In these newly issued DVDs, significant parts of John Barton's comments, and also parts of the actors' performances and dialogues, have been edited out. However, if you order the bookPlaying Shakespeare (Performance Books)along with the DVDs, you will have the complete transcript to supplement the missing parts. Highly recommended!"
4,Too Bad..,"Too bad that this version doesn't include the whole of the original.I nearly wore the VHS version out, watching (and learning) over and over, so I was overjoyed to see it released (finally) on DVD. How disappointing to find huge (and worthwhile) portions missing, such as a discussion with Ian McKellen about the ""Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow"" speech.As a professional actor, I found it to be a remarkably inexpensive master class. It's still worth the money, but it would be so much better if it were complete."
3,Good book,This book was good but gets kind monotonous. The hero of the story can't love any one and continues to say that on every page of the story
3,Great Interview Books,"Though listed as the Legion Companion book I think it should have been more aptly named the ""Legion Interview"" book.This book interviews everyone and I do mean everyone which in one way can be one of it's few weaknesses. I might have wanted more indepth interviews of the key Legion players even at the exclusion of some of the minor ones.The other thing I wished for were some non-interview articles about the Legion-time line-missed story opertunities etc. Well maybe in another book."
2,Retro=stale,i was excited to get this product most of the stuff was good but some of this stuff in here was orginal or at least tasted like it been sitting around for some time. over it was neat to see the names from old but to eat most of it was impossable.
3,not as good as his others,"though the chamber was an interesting story, it let readers who were used to his other, higher quality works down."
3,COMPLETLY DIFFERENT FROM ORIGINAL MOVIE!,GOOD STORY LINE. I ASSUME THAT IT FOLLOWS THE ORIGINAL BOOK AND NOT THE PAT BOONE MOVIE. I WILL NOW HAVE TO READ THE BOOK TO FIND OUT.
1,"Awful, simply awful.","I can't believe the positive reviews of this trash. I usually like any books in this genre, but I had trouble just getting through this one. Completely impossible plot devices, and ridiculous strategies and tactics would be ok if they were presented with even a little bit of realistic dialog and situations. Frankly, given the level of Naval and Submarine terminology misuse that permiates this book, I think the back cover is lying about the Author. No one who has served in Submarines (or even served in the Navy) would make these kinds of mistakes. Either DiMercucrio had a ghost-writter do this, or the publisher is lying about his acomplishments. Who are you people who liked this junk?"
2,All you need to know,"I have enjoyed all of DiMercurio's submarine action adventures except this one. All you need to know is that it takes place 15 years in the future,(making it more difficult to suspend disbelief), and the bad guys win. While it may set up a great sequel, I don't believe most people who enjoy this genre want to wait till the next book for the good guys to win and the bad guys to be vanquished."
5,Threat Vector,"I have been a fan of submarine books since I was expelled from school for studying WWII sub tactics instead of math, english, latin, etc. I discovered Michael DiMercurio's books about a year ago and have read each one at least twice. I was immediately captivated by his writing style and the continuity between his novels. He doesn't pull any punches in his storytelling, and rather than just highly recommending THREAT VECTOR, I would suggest you start at the beginning with VOYAGE OF THE DEVILFISH and work your way through all of DiMercurio's books. If you like submarine books with an appropriate amount of high tech stuff and a continuity of characters, you cannot go wrong with any of DiMercurio's novels."
2,Written from an anti-Catholic perspective,"When I was young I used to get Luther and Lucifer confused since the two names were generally spoken in the same tone of voice in the highly Catholic neighborhood where I grew up. I get the sense that Barthes, a German Lutheran, has much the same attitude towards Catholics despite a promising forward. A subtle anti-Catholic prejudice (fueled by a corresponding anti-Lutheran prejudice on the part of his Catholic neighbors) pervades the book which is a largely negative view of the Jesuit order although not quite at the paranoid fantasy level of a Jack Chick publication."
5,Kudos to Jacobson! A triumph from the heartland!,"Building on scholarship of likes of Leopold Cohn, M. R. James, Charles Perrot, Pierre-Maurice Bogaert, D. J. Harrington, and Louis Feldman, Jacobson has crafted a captivating critical commentary, rivaled only by his masterfully reconstructed text and meticulous sourcing. A must-have for fans of The Exagoge of Ezekiel. Pick it up this summer for a pleasant stroll down exegetical lane. Look out Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire...."
5,PSEUDO-PHILOISM AT IT'S FINEST!,THIS BOOK IS ONE OF THE FINEST I'VE EVER READ! THE AUTHOR IS CLEARLY A SCHOLAR OF HIGH CALIBER THAT ONE RARELY FINDS IN TODAY'S WRITINGS ON PHILO. THE RESEARCH WAS IMPECCABLY THOROUGH AND THE CONCLUSIONS ARE SOUND. A MUST-READ FOR ANYONE WHO'S EVER PICKED UP A BIBLE AND WORTH EVERY PENNY OF IT'S HEFTY PRICE-TAG!
5,PSEUDO-FILO-ISM AT IT'S FINEST,THIS WAS ONE OF THE FINEST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ! THE RESEARCH WAS IMPECCABLE AND THE AUTHOR'S CONCLUSIONS ARE SOUND. RARELY DOES ONE FIND A WORK OF SCHOLARSHIP AS INVIGORATING AS THIS ONE. A MUST-READ FOR ANYONE WHO HAS EVER PICKED UP A BIBLE!
4,GREAT BUY! BUT...,"WORKS GREAT, PUTS OUT A LOT OF LIGHT OUR POND LOOKS BEAUTIFUL. WE HAD THE TRANSFORMER BECAUSE WE HAVE EXISTING MALIBU LANDSCAPING LIGHTS. IF YOU DON'T HAVE A TRANSFORMER, YOU NEED TO BUY ONE TO ATTACH THIS LIGHT, IT DOES NOT PLUG INTO A WALL OUTLET. I GAVE IT 4 STARS BECAUSE OF THAT. THEY SHOULD MENTION THAT IN THE DESCRIPTION. IT IS VERY MISLEADING. BUT IF YOU HAVE THE MALIBU TRANSFORMER THEN ITS A BREEZE TO HOOK UP, LESS THAN 5 MINUTES. GREAT LIGHT, GREAT PRICE AND MADE WELL."
1,Waste Of Time And Money,The quality of this dvd is awful and the whole thing is only 15 minutes long. If I could have givin it ZERO stars I would have. ABC should be a shamed of them selfs.
1,Worlds Beyond the Poles,This book is a total waste of money. I bought it because I thought it would quote Admiral Byrd's comments as he flew 1700 miles into the inner earth. No. Giannini does not even mention the inner earth. He says that the earth extends out thousands of miles into what we call outer space. He says all planets are connected by land or water! This in 1959!
4,Working for me,"I spent a couple of months reading various reviews on products and just when I was about to settle on one I'd all of a sudden find one whose overall reviews seemed a bit better. I realized that basically maybe there are different factors that will cause one product to work better for some than others. I agree the bottle you get for the amount you pay (retail) is a bit steep, but I can honestly say I am starting to see a noticeable change and I was pretty self conscious about my lovely dimples ;) If you put it on dry skin you will have to use much more product. I use it on damp skin and it smoothes on nicely. I believe I'd see more improvement or at least at a quicker rate if I used it twice a day consistenly. I use it each morning, but often forget at night. I'll change it to a 5 star if I continue to see imnprovement :)"
4,Only for the Truly Interested,"This book is for those diving in head-first to ATM. If you are looking for a general overview- go somewhere else. If you want the nuts and bolts- you've found the right guide. Needs to be updated, but still a great sourcebook."
4,Very good book for beginner,"If you want to have an overview rather than dig into the details about ATM network, this may be your best choice so far."
4,A great book to continue Italian studies,"This book is great for anyone who already has some working knowledge of Italian and wants to expand their skills. However, I would never recommend this book as a starting place to learn Italian from the ground up. It moves quickly and assumes some knowledge beforehand."
5,Wonderful help for a self-teacher!,"""Italian the Easy Way"" is a great start for new Italian students. It covers a lot of ground, starting from the simplest vocabulary to basic Italian grammar to more complicated thoughts and sentences. The chapters are divided into short segments, with lots of practice sheets. It provides a thorough base for an Italian student, and turns the learning of the language into good clean fun."
2,Italan the Easy Way,"this was a poor choice for the Kindle. the charts are on too many pages. the book is great, but I ended up having to purchase the book itself."
4,Prepared me for a trip to Italy.,Was going to Northern Italy. Decided to take an Italian class at a local college. This was required for the class but none were available in their bookstore. I ordered it from Amamzon.com. It was new for less than $4. Even with S&H it cost 1/3 of what the other students paid. I plan to keep mine for reference.
4,Italian the E-Z way,"The print for the quizzes on the Kindle was so small I could't read it. Unable to make it larger , even though the regular print got large. Since then I have it on my tablet and it is somewhat better. Good review."
5,great necklace for strong women,"this is a very simple, yet beautifully elegant necklace that also shows off your strong side. I bought one for myself, my mother, and all my bridesmaids. So very pleased by the quality"
4,Lovely necklace,"I was so excited to receive this necklace; it came beautifully wrapped (could have given it as a gift without re-wrapping) and exactly as described. The chain is a sturdy, round link, and I've gotten many compliments on the pendant (not very heavy, but it's not very big to begin with). Hangs right below that dip in your collarbone. Clasp is a little hard to manuever (and I don't have issues with any of my other jewelry), which is the only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5."
4,One of the best Cheniers ever.,"This is one of the best performances of Chenier I have ever heard. They simply don't make them like that any more. Corelli is a fiery, poetic and heroic Chenier. Tebaldi is Tebaldi and Matacic makes everything right.I am giving it four stars only because of the ""live"" sound and lack of libretto. Otherwise it would be five.Please note that this recording is sold at much higher prices on other labels. I am not sure that they are in any way better than Opera d'Oro. The sound is quite good on this one."
2,"Funny, but useless.","The lies are obvious and meant for comedy not practicality. IT's not very funny, and NOT what I was expecting. I only paid a dollar for this book so it isn't such a loss but I don't think I will ever finish reading it."
4,Works Well,"I am completely satisfied with this armband. As others have mentioned, this product is great for small arms. It stays in place, and I love that the velcro is all around. I feel like my ipod is very secure, no risk of it getting damaged while I jog. I haven't had any problems with accessing the buttons/dials.The only annoying thing is that it is kinda a pain to get the ipod in and out of the holder. This could be because I have a first generation Nano (although the specs say it works with 1G). Overall, I don't think that is a deal-breaker, at least I know the ipod is in securely. Maybe it will loosen a little with time."
5,Great product,This arm band was just what I was looking for. It stays on securely and is easy to release after a hard workout. Not the easiest to slip the ipod in and out. . . but i purchased it to keep the ipod in and safe.
4,Billy Does It Again,This CD is like every other CD ever recorded by Billy Ray . . . just plain excellent!
5,"""Brother Clyde's- ROCKIN' REVIVAL""","""Brother Clyde's new c.d. ""LATELY"" has had us all in anticipation lately, for it's release today. Brother Clyde had performed at the ROXY in Hollywood on July 29th, it was such an ""AWESOME"" show, Brother Clyde ROCKED the club! The albums first single ""LATELY"" is an INCREDIBLE song, with so much feeling and compassion, in what is going on in the world around us, and hopefully to wake people up, and fight back to make it a better place to be, to extend our hands to those in need of HELP! Something that Billy Ray Cyrus holds so very close to his heart~ It should be something that is very IMPORTANT to everyone, it concerns our well being~ The whole c.d. ""ROCKS!"" like no other...There's something for everyone on this c.d. You will not be dis-appointed with the music from Brother Clyde, it contains songs that are sure to PLEASE your soul~ I LOVE it... After seeing the LIVE performances, I knew I must have this album!"""
5,Simone rocks!,"I have read many biographies and autobiographies of influential and powerful women in history and many were good, but Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter is by far the best written I've come across. Not only is it very thoughtfully expressed, but de Beauvoir has me totally hooked on her writing.So much of what she wrote about in her youth I could relate to: the feelings of being oppressed and pressures to conform to behaviors and beliefs she didn't believe in, wavering emotions of joy and pain in interactions with parents, sibling, and friends, wanting to break away from a suffocating atmosphere, and being her own person on HER terms. Many write of the same things, but she expressed exactly how she felt and thought in such a way that I felt I was right there with her! Few authors have grabbed me in such a feverish manner as to cause me to want to read EVERYTHING they wrote. I'm glad to say she is one of them. Highly recommended!"
5,Justo a la medida,"Lo que necesitaba y por el presupuesto que esperaba. Un flash que soporta el tipo de fotografía que hago, entre el recuerdo familiar y el gusto por experimentar. He ""quemado"" tres rollos y sin problema alguno."
2,"Skip this version, get the original","""Updating"" Divine Intimacy is like updating Dickens or Hawthorne. The original was in no need of revision and is worth five stars. This version feels like a heavy hand has been through it, and it is comparatively hollow.It is still better than a lot of works out there, but why get the knock-off when you can get the original? The one in the black cover published by TAN Books is the real Divine Intimacy."
2,Not the original Work of F. Gabriel,"I recently purchased the kindle edition of this title only to find on closer inspection that it is a highly revised rewrite of Father Gabriels original work. I have read Father Gabriels work most continually on a daily basis since I purchased it over seven years ago. ""Volume 1 through 4"" lack the mystical - Teresian spirituality which Father Gabriel so beautifully penned in the original version. Instead it has been watered down to live up to / comply with Vatican II whos aim (i believe is to reach a wider body - The Church at the expense of the authors original creation. For a spiritual seeker who seeks and has found the original writing - this set is a let down. Also, It would be wonderful to find the Original version available in Kindle format as opposed to a four volume set. This I feel will deliver the original title which is far superior to the four volume purchase at a reasonable price. I returned and Amazon refunded my original purchase."
2,Not what we expected,"We weren't aware that we would need a special hitch (very long) for this item. We tow a travel trailer so, using an very long hitch is not a viable option."
1,unhappy feet,"A disappointment in this product. I thought I had complete confidence in the name but the product spoke clearly. Slippers were dull on the feet, almost like the bottoms were not finished. I find no pleasure in knocking a product but the only thing I liked about these slippers were the color."
1,A Steaming Pile,"This album is horrible. The music of Black Sabbath and Ozzy was NOT meant for female vocals, except for perhaps a few, like Sweet Leaf. But in a stroke of complete stupidity, they chose not to cover that song. Instead they picked the usual line up. All good songs, but songs full of heavy sound and heavy power. Female vocals on acoustic guitars just flattens and waters down the music. Also, every vocalist on this lacked the emotion of the original arrangements. Don't waste any time or money on this, it would be better spent on some other terrible album, like ""Kids Bop"" maybe.I just can't believe some record label was actually so daft as to produce this steaming pile of refuse."
4,Good Start,"Earlier reviewer was partially correct: the best writers here are Wagner and Shrewsbury, but I would include Heath as well. Also, I wouldn't put Shrewsbury above the other two. In fact, probably just below them, but it's close, and it really depends on your taste. Heath has more flair and isn't afraid to take chances with a unique phrase or plot device, Wagner has knack for picking just the right word and his writing flows very smoothly, while Shrews has a more straight-forward, conventional style that he employs with practiced competence. The rest of the volume is (mostly) unremarkable, but I'd say it's worth the money just for these three. Who knows, maybe one, or all, will hit it big and you'll have a nice token of their early work. If you enjoy tradition fantasy, this is for you."
5,A Reference Recording Finally Becomes Available on CD,"In the mid '70s, At Home was one of the select few reference albums played for demonstrationon state of the art audio systems then. There is an open intimacy with the performers that has seldom been equaled. Buy it, listen to Mr. Bojangles, and feel good.Never before available as a CD in the American market, and decades unavailable as an LP."
2,Not the Goodbye you long for,"This version of ""GOODBYE HORSES"" is NOT the stabbingly tragic and pathos-heavy one from Silence of the Lambs nor from Clerks 2: it's a sterile, keyboard-dominated version that proves how crucial production choices and nuance are to making a song great versus bland. Why Psyche so badly gutted such a sublime song is incomprehensible. The Clerks 2 soundtrack is apparently one of the few places to get the better, more mournful version; also, there are some superb live versions of the song on YOU TUBE, with Psyche performing it in clubs. The meaning(s) of the song Psyche explains on their web-site, and their intent matches the power of what most even half-living people feel it to be."
4,Don't buy the CD!,"The CD is a mostly just a copy of the book's web site. It doeshave some additional info, as well as being faster. But, I believe very few people will find even the free web site to of much value, let alone a paid for CD."
4,No poof,+ Works like a charm when you make sure the cart you are going to copy works+ Savegame copy/return works both ways without any problems+ Best tool for those that want to change old battery in their GB/GBC carts- The selector switch on top could have an indicator which side is for the cart and which is for the MMC- Build quality ain't the best in the market
5,very helpfull,"this is perfect for backing up save data, and even better for pokemon games. you can save multiple files with it, and if the internal battery dies on your game, the data will be safe in this!"
4,Saving your saves!,"This game cartridge lets you upload your save files from your Game Boy and Game Boy Color games, which is pretty simple, but in a time where all the batteries that help store those save files in your game cartridges are running out, this is pretty important. This can help you save your game to this memory cartridge, replace the battery on your original cartridge, and dump your save file back like nothing happened."
3,Mega Memory Card -- more useful than fun (obviously),"This thing does what it says it should, for the most part. It's a great way to backup any Game Boy cartridge that has battery-powered ram storage. In my case, I use it to back up saved music (I am a chip musician who composes using Little Sound DJ). There are horror stories all over the place of people losing hours and hours of hard work because they didn't back up, so any kind of helpful backup tool is crucial. It should be noted, however, that, as far as I can tell, this device does NOT work with the original Game Boy Classic (DMG-01) -- the little tab that comes out and usually fits into the cartridge's notch makes it impossible for these to work. Fortunately I also have a GB Color, and it works perfectly fine on that. Also, chip musicians beware: this thing does not store 100 LSDJ saves.. closer to about 4-5. Big difference, yes. But hey, it's cheap enough, it's portable and it's good in a pinch."
3,"Limited, but useful","This item has limitations, but it's useful in its place. I found it very easy to save games that only allow one save (e.g. Pokemon games), but still haven't figured out what to do with games that allow more than one save (Tetris, Super Mario). The lack of an overwrite feature is a little annoying. You have to go back and manually delete earlier saves of the same game, even if you give the file the same name. Small children will probably have difficulty with it, but older children should be OK."
3,Great Pokemon accessory!,"The Mega Memory Card is GREAT for games like Pokemon that save where you are at in the game. Pokemon only allows one person to play the game at a time. With this card, more than one person can have a game going without buying another game."
4,A very reliable device.,"My experience with the Mega Memory Card has been a positive one. It has worked with all the games I have used with it (quite a few, and the interface is simple enough (so simple it actually borders on being minimalistic) for most to figure out. So, it serves its purpose, and it serves it well, as far as I know. Other reviewers have mentioned certain games that this product won't work with, but it seems to work with all of the mainstream games that you may want to back up (Pokemon, Zelda: Link's Awakening, Metroid II, etc.)Overall, I would recommend it to anybody that has been considering getting one, although I'm taking off a star from the final score due to the ""meh"" interface."
3,good and a half,"Very nice Charles Mingus show from around 1972.Mingus' albums were always musically cohesive and conceptual, be it the simple,Oh Yeahor complexThe Black Saint & The Sinner Lady.This concert concentrates on a complex symphonic bop. Some great music here but not among the master's most intense.Bill Cosby is MC: pleasant, but the between song announcements keep this from flowing as most of Mingus' albums do. As the master may have said, this album suffers from Mingus concertous interruptous."
5,nice,saw this live on tv...and trust me mark kerr is a BEAST.where is he now anyway?? but ufc needs 2 release this things on dvd..my vcr broke years ago
5,Great Recipes,Found it in a friend's kitchen and found a lot of great recipes that I have had the opportunity to try and be quite happy with. Quite handy.
5,"Love it, look the pictures","I'm not an expert cook, so I don't feel qualified to comment on the quality of the recipes themselves. But the food tastes great to me, the recipes are simple, and they encourage me to cook with exciting ingredients that I would normally avoid (e.g., what is fennel? Well, tomorrow I'm making the recipe on pg. 100, and I'm really excited about it). By far the best part of the book is the fact that every single recipe has a giant one-page photo of the finished product, and one small photo showing prep work or ingredient selection. This is how _all_ cookbooks should be designed and written. It's so nice."
2,Screw Fitting Instead of Flange,"The construction is good quality like the other Barker Blue Totes, however on this small size they decided to make the 3 inch fitting a screw fitting instead of the typical flange. The opening is also too small to slide a 3"" sewer connector into. That makes it pretty difficult to fill with waste. I'll have to find or make some type of adapter to make it usable."
3,neutral apple,"It has been done before. That sums it up best. There is some passionate playing certainly...but it's Ornette Coleman in the 60s, plus Ornette Coleman with Prime Time in the 70s with just a hint of Dewey Redman-era Keith Jarrett. The only problem is Happy Apple lacks a cogent bassist like Charlie Haden; the bassist is competent but he doesn't pee napalm on the other players like Haden did. If you like the bands mentioned above, you'll think it's a solid set with muscular playing but with very almost no magical moments."
3,Anne Mather,Perhaps it was the hot tropical atmosphere of the Pacific island of Manatoa that caused the sparks to fly between Charlotte Carlisle and Patrick Meredith. But it was only when the island showed its most dangerous side that they really came to understand one another.
2,copier review,"This copier is much slower than expected. It also doesn't copy thicker paper very well. It jams when we try to copy on two sides. It curls after copying the first side, then we have to wait a long time and flatten the paper before we can copy the other side.The quality of the copies are good."
2,"Good printer, serious shortcomings","I have had other Brother printers and they have been great. I hoped for the same and am disappointed. Although this printer was easy to set up, the scanning software was easy to figure out, the print quality is excellent, the printer simply does not print envelopes properly. No matter what I do, the envelope is always creased and bent when it comes out of the printer. I have never had this problem before, even with other brands which have not been as high performing as Brother, so I do not understand how the problem can be so serious. But I would not have bought this printer if I had known it did not have the capacity to print standard sized envelopes!"
4,Good Small Office Printer,"I bought this printer to use in a small office and it works very well. The document feeder is nice to have when you need to copy multiple pages. It will not staple or sort, but those copiers are much more expensive."
5,Most informative book I have ever read!!!,"This book is NOT just another cookbook!!! Not only are there recipes, there are hundreds and hundreds of facts about what foods can help you prevent certain diseases, cancer, etc!! A must have for the beginning health-nut or the master in healthy eating! Always something interesting to learn each time opened!!!! BUY THIS BOOK!!! I know it is kind of pricey! SO WHAT? Doctor's bills cost much more!"
1,Absolutely Awful,"This product does NOT self-level as advertised. The brush marks you leave as you apply this finish are permanent. Real poly dries slower but leaves you with a surface you can be proud of, not ashamed."
1,Not good as a gift,"I found this book is poor quality and an inappropriate gift for a six-year-old boy (who loves stories about ancient China). The paperback format is flimsy. The illustrations are all black and white, and have the quality of a photocopy. And, the text talks about burying laborers alive."
5,"Uri Gellers latest book ""Mind Medicine"" is a fabulous book","Uri Gellers latest book ""Mind Medicine"" is a fabulous book which will transform your whole life. It includes assesment of ancient healing wisdoms, insights into the nature of ill health and also includes healing therapies for the four energy bodies : Physical, mental emotional and spiritual. This book is a must buy for everyone who is interested in the secret of powerful healing."
5,Brilliant,This has to be one of the most facsinating books I have read. Uri has reserched into the book very well
4,But is it music?,"I can see where this album is headed. Maybe decades of similar efforts covering similar ground have taken the edge off it for my ears. Red Krayola always sounds to me like a band that gets just this close to the heart of the issue without really nailing it though. Are they aiming too high, or are they just too high?"
1,So bad it smells,The worst purchase I've made this year on Amazon----horrible---the graphics are stupid as are the sound effects. The music played throughout is even worse -- not Halloween related at all. Save your money!
4,Not the best Rai album that I've heard but still very good!,"I really hoped that this disk would be more than it turned out to be. The significant contributions of the Algerian and Arab cultures have really turned Rai into an amazing and culturally diverse musical catagory.Instead of spending money on this CD (unless you REALLY want it!) I suggest that you try Cheb Mami or Cheb Khaled......don't get me wrong, this CD IS entertaining, just not the best on the market!Recommended with slight reservation."
3,mom kicks butt,"Well, this was not a very good movie, but it had some redeeming qualities. Mom with a pump action shot gun was nothing less than a super hero. I mean she was awesome and when she started blasting away, you almost had to feel sorry for the poor defenseless 6 foot long killer beetles. Then there was the kind of humorous part where every time mom blasted a beetle, its guts splattered all over the cute little blonde spoiled daughter. The little brother was an idiot. Dad was a little on the naive side too. The bad guys tried to act tough but were pretty incompetent. And how did all the lights and the elevator work in this abandoned mine fifty years later? It's a good thing they did because the explorers brought almost no equipment. Huh? Well the bottom line is, this movie is watchable, laughable and not the worst way to kill a couple hours if you like Sci Fi channel caliber movies. I do, so I was okay with it. Man, mom was good with that shotgun!!!"
3,WHEN BEETLES GO BAD,"There is nothing like going into a mine to look for emeralds only to find giant meat eating prehistoric beetles. Now the casting director did a great job in finding kids that could be made up to look like clones of their parents, which would have been great if this movie was about clones.I did have a few questions. What type of shotgun was that which fired 24 times without reloading? What did these giant beetles feed off of when there were no tasty humans around? How is it these beetles tunneled 1,000s of feet underground, but never made it to the surface? Why did the Swiss bad guy have a bad Spanish accent? And couldn't they have at least tied up one of the women?This is an Asylum grade MST fun type of film....or a stinker if you are sober.No f-bombs, sex, or nudity is this made for TV bomb."
3,Conventional wisdom,"This article may speak to you folks. It did not speak to me. It was just some speculations about what the author thought might happen after the death of Arafat. It may be worth reading it to see how close Ross came in trying to predict the future (although he hedged his bets so much that no matter what happened, he probably would have had it covered).I think the article overlooked some rather serious drivers of the conflict, including the United Nations, the ""conventional wisdom"" supplied by much of the Western media, and to some extent even the material taught in schools and colleges all over the world."
5,great and flexible support,I have used a heavy duty and a elastic type work belt for my back problems. This one is just right. I can use it for the gym and use it around the house for my back problem. It is also flexible enough that I can wear it to work under my shirt.
1,Terrible service,"I ordered a weight belt online in a size large. X-large was shipped to me. I have gone back and forth with them through e-mail explaining I would like a label to return it, but they claim a size choice is not listed. How could it not be when there is a drop down menu to choose from? And how do they know what to ship you then? This is what I explained to them and have since not received a reply. The cust. serv. phone number is a waste of time, because it goes to a voice mail and no one ever calls you back. So I now have to pay to return an item I never ordered. I do not recommend this company."
5,Relient K Rocks!!!!,"This CD is a great CD! I listen to it everyday. No matter what it is exactally that I'm feeling there's a song on the CD to match it. Relient K is the greatest group ever. I have all their CD's and they are all great. All of my friends agree that Relient K is really good, and so are their CDs. So go buy them for yourselves, and find out just how great they are!"
5,Relient K Absolutley ROCKS!!,"This is one of the best albums that i have ever heard in all of my meager sixteen years on this planet. everyone that has even heard of Relient K should not only buy this, but the rest of the ablums that they can get their hands on. absolutley."
5,RK ROCKS!,"Relient k's new cd, ""two lefts don't make a right, but three do"" is so cool. if you like christain rock, you'll love this cd! my favorite tracks are, ""Chapstick, chapped lips, and thing like chemistery"" and ""In love with the 80's(pink tux to the prom)"" and ""Mood Rings."" Relient K is a cool band because, it's rock , but they don't swear and they'll never come out with a bad cd. it is simpley 1 of the funniest cds.by:Sara Ransom"
3,"Good, but not great","I have one of the Relient K's other CDs (Anatomy of the Tongue) and have heard some tracks off of their first CD. I really like Relient K and their music; however, this CD was only mediocre. I have started to realize that if you have one Relient K CD, you have them all. The band can't get past one general melody that they only slightly modify in each song. The drums, electric guitar, and base are only changed slightly from song to song, making all of the songs seem to run together with little variance. This CD has a few good tracks on it, but overall, I would have saved the money for something else."
5,Sweet Deal,"If this CD was a food, I'd eat it. It would be delicious. I can't think of a bad song on here. I never get tired of listening to it, unless maybe I stay up for 9 straight days, then I might get tired and fall asleep, but that wouldn't be the CD's fault. Relient K has got to be one of the best bands in the world, and I don't mean just punk bands. They play songs that appeal to people besides just fans of the genre. ""Overthinking"" and ""I Am Understood"" are songs that read my mind. I love that about Relient K. It's like they know exactly what you're thinking."
2,Relient K said Jesus Must Decrease So Mtv can Increase,"Let me first say that i loved their second album. It had great songs both Christian and non. The ratio was about 50/50. This album is basically their bid for Mtv in my oppinion. I had to go through 5 songs to get to one Spiritual Reference and there was maybe three songs total at best that had any bit of Christianity in it. This album sounds awesome musically and lyrically. Prime tuned for Mtv but I'm not sure this is what I want to hear from a Christian Band. Theres a lot of great secular stuff out there to listen to. I listen to Christian Bands to get some God on me and this album got God on my little toe. I saw them live last week luckily they played one or two Christian songs all in all not enough for me to lay down 30 bucks again. I thought these guys were up there with Pillar and Kutless for the new big three that will take over for Third Day, Newsboys, and Audio Adrenaline when they finally lay the guitars down, but I was wrong."
2,way too pop for my taste,"a few of my friends have been trying to get me into relient k- but i was not really interested and a little skeevy on the idea of christian rock (i didnt want someone preaching to me over my stereo) so i never bothered. but alas i saw this album on the sale rack and bought it. but i can't get into it. it is so pop and whiny in places and very middle school and yes, for the record i have gotten into christian rock-(and no, rk doesnt preach) and most of the christian rock i've found is good. but does relient k have any better albums?-less pop would be a plus- b/c this just pass for me as being any type of rock."
2,wow I hate this,"Really destroyed by the terrible lyrics, I'd say. The Pink Tux to the Prom song barely scrapes through regardless with its cool 80's beat though. Mmhmm is a much better album."
1,WHAT!?,"So this is the band everyone is ranting and raveing about huh? My friend got this C.D. and made me listen to it. After ten minutes I was about to puke. There is no talent whatsoever in singing gibberish. None! No, I don't care if they're christian, I still won't listen to them. Heck, I wouldn't listen to them if they were the Pope!"
5,Relient K rocks again...,"I have to admit, as a Christian teen, I find Relient K very refreshing. Their lyrics always stay pure, but they aren't afraid to say what they want. I enjoy the hilarious and witty songs they produce, such as ""Mood Rings"" and ""Gibberish"". Yet they never fail to slide in a serious and smooth track, such as ""Getting Into You"". Who knew Matt T.'s fingers were also at home on the keys of a piano? Overall, I would very highly recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys a Christian pop/punk rock band that can be witty, sarcastic, and hilarious all in only 15 tracks."
5,If You Thought Anatomy Couldn't Be Topped...,"I absolutely LOVE this album. There are so many catchy hooks, I can't put my guitar down while playing this CD. I don't think I ever hit the skip button while listening either. Off the bat, I would say the ""Forward Motion"" caught my ear. I also thought that ""College Kids"" was an excellent punk song. There were also some more mellower punk song like ""Overthinking"" and ""I am Understood?"". ""Chapped Lips..."" is fun to play on the drums. I think also to, the lyrics on this album on pretty intense. Thiessen does a good job of writing on this CD, or course so does Douglas and Hoopes. I just think it is a well crafter album and a GREAT follow up to Anatomy of Tongue in Cheek. Definitely, you need this in your collection!"
5,correction,I know that it was Mr. Hooper's diner on Sesame Street...but I typed Mr. Cooper by mistake!
3,It's alright...,"This album is ok.. i guess it's just not my kinda music. The message they're trying to get across is great but I'd recommend their first two efforts over this any day.. It has one or two strong tracks but i really cant listen to the other ones. The songs have their high points but the choruses are usually boring and tend to make me say ""ahh man when is this gonna end.."". The song writer guy is really clever and the lyrics are pretty good though..It's an alright cd.. purchase it if you're a fan i guess.."
4,Its a Good Cd,Ok. If you want a straight up gospel album this is not for you. Its a good cd with a variety of songs on it. Don't you think that if every single song was about Christianity it would become a tad bit monotonous? Relient K is trying to make music that can reach more than just religous people. Which makes sense because if all they sang about was God than the only people that would listen to it would be Christians. By diversifying their music they can reach a larger group of people. Myself included. I normally don't listen to very much Christian music. I am a Christian but I can't listen to straight worship music. Think about it. If the Beatles would have sang about one thing their whole career would they have been succesful? So overall its a good album. Its no Dark Side of The Moon but its all right.Peace
5,Two Lefts Don't Make A Right... But Three Do!,"Relient K is an incredible Christian punk/rock band that just released their newest CD, Two Left Don't Make A Right... But Three Do! I have found Chap Stick, Chapped Lips, and Things Like Chemistry (song 1) to be hillariously entertaining and fun to jam with in the car! Although all of the songs here are very funny and well-written, the song Trademark (song 7) relates in my life in such a way that I want to listen to it every hour, so I might be reminded of the message it so clearly implies. Anyone who enjoys punk and rock music will enjoy this CD, and anyone who enjoys having fun with words will love this CD and this band! I recommend it to everyone!"
5,Love It!,"I think this is my all-time favorite Relient K CD, and that's saying something, because they're all awesomely great. I think Two Lefts Don't Make a Right...But Three Do, is somewhere between maturity and just plain silliness. The lyrics are fun, yet relatable, which is one of the reasons I think Relient K is so popular. Definitely get this CD, it's SO wonderful."
5,'Two Lefts Don't Make a Right... but 3 do' is a MUST buy CD,"I first heard of Reliant K at my church camp. They had played Pressing on at a dance and I immediately fell in love with their songs. Ever since I was trying to find ONE of their CD's and the other day I was in Target with my best friend and there it was! I had been looking for them for over two YEARS and there it was.Of course I was afraid to buy the CD since I had only heard Pressing on, so I did not have High expectations for it being good then the minute me and my friend get home BAMMM!It was the best CD I had ever heard I immediately had no regrets for buying it. Mood rings and In love with the 80's (pink Tux to the prom) were my favorite songs! I have memorized the words to about 2/3 of them already! my favorite CD by FAR!"
5,This CD ROCKS MY FACE OFF!,"This CD is the coolest in the world!! Its really funny but still totally in touch with God. Its great for worshipping or just rocking your face off...and all my friends love it (so yours prolly will too!!) Even if you have no money, go mow some lawns or somethin and BUY THIS CD!! You won't regret it...promise!!"
4,Not as good as Anatomy...,"i just got two lefts tuesday - i was really excited to get it, and had been waiting for awhile - i loved anatomy of the tongue in cheek - every song on that album is great, practically no filler. while this cd is still great rk, there's more filler, reminiscent of the self-titled album. overall, though, its good, esp. chapstick, jefferson aeroplane, trademark, and lots of others that i just can't remember the names to."
5,One of Relient K's Best,"I don't know whether to rate it better than Mmhmm, but I feel that they both deserve 5 stars either way! I love how they don't have to use religion in everyone of their songs to put meaning to them. ""Mood Rings"" for example is a funny rock song about girls whose ""...emotions get the best of them...""."
4,Creative...,"For any pop-punk fan, its not out of the ordinary to have songs about getting dumped, or trying to get a girl to notice you, stuck in your head. Then you get a record like ""two lefts dont make a right..."", and that all changes. These guys are creative, their songs are original, and the catchy, hooky lyrics are pop punk friendly. Sure not every song on here is perfect, but it's a great, original album, that no pop punk collection is complete without."
3,I expected better,"First of all let me say I love Relient K. I got hooked on to them with their first album, I heard My Girlfriend and totally fell in love. I got their second album and I was very happy with it. The same great sound and lyrics that I was used to. I bought the third album, Two Lefts.., the day it came out and was fully expecting to hear more of the same great stuff from the boys of Relient K. I was sorely dissapointed. I can't exactly put my finger on it but after listening to it the first time through I just felt so let down. The songs just weren't catching me like they did with the first two albums. I made myself listen to it a couple more times and it started to get slightly better the more I listened to it. But all in all I was really dissapointed with this album. I expected better."
3,Too commercial...but good alternative to Blink and others,"I first discovered Relient K at my church's youth group. I soon after purchased their 2nd CD ""the Anatomy of the Tongue in Cheek"" I loved every track on the CD. Later I bought their first (major label) self-titled album I liked it but Anatomy was better. When I heard they were coming out with a new CD I was hopeful but they let me down. This album is much more commercial than the other two discussing more mainstream things Girls(mood rings), Relationships(Hoopes I did it again), and School(College Kids). I've listened to the Cd and after a little while it's not bad but Anatomy is by far their best release. Another thing is I've been to two of their shows and they played the same set of songs. I still Love Relient K and I hope their next project is better!"
