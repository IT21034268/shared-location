5,good stuff,One of the best anime out there. top notch production. looks great in blue-ray on the big flat screen. get it
3,WHY?!?!?!?!?!?!!!?!!,"This really was a fantastic anime. Everything you could look for...except a damn ending! They could have at-least given one more episode to see the showdown, but i guess that would have been too hard..idk...all i know is they sucker you in in the first episode with something your never going to see...wtf...other then having basically no ending it was great"
3,Too rebellious and hostile,"The basic plot is: Princess Amy kidnaps the Marquess because he has neglected his people and she asks for a big ransom to help the people that have been neglected, but the uncle decides not to pay.If you like your heroines very bitter and outspoken, then this book is for you. There is no way you could care for her (Princess Amy), because in the first half of the book she was a shrew, and I could not warm up to this couple when for half a book they were fighting with each other. I could not understand why he liked somebody that treated him so bad. The second half was much better, at least she was not as bitter. Still It was very difficult after such a beginning to care about them. Hopefully in the third book in the trilogy the heroine will be sweeter and more endearing."
1,What Has Happened to Dodd,"In the earlier years, Dodd wrote excellent and mature stories. These last couple years her writing has become adolescent. This was the most silly and immature story. I could not finish reading the book. I'm done with Dodd. She has lost it!"
3,A disappointment - the first (and last) novel I'll read by Dodd,"Maybe its me, but I am sick to death of books in a series. The most interesting point in the novel is the introduction of Prince Rainger, who I secretly wished would end up being the surprise hero of the novel because the real hero, Jermyn, was such a twit. Ms. Dodd concentrated too heavily on raising interest in her next installment of this highly unbelievable trilogy instead of focusing on the story at hand. By the time it was wrapping up, I honestly didn't care if Amy and Jermyn even worked out their differences.And a group of displaced princesses? From some made up kingdom? Puh-leeze!! The story was so contrived and implausible. I am not even interested in reading the first installment of the series, or anything else my Ms. Dodd for that matter."
3,Camp Pendleton,"This book was fairly pleasant, but predictable at every turn. I expected more from this series. It was an okay read, but we will see what the final installment brings us."
4,Better than the First,Dodd definetly picks up speed in the princess series with her 2nd book. Amy is definitely a lot more interesting than her sister!
1,The Barefoot Princess,This was my second Christina Dodd novel. I was extremely disappointed. Don't waste your money.
5,Really sexy book,"I was attracted to this by something I read about the heroine tying up the hero in the basement and not letting him out (what can I say? A little bondage never hurt a hero). Anyway, it was really incredibly sexy -- but funny and sweet too. This is a real winner of a book. I hadn't even read the first one, but it didn't matter. NOw I'm going to buy that one too."
3,...,"I have mixed feelings about this book. From the start, I thought the plot was stupid. But I liked the characters. Or I thought I did. I'd waited so long to read Amy's story, but I found her to be...well, immature. Of course, the attraction and tension was written wonderfully. I went back and forth between loving Amy and getting annoyed by Amy. Then Jermyn got on my nerves with his arrogance. He was also harsh sometimes. But then the whole thing with his uncle got just...boring. It wasn't interesting by the time stuff actually started to happen. It was all pushed to the end. It wasn't a bad book, but it wasn't awesome."
3,Good ideas but heavily biased,"When I was a ninth grader in high school our health teacher made us read this book. I remember things like him telling us drinking milk is like still nursing with our mothers, and the way to beat cancer is by drinking carrot juice. I just recently saw this book again in a waiting room. As I was reading through it he has a very good point, a major element in health is your lifestyle. I agree with this and I think tobacco, alchohol, drugs, overeating, lack of exercise and sleep are major problems in our society. But I get the distinct impression that he already had his preconceived notions and is trying to find the scientific evidence to back it up instead of really looking for the truth. The book is very biased and takes many of these things to an extreme. I know people like this and they make their life trying to live this lifestyle."
2,Probably better books out there,"I got this years ago to learn some Indian cooking and was very disappointed considering the reputation of the monastery and it's guru that it came from. The biggest problem is the amount of servings each recipe is designed for. There was no effort to standardize the recipes to serve 4-6 people or 6-8 people. Many were for 30 people. I tried a handful of recipes and I did like them, in particular the potato curry, yogurt rice, and a Ganesha Chaturthi dish made with channa dal, but the rest of the dishes I remember had too many ingredients. I tried one with tamarind and it came out all wrong. I think it was the tamarind rice, came out sour. Overall, if you're an experienced Indian cook, you may like these recipes to try, but if you're just starting out or are an average cook, you may find it irritating to have to re-size each recipe before making it."
3,Typical atlas book,This book has been around for years..... atlas just changes the cover and repackages it to sell to unsuspecting readers. It has no new information since the last time I read it with a different cover.. The least they should do is indicate that it does or doesn't contain any new information since the last publication.. but the idea is to make money and they only do that if they if your don't know its the same old material.
5,His Best Video,Thsi is Richard Smallwood at his best. I was so excited to get this new video and after watching it I was truly blessed. Vision looked great and they ministered to the soul of the people. Richard Smallwood has truly out done himself this time.
4,Really cool looking fountain pen,"I like the pen a lot, the only learning curve was the medium nib, I have used fine points in the past and was curious to see how the medium works. For the type of note taking and writting I do it does not work well for my purposes, but this is not the fault of the pen. Also like most fountain pens it has to be broke in. I keep this one on my desk and use for meetings, etc. The cross still rides inside my jacket pocket and always goes home. I like this instrument and have purchased one for my daughter the teacher, although with a fine nib. I hope she learns to love them (fountain pens) as much as her Dad does!"
5,One of the best fantasy books I've ever read,"Definately one of the best fantasy series ever. The plot is amazing and every book is phenomenal. I wanted to ask however, if you could please e-mail me and let me know if there are any other trilogies in the Dragonlance series that are written by Margaret Weis, besides the Chronicles and Legends trilogies."
5,This Book Was one of the best that i have ever read,this book(series) was the best i have ever readen in my life....i am an avid dragonlance fan....if there is anyone out there who would like to converse on the tales of Krynn please feel free to e-mail me
5,Great introduction to fantastic ending.,"Exelent,loved every minute of it. Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman make a great team!!"
5,Q. Better Fantasy Series out there? A. Don't do drugs.,"What can the Don say about this book that has not been said before. It's the beggining of an epic. The chance to see all of the future heroes and villans, and heroes who are at heart villans in thier younger days is a pleasure. If you are new to Dragonlance start out with this book and read the rest in chronological order."
3,Fun But Limited,"I first read the Dragonlance Chronicles as a thirteen year old D&D; fan, and as such I enjoyed them hugely. If the reader of this review happens to be a thirteen year old D&D; fan, then go and buy this first Dragonlance book right away, for it will bring you much joy.The Dragonlance books do not hold up to an adult reading all that well, however. The characters are mostly simple (though Tas and Raistlin are always fun), their speech somewhat hokey, and the plotting basic. Nevertheless, I enjoyed this book and will go on to reread the others in the series; they provide an entertaining diversion that requires little of the reader, and that's not a bad thing by any means."
5,the book that almost blinded me,because of this book i now realize how much i enjoy reading. reading the next books just seem to increase the greatness of the first.
4,Memories...,"This book and the whole Chronicles trilogy was my first introduction to fantasy. I remember reading these babies back when I was in elementary school. I must admit that when I came back and read them they weren't quite as good as I remember but I suppose that was inevitable. Fantasy now seems to be more sophisticated, more mature like Kushiel's Dart and other titles. Still, there is a place for simple fantasy. After all, if I want to read stories with people banging I'll pick up a romance novel. On the other hand if I I am in the mood for fantasy then this story and other like it fill the void nicely. Cutting to the chase I would have to say that this is a definite grab for fans of old school fantasy but those of you with a taste for more adult reading will likely want to try George R.R. Martin's Game of thrones with it's fleshed out charcters, intricate storylines(and much, ahem, banging).P.S. Raistlin is one of the coolest charaters of all time."
4,One of my all time favorite trilogies,"I really enjoyed this book as a young adult. The characters are well done and well written. And the world is very interesting. It is staple fantasy, elves, dwarves, dragons ect but its a very engaging book to read. A great series. This would make an incredible TV series or movie with CGI. Be warned DO not buy the Animated movie, it is horrible!"
4,Dragons of Autums Twilight,Dragons of Autums twilight is the first book in the dragon lance seris. It takes place after the catyclsm in the age of despair. My personal favorite charactor in this book is Tanis half-elven. This book has a wide veriety of characters all of which draw you more and more into the story. Even though the many characters keep you from understanding any of them in great detail it is still worth reading.This action packed book is one of the best ever written.
5,Better than I remember,"I read this series back in the late 80's when at that time, the landscape of fantasy novels was relatively barren. Then again in the mid 90's when I first started playing DnD. My last reading, just this month, I found it aged better than I remembered and I thoroughly enjoyed it."
5,Great read!,"First book I bought for my kindle, great read all the way through! Can't wait to start the next one!"
4,.:AWESOME:.,".:simly an awesome book, as the title of my review might suggest:. .:As a fan of fantasy i decided to pick this book up one day, and was facinated by it:. .:it does get slow at some points, and may seem grusome to continue, but the book is very fast paced for most of it and i feel that it was one of the best books that i have ever read:.-encler-"
5,this is the greatest book ever written,"The chronicles and legends trilogy are by far supperior to all other books i've ever read, they have great heroes and villains gods and magic, I can't begin to explain how great this book is if you like fantasy BUY THIS BOOK"
5,Top Notch,This is a classic. One of the greatest books I have ever read. I'm hoping someone is brilliant enough to make a movie on the trilogy.
5,Best book in the World!,"I am only 12 years old, and in my short life I have never read a series of books that have excited me and filled me with fantasy lust. I recommend this book to everyone who reads this review!"
4,ah...sweet memories!,"I first read this trilogy when I was in high-school so many years ago (when TSR still ruled the gaming world) and recently picked up the series again just for the heck of it. Upon cracking open the cover, I was immediately transported back to the world, the characters, and the stories that I loved so much back in the day.Perhaps the writing is sophomoric at times, perhaps the plot is a bit clichéd and the characters can be a tad 2 dement ional-but who cares? It is an enjoyable, easy read that takes you away to a world you wish you could live in.As for comparisons to the Lord of the Rings, I find Tolkien to be too heavy a read at times when I just want to have a light-hearted adventure. If you want hard-core, go read the Rings Trilogy. If you want fun and action, read the ""Dragons of..."" Trilogy."
5,This is the best book,I will make this short and simple. If you like gripping fantasy books this is for you. You wont be able to stop reading!
1,Disappointed,"I will keep this short.In style and use of the English language I would have to call this one of the worst books I've read in years.The characters were intriguing and somewhat endearing but the plot rambled on like a bad road trip. Its simplistic writing kept me wondering if I'd picked the book out of the juvenile section. Compared to the work of Martin or Bakker, which I consider astounding, it is extraordinarily transparent. The punctuation, especially the overuse of of exclamation marks in narrative no less, along with inconsistencies and awkward analogies kept reminding me that I was reading a book rather than being allowed to be carried away by the story.In short, don't waste your time."
1,This book annoyed me.,"Ok so when I first started reading the book I thought all right this is ok. And the book went along and I still thought it was ok good at times but just a decent book. Then I finished the book and I realized something. Nothing had happened really. There was nothing to tell you what the overall plot would be for the triolgy it was just them going from once place to the other. Its like oh there is a ghost we should follow it, yeah because that is such a smart thing to do. This book just annoyed me so much because nothing happend in it. I don't really understand why so many people love this book. This book is average at best and not much else."
1,Terrible writing,"I read almost 200 pages and stopped. This is badly written and poorly crafted. One of the most enjoyable aspects of reading fantasy is learning the ""rules"" of the world that the author is building. But this world doesn't seem to have any rules, so anything can happen at the author's convenience (or laziness). I'd strongly recommend the Butcher series that starts with The Furies of Calderon instead."
4,Not my kind of book but won me over!,"I don't read alot of fantasy but my son said he thought I'd like it. To my surprise I did! It reminded me very much of Tolkien (who I do love). The characters were endearing. The story intersting and well written. To those who may be put off because it is associated with Dungeons and Dragons I say, forget about it. It's a good book - can't wait to read the 2nd volume."
3,Campy but Fun,"I finished the first book of the Dragonlance saga, a book myfriend Evan turned me onto years back. Never got around to it untilrecently. Despite its overt campiness and obvious D&D; campaign structure,the story has a lot of imagination, is a lot of fun, and never getspretentious or bogged down by its own ""world building"" mythos.Though a bit juvenile, after a time the story really grew on me,and so I will give it my second highest recommendation: I'll probably buy the nextin the series!"
2,"Read this to your kids for bedtime, not your own enjoyment.","Admittedly, this series did help quite a bit to bring fantasy fiction into the mainstream. But, that is about all it accomplishes. This series is full of the cockie-cutter stereotypes that most fantasy fiction is founded upon. The authors' grasp of their own details is shaky at best. It is rather obvious that Margret Weis & Tracy Hickman had very little practical knowledge about historically accurate medieval times. The characters sleep in their armor, even in the dead of winter? I must also admit that TSR novels are largely what I was weaned on as a young reader. But, to continue the medaphor, one will find that mother's milk tastes increasingly sour as one ages. Has the milk changed? No. The drinker has only gained a more refined pallatte."
5,"Fantasy at its best, waiting for the movie...","I didn't want any of the books to end, so I read them very slowly. The characters are so colorful and easy to warm up to. If they can't make a movie at least they could make a mini-series... All the elements are there.. comedy, romance, fighting and lots of DRAGONS...... Loved them!!!!"
2,Throwaway,"hmmm... obviously a great number of people enjoyed this book, and I must say that I found it interesting, but good it is not. This book rips great bleeding chunks from 'The Lord of the Rings', whilst making no attempt to conceal the fact. For Hobbits, read Kender, for Riders of Rohan, read Knights of Solamnia, etc, etc. Even the concept of the travelling 'fellowship' is pure plagarism.Each to his own of course, but I strongly suggest that you look elsewhere for truly inspired fantasy (Tolkien, Vance, Moorcock)"
5,cool book,"i read this book a while ago and i thought it was really good. it has everything adventure, action, romance, suspence. my fav. charecters are tas and fizban. i highly recomend it. =]"
3,I Decent Start,"Let me note that I got dragged kicking and screaming to this novel. I recently read the War of Souls trilogy and loved it. I had been putting off reading any Dragonlance novels for years as I assumed they were all schlock. Well, the War of Souls proved that these novels were interesting, well-written, and fun. Based upon my good experience in reading that triology I decided to start at the beginning and see what came before the War of Souls. I just finished DoAT and while i enjoyed it, parts were incredibly slow and I struggled to push myself through it. While I still plan to read the next 2 books in this trilogy I've switched gears for a bit and I've just started Raymond Feist's newest triology, Talon of a Silver Hawk. I think I'll finish that series before heading back to Ansalon."
2,A downhill ride all the way,"It's been a while since I've read these books, but I think I can still safely say that no, this is no J.R.R. Tolkien. What starts off as a potentially exciting beginning gets steadily worse with each passing chapter of each passing book. If you like the idea of sitting in on someone else's Dungeon and Dragons adventures then by all means read this. If you listen carefully you can hear the dice rolling off the table."
1,Crappy book,I was a fan of dragonlance novels without ever reading these books.I am so happy that I read dragonlance other books by Dan Parkinson and Richard Knaak.They brought me into the dragonlance world and showed me how amazing it was.This book.The entire trilogy infact is well.....boring.There is so much that could have been done with it to make it interesting.There is no good writing involved.Everything is rushed through and none of the characters are developed.If you liked other dragonlance books and want to have some trivia in your head read this book.But as a novel by itself it stinks.
5,Outstanding!,"This is the first book in the chronicles series. If you havent read these books you are missing out on a lot. What starts out to be a innocent meeting between friends, turns into a fight for the very life of everyone on Krynn. These friends must face dragons, and various other creatures on their way to save their very lives. But this book is definately a must read. Buy this booK! you will not be disapointed!"
3,Pedestrian and Predictable Prose,"I've read half this book and am having trouble getting through the one-dimensinal narrative. It reads like a B-movie for Dragonmasters. While, as a former D&D fan, it is fun to read almost any tale of fantasy, I have encountered much better. Consider George R. R. Martin or Tad Williams."
5,Good series,I have read the entire series now and thought it was a great series! I will warn any future reader now that if you take up this series you will not be able to put it down!
2,"Good story, rotten edition","I was glad to see the DragonLance Chronicles re-issued in hard cover--they are classics, after all. They are very enjoyable stories (the fact that the world abides by the rules of AD&D is a bit annoying, but once you get past that, it's fine :-).The problem I have with this edition is the abysmal editing job--if indeed any editing occured. You will encounter typos ever few pages, sometimes 2 or 3 on a page, in ALL THREE VOLUMES. It gets very tiresome. Wizards of the Coast seems to not have an editorial staff, as their edition of Salvatore's _Dark Elf_ has the same problem.Please, Wizards of the Coast, hire some editors before you publish books! Weis and Hickman should be outraged that their work was so defaced!"
2,Boring plot!,"I'll make this brief. I loved this book when I was a kid, but I tried to reread it now and it bored me to tears! The plot is meandering and spends so little time focused on events, that the characters are stuck traveling around too much. Little action, stock characters.Try Joel Rosenberg's The Sleeping Dragon, or any of George R.R. Martin's Fire and Ice series. Even R.A. Salvatore. But not this book!"
5,Andrew's book review,"Dragons of Autumn Twilight is an excellent five star adventure book written by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman. It is suitable for mature kids and adults of all ages. I like this book because it really describes the emotions of the characters well and has a beautifully described setting. This book is also the first book in the exciting saga, Dragonlance. It is about Tanis Half-Elven, the main character, who is reunited with his friends, Flint Fireforge and Sturm Brightblade. They have vowed to meet in the next four years only after vanquishing all the evil they could find. But there is a new evil force roaming in the land of Krynn, which is more powerful than any other being they have ever faced before. Will they succeed in their goal of defeating it? You can only find out by reading Dragons of Autumn Twilight! The most exciting part of this book is when Tanis and his friends come face-to-face with Lord Verminnard, the evil force they have tracked for so long!"
2,Disappointing,"I first read the Dragonlance Chronicles when I was a Dungeons and Dragons-playing teenager. Back then I would have said this was an excellent series, but I was looking at it through the biased eyes of a D&D; fan.Twenty years later, I have read them again for purely literary pleasure, and I have to say, these books stink. As others have pointed out, it isn't really the plot, nor the setting that fails, but the writing and the characterization.If you are a fan of cliches and overdramatic dialogue, this series is for you. I write this review to agree with what others have said in complaint of this series. I suspect that those who rated this book 4 or 5 stars have never read Tolkien, M.Z. Bradley, or Tad Williams.If you are a D&D; fan and want some light reading or background to a Dragonlance campaign, then read these books.If you are looking for serious and well-written fantasy, pass over this series."
5,Buddhism for Beginners,"As a beginning practioner, with little time now to look for a personal teacher, I depend on learning from some of the great teachers, by print or audio media. I found Jack Kornfield's teachings, on this audio course, to be insightful, easy to follow, well illustrated with examples and peppered with his delightful sense of humor. I can only hope to meet him some day. I would highly recommend this audio course to anyone interested in Buddhist philosophy and would wish that some of our world leaders would buy a copy as well!"
5,Very Pleased,We purchased Mother Goose Gospel V02 because our previous version got eaten by our VCR and our kids really love mother goose so we decided to purchase another copy.Thanks
1,Cannot Rate This Book,"I have an English version of this book which is fantastic. Because I know people who doesn't speak English, I ordered two (2) of the Spanish versions. Unfortunately, I never received my book. Seller never sent me a tracking number. After more than 20 days waiting for the book, I contacted the seller and got a full refund. I'm giving this book only 1 star, because I didn't get the chance to actually review the Spanish contents and compared them to the English version for accuracy."
5,Irreplaceable..!,"Oh, Nespresso how I love thee...let me count the ways!1) Perfect coffee in 40 seconds flat2) Creamy texture every time3) No mess4) Huge variety of coffee types and strengths5) Decaf tastes great too6) Fun to shop for capsules (get an espresso on the house when you shop)...that's all I can think of for now...Can you tell I love Nespresso?A must for those who appreciate real Italian espresso."
4,NESSPRESSO D90,"More than I expected. The espresso has a great crema on top, the machine is built very well, high quality.In the begining the coffee was kind of lukewarm, after a couple of weeks the machine started to produce perfect hot espresso coffee."
5,"spice 1, jayo felony, and celly cel what more do you need",3 mc's from cali came together and gave us their version of westside connection.
4,Had to have these...,I watched these as a teenager and had to have them - great low budget horror series with a unique idea.
1,"if you actually enjoyed fri13th, then you'll love...","Even as a kid I remember laughing at the UNintentionally funny series. I recall the lame attempts to generate any kind tension or spookiness.... The actors to their credit, gave it their all. Sadly, every episode follows the same formula. No mystery, no changes to characters. No consequences or carryover at all. Of course episodic TV was norm back then.The 'haunted' articles had nothing to do with the Friday 13th movies. So forget about any real horror elements. This series might've worked better as a written anthology... Nah!If you actually enjoyed fri 13th, then you'll love Warehouse 13. Engaging stories. Weird artifacts. Real Actors.Conspiracy. Get this, the characters actually evolve! Thats right folks, real character developement."
3,Missing Ryan,It's just not the same without Ryan Dallion. I still think the overall concept with getting back cursed objects is cool. It is great to have for semihorror buffs.
3,"All the information is together, but . . .","You can also get all of this information from Microsoft's web site. It is convenient to have all of the information in one place, so it may be worth the money.Also, typical of Microsoft documentation, there isn't a lot of detailed information. Instead there are general overviews on concepts with small detours into simple actions. This can be good or bad, but mostly comes off as incredibly dry."
4,"Great, but....","I love the Macross Saga, but I'm wondering if anyone is having the same problem I am having with this disc? When I get to the ""A Rainy Night"" episode, the color fades in and out. First, it will look good with its vibrant colors, then it will turn into a dull grayish tint. This happeneds throughout the rest of the episodes, as well. Aside, from this little color problem, The Macross Saga is great and just incomplete without the ending. I'm just wondering, if the quality of the disc is like this on all of them or not."
3,"It is polished chrome like other ""black ice"" Zippos.","As Zippo, this lighter has the standart Zippo quality. But when you look at all these ""black"" term, you think you will get a black Zippo. But you get a polished chrome Zippo. Wolf would look better on black. I ordered ""Zippo wolf black ice"", ""Zippo lighter black ice"" and ""Zippo lighter zipper black ice"" (from Cheap Humidors). All came in polished chrome. I think it is not the seller but the name ""black"" refers to ""polished chrome"". Strange. The lighter images show black, too. I wanted to buy black color. I rated 3 stars not because of the Zippo quality but because of the shown image color and mentioned name. Beware."
3,"Zippo Lighter Wolf, Black Ice - Disappointed in quality","I haven't owned a Zippo in years. I remembered them being of higher quality than the one I received: Zippo Lighter Wolf, Black Ice.Perhaps it's just me... but with a rather unstable hinge and the thin metal used in the overall package, I don't see this lasting for years to come, as did my Zippos of old.I think it's just the times we live in (I'm from another era, 1940's), and judging from the overall quality of a great many items I've purchased in the past several years; I'm beginning to think I may be of another ""planet."":-)"
4,Great lighter,"It is a great lighter. When lit, the flame reaches good hight. If you like or love wolves, I would highly recommend it to you."
1,Does not come with Lighter Fluid!!!!,"When i bought this i figured i would at least have some lighter fluid and will buy more when needed... When it arrived i tried lighting it and only saw sparks, then saw that it does not come with it... Which is a rip off. The pic is okay quality, although it looks like its a sticker on a shiny lighter... but it looks good over all"
2,Wish For A Better Vehicle For Irene Jacob!,"Bill Pullman never changes. He smirks his way through most roles, and somehow, they give him the chance to get naked with Irene. For this, I envy him! Folks, this is a pedestrian flick, made-for-TV quality at best...But we are partial to Irene, aren't we? And She speaks English, here, so try to rent this with a freebie coupon, and come back to Amazon for a better movie to buy."
3,Too Sweet,"Good malt taste but way too sweet. Chronic drinkers will have big dental expenses.The vendor was very diligent in packing the bottles and there was no breakage, but it is best to buy these drinks in a grocery store if possible."
4,A Little Warmth Goes a Long Way,"Bare Escentual's Warmth IS intense and I have also used it with Mineral Veil or some of the mineral foundation to make it more subtle. I also mix a teeny amount with some of the eye shadows. You can use is with a little bit of water to make a nice lipstick and then add a little gloss. Another tip: I have had some old pressed powders and blushes that I crumble up in an empty BE jar...add a little Warmth and like magic I have a brand new blusher. That's the beauty of Bare Escentuals, you can be creative and make it suit your personal tastes. I love all their products!"
5,great for fair skin tones that don't have pinky undertones,"I have fair skin and use the bare escentuals fair and fairly light foundations (depending on the season). I have more neutral undertones...not cool or warm. I just use a teeny bit of this with my flawless face brush over my cheeks, nose, chin and forehead over my foundation. Looks very natural for me. Not orange like some have said, but that could be either my skin tone or the fact that I only use a tiny bit. This is my go-to product during the summer since I have more of a tendency to burn than tan...it makes me look sun-kissed :)"
2,mislead,"I purchased this book for the hat pattern shown several times on the outside cover and inside the book. It is not in the book. Also, this book is not for kids, it is mainly for toddlers. I have a 3, a 6 and a 10 year old grandchild and most of the patterns only go to 4. I feel this was very misleading."
2,Not for me,"I was so excited when I ordered these earrings (especially since I got them on a 30% off gold box special). But I sent them back promptly after they arrived. Oddly enough, the color was too light-- it made them look like a dirty white diamond, instead of a sparkly champagne color."
4,"Very Pretty, but . . .","These earrings are very pretty, but very tiny. The stones had great color, and the earrings looked well made, but I returned them because of their size."
3,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED!,PLEASE LIST THE SIZE OF THE BOOK PER PAGES.THIS BOOKS IS SUPER SKINNY AND IS DEFINITELY NOT WHAT i EXPECTED!
3,Less than expected.,"The positive is that I received the book very quickly. The only negative is that the book is a small, thin copy as if it is designed more for a teenager then for an adult. I thought this book would be a great addition on my bookshelf at home. Since I prefer a more extensive account about Frederick Douglass' life I will continue to look for a book that suits my preferences."
2,Not terribly readable,"Do yourself a favor and pick up a different edition of this classic work. This one is inexpensive, sure, but not very reader-friendly. The print is small and crammed, and the paper is akin to newsprint. It does not invite you to read it, which is unfortunate: too few people are reading classics these days as it is."
5,"Horrifying, eye-opening, and subversive.","This book was an excellent read. The book is not long, but it has a large degree of thought-provoking thoughts and reflections. Douglass refers to slavery in it's basest form, leaving little to be questioned. His views and thoughts on the matter bring it to life for the reader, exposing the blatant horror of slavery. On a more personal note, I will be very poignant with what I say next. The fact is, Douglass' words made me also question the very nature of government and how it and slavery are so much alike. A subversive read, I would recommend it to everyone."
4,Douglass was really a great writer,"I had to read this for a college history class, but I would have read it for pleasure too. I can certainly why it is a classic. Douglass's story, like all slave narratives, is compelling, and you have to admire him for what he'd been through and what he accomplished in spite of his origins. On top of all that, he was a genuinely gifted writer. The book is clear, concise and thought-provoking. I would recommend this for high school and up. It's short enough to appeal to those with limited attention spans."
4,Summer Reading Program,This book was used in a Middle School Summer Reading Program. The students enjoyed learning about Frederick Douglass and how his life impacted African American culture during that time period. Using this book also developed students ability to understand key elements of writing and author's purpose.
4,Necessary for Traders to Know,"This disk covers an area many traders are ignorant of,,,ECNs and Direct Order Access. Also covered are tips for trading while reading the Level II ticker. Worth what it is selling for."
4,I Believe,"This book is well researched and has the ring of truth without the sensationalism that normally surrounds this subject. I visited the UFO Museum in Roswell recently which is, generally, not a sensationalist place but a museum of the facts surrounding the Roswell Incident. All of the participants were sworn to secrecy, on pain of death, imprisonment or harm to their families, which most maintained. In reading the story of one of the soldiers involved in the incident, on his death bed he presented a copy of this book to his heirs with the handwritten note in it that ""this is what really happened"". Oddly, although the Museum has an extensive library on the subject and all others related to UFOs, they did not have a copy of this book! Read it and you too will be convinced of the government coverup that occurred and that the government has remains of something alien to which the public has never been privy."
1,This isn't Science Fact! This is Science Fiction!,"I read ""The Roswell UFO Crash"" and laughed. I read ""The Truth About The UFO Crash At Roswell"" and laugh even more. How can these two guys actually believe that the government would do something like this?! I am a firm beliver in conspiracies such as the JFK assassination, but I cannot be convinced that little green men have been visiting the Earth and don't even make formal contact. Everything in this book is more paranoid than an episode of ""The X-Files!"" It gets so paranoid to a degree that you notice it's all garbage used to sell books. Let's say that the government is covering up Alien contact, why should they with so many sightings and cases of Alien Abduction? Them covering it up is a waist of time because we already know the truth! Hell, today it would even be more stupid with the degree of paranoia the country has reached! I say read the book, but pretend you're reading an ""X-Files"" novilazation. It's more fun."
3,Clip? yes Security? well....,I sometimes need to get my hiking poles out of the way when doing 4 point hiking or using ropes. These seem to clip fairly tightly to the poles but not as well to something on my backpack or belt. I've decided that a biner or two works as well and is more secure.
5,Perfect gift for new parents,"I've loved the Beatrix Potter books forever, so when my friend (50 years old!) had her first babies...twins, no less....I thought this would be the perfect gift. She told me that it was the best gift she received! These are high quality books and are packaged beautifully."
3,Dark Industrial,"This is not a bad album -- its actually pretty good. The only offputting elements are the poor quality of the vocals, which you do get used to, and some of the songs sound like they could do with a bit more substance.I quite enjoyed ""Sehnsucht"" a lot, its one of the tracks on the album and I even used it in a stop motion project I was working on. ""German Boy"" is awesome and ofcourse the classic ""Der Schwarze Mann"" is worth the price of the album alone!Overall its a very powerful dark industrial album worthy of being added to your collection!"
2,quite a mediocre album by a mediocre band,"This album is an example of how to spoil something that could have been great. This band merges gothic, industrial, techno, EBM, introduces Gregorian chants... but the result is quite poor.Musically, the first names that came to my head when I listen to this cd are 'Wumscut' and 'Die Form' (especially their early stage), and also 'Leather Strip'; The songs are all dark pieces of goth-EBM, with sinister elements, danceable beats, constant changes of rhythm; some even let me hope for something great, such as 'Invitation to Death' or 'Sehnsucht'.However, the voice is horrible, it seems as if he sings from the back of his throat, it doesn't transmit any interesting nuance; I don't say all songs are bad, but almost all are spoiled by that bad way of singing; The cd is not as agressive as Wumpscut, which is not my favourite band anyway, but Terminal Choice is all in all a mediocre band."
4,A Pausanias view of ancient Greece,"This is a very enjoyable DVD which is both travelogue and history. It covers not only Athens, but Delphi, Corinth, Olympia, Sparta, Mycenae and other cities of ancient Greece. The viewer is taken to the modern locations of these ancient places and provided with a wealth of information. The real plus for this video however, is the use of graphical reconstructions for each location or monument mentioned -- and the reconstruction is superimposed on its modern ruin. This is a marvelous way to get a sense of the glory of Greek architecture and a sense of place, especially when only a few ruins remain. You won't get a detailed history of ancient Hellas and some of the pronunciations used are eccentric (e.g., the narrator pronounces Zeus as ""zay oos""), but it's worth adding to your collection."
2,Not a good video to show students,"This movie provides good solid information about Ancient Greece, but is very boring. As a High School History teacher I would not recommend showing it to classes because it will not engage students, it will put them to sleep."
1,Harold Camping has it 100% RIGHT,"This is nothing more than a sad attepmt to hold on to traditional ideas. However the Bible is the LIVING WORD, constantly revealing itself. Can anybody deny that the church is DEAD. The catholic church paid out over $1 BILLION in pedophile claims in Los Angeles alone and tens of BILLIONS worldwide. Meanwhile the episcopal church is ordaining lesbians and gays right and left, as well as making an unqualified person their presiding bishop???"
3,Places of Refuge for Ships: Emerging Environmental Concerns of a Maritime Custom,"One thing that this book shows is that there is mounting precedent for the disregard for the lives and safety of the Mariner over the actual, potential, or percieved threat to a nation's sovereign shores. The book tells of the historical precedent for providing refuge for distressed vessels; force mejeur. Of the nation studies presented, it appears only a few western nations still place a higher value on the lives of those who serve aboard merchant ships. A must have reference for anyone involved in merchant vessel torte."
4,Nice Instrumental Surprise,"I purchased this CD in 2002 while in line at a grocery store. Being at the local market, and given the fact that I had never heard of The Manhattans Strings Orchestra, I had very little expectations. What a wonderful Christmas surprise! I typically prefer vocal pieces with a scattering of instrumental selections yet this entire CD is enjoyable and somewhat relaxing. This isn't grandiose or over-the-top so if you're interested in the full orchestra sound, you're not likely to be pleased with this particular CD. No offense to the performers, but this can either be background Christmas music while you're busy doing something else or calming while you lounge in your favorite chair at the end of the day."
1,When will they stop.......,"Is it me or has gay cinema went downhill,I am so tired of seeing the same movies always about a bisexual or gay guy always a drug addict or always miserable and depressed, wanting that straight man but the straight man always ends up with that woman and the gay guys ends up being depressed, how many times has that story been told.Then they have to throw in a girl to not make the movie to gay because of the homophobic rating companies.I would like to see just only a gay movie that is not based on stereo types or misery,the majority of gay people are not drug addicts.These foreign films have lost there artistic expression.skip this trash and watch querelle,maurice(at least he ends up with a gay man in the end and doesnt get depressed about not having his first fling)boys life the first one,those are great films.these newer gay(slash wanna be foreign must be restricted from telling a real good gay story where the gay man ends up with a happy life,or is not bi-sexual."
2,"Great tunes, poor mixing !!!","The new songs, and the incredible voice are everything one could ask for in this album. How to fix it ?? Let's say that Gary Puckett's audio level is 5, and the band is also a 5. Move his to a 6, their's to a 4 and its fixed. I don't like to strain to hear the words. And, unfortunately, in this album I have to. But that voice !! Still glad I have this album."
2,Over-rated,"I have to say I do not agree with the reviews below. Especially the one that called this CD a potential Grammy winner. Those are strong words (or should at least be) and the reviewer doesn't go into any detail over music other than to say Gary wrote most of the tracks. I disagree about Gary's vocals here. This was recorded sometime after his heyday with the union gap and his voice is nowhere near as good as his former glory. He still works as a live act (I've seen him) and his concerts can be entertaining, but as a singer on record he's not as good as he once was. I don't see how this album could have been a blockbuster hit in the states (it wasn't even one in Europe). In order to get a label to record this new material, Puckett had to throw in two reworks of his biggest 1960s hits in Europe (""Young Girl"" and ""Lady Willpower""). This album has been in budget buckets in European record stores ever since."
5,Awesome look at early Elvis!,"I love anything about the young and rockin Elvis Presley. I am particularly interested in his childhood in Tupelo, teenage years in Memphis, and his first taste of success with Sun records. This DVD should be in your library if you share my interests. This documentary focuses on 1953-1955. If you are a serious Elvis fan, you will want this DVD."
4,Just what I ordered,"I received the book just in time for class and in good condition. There was very little wear and more importantly, no highlighting or markings."
2,Okay book,"First let me just say that I love my Marine Biology class that I had to buy this book for. Now let me get down to it. I am sure there are better books out there if you are interested in the subject (if you have to buy it for class you don't have a choice). This book is sometimes interesting but I have found that at times they just try to put so much information in such a boring way that you just cannot learn it. This was particularly noticeable in chapter 2 about plankton. The book goes over about 10 different plankton species every other page and it is very boring. Other than that, the book is fine but nothing more than average."
2,haha... i WENT to this church.,"i remember when we were recording this (well, i didn't actually play on it) but i remember when these guys were putting it together. ah, memories. Robbie Clark, the Olsen twins, Stacy (a guy), and all the guys from the beach house on Vincent St. we had some good times and Sanctuary served as a great place to start our church going experience. thankfully, i've moved on but this was a fun record to have as a part of our church and lives. if you guys are out there.... let me know. dennis dot alvey @ wellpoint dot com."
1,Disappointing brochure. Contains only basic common sense.,"I was very disappointed with this pamphlet (it is not a paperback book). It contains information, such as look both ways when crossing a street, don't get in fights with others on the street, look behind you when backing up, and take an umbrella in case of rain. The most useful information in this thing is not to drive over glass and other sharp objects or you will get a flat. They also advise not to drive your scooter or wheelchair behind vehicles that are backing up. This ""book"" is a total waste of money!"
5,This was great!,"The closing of the Macross Saga is phenomenal. I have been very impressed, thus far with the three sets. You even get what was released for Robotech II, the Sentinels. If you are an anime fan, Robotech is what started it all."
4,Concerto de Aranjuz,"The playing conducting are good but the technicians have removed squeaks from the guitar strings, however with them they have removed some of the tonal qualities which could therefor be better"
1,nonsense,"The book is filled with nonsense. No professional historian (and I am one) familiar with Columbus thinks he was born anywhere other than in Italy, near Genoa. This has been established as a FACT for many years. There are always those who adore historical fantasies and nothing much can be done to stop them. If a reader wants fantasy, then this is a good book for him or her."
4,"A CD for yesterday, today and forever -","I first heard this CD in 1992 shortly after it was released. It changed my life. The music and spoken word in All genres, including rap, chorale, and solo harmonica - all are woven together in the most professional manner (Mickey Hart - of Grateful Dead fame - is the producer.) Above all, the Personal testimony of prisoners serving life sentences to experiencing liberation behind those bars via the Best of All Words as lived out in the love of Jesus - that is the reason for the staying power of this album. I cannot recommend it highly enough. I've recently written a letter to see if it can be re-released, for there is a large community of prisoners (both inside and Out) who could be touched by these words and the music. Please pray with me that this will be so. (And read I Corinthians 10:13, one of the Spoken Words - it will speak to your own needs, even without the music.)Birgitta Ericsson"
1,Wrist blood pressure monitor,After using this item under various conditions with multiple people I found it to be unreliable and eratic in its readings. I returned it for a refund which was honored in a timely manner.
3,"Hmmm.... this album is good, but........","Overall, a decent album. But, my recommendation would be to buy their latest album first, ""The Haunted Made Me Do It"".....The Haunted's self-titled debut is good, yes...... but it does get very oooolllddd..... the songs tend to sound the same... all very fast, very brutal, etc.... an exception is the masterpiece ""in vain"".... that song is almost worth the price of the album, and were it not for the inclusion of this song, i would've rated this 2 stars..."
5,Crazy!,"The last time i heard an album with this much speed, aggression, and sheer brutal power was when i purchased Reign in Blood. Granted this does not surpass RIB (which is the single greatest thing ever recorded) but it does come close to it. Now if you know anything about metal you'll know that an album that even comes close to Reign in Blood is a mandatory purchase, no questions asked. and The Haunted is certaintly just that"
1,Von Dutch Makeup Bag Purse,"Small, cute, but I have way more makeup than this bag can hold. It's ok, but I wouldn't buy one again."
4,The Product Works as Advertized,"This is a concentrated form of anti-perspirant. It is the strongest aluminum chloride over-the-counter product you can get for troublesome sweating. It comes in two forms: the roll-on and liquid. Both are effective, although the roll-on is easiest to use. This product will dry your skin and shrink your sweat pores. The effect lasts about 3 days, so you only apply it once or twice and it will really last.This is a product that is only for those with troublesome sweating. Repeated (daily) application may result in red irritated skin and perhaps even cracked skin. Just back off a day or so and don't apply the product when the skin is irritated. It is very effective under the arms, but not as effective for sweaty hands and feet, which some people have trouble with.The only other over-the-counter product that works as effectively is Maxim Antiperspirant, which is available on the internet.Jim ""Konedog"" Koenig"
5,"just like life, only funnier!","Mr. Roark hits the nail on the head with this very funny, very real book. Any new Dad will be able to relate to ""Keeping the Baby Alive...' It took me several years to realize that my husband was REALLY proud of himself whenever he took care of the kids - he thought he had done his job well---he had kept them alive until I got home! Buy this book as a gift for any new father - or any father, for that matter!"
5,"Over-read new parent, Humor NEEDED NOW!","I have read half a million books about the process of pregnancy, birth, and the first year recently. It's all such serious stuff.I had my first pregnancy-related hormonal crying jag which occurred the day I received this book for my husband. So I cracked this book open and read about ""Poopies"" and ""Premature Poopulation"". I haven't laughed this hard in years. I also liked the bit about the toy audition for when your home has become overcluttered with gifts from family and friends. Funny and true!Keeping the Baby Alive till Your Wife Gets Home was a fun read and I would recommend it to anyone needing some lightening up."
1,"Definitive Review: So-So For Humor, Total Failure for Facts","This book is a humorous treatment of caring for a baby. That much is clear from the other reviews. What is not clear, though, is that this book does not present facts which are useful in the course of attempting to be funny.Let me be clear: This is a comedy, there is no useful information in this book. I would not recommend this to anyone who actually would like some tips on caring for a baby, but presented in a light-hearted manner. There is an excellent book which I would describe as just that: Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads by Gary Greenberg and Jeannie Hayden.I would not recommend Keeping The Baby Alive to anyone, it's not that funny and it's got zilch for information."
3,OK but not great,"I read this book when my little girl was a few months old. By then, I had figured out 90% of what this book covered. I recommend that if you get it, read it before you have had a baby. If you have already had one, you definitely won't need this book. If you are already a few months along, save some bucks and buy diapers instead. It was good but really overpriced and the comments made were mostly pretty obvious. If you are a dad-to-be then maybe you will get more from this book than I did. It does have a few humourous moments though."
1,Terrible awful garbage wast of time and money don't buy this for the love...,"Amazon won't let you rate something with zero stars but that's what I'd give this book if I could.I had hoped that this book would be humorous and fun to read while also somewhat informative or helpful to a new father. It falls way short on both. There's not a useful piece of information in it and the humor is awful - it's not funny at all.This book is a huge was of time and money. I cannot recommend strongly enough that you DO NOT BUY this piece of garbage. Honestly, I can't believe that something of this quality is even in print. The publisher should be ashamed (as should the author)."
1,Was This Written in 1950?,"My husband and I both dislike this book.I bought it based on the good reviews. I thought it might have some good tips and tricks of the trade written from a man's perspective with a bit of humor. Instead this book seems to be written as if the father only helps care for the baby once and awhile. And, to top it off, the humor falls a bit short.It really does seem as if it was written in another decade. I guess the title should have scared us away, but the good reviews swayed us. In my opinion this is not the book for future dads that plan to be equally involved."
1,Useless New Father Book,"Why do so many of these ""new father"" books assume we men are all a bunch of bumbling, clueless idiots when it comes to childcare? Why are so many of them written like it was 1957 instead of 2007, and that the most we'll have to do with the baby is occasionally changing a diaper or playing peekaboo? This book just plain ticked me off. Like one of the other reviews said, it's mean-spirited, and I'm embarrassed to have bought the thing."
4,Good price,"As effective as all the other, more expensive chlorophyll products I have tried, which is to say minimally effective. If chlorophyll works for you, this is a less expensive way to get it."
4,I have never tried an anti-perspirant before (only ...,"I have never tried an anti-perspirant before (only deodorants) and so I was a little worried about skin reactions, but all was well. I liked the product. It has a good (not overpowering) smell, and my wife likes the smell, too, which is a VERY good thing. One difference between this and other similar products is the scent, which is more like a cologne than a deodorant. If that's what you're looking for, then that would be a significant advantage. I would recommend this product to friends and family."
4,impressive,I found this to be an excellent album. Very melodic. There's much underlying world music along with some beautiful guitar work and songwriting.
3,somewhat disappointing collection,"hopefully, this isn't the best of clark ashton smith's work. this collection of 8 tales is disappointing overall. technically speaking, smith's effortless command of the language and attention to detail is impressive, but plot is often a weak point. what works in his favor is that smith does seem capable of being equally at ease with three categories of imaginative fiction horror, sci-fi, and fantasy. these tales might appeal to fans of h.p. lovecraft, but in truth, while interesting in an eerie, gothic way, smith's work is less intriguing and lacks the depth of that of his famous friend. it seems likely that this isn't really a sample of his best work, but more of a random overview of his output. i haven't given up on smith, yet i'm hoping that smith has other, better tales to justify his reputation as a talented creator of weird fiction.."
5,Viewer's Choice,"The first two seasons provide character background and allow the viewer to gradually develop an affinity for the show's primary characters. By the third season ( episodes don't seem as dark as the first two seasons) the viewer is truly hooked on the show. As personal relationships develop among the characters,the show continues to improve each season, and the collection of Seasons 1-5 is very enjoyable."
1,disorganized and uninformative,"Disorganized and uninformative, this book omits important beer topics and definitions and contains lots of useless and uninteresting trivia."
1,Not a very useful guide,"This book was a real disappointment: the entries are uniformly uninteresting and uninformative; the author clearly doesn't understand the process of brewing in the least. Save your money, this book isn't what it appears to be at all."
1,Microphone doesn't pick up sound,"This headset is horrible, it's not adjustable and doesn't pick up sound. It swivels up and down but ends up 4 inches from your mouth. When I called customer service about adjusting the boom, they weren't even familiar with the working parts of the product.I purchased this item through amazon from Ritzcamera and decided to return or upgrade it the day that it arrived, after 5 calls and 3 weeks I haven't received the promised return authorization code that they promised would arrive within 5 business days. I am never going to buy anything from Ritzcamera again."
2,Looks nice but speakers quit,"I purchased this for my girlfriend. A few months of use (heavy use) the speakers quit, though the mic was fine. She received a replacement easily from the company. However the speakers on the replacement unit just failed. So that's 2 unit's in 6 months, kinda disappointing. I'm replacing it with a Panasonic KX-TCA60. This is what I've been using for a while now. Great sound, simple, and durable. That's a lot for $15."
2,Breaks easily,I bought two. Both broke within a week. If you turn the earphone with moderate pressure the plastic holder casing pops open. It can be closed again but just pops open every usage. Its a product bug at best. Also on one the mic became loose and now flops around. Too bad because the design and sound are not bad. Just bad craftsmanship.
1,Do not buy!!!,"Terrible quality product. Arrived broken. Slimer would not even move, had to take him apart first thing. Do not waste your money on this. Very cheaply made and put together!!!!!After 4 weeks of no play, Slimer is dead as a doornail now.!!!"
2,do not take it out of the box.,"Gave it to my son for Christmas. You could hear the motor over the song, the song only played for about 20 seconds. The stand broke that night, and the wires for the speaker broke by the next night, and this is with him not playing with it, because he was actually afraid to go near it. Dissapointing. Still need to finish rewiring it so it works again."
1,Disappointing,"After paying extra shipping to insure this item was received for a christmas gift, it arrived extremely damaged. Not only was this item not packed properly, the item obviously had been previously damaged. I find it hard to believe that the person who packed and shipped could not see the obvious damage."
4,Missing parts :(,"The product actually works very well. The fit and ease of use is excellent. My issue was that of the two required inserts for the double din installation, one is left and one is right, I got two left and no right hand piece. It is plastic and hidden so I was able to carve the piece to fit. Second, one of the tabs on the trim piece was broken.All in all, its a pretty good choice"
5,Striking Insights from a Modern Catholic Prophet,"Cardinal Ratzinger is cut from a different cloth than those mediocre prelates who are always eager to accommodate the mistakes of modern Western societies. This book is well worth reading because Ratzinger obviously places proclaiming the truth above his personal popularity. In my opinion, his most striking words have to do with the proper role of the bishop: to keep challenging Christians and others, to, as Augustine said, keep them from falling asleep. Ratzinger finds repulsive the mentality of ""don't rock the boat"" that seems to permeate too many dioceses. When church historians look back to the latter part of the 20th century, they will rightly note the pivotal role of Ratzinger in preserving the deposit of faith when so many high-ranking clerics and prominent theologians were so eager to compromise that same deposit of faith."
5,A rare breed: the modest intellectual,"This book can be read in at least two ways: in the interest of understanding Cardinal Ratziner the man, or to understand Ratzinger the theologian. In other words, this is both a personal and intellectual book.Here Seewold succeeds in not only getting to Ratzinger's theological positions, but also the more personal thought processes that were instrumental in the formation of his very important views. This solid interview with one of the Church's most larger-than-life figures shows how little of himself Ratzinger can see in such a discription. That is, the overwhelming modesty of the man is what comes through most strikingly."
5,Riveting. Well written. Partly biographical.,"I couldn't put this one down. Ratzinger is one of the foremost intellectuals in the Church today, and this book lets us see both the man as well as his theology. It's well written and intellectually stimulating. I had to resist the temptation to underline many of his statements; so many had the ring of significant truth. Anyone who ever questioned Ratzinger's sincerity or ever thought him a ""fascist"" or ""panzerkardinal"" should read this book and see just what a complex individual he is. I always liked him before I read this book; now I see him as one of the most pivotal figures in the Church today. Buy this - get another copy for your skeptical friends!"
2,Tough to read,"Very difficult book to read and I couldn't finish it. Extremely intelligent and Godly man, but above me. I didn'tlike the question and answer format."
4,Great gloves!,"These gloves are perfect -- make sure you know your hand size though!! The fingerless option is optimal for lifting and doing work around the house. Really durable, won't have to rebuy ;)"
3,White Lily,"Lily Courtland came to America looking for her brother. She ends up meeting Harte Delaney, the man she's dreamed of all her life. She agrees to help Harte with the war effort. In exchange, he agrees to help her look for her brother. What Lily doesn't know is that her brother is helping the opposition and that Harte is using her to lure her brother into a trap. White Lily has interesting characters and does a good job of preparing the reader for sequels. Lily was a lovely, innocent character, and as the author says, she's hard not to love. I thought Harte was unforgiving and a hypocrite. He wasn't detestable though. Overall, White Lily is a good book."
3,This first book of the white flower triology was the weakest,"but it may be because I read ""white Rose"" first and really enjoyed it. It's a hard act to follow. The white lily story line is about a heroine who is clairvoyant and although it is set in the civil war era and her ""gift"" is used to help the war effort, I don't esp enjoy clairvoyance as a storyline. The hero was wonderful and the writing as always was excellent and in all fairness, the story line got stronger as it went along.. You may enjoy it more than I did but if not, search out ""white Rose"". ."
3,Decent Jam,"This is a decent combination of a some songs you can't help but get jammed up from (""Wild Thing"" and ""Whoomp"") and some dreadful songs that should never have been made (you hearing this George Clinton?). If you want something to work out or clean house too, this passes the grade. But there are better compilations out there ie jock jams."
3,Ehh,"For anyone who saw the first half of season 11, they saw the nonstop intensity of the seniors final moments as well as everybody else. After the Dead and Gone finale, this half (which portrays the new school year to winter break) was just mediocre at best. Anya, Chantay, Holly J, Riley, Sav, and Zane are gone. As well as Wesley (he is in the credits but does not appear ONCE). In their place we have new freshmen with refreshing storylines as well as the addition of Mo to main cast. The Bianca-Drew-Vince case is never shown again as Bianca barely appears -.- Fiona gets a ton of plots but she is way too overused and Imogen has a complete turn in character. Katie does the same. Theres more Eclare nonsense which will appeal to all the fangirls as well as the return of Connor. Marisol and Dave have their time to shine. Basically this half was eh (if you don't LOVE Eclare or Fiona)"
4,PRETTY GOOD,it was pretty good. it came in great shape but I thought it would have more episodes. but other than that it was in great shape.
3,Order up a Size!,"Wish I had known to order up a size and if I had, these would be a great fit. However, I'm keeping them to make myself lose 10 lbs. Liked the fabric and the fit and length...they were just tight. I'm a 14 and I could have taken a 16 to fit so I could breathe~!"
4,"It goes on wet, which I don't like. ...","It goes on wet, which I don't like. But it has a good smell. I've never tried this before but for the price, I may stick to a less expensive brand."
1,Mitchum isn't what it used to be,"A few days ago, after not being able to find Mitchum scented roll on in local stores I bought some Mitchum unscented and I noticed the main ingredient had changed to Aluminum Sesquichlorohydrate 25%. I don't normally read the ingredients, but things are not normal when they stop selling the deodorant I've been buying for more than 20 years. I also noticed that what was left of my regular scented bottle has the new formula as well. I've been getting underarm redness and irritation for more than a year. I hadn't really thought about why this is happening, but now I know. I am now going to also try Secret or Gillette Clinical strength, although I'm sure I won't like the scent as well as Mitchum. Both of those have Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex Gly 20% (Mitchum's former ingredient), and I think that works better than the new ingredient in Mitchum anyway, and the best part is that it won't cause redness and irritation like Mitchum does."
2,I found the Mitchum deodorant to be effective ...,"I found the Mitchum deodorant to be effective but too messy. It was really runny and would run down my side after each application. Also, I like scented deodorants. This is not one that I'd purchase."
3,Get the Panasonic equivalent instead,"The only thing that satisfies me on this purchase is the Leica dot... that I can say that Ive owned a Leica for once in my life.Otherwise, the picture quality is not worth the price (I bought mine Hong Kong two months ago for, equivalent to 780 USD). Try to tinker with white balance, try shade for example, and even with ample light, shots will exhibit noise and aberration. A simple sun reflecting on a calm beach, this camera will meter wrongly.Buy the Panasonic equivalent instead. It still has a 'Leica' label around the lens!Then spend the differemce on say the Olympus shockproof/waterproof for your snorkeling/scuba trips. I discovered just two weeks ago that Olympus has this model. I could have gone with this combination if I knew that Olympus has this early on.Ah that red dot is expensive."
1,where are the track listings?,"I might have bought this pdt. EXCEPT there are NO TRACK LISTINGS, therefore no way to know what songs would be listed. If SERIOUS about making sale, i suggest SELLERS ALWAYS INCLUDE info. about pdt. such as: condition, shipping info., PRICE, & TRACK LISTINGS!!!!!"
5,sandals,"Great and super comfortable pair of sandals. Feels like I am walking on air. Very pleasantly surprised at the low price. Bought two, different colors."
5,An Excellent Book,"If you have the Lego RIS and are interested in Java then this is the book to get. Bagnall leads you through the installation of LEJOS and JCreator (both freeware) including setting up the environment variables on your PC. He also gives a brief introduction to Java, enough to get you started. The chapters on behavior, proximity detection and navigation are especially good. As an added bonus, applying the techniques discussed in this book is a fun way of learning the basic concepts of Java and object oriented programming. It won't make you an expert, but it will get you started."
2,"Excellent for RCX, not so good for NXT","I bought this book to teach students to program their NXTs using Java as the next level above NXT-G. As I began using the book, I came to realize that many examples and explanations were written for the RCX. The few that existed for the NXT did not seem to work or were not as well explained. I am still using the book for ideas but this book is not helping me as much as I expected."
3,SWE member,"Contents includes:interfacing a robot to a PCelectronics schematics : light, touch. motion sensors, distance, compass sensorsRobot magazine cost $5.99 and includes non JAVA educational robots"
4,A compelling tale of one of the best pair skating teams,"The story which gives both points of view from Isabelle and Lloyd is heartfelt. Both tell of how they met and how their relationship has grown from over the years from simply a pairs skating ensemble to best friends. ""Herbie"" and ""Freddy"", as is their nicknames for each other, have written a book together that will always be named one of my favorites. Honesty is evident in the book, when they tell of their competition days, from Lloyd throwing chairs to more personal trivial tales of Isabelle throwing erasers. They do not hold back with their emotions in the book being brutally honest at times. Included in the book are tales of inside skating pranks and accidents from the days of touring. Personal triumph is also quite evident in the book when Isabelle speaks of the death of her father to Lloyd's transformation from the ""bull in the chain shop"" to the skater who feels the music, loud and soft. Compelling and captivating"
1,I am furious,"I bought this game because I own the original and loved it. I loaded this game and it wasn't set up like the old one and the score didn't accumulate. I unfortantely saw that they had a trial for the old game, thinking that maybe they added more to the old one I tried it. BIG MISTAKE!!! After that I could not get to my original game it would only bring up the trial game. I figured after the trial minutes were up I would get back my game which I have had for years. NOPE! Every time Itried it said that I have to pay $19.95 to buy the game. I would not recommend this game to anyone."
5,Fabulous!,"That's how a carnival grows, my son! I am terrified of clowns, but I cannot pull my eyes from the screen when I watch this movie. The storylines, the amazing music, the creativity of the writers, costumers & wonderful actors all make this a wonderful experience from beginning to end. I've watched it over & over again from the moment my Ringmaster Edition arrived. I cannot wait for the next episode!"
3,im gonna get crap for this...,"i love Darren. his work is amazing. saw II-IV, and ofcorse my favorite production of his, Repo! the Genetic Opera. seriously one of my all time favorites... but The devils Carnival. being so excited for this for so long, i was a bit let down... great cast, great music, great makeup, but as a movie it kinda blew... i am willing to see the sequel when it comes out but i am so let down by this one. cmmon Darren, this and 11-11-11 were kinda annoying. maybe if you spent a lil more time fighting for repo to have a sequel that it so much deserves instead of losing the rights i would be writing a different review for repo 2 instead of this unfortunate negative spit for TDC..."
4,Saw them on their road tour,"I figured I would purchase it. If you are expecting Repo!, turn back now. It's different. Be open to change :)"
5,A Must Read!,"This is a ""must read"" not only for anyone in the healthcare industry, but anyone in the leadership, organizational development, or behavioral science fields. Fascinating story - attention grabbing! There are many lessons to be learned!"
5,"Intriguing story, Facinating concept","This is an incredibly insightful book dealing with board disfunctions in a healthcare institution which lead to the increased probability of malpractice at the rank & file level.In addition to being a fun read, there are many useful insights to be gleaned from this story. A must read for healthcare professionals at the board & senior management level. A good novel for anyone."
5,A very neat culinary book,"I simply love this book. My native language is not English, but I could read it and understand very easily. Also, it's full of unforgettable insights which I like the best. So I would recommend this book to people like me - not very fluent in English, but eager to learn how to cook properly."
4,I LOVE THIS CD!!!!,"This is gospel music at its best. Mr. Stosic displays a range in gospelness that is years ahead of his time. Not only is the music rich and filling, but the lyrics are as insightful and fill me a warm sense of well-being."
3,minimal treatment,"i'm a real fan of godflesh so i had to buy this. the price is hard to justify considering the number of clips and the poor quality, though. i have also noticed that this is very grainy, and if that's a product of the transfer rather than being intentional, then that's just plain lax on earache's part. i have an old tape of slavestate (taken off tv here in australia) and that isn't any more grainy than this DVD version, and may even be less soStill, it's godflesh. 5 stars for the music."
2,"Poor fitment, finish is slightly off from stock dash","There are not many options for dash kits for single DIN radios for the 04-09 Mazda 3. The fitment of this kit is very poor, as there are gaps on the top, bottom, and the curved top is not at the same arc/angle as the side dash pieces. The top trim pocket also does not fit well either.I am going to order another kit, made by Scosche and see if it is any better.Scosche Ma1536B Installation Kit For 2005 and Up Mazda 3"
4,Dash Kit for Mazda 3,"I have been very pleased with my installation kit for a Mazda 3. It was much less expensive than getting it from Best Buy. It works well, and I'm very happy with it."
1,Terrible DVD,"This is a terrible DVD!! I barely sweat during the entire workout! He goes from explaining things painfully slowly to doing repetitive combination at an unrealistic pace. Plus he talks during the whole video and all the people count out loud, so annoying. As if that's not enough his blonde sidekick is uber irritating. I may reconsider doing the video again if it weren't for her, she just miserable!"
5,awesome cardio!!!,"I find this workout very helpfu!!! I love it!!! I recommend it. If you haven't been workingout for a while this is a good video. I have his boot camp elite set which I did back in 2006 after having my first daughter, now after 2 more babies a 2yr old and a 1yr old I'm back to Billy's Cardio Inferno... It's awesome you will sweat... Love how he motivates you to keep going. Whoever purchase this I hope you enjoy it as much as I am now :)"
2,"Too much Talking, not enough action","I'm training for my 3rd marathon and figured I'd do some cardio on my off days of running. I bought this item thinking it would give me a good workout but was so diappointed. There is way too much instruction inbetween activity, and the activity wasn't long enough, it felt like we should go another 5 rounds of each excercise. There was too much standing around, and I was getting so frustrated that I was doing my own kickboxing while he yapped about things. It would have been helpful to have some motivating music along with the workout as well. All in all, I would not recommend this particular dvd as a form of a true cardio."
4,Good TaeBo to add to the mix,"As with many other TaeBo enthusiasts I've got to say Advanced is still my favorite, but seeing as it's apparently never coming to DVD I'll have to deal. I bought this DVD hesitantly because of the mixed reviews but wanted to add a new Tae Bo to the rotation because you can only do the same routine so many times before it gets old so now I switch it up between this, TaeBo Amped, TaeBo bootcamp, and yoga. It gives you a great cardio workout. I'm not sure those who wrote reviews about not sweating or it being too slow were watching this workout cause I definitely couldn't make it through it the first time and I've been doing TaeBo on and off for years now!! Buy it! For less than $10 you won't be disappointed!!!!"
4,I digress...its a good supplemental workout,"Update: This workout is better than I'd orginally thought. I decided to give a try (1st time I just watched). I give it to Billy, for a 55 year old he's still moving great. I think that if you are an avid Tae Bo person, we are constantly looking for his workouts to be better than the last. But I had to realize that Get Ripped series came out over a decade ago with a much younger Billy. The man is almost 60 years old, so I doubt that he will ever be able to bring it like he did when Tae Bo first came out. With that being said, I think this workout is a good supplement to another regimine or a routine, such as Ab Bootcamp or Lower Body Bootcamp.. I doubt it burns 800 calories, nor does it last a full 60 mins but over all I felt the effects. If you are looking for a similar workout with a little more of a challenge, try the Celebrity Get Fit Series, which has more of the same move sequences at a faster pace."
2,Disappointed,"I was severely disappointed with this ""cardio"" workout. After having done Billy Blanks TaeBo for years, I was hoping to mix it up. This workout is hardly a cardio workout! I burn more calories walking for 30 minutes than I did doing this workout. If you are looking for a good cardio workout, I highly recommend his Advanced TaeBo DVD's from the 90s!! They are an extremely good workout (if you can overlook the ridiculous outfits)."
3,blow you away,"Way to much for me, I guess I was really out of shape. I thought being in my weight guide for weight watchers, and doing the treadmill daily for 2 years, and other tapes I thought it would be fun and different. I will keep trying to do it, I will not give up. It is a work out."
4,Good workout,"This workout video is pretty good for Billy and his team. This is a little different than the other videos they have put out, but one that will give you a good sweat. However, I am still looking for one that he keeps you moving throughout the whole video."
3,Not as intense as I had hoped,"I have been doing Tae Bo and other kick-boxing exercises for a number of years on and off, and have been looking to get a little more variety. I have the Amped set, which is good if you are looking to target specific areas. I also have the original box set - the advanced workout is still one of my favorites. I saw that this one said ""non-stop cardio"" and ""the best cardio workout to ever hit the market"" and decided to try it. It's one of the least intense workouts I've ever done. There are long breaks in between every set and he doesn't push enough during the sets. I barely worked up a sweat at all, and am extremely disappointed with how this was advertised. I was also disappointed with the length of the workout; it says it's an hour long workout - it's not. It should be labeled as it is - a beginner to intermediate workout."
3,Not Challenge,"This DVD is not really challenging. Perhaps, it is good for new beginner. I better stick to originals Taebo Live."
2,Not high intensity enough,"I'm sorry, I'd love to be able to say this was a great workout that pushed me to the max but it just didn't. This is more like the workout I do on the days when don't feel like working out. Billy spends way too much time talking and explaining each move despite the fact that the dvd has a tutorial on it which only covers the most basic of the moves in the workout. Meanwhile you're expected to walk or jog in place to keep your heart rate up which just barely does the job. He has tons of complicated combinations but he never does any of them long enough for you to get the rhythm of them or actually feel any burn.The yoga like cool down section is way to fast and all over the place to be effective.Overall, I think Mr. Blanks was just half-assing his way through this workout just to have something new to put out there to the public and you'd be better off doing one of bob, jillian or jackie's videos for a really good workout."
2,Not so great,"I did not like this video at all. I've done just about all of Jillian Michaels videos, and tend to really like hers, but wanted to switch things up and get back into more kickboxing type moves. But man this video was such a snooze! I'm 29, in pretty good shape, and work out about 5 times a week. I'm a big video buff because I live in Boston and we've had a brutal winter so I can't run outside. I was so hopeful for this video, but wish I'd read the reviews before buying. It was really slow, and the breaks in between workouts were long enough to go make a sandwich! The only thing I'll give it, is that there were a couple of times where my arms or legs burned a little. But I never really broke a sweat or got breathless. I swear the must spray the people in this video with water bottles because there's no way they are sweating that much. I'd choose the biggest Loser Cardio Max over this video"
3,It's Ok.,"I am a huge fan of Billy Blanks and have plenty of his DVDs. What sold me on this DVD was that it said that it burned nearly 800 calories and had some great new moves. 800 calories....really? where? I did the workout for 40 mins and really wasn't even sweating. I definitely agree w/ some of the other folks, I feel that it's more of a beginner, maybe intermediate workout. Just didn't feel as pushed or excited as his previous dvds. I guess I'll stay w/ his boot camp series and previous tae bo workouts for a change up."
4,Decent workout but not as intense as I thought it would be.,"""cardio inferno"" is a little misleading; this is actually now one of the easier workouts I have in my rotation that I do when I want a little less intense workout. He takes too many breaks to keep the heart rate consistenly up. It's still classic Billy Blanks but like I said, easier than the other Billy Blanks TaeBo workouts I have. ( recommend his Ultimate TaeBo dvd- much more intensity)"
5,it really works!,"This is a great work out!This has just the right kind of intensity and burn that you need. It's only about 50 minutes if you do it 'til the first cooling down, not too long like the other exercises out there. My husband noticed a difference in me in just 4 days...odd but true. I would do like 4 days a week and I felt a big difference in my hips,thighs and arms in just 3 weeks! But take note, that's not even doing it 7 days a week! I love this and I plan to stick to this program and alternate it with walking/running and maybe tennis."
1,Won't run on modern software,I was looking forward to getting this product so that I could advance in my technique under a reputable method. Unfortunately I'll never know what this product is like since it runs under Windows 95 and nothing later. I don't even have an old PC laying around the house that runs on this version so it had to go back to the seller. At least the vender honored the guarantee. I'm disappointed that they never mentioned this in the advertizement for it. It could have saved me a lot of disappointment. The company G-VOX doesn't even support it anymore; so I'd avoid buying it unless you have windows 95 and don't care about support.
3,Action/Better Days,"I'm not a big fan of the Blackbyrds to begin with. I recently met a former member of the group and he convinced me to give them a listen. He tried to convince me that they were similar to Earth, Wind and Fire, who I am a big fan of. Well they are not close to Earth, Wind and Fire. I'm not impressed at all with the writers of their music. I think I will just have to stick to their singles.Pbocruz"
4,The Ultimate Montana Atlas and Travel Encyclopedia,"This is an excellent resource if you are planning a trip to Montana. A huge amount of information is covered. Also, I bought it directly from Mr. Dougherty and he goes far beyond the call of duty making sure you are satisfied, as well as asking for specific critiques. I am entirely happy with my purchase, but gave it four rather than five stars because referencing recommendations back to individual maps is a bit tedious. I'd highly recommend buying Off The Beaten Path: Montana by Michael McCoy in addition to ""The Ultimate."" Both books together and you'll know more about this wonderful state than the Gov."
2,Not what I expected,"I was looking for a book to help with an upcoming trip to Glacier National Park area, but this one didn't fit the bill. While I wanted suggestions for things to do, day trip recommendations, trail information, etc., this book is more like a ""yellow pages"" of Montana. Want to know about motels? It's here. Want to plan activities? Probably not the right book. It's all black and white, very large (too large to pack), maps are scarce. I'm going to look for a different option."
2,Just another Yellow Pages,"I was disappointed with this book. The listings for the different areas of the state are not complete. It appears that only those attactions and hotels that were willing to pay the publisher were included. Discriptions include only what the hotel or attraction was willing to provide. It is not a travel review book, it's a yellow pages you get to pay for."
5,A Must have book!!!!,We love to go to Montana and in looking for a guide that wasn't run of the mill...blah...blah...blah I came across this one. At first I thought the [...]price was a little steep but I read the reviews for it and thought why not.I only had time to glance through the book before we left on vacation. But riding in the car I could really digest my purchase. I read ahead before we came to each area we wanted to see. I read it aloud to my husband in case I missed anything that he might like to see also.The book is wonderful. It gives you everything you may want to know and then some. So many books touch mainly on tourist trap destinations. This book touches on all of it...off the beaten path type places along with everything in between.We love Montana and we learned so much that we didn't know. There is alot of history meshed together with the do and see parts.This book is worth every penny. Don't just think about ordering a copy....get one!!! Ten Stars!!!!
2,"A case for your camera, but nothing more","I asked for this as a Christmas gift, but didn't recieve it until late February due to a backlog in inventory. I was very disappointed, as it is only big enough to fit the camera, with very little in the way of storage. It fits so snug, it actually takes some effort to take the camera out of the case. There's not that much in the way of padding either. There is a small pouch at the top; enough for some extra batteries or memory card. I didn't expect it to have lots of extra storage, but thought there would be more pockets in front or inside. As I was waiting for it to arrive, I purchased a larger camera case for a third of the price and that one meets my needs much better. If you plan to carry anything else other than the camera, go to a camera store and bring your camera. This way you can get a case that's the right size for your needs."
1,Unavailable,"I'm trying to buy this item, which would be available soon, since November/December of 2004, when I bought the S7000. So, if it doesn't exist its not possible to rate it."
5,The Verve's best B-side sandwhiched between two classics.,"Is this single worth buying for one new song? Yes it is, ""Never Wanna See You Cry"" is of the b-sides I've heard of The Verve, thier best. The lyrics are similar to ""The Drugs Don't Work"" and the music has the classic string arrangment sound that The Verve established on ""Urban Hymns"". I don't think I need to discuss, ""Lucky Man"" and ""History"". If you haven't heard them then you need to catch up. This single could be the best proof of The Verve's brilliance."
1,Talk about mislabelling!,"OK so the title says 'Music of the Texas Mexican Borderlands', well what you get very little of on this DVD is music ... what you get A LOT OF is TV news stories of seedy little Mexcian towns and Mexicans trying to get over the border to Texas ...I mean even if I downed 10 Tequila Sunrises while watching this DVD the music that they did tape on this DVD is bad ... poorly performed .. badly taped ...The picture on the front of this DVD should have been shots of the US border patrol taking handcuffed suspects into custody .... I know I guess I should really let you know how I feel about this DVD .... LOL"
4,a triple,"I approached this book with low expectations. Despite the small type and the fact that one of the authors is a Mets fan, this book is actually pretty good. This guide demystifies rules that confuse even the most ardent fans of the game. It took balls to take on this subject."
5,Baseball Field Guide,"This is an excellent book, exactly what I was looking for. I looked at others in book stores but none were as comprehensive and well illustrated. Explanations were clear and easy to understand."
1,kindle edition worthless,"The KINDLE edition is disappointing: poor graphic quality, page numbers are missing, and it is not possible to jump to a given page, etc...in sum, it is very hard to use it as a reference (which is the stated goal of the book) when it is near impossible to navigate it. The book itself is terrific. Do yourself a favor, be patient and order the paperback edition."
5,A Great Story,"Penny's Gift is an easy to read, fast moving story. Any mother can relate to the life of Penny and the decisions she was faced with. The other characters in this book were also very real and the author did a great job depicting them. I couldn't put the book down!"
2,Hours of my life I'll never get back,"This book started being very interesting, full of secret murder plans, the proposed victim currently in a coma, and a nosy reporter that follows her case like a hawk. It was slow to get started after the initial bang, there was much talk, but it held the pace pretty well. My complaint with this novel is the second half of the book. I didn't feel I knew the characters. They were all cut-outs, stereotypes, that were predictable and uninteresting. Penny, the center of the story, was a bland selfless mother of three. Isaac, the criminal mastermind, is completely evil and greedy. There was no way to like him or humanize him - he was simply a scamming cult leader with an eye for a bargain. After hundreds of pages of reading, I still didn't care whether or not the characters survived. All in all, I wouldn't recommend this book."
5,A YOUNG Woman's Journey through Breast Cancer,"""Facing Fear"" is an excellent read for young women facing Breast Cancer. It is unique and refreshing because it is written from a young woman's perspective---and it reads like a novel! I recommend this book because it eloquently explains the emotional journey, the importance of support from friends and family, as well as the physical journey. It also gives some practical information about radiation and bi-lateral mastectomy with reconstructive surgery. While ""Facing Fear"" is not structured and written as a step-by-step guide, it is an excellent account of one woman's journey from diagnosis to completion of treatment. This book will give young women (and their family and friends) support and information about facing Breast Cancer. Bravo!"
4,Guides the seat belt off of my neck,"This product didn't get the greatest reviews when I was researching gadgets that would help me get the seat belts off of my neck in my Mazda5. It was an affordable product and looked easy enough to use. It arrived quickly and to my surprise the package contained 2 strap adjusters. I thought I was ordering just one. One for my driver side and one for when I am riding as the passenger, that's cool. The instructions were printed on the inside of the package. The little backing bar is different on each end and made it tricky to snap the adjuster together on the first try. I had to press hard, but it was easy enough. As other reviewers noted it does twist into my belly when in use, but it takes the belt off my neck perfectly and I don't notice the adjuster twisting into my belly. Worth the small price, hope it lasts."
3,seat belt,"I am happy with the seatbelt clip, not overjoyed but happy. I wish it had come with instructions, I don't know if I have it hooked right or not but as long as it keeps the belt off my neck thats all I care about. I recieved the item quickly."
2,Didn't live up to my expectations,"These just didn't work as well as I'd hoped. The two pieces were so hard to snap together. Once I had it on the belt the shoulder strap wouldn't stay in place. I checked with others that I had it positioned right but the whole device being slippery plastic, slides all over and isn't comfortable. I kept the back of the package so these are going to Goodwill.Operator error? Maybe but they still aren't very good."
2,Keeps popping off the seatbelt,"After the decent reviews, I purchased this as a Christmas gift for everyone in my family as well as myself. Upon arriving at my brother's house to celebrate Christmas, I didn't know until later but the clip on the passenger had popped off and it's already been lost, and that was just the first time it was used. I feel pretty confident that when I attached them to the seatbelts they were secure. And now, without even using it on my side, with it just attached to the seatbelt, it still popped off. Luckily (maybe), it popped off in the car so I was able to retrieve it."
4,Small and Simple ... my kind of product,This is a nice small and simple to use strap adjuster. I was very pleased with the ease of use and the simple fact that it works. The plastic it was made out of is not to brittle with has some flexibility. No hidden gotchas here.Happy Shopping!
5,Get's the job done!,"What can I say, the product simply works. I only use it on long trips but there is where it makes all the difference. I happen to have a convertible and the strap hits me at a terrible spot. This becomes an issue on long trips. This product has enabled me to stop constantly pushing the belt down and watching it ride right back up and then cutting into my neck. So, bottom line, if you have a seatbelt such as mine I wholeheartedly recommend this product."
3,not as good as I thought,"The idea was a good one, but the application not so much. Being a short(5'3"") woman with a tall(6'4"")spouse I needed a strap adjuster to keep from choking myself eveytime I drove our truck. Unfortunately this version slides too easily on the belt when driving and I'm constantly adjusting it. I need one that can be anchored in one place until manually adjusted. But for the price of 6 bucks, I got what I paid for. I will shop around for another model."
3,Decent given limited product options,"Just before buying these adjusters I'd picked up a pack made by Belkin.I found both to be adequate and can't say either has an edge.The Heininger actually stay attached to the belt between uses, which is a plus. But unsnapping them once properly attached can be tricky. When being used, these adjusters need to be slid to the side of a belt that is pulled tight and low across the lap...which is the proper way to use a belt anyway. If they aren't secured this way, they tend to excessively slide/move along the belt while in use if you happen to move much.The Belkin have a more in-use secure fit, but slip right off the belt when not in use do to their 'open on both sides' design. Also, if you like to wear your belt a little more loosely, these are the better option.Overall, I don't think there is an optimal product for adjusting seat belts out there to date, so this item is no better or worse than others."
4,A good product with bad instructions,"The product has worked very well. I managed to get it on correctly the first time - more luck than anything else - and it has worked great. This was pretty easy to set up once I figured it out. I subtracted one start because of the poor directions. I gave up and just went on intuition and prayers. I am short and curvy, so I have had some difficulty with seatbelt adjustment in the past and have tried several things to help it. This certainly helps and unlike some others, it is not too obtrusive and unattractive."
3,It works OK,"It does help keep the shoulder belt from rubbing my neck. However, it pulls the lap belt up. It's better than nothing."
3,That's it?,"This product works as specified; but I was surprised to find out that it is just two little plastic pieces. If I had known that before purchase, I probably would feel more satisfied. It is easy to install. My daughter can clip it and adjust it so she's comfortable. It solved the problem of raw-neck."
1,How does it attach to seatbelt?,I need some form of instructions which were not included in the package on how to attach to my seatbelt.
4,Love this strap adjuster!!,"I have a problem with the seatbelt choking me. This product really works, I have it on all my vehicles and even the schoolbus I drive. I drive over 100 miles a day and this make it a lot easier since I don't have to keep holding the seatbelt away from my neck."
2,It does not do the job,The idea is good. The design is poor and it does not work. It falls out the belt very frequently. Desapointing !!
1,Disappointed,Bought this for my 4 yr old granddaughter. Difficult to use - 2 separate pieces that only clip together a certain way and are easy to misplace or lose.
1,Stiff and bulky,"I had such high hopes for this product. I HATE a seatbelt that digs into my neck, not only is it not safe, but very uncomfortable too! This is a common problem that a lot of women have (and some men). I was hoping that this seat belt mate would solve my problem, however it was bulky, stiff, unbendy and dug into my stomach. It would not let the seatbelt rewind back into its holder and kept getting stuck in the door when I would close my car door.If it was made out of cloth or some other soft material, I do not think there would be a problem, but as it was made out of hard plastic, it caused more problems than just a seat belt digging into my neck.Sorry, I was not impressed and ended up throwing the CommuteMate into the trash."
2,Keeps the belt off your shoulder but digs into your stomach,"I was hopeful this would work for me. I am 5 ft tall and seat belts never fit me properly. This made the seatbelt fit, but it digs into my stomach as well which is more uncomfortable than the original problem."
2,great concept....poor design,"If you are careful... you might be able to make your trip without it coming apart...but don't count on it. It is poorly designed and Pops off the seat belt too easily. I put some super glue on it, so it holds now. But I shouldn't have to do that. So...a little patience and super glue..and it works"
4,great for shorter adults!,I am a pretty short adult and this really helps the seat belt not choke me. I put one on both front seats for when I drive or when I'm the passenger.
3,Ehh... extra step when buckling in gets old after a while,"I bough my new car knowing that I would need a fix for a seat belt that digs into my neck. It is a sporty car and I am a short girl. After a little research I purchased this and Allison Corporation 54-1214 Memory Foam Seat Belt Comforter about 6 months ago.I have stopped using the Strap Adjuster because it added an extra step to buckling in that was ok for the first 2 months, but quickly got old and I just didn't feel like dealing with it. Plus, even with the Strap Adjusted I needed to use the foam cover.I don't really love the Memory Foam Seat Belt Comforter but I guess at least I'm still using it."
2,Seat belt adjuster???,"This adjuster did bring the belt down a little. It also brought up the lap belt into the stomach and was very uncomfortable. I ended up not using this due the the uncomfortable lab belt. If you do not mind the belt being forced into you stomach, this would work, otherwise look for something else."
2,Over-priced item!!!!!!!!!,Item does the job but can be purchased from Walmart for one third the price charged here.
1,A TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT!,"I am short, and I have been using this type of the Seat Belt Adjusters in all my cars to keep the belt from cutting into my neck. I have recently purchased a new car, and was very happy to discover this Adjuster on Amazon.com. However, upon arrival, the thing turned out to be totally unusable - the tongue does not even click, and all my attempts to fit the adjuster were unsuccessful. I guess, the quality is not there any more."
1,Heininger Automotive 1027 CommuteMate Seat Belt Strap Adjuster,I don't particularly care much for this product. It slides and flips and doesn't actually do the job I expected it to do. I will seek another version and see if I can find something beter.Heininger Automotive 1027 CommuteMate Seat Belt Strap Adjuster
4,Great clip for short people.,"This clip keeps the seat belt from riding across my neck. I am short, and the seat belt always gets on my nerves.The clip just stays on the belt out of the way and I can slip it up and use it when I need it."
5,Serves the purpose well,I'm an overweight person and get tired of seat belts rubbing my neck. This little device is great to help you adjust the seat belt to fit better. It just takes a snap to install and you can easily slide it to where it fits the best for you.
4,Heininger 1027 CommuteMate Seat Belt Strap Adjuster,"I purchased this Heininger 1027 CommuteMate Seat Belt Strap Adjuster, on very good reviews and a strange problem I was having with the seat belts in a newly purchased used Mustang, hoping these adjusters would help the problem, they do; but are uncomfortable while wearing your seatbelt, the plastic adjuster seems to dig into you while wearing the belt, guess this is due to a bad design and size of adjuster and where it must be placed on the belt, I would of return these belt adjusters, except I totally destroyed the package, making it more difficult to return, money lost will just have to live with this decision for now until I find something else that is less troublesome or more comfortable to wear, I really would not recommend this product, but they do seem to be quality made and believe they would not break during an accident."
1,THE END - AGAIN?,"This has to be the dumbest wrap up of a story that I have ever read. Emperor Palpatine has been reduced to a grimmacing, finger pointing, spoiled brat that throws temper tantrums when he doesn't get his way (Does anybody remember COBRA Commander from the 80's cartoon version of G.I. JOE?). I am a big fan of the original DARK EMPIRE series and as far as I am concerned , the story ends there. No DARK EMPIRE II and no EMPIRES END. I am glad that Cam Kennedy had sense enough to bail out after the second series, although his artwork would have improved this wrap up story to a two star outing. If the Emporer is so infinitely powerful, why doesn't he blink himself a new superior clone body into existence? Afterall, he has the power to instantly create so-called ""dark jedi""! And what about the shoddy dialog? Take for instance ""Unnh...the Corellian has killed me..."" or ""hang on rebs -- I'm taking us to jumpspeed!"". Give me a brake. Oh, did I forget to mention the Galaxy Gun?"
3,"Good, but not great","Empire's End was a good conclusion to the Dark Empire Series. I did not expecxt it to be good, because Dark Empire II was horrible. The artwork in this book was a lot better than in the first two. The drawings were clear, and everyone didn't have a green face. However, the story could have used a little more work. Overall, a good book to read, and a good end to the series."
2,"Empire's End, Please","This story line picks up following Dark Empire II. With the exception of the Galaxy Gun being put out of action, as well as the final incarnation of the Clone Emperor, very little sustenance if offered here."
3,So so,"The story was rushed first of all. The artwork was pretty good, but changing artists was a bad choice. The fight sequences were way to short, especially the one to get to the emperors personal ship in EE2. Besides the rushing, the storyline was pretty good, and Brands sacrifice was a nice end to the series."
5,AWSOME!,"I LOVED it! I think that it was terrific because it seemed real. In any other book, the bad guys would always become these killing machines, but in this one, they are more natural. I also like how the emporer fought in the final duel! I think that it is terrific!"
3,Not what it looks like from the cover,"Don't be fooled by this cover. This is not a cartoon with the likenesses of the '39 version. A very short sort of anime looking version of The Wizard of Oz. Not bad I guess, but not great by any means. However, the rest of the content is quite nice. Nothing to do with The Wizard of Oz, but nice vintage cartoons. 2 Little Audrey toons, 2 Betty Boop toons, 2 Raggedy Ann toons and a Walt Disney toon called Susie the Little Blue Coupe.So just be warned that the cover doesn't match the content."
4,THe Goodness Gene,"The Goodness Gene by Sonia Levitin is an unsuspecting book, with vicious ruler in the year 2305. It's got hard decisions, lies, and close friendshipps all revooling around a boy named Will. Will' the son of the most powerful man in the future and always trusted and followed him until heard what Leora had to say. Itdidnt deserve a five brcause it seemedd li8eke i was suppose to know what all the futuristic things in the book were. People who like mysteries and futuristic books would love this book. The book is perfect balence of mischief and even some romance. This fiction is one of those books I would read because of how much I liike it."
3,Disappointing music selection,The Puccini aias are very good. I was disappointed by the selection of Verdi arias.
2,Raynox DCR 150,"I bought this after reading an article in Popular Photography. The article said it was a good, cheap alternative to buying a macro lens. It also showed a sample photo taken with the product, and the quality was quite good. However, the product did not work well with my lens, the Tamron 18-250mm. The vignetting was so severe the image was just a circle in the center of a dark frame. The quality of the image in that circle was not bad, and with certain lenses the product might be worth the money. I would recommend researching what lenses it works well with before buying it. I also think it makes the most sense to use extension tubes for macro work. They don't add any glass in addition to your lens. The only reason I didn't use extension tubes is that they are not made for my camera."
3,it is only 52mm,"With the camera I have you have to have a closeup filter of some sort due to its 4.3mm wide angle lens when no zoom is used. The macro setting is no help in this camera due to this wide angle lens.I have a Cannon sx40hs camera which has a 52mm lens with a 35x zoom and I must use an add on 67mm adapter for filters. The Raynox lens is a 49mm lens and even though the spring fitting will work with a 67mm threaded surface it still has the problem of a circle. With my zoom lens I must zoom out quite a distance to get rid of the circle effect and even then it does not seem to get rid of it completely. I sent it back and bought a lens like the Raynox, that is one which is an achromatic doublet, but it was designed for a 67mm housing only so the lens is larger and I have to zoom out much less to get rid of the circle. It was also less expensive. The Raynox lens is a good one but not for my situation."" [...] """
4,Really good. Get a step-down ring.,"I love the quality of images that this adapter makes possible. I have a little concern about the snap-on universal adapter that comes with it coming off my main lens, so I've purchased a step-down ring which allows me to screw this securely to me lens. With that in place, it's excellent.The threads at the end toward the camera body are 46mm in diameter.The ones at the other side, closest to the subject, are 49mm in diameter.I went ahead and got screw-on lens covers for both sides, to keep it safe when not in use. It does come with slide-on covers, but I want more confidence that the lens will be protected."
4,good for the price,"I am very happy with this lens. I found the actual size of the filter on the lens cap, and will now be able to apply this lens to other larger and smaller lenes I already own. This lens takes great pictures and I am really enjoying it."
5,Love This Conditioner,Fast shipping. Great price. I color my hair and this conditoner works well.It doesn't harm the color. I have more moisture and my hair has been more manageable. Love this stuff.
4,Great!,If you do not believe it can happen then it won't. That is the difference between religion and science. If you beleive that this will not work for you - you get to be right. Congratulations!
5,VERY INSIGHTFUL,POIGNANT TO OUR TIMES AND REALLY ALL TIMES. A REFLECTION MORE FOLKS SHOULD CONSIDER WOULD BE THE PERUSING OF LIKE LITERATURE
5,Sixth Sense is chock full of usable techniques and spirtual truths,"I've read about 1/4 of the book so far and it's awesome. Stuart Wilde breaks down how to improve the senses and be aware of things around us. He also has many explanations about why people are blind and how we are programmed to be that way. He also has usable techniques that one can practice; in fact he has so many that you could refer back to this book for years to come. There are also many asides regarding things of a metaphysical nature that are informative, amusing and priceless in their illumination. I haven't even finished ""Sixth Sense"" and I have to say I've already gotten double my money's worth."
4,"Great music, questionable vocals","Gary Moore's ""Still Got The Blues"" album delivered top notch guitar playing AND vocals. He always has been known more for his guitar playing than his singing, but on that album from 1990 his vocals were very good, particularly on the title track. However, while his guitar is as good as ever on this 2004 ""Power Of The Blues"" release, his vocals, for some reason, have taken on a weird, almost goofy flavor. Maybe he was dissatisfied with his singing on ""Still Got The Blues"" and was trying a ""new style."" Well, Gary, let's leave well enough alone and stick to the formula, my man! We know you can do better! Overall, though, a great blues/rock album. I'm a Gary Moore fan mostly due to his guitar, anyway, so I'm willing to overlook his ""affected"" vocals for the most part."
4,fine drama; but too intense for me,"yes -- it is nicely done, a fine film. but it was more-intense than i realized in advance. i was primary caregiver, watching my mother struggle with cancer for years. and i'm a bit of a spinster/professor myself. so, yes, i continued to watch the film all the way through, but just the once is enough for me. i've given it away in a batch of a/v items as my contribution to a (white elephant) secret santa gift exchange."
5,Heart wrenching and beautiful,"As a widower, whos partner Carole, lost her battle with Germ Cell Ovarian Cancer, at 34, in 2000, this film is full of tears, memories and fears - did Carole suffer this much?I would highly recommend this film to anyone, but caution those personally involved that a period of time may be needed after your loss, before watching.Buy it now though, as it is no longer available at all in Europe, it was never put on DVD over here. The VHS is now only available from a few Marketplace sellers in USA, so buy it today.Most UK VCR players now take the US format, though not the DVD.I am buying copies, before the VHS goes completely, to pass to fiends and family.I agree with others, it should be required viewing to anyone who works in cancer care.Thank you for a beautiful film"
3,Worth watching,"This movie is a requirement for one of my nursing classes. Although, it is exaggerated (for effect), the desensitization displayed by the medical employees makes the movie relevant for those of us in healthcare.The theme is somewhat overstated and dramatized, not much subtly to the movie, still I enjoyed the movie. Certainly preferred it over other classroom assignments."
2,Not Funny,"Maybe I have not been fair as I did not watch all this movie, finding it depressing. Speaking for myself, don't like movies about sickness though admit there are many inspiring stories where people have triumphed over illness. Just not my bag."
1,Not Viewable in Australia,Do not waste your money buying this DVD that you cannot watch in Australia - Amazon is a con
2,Couldn't get past the subject,The early scenes in the doctor's office are just too uncomfortable for anyone with a fear of disease. I skipped the rest.
2,Wit,"This was a very informative movie regarding the ""horror"" that sometimes can be chemo therapy. The gratuitous nudity at the end was disturbing to me. The point could have been made just as well without it."
5,death: upclose & personal,"Wonderful movie - shows death & dying from a personal, up-close perspective. See how oblivious the medical establishment can be!"
5,A must for future Healthcare providers,"I think that this should be required viewing for any future healthcare provider. Not only does it teach a lesson of the importance of kindness when it comes to patient care, it also helps give a glimpse into the world of someone used to complete control and then utterly stripped of it. It takes her back to the barest necessities, the first principles if you will of humanity. Healing does not always mean curing."
3,wit,i choose this rating because i have not watched the movie yet and there is no choice to indicate that. i am looking forward to viewing it whem i am ready
5,Amazing Movie!,"This is an incredible story about a woman who is diagnosed with stage 4 ovarian cancer. We go through with her (""her"" being Emma Thompson, the lead actress) as she goes through an experimental 8 treatments with the fullest dose of chemotherapy possible. It's funny, it's beautiful and it will definitely make you cry. It's one of the best movies I've seen in a long time."
5,Brilliance on all sides,"It seems to me that certain matters can be understood, that is to say, experienced at arms length back here where it's safe, only with art. If your loved one dies of a terrible progressive illness, you know the experience intimately. Yet understanding may take awhile, if it ever comes. If you yourself are desperately ill, you live in a cocoon of pain, embarrassment, fear and anger. You experience this only to the degree your mental capacity remains unimpaired. Understanding your experience may be a low priority. Yet, this film, like the ennui of Waiting for Godot, or the visual assault of Jackson Pollack, the cynicism of Lolita, or the anguish of Mahler's last adagio, sends us flying - transported to a place where we have, finally, an understanding, a closure. This film is a quiet little diamond - you can look at it from any angle and find not suffering, not degradation, but transcendent light. The greatest art shows us how rich life can be."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Smart, insightful, and elegaic, Wit is a moving film about a lonely and intelligent woman preparing herself for death; although the direction sometimes gets a bit too gimmicky (as when Emma Thompson is inserted into her childhood memories) and the pace is too slow for the film to be described as ""entertaining,"" Wit is a very good film that deserves to be seen."
3,Cold and stagy,"I feel like a bit of a Philistine giving a middling review to a film which is so deeply moving to so many other reviewers, but it just didn't do it for me. Emma Thompson gives a wonderful performance as the English professor dying of ovarian cancer, but the film as a whole seemed rather cold. The only scene that really moved me was the one in which her old teacher and mentor came to visit her, sitting in bed with her and reading a children's book."
3,Wit,"The movie is depressing to some people. It is a well structured movie, however, it start off slow the becomes better as it shows."
5,Emma Thompson is superb,"The senior academic of Wit has stage 4 cancer. She can still approach her situation with words, intellect and wit until they are all leached from her by academic medicine and disease. In the end the puzzles of the Holy Sonnets of Donne do not comfort as much as the simplicity of The Runaway Bunny by Margaret Wise Brown. This is not about melodramatic or philosophical death; there is no distance between deah and the viewer. There is no intellectual defense, but human kindness is a comfort."
5,Sad but Enlightening,"Wow what a moving movie. The acting was great. The story moved along nicely. Extremely thought provoking. It touched on the differences of human nature, life and death. Chances are someone in your life has been touch by cancer. This movie shows what was like for one individual."
3,"OK, but limiting. Mostly camera design issue.","I don't use this camera anymore, but this adapter allowed me to use a polarizing filter, which would have been impossible without it. Because the camera is not a SLR and the lens barrel has no threads, the adapter gets somewhat in the way of the otherwise pretty compact camera. I would say consider getting a DSLR if you want to use filters regularly."
1,Don't bother,"Just tried to do streaks of Red Hot H9 and actually left it in for an hour. Washed completely out. NOTHING! I have dyed dark brown hair so maybe it's because its not on virgin hair. So if you already dye your hair, stay away. Nothing stayed...not even a hint of it. ugh"
3,"Thoughtful analysis of the ""Femme Fatale"" in key noir films.","Author does a thought-provoking analysis of the femme fatale in several key noirs 1940-present.Especially interesting are essays on ""Double Indemnity"",""Out of the Past"", and ""Thelma and Louise"".Book does not rehash conventional explications on these films regarding the ""fatal women"" represented in each.Anyone interested in film noir or the theme of the ""fatal woman"" in many of these films will find this book hard to put down.This book assumes that the reader have some familiarity with the films it discusses, or else much of the analysis will seem obscure. Recommended for the reader with more than a passing interest in the film noir genre."
4,Nice figures,"I'm new to molecular evolution and have been confused with various terms and concepts (e.g., cladogram vs. phylogram vs. dendrogram, plesiomorphy vs. apomorphy vs. autapomorphy vs. synapomorphy vs. homoplasy, etc.). Reading other books that try to explain these concepts mostly in words only added more confusion.Every page in this book contains highly illustrative figures that accompanies well written text. Of course, not all sections are not immediately clear to understand, and I would need to read other books as well.If you are new to molecular evolution, start with this book along with any other books that may suit your particular need."
3,Missing pages,The book was in great condition except there were about 8 or 9 blank pages in the middle of the book. Luckily I have a friend with the same book so I just made copies of the missing pages and taped them into my book.
1,would not recommend,We use this book in the class and most of us don't like it. The book just doesn't do a good job explaining many things. Unless you are an expert in the field or at least have prior experience I would not recommend you this book.
3,"first episode is good, but second one is cheesy","I like the first episode, ""The Spy Who Came In From the Cool."" It was really funny when the guys imagine themselves as spy agents and scientists. But, I really dislike the second episode, ""Card-carrying Red Shoes,"" or whatever the title is. Why? Well, Micky is usually funny in the show, but he is not funny in this episode. Also, his curly hair gets in the way. I liked it better straight. Okay. That's it. So if you want to laugh, watch the first episode, and then if you want to get quite annoyed, watch the second one too. Thank you."
3,Adequate,"I found this guidebook adequate. The maps were interesting, but small. I did enjoy the Walking Tours section. I am not sure how many hotels they review, because the hotel I earlier booked is not mentioned. I was not interested in the cheap eats and cheap sleeps information; I felt it caused the book to be more suitable for backpackers rather than middle aged, middle class travelers. Having street names spelled in romanji (roman letters) was somewhat helpful; using the actual Japanese script would have been top notch though."
3,not a 3 cupper,I love the basics of it....but this 3 cup press does not produce 3 cups. 1 cup if you are lucky. I would have moved up a size if I had known.
2,"tiny, not as decribed","This is cute but no way is it 3 cups, even small ones. I was looking for something to fill one large mug, and this only makes 10 oz. Not even close."
2,Fragile Glass Container,"The coffee press looks very nice and very functional, except that the glass container is very easy to break. After it breaks, the entire press turns to be unusable. It breaks after any water (not even too cold at all) from faucet touches the glass while I just used it to make coffee so that the glass is still hot. It breaks easily while I wash dishes because the glass is so thin and it cannot withstand any hitting from other dishes. As far as I know, Amazon does not sell replacement glass carafe for this brand. I just broke the 3rd one. Will not buy again."
1,Metal shavings included,"Ahhh, nothing finer than metal shavings in my cup of morning coffee. The guide for the press rod is razor sharp and shaves off metal as it passes through the cap, I returned it."
4,"Good product, careful on the ""Cups""","While the description states ""3 cups"" I actually measured how many cups of water it could hold and it hovered right around 2. In terms of how many coffee mugs this thing makes, it is one full one. This meets my needs perfectly as I live alone and only need one cup in the morning, but if you are entertaining guests upgrade for a larger size. The filter screen does a great job and the press is easy to clean."
4,LaCafetiere Optima 3 Cup Coffee Press,"LaCafetiere Optima 3 Cup Coffee Press. I love it. I gave it 5 out of 6 stars (and not 6)because it says 3 cup. I was under the impression that a cup usually meant a 6 oz cup. 6 0z times 3 is 18 oz. But it doesn't fill my 15 oz mug. Other than that. I love it. It makes great coffee and is easy to use and clean. I'll leave it at work (I'm a third shift Security Guard)and buy another Larger one for home.LaCafetiere Optima 3 Cup Coffee Press, Chrome"
4,French coffee press,great way to get rich hot coffee quickly..the only problem seems to be the coffee 'silt' at the bottom of the cup...but we're enjoying this method of getting our caffeine fix first thing each morning!
3,Coffee press,"This is a cute little coffee press. I thought it was a great price for a 3-cup. But, it's really a 1 cup... it holds 10 ounces of coffee. I'm not sure how they can say 3 cups... I've always know 1 cup to mean 8 ounces. So, for me and my husband to have coffee together, we have to each do our own pot. It does work well. I would give it 5 stars because it does do what it is suppose to do, but I only give 3 because it's really not a 3 cup press."
1,Very Fragile,"Have had this item less than 3 weeks...I have used exactly according to directions...always stirred with plastic spoon or straw. I took it down from cabinet today to make a cup of coffee (one American cup is what you get) and there was a crack running down the side of the glass carafe..I have absolutely no idea what I did to cause this, and obviously put it away in the cabinet without even knowing it was broken. I have broken a few glass items in my 33 years of marriage, usually due to dropping on the tile floor, but this is a first for me. I guarantee I would never have placed it back in the cabinet to use again had I known it was broken. Just a bit too fragile for my taste..can I return this to Amazon?"
3,"Kevin Nyberg Cadillac, Michigan",I purchase this item for Christmas and have found it produced very good coffee. It is a bit more time consuming and cleanup is a bit messy but the coffee is worth the effort. I like the fact that you can get a good flavor without the hassle of buying filters to run the coffee through. It is user friendly and easy to set up. I found that you really didn't need the amount of coffee the instructions ask for to produce a good flavor. I used about the same amount of coffee grounds that I put in my automatic coffee maker to produce a good cup of coffee. The only drawback that I can see is you have to drink the coffee shortly after making it as it cools rather quickly without a heating element.
5,love it,The product is made very well...easy to clean....makes about 4 cups of american coffee. sometimes a little bit of grinds go into cup of coffe if coffe is ground to much. great product
4,"12 Cups, 3 1/2 Mugs","I drink too much coffee, so this is the perfect size. I imagine if you're single that this would be too large for you. It is a good, functional press, and has a good seal."
4,The LaCafetiere Optima 12-Cup Coffee Press is elegant and makes good coffee.,The LaCafetiere Optima 12-Cup Coffee Press looks good on the table and makes good coffee. The container is made of glass which is fragile and needs to be handled carefully.
3,More so a 1 cup coffee press.,Maybe if they are three tiney espresso cups then that would make sense. Other than that it works great. I mostly make coffee for myself so it actually turned out to be perfect.
5,Coffee press,"Works great. The top stays on when you pour it, and the carafe doesn't slide out. No back-drip when you pour. A perfectly fine coffee press."
5,GREAT for brewing loose tea!,"I know that is NOT its intended use, yet it is perfect! Even Rooibos' fine particles are trapped with this great press. I get to make some great tea and fast/easy cleanup as well. MUCH better than most tea kettles. Well, if you don't have a secondary incentive of reading tea leaves that is. Go for it! Well made, unassuming, fully metal. Love it."
2,Dishwasher safe? Yes according to Product Review - NO according to the manufacturer,"Perfect size, but it isn't dishwasher safe even though Amazon say it is. So I will be returning it.I had a Bodrum for 10+ years that I put in the dishwasher on a daily basis and if I could figure out which replacement beaker I needed I wouldn't need a new cafetiere.I'll keep looking"
4,"Very good, but lacks teeth","I have also done a review for the first album, which I thought was one of the best albums of the year. That being said let's move to Naomi's Sophmore album. I'll start off by saying that is still is very good in terms of music and production value. What it doesn't have however is the variety that instilled the first one. This album seems to have more of a set mood and plays on that all the way through. Unlike the first album which has many moods, this one is much more focused. This can be a good thing or a bad thing. If you are a fan, this album is worth it, but you may want to wait till it comes out in the States so you don't pay $30. I hope their next album returns with more variety, but I'm not mad that they didn't make the same album twice."
4,Not Better Than WWD,"When Dinosaurs Roamed America is a movie similar to ""Walking with Dinosaurs"", it shows dinosaurs made with computer animation in a documentary style (like nature shows). Since both movies are similar, a fair comparison can be made. The computer animation is excellent just as in WWD. The music is average classical stlye, but not as good as WWD. The narrator in this movie is, Mr. John Goodman, who did a pretty good job, but does not match the excellent narration of the one in WWD. A few other things kind falters in this movie, ""When Dinosaurs Roamed America"": it's very short, it has similar scenes to WWD, they even took similar narration lines. Overall it's a very good movie but lacks the poetic beauty of Walking with Dinosaurs DVD, but it's still a good purchase."
3,"Same old, same old....","Ok, I did enjoy this, & it was informative. The graphics, I thought, were up to standards. One major problem: many of the scenes seemed like they were taken straight out of other Discovery Channel prgroams. If you've watched any of their other dinosaur programs, especially Walking With Dinosaurs, you'll find a lot of repetition. However, if this is your first time watching one of their dinosaur programs, its excellent, & you'll enjoy it."
3,Enjoyable but not up to Walking with Dinosaurs,"Five years ago, I probably would have given When Dinosaurs Roamed America a rave review. It is a good dinosaur special, well done overall and with interesting effects. But in the post-Walking with Dinosaurs era, it's a bit of a letdown. The animation is not as good, nor is the writing as sharp.One other note: John Goodman is really not up the level of either Kenneth Branaugh (British version of Walking with Dinosaurs as well as the DVD version) or Avery Brooks (the version of Walking With Dinosaurs shown on the Discovery Channel). The latter two treat it as a serious nature special. Goodman's narration makes it sound like he's narrating a children's TV special, not a nature special."
2,don't rush it,"After watching what the BBC does with CGI and what can be done with CGI I found this to be quite disappointing. The attention to detail was lacking from start to finish. What the past actually looked like is definitely open to interpretation and this DVD does interpret the dinosaurs in a different way, atleast visually. The look of the dinosaurs is good but the imaging of the dinosaurs in action is dodgy.This desperatley needed someone to write a decent storyline for it to follow rather than jumping all over the place and not really teaching you anything. The inclusion of some clips of paleantologists explaining some finds was interesting but was not adequately linked to the dinosaur footage.It was more about America than it was about the dinosaurs....have another go fella's!!!!"
5,Loved the Sister Circle Series!!!!,"I originally bought the first one as a gift for my mother. She loved it and recommended it to me. We've read all four in the series and shared them with friends. Great friendships, real life temptations and struggles, and hope presented in a way to make God's love for us come alive!"
5,great live show,"i saw these guy's live in vegas and had a chance to talk to former caliban bass player and new guitarist, let me say i bought the album a few days after that and i've been listing ever since, the album really never gets old, but i also have caliban and that gets old fast. so buy venom divine you wont regret it, it's swedish hardcore at it's best."
3,Ben Elton Meets Gregg Hurwitz,"The story begins in a sardonically gritty British writing style reminding me of Ben Elton (but not quite as sharp) and was surprised when the story got darker in the latter stages.Emotionally constipated Ian sees himself as a stickleback - stuck in a routine he hates but also needs. He also despises his dull work colleague, Archie who sits opposite him in a corporate office. But Ian's life falls into turmoil when he has a brush against 2 unsavoury characters who blackmail him into planting a bug in the office systems. Ian not only has a rude awakening, he also hits a crisis where he no longer knows where his life is heading or who to trust. In places, the narrative digresses into the character's cynical viewpoints of life, which at times interferes with the story (although I thought the chapter about Being Alone was incisive). A blockey, nineties sort of book with some unexpected twists at the end, I thought I would enjoy the book more than I actually did."
3,Beautiful Artwork,"Vangelis, Tim Wheater, Michael Hoppe and Frederic Delarue make the Spirit of this release. Although some pieces are out of place here as Kenny G and Richard Burmer and the sound quality of this release is a disappointment, I like this CD. Real Music really did a great artwork."
2,Uneven collection,"I hate to cast a shadow on a worthy (fund-raising) release but this was a terribly disappointing purchase. Some of the tracks were rather clumsy (Yanni) or derivative (2002's Enya rip-off) and there didn't seem to be any match between the tracks and the avowed conception for the album. The mix levels varied so much that I had to keep playing with my volume control. Licensed Massage Therapists beware!Why is Kenny G's ""Dying Young"" theme on this album? Music-lovers beware.The 2 short Vangelis tracks (from the soundtrack of 1492:Conquest of Paradise) are harmonically more interesting than the companion tracks. However the track ""Eternity"" did not seem to fit a Cousteau/Aquatic theme. It would have been more fitting to use some of his music from the album ""Oceanic"" (heck - buy that album and send a few bucks to the Earthsea Institute) or to publish some of the unreleased music Vangelis created for early Cousteau documentaries."
3,Uneven collection makes this noble concept sink,"A tribute CD to Costeau with watery graphics on the inserts. So why not at least titles with water themes? Despite great tracks from Vangelis (two selections - is that why his name is assigned as artist on this page?), Kitaro and 2002, most of the remaining tracks are unmemorable."
3,okay,"I bought this product to help my son with addition, but was a little disappointed because they are like a card game. Very thin. I was expecting more like dominoes at least a cardboard, but they are not. As to educational value they should provide reinforcement so might be helpful."
4,Good way to practice addition.,"I bought this product because my 8yr old does not like math. I am always looking for games to try to entice him to practice his addition. This game is easy to learn and is based on dominoes (which he already liked). He was reluctant at first but once he got to playing the first game he declared that he liked it, a lot! He asks to play this game on a regular basis. The cards are only heavy card stock so over time and with use they will become worn or bent but the cost is low so it is worth it."
4,small trinket box,"This is a very small trinket box. It could fit in the palm of your hand, but if you are a collector, it is adorable. My daughter collects Nightmare Before Christmas and I know she will love this trinket box."
2,trinket box,"This product is smaller than it appears, its able to fit in the palm of your hand and really cant hold anything. It is more of a collectors item."
1,painfully bad,"Don't be fooled by this book's cute premise. Loveable dogs and a lively city do not stop THE DOG WALKER from being utterly dreadful. This book has mundane characters saying inane things, and acting out a clunky, lame, unrealistic plot. It's not even fun to read, like chick-lit ought to be, but tedious tedious tedious.I'd rather be out walking my own dog than reading this tripe."
1,Disappointed,"I was looking for a light read and the title caught my eye. I really couldn't get into the book nor past the offensive language. Gave up, complete waste of time and money. Save yours."
3,Slow start but ended well,This book was slow to grab my attention in the beginning! I actually put it down and made myself come back and read more several different times. I am glad I stuck with it. The book was heartwarming and very fun! I was turned off a bit by the swear words but overall I loved it!
5,"Adorable, fun, leaves you waiting for the sequel!","Nina, the main character in the book, seemed like someone I wanted to be best friends with. This book made me laugh out loud several times and I just loved it. The humor and insights are great. I sat down with it and didn't get up until it was done. In some places, it made me think of the best Shakespeare -- all those mistaken identities. Very smart. Very clever. It will make a superb movie, too. I can't wait to read Schnur's next book!"
1,"Banal, unrealistic, and just plain dumb",The plot is unrealistic and boring. It tries to be funny and it's painfully not. The characters are shallow and forgetable. I'm embarrassed just admitting that I even read this book.
1,more like dog poo,"TERRIBLE writing, cringe-worthy dialogue, and an annoyingly contrived plot. There's a lot of good chick lit out there, and this isn't it. I very nearly threw the book across the room several times and read particularly bad passages aloud to my boyfriend so he could be as horrified as I was that something this bad actually got published. I'd give half a star if that were an option.For good women's fiction, stick to writers like Jane Green, Lolly Winston, Sarah Salway, and Marian Keyes. Those ladies really know what their doing."
3,A fun brainless read,"Sometimes I like to read frivolous, fun, brainless books and this one was perfect. Not too deep, not too thought provoking, but fun characters and fun dogs make it a fun read."
4,Practice Makes Perfect,"Schaum's outlines are perfect for what they propose to do -- give the student as much practice as possible. They are experience tools, not teaching tools. The secret to doing well in genchem/orgchem is to practice, practice practice. The more problems you do, the better you will become. Concepts and theories are only half the game in chemistry."
1,it is not helpful,"Very few of the Schaum's outline series are helpful. This one is no exception. It does nothing to clarify the confusing concepts. All it does is provide more problems. Anyone taking organic chemistry knows that it is hard enough to have time to do all the problems in the assigned textbook let alone do more from this book. Furthermore,the answers to the questions are poorly explained. Save your time and money and check out your school library for other helpful books instead."
1,Schaums outline organic chemistry,"It was not the updated copy as shown it was an outdated very very old issue, I am very upset by the book, I will hesitate to order anything else from Amazon."
1,More crap from the crack corpse,"He sucked when he was alive and he sucks now that he's a snack for maggots. I heard an bootleg of this and I see why nobody wants to release this. It's disgusting that this crack head, who raped and tortured a woman along with his then soon to be trailer trash wife, would have a song called sex slave. May you burn in hell Rick."
1,No No No!,"A agree with what someone else said, these unwarranted praise reviews are ridiculous! This is Eric's weakest efforts ever! The problem is the songs which just arent that good. He waited 12 years to make a record after his surging popularity during Dirty dancing. He should have made another album back than when he still had better songwriting skills and all that momentum! He pretty much retired after that other than this klunker no albums and no touring at all. I'll never understand why someone retires when they have a gift to offer the world and their fans. It's just a waste!"
1,Better luck next time...,No tours and no hits since 1988. No US release since 1985. He's outlived his musical usefulness.
1,"Absolutely a DREADFUL ALBUM- ""Winter Nightmares""","The previous reviewers must be completely tone deaf. This is a terrible album that got no traction at all, and deserves to be used as a drink coaster. I was a big fan of this artist's work in the 1980's and now this album leaves me wishing I'd saved my money. Nothing memorable, just a bunch of copycat, retread tracks stolen from other artists. Horrible. I barely made it to the end of the CD."
3,NOT HIS BEST BUT NOT BAD,"""Boats Against the Current"" is still Eric Carmen's best album, but considering how much time has gone by without recordings, I was pleased to buy and listen to this album. There are definite moments of his best style of writing and singing. ""Almost Paradise"" is probably the weakest song. Not every album will be a home run but this is a strong double."
4,The ballads are great,"You won't be disappointed if you're a Carmen fan. The ballads are great, but his faster songs, as usual, are a bit too bubble-gummy. Carmen wrote all but two of the songs here, and records some of the songs he's written that others have successfully recorded. Well worth the import price."
5,Outstanding!,"Our son was recently diagnosed with ASD, and I have been reading constantly since then. A child psychologist told me that she felt this book was so important, she would buy it herself to give to parents who couldn't afford it. This is far and away the best book I've found to teach us how to communicate with our child. It is easy to read and offers actual instructions on how to help your child understand you and respond to you. It takes many principles from Greenspan's books and puts them into practice. I actually bought it from the NC Autism Society's bookstore and it was soooo much cheaper! (By the way, you can order online or over the phone from them.) I would highly recommend this book to any parent of a child with ASD."
5,Perfect for caretakers of kids with ASD,"My twin sons were diagnosed with ASD at 18-months-old. They would make little to no eye contact, would not point, and any cooing or babbling was gone. Thanks to being referred to an Early Intervention program by the public school system in my area they are making great progress.The school system also included an option for me to attend the Hannen ""More than Words"" program for parents. The book ""More Than Words"" was provided, and I've used it regularly to the point that I feel a need to buy my own copy. My children are now pointing to objects and looking at me (which wasn't happening 6 months ago). They now participate and anticipate during our ""song"" time. The book also offers many ideas on how to incorporate communication learning with play that I would not have come up with on my own.This book has been an absolute life saver for all of us!"
1,"The story of a man who followed after God, no matter what.","This book tells the story of a man who, at age 13, heard the voice of the Lord, ""Go into all the world and preach the Gospel."" He was also given a vision of waves of young people carrying the Gospel into all nations. He actually did preach in every nation, before he was 60. He formed a missions organization called ""Youth With A Mission (YWAM) and saw thousands of young people carry the Gospel to almost every nation, and the story of God's supernatural enabling in all this is very exciting. What an encouragement!"
4,Useful and educational.,"Not as comprehensive as I had hoped, but some great clips not seen elsewhere. I would recommend it for anyone interested in the history and evolution of American Theatre and social dance."
3,Spell Check??,"The sentence structure and spelling in this book are less than optimal. This surprised me, as this was one of my more expensive textbooks. Page 114 Figure 4.1 is a good example of poor spelling and sentence structure. I noticed it just now, so that is why I decided to write my review."
5,Child Development used study guide,"Better World Books was awesome! The shipping was super fast, their emails were professional and very efficient. Unlike some others that sell on Amazon. Next semester when I have to buy books I'm going to look out for betterworldbooks! Thank you."
5,Excellent!!!,"This book has become part of my permanent library. It arrived on time, and in a condition that was better than expected."
1,Why the good reviews,If you don't like religion then get out and move on. Who cares? Maybe the saps who want to whine about abuse and religion. Everybody's been abused in one way or another. What makes you so special?
4,"OK, Are People missing the fact that this is a re-issue?","OK, I love Tony Bennett, but nowhere did it say on Amazon that this is a compilation re-issue of work Tony did in the 70's on Concord records with the likes of Bill Evans and others. Concord PR people call this a kind of jazz period for Tony which is absurd since he dabbled in it his entire career. I am not disappointed, I just wish there was full disclosure of the content on Amazon. The CD itself does disclose this information. Thanks go to Concord for the re-issue. Is Tony done with Columbia? If so, Concord - please sign him again!!!"
4,The last of the Crooners,"So tired of people hopping on the Rod Stewart bandwagon. Rod Stewart should stick to what he knows and not make a mockery of the American Songbook. 79 Years old and Tony Bennett is the last of his kind and has more talent than any of these new hacks. Tony is just doing the same thing hes done for almost 60 years, its a shame people end up buying a Rod Stewart Songbook album... just shows ignorance and lack of taste. Rock and Roll artist with a gravel voice singing standards.. please. Get a Sinatra or Bennett album and hear what the soundbook should sound like. Bennett shows his age on this album but handles the songs well and definetly makes this a worthwhile purchase, only reason it gets 4 stars is because Bennett in his prime was untouchable."
2,Disappointed,Disappointing song selection. Feels like some old side B's used to flesh out the album.
4,Good concept book...,"My 4-year old daughter is hard of hearing and is getting 2 hearing aids. This was a good book to help explain hearing aids to her and to the other children in her class. It's a little outdated due to the type of equipment described, but the concepts are the same. At 4 years old, I think it's more important to explain the concept than the equipment..."
4,A great way to introduce a child to a hearing aid.,"This is a book to help kids understand what a hearing aid is and why some children need one. The parents of Angie, the girl in this book, did not know she needed one until it became obvious that she was misunderstanding everything that was said to her. If a child who wears a hearing aid will be coming to your child's clasroom, this book gives a humorous introduction to what a hearing aid is and how it works."
2,It works...kind of.,"I bought this item for my new apartment because the signal here is weak. I loose a lot of calls but there is good signal next to the window. I set the box up, but the instructions say it needs 15 feet of VERTICAL clearance between the base unit and the antenna. I separated them as much as I could; however, it would only work while I was standing right next to the base unit. maybe a 3' to 4' radius. If you can set the antenna on the roof, 15 or more feet above the base unit it might work. I sent the item back, and Amazon gave me a full refund."
1,Go for the one with both frequencies,Did not work in the intended location (Hormigueros Puerto Rico) because aparantly the wrong frequency. The Att website indicates that the frequency should work but it did not. Big paper weight!
2,It's Fussy,"Installing the ZBoost increased the number of bars from ""0"" inside the main room in our house to 3 or 4. However, I encountered problems connecting with the service which I eventually learned came from standing too close to the base unit with the phone (when I noticed a red light flashing). I also encountered ""clipped"" words and occasional ""network busy"" issues that I did not get in good service areas away from the house with the same phone. I decided the system was disappointing, and dismantled the installation. It may work better in another location or with a different service provider."
2,Should have listened,"Other reviews indicated problems with performance. I wish I had listened. While the unit was easy to install and start-up, it did not increase the usefullness of our phones in our small house."
2,Carefully assess your living situation,"I live in a bottom-floor apartment surrounded by many trees and in a fairly dead zone for my Sprint PCS 1900 MHz service. I have tried many antenna and base combinations, including mounting the antenna outside of my building, and can not see much difference in the performance of my phone. It seems (but I may be wrong about this) that the booster only boosts the *incoming* signal from the cell phone tower, but does not boost the *outgoing* signal from your phone. A such, I am able to hear my caller clearly, but they can not hear me clearly, and my calls still frequently drop when my phone and the tower lose communication. I believe that this product would work in a place where you have open air for the signal transmitted by your phone to be properly received by the tower. The tower is much more sensitive than your phone. For places that are heavily obstructed by trees, buildings, walls, etc., I would not recommend this product."
3,Problem with Sprint cell reception at home,"Although the cell tower is only a half mile away, the reception in my home is terrible. The trees and power lines cause more of a problem than anywhere else. I use a Treo 650 and rarely lose a call anywhere else. The VX500 helps, but I need to mount the receiving antenna to a better line-of-sight location. After I've used it that way I will add to this review."
3,"Works, but not as well as I had hoped","The product definitely works. After installing a Radiant Barrier in the roof, I lost all cell signal (had 2 bars before that). After installing the YX500 (mounting on the roof), I now get about 2 bars if I am in an adjacent room to the receiver. If I go further than one room away, I rarely get a signal. So, it works, but the range is a little disappointing."
5,Good product. Working for me.,I purchased this unit and installed the antenna outside my window on the second floor of my house. I live in an area that has about 1-2 bars of signal outside my house but none inside. I originally tried to put the booster on my second floor so i could place calls from my first floor with minor improvement of signal. After tilting the antenna the signal improved. I decided that I needed the signal to be the best on the first floor in the living room and finally decided to install the unit on the first floor of my house.You should test the unit for the best placement BEFORE actually installing it like another person did (see other review)and then complained that it didn't work for him.This unit will not create a signal if you don't have any to begin with.
4,Product does what it says it does,This product does what it is advertised to do. It will take an acceptable outside signal and bring it inside. It does not create or boost the outside signal and the range inside might be less than you hoped. Works great for a single office but I doubt you'll be satisified for an 1800+ sq ft home.I used it to get good signal into my basement home office and it works great for that. Before I couldn't hold a call for more than a minute without dropping and now I can hold a 2 hour phone call with only minor signal issues. Used to have 0-1 bars and now have 2-4 bars.Also be aware that the outside antenna must be 12 or more feet higher than the inside transmission unit or they will interfere with each other.If you take these caveats in mind and it still meets your needs you will be satisfied.
2,Did not work for me.,"I tried this system with various types and arrangements of antennas but could not get reliable cell phone service. Whenever I turned on my phone the amplifier indicated the error mode of oscillation caused by having the indoor and outdoor antennas too close together, even when I had them 50 - 60 feet apart rather than the recommended 25 feet. I eventually bought a Wilson SOHO amplifier with Yagi PCS outdoor antenna and a directional indoor antenna and that works well.The only reason I gave this two stars rather than 1 is that my case my be more challenging than normal because I need to amplify a weak signal on my home network while there is a strong roaming signal already at my house."
2,Didn't work for me,"I bought this unit based upon very detailed evaluations and instructions of P MSakamoto's review on this device. Unfortunately, I could not get it to function properly in my home, despite multiple positioning attempts of the base unit. We get one or two bars on our iPhones in the home and 2 or 3 on our roof. I returned the unit for a refund."
1,Does not work as said.,"I have a cingular phone, and live in bay area. I get a decent network coverage outside my apartment, and at most of the places inside. However, there are some dead spots which I wanted to remove, so got this signal booster.After installing it, I get full signal on the cell phone when im <1 feet away from the base station. However, anything beyond that, its the same signal. It does not work as said. I tried it for 2 days, didn't really see a difference in the service."
1,Cell Phone Booster,The unit was easy to install but its performance is erratic. I have added a directional antenna but the performance has not improved.
1,Very Dissapointing Performance,I had high hopes for this cell phone signal booster but was very disappointed in its performance and returned the item. I did get it to work by placing the antenna outside where the signal was marginal but would support a normal phone connection. The inside signal did work but the range was very limited and it sometimes dropped calls for no obvious reason. Amazon was very accommodating in taking it back but I'm frustrated and still looking for an affordable solution for my poor reception problem.
1,I know better,"I bought this from Radio Shack without doing my homework. Running wires, drilling holes, and crawling through my hot attic only to discover that this product is useless. Now I have to crawl back up to take it down. Sigh....."
1,Junk!,"I bought this item and exchanged it three times because I assumed that I just got a defective one.After trying four units, I've concluded that the product does not work as advertised. In contrast, I've also tried the Wilson cellular repeaters and they seem to work great."
2,Stop the 2500 sqft coverage claim,"I concur with other reviewers! This is a single room (maybe some directly adjacent rooms, DEFINITELY SINGLE FLOOR UNIT!) If you are close to the unit on the same floor it will work beautifully. And yes, I have tried all the various antenna configurations!!! I think companies should be forced to stop this false advertising nonsense. 2500sqft in an open field maybe, NOT IN HOUSES EVER, unless your house is completely made out of glass! Just writing nonsensical disclaimers into the manual doesn't cut it: ""Walls and floors may reduce signal strength!"" How about ""Walls and floors will certainly reduce signal strength! Greater coverage only reliable in homes with very open rooms! Best used in small one bedroom apartments!"""
2,Amy Adams is terrible; Meryl/Stanley are wonderful,"The portrayal of Julia Child by Meryl Streep is worth watching over and over - it's funny, charming, and interesting. Amy Adams' pathetic Julie is so bad I almost fast-forwarded through her scenes toward the end. She goes through no internal change; she gains no inspiration through her year of cooking. She just alienates her husband, acts like a brat, and complains 90 percent of the time. Adams was a bad choice for this character and the character sucks no matter who had been cast. This movie is watchable only for Meryl & Stanley's scenes, and they are worth it - but you can skip the rest."
2,A sleeper,"Having never seen Julia child, I thought this would be interesting. However, it centers on Julie who turns out to be a big bore! I actually slept through most of it, offered it to friends, who very promptly turned it down! Guess I will send it to the nearest thrift shop!"
5,Julie & Julia DVD,"Wonderful film, terrific actors. Meryl Streep BECOMES Julia! All the acting is terrific. I have already watched it three times including once in the theatre. I thrived on Mastering the Art of French Cooking when my children were babies and they were raised on a good many of Julia's recipes which they now have incorporated into their own cooking. I give this DVD my highest recommendation not only for you ladies but the men will enjoy it too!"
2,Flaccid,"My wife had wanted to see this for a long time. We did. She didn't dislike it as much as I, but she was hardly impressed. I was somewhere between annoyed and exasperated. There is simply nothing good to say about it. The characters are bland (despite the over-the-top Meryl crucifixion of Julia,, there's really not much there), and though there may be a good story in here, we never see it. Julie is tedious, a self-absorbed, vain, selfish, and boring affectatious jerk. (I was hardly surprised to read that she has had a few, umm, marital issues since her success.) Julia is wild and crazy, but unreal. How this flighty and high-strung wacko could do what the real Julia did is not plausible.That Buick was lovely. The scenery great. Amy Adams is a star to be. But this tepid consomme was dull, dull, dull, dull, dull."
2,Underdone? staight biopic would have been better.,"More mannered Meryl, quite acceptable. But did they do some CGI to make her look taller? I usually like Amy Adams, but feel she was wasted in this movie. Stanley Tucci is incomparable, as usual.I couldn't figure the link between the Julia of the 1950s and the present day cook. Well I could really, but I didn't believe in it. I think it would have been more interesting as a straight biopic. At least the movie had the honesty to state that Julia Childs herself would have nothing to do with it. Well done!"
5,MmmMM!,"I bought this as a birthday gift for my mom, and she loved it! It's definitely a keeper that you can watch again and again!"
2,Slightly Overdone,"Started well, Streep as Child is fabulous, but the plot stalls over the last half as the movie loses its verve."
2,Irrepressibly Bad,"This movie is an unfortunate sign of the times we live in, where publishers and movie producers are more interested in finding a ready-made market for their work than making a work that's worthwhile. The only reason this got made was because the blogger had established an audience for her work.Really, give this a pass. No story, no character development, no plot - just like a blog.As much am I'm loathe to criticise Streep, that most talented and giving of actors, her elocution in this irritated me immensely. I know she gets a hard time for her accents and most of the time I think that's unfair - she is giving, after all, and not self-indulgent - however, when the accent is such a distraction it defeats the purpose. The voice she adopted in this made me want to not listen any more."
2,Slow & Boring,"2 hours of my life that I will never get back! I can relate with the character's unhappiness with her career and how having a project helped give meaning to her life. BUT, the movie itself was very slow!!! The only reason why I watched the whole movie was because it was the first movie my husband and I watched together in a long time (we have a toddler that takes up all our time)."
4,Charming,I love all thing French. I saw the movie at the cinema and it was a must have on cd. Great story.Exceptional acting. Meryl Streep was Julie Child personafied. The chemistry between Streep and Tucci was so believably real. Buy this. Even a husband will watch it.
5,Julie & Julia,"The website stated it was not released as yet and we were waiting about 10days for it's release. It shipped on time and the movie is great. My husband & I saw it ""at"" the movies and love it, but I think I will watch it again tonight!! Thanks!"
2,Should be just Julia,There are two stories - the story of Julia Childs and a story about some dumb blogger.The Julia Child's story stars Ms Streep and Mr Tucci and is great.The other story has a couple of unknowns who should remain unknown and is basically a waste of time - bad acting and a story not worth telling.If you watch this movie save time and fast forward through the non Streep scenes and enjoy the rest - you really won't be missing anything.
3,satisfied,Good movie. I bought it as a present for my wife. Only complaint is that there was a small puncture area on the front of the case. No damage to the disk. All is well.
3,Julia and Julie,It was a nice movie but not as funny as I thought it would be from the previews. But I bought three for gifts and added a Granny fork and box of popcorn and it made a nice girl gift.... men wouldn't enjoy this movie
5,Julie & Julia,Amy and Meryl are two of the best. I love the scene at the end at the Smith________ in DC. I have been there.
3,"More Julia Child, less Julie",Interesting movie. But Julia child was way more intersting. Not fun to see someone so self absorbed that she treats her husband so badly because of her blog readers and the stress of finishing this project.
3,Narcissistic,"Juli's husband says it in the movie and he's right - she sure is narcissistic and then some. I sensed before seeing the film, remembering the title of the book too - Julie and Julia - that it was going to be about her, Julie, with a ""dollop"" of Julia who should have been the main focus of the movie [i.e. Julia and Julie]. If you want to watch a self-involved person blog about herself and then watch her be surprised that Julia Child might not be happy with the ""poaching"" of her life and territory for Julie's own aggrandizement, well, then, enjoy the movie!!! I notice in the picture on the front of the DVD, Julie is represented with her finger in her mouth, looking like she's saying ""oops!' Yeah, the film is an ""oops!."""
2,Save Your Money!,"If you bought a copy of My Life in France for that special woman in your life, as I did, and she loved the book, think twice before you buy this movie for her. It was not the nostalgic walk down memory lane I had hoped for. Meryl Streep gives an extraordinary, delightfully warm portrayal of Julia Child, gourmet chef. However, the movie suffers from an unhappy juxtaposition of two unrelated lives from two different eras. Julia Child in France during the McCarthy era is fascinating in itself, but the movie viewer is repeatedly rammed out of this historical setting into the post 9/11 world of Julie Powell, frustrated New Yorker and blogger. Her working life in a tiny office cubicle contrasts sharply with the spacious, soaring views of Paris in Julia Child's life.If this movie was intended to be a comedy, there are too few laughs between the good scenes. There is a generous portion of obscene language throughout the script. This Half-a-Movie gets a half rating."
2,BlueRay Version,"The Movie is great!If you bought the blue ray to get the recipes they advertise, forget it. It's not there, The Sony movieIQ doesn't work. My blueray is connected to the internet, I can download/I have 2G of memory. The MovieIQ technology is a bomb. Sony is good at inventing things that Don't work or break."
1,"Vapid, Insipid, Skip it...","Amy Adam's character was so self absorbed it was completely annoying. I didn't even enjoy her character. Talk about narcissistic!Streep was over-the-top here, even though the best parts of the movie were with Streep and Tucci. I wished they had gone into it at the end just WHY Julia Child didn't like Julie.The writers killed it with the excessive jabs at Republicans. We already know Hollywood hates conservatives but is it really smart to alienate half of your paying audience by insulting them continually? It just comes off as childish and immature, like bullies at a playground."
3,Charming but too much lefty whining,"I generally enjoyed it, but there was too much political whining about the Red Scare (which, as historians now know, was not just paranoia). There's confusion about McCarthy and HUAC, I suspect, as is normal for Hollywood revisionism of this era. If it's as depicted, that's terrible, but the problem is that Hollywood has distorted this issue so much that my first reaction is skepticism. I don't know if people were questioned about their homosexual tendencies by HUAC, but I do know that it was McCarthy's enemies, including the liberal media, who were constanty gay-baiting during that time, while McCarthy staunchly defended his homosexual associates. (Didn't know that? Maybe you should find out that there's a whole other side of history that has been successfully hidden from you. I wish you the best on this journey.)Streep is wonderful as Julia; Adams is OK as the opportunistic Julie who gets famous."
5,Omg I loved this movie!!!!!!!!,"Meryl Streep is awesome! I love the outfits, I love the cooking, I love this movie. :)"
5,I could watch this everyday,a feel good movie and who doesnt love amy adams? What a great story. The husband will even watch it. Makes me hungry.
5,Excellent!,"One of my favorite movies! As a result of watching this movie several times, I also purchased the book ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" and have made several of the recipes."
5,got as gift,I got this as a birthday gift for a friend who is a great cook. He grew up watching Julia Childs with his mom and fell in love with cooking. My family has bennifitted from that love today. LOL My waist shows it too.
3,Streep Deserved Academy Award,"Streep was great, and so was Tucci. Could have done without the Julie part of the movie. Movie was okay, but would have been better if it was all about Julia Child. I am stunned that Meryl Streep got beat out by Sandra Bullock for the Academy Award. It wasn't even close. Bullock's performance was good in a standard sort of way, but unremarkable."
5,Inspiring -- and Romantic,"I absolutely loved this movie. I loved seeing a couple ""of a certain age"" in a committed marriage portrayed in a sensual, supportive, and romantic way.I loved Julia's spirit (and Meryl Streep's performance is definitely Oscar worthy -- perfect!).I loved the portrayal of Julie as a Gen Xer -- sort of uncertain about her future -- and the way she throws herself into the project.I've read both books that the movie is based on, and they of course have more details, but this is a wonderful wonderful film."
5,Worth every penny!,"This is one of my top 5 movies of 2009. It's delightful, joyous, and adult in a good way. The marriage and continued romance of Paul and Julia Child was remarkable in its depth. The bonus bon appetit bag was fabulous, just the right size for a round loaf of french bread and some great cheese! I bought 2 and gave one as a Christmas gift."
5,"Love and food, and love for food","A non-traditional romantic comedy, where you are taken into the life of Julie and Julia. Both women had a passion for food and both had their struggles in life. This movie has a fresh sense of humor and is absolutely worth watching with the rest of the family.If you like food, you'll like this movie."
4,Even losers can succeed...,"Interesting way of presenting the lives of two women, 50 years apart but facing similar problems in life. It was interesting to see the lifestyle of a foreign diplomat during the early 1950s (Julie). Likewise, it was funny to see a bored woman succeeding with her cooking challenge and blogging about it. I wouldn't recommend it for younger audiences because of its slow pace. I also hated the scene where they steam the lobster alive! Overall, a fun and interesting movie."
4,Julie and Julia,"Very good movie, especially for foodies and fans of Julia Child. Meryl Streep is really amazing, she absolutely channels Julia."
3,"Watch Julia, skip Julie","I think Amy Adams is a fine actress -- but this is -- and I wish it had been totally -- Julia Child's story. Julie Powell tried something that was -- OK, interesting, but also pretty self-indulgent. And maybe if I hadn't read that her new book is a tell-all about her now-failed marriage, I would be less opinionated. But then again...I wish Ephron, who is a terrific director, had chosen to make ""Julia Child in Paris"" and left Julie out of it. Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci are just out of this world and I would have loved to have seen a movie just about Julia and Paul -- if you've ever read not only this book, but the several bios of Mrs. Child, you'd know there is enough material for four hours, let alone two.More Meryl, more Julia!"
3,Half of a Good Movie,"This movie features an incredible performance from Meryl Streep. The Julia half of the film is interesting for that reason alone. The Julie half of the equation didn't work for me at all. She's self-centered, obsessive-compulsive, manipulative and somewhat of a whiner. There really was no connection between Julie and Julia except in the fantasy world of Julie. Towards the end of the movie we find out that Julia hates Julie, no doubt because Julie is exploiting her contrived psychic bond w/ Julia for fame and financial benefit. Check out the movie for Streep. That's all..."
2,Undercooked,"I saw this film at the cinema with my mum and was shocked when a certain 4 letter word appeared during the film. However, the swearing (granted it was only said once) was the least of the problems with the film.The cook, Julia, appeared drunk throughout the entire film - it was funny for about the first thiry minutes, but then it was just annoying. Added to this was the whimpering and odd behaviour of Julie and the movie just became boring and tiresome.Other reviewers have mentioned my last point, and I will too, there was too much focus on ""let's have sex"". The amount of references to sex in relation to the theme of the story was out of balance and unnecessary as it didn't add anything to the story.Give this one a miss and move on, it will only irritate you!"
5,funny movie,Meryl Streep was so good in this as Julia. She is such a good actress and she nailed Julia Childs. What an actress and what a great movie.
4,I LIKED IT; I LIKED IT,"Very enjoyable. Here are two comments:- Scriptwriter Ephron often has characters annoyingly repeat phrases, e.g., ""I will; I will."" ""OK; OK"", etc., etc.- Streep's imitation is excellent, but I wonder if Child used that affected high-pitch 100% of the time? Even in bed?"
5,Julie&Julia,"As always, I was very pleased with my purchase from Amazon. It arrived early and I had plenty of time to get them wrapped and into the Christmas stockings! We have enjoyed this movie several times now...."
2,misleading,"I think that it is completly awful that I buy a stated new dvd from movie mars and amazon.com and when the movie is received it has been returned twice and has a return to sender slip stuck to it as well as a destroy slip. Doesn't sound brand new. Also when the movie was opened no security stickers also finger prints all over the disk. Granted to blu ray played well but it was misleading to say the least. Makes me think twice about buying ""new"" item"
5,Julie and Julia DVD,"Got the DVD on time in great condition, no skips, no blips, perfect. Happy to have it will do business again with this seller. Recommend."
4,Wonderful!!!,"There is no other like Meryl Streep.. The story was wonderful and the actors all performed to perfection, especially, Julia !! Streep is an icon actress...."
4,Issues,"THe film was great - the price was great - the ease of purchase was great. I don't understand why a brand new DVD skips in the middle, so I had to return it. BUT - the return process was also great. It was a gift for my wife so disappointing that the DVD did not play... but apart from that buying from Amazon, as ALWAYS, was a pleasure!"
3,Julie & Julia,I was disappointed in this one. I didn't find this very entertaining. It didn't hold my interest and wasn't funny or amusing. I just didn't care for it and don't care to see it again.
3,A must have for Julia Child fans.,I've loved and admired Julia Child as far back as I can remember.She inspired me to cook and try new things. This movie may not be for everyone but true Julia fans should at least see it. Meryle Streep in unstopable in any part she plays. She really captured Julia Child.
2,Liberal Attack Machine,"If only they had edited out a minute of dialog, this tale of two women from different eras pursuing the same dream would rate 4 or 5 stars. But the movie's writers decided to pepper the script with swipes at conservatives, thus ruining what would have been a heartwarming story. For example, when Julie's day job supervisor reproaches her for calling in sick, he admonishes ""If I were a Republican, you would be fired"". And Julia's husband constantly complains about how Senator McCarthy interferes in his work. Enjoy the story, but filter out the propaganda."
2,One bad word ruined a good movie,"We were really enjoying this movied until Paul, Julia's husband used the ""F"" word. The movied was wonderful up to that point. It was not needed at all and we feel the only reason the producer put it in was to not get a ""G"" rating. Wake up producers; there is nothing wrong with ""G"" movies."
3,No Meg Ryan,"I thought the movie was excellent with one exception. Seeing the movie before reading either book, I certainly got the impression that Julie was depicted as a sweet, somewhat obsessed, Meg Ryan character. Didn't we all feel terrible that ""stuffed shirt"" Julia snubbed her? Could it be that Julia simply didn't want to be associated with someone that uses the ""F"" word in almost every sentence, not to mention other serious character flaws? Read Julia's book, avoid Julie's and see the movie in spite of this distortion."
1,Rather Dumb,"I am glad others liked the movie better than I...I thought it was a dumb movie. Meryl Streep is a great actress, and I really like her, but I didn't like the movie."
2,Great concept - poor execution,"If you want to watch whiny, privileged, generic white liberals talk while they stuff their mouths with food - then this movie is for you. Overly precious, self conscious, annoying. Comes complete with the cliched ""lunch date"" in which the idealistic, oh-so-cute protagonist realizes that her friends are all greedy, narcissistic phonies! She then goes home to complain to her hyper-supportive, eunuch of a boyfriend and a dream is born. Makes me wonder if the book is this bad."
4,Julie & Julia,I enjoyed this video very much. Merle Streep is great as always. I would recommend this movie to a friend.
2,"Two movies, one very good, the other ............","We have two movies here. One is a superbly-acted, well-scripted piece about a fascinating couple, one of whom is now deservedly a household name. The other is a sub-soap opera effort about a couple of nobodies and their straight-out-of-Cosmopolitan-short-stories friends, given lines that nobody in real life would utter unless that person watched too much daytime tv. I guess the film maker thought we wouldn't be interested in Julia Child unless her story was somehow linked to the kind of tv drivel that passes as entertainment today. It was just about worth sitting through all this for the Julia Child scenes. Child (Streep) and husband are as spectacularly good as the other two are spectacularly bad. Hopefully there will be a future dvd edition that will allow one-touch navigation through the movie, deleting everything involving the nobodies."
4,Great fun!,"I really enjoyed this movie. To be honest, I'd always found Julia Child's old shows to be really annoying, but I also didn't know anything about her life. I loved how they paralleled Julie's life to Julia's and the quirkiness of the film.I also really liked that the men in their lives were cast in such a great light. Too often 'chick flicks' make the men out to either be the beasts or this insignificant character. I like that they were shown as strong, loving men who supported their wives and were actively interested in what they were doing (okay, and maybe thought they were crazy too). That was a nice change of pace and felt a little more realistic to me.The story is adorable, the movie is a lot of fun. Both actresses did an amazing job with the characters. I wanted to hug Julie and I totally wanted to have a cocktail with Julia.Give it a watch... I think even my husband might enjoy this one!"
2,Should have been just about Julia . .,"I loved the Julia story - I so wish it would have been just all about Julia Child. I found nothing remotely likeable about the character of Julie, or her husband or her friends - but I did like her cat:) Cooking her way through a cookbook, Julia Child or not, was just not believable as life changing. And were we suppose to feel sorry for her in her 'dumpy' apartment? I thought it looked pretty good to me - just the whole story line of Julia was irritating.Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci were pure delight - I can only hope they do another movie - maybe covering the Child's war years together."
5,Great Movie !,"Great human interest story, two really. Throughly enjoyed it !Also very good service from the seller, quick delivery."
3,Lacked Focus,"I was looking forward to watching this movie because I love Amy Adams and Meryl Streep. After 30 minutes I could see that the movie wasn't really going in any particular direction, and it lacked focus. After an hour I couldn't watch any more I was so bored! I thought the plot IDEA was great and the actors were really good, but it was just so boring. Don't waste your time."
3,Not quite savoury enough.,"This film is, somehow, neither fish nor fowl.The premise isn't bad, and the Julia Child memoire portion has genuine bio-pic interest. Yet, overall, the script isn't strong enough to carry a two hour film, and the one-note point of the epic effort to make all of the recipes in a single year - itself rather admirable, and clearly an act that ends up being an homage to Ms. Child even if it didn't necessarily start that way - just doesn't have quite enough meat to it. The scenes in Paris make you want to go there. The sets are quite beautiful, as is the food. The script relies on many cliches. The dialogue is sometimes rather stiff. Meryl Streep's impression of Julia Child is a hoot at times, at other times somewhat forced.The film is informative. It is in some ways uplifting.In the hands of Neil Simon it could have been informative, uplifting, and funny."
1,worst movie,Never saw a movie with Merly Streep I didn't like ---guess what this is the worst movie I ever saw
1,julie and julia,could not down load this dvd no matter what I tried. the movie was probable great. I don't know.
1,"Very bad movie, Not Meryl Streep",I am a big fan of Meryl Streep but this is one bad movie. The story is very plain. Don't bother with this movie. Meryl Streep did a great job as always. The story of Julia Child should not have been made into a movie. Very very boring movie.
1,Scratched Disc,The seller sold me a DVD with a huge scratch on it and the movie wouldn't play all the way through.
3,Loved it...minus the politics,"This movie would have been a favorite of mine if it weren't for the political jabs throughout. The acting was great and the intertwining of there lives flowed nicely, but I found the leftist slant offensive. If I wanted to see a pro-Communistic movie I would have rented one by Michael Moore."
4,A brief respite from daily life.,"I haven't had the time to watch this DVD yet but from what I've seen and heard, I know I will like it. I am a long time admirer of both Julia Child and Meryl Streep and Amy Adams is fun to watch. I look forward to a break soon to enjoy this movie."
5,a big julia fan,Enjoyed the film so much in the theatre that I knew I had to own it.The Julia parts in particular are so joyful -- this is a real laugh-out-loud movie.
2,Not glad I watched it,"This movie was a miss for me although I usually like this director's films.The main character is not very likable and Julia Child is whitewashed to seem more likable than she was. That aside, the story is slow without much of a message.BTW, when the lobsters were boiled alive as a comedy bit, I was totally turned off. Lobsters actually feel incredible pain when cooked alive by a person too cowardly to show them mercy by killing them first! It is a complete myth that they do not feel the boiling water like we do. And I especially dislike filmmakers treating cruelty as humor without making it clear that this actually IS cruelty. This may seem like a small detail to some people, but it made me dread watching the rest of the film from that point on."
4,A delightful movie!,"I haven't read Julia Child's books, but watching this movie inspired me to stick it (and her DVDs) on my wish list. I received this as a Christmas present, and got to enjoy an uninterrupted viewing of it. There were a couple of points when I had to rewind a few seconds, to verify what I saw or what I heard. The acting was wonderful, all around. If one enjoys cooking shows, or has an intense love affair with one's food-loving spouse, this is a great movie to see. I'm very glad it's in my collection."
3,Half of a great movie...,"I found myself wanting to fast-forward through all the modern day parts so that I could watch Meryl Streep's brilliant performance. Amy Adams is a solid actress, but the character is incredibly difficult to like. She is written in as a whiny, narcissistic bitch. When contrasted with Streep's warm, humanizing interpretation of Child, you end up hating the one and loving the other."
5,Bon Appetit!,"For those of you who love to cook, this is an amazing movie. Meryl Streep is magnificant! And I like Amy Adams in almost every she's done- there's just something about her... Nora Ephron, the director/writer, does a fabulous job of bringing two very different worlds together. I highly recommend this movie, but be warned- I'm always hungry somewhere in the middle, so have a yummy snack handy!Alexandra Pauleywww.alexandrapauley.ws"
2,Sometimes Jams,Mine jams every once in while. Have reset it by powering it down (unplugging everything). Pain.
1,Defective KVM,"My setup: Windows 7 laptop and Windows XP desktopThis KVM-121 switch did not work for my Windows XP system. The mouse and keyboard and speakers was not recognized even though they worked before this setup.This KVM switch did work, but no audio, with the windows 7 with the ps2 to usb adaptor (for mouse and keyboard) and the monitor.I called the manufacturer, tech. couldn't resolve the problem, and did get a defect code from them so that I request refund from Circuit City. Circuit City promptly returned my money. So they are good to deal with as long as you provide proof that it was defective by going through the manufacturer first to try to resolve any issues.Also, I didn't like how the switch connections were. It made for a snake like mess under the desk. Wish the connections could be on one side and then back and have a button and indicator in the front. At least that way can mount to side (inside) of the desk."
3,Works.,"This switches keyboard, video, mouse, and audio. Or you can leave the audio alone and switch the rest.I use everything except the video. I like having one monitor per PC. The switching process is a bit slow.You can switch by tapping Scroll Lock twice then 1 for one computer or 2 for the other computer. Sometimes it goes brain-dead and I have to push a tiny push button on the box. The box is usually on the floor in a mess of cables.But it does what it says it does. I just didn't have room for 2 keyboards and having it switch audio as well is nice."
2,KVM Switch,"This one does the basics, that is, switches between one Desktop and another. This is the second one after I had to have the first one they sent me replaced because of a bad video signal on one channel. This one does has audio problems but I got tired of sending them back and forth to get exchanged."
3,A little fiddly,"I had another KVM without audio, and swapped it for this one. A few caveats:1. The audio connectors (mini-plugs) needed a little twisting & turning & pulling to get solid connections with both channels active.2. The ""auto sensing"" aspect is touchy, at least with respect to the mouse, i.e. the switch, and thus the PC, don't always ""lock-on"" to the mouse as needed. For example, for one of my computers I need to manually switch the input to that computer as I power-on in order to reliably detect the mouse, especially if PC #2 is on as well.3. It pays to read the manual! I like the scroll-scroll-number for switching just the KVM-not-audio, then I can hear when the other PC does something to notify me. Also Scroll-Scroll-M for reset is nice.Not bad though for the price, particularly once you understand its quirks and learn to work with-and-around them."
4,D-Link KVM,"This switch is great. I'm using it for one system running Vista and another running XP. When one system is powered down, it automatically switches to the other system... or you can simply push the button to switch between systems anytime."
3,Poor packaging,"The item is great, but the way they packaged it was HORRIBLE. They mailed it in a small envelope, folding it, causing 3 distinct creases. I emailed them and they did respond quickly with the advice to lay something heavy on it. I was pretty much already doing that. Anyway the creases were still there, but I wanted to see if when I applied it the creases could be smoothed out. They did not! I kept it assuming I could not return it since it was opened and used. Bottom line is that I will be very cautious about ordering from this company again."
4,"New, interesting, and enjoyable","I got Core Device's CD from MetalFest, with a bunch of other ones. This is the only one I still listen to, and I'm glad I paid alot more then it is offered here, but no biggie it's a great CD. So, if you want music that won't put you to sleep and maybe cause you to dreams some powerful dreams, Core Device is the best, period."
5,this is the future 2 triple 0,when you hear this record a new music dimension is coming up to everyone who likes future rock. you have to listen to this cd. just listen. it's amazing.
3,"Same Old, Same Old","This is very good, but, like Television City Dream, it is loud and fast without much in the way of catchy melodies or emotional urgency. Ben shows signs of progress in albums like Bark Like a Dog or Emo, only to again do warmed over versions of the music of his youth. The last great punk album by this band is How To Make Enemies: since then, Ben Weasel has shown that he is able to write great pop songs, but negative reactions from the dumb punk rockers he claimes to despise ensure that he returns over and over to this tired, weak and formulatic mindless psuedopunk."
3,it won't let me change my star rating. 4 stars.,"I reviewed this album a while ago and painted it in bad light. It's a very good album. The first two songs ""bottom of the 9th"" and ""gotta Girlfriend"" are some of the best Weasel songs put down on paper. I think it's the best one since ""Anthems"" I highly recommend.If you don't know who Screeching Weasel is check out, ""My brian hurts and ""anthems for a new tomorrow""cool"
2,Garden of What?,"A very disappointing record. Running to a little under 30 minutes, this is a *must have* only for the Oldfield, Ayers, or Bedford *completeist*.Not as random or as scattered musically as Bedford's *Nurses songs for elephants* but do not expect this to throw forward any gems by this usually impecable threesome.Buy it if you *need* it. Not to listen to."
4,"Good, solid instruction","While nothing can replace a good instructor in learning martial arts (there is more to learning any art than simply the mechanics of how to do the moves), this book does a good job in covering the basics of any good martial art; stretching, conditioning, strikes and kicks. In addition, it provides a good history of the Kara-ho system. The conditioning goes beyond warm up and provides effective exercises that enhance fighting performance. The strikes and kicks are presented in pratical terms of how they are used (application). The only I would have liked to see more of is the techniques of Kara-Ho which make it such a devastatingly effective martial art."
1,On This Book,"This may not be the best book, on telling you how to appropriately master this particular style of martial art, but it does have cute ka'imi kuoha, and her sexy feet, in it!......"
2,Not good quality,"My daughter just got this for her birthday, we opened it today and the door falls off it's hinge every time it's opened. The chair breaks when Barbie sits on it. The Barbie I wouldn't expect to be a higher quality Barbie but even that feels cheap (i.e. hair and filmy plastic) plus her clothes make her look a little cheap. Who cooks like that? Aside from that...my daughter loves it. Just a mom's thoughts..."
3,Big,This takes up alot of room. I found a graco one shortly after purchasing this one. Needless to say. I have got rid of this one.
5,Great toy,I got this for my 8 year old that still loves baby dolls. I can't get over how realistic and well made it is. The clasps even work the same way many real child seats do. Today I attended a baby shower. There were a bunch of toddlers milling around so I got this car seat and a baby doll out of my vehicle for the little ones. Huge hit! They were mesmerized and entertained for quite sometime. It is easy to buckle in and extremely secure. We now have a baby doll or stuffed toy along on every car ride.
5,Great Toy! Our family loves Joovy stuff!,"We have all the Joovy Just like mine doll items. My daughters love these things, I never thought buckling and un-buckling could be so fun.If you have been disappointed before in doll accessories quality try these products you will love them. The quality is unbelievable."
5,awesome,"bought for my 7 yo niece for christmas and she loved it, thought it was great that her american doll had its own booster seat! great product"
4,as described,"although i thought my 5 year old daughter would be in love with this item, i was wrong. it is very cute and as described but it is very much over priced."
4,Cute realistic toy,"I purchased this car seat for my daughter's birthday 9 months ago. It is great quality. It is sturdy and has withstood my daughter not only putting her dolls in it, but sitting in it herself. It comes with a metal clip that allows you to install it into the car. It actually helped encourage my daughter to sit in her car seat. Before we purchased it she hated sitting in the car seat (of course we still forced her to but it was a regular struggle) but I was able to use this seat to explain, and demonstrate (not buckling the doll in while we were driving and allowing her to see that the doll fell out and could have been injured) the importance of car seat safety. I would defintely recommend this product for play and as a teaching tool for sometimes stubborn toddlers."
2,OLD USB PORT,"I gave it 2 stars because the pictures are misleading, i bought it intended for my Coby kyros Tablet and it was a complete waste of money, Its not an Mini USB to USB adapter. For those that dont know what 5pin means, its the old type of square type of por that old keyboards used before..."
4,Great (but Not Perfect),"Easy to order. Received item promptly. Looked as good as expected, sylish. Compact. Lightweight. Only complaint would be that the zipper doesn't open wide enough to allow the cover to lie flat in the opened position (i.e. like you would want a book to do on a flat surface) making it somewhat difficult to flip through cd's (you must always have a free hand to mark the page). Otherwise, a good buy for the $$."
2,Cases fall apart after a year....,The product design is nice and I thought they were really well designed. I ordered about 20 of them for my CD collection. As I used them they started to fall apart. The handles broke...so you have to carry them with no handle. Then the black material they use on the outside of the cases started to flake apart and anytime it bumped into anything left a trail of black dust. Whatever material they are using looks good for a few months but after a year it falls apart. I tried to contact the company but never got any response. I would look for another alternative or else you will be left like me with broken handles and disintegrating black cases...
3,Pay attention to the '80 disc/80 covers' part.,"I didn't read the fine print, and thought that this was a 160 disc holder (that is, discs AND covers). It's not. If you want both, you can only put 80 discs in. Really a bummer. The product's pretty sturdy (I got the black one, not the suede finish) and classy looking, but, it seems misleading that it's listed as a 160 CD. (If you used all 160 slots, you wouldn't be able to see which CD it is, for 80 of them, since the black velvet pouch obscures most the cover.)"
5,Speak No Evil,"I have read many of her books, and have yet to read one yet I did not enjoy. Speak No Evil is no exception. Ir is well written, and I was suprised by the ending, enjoy."
4,Good utility for the price,The twin cupholder fit perfectly in the console well of my '91 Mercedes. The quality is as expected for the price and the expanding cup-holder and container features are a bonus - well thought out design. Would have been good to have the size dimensions prior to purchase so I could have confirmed that it would fit in the available space instead of leaving it up to luck.
3,Pretty good,This cup holder was exactly what I needed. I screwed it in to the floor of my car in the middle of the two front seat right on the hump. It served the purpose I bought it for. It's not the greatest quality but for the price I paid it did the trick. Pretty satisfied in the end. Plus I loved that it had a holder for something else in between the two cup holders.
3,It works...,"This will work on any center consol with the strap. If you have carpet and you try to drill holes into the floor carpet to secure, forget it. My only trouble is the '87 Ramcharger I put it into crashed the day after I bought it. Anybody want one cheap? Free?"
3,"does the job, cheaply made","this does the job for my 12 year old car which doesn't have cupholders although it's pretty cheaply made, but then again, it's pretty cheap. get what you pay for! wouldn't buy it for a nice, newer car but it works for what i need it for. and was easy to install."
2,Not teak,I should have read the details of the product. The wood is not teak. It has a teak colored finish. I'm using this in the shower. In less than a month the finish has begun to come off. Disappointing.
3,Teak Bench,I was lookng for a teak bench for my shower and this was an excellent price. The wood doesn't look like other teak benches I've had but it seems to be holding up quite well in the shower.
4,Not Kings X but...,If you liked Poundhound you'll like Supershine (both Doug Pinnick solo vehicles). The latter is heavier and more complex but less melodic. Thankfully Doug doesnt feel like he has to play guitar on this one and gratefully he sticks to bass. Its tasty in parts and should satisfy hardcore Kings X fans like me...however it is not Kings X. One listen should give you a real appreciation of Ty Tabors contributiion to the band when you hear this album. I am always suprised at the lack of funk influence on Dougs solo stuff. I expect to hear some of Tapehead on his solo albums but alas he stives for thunderous crunching straight ahead neometal. And thats ok. Hey its only rock and roll...but I like it.
5,King's X + Trouble = Supershine,"If you are a fan of either King's X or Trouble, then you must buy this album. For those unaware, Supershine consists of Doug Pinnick (of King's X) on vocals and bass, and Bruce Franklin (of Trouble) on guitars. Both drummers from King's X and Trouble play on this album, too.This album rocks hard !!! Harder than any King's X disc. At times they sound a lot like Black Sabbath, only with vocals that are a little more soulful. Bruce Franklin still has that nasty, doomy guitar sound that Trouble fans have grown to love.The only possible improvement I could mention is that there are very few background vocals. But Doug has such a great voice its hardly worth mentioning. If you like Sabbath or have always wished that King's X would get a little heavier, then you will like Supershine"
4,And many years later...,"...this recording still stands up. I am a HUGE King's X fan and a fan of most of the solo projects the band embarks on. I loved dUg's Poundhound project and Supershine is another favorite. It's definitely a different sound than King's X as most of the songs are written by Bruce Franklin of Trouble and it reflects his Black Sabbath-like guitar sound. dUg's vocals are definitely here, but the songs don't lend themselves to his more soulful style so recognizable on King's X stuff. In other words, the vocal performance is good here, but dUg doesn't necessarily take you to church here. Franklin's guitar solos are really good and there are lots of very listenable grooves here. If I had to use one word to describe this album, it would be ""thick."" There's not a song here that I skip over, and finding any record that you can listen to in its entirety is hard to do. I wish these guys would have done more than the one album. If you haven't heard it yet, it's not too late!"
4,Trouble & King's X side project,"Good album, not a great Trouble or King's X album but a conscious effort in mixing styles. It could have been a little heavier but that is just my opinion."
4,Shinin' On,"With the hiatus of Trouble after 1995, Bruce Franklin writes a few songs (and probably uses a few leftovers) and invites Doug Pinnick to sing on the album. What you get is a less metal, much groovier Trouble, with Doug's laid back soulful rock voice. Nice.I can't get enough of Bruce's (Trouble) guitar sound and playing and it's on display here, though a little thinner sounding.Doug's bass is way big in the mix, no need to add bass on the EQ! Thing is though, it's quite muddy. Pity.Some songs fall a bit flat, mainly due to a 'disinterested' (laid back) vocal from Doug, but the amount of groovy crunchy riffs and Bruce's cranking solos make this album for me."
3,King's X + Trouble = 70's Rock Made In 2000,"If you like King's X (Doug's voice in particular) and if you like Trouble (the Sabbath like riffs) you'll love this cd! Doug Pinnick is one of rock music's most revered vocalists and Bruce Franklin is the man behind the tone and riffs that has made Trouble a major influence on bands like Corrosion of Conformity and Metallica (James Hetfield has said that Bruce is one of his all time favorites). So, if what you're looking for is heavy - soulful - 70's sounding rock go for it you won't be disappointed!"
4,Walter Bella Farkas rocks the free world,"When I heard about this project (with Wally Farkas and Dug Pinnick) I was very excited. Farkas, from Galactic Cowboys and Pinnick, from King's X get together with the usual suspects from the south Texas music scene and just rip it up on this CD. One of my favorites of 2005, along with Ogre Tones by X."
3,A wonderful grunge CD.,"There are a few problems, unlike Alice In Chains, and Soundgarden, this band resemblence to very much, they had not focused on vocals, which if had could have made the album much better. Also, the lyrics, well, weren't the greatest in my oppinion. With all said, it was a minor dissapointment, though worth getting if you have some extra money."
2,All That Glitters...,"Disappointingly mundane considering the creative minds behind this operation are none other than Doug Pinnick of King's X and Bruce Franklin of Trouble; Supershine fails to live up to expectations. The CD feels as if both players are simply going through the motions with these half-hearted and uninspired songs. At best they sound like middling Corrosion of Conformity castoffs. However, the worst thing these fellows come up with, considering their innate talent is still better than half of what most other rockers could offer on their best days. Some of the tracks here are perfectly decent (""One Night"", ""Shinin' On"") but one is forced to wonder whether it was a lack of chemistry or effort on the part of Pinnick/Franklin team that led to this relatively poor showing for them and what they might have accomplished had they either clicked or tried."
3,It was a good idea in theory,"I am a big fan of Trouble and have always quite liked Kings X, so when I heard that this album was underway I was really exited. Until I heard it anyway. It's not that it's bad, it's just so mediocre. The combination of these artists could have been a great mixing of Trouble's Sabbath-esque doomy sound and atmosphere and Kings X's melody and harmony. Instead we're left with neither of these great sounds, but, rather, a puddle of mush. Bruce Franklin's guitars drone and Doug Pinnick's vocals wail, but in a lack-luster forgettable way. What a diappointment. On the bright side, rumour has it that Trouble are getting back together. Maybe King's X will put out a good album too and we can all just forget that this album happened."
5,Humor Helps When You're Taking Care of Toddlers,"My wife and I waited until our mid 30s to start a family. I read a ton of child care guides. Now I have a toddler and one more on the way, and this book is my favorite...because it's not so doggone serious. It's a very funny sequel (Keeping the Baby Alive came first), but it is not just a joke book. If you like wacky humor like David Letterman, Conan O'Brien, or a good Saturday Night Live sketch, you will love Keeping Your Toddler on Track till Mommy Gets Back. While you are laughing though, you will realize that there is substance behind the homor. That's the best part."
5,Many uses,Great multi-purpose stemware and it appears to be sturdy. They can be used as wine and water goblets plus function as dessert dishes. Just what I needed for a large gathering Christmas Day!
5,Best glassware ever!,"These water goblets are almost too good to be true. They look beautiful. They are heavy -- not going to break with an errant clink here or there -- and they wash beautifully in the dishwasher or by hand. They are equally appropriate with an elegant table setting or an everyday meal. The kids love them so much, they are drinking more water than before! And we like to use the goblets for serving water during club meetings or get-togethers. You can't beat the price, either. Nobody can believe how inexpensive they are, and I would not hesitate to buy another Libbey glassware product again! Thanks to the earlier reviewers who prompted me to give this set a try. I am so glad I did. I only wish I'd had them years sooner."
5,OMG!!! What a Bargin!,"THRILLED WITH THIS SET....came nicely packaged. The price was a STEAL! The glasses were heavy duty, simple, and pretty. At this price I might even let the kids use them ;)"
5,"solid, nice-looking glassware for a good price","I needed twenty glasses for a brunch and didn't want to spend a lot, so I bought several boxes of glasses at Ikea. Most of the glasses broke within a few months, and the ones that didn't break were so scratched up, I was embarrassed to put them out. I tried again with glasses from Pier 1 and had the same experience.I (finally) did some research and learned that these Libbey glasses are used by restaurants, so I knew they'd be tough. Sure enough, they've held up beautifully. Not one has broken and they still look like new. They also feel more substantial in the hand. We like the goblets so much, we bought two boxes of Libbey tumblers."
5,The best goblets!,I have been unable to find this particular goblet in finer stores. The weight and size are perfect. The stem is not to tall (tall stems increase the possiblity of them being knocked over accidently). Great item! Great price!
2,"Good Music, but TERRIBLE Lyrics","This band has a very good ear for music, but they could do without the very harsh and inappropriate lyrics. My favorite song of theirs is SOS. But hold off for buying this album until an edited version is published."
1,Not Hypnotized Anymore...,"If you have the album, don't bother with this single, unless you are a hard core BIG fan or collector. I bought this CD for the ""Hypnotize"" remix, but it's wack. It's a jungle mix by Tricky that completley misses the mark. While the original is a bangin' club song, you can't dance to the remix at all. I had a friend who was hard into drum'n'bass and jungle and even he said the remix was terrible. The radio mix and the club mix are almost identical to the original version and would only be good to DJs who need a clean version of the song, or a version they can more easily blend beats with. Everyone else, avoid, avoid, avoid."
2,Boring and not able to hold kids attention,The questions on the cards are not interesting to the children. They were not able to relate to some of the content and didn't get the point of the game.they became bored and lost interest quickly.i
5,Great game to promote discussion & fun,"I am a counselor and this is a great game and play therapy tool but could be used at home just for fun too, great for families. Questions are easy and fun and promote great discussions for all"
4,Good Counseling Tool,"I use this as an ice breaker with my youth clients or to get them talking once they clam up about an issue. It can be fun because they ask questions of me also. They are very durable also and rarely bend or tear as they are tossed about in my car, bag, office etc..."
4,Get kids talking with you,"I have the board game and I bought the cards to supplement what I already have. My children enjoy this game and I find that it is educational in that it teaches active listening, patience and understanding. No need for a game with electronics and noise...have your kids get in touch with their feelings and their own imaginations. You'd be surprised at the result."
5,Incorporating prehistory into political science,"Herbst provides a valuable contribution to political science in forcing the field to consider precolonial history as a determinant of state power. Unlike Europe, where interstate war led to strong state formation, in Africa geography and low population densities led to weak states. This fundamental development impacted colonial state building and eventually the state capacity of modern African countries. Hopefully, more scholars will consider deep history and its causes on modern politics."
1,Overbearing,"As a citizen from one of the countries in Africa, I found this book most overbearing. I confess I started to get prejudiced from the inception, when Herbst describes his arrival in the clouds, on the continent, and how he cast an eagle eye on us from the plane and began brooding about our fate. How godly!!! But I have learned to appreciate Western books on us as a portrayal of Western gaze, rather than a portrayal of our realities. As such, the book is interesting, although it reaches certain conclusions (decertifying states, dumping the Addis rules, all this under outside compulsion) that, given the current propensities of the American government, should be considered by any African patriot as extremely dangerous."
3,Ben,"I love blueman group... but How to be a Megastar Live was not as good as thier previous album. Same music, but different performers. The video and sound were great, but again, not as good as the first. Sorry Blueman Group.:("
4,Similar but w/ enough difference to buy,"Similar to the ""Rock Concert Tour"" this is still a great stand alone buy. The repeated stuff is given a new look and energy and the additions make this an enjoyable watch and listen. Well worth the $$"
3,Stunning... yet not the best,"I was excited to see a new DVD out from BMG.I was disappointed when the track list showed very little new material.It was good, please dont get me wrong, but If you have seen the original Complex Rock Tour, you have already seen the better of the two.The ""art""creation was interesting, and the band was top notch, but it fell a bit flat when background vocalist Adrian Hartley tried to emulate Annette Strean's lyric style on ""I feel love"" from the Original Complex DVD.If you were to buy only 1 DVD, get the first one.But most importantly, see them LIVE !!!!!I've been to see them in Boston, Chicago, and soon in Las Vegas....It is always a full on entertainment experience !!"
4,blue man group,was better than I expected..wanted cool visuals and sound for big screen/game room. I was afraid it was only going to be the three guys and get boring quickly but overall pretty good.
4,Awesome DVD,This DVD was awesome. I have never seen the Blue Man Group before but heard alot about them. The creativity of this group is very good. On a technical note the DVD looked great while playing on my Playstation 3 video game console. The seller was very prompt with the delivery.
3,How to be a Megastar(ouch),"It's OK. Not as good as I had hoped. I have seen other videos of Blueman, and they where better.It was of other live concerts. Not enough pounding, to much talking, and some real bad singing."
2,"Old Show, New Name.","Caught this on HDNET today. Watching it in HD was great, but its 99% the same as Complex Rock Tour. Venus Hum was replaced with some other lady. Song Arrangement was almost the same as well. The guy who sings Will You Sing Along and a few of the others is the same as last time. I won't waste my money on this, But I will tell me DVR to keep it around. I was hoping for a new show.. no luck. Although i will admit, the DVD concerts are NOTHING compared to seeing them at the permanent locations! Do it if you get the change, Their Permanent Emplacement shows are INCREDIBLE. Instead of being relegated to a ground floor stage, they build a entire complex of stages. ones very high up from the ground, etc to use some very large PVC instruments. I'd guess up to 30-50ft long. Resulting in very deep tones."
2,"Dissappointed, get the Complex DVD instead","Much of the same as the Complex DVD with a few extra songs, but inferior in every way. The stage production dragged at some parts, the guess singer was not on par with the ones in the Complex, and the band wasn't as good as the West Coast band; it may have just been the sound production (they were in an arena vice their sound stage for this one). I don't think any of the founding members were in this DVD.Overall, if you're looking for a Blue Man Group DVD, get the Complex DVD, you'll get more enjoyment out of it. If you have the Complex, don't get this, you'll be wasting your money. Going to give my copy to a friend. Final note, if you think you're getting a deal with the free CD, compare the list of singers on the Complex CD with this one and you'll see why this one is free."
2,"Lots of noise, saave your $$","I was really looking forward to this as I kinda enjoyed the original Blue-Man performance. I don't know if it's just that I'm getting tired of it, or if this really isn't as good, but I didn't care for it and I will soon be listing my Blu-Ray disk on ebay for resale. Someone might like it..."
1,save your money,"the complex tour is better, this one doesn't even rate, what a disapointment. I've seen the tour, I've seen them in Vegas, this isn't even close to the complex tour, the new broads suck, these blue men should turn in their blue badges,"
3,above average martial film,"The story line was basic the typical revenge, the characters were fair in their acting ability and the fight scenes were above average some trills. The training sequences were interesting and I liked the villian so 3 stars works for me not a bad movie."
3,"close, but no cigar","This video, while adequate, is not in the class of ""T'ai Chi Master."" There is far too much ""air fighting"" and too little ""ground fighting."" The sequences, while interesting, do not show the complexity of motion that constitutes T'ai Chi."
2,not so great tai chi movie,"The movie starts out with some real tai chi players then goes into standard martial arts. This isn't no Shaw brothers movie. Couple of the training sequences are ok but that's it. And most importantly, not much tai chi application at the last fight seen. If you are a novice, yeah get it."
2,Magnetic ABC's,The letters were too small and the magnets fall out of the letters. I would not buy these again nor would I recommend them to any one
1,New Sylvan Grandfather Clock,"This doesn't come close to any Grandfather clock that I have seen. The clock just like everything else that we buy is made in China and perhaps it is one of the cheapest Chinese made product!! It weighs less than 40 pounds and cheap material all away around. The weights and the chain do not serve any function, they are cheap decorations. The chime sounds like a sick cow!! The pendulum runs on a angle!! Be aware, You are not buying this from Amazon. com. It's sold by a different merchant and they do not return calls. If you order this you only have 30 minutes to cancel it with Amazon.com, otherwise you own it and the merchant will not refund your moeny. There are two other reviews on a similar clock and I was astonished to fond out the owner (I believe) of the company gives his own product a 5 star rating and the other review by a consumer indicates the clock is not made well and it does not fit properly. As they say, you get what you pay for!!!"
4,Football season,"I bought this to take to a SuperBowl party to give to the host, who is known for his chili (he makes 3 kinds, so another pot was a good idea) He was tickled to get a pot in the shape of a football, it was a cute novelty gift and very inexpensive."
5,Great for Football games,"This product is amazing. I bought it for my boyfriends father, He goes to football games all the time with it & its soooo easy to use & clean. its alot bigger then it looks too. It can hold alot of food. its perfect for tail gaters or bringing to a kids football game."
3,Did not get hot,"I hate to put this item down because it is cool looking but mine right out of the box did not heat up enough. I fact I was able to put water in it to check, After 1 hour on high I removed the lid and was able to put my hand in. The water was warm not hot. There is no way you could cook any thing in my unit. What made matters worse was the poor service I received. I paid $10 from Amazon back at the end of last March. We did not use it until The Super Bowl which was Yesterday Feb 3, Amazon could not do any thing, but after finally speaking to a Supervisor , they offered a return label and would give a refund which is not what I wanted , I wanted a working unit, So since it is still under warranty, I can send it to Select brands for repair but shipping will be at my expense. So the great $10 deal I got from amazon will now cost me an extra $15 to ship it out for repair."
5,A Pleasure Trove for the Eyes,"This is a fantastic book for film fans of the ""golden age"" as well as anyone interested in photography and the history of same as relates to the movie/film industry during this early period. The photos and illustrations will delight any fan or historian of that era of films, studios, and most especially, the stars. Highest recommendation for this for any fan's library."
1,"WOW, but no cigar.",It is obvious that Wambaugh can write. It is also obvious that Wambaugh is well qualified to write about cops. But even when the cops he writes about are supposed to be the heroes of the novel they still tend to be raunchy. And this is one of his more graphic novels. God help us all.
4,The Glitter Dome,"The Glitter Dome is a good way to start the Wambaugh adventure. More humor than The Choir Boys and less preaching than the latter. Laughs abound on nearly every page ending the story on a somber note. A delightful read which is episodic, easy to put down when the occasion requires it but easy to pick up later when the schedule allows. Wambaugh's character development and dialogue combine as his strong suit. Nicknames and physical characteristics are a very close second. Collectively, the characters dance before your eyes and tell their stories in a most delightful fashion."
3,Solid read,"Wambaugh is the master cop writer. His books have a sense of humour (without trying too hard to be funny), a mystery (maybe not his strongest suit) and a realistic feel to police life.This book gives us a glimpse at a number of characters but nothing indepth on any of them. I would have liked to have seen maybe a couple less characters and a little bit more about the main leads.A good book nevertheless."
1,"Worst book I've ever read, bar none","I actually threw this book out 40 pages in. I obviously can't speak for the rest of the book, but 40 pages in.. I had no idea what the book was about, what the plot was. It was just a bunch of rambling, that sounded like someone drunk wrote it. There were parts that were nonsensical.. I'd read back.. thinking I missed something, but nope. It just made no sense. I have never in my life thrown a book away once I started reading it, but there was just no point in continuing. It was a waste of my time."
1,Never shipped,The ladder was ordered on June 23rd. It was supposed to ship in one week. They keep sending emails that it's delayed. It's now July 27th and I've been forced to find it at another retailer.
2,meh,this light burnt out really fast. I wish it would last longer but what can you do. they wil evetually burn out
2,doesn't last!!!,we bought this mid August died first day of December! not even used daily!! That is not acceptable for a product!!
1,Annoyed with the purchase,I left a positive review about the light bulb for incredibly fast shipping before even testing it out and it saddens me to say that it did not work at all. I am very disappointed with this purchase.
2,TOO small,This light is too small to be of much use or to provide any substantial heat.I would suggest buying a larger light.
4,Heat Glo Infrared Bulbs - HEAT GLO INFRARED BULBS 50 WATT,The Light Bulb was nice but didn't give off enough heat to heat up the water for my turtle. I have her in a Glass 10 Gallon Tank with the top all open where you put the light bulb in the dome to heat the water. It throughs off heat but not enough to heat the water in this tank. I guess it would be better for a smaller tank.
3,Does The Trick,I use it to heat my snake. Works but does burn out fast. I have to buy around 6-7 a year.
1,exo-terra heat bulbs,exoterrra 150 watt daylight basking bulbs are junk buy them when local store doesnt have powersun. they last about a week no matter how careful u are with them longest was a month. absolute garbage!
5,heat lamp,Good....need higher wattage next time. Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good I'm not going to type Good four more times.What's with the required amount of words needed ANYway???
5,The Best CMA/RMA Study Guide,Dr. Moini has come through again for all of us preparing to take the CMA/RMA exam. With the addition of 4 more chapters he has covered all aspects of this important exam. I found it easy to read and retain what I learned. The mini exams at the end of each chapter are extremely helpful and the full exam is a fantastic study guide. I passed the CMA exam with a 99.5% and only used his book for a guide. I am currently working in a private practice and graduated. Thank you Dr. Moini for all of your hard work and dedication to your students and also those who are not as fortunate as I was to have you as a teacher and mentor.
5,Medical Assistance Review By Dr. Moini,"I am currently a medical assistant and I purchased this book and I love it. It is one of the best books that I have ever seen. The second edition of Dr. Moini is completed and easy to understand, especially the CD-ROM helps me to understand the whole professional of medical assistance and this book and the CD-ROM contains more than 2,000 multiple choice quetions. I want to personally say thank you to Dr. Moini. This second edition book without any hesitation I am recommending it to all medical assistance. If they want to pass the CMA or RMA exams they should buy this single book."
3,"Very nice optics, but too small","I guess my head is just too big. I really like the optics, for the price, they're hard to beat. Unfortunately, these frames are for a man with a much smaller head than mine. I have an 8 or 8 1/4 hat size, as a reference. I can still use them but not as fashionable as they could be if they were a little bigger."
1,Extremely Unhappy!,"I ordered these for my husband for our anniversary. I had already gotten him something and wanted to add these to his gift. They looked really nice in the picture and I liked them. The shipping was nice and fast. When I opened the box I was very unhappy. They looked like little kid glasses. They were tiny! They didn't even fit my head, they definitely didn't fit my husbands head. I realize they are pretty cheap but I at least expected them to fit his head! I would not recommend these for anybody with a normal sized head!"
2,Less than a month before they broke,"Bought these based on the review. Didn't last a month. Looked nice until they broke. Pass it up and spend more money, that's my plan next time"
2,Quite small for a normal sized head,"I second the opinions of others in that these glasses are quite small for a normal sized male head. The optics of the glasses are great and I desperately wanted to love them, but when I wore them, they were so tight to my face that my eyelashes brushed up against the lenses when I blinked. Very annoying!I ended up giving them to my wife who loves them."
2,"Decent quality, a bit small for my medium sized head, ugly logo.","Good quality polarized lens, as good as my 60$ Puma that I picked up at Costco a while ago. Frame looks good, good finish. The logo on the side looks U G L Y. The frame is a bit small for my head, makes me uncomfortable when worn for long. I am a medium frame guy with an average size head.Update after several months of use: The logo came off one side, so it looks uglier. Threw the set out."
2,Much too small for adult male,"Found these glasses by searching for ""men's sunglasses"". There was no indication of the actual size of the glasses in the product description. Upon receipt I was disappointed to discover that these glasses are VERY small; really only suitable for a child or perhaps a very petite woman. I couldn't even begin to wear them. So, unless you are looking for glasses for a child or are yourself a very tiny person, these glasses are not for you."
2,Size,"The Lenses have a good finished, but the size is very small, seems lenses for children, does not completely cover the visual area with the face of an adult."
3,Runs very small,Decent glasses but they run very small. They fit a children's or small womens head to give you an idea of size. The color of the lense is good though and helps when driving a boat and you need to see the shallow areas.
1,Not what I expected,I didn't like the sunglasses when they arrived. They didn't fit well and didn't look good on me. Especially for the price. Would not recommend them.
1,Don't waste your money,Very cheap plastic. The very first week of use one of the lenses popped out. You could do better at Walmart.
3,"OK for the price, but not durable","They did a good job of keeping the sun and glare out of my eyes when driving or playing sports outside. The comfort and quality was mediocre. After a few months use, the lens would start to occasionally pop out, and eventually the plastic frame broke when I dropped them on the sidewalk. Also, after a few hours wearing them, they started to pinch my ears/temples. I can't really argue with the price, but for my next pair, I might spend a little more for comfort and durability."
3,Pros and cons,I purchased these glasses to wear when I drive in hazy weather. They offer a great improvement in visual clarity which I enjoy. My challenge with these glasses is that they just are not that comfortable for me to wear. I need a wider frame with a little longer arm to be comfortable. The price/ value is otherwise hard to beat.
1,Breaks Breaks Breaks,Ordered 2 pairs... Amber and blackThe amber is BEAUTIFUL to see thru....Immediately ordered 2 more pairs....They all broke within a couple of weeks of light wearing...cheap plastic
4,Fine for a small face,"These are a little small but fine for me (5'3"" female). Don't get these if you are a large man!"
3,The lens has distortions,"The lens polarizes well but it has distortions resulting in ""funny vision"" as one eye sees in focus, and the other has a distorted view. Acceptable to wear for short periods of time. Very good in cutting glare from road spray and misty precipitation. Not good to wear for extended periods of time."
3,OK to Good,"The glasses are very inexpensive, but you might find the same quality at a lower price elsewhere. I thought these would compare to Bolle's, but I don't think they do."
5,polarized sunglasses,"I love these sunglasses, the price is great and the product is well worth it. I would recommend this to anyone."
3,"Functional, but flimsy.","Definitely polarized, and they fit *tight* onto your skull, so I'm fairly sure if you wore these jetskiing or even on a speedboat you'd never accidentally lose them. However, I do have some concern about the lens fitting; they flex in the socket, so I suspect a vigorous cleaning might dislodge your lens from the frame. That would be a fatal flaw. For the money, maybe you skip these and grab Panama Jacks at the drugstore.-C"
3,Kind of small,"I bought these since I was looking for something cheap, all-plastic, but still durable. I'm an F-16 maintainer, so I'm not very gentle with my stuff. Anyways, the sunglasses did seem to be durable, but they were way too small for my head. I even had my two troops try them on and they were still too small for either of them. I still wore them because of the fact I had already paid for them and I really needed the sunglasses. The glasses lasted about 2 weeks before the plastic frame around one of the lenses snapped while I had them in my cargo pocket walking around. These glasses would fill the need for a young teen or child's head and for someone who can baby their glasses."
3,Will keep thiese,They fit properly on the face but are tight around my ears. I have a small head and would not recommend them for other sized heads. The padded nose is very comfortable.
2,didn't fit well,hurts a bit behind ears... otherwise it was not too bad. You could probably buy something at a store where you can make sure it fits.
5,Great Price-Value relation,"They look great, polarized glasses make huge difference. I use them everiday for early driving and they keep reflections away, I used to have headaches due to my light eyes exposed to morning bright when driving to work, all that is gone!I bougth these and a Ray-Bans not polarized at the same time, and after trying both for a while, I preffer THIS ONE!"
2,Returned,"Had to return these sunglasses. They were as described, but once they arrived they looked as if they were a child's size. Did not fit me comfortably, so certainly wouldn't have fit my father well (they were intended for a gift to him)."
3,Good value/price Ratio,"This Sunglases are affordable, have a nice fit, great view but they don't seem as they are going to last for long time..."
3,nice but small & fragile,"I agree with most of the one star reviews but still giving it 3 star b/c sunglasses itself is good polarized value for the money.Two word of caution:1. It is very small, so your head size better be small. I think its ideal for youth or female head and not normal male size2. Its very weak/fragile. You can just break it by putting on the sunglasses with only one hand. Make sure you use both hands to put it on your head; especially if your head is normal or big.Mine broke after using it for less than 2 weeks. I crazy-glued mine together and using but... probably will save up for a bit more expensive one."
3,"Too country for me, but really good.","This music is way too country for my tastes, but I couldn't resist listening to a CD titled ""Every Man I Love Is Either Married, Gay, or Dead."" Keep in mind, however, that all country is too country for me. Most of the lyrics are hilarious, and Kacey has a great voice! When the songs get more serious, her voice soars without the annoying melodrama and screeching of self-titled ""divas."" Her voice is as real as the lyrics. If you like country, or irony, give this CD a listen!"
4,It's Not Tom Glavine or Greg Maddux,It's # 22 Mark Prior!!! It even says so on the box!!!! Don't know how they thought it was Glavine.....the Braves don't even have pin-stripped uniforms
3,Discovery Channel Filler,"The most annoying aspect of Discovery shows for me is they generally have too little facts to fill an hour. Consequently, they tag some inane teaser over and over again to keep us viewing. There are no shortage of interesting facts about Pompeii, so keep them coming. They displayed the lifestyle of the time in a very interesting fashion. It made it easy to make parallels to our own culture. It is still better than most history courses, as they are not afraid of telling it like it is..or was in terms of the Roman way of life and how they viewed sex, definition of classes, and their economy. It was worth the effort to view, but could of conveyed the information in 30 min."
3,Meh,This short documentary has a lot of fluff. The host doesn't really contribute all that much. There are some interesting facts and some redeeming value to watching it but it wasn't all that great.
3,Not the loudest Slade available,"Not a bad album, but if you 're looking for the madness of Slade, this is not the one.Nobody's Fools is more melodic, quiet and even melancholic...no stampin your feet here!If you're not familiar with Slade and heard they were crazeeee and Noddy was the strongest singer in the world, get ""Alive"", ""Old, new borrowed & blue"" or even a ""Best of""( ""Wall of Hits"").Still SLADE is example of good rockin' and partyin'!"
4,strange,a bit of a strange one this; in my opinion slade were trying too hard to please their american audience (this was recorded during their two-year stint in the u.s.) by toning-down the glam and the rock.even so still one of my faves; you can't fault a good song and jimmy lea has melodies by the bucket load....fave tracks of mine are l.a. jinx and all the world's a stage.
4,different but fun,i like this album quite alot and it really has a great 1970's feel to it and if you ever get to see the nobody's fool video youll love it. lets call it quits because all i can say is its a fun album
5,Awesome gift for wine lover friends,"I bought these towels as a gift for some friends who are really into wine. It's useless to try and buy them a bottle because they know so much more than me, but they LOVED these towels with all the information about chilling and pouring wine. Excellent."
5,The Bible of Maltese Cooking.,Claudia Caruana's book is the bible of Maltese cooking much neglected until now. It is a book for Maltese all over the world who need to be reminded of thier kitchen heritage. It is also an introduction to people worldwide who wish to experience THE TASTES OF MALTA.
2,Hocky Pucks,"We were less than satisfied with the Treacle Rings (Qaghaq tal-Ghasel). Despite following the directions to a tee, the filling was as hard as cement (my wooden spoon actually broke in it while stirring). The receipe should have called for a few quarts of water. The author may be world traveler and historian, but she didn't do her research on this particular recipe."
5,Great Resource! When is the New York version being released?,"Although I can only afford to use this resource occasionally,I have many friends who are already turning to this conscise, well written reference book on a frequent basis.Bravo Ms. Elias!"
2,"Makes your car dirtier, not clean and bright.","I sprayed this directly on my tires as the instructions state for the best shine....waited 3+ minutes for it to dry and drove off. The material did not dry completely and the tires spun the tire gel all over the quarter panels and doors and it is extremely difficult to get off...what a pain ! Additionally, the spray got all over the wheels, too, and then collected all of the brake dust making the tires ridiculously dirty !! I'm trying to make the care look nice...not add to my clean up and work. Did I mention how hard it is to remove ?? I had to use, literally, about 10 x the normal soap I would use to wash my car and had to empty and make a second batch ofsoapy water. NEVER again will I use this product."
4,1 person French Press,"I thought, being 4 cups, it would have been bigger. It makes what I would consider 2 cups. True size was my only disappointment. This type of item needs ounces measurement to pin point actual size."
3,A Nice Little French Press,"This is a pretty basic French press. If you are looking to make French press coffee that you will drink right away, this is perfect. For something that will keep the coffee hot until you drink it, glass is not the way to go as it does not insulate the coffee. ""Four cups"" is always a little deceiving with French presses, as a ""cup"" is measured as 8 ounces and the average cup of coffee is at least 12 ounces. This press is good for two people having 1 normal-size cup each."
2,3 Glass Beakers Later,"I purchased this Coffee Press, after using this type of Coffee Pot when I lived in the UK. Unfortunately, the quality of the beaker is lacking. In approximately 6 months, 3 glass beakers have broken. I have cared for these carefully, rinsing out with hot water before use, to warm the pot. The last beaker I bought, I heard a cracking noise as I poured a cup of coffee. When I removed beaker from frame/cage a piece broke away. Very dangerous, this could have happened with a full pot. Overall the quality is different from what I used the UK, so very disappointed."
4,Where is the 3rd edition? [Esp. updating global warming],"This second edition came out in 95, some 10 years after the first edition. By the preface's rationale, it is surely overdue for the third edition.However, for the undergrad, and perhaps too for the grad student in marine sciences, the bulk of this text should still be useful. It gives detailed explanations of marine ecosystems, and of their food chains. Key ideas like species diversity are explored at length. The text also looks at a very macro issue. The carbon cycle. In both aerobic and anoxic environments.On a very topical subject, the large scale effects of long term atmospheric changes are predicted. Remember that this was written in 95. With the recent onslaught of new observational evidence for global warming, this section of the book cries out for updating. In 95, some of the conclusions were justifiably tentative, being based only on what was then known. Perhaps the conclusions can now be restated and expanded with more assurance?"
3,Wimpier than a Fop Grant fillum,"OK, I'm being harsh as much of this book is good on its observations of America but the author's pining over his old girlfriend veers too far into Alan Alda sensitive man of the '70s areas. Don't get me wrong, it's worth picking up but it is not going to be up to most guys' cups of tea. After awhile you just want to yell, ""Shut up already and move on!"""
3,class,"I bought it for a class. It was in decent condition and the price was great. I am a big Northrop Frye fan, was excited to read more of his theories."
3,Stars from beyond,"I did enjoy this book and am glad I purchased it. It has been well researched and a lot of thought has gone into the text, although there are a few glaring omissions."
4,"Very Nice Book, But...","I really enjoy geography, and I love this book for its nicely done easy access to basic facts about all the world's countries. The book covers the ""Big Bang"" to E-Commerce while neglecting the fact that the ""Big Bang"" is only a theory and treating it as fact. (Shucks, God might have been a programmer and we really came into being through Philosophy's ""Black Box Theory"". :) It also fails to discuss ""Lifeboat Ethics"" and the ""J-curve"" or ""carrying capacity"". But, the book is overall an excellent and beautifully done resource. It is the first I reach for when I want to find out about a place.I would have given this book five stars except it fails to provide a quick reference to the worlds longest, largest, highest, deepest, rivers, mountains, lakes etc."
5,Nidhiki review,My son loves this bionicle. It combned with two other bionicles to make a giant Makuta. I would recommend it.
4,Cool little tool,"This flare is kinda tiny but it does a great job. It is battery-operated and completely safe to use. There's no open fire to worry about. If you push the button once it activates a flashing light and if you push it again you get a solid light, good for reading maps or looking for something in a darkened car."
3,"A great idea, but no so bright","It's always good to have a flare handy in your car for emergency. I was happy to see this reusable Flameless Flare powered by two AAA batteries. The pro is that it is flameless and it uses convenient size batteries. The con is it is not a bright as the regular flare. Another major problem is it easily lit up just by accidentally touching the button of the flare, result of a poor design. If you are going to keep it in your car, you definitely have to keep the batteries out to avoid accidental lighting up by the movement of the car; of course it also help to avoid normal battery drain.In general, it is good to have one like this in your car, you just have to make sure you always have a pair of fresh batteries along with it. You might need a few of them in the car since it is not so bright. Using a bunch of them is a way to compensate their dimness."
2,Semi-useful,"If you're familiar with the red flashing LED bicycle tailights seen on so many bikes these days, then you'll understand whan I say that this unit is essentially a one-LED version of those lights. Yes, it's visible from a good distance away, but only if you're directly behind it; the lens that focuses the light from the LED concentrates it over perhaps 10 degrees. The base has a magnet it it that will allow it to stand up on the roof of a car, assuming the roof is metal, which is still true for most cars. So as a road flare, it's better than nothing, but still nowhere near as visible as a traditional flare, or just putting on on your car's four-way emergency flashers.So what use it is? It might be useful as a rescue device, for signaling, or locating someone in the woods at night (if they had the presence of mind to bring it along with them). Given the low price, it might be worth experimenting with."
4,"Easy-to-use, battery operated emergency flare","This flare works with 2 AAA batteries and has a magnetic bottom that easily attaches to your vehicle's roof or hood and stays put. The flashing red light is very visible during day and night and makes your car/truck/boat/RV, etc. noticeable and also is helpful if your battery is dead and your hazard lights aren't functional. The reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that the light comes from only one side of the flare. It would be much more visible in all directions if the light came from all around. That said, keeping one or two of these in your vehicle would provide extra visibility in a situation where you need it."
3,"A nice light, but directional","This may be something that would be nice to have in your emergency pack, but it is small, toylike and not really functional as a ""flare"" The light that is generated is bright in both the flash and continous shine mode, but the light is directional. It projects basically in one direction as opposed to being a genuine flare style that projects in a 360 degree radius. For a carry-around for emergency use it would provide some help, but I think there are better flameless flares on the market that would work better. This is a lower cost item, so you may want to consider that when you make a comparison. I give it three out of 5 stars but I can't recommend it to anyone who may consider this to be a complete emergency flare solution."
1,Not A Safe Alternative!,"Oh, this is bad. What kind of light does one expect from two AAA batteries? If you want to be safe on the road, use real flares! In fact, you should have at least four flares in your car at all times. This flameless flare blinks or stays constant. It is barely distinguisable from 100 feet away. It cannot even be used to read instructions in the car. Maybe as a lightweight camping light to see where your tent is (if hung on your tent post), but even then, it's very low level lighting. Just buy some flares and a lightweight flashlight. This should not be used as a safety device for driving circumstances."
2,Calling this a flare is being awfully generous,"I thought this was surprisingly bright for a little LED, but I still don't think it's enough to stand out among all the other lights found around roads. The whole things glows slightly when it's on, but the beam where it's actually bright is extremely narrow, to the point where you'd have to be actively aiming it at people to get their attention. Many flashlights at the same price point would be much more effective, as well as being useful for other tasks."
2,Not a replacement for a road flare.,"This flasher has its uses, but it certainly is no replacement for a road flare. The flashing light is considerably dimmer, and is not visible in all directions. The magnetic base is convenient, but the light intensity (that of a good bike flasher) was a big disappointment. ""Flameless Flare"" this is not... Sorry."
1,May actually be worse than using nothing at all,"Poor quality safety products can actually be worse than nothing at all, as they can give a false sense of security. This LED flare is based on a good concept, however the execution is terrible! The light can only be seen in one direction and it isn't very bright. The magnet is so weak that a stiff breeze will dislodge the flare from whatever it is stuck to.Do NOT waste your money, and do NOT trust your safety to this."
3,May be useful but not as a replacement for a standard flare,"Having examined this, but not having needed to use it (knock on wood), it looks like it really isn't the most effective flare out there. The LED/battery was what made this interesting to me but it doesn't give off a significant amount of light. It appears it will beat not having one at all, but to honest it doesn't look like it will really deliver in an emergency situation. It's hard to rate something I haven't been able to put into play, so I'm giving the 'benefit of the doubt' to this item with a 3-star (average) rating."
3,"Caution, use with caution!","I must agree with all the previous reviewers who note that the actual output from this portable flameless flare is not that great. On the other hand, many people who do not want to carry full-sized flame-flares in their cars for whatever reason could certainly include this in either the glove-compartment or trunk because of its portability and mountability on the roof with the magnetized base. In pitch darkness, the flashing red beam is definitely better than nothing.Of course most cars these days already have emergency flashing red lights which run off the car battery, so that would be my first choice, with this little flare as a backup or supplement. There might also be some use for this item in campgrounds to identify your vehicle or tent while hiking in the dark."
3,Good product,"Good product for what its intended. I wouldn't use them on a busy highway, the lights might over power the illumination. But dark areas with low traffic they'll do fine."
2,not too bright...,"I'll be honest in saying that my car didn't break down so thankfully I haven't had to put this thing to actual, practical use. However from putting the batteries in and watching this flash, it doesn't seem to bright. I really doubt it's gonna work.Also it's plastic and could roll around on the ground if you're on the street.It also looks like it belongs in your bedroom drawer. Just sayin'"
2,"Poor quality, not a good alternative to regular flares","The CommuteMate Flameless Flare is not good replacement for regular flares. If you plan to go somewhere that might require a flare for emergency use, do not rely on the CommuteMate. It simply doesn't get bright enough to use in emergency situations. The flare is made of shiny plastic. Headlights could easily reflect off of the plastic and prevent people from noticing the blinking red light.The flare itself seems feeble and I can imagine it breaking somewhat easily. It's not rugged. I also tried taking the batteries out after my initial test and the second battery become stuck inside. I tried hitting it to get the battery out to no avail. I was worried that if I hit it too hard, it would break, so I just put the second battery back in.The idea of a flare that runs on batteries and can last up to 500 hours sounds attractive, but in this case it's not useful."
2,Tiny Red Blinking Flashlight. Flare? Hardly.,"This is a little red flashlight, period. Yes, the red light is bright, and yes, it blinks if you set it to do so. But this would NEVER take the place of a real flare under any circumstances.DO NOT buy this to replace the flares you should carry in your car emergency kit!!!!Most flashlights have the light beam coming straight out of the end of the tube. This one has the light coming off the side, like a beacon or lighthouse. It can ONLY be viewed from straight on! While a flare puts out intense light in all directions (like a sparkler) this little flashlight only puts out light in one direction - the direction you have faced the beam. DO NOT BUY, except as a toy, or as a hiking signal light - I have given it two stars for it being at least that useful.Flare? No way."
1,Piece of junk,"This was a real disappointment. It was too small to be effective, too dim and the light was so narrowly focused you could only see it from one narrow angle. I threw them away!"
2,Tiny Flare,"The Heininger 1020 CommuteMate Flameless Flare is basically a small LED light in the side of a cylinder. It either flashes or stays lit when not off. There is a magnet in the black end, which is also the battery cap by the way, so that it can be placed stably on a metalic surface.While it can be a nifty little gimick of a device I'd not go so far as to say it could really replace a road flare as an attention getting safty device. The light is small and would have to be seen almost directly straight on to make an impact and is not bright enough to be seen well in the daytime. Sure it will last longer than a flare, as most all LED lights would, but I don't think it would replace one.Now I do think I could convert it into a neuralizer for a Men In Black costume though. :-)"
2,Might be good at a rock concert,"There are definitely some advantages to this over a traditional flare. It will last much longer, and it has a magnetic base that is strong enough to hold it on a metal part of your car. The battery cap screws on and has a gasket in case it is raining. It is also compact and lightweight.The disadvantage is that it isn't anywhere near as bright as a flare. It has a single LED that is very directional. If it was placed on the road in front of a car it would be very easy to overlook.I think a folding triangle with reflective tape along with a couple of flares would be a safer alternative.Sean P. Logue, 2010"
3,Quite a bit of music here,"Over 50 songs spanning this guy's career. At times AMZAZING, other times FILLER. The top tracks are the by the following: Carter-Lewis, Wayne Gibson, The Kinks, First Gear, The Primitives, Nico, Les Fleur De Lys. I like the FREAKBEAT stuff he played on, and if that is your thing, there is enough on here to pick up, probably used. If I knew the ""blues"" stuff was gonna be on here, I probably wouldn't of bought it, because those ""jams"" get tedious and boring. To here the best solo Page HAS EVER done, track down the song ""Leave My Kitten Alone"" by FIRST GEAR. I think it has been on some compilations priced a bit lower. That is my favorite track on this. Oh yeah, Led Zep fans probably WOULD not like this. Nothing he did on this sounds like them."
3,You'd Better Be a Real Fan,"Of the guitarists of his time, Jimmy Page has to be one of the most overrated. Someone made a comparison to Hendrix which is a real joke as Hendrix who had more skill in his little finger on his right hand. His mates Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, and even Keith Richards could outplay him on a bad night. His genius lay in the creation of the New Yardbirds, aka Led Zepplin and his ability to get underaged groupies to do weird things. He was a solid and dependable player but there is little here that merits a second listen."
4,An Apple for Adams,"A good addition to other recent work on John Adams. James Grant, an accomplished financial observer, writes in an engaging manner and tells the story of this founding father with emphasis--unsurprisingly-- being placed on Adams' diplomatic work in securing loans in Europe during the Revolution.While the book captures the essence of Adams, I find fault with the author passing lightly over some very notable achievements of our second president. For example, President Adams' greatest gift to the future of American jurisprudence was the appointment of John Marshall as chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. This event is covered in one sentence in Grant's book."
5,Excellent biography,"James Grant provides a refreshing new analysis of John Adams that captures his role in the revolution accurately. Adams developed as his own party throughout the years following the revolution. This book can truly stand on its own and covers all the years of Adams life. From his law days in Boston, to the drafting of the Massachusetts constitution to his years as a diplomat in Europe the early years are well covered. The second half looks closer at his time in high political office from vice presidency to presidency to the retirement years. Overall it tracks closely the integral characters of his life. From Abigail to John Quincy to Alexander Hamilton the author develops each well and shows how they impacted John Adams. The one drawback is there are a lot of modern references which are not needed however they are not enough to knock a full star off. If you want a new perspective on John Adams this is a great way to go."
1,Hoop Dance Dissapointment,"I was really looking forward to this DVD. I had bought a weighted hoop at Target which came with its own hooping DVD by Gaiam. I thought this one would be so much better since Diana Lopez teaches at the Ojai spa in California. I was expecting a whole hooping routine that I could work out to. It claims I will get fit, yet it only had a step by step instructional lesson. It does not then take what you have learned and create a workout routine from it. Instead, there is a long drawn out video of her and her fellow hoopers hooping in different locations including with fire. It was such a waste of money. Go and buy the Hoopnotica dvd instead!"
1,No FUsion NO dance,"I was so excited to purchase this hoop DVD until I received it and viewed it. WOW, I waisted my money. I do not recommend this DVD; save your hard earned money. The warm ups were longer than the lessons. The lessons are short, lack of technique and uninspiring. I was so sad. Just save your money. There isn't any dancing, no tricks, bad background music."
4,Very Inspirational yet not complete,"I found this book to be very inspirational. It does have a lot of good information that is presented at a level that's great for those who are just getting started in the invention business. Having an encouraging book is very useful. My only concern is that the book is lacking in detail. I still strongly recommend it, and also recommend ""From Concept to Market"", which is a little more tempered in mood but provides a great deal of detailed information including a lot of sample forms and documents that are merely referred to in this book. The two make an excellent combination."
3,Have an idea... might travel!,"Would recommend, with a caveat - more of a guidebook best used along the way than an intro primer to licensing ideas / inventions. BUT - I've never done one so what do I know.Very detailed, some great bits of information here and there, especially the soft-skilled side of things that some might not be aware of (selling, marketing, communication, etc... yes, it is part of this game, too!). He did push his own services a few times - not enough to bother and heck... it's HIS book.Check it out, but don't expect a ton to stick the 1st time through.Oh and please skip the audiobook... the narration was very, very uneventful - and not a great match for this rather dense subject matter."
1,It's very teeny!,"If I wasn't so lazy I would return this thing but that would require a trip to the post office which is always packed in my town despite the fact that, as reported on Seinfeld, no one really needs mail anymore. Anyway, the problem is the advertised ""3 cups"" size must refer to those little china teacups or maybe 3 teacups used in a child's play tea set. In real life this thing barely fills a single regular size mug. A grown man can hold it with a thumb on the bottom and an index finger on top. I guess it does get a laugh from visitors because it looks like a surrealist replication of a normal size French press. However, the visitors stop laughing when they realize there is no tea or coffee left for them. In short, it's too small to be of practical use."
2,Dated,"I suppose you can get one or two useful ideas from this book, but mostly it's very basic, and also quite dated information. There is practically nothing here on internet research either quantitative or qualitative. This may have been an ok book for the novice 10 years ago, but not today. Better to save your money.Tom AndersonAnderson Analytics, LLC"
3,denny tries it again without cass,denny doherty sings the songs of the mamas and papas in good spirits. the only thing lacking is the late mama cass. but denny doe's this with style now is the time to release the whole mamas and papas cass elliot/ denny doherty back catalogue on to cd.......well done denny
3,Nice tables but nothing to write home about,"These tables are nice looking, and relatively easy to put together. If you can operate a screw driver, you can do it less than an hour. The color is nice and rich, however the finish is not perfect in some spots. The fit of the pieces is reasonable but not perfect - there is some space between the side trim pieces and the tops, for instance. Overall the tables are quite serviceable and a reasonable cost, but they will not be mistaken for high-end furniture. I was very disappointed in the packaging - like so much RTA furniture, it was packed in styofoam and therefore covered with teeny pieces that had to be picked and cleaned off the wood. Then the work surface is also covered in foam crumbs, and the garbage can is full of styrofoam because it is not recyclable in my area. Yuck. Wish they would pack in something less environmentally disastrous."
1,GOOD MOVIE - LOUSY DVD,"Again a good movie has been issued on a lousy dvd. Not only is the picture quality less than many vhs tapes, but they falsely advertise a full-length commentary by Kathleen Quinlan, the star, which is non-existant. There is an interview with her, separate from the film. This is a movie which deserves better, and this is just the rotten, greedy kind of job which is going to ruin the dvd industry eventually. How the morons who take part in this sort of product can live with themselves is above and beyond me."
2,"If you've read the book, you'll be disappointed in the movie","...and even more disappointed in the DVD.This movie was pretty bad. Several characters in the book were mixed up in the movie. I don't know if this was done intentionally, or if they just screwed up. The timeline was also way off in the movie. I won't go so far as to say the movie sucks, but it was definitely a horrible adaptation. And the quality of the DVD is even worse."
3,Seems very dated,"Kathleen Quinlan is a great actress, first saw her in ""Lifeguard"". The movie itself the premise, isn't bad, think ""pre""-Girl Interupted, but it gets really hard to follow at times, with her flashbacks, due to her voices, and schizophrenia. I would only recommend this to people that like dated, spooky, eery feeling movies, not one of my faves, but it was interesting."
4,Quick to receive and easy to install & use,Received the order in 2 business days. The installation was straightforward and the product has been working great so far.Two Thumbs Up!
2,Show Shipping...,"This is a great product, but I could have gotten it anywhere else... and had I known how long it was going to take it to be shipped to me, I would have. Well, that's not exactly fair, either. I was told there would be a delay, but I wasn't clued in as to how long it would be."
1,Eh?,"I don't get it. Unless this really IS a children's book it makes no sense at all. It is trite, repetitive and utterly tedious. If I hadn't read the other reviews and been something of a Wharton fan I would have junked it after twenty pages. The puerile `philosophy' may be compelling to eleven-year-olds, but from the book's rambling style and clumsy reliance on typographical devices it might well have been written by one. I struggled to the end, in dwindling hope of finding what others had valued. It wasn't there, and those first twenty pages were pretty much as good as it got."
2,"Baby come, yo zali, bana and my sweet lord","Hi! I love Makoma music even in Lingala or English because I speak both and becouse they are the contry with me. I like Nzambe na Bolingo, etc... any I wicht I WILL sing like nathalai makoma. thanks bye..."
4,The color is absolutely stunning!,"Everyone stares at these babies when I wear them! The only part I don't like is when the earring gets twisted, so I'm constantly making sure they're facing the right way. Other than that little problem, these things are FAB!"
5,Unforgiving Tides and Sole Survivor a great pair,"Fresh out of medical school, author Dr. Ross Pennie volunteers to serve as a doctor on a remote island in the South Pacific. In short order, he does his first appendectomy during an earthquake, amputates a woman's leg with a hacksaw and turns the makeshift hospital into a tavern to treat alcohol poisoning victims. Through it all, Dr. Pennie performs admirably in the face of much adversity. He also saves the lives of countless children by developing an inexpensive yet nutritious formula for malnourished children. This is an absolutely fascinating read and I recommend it most highly.Another book well worth a read is Sole Survivor, recounting the exploits of Navy Seals in Afghanistan. Both biographical books relate stories of heroism and of individuals giving so much of themselves to make a difference for other people. I suggest giving both these books a read; you'll be glad you did!"
2,Not good quality,Twisting the tightening screws the base of this cracked. Pieced dont line up right and holes are in the wrong spot. I would consider a different item.. If this was bought local it would be returned but its to hard to repackage so im stuck with a wobbly item.
3,"GOOD CABINET, TERRIBLE DIRECTIONS","I gave this three stars because once the cabinet is put together it is a very good looking piece of furniture.This was listed by Powell as ""designed in the USA"", made in China---they should have written the directions in the USA!! My husband who is handyman and techno savvy almost went crazy trying to read these directions. Nowhere did they mention that you have to use glue to keep some of these parts together, also the way it was illustrated was insane-- I printed a picture of this cabinet from the web site, front and back to make it easier to understand the directions."
2,Powell Cabinet Table,The table was very hard to put together and a piece of it was cracked.Did not want to go to the trouble of sending it back.
1,WARNING: Drawers are FAKE!,"If you were thinking this would be a nice piece of furniture to organize small items, think again. It looks like there are three small drawers on the right side, but this is really a door to a single compartment. This is a fraud, if you ask me. You don't need three drawer pulls to open one door! The only reason they're there is to deceive you into buying something that is much less useful than it appears to be. I am so upset about this I don't know whether to return it or not. $180 is a lot of money for a sham!"
2,Mission Oak End Table,The material is fine but once you put the table together it is not stable enough due to not using screws anad nuts.
1,DO NOT PURCHASE - very unhappy,"I received this table and it did not come with instructions for assembly. I used the paperwork inside to try and get the instructions, and I have not even had a reply from the company. It was a total waste of money. All I need is a piece of paper with the assembly instructions, not like I wanted to return it, you cannot return it after opening the box, it was completely ripped open trying to find the instructions. Very upsetting, waste of money, and no real support from the company."
1,Worst Item I Have Bought in Amazon,"Buyers beware! I wish I had read all the bad reviews for this item before I bought it. Just like it is stated by other reviewers, the assembly instructions for the table are very confusing and deficient. I had to rely on my intuition and sense of logic to put it together. Once assembled the table felt and looked cheap and flimsy. Not more than a month after I loaded it with a fraction of my collection of magazines (about 40 issues from Scientific American and Times magazines) the table collapsed into a pile of badly constructed parts. This is without a doubt the worst item that I have bought in Amazon. Don't waste your money or efforts on this piece of shabby workmanship."
4,Terrific value!,"Exceeded my expectations. Assembly is complicated and diagrams are confusing, so it helped to have had previous assembly experience. Regarding previous reviewers who said this is wobbly, they probably did not properly install the cam bolts and cam locks. Mine is sturdy as can be and looks as good as tables I have seen in furniture stores for over $500, so it was definitely worth the 3 hours it took to assemble."
4,Season of the Sand Blossoms: A Desert Wildflowers Journey,Beautiful photography. DVD includes a lovely virtual tour of the southwest deserts in bloom set to music. The second item on the DVD is a well narrated story about the southwest desert phenomena of wildflower blooms. Focus is the Mohave Desert.
4,Now I've seen some American Desert Flowers,"This DVD is quite a delightful field presentation of Desert Flowers in USA conducted by a Botanist from California and guests. The Music is nice and cheery.There are 3 Sections...the 3rd is my favorite (Desert Gold) Nicely narrated_relaxing and interesting.To Americans ""your desert flowers are lovely"".....I know ours are beautiful in Australia but I love your Californian Poppies and the Mexican ones too."
4,Like Best in Show - but for Pug Lovers!,"Saw this about a year ago at the NYC premiere, and loved it! A mockumentary similar in design to Best in Breed, Pugumentary follows the story of a man in NYC who died, leaving behind a huge number of pugs (22 to be exact.) The camera crew interviews neighbors, doctors and a pug rescue group involved in the situation to try to find out more about who the man (named Stanley Sloan) was, and why/how he had managed to take care of so many of these dogs. Written with subtle humor, Pugumentary actually goes into some background information regarding pugs in general, and the psychology of people who love their dogs like family (and more than family, in some cases!) Would love to get this on DVD - it's the perfect gift for a pug lover!"
5,A first-order tribute!,"Agustín Barrios ""El Indio Mangore"" at last received a web deserved homage from one of the most prominent guitarist of the last Century, John Williams whose profound love for every one of these pieces results more than obvious, at the monet you listen the first bar.As a matter of fact, Williams plays with astonishing Latin taste; which demonstrates his grade of conviction and commitment respect this poet - composer.To my view (in case I was inquired for the best piece) I would choose "" Sueño en la floresta"" hovered by a dark poetry of unsuspected lyric flight.Piece by piece, a masterwork, all the way!"
5,So mellow!,"I heard this music on FM radio and enjoyed the soothing sounds so much that I ordered two of John William's CD's right away. He's an amazing and skilled classical guitarist. This CD is my favourite, but I also really love Places Between where Williams plays with John Etheridge, live in Dublin. It's great as background music for entertaining or just being inspired."
2,gooming Poodles 1,"After watching this video I wondered why I bought it and wished it were returnable. The demo dogs have already been pre-groomed so you won't learn anything there. You have to buy the ""Basic Dog Grooming"" DVD which is also overpriced. Don't waste your money."
1,Very Very Very BAD SELLER!!!!!,"I did not rate this item because I never received it...I received a completely different item than the one I purchased....what a disappointment....this seller has not even contacted me after I wrote them an e-mail, they have not apologized or tried to even fix the problem. If you expect to get what you ordered from this seller....GoodBooks.....you will obviously NOT!!!! Don't waste your time....."
2,..more streching,"this video is a exellent overview of disney's musical talents featuring ""the magic years"" what does that mean? If this isn't streching it I don'tknow what is. ""the early years at leats made some sense and another questuionis why? This video is short and not really fufilling I suggest that the full movies should be bought because this is not fufilling and obviously another attempt to sellmore meaning less videos see the classic they are great"
1,Very Poor Quality for a DVD,"I expected excellent image and beautifully composed music, instead got a video tape quality image and music very badly composed.The price does not compensate for such a low quality work. Instead I recommend spending more money buying another title.The only reason to buy this title is to find out if your DVD actually works."
1,Experience The Deep,For the love of god! Do not purchase this dvd. It is awful!!! It has no educational or entertainment value! The sound and video is crap! I would give anything to go back in time to get the money I wasted on this damn video. Learn from my mistake! Don't buy anything from Madacy Entertainment! Anyone who recommends this dvd must work for these guys.
3,Good for kids,"I try to spend at least a few hours a week taking pictures of fish, and bought this DVD so my child - who's not yet swimming, let alone underwater - could see what sort of stuff is ""down there."" The quality of the video and audio is definitely nothing extraordinary, but the subject matter is fine, the price was right, and I'd rather have my kid watching real live fish than cartoons. Of course, I had to point out which species are, and aren't, found where we live."
5,Very Good,"This is an excellent choice, Steve is on one of his best performances, also there is nothing else available, I wish I could find something from the Seventies, this concert is from the Eighties..."
4,Region 2: buyer beware!!!,"even the packaging description is confusing. done in the early '80's. the band is tight and the arrangements are original and good. Steve appears somewhat distracted in first quarter of the set. other than that, it's pretty good. on the other hand, there's not that much material out there, is there?"
4,great CD,"This is mostly a recompilation of two earlier books, ""Surely you're joking Mr. Feynman"", and ""What do you care what other people think?"" with a bit of new material. The CD with Feynman telling the stories himself is itself worth the price of the book, even if you have the other two already."
4,Light reading,"For a biography about a quantum scientist, this was very entertaining and not too technical. What a character!"
3,Interesting to see other attempt VH,"Even though this complication wasn't as good as i expected, it was very interesting too see how other artists sang and played Van Halen tunes, if you want to hear it for free go to www.classicvanhalen.com where you can dl it, then decide if you want to buy it or not."
1,"stick to your day jobs, please","Good Lord, I'm surprised assjack Eddie hasn't sued for the utter embarrassment this is for practically everyone involved with this project. To each their own, I suppose, but between the negative reviews (thanks for the heads-ups) and the sampling of the songs, I know well enough to stay away from purchasing. For non-straight reading of a VH song that's worth some time, check Lee and the Press-On Nails' swing version of ""Hot for Teacher."" That one's a tribute, not just some carbon-clone cover that all the songs on LITTLE GUITARS are."
2,You will not lose anyhting if you don't buy this....,"I usually despise tribute albums, but once in a while I check them to see if some version of a beloved song by one of your favorite rock artists receives a new spin, a new touch.In this case, nothing hapenned. Bob Kulick Tribute Enterprises delivered a perfunctory tribute album, where all the songs seem exactly like their original versions. Useless."
3,Sophie's Attic - Robin Elliott,"DESCRIPTION FROM BACK COVERSOMEONE TO WATCH OVER MESophie Clarkson's beloved father had been gunned down in the line of duty. And when she became the killer's next target, her only protection came in the form of a ruggedly handsome, embittered agent - a man whose strong arms and rough edges made her feel safe ... but whose seductive kisses put her in a very different kind of danger ... For agent Tyson MacDonald, keeping a close eye on Sophie was easy - keeping his hands off of her curvy body was another story. If he had to lie, cheat, and steal to keep her from harm, he'd do it. But when she found out that he'd betrayed her, there would be hell to pay ... and the love of a woman to lose..."
3,Decent Package,The lenses and minipod were cool but the tripod sucked. It was cheap and not good for pretty much any location. And it falls apart. But if you want everything else in the package then go for it.
4,Egg-shaped wheels won't help a skittish kid.,"I bought this scooter my son a couple of years ago when he was still nervous about using two-wheeled scooters. I thought maybe this would have more stability and give him confidence.It's a cute scooter, well-built, attractive. There's a kick stand to keep it upright when parked, and it folds up. The handlebar height can be adjusted easily.Many children have tried it out and had fun. My son was too skittish, though. The egg-shaped wheels did not provide enough stability, in his opinion.For children like mine who need the reassurance of three wheels and some practice with balance, I suggest the Micro Mini Scooter. That scooter has the support of three wheels, but it steers like a skateboard, teaching balance. Otherwise, this is a good scooter."
3,Down Street Down Beat,"Hmmm. What can i say about it? prince of the south? i dont think so ""MYSTIKAL"" you have been in the game for 12 years now this is your greatest hits!??!!?Terror Squad had better songs on *True Story* than you have on your *GREATEST HITS* but ifyour a mystikal fan you should by it if you like his songs see, my friend is a fan of his and he enjoyed the c.d. very well but here if your a mystikal fan buy it if your not dont simple as that end of story peace out people!"
3,Mystikal has very loud voice .,"Mystikal has very loud voice . its works very well for him. Good tracks like jump,Murder 2 and shake ya ass. His album get 3 out 5."
5,So glad I accepted...,"Some friends and I were walking around downtown at lunchtime, when some people were handing out FREE CD's.I politely almost refused, but thought why not? I am so very glad I took that CD.It is really really good."
4,Great value,"The phone fit immediately onto my existing modular wall jack. The sound quality is fine and for the price I would say it is an excellent value. The color, black and silver matches my appliances - black and stainless. My wife likes the fact it is very lightweight."
2,The Emperor in drag?,"I can't deal with an Emperor that looks like he's come in from a spoof of a Shakespeare play. He looks like a Queen with a beard - yeah - the Bearded Lady! Some of the cards are nice, but I'm truly not impressed."
3,I'm with Jeanette strand on this...,"I agree with the reviewer, Jeanette strand of Sweden (see below). Her's is one of the fairest reviews I've read for this deck. I guess it's one of those you have to see to believe."
4,Brenthaven pack,"For being as large as it is you would expect that it would have enough room for most anything, but it's relatively slim, so although you ""can"" stuff a sweater into the main (not laptop) compartment, it's pretty much stuffed. That said, the bag seems to expand as needed, and protects the 17""MBP well. It fits on my shoulders well too, and I like that it keeps the strappage to a minimum."
4,Nice backpack,"PROS:-It's large, relatively comfortable, with more pockets than a single person would likely ever need.CONS:-A rather ""vanilla"" appearance for a $100+ bag, though, I'm glad it was cheaper at Amazon because I wouldn't have paid what other online retailers were asking. I even had trouble justifying Amazon's price, but I needed a good, proven bag for my laptop and there aren't many in this price range.ETC:-I should have looked at the measurements before purchasing... it's gigantic. Somewhat awkward looking."
5,Best computer bag I've ever owned!,"This bag is a perfect fit for the MacBook Pros, both 15 and 17"". There's a 2 inch cushion block that goes in the bottom for the 15"", or comes out for the 17"". It's comfortable to wear on your shoulder, and holds more than I have to put in it. I have the Macbook Pro 17', a mouse, a few cables, a few spare blank DVD-R's and CD-R's, my digital camera, spare memory cards, USB thumb drives, pens, power adapter for the computer, portable power strip, a couple magazines, etc. and I still have plenty of room for more stuff!"
3,NOT FOR LARGE AMOUNTS OF FOOD!,"It just buckles under such a small amount of pressure. Sorry for yelling my title, but that is a point I must get across to others interested in this tray.A load for my lunch consists of a plate, 2 small bowls, and 2 large glasses, and I have to be EXTREMELY careful to not spill anything as it buckles so easily. I could see its appeal for maybe one plate and a glass, but nothing more.Will be using it as a gun cleaning tray and home improvement projects to keep small parts together.This would be nice for kids playing w/ Playdo or holding paints.Get a fiberglass or bamboo tray for heavy loads.Pricey for what it is."
3,Not food-service quality,This item is acceptable for low abuse domestic environments but definitely not food-service quality. The type routinely encountered in fast food restaurants are much more durable and heavy duty. This product is an economical lightweight.
4,Keeper for sure,"I'm very pleased with product! It's exactly what I was looking for, durable and easy to handle."
2,Smaller than I expected/they use in the cafeteria,"You really get what you pay for. These trays are plastic and therefore not very rigid. When I carry it in one hand, cups tend to move around on it. They are noticeably smaller than the ones they use in the school cafeteria (which by the way is Southern Oregon University - where youre not allowed to use a tray to carry your food - only to put the used dishes on for return... Yeah I know right?!?)"
5,"nice sturdy tray,",just what i was looking for...for kids snacks etc. good choice of colors and sizes. speedy delivery. just right..
1,fuhgettaboutit,"I'm going to throw away my copy, too. Perhaps the most annoying aspect, for a film buff, is how the authors add insult to injury with their ""film reviews."" It's bad enough that they get facts wrong -- most of the score to ON THE TOWN was NOT written by Leonard Bernstein, for example -- but then these ignoramuses presume to pass negative judgment on classics like ON THE TOWN and FROM HERE TO ETERNITY, a right they clearly haven't earned with their ""research."""
1,Horrible,"I concur with pretty much all of the opinions here. I don't think it's any secret that the ""Rat Pack"" were not the most honorable of fellows but I think it is more of an insult that these two hacks thought they had the ability to write any sort of decent bio about them. What is worse, as one reviewer pointed out, was their feeble-minded review of their fimology (like anybody cares what they think?). Horrible book, waste of time."
2,"CLIFF ""RAT"" NOTES","Here is the deal. If you are just starting to get into the Rat Pack or any of the players individually. Then this book is a good start. I would call it the Cliff notes of the individuals and their movies. If you have seen all the movies including the Matt Helm movies or if you have already read books on Dean, Frank, Sammy's biography then you are way ahead of this book and pass it by.But if you have not seen the movies and want to learn the basics of each man and then from there search into each one of them seperatly then this is a good starter. There are some great books on all the guys but you will finded Sammy's Biography to be the most fun. Remember to check out deanmartinfancenter.com for more info on the Rat Pack. For the guys who wrote this you could have given us some fun facts or answered some questions, instead they read everyone else book and put together their own version."
2,pretty superficial,"I gave this book 2 stars,because I didn't think it was quite as bad as some of the other reviewers did.(Apparently,some people don't want to hear anything negative about ""MR.Sinatra"".Still,this was a pretty shallow book.It wasn't anywhere as good as Shawn Levy's book.In fact,I can't say that I learned anything about the Rat Pack that I didn't already know.If you're already pretty familiar with the Rat Pack,you can safely skip this one."
1,Yuck,This is not worthy of your time or money. There is nothing new here and it really amounts to a critical look at both the Rat Pack and their movies. All Quirk does is savage the films that these guys made as a group or by themselves. I hope the publisher is ashamed. The members deserve so much more than this...
3,Allegiance,"The main character in Allegiance is Daniel Lofton, a freshman in high school, who does not believe in the Pledge of Allegiance and feels it should be banned from his school. He decides to remain seated and silent during the Pledge of Allegiance. The book deals with his struggles of trying to persuade people to not believe in the Pledge, and also the responses he recieves from his teachers, classmates, and parents of other students.I found Daniel to be a very inspirational role model; being interested in the history of the country he lives in and wanting to share the history with others. Daniel reminds the reader the importance of understanding the meaning of words, instead of just reciting them.Overall, I found Allegiance to be an easy read, but also very tedious. The book is very repetitive; each day of school for Daniel is practically same. The book is not a challenge to read, but I tended to lose interest in it."
4,A book that surprisingly draws you in,"At first, I thought this book would be dry, and lack any meaningful plot. I was pleasantly surprised when I got past the third chapter or so, and I was drawn in. Being a political book, I figured if the characters had different views than I, it would be difficult to read. No matter what your political views, this is a great book to read in order to be educated about freedom of speech and how to compromise with others. At times, Shackelford focused too much on Daniel's love life rather than his struggle at school to get his message across. Despite this, he focuses enough on Daniel and his school life to keep you guessing what will happen next. I would recommend this book to government teachers lecturing their classes about the first ammendment. This is something that students will want to read and look forward to reading."
4,Business Circles,This book is great because it is a collection of stories from other graphic design business owners. The book allows you to get an idea of how others run their business on specific topics. It was a required text for a college course. After reading a section and getting an understanding of different methods we were required to choose which method we liked most. This helped us build a business model based on successful methods.
1,A couple of problems with Bryce Canyon,The first DVD had no sound and a fuzzy picture. A replacement was quickly sent to me and it had no sound and a fuzzy picture. I'd still be interested in having a copy if I could get a good one. There was no problem with a refund.
2,Rocky XXVIII,"So far past time to retire his vocals.. sad actually. Lyrically and musically Walsh's work is remarkably complex. I really like his work, but, I kept thinking what if someone who could sing would have stood in for him on this project... or what if he had done this 28 years ago. It he were to re-release Glossolalia as an instrumental without vocals I would be the first to buy it."
4,The missing link...,"Well, now I have both pieces of the puzzle, and I must say I think I was right: the Kansas ""Somewhere to Elsewhere"" and Glossolalia projects should have been consolidated, and the whole shebang produced by Trent Gardner. Anyway, this is as much a Trent Gardner album as it is a Walsh album. Those familiar with Gardner's work with Magellan and Explorer's Club will recognize the often left-field, stream-of-consciousness production, as well as the strange and arresting ""foley"" work. There's a lot of ""modern"" feel to this album in the use of ambient/techno and heavy metal sounds. I'm not a fan of either of these genres, but Gardner makes them work unusually well because of the sheer weirdness of his arrangements. ""Haunted Man"" and ""Nothing"" are well-written songs, and ""Heart Attack,"" if it were edited, could be actual single material! Just because Billy Greer and Mike Slamer play on this, don't for a minute think it sounds anything like the schlock rock of Streets."
5,"Apparently, great music still matters...","As a guitarist whose tastes tend more to fusion and metal than ""prog rock,"" I will freely admit to being surprisingly blown away by Glossolalia. Although I bought the CD because I can't get enough of Mike Slamer -- and the album doesn't disappoint on that score! -- I was won over by the overall quality of the musicianship, lyrics, production... in short, the total experience. There's not a weak song in the bunch. Glossolalia reminds me of a time when musicians were not afraid to push the envelope, to experiment, and to make music for creative, as opposed to purely commercial, reasons. Congratulations to Messrs. Walsh, Slamer, et al, for creating an extremely satisfying musical experience... and for giving a jaded cynic some hope that good music can still find an audience."
4,Walsh crunches and soars!,"Fan of Streets? Like Kansas at its most intense? THIS is for you! Steve sounds spectacular while his music punches hard and leaves a mark. Steve has firmly embraced aggressive musical arrangements and textures - he is not stuck in the 70's. Impressive musicianship, tight arrangements, soaring vocals, imaginative lyrics and real musical risks combine to produce an album of memorable ear candy. Play it LOUD!"
2,VERY SENSITIVE MEDIA PLAYER,"This is my second ARCHOS that I've had and I feel that it needs to be more durable for all the money you shove out to get it. My first one fell out my locker and I definitely accept responsibility for that, but this second one I've bought takes the cake. At first, it was doing fine. No issues. But now, it has shut down and it won't start back up. I went to the site and tried to reset it like the instructions said but that didn't work. So, I sent an email to the ARCHOS site and now I'm awaiting a response. I think I've finally learned my lesson. All that glitters is not gold!!! Beware Buyer, unless you are the type that don't mine spending money or super careful of all your stuff."
1,Don't buy the Archos 04 series if you live in a dry area with a lot of static electricity,This player is WAY too prone to static electricity. It crashed/rebooted EVERY TIME I touched it. I returned it for a refund.
4,Archos504,"Good sized product, easy to use and works straight out of the box. Great for storing pictures, videos, music etc... and as a media player works well. great alternative to the more expensive 'fruit' machines."
3,New toy purchased for my boyfriend,"I recently purchased the Archos 504 for my boyfriend for christmas. The cost of this item is misleading because many of the selling points are of no use without the addionaional significant costs of the extra items such as the head cam, extra battery and so on. If you have the money than go for it, if not you may want to shop around!"
1,NO RAW format support!,"The following review is only interesting for photographer:The main reason for me to buy the product was to backup and store photos from my Canon to a harddisk and have a fast viewer for the photos. I shoot the photos in .jpg and .raw format.I upgraded my Archos 504 from the former AV 420 which did support .jpg and .raw backup from my Canon, but the photo viewer was incredible slow.You don't find any Information about storing the .raw format on your Archos... I bought the product in the believe that an upgrade can't mean a step back in the development... which was an error... it really DONT support .raw ... I asked the helpdesk if they plan to support the .raw file in future... their answer was NO, they decided against raw format.Nevertheless the picture viewer and the video things work fine, just for those who want to store .raw files as in the past, forget it...Thanks Archos, so you make it easy for photographer to change the backup system to other companies like Creative."
4,great product,"This baby is a little big for the athlete but as mp3/pmp toys go its awesome. The screen is very high quality, the OS is very user friendly, down and up load times are relatively fast. The one negative thing I have to say about it is that it does not support all file types. The company has made it so you can do firmware updates for free which is great but these updates should include codec/plugins for all video file types. This particular product does not include mpeg 1 or 2 type videos. So you have to go to the Archos website and order a disc (you can't even download it from the site) with the plug-ins. That said everything else about this thing is really great."
1,Disappointing Kung Fu Flik,This movie revolves around the notoriuous White Lotus Cult as implied by the title. Unless you're a fan of traditional Chinese storylines give this one a miss as the martial arts choreography leaves something to be desired.
5,great for dolls,This is the best doll carseat I have come across yet. Works just like a real one could not have made my daughter any happier.
4,5 year old loves this,"My 5 year old loves this thing. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that I just think it's pricey, really. Even the American Girl Doll one is less expensive than this one. My kid is happy though, so I am happy."
5,Makes my five-year old feel like a real mom!,"What a great toy for my daughter, who is obsessed with her dolls and doll accessories!This car seat works with the Joovy doll stroller:Joovy Toy Doll Caboose Tandem Stroller - Pink DotThis is seriously almost just like a real baby carseat. It even comes with the LATCH system to install the base in your car. This just thrilled my daughter, because she really loves that it is so realistic.It fits larger dolls, as her favorite doll is 22"" and weighs 5lb 5oz.Highly recommend. Yes, it's pricey, but the other car seats and carriers fall apart with slight abuse, and this one is built to last."
1,Low print quality ruins the experience,"The content of this book seems excellent, but I cannot stand the poor print quality. LabVIEW is a visual programming language, and most of the diagrams are too blurry to read. I contacted the publisher, and got no follow-up response. If you purchase this book, look through it right away and be prepared to return it at your inconvenience. Prentice Hall should be ashamed. The book is published in New Jersey, but it looks like it was printed on an old dot matrix printer from the 1980s."
4,Good book for design concepts,It is agood book to know the design concepts.Although the print is not clear but the website provides most of the Block diagrams.Recommended reading for anyone developing and designing using LabVIEW.
5,an excellent alphabet and birthday story,"we gave miss spiders abc to our daughter for her first birthday. the paintings are so bright and active...unlike those in any other book, that she loves them. she's also started to learn her abc's, and the words happy birthday."
4,Beautiful Bug Book,"I purchased this book as an interesting way to view the ABC's. It has wonderful color illustrations of bugs I have never heard of before and many that I know and love. However, it is a bit difficult of a beginner to read. The adults in my office, who do speak English, even had a hard time figuring out some of the words. This is a lovely book because of the pictures but the story is a bit difficult."
5,Beautifully illustrated,"The 3 dimensional style of the photographs of bugs and insects fascinates my young boy. He is more interested in the story than the letters; however, I expect that will change as he grows older. The author and publisher have clearly put a great deal of effort into this book and the other Miss Spider books. The books are certainly worth the price and do make an excellent birthday gift. Highly recommended!"
4,Daughter Loves Miss Spider,"Our first Miss Spider book was Miss Spider's Tea Party, and my 1 1/2 year old daughter loved it. When she turned 2 I decided to purchase another book from the serie, and chose this one, so we could practice the alphabet. However, what turned out to be her favorite page is the very last one...""Shhhhh...Suprise, Happy Birthday Miss Spider."" She screams the phrase out (right before bedtime), and then we sing Happy Birthday to Miss Spider. Not only does she know her ABC's but now she also knows and signs Happy Birthday to everyone, and everything."
5,A Sorrowful Song,"For Elton John, his music has always spoken deep meanings in the AIDS community. The 1992 music video, The Last Song, is a powerful meaning to a community that has been heavily targeted for several years.The song was featured from Elton John's 1992 album, The One, and was just the very beginning toward The Elton John AIDS Foundation, that has currently raised over $20 million. It is Elton's only music video single, but it is truthfully worth it for the message."
2,Didn't fit,I made sure I purchased the correct installation kit for the year/make/model of vehicle that we installed the new stereo system. It did not fit. There are gaps around the entire thing and we had to secure it temporarily until we can get a new one that fits correctly.
1,Barely works,"Warning! The mp3 adapter plug broke within one week. Also, CD player has trouble with 20% of the discs I try to play. This player is cheap, and you get exactly what you pay for. Don't make my mistake."
4,very good,"I bought this kit for my Suzuki Esteem 2001 and look really good, but I give it 4 stars because I have to make some adjustment on a dash board because the frame was little bit bigger, so I do little work with the knife."
2,Get what you pay for,"This kit fit in my 2003 GMC Sierra, but it's all cheap plastic. I'm waiting for it to break any day now."
2,Wrong one...,"I got this install kit for my 95 Chevy S-10 Blazer, but once I opened it I immediately knew that it was the wrong one for my truck, just from the size of the area in my truck compared to the install kit. On the outside of the package and on the description says this will fit a 92' and up, but this is the wrong kit for my truck. Then when you look at the intruction booklet for my type of vehicle, it says this kit is for a 02 to 04.Wish there was a better way to make sure that this type of kit will fit before ordering, now I gotta worry if the seller will accept the product after I opened it. Hopefully the wire harness I ordered is the right one. I wished I woulda just got this from somewhere it was easier to exchange."
1,Would not recommend,"The plastic is very cheap and brittle, I picked it up by the tabs that are supposed to screw it to the dash with the radio inside, and one snapped. If they can't support the weight of the radio being lifted face up, I can't see them lasting that long with the force vector coming from an even worse angle.The instructions were worse than useless. I spent too much time trying to make them work, then finally just looked at what I had, and tried various combinations until I found something that worked."
3,Adapters...,"Me fue util, aunque tuve que hacerle adaptaciones, en general, el material es bueno.Me funcionó bien, no tengo quejas del producto."
1,wont fit 92 geo tracker withoud modification,"brittle plastic, didn't fit rite, lousy product, instruction book was less than useless it gave incorrect directions, I've installed hundreds of car stereos if i was not mechanically inclined the instructions would have made it impossible to use this, if you have a suzuki sidekick or a geo tracker don't get it fair price would have been about $5 but at over $10 its horrible value for money due to the quality of the plastic"
2,weak,"Yeah. Broke upon isntalling. However bein the handy guy i am, i rigged that baby and its fine. They should def beef up the mounting wings some how to prevent this. And send me a new one when they do!!!!!!"
1,Mislabeled / Cheap,"It wasn't made for my truck or I just didn't get all the parts... The instructions make sense if you studied some sort of rocket science. Either way, it was cheaply made plastic with burrs all over it and I'll just stick with Scoshe from now on."
1,didn't fit,When I ordered this it was discribed as fitting my truck. It didn't. Amazon refunded my money. The help desk of the product advised I needed another one of their products to work with my truck. I found it at a local store.
4,"nothing flashy, just functional","This worked just fine to house my new radio to replace the factory radio, giving me a tiny little shelf underneath as well. Reasonably priced, and no problems with it."
1,Wrong kit,This kit states that its for 92-up gm vehichles. I have a 99 gmc pickup and the kit was completely the wrong size. The main unit was too tall to fit in the stock location and there were no adapters on the sides for the pinch spring style clips for the sides of the stereo. I went to Oreilly auto parts and they had the right kit in stock for only 7$ more.. If you have the late 90's model gm full size pick ups I suggest going there and just saving yourself the headaches. I believe wal-mart has the same kits on hand as well.
4,"Looks good, low cost",This kit worked well in a 2003 Malibu. I gave it four stars only because the lower compartment (if you use it) could be a little more level. It has a bit of a dip in it. It really looks fine though and blends well with my dash. The instructions told me what to do for my vehicle. For some reason I don't think the instructions mentioned this product working for a 2000 or earlier Malibu. I had a '97 before and feel the dash is the same as the '03 but it could be different.
2,You get what you pay for,"Purchased this for use with a 2003 Pontiac Sunfire. It seems like snapping a few pieces of plastic together should be easy - but the directions are impossible to understand. It isn't clear what tabs are supposed to be cut, and the pieces do not go together as directed. We ended up using only the main piece, and some industrial-strength velcro to hold the stereo properly.Once the install kit was in, the front ring does not fit flush in the space allowed on the Sunfire. The only options are to have one side popped off, or to remove the ring entirely. I suppose a third option would be to use a grinder to whittle off some of the plastic on the edges, but I doubt the cheap plastic would withstand any sort of pressure before snapping.In all, I'd avoid this product and look elsewhere."
3,hammy,well it fits in my car but its feels cheap i guess its worth what i paid but i wish it wasnt so easy to break.
2,Not Really,"I like the fact that it comes with an instruction booklet, but, the fact that my 99 Lumina isn't covered under this 99-03 installation kit kinda makes me angry a little bit. Maybe include the models it does and doesn't fit on the product page somewhere eh?"
3,Does not fit my Geo Metro,"The mount itself seems nice and sturdy and I had no problems with it except that (as another review states) It does not fit my 1994 Geo Metro. I wish I would have seen that review before I ordered. Amazon's ""Make sure it fits"" matching system claimed it fits and it does not. It is about 3/4 of an inch too wide and the ports to screw it into the dash are in the wrong place. It's a shame, I really wanted to little pocked underneath and, like I said, it does appear to be a good product."
4,Great Product,Great product! Easy to install and fits the 2004 Chevy Monte Carlo perfectly! I even like the pocket underneath for my phone and remote control!
4,Does the job and looks good,Bought this to install a Pioneer unit in my 2001 venture. It fit good and came with a ton of parts to install just about any configuration of stereo you'd be likely to have. Seems sturdy enough and looks good and even has some punch holes in the CD cubby so you could run a wire to the back of your unit. Only downside I can see is that the instructions are not the most comprehensive. Still in all it's pretty easy to figure out and seems to work good.
4,Works with 07 Colorado,"Bought this item to install a new stereo in my 07 Chevy Colorado. It worked well, but be aware the instructions leave much to be desired. Also I had to trim a couple pieces of the outer bezel so it would sit flush."
4,metra radio install kit,"The directions are easy to understand and complete. I wish the radio had a little more support, but I'll see how it holds up."
3,rusting,I've had this for a few months now but it's starting to rust. but what can you expect with cheep silverware...
1,Wasted Money,"I feel stupid, I should have read the customer reviews BEFORE I bought this set. Hopefully others will read them and not buy."
2,QUALITY IS POOR,"I bought this silverware set for my daughter and was very embarrassed when I saw the quality. You definitely pay for what you get. This is a cheap, lightweight silverware set and I would not recommend it if you are looking for quality over value."
3,Pretty Good.,"Lower quality set than expected. Price was too good to be true.. This silvereware is almost cute, but willsnot stand the test of time."
4,Nice Set,"They are a nice set of silverware if you are not looking for anything fantasy. They are good for everyday use. However, the feel of them is less than elegant. For the purposes I have for them, it is just fine."
5,Excellent Islamic Devotional Songs,This is a wonderful CD. Shaam is a great Islamic performing group that doesn't add haram music to express their artistic talent or taint their religious devotion. I can't wait for their next one!
4,Good,This is a good CD. If you like Shylock and Shakra you would like this disc. Their other release is better though.
2,Robinson's Damned Good Show,"I read ""Piece of Cake"" first, was very happy with the book. I decided to take a chance on another of Robinson's works, chose ""Damned Good Show"" and was very disappointed. Character development was poor. The plot just seemed to be thrown together. Air battle didn't measure up to ""Piece of Cake."" The book just sort of seemed to come to an end when the author got tired of writing. The end of ""Piece of Cake"" was much more satisfactory. I was left with a sense that the war would indeed go on and on, and the two principle characters would carry on but we never know what happens to them.I don't recommend ""Damned Good Show."""
5,Damned Good Show,"A fitting companion to Derek Robinson's other war stories - Piece of Cake, War Story etc. A solid, interesting and often compassionate look at RAF Bomber Command during WW2. Robinson's fighting stories are not the ""guts or glory"" books, but tell it pretty much like it was. His research is excellent and his stories always enjoyable."
4,Not bad but not his best,"A pleasant enough read in itself but it fails to reach the heights of Goshawk Squadron and even more so A Piece of Cake. In many ways, Mr Robinson in rewriting the same story in a different theatre. Perhaps, I am being unfair but the Battle of Britain boys just seemed more vivid than Bomber Harris's men. The same themes of perception, propaganda and purposelessness weave their way through the story and a sense of continuity is provided by the presence of Skull as it is by the tragedy and waste of the other brave men who populate it."
3,"More Derek Robinson, but not great Derek Robinson","I decided to rate this book on the Derek Robinson bell curve, giving it 3 stars as a D.R. novel, equivalent to 4+ stars as a war novel. It's a slight change of pace, moving to bombers, but otherwise vintage Robinson. We meet the characters, they get killed off. He's not really plowing any new ground here, but it's still a fun ride. Great historical detail, and you always learn something new about WW2 pilots you never knew before."
4,Mobile Edge METL08 Ultra Tote Chocolate Suede,"This was much bigger than I expected!!! But, I am keeping it for travel. I can put everything I need in it including my lap top and P.J.'s..great travel bag. Delivery was faster than expected and packaging was great. It looks very nice..great color."
4,good for me,"Nice product, but I'm not very sure how to rate it after 4 meals. It didn't make the banana bread in 2 hours, not even in 3h... probably 4h on High will work. The chicken with vegetables was ready after 9h on LOW, but the beef no, after 6h on High. I have to try many other recipes before change my rate.Update 10/05/2007I love this slow cooker and it deserves all 5 stars. I figured out what went wrong in the beginning and I'll never put a slow cooker under an AC opening! :-)... the temperature inside the pot was decreased by the cool air from AC."
4,Good beginning,"We settled on this crockpot after reviewing several others. It's appeal was size, electronic settings and ease of cleanup. In our first endeavor, a chuck roast, onions, carrots and potatoes turned out just great. And lots of juice for gravy! We'll get better at it as we use it. One suggestion: It would be a nice feature if the timer/heat setting could be set to cook an hour or two on high and then switch itself to low for the duration of the cook time. Maybe the next model...just our luck."
5,Great Design,Excellent service so far. Great control over cooking time and it keeps the meal warm until time to be served. The handles made into the cool housing are really great. I've had problems with other brands being recalled because of the handles and then had the handles break off the replacements.I love mine and bought one for each of my daugther-in-laws as gifts.
3,Not bad...,"The slow cooker works good, the only thing I didn't realize when I bought it is that you don't have full control of the settings... For example, if you want to cook something on high for 4 hours, you have to set the slow cooker timer to 6 hours and use a different timer to remind you to turn it off manually. I think the directions say it automatically cooks on low for anything between 6-10 hours and stuff you put in there to cook from 1-5 hours automatically cooks on High.Other than that, I love it. This slow cooker came with a bonus carrying case, that has zippers and velcro and a handle, which is very nice. It also came with a meat rack, silicon bread pan thing, and a silicon cover, perfect for covering left overs and putting it in the fridge."
3,cooks to slow,"I love the looks of this crock pot. I wanted one for a while . My son give me one for my birthday . It just cook to slow , you set it on high its sets for 5 hours and you can not set the hours any higher . If you are not home it will kick to warm and not be doen yet. If you set it for 10 hours on low and its a roast it is still not done . I cook red Beans in my new crock pot on low for 10 hours . the beans wa snot done . I had to hurry and cook a quick meal and finish the beans the next day. We like sofe beans not hard ."
1,It arrived broken,I would have loved this crock pot if it hadn't arrived in broken pieces. I loved that it had a carrying case and an extra lid. I also loved that it had a glass cover because the plastic handle on the one I use at home melted off. (My favorite recipe cooks 8 hrs. on high)This was my first Amazon purchase. I was so disappointed! I prefer to purchase at a hands on store. Returning this was a hassle no matter how conveniant they made it- it still required me to do a job when all I wanted was a crock pot. I could've gotten another one but I didn't want to go through the irritation again. Too bad I can't find this particular product anywhere.
1,doesn't work,"i push the start button and it will automatically go to warm, then nothing happens.i cannot get the cook time to adjust in any way."
1,Stops working after a few uses,"I have had two of these. The first one stopped working after maybe 10 uses. I thought it was just a lemon, and I did like that it was insulated, so I bought another one. The second one lasted only slightly longer. When it fails, it barely gets warm, even when set on high. I'll never buy another one."
5,Excellent,I ordered 3 of these.I am very pleased to have this.It cooks very good and very tasty.I got these items in a timely manner.
2,"Overpriced, outdated, packed with technical jargon","I'm really disappointed by this text. It is exceedingly jargony and full of unnecessary acronyms. The publisher did not bother to include an acronym list, which seems like a big oversight in such a technical book.The charts and tables included are useful, and I think it could continue to be a useful reference for someone new to Environmental Impact Assessment work who is doing it on a regular basis. But it is so technically-written and full of jargon that it will appeal only to a very narrow audience. It is very clear that the author is an engineer. It is not clear how he expects people to use this text -- it is certainly not very readable."
3,Rich Kid Blues Incognito,This album is actually 'Rich Kid Blues' which was originally released in 1972. Her voice is very thin and weak because of drugs. The songs are good and I believe any real fan should have this in his/her collection. Any one who is not truly enamored of Ms. Faithfull may have a hard time appreciating this recording.
3,Reich of the Black Sun,"This book took me forever to get through, partially because I had to concentrate on reading books that needed to be returned to the library and partially due to Farrells dry writing style. A good portion of this book is Farrells claim that the Nazis had nukes. He shows a lot of interesting coincidences and circumstantial evidence but doesn't make a 100% convincing case either. There's also stuff on Nazi secret weapons programs, Nazi ""UFOs"", and even a little bit on the theories that are out there on secret Nazi bases under Antarctica and the North Pole. Overall this is interesting subject matter which is put together in a very dry way but if your into alternative viewpoints on history/WW2/Nazis then this may interest you."
2,Very speculative. Really a novel.,"A library would probably file this in fiction. The first part of the book, arguing the Nazis exploded an atomic bomb on the Eastern Front and others inside the Reich, is interesting. He even has a few facts that comply with this interpretation. But he can never convincingly explain why, if Germany had the bomb, it wasn't used against the Allies other than the Soviet Union.The last part of the book suggests UFOs come from Nazi remnant scientists. This weakens what began as an apparently serious book. Would have rated it a 4 if he'd omitted the UFO part."
2,not exactly fact,"Book has a lot of speculation, and edzageration. Overstatement of many things which are very remote possibilities, and which put the nazis in an all powerful light. This was not at all the case, and I prefer a more realistic view of the war, and it's technology.This is more like an indiana jones version of the nazi technology."
3,Who proofread this book??,"To being with, who proofread this book? There are typos on virtually every page. It is very distracting to read text like this. When I see this I wonder if the author really knows how to spell. There are some intriguing ideas in this book but most of the topics have been covered elsewhere, and by far better writers. Three stars for effort."
2,Utter Nonsense,"Besides the constant typos, the complete lack of proofreading there is the obvious fabrication of ""facts"", like the giant air field with 40 huge Heinkel bombers waiting to bomb New York. A friend in Norway who is also a WW2 affectionato tells me there never was an airfield like that, nor anything bigger than FW 200's stationed there. The ""scientific"" speculation toward the end of the book is laughable. Save your money and buy something with some credibility."
3,Interesting,"Is a iteresting book about some suspicius facts that ocour during the WWII and the years after, showing a lot of proofs that the germans already have the atomic bomb and other weapons, before the end og war. The autor also give some interesting arguments about technologies that were developed by the Nazi germans, that until now whe don't know how they achieve them."
3,AG Peppermint Wash Shampoo,"AG Hair - Peppermint Wash Active Lifestyle Shampoo 33.8ozI am disappointed that there is no scalp ""tingle"" similar to that of the AG Stimulating Balm Conditioner. I have super short hair so I wash it every day. My scalp has been dry and itchy with everyday use of this product. Now I only use it every few days. Others may not experience the same result."
1,"Stick with the Action Cape Batman 14"" figure","If I can help 1 person save their $$ by not buying this, I'll be happy. If you're looking for something that remotely looks decent, this isn't it. Stick with the Action Cape Batman from Mattel and/or the 30"" Batman Begins, available exclusively at Wal-Mart. The headsculpt of this $200 statue looks nothing like the box. I know I could do a better job on this. You will be disappointed. Save your money for other Batman Begins Collectibles."
1,Disappointed by Lapis Exillis: The Stone Is The Grail - An Exploration Into the World's Most Secret Societies,"This is basically the first documentary (contained on the first disk), which was amazing, packaged with 2 disks of worthless interviews, especially on the 2nd disk!If you already own the original documentary don't waste your money on this one!"
3,Disc 1 Awesome Discs 2 and 3 poor,"The first disc is excellent. The second and third just offer the narrator's autobiography and personal views on masonry and religion - mostly irrelevant, hardly interesting, and irksome in its clear advocation of mysticism and masonry. The time could have been better spent exploring the Book of Tephi, an Irish historical document where a queen of Ireland claims to be Jewish and to have brought the lapis exillis from Israel to Ireland around 550 B.C. The book is available free online at onread dot com but there's very few commentaries on it. Would love to see the producers of this DVD do another one on the Book of Tephi."
5,Bogen / Manfrotto,This is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone serious about their video.
5,Flawless plug and play operation.,"No need to go on and on here because this is a simple product that simply gets the job done. power down your G5, install the card, power back up the tower. That's it. 100% flawless plug and play. Too bad the $3,000 G5 didn't come with more than 2 SATA ports so I had to buy this in the first place."
4,Fun with stickers,This is a lot of fun for kids 4-6. They put tiny stickers on the right number. It comes with 5 scenes and takes awhile so it is worth it even though you can't do it over and over again like the button art.
4,Great gift,"Got it for a friends' daughter and she absolutely loved it. She's 6 years old and couldn't stop playing with it. The only downside I suppose is that the colors are a little off, meaning by that, that for example the princess skin is pink rather than more of a natural color (and I mention this because my friends' daughter kept asking about why she'd such a weird skin color)."
4,Fun and easy,"I bought this item for my 6 year old niece (soon to be 7) for Christmas. She loves doing crafts and making things. This is a big hit with her. She will always ask to do crafts, but she doesn't always have the patience and is done after a few minutes. This item she will get out by herself and sit for an hour or more and play. She will sometimes ask me to do one with her ~ and I have to admit that I was having fun making the pictures too! (And I won't give you my age....) They have a little chart that tells you which color tile goes with which number ~ so she was able to open the box and know exactly what to do the very first time she played. Sometimes the tiles DO get stuck together and you won't get them apart and you can lose some of the tiles, so you do need to watch out for that.... But all in all, my niece loves it and I love the fact that there is no messy paint, glitter or glue involved."
3,Looks great but has issues,"I have owned 3 pairs of these shoes. The first one lasted several years in daily use with no problems. The second pair I had less than 2 years with only occasional use. To my surprise, the sole on one of the shoes cracked all the way across. The other one had a crack maybe 2 in. long but not all the way across. I contacted Eastland and they sent me a prepaid shipping label and I returned them. They apparently agreed that the soles were defective and replaced the pair of shoes. The leather uppers were in good shape and there was little wear on the soles but the cracks in them made them worthless. I know the shoes are made in China now and that may have something to do with it but I really don't know. I will see how the new pair performs. If they crack as well I guess I will look elsewhere for shoes in the future."
2,Complete junk,This shoe was absolute CRAP... Plastic sole that had ZERO tread. Junky laces. Bad leather. Horribly constructed. Claimed size was WAY off... Will never buy this brand again...
4,Pretty good,I really enjoyed this book but it does get a bit heavy into the local politics at times. It was written in 1977 but the age doesn't affect it too much.
4,Have I Got a Story for You! It's the Real Emes!,"In a marvelous mixture of oral history and subtle theory, the Cowans explain -- illustrated by the stories of first-generation American Jews who emigrated from Eastern Europe, or whose parents emigrated from the east -- how and why many of them ""made it"" in America. The Cowans (Ruth is a distinguished history professor at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, and the author of More Work for Mother and A Social History of American Technology; Neil is a public relations consultant) argue that Eastern European Jews in American shtetle answered the question ""What is a Jew?"" their own way, avoiding the twin pitfalls of total assimilation or clinging to the old ways.After you've read Our Parents' Lives, go out and rent Barry Levinson's screen gem, Avalon, to see the embodiment of the Cowans' theories, and maybe shed a tear of two."
4,Fantastic band,"The only unfortunate thing about this album is the fact that you either have to go to a specialty record store to find it or you have to be overcharged through the internet. The songs are very catchy and the band has a distinctly English sound... all-in-all, a very good buy."
3,Subtile shift from pink floyd-house to cure-big beat,"being a wanna-be musician myself, this band sets the controls for the heart of my imaganative own band. Mixing real drums and machinery, and adding especially the combination of hectic rhythms and laid back melancholic singing, this is what pink floyd, the cure and kraftwerk can be proud of."
4,Homebrewer was happy,"I don't make beer, but my husband does and the book was a gift for him. When I got the book and looked through it, I wasn't sure if it would be what he wanted, but he seems genuinely pleased with it. He says that it's been a useful reference tool and that the author is very knowledgeable."
1,Broken within the first 1-2 months,"This watch didn't survive being worn in the shower the first month. No moisture was seen inside the dial, but at almost one month after receiving it, the watch simply stopped working. Fortunately Amazon took it back.On a side note, I just noticed this weekend that my 9177 (women's version) has a broken pin where the safety clasp is, meaning that if it ever falls out, the safety clasp will be useless."
3,Worth the price but some details not too fine.,"Just got my long awaited Invicta Men's 8926OB! The watch looks nice and the weight are surprisingly heavy (normally a low price watch would be light). Good to wear and it works fine. However, the paint finishing on the bezel is a bit not fine, the word ""50"" there's a bit of paint overlap on it, make it not perfect. I turn the date to ""1"" as today are 01.01.2013, I found a small dirt on the no.""1"" date. It's very small thing but it make my watch inperfect. The crown are a bit light compare to SEIKO SKX007, but still easy to screw. Conclusion, an automatic watch with Rolex Submariner alike outlook with this kind of price, you just can't complaint much and it worth the price. But just pray it won't spoiled within 1 year or 2."
5,Great watch for a reasonable price,"I was surprised when going over my previous Amazon orders, I ordered this Invicta Pro Diver watch in February 2009, almost 4 years ago. I have used it almost daily since I bought it and it has worked perfectly. The watch still looks good, though, as other reviewers noted, the shiny middle links in the bracelet and the clasp do show minor scratches (that aren't really noticeable from a few feet away.)For a traditional movement watch, it keeps perfect time, rarely gaining or losing more than 15 seconds a month. I haven't been able to tell if it runs fast or slow, as it usually is only a few seconds from the Atomic Time reading from my computer. The handy rotating bezel is still tight and setting the date on months of fewer than 31 days works perfectly.Over the holidays I looked at other Invicta diver watches and may buy one in another color as an alternative to this one. I am very pleased with the watch and would not hesitate to recommend it to a friend."
5,10 years and counting,"I purchased the 8926 with the black and red bezel back in early 2002. First off, over the last 10 years I've abused this watch! I work construction so for the last 10 years this watch has been there every day and also in the rain and snow. I don't abuse my watches but I expect them to perform and hold up when conditions get a little rough. The watch still keeps great time and I definitely feel like I've got my moneys worth. So, my experience with Invicta and this watch have been great. Expecting my new Invicta 3044 in two days!!!!"
2,"Beautiful, but useless","Look, the situation is plain and simple. The watch is well put together and beautiful.But for whatever reason it's not a good time keeper.Mine gains 6 minutes per week and that makes it useless as a watch.Even for an automatic, this is very poor performance. It's going back."
1,Beautiful watch/Won't keep running!,"Beautiful to look at, but won't stay running- weak main spring? Purchased August 2009. Always lost 3 to 4 minutes a week. Invicta needs to do some serious quality control."
2,Invicta Pro Diver Coin Edge Automatic Watch,"This is the second Invicta Pro Diver watch. The first I dropped on the tile floor in my bathroom and smashed the crystal. It was more cost efficient to buy a new watch. Although the first watch was almost perfect, this new watch is very difficult to set and/or wind. If I try to wind, the date changes. After changing the date, the crown is very hard to wind into the lock. If I wear the watch all the time, which I don't, everything would be fine. It's a great looking watch, but I'm not happy with thw winding and date change feature."
1,"INVICTA - looks will deceive, this is a cheap watch","I have owned many watches in my life and never had trouble with any of them EXCEPT the Invicta 8926OB. This was my first Invicta watch and it will be my last. It arrived defective. I was able to set the time but not the date and the crown would not go back to its original position. By not doing so, it will allow moisture into the watch which voids the warranty. Worse, Invicta charges the customer to send back its merchandise under warranty - even if its defective from the factory AND it takes 90 days to return it to you. Don't let its handsome looks deceive you - this is a cheap watch and not worth the trouble.UPDATE: I FINALLY received the watch back from the factory from repair (so far I have not been able to wear the watch) and it is STILL BROKEN. Unbelievable. POOR QUALITY, POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE, POOR WORKMANSHIP"
1,"Looks great, but very poor quality.","This is a beautiful watch that looks almost identical to the Rolex Submariner. I took a chance buying this based on some poor reviews because I wanted the looks of the Rolex without spending a fortune, but I also wanted a watch that was functional. Unfortunately the watch broke almost immediately. The instructions indicate to unscrew the crown and then very gently pull it out to the first click to set the time, and the second click to set the date. I pulled the crown out as gently as possible since I'd read numerous other reviews that indicated problems with the crown. One gentle pull and the crown came completely out of the watch. After reinserting it would not adjust the time or date. I returned the watch for a refund.If you're lucky enough to get one that actually functions, I'm sure you'll be satisfied with the looks. But based on all the reviews and my experience, there's a reason the watch is so cheap."
1,"Not Water Proof, Not a Diver Watch","First diving trip I took this watch on to 110ft down, it flooded, I have had $8 digital watches purchased at k-mart that survived longer.I wasn't expecting it to be a Rolex or a Omega, but first dive?"
2,Save your money & buy a Swiss movement watch,"Pros:1. Good build quality2. Name brand companyCons:1. Absolutely no reserve time (<=24 Hours)2. No hack mechanismThe main problem with this watch is it does not hold the resever power, its less than 24 hours. What it means is you have to keep wearing it everyday else it stops within no time. The second problem is lack of hack mechanism.I got couple of replica watches around the same time I got this watch from Amazon & surprisingly the replica watches fare better both in terms of the reserve power & providing the hack mechanism.The replicas said they were japanese movement, I am not sure but still they are doing decent with the time. I am not a Chinese replica watchmaker or their representative advocating replica watches but I think if you are not buying a Swiss automatic movement watch then its best to just buy a replica watch. Afterall people buying Invictas are just looking for cheap lookalikes for popular watches like Rolex or other brands."
2,"looks great, but does not keep time well","This watch looks great, but cannot keep time at all. The watch gains 2 minutes a day.Since you must wind the watch daily, setting the time a couple of minutes each day is not such a big deal, unless you're like me. I can't stand when something doesn't work like it's supposed to, and a watch that can't keep time just bugs the perverbial cr@p out of me."
5,"With the price I get, it gets Five stars!","I got it for $65 last month and I love it so much that I wear it all the time. Bezel was impossible to turn when I received it, so I thought it was defect. But, when I put it in the water (hey it is a diver watch!) for a while, I was able to turn it smoothly. There must be some glue left over and water probably dissolved some? I don't know but it worked. Try it out! Also, mine gets faster every week by a few min. It doesn't bother me because I normally put my watch a five min. faster anyways.I bought two of these watch but ended up returning one because the other one has defective bezel (improperly installed) and the crown wasn't going all the way in. (I had to push it really hard) May be this was the problem leaking water that other buyers complained about?With the price I got, it get's five stars. It is a beautiful watch if you get non-defective one. Oh. Make sure you get the coin-edge bezel one because it looks so much better."
3,Very fast shipping,"Shipping was very fast and watch is decent quality for the money.This watch apes the looks of a Rolex Submariner quite well.Machining on the case is good with no sharp edges, dial rotates smoothly and lines up with markers and movement seems good (Citizen Miyota) but waiting for it to settle in. Bracelet is very sub-par despite having solid links. End links however are folded and clasp is not quite as refined as others (Seiko) and does have some sharp edges as well as lending a very hollow and rattely sound to the bracelet overall.All-in-all, not bad for the money."
4,Invicta automatic,"I am satisfied,this is an ok watch, very good looking [copy of the most famous submariner..but with smaller enlarging lens for date window]. Charge reserve rather short.after replacing steel bracelet with leather brown band with white double stiches, it looks even better."
4,Good watch for the price,"If you want an automatic watch that looks like a Rolex without the price tag of a Rolex, this is the watch for you. Had it for a few months now and it's been working flawlessly for me. Drifts about a minute every week. Not too bad for the price."
5,Great watch! Best value for money.,"I really love this watch. A truly classic design in the style of the Rolex Submariner, but this watch is much more than a cheap lookalike!It is a very accurate watch - at least my one with 2 sec. slow in 24 hours! - , has a nice watchband and some beautiful gadget:On the back of the second hand is the Invicta emblem - a swiss cross with wings on it.Overall a well assembled product with a great value for money."
4,great look,"i bought this watch for myself b/c I had not purchased a new one in a while... so here we are.the looks of it are nice the 200 meter water resistance has come in handy, the only things i do not like about it is the crown keeps digging into my wrist and the 'sweeping seconds hand' does not have that smooth flow to it like my other automatics do. but all in all for the price it cant be beat."
5,Great look and feel,"I bought this for my 17 year old son. He loves it. It looks and feels like a much more expensive watch. While the second hand sweep is not as smooth as a high dollar Rolex, it's very nice. I could live with out the cyclops over the date, but he doesn't mind it. The only issue he has with it, is that the bezel is very tight to rotate. Over all, it's very nice, very acurate and feels like it should last a long time."
2,Losing time:(,"I have 2 of these particular(8926ob) and a 0480 automatic and a 4342 with battery. All of these watches lose time, 1 of the 8926's totally stopped working exactly 1 year and a month after purchase date, warranty had ran out of course. Bought these watches cause they looked close to a rolex without the price, even heard somewhere they got sued by rolex for the type movement they put in them. Thought I was gettn something good. These watches look great but bad quality movement. So when warranty runs out on all, I'll be out 350.oo for all. ;("
2,Beware!,"The seller of this product is wonderful--GREAT customer service and fast shipment. However, in my opinion, the watch is beautiful except that the bezel is next to impossible to turn. I had accidentally ordered this twice so when the second watch came in I would keep the good one and advise the seller of the bad one. Unfortunately, upon receipt, the second watch's bezel was difficult to move--it turned about 1/4th of the way and I could not turn it the rest of the way.So, if you are looking for a rotating bezel, this watch I do not recommend--unless you are just buying only on the aesthetics of the watch. Again, the seller is great and have no problems with the seller-will definitely buy from the seller again!!"
1,great watch - if it worked,"I ordered this attractive watch to use while actually diving. I bought it in September, but didn't get around to taking it out of the box until after Amazon's return period had expired. The minute hand does not clear the hour hand on it's circuit, so the watch is useless. It will cost me almost as much in shipping and repair fee, under the manufacturer's warranty, to get it working as I paid for the thing. So I'm out $90, and still don't have a working watch. Great deal.Invicta Men's 8926OB Pro Diver Collection Coin-Edge Automatic Watch"
1,Not worth the money,"I bought this watch for daily use. The watch stops walking, gets behind 5-15 minutes. You have to shake your hand to keep the watch running. Not worth the money!!!"
1,It is slow 15seconds per day,"I bought this 2926c watch as a chirstmas gift for myself, but after I received it and compare time with my cellphone and found 2days later it slow down 1min. I checked it every day and found at least 15sec slow per day. I just want to change another one, but amazon sold out, I had to refund it."
2,very so-so,"Looking at some of the reviews here has me laughing a little. This watch, in my opinion, does not have a quality feel to it. The bracelet is rather lightweight and cheap and rattles. Same for the clasp, very thin and light. The crown feels coarse as you turn it. The dial and hands do look fairly nice. The watch itself, sans bracelet, is heavy, which some people correlate with quality, apparently. Back to some of the comments in other reviews, you know, ""I have 32 expensive watches and this is far better than any of them"" or ""it's darn near as good as a rolex"" (no, it isn't), are just hard to fathom. I'm no watch snob (my daily beater is an LL Bean watch) but I own an older Rolex so have some experience as to how a quality watch looks and feels and find it hard to believe that anyone would ever mistake this for anything other than the cheap watch it is."
4,Nice watch for price,"Bought this watch not expecting too much, but liked the look of it compared to unobtainable Rolex. So far keeps great time, looks good, I've gotten a few complements in the couple weeks I've owned it. I will do fine until I can afford a higher end watch."
1,warranty work took way too long,"Second (and last) invicta I have purchased. I bought a lupah about 6 years ago - the stem broke in only a few months. Sent it back with the approx $25-30 fee to get it fixed. Had to wait for 3 months to have it returned. As for the pro diver - looked great, kept time almost perfectly for a few weeks (only gained a second a day), but about 3 months in the watched stopped altogether. Sent it in (with the fee again), and it took over 4 months to receive it back. I feel keeping a watch for 1/3 a year for warranty work is unacceptable. I wish the work would have been done for free - considering it was well under a year old - but when a service is paid for I expect a quick return or a replacement to be offered. I know automatic watches can take extra time to make sure they are regulated correctly, but the amount of time on this one seems unreasonable."
2,Four (4) defective watches in a roll,The last four Invicta 8926OB have been defective1st - there was a piece of glue hanging from where the crystal attached to the case2nd - the bezel was loose. It was wiggling and got looser by the day.3rd - the bezel was so loose that it rotated clockwise to almost 10 seconds. What I mean is that the bezel should only rotate counter clockwise. It should not rotate clockwise at all.4th - this one was even more loose and rotated even more counter clockwise than the third. On top of that the dial was not on center. That is the face of the watch was off-center.
2,"Great looks, Poor Quality","I bought this watch from Amazon over a year ago because I like the style and it being an automatic for $65. It worked for a few months then encountered a problem where it would stop at the 35 minute mark, even on a winder. It was passed the return period so I email Invicta warranty. The cost to ship back and forth to them would be almost half of what I paid for this piece of junk. It's not worth the hassle, it's now relegated to spare parts. I'm going to try the Orient Mako, I hope they take more pride in making watches then Invicta China made junk."
1,Which watch is this?,"SELLERS!! Please update your information.There are three different movements for this (8926OB) watch: The 21 jewel Miyota 8215 Winding Non-Hacking movement. The 23 jewel Seiko/TMI NH25A Non-Winding Hacking movement, and The 23 jewel Seiko/TMI NH35A Winding AND Hacking movement. I may be off with the the jewels since they're irrelevant. It's the winding and hacking that I'm looking for.Sellers should identify which one they're selling, or I'll keep returning them."
2,Not a Divers Watch,"I got this watch really fast with Amazon one day shipping, and the first impressions of this watch were that it was really nice, and had a nice finish to it. The day after I bought the watch, I went for a swim, and when I came out I realized there was moisture built up inside. Returned it the next day"
1,Fail,"The dial face of this watch is a cheap glossy plastic chip with a gastly motteled appearance when it catches light. The index marks are molded in. The stem and crown are junk. Don't believe the hype, get something else."
4,Not to shabby FOR THE PRICE!,"Well Invicta definitely has the looks down perfectly. This watch looks exactly like the Rolex submariner. That is where the similarities end however. for the price I can't really complain, however if I would have spent over $100 on this I would have been honestly let down. It feels fairly chintzy in hand, the bracelet is something like you would see from a Chinese knockoff, and the bezel is not as tight as I expected it to be. But the watch has a good quality Japanese movement from Seiko. It works well and as I said in the beginning it looks exactly like a Rolex submariner."
2,Broke after 2 months,An interior piece of the watch broke after two months. Not well made at all. Low quality watch. I'm returning.
3,"""INVICTA"" on case opposite of stem","This is a very nice watch. Unfortunately, the one thing I don't like about it could not be discovered before I ordered it. INVICTA is deeply engraved into the case on the side of the watch opposite the stem. This is not shown in any of the product photos or in the product description. I'm the type of guy who likes to keep labels to myself. Overall, I think this is a really nice watch. I just would have liked to know INVICTA was on the side of the case before I ordered it. Opening the box, and then having a sense of disappointment for something I was looking forward to receiving stinks."
2,Invicta Men's Pro Diver Watch #8926C Runs Fast,"I purchased this watch before x-mas based on the many positive reviews and was impressed when I received it by how the watch is made and the packaging. The watch looks nice, is just the right size for me but there is one problem- it runs about 5+ min. fast a month. I looked at the warranty and I can send it back within 1 year to be repaired but they want $25.00 for shipping. Almost 1/2 of what I paid for the watch. I would not buy another Invicta watch based on my experience with this one."
3,Invicta coin edge diver,"This watch is certainly worth the money..However,it is a bit small and light for my taste..The band is kind of light duty..Not the feeling of quality like another of my Invicta divers..It is what it is,and I cannot really fault this timepiece much...movement seems very smooth and is accurate..As usual,my experience with Amazon was good..."
1,Crap Watch. bad aftersales from Amazon.com and Invicta,2 months after sparingly using the watch The glow in the dark number '1' fell off and opstructed the second hand from moving.Amazon.com won't take it back.Invicta wants me to pay them to repair it and won't replace it.Don't buy this watch.
1,Broke after less than 2 months,"Watch is fogging up and won't keep correct time after less than 2 months. I'm out of the 30 day return period for Amazon, and the manufacturer won't do anything to remedy the situation, now I'm stuck with a broke watch that I paid good money for. Do yourself a favor and don't buy anything from Invicta."
2,Poorly made product--Caveat Emptor!,"After reading numerous reviews for the 8926C Pro Diver--both pro and con--I decided to order it. Since it's an automatic, I rotated it on my wrist numerous times to get it going (I own 4 other automatics, 2 of which are Invictas with no problems...) and it stopped after 2 minutes. Repeated attempts to get it going failed, no matter how much winding it received. Then, when I pulled out the stem to set the time did it finally start running!--for preceisely 2 minutes, then it stopped. I tried diligently for three full days to ""give it another chance"", etc. to no avail. I ultimately returned the watch and received a prompt refund credit from Amazon with no hassle. Overall, the 8926C Pro Diver is a great looking watch that didn't work for me."
2,Looks Aren't Everything,"I'll be the first to admit that this is a quite good looking watch but I will guaranty you that no one who actually picks up this watch will mistake it for a Rolex. It is a very light and flimsy feeling, and both the case and the band have hard edges that make the watch very uncomfortable. The movement seemed accurate enough, but the 2nd hand sweep seemed jittery to me. My uncle's Chinese Rolex knockoff had a smoother sweep(for a knockoff, it was surprisingly well made). I spend a lot more time with the watch on my wrist than I do looking at it, so it has to feel smooth and solid. It is going back to Amazon tomorrow."
4,A fine watch,"The only real problem is that the watch doesn't contain instructions on how to set it. On the advice from a friend, I learned to unscrew the crown (stem) by reading the Amazon notes."
3,8926C Pro Diver,The watch looks good however the band is very light weight and feels cheap. The band broke the first time I wore the watch and the jeweler has to order a part in order to repair it; I hope the repair is not more than the original purchase.If you are an Invicta collector this is a must have for your collection.
2,Band Broke after a couple of months.,"The watch works OK, but the band broke after a couple of months and a replacements costs nearly as much as the watch. Also, don't be fooled by the 'warranty'. You never receive notice of the extended warranty and THEIR shipping fees cost too much for it to be worth it.Overall, the company experience is a bit shady."
4,"Nice looking watch, wish the movement was more accurate","This is a great watch to add to any collection...the visible Miyota automatic movement is fun to look at, and alot of folks think i'm wearing a Rolex...this is a BEAUTIFUL watch.Nonetheless, as neat as it is to have a mechanical watch, the Miyota 8215 movement requires periodic resetting. I find that it runs fast, fast enough that I have to reset the time about every other weekend. For that reason, its just a piece for my collection, not a daily wearer.So get the Invicta if you love watches that look great, and tell good enough time. But, get yourself a Timex or another good quartz watch if you need ACCURATE time."
1,looks great but didn't work,Loved the look of the watch but it would only run for a couple of hours dispite winding it up and wearing it. So much for self winding. Sent it back and amazon credited me. I wish it was a regular battery operated watch so it would have kept time reliably.
3,Stops frequently,"Even after wearing for a few days to wind it up, it will stop if I set it down for a few hours. Stops every night unless I wear it to bed. Not sure whether to return it for a replacement or look for something else.Addendum: After wearing it for another day, it stopped stopping and has been keeping pretty accurate time."
4,Very nice looking watch,The only problem that I have is it runs a little fast. Three minutes by the end of a week. The watch is very nice looking and feels pretty solid. The band is nice but could be a little heavier. Overall for the price it's a very nice watch.
1,Invicta Mens Pro Diver Review,"While this watcth has the looks it lacks qaulity . This is the second pro diver I purchased for my son and once again the pins that attach the band to the lug have bent and caused the band to come off. If they sold 1.5 Million of this model watch as they claim,I would think they have been aware of this problem for some time now. Yet they continue to sell garbage that they know will break.When you try to get it fixed by Invicta,good luck.You will find out a replacement band will cost you 30% of MSRP. Do the math and you will discover they want to charge you more for the band then you paid for the watch!!!! Do not buy Invicta!!"
5,Beautiful Watch!,I have had this watch for a week and have been impressed with the quality and construction. I think you would have a very difficult time finding a watch with the same features and quality at this price. It has the elegant look of a Rolex at a fraction of the price.
5,Very Very nice watch!,I was searching for a self winding watch with the date! It was a Christmas gift and he loved it!
5,Great Watch,"This is my 3rd Invicta automatic with the Seiko NH35A hacking movement. It is very accurate. Mine gains just one second a day when compared to my Citizen Eco-Drive atomic watch. It looks awesome, too. Love it!"
1,no good,"I bought this watch as a gift for my father in law before he went on vacation overseas for 2 months. Well I got the watch back from my father inlaw, I tested it a few times and sure enough it stops even if you are wearing it. I'm now contemplating on spending money to send it back for repair or use it as a paper weigth"
2,"Watch nice, but wrist band cheap, very cheap.","I just got this watch since it looks really nice on the web and I felt confident about the watch from all the reviews. I finally decided to get it and it arrived today. Since I haven't the chance to see how accurate it keeps time, I'll just review the visual and feel quality. The watch as a whole is quite heavy, more than my Swiss Army. However, the weight is entirely from the case and none from the band. The band feels light and cheap, and it feels rough around the edges. When I put it on, it feel like it catches on my skin. I'm very disappointed on the quality completeness of the watch. If you like the design and can't afford to get the Rolex version, then get this. But you've been warned around the quality."
4,Well worth the price.,I am not much of a watch expert but I like the looks of this watch and for $90.00 I am very satisfied. It does seem to gain 20 to 30 seconds a day but otherwise works well.
4,Nice watch; small flaw,"This is my first automatic watch. A cheapo quartz movement might be more accurate, but an automatic movement--especially one you can see chattering away thru the exhibition case-back--has serious nerd appeal. One small problem: although the band is constructed of heavy, solid high-quality steel, the part of the clasp that touches the inside of the wearer's wrist is not. If your skin is sensitive to nickel like mine is, you'll want to coat that part of the clasp with some clear nail polish, or you'll get a pink welt on your wrist like I've got this morning.UPDATE: about a year later, I still really like this watch. After a few coats of nail polish on the inside of the clasp, I haven't had any trouble with my nickle allergy. I wear it daily and have banged it around a bit, so there are plenty of teeny scratches in the band and one very small (~3mm?) fine scratch in the crystal, but it still keeps very good time."
1,Very Disappointed,"Nice looking watch, but that's it. Never kept time. Bought a programable watch winder, still lost about 30 sec per day. The crown was difficult to lock and unlock. Had to send it back."
3,Lotta watch,"Runs fast, about 45 seconds per day, but not consistently. Don't know if this is typical for self-winders. For service, Invicta shipping charges kicks up the amount invested in the watch a lot. Will stick it out until later in the one year warranty period to see how it's working. Why couldn't this be adjusted locally? Local watch service would seem simpler."
1,Nice looking but very poor quality,"I received the first watch and had the same problem as others with the watch stopping at the 20 second mark even after winding it up. When it did run, it was running several minutes fast. I returned the watch and Amazon was very quick to send me a replacement except the replacement watches' crown would not screw down right out of the box!!! The replacement did not have a protective covering on the face and was obviously not new. Amazon was very helpful in accepting the second watch back and refunding my money. This is a great looking but bad quality watch."
1,Spotty Quality,"I've bought this particular watch a few times as gifts for others. They are generally a solid choice for a bang around everyday watch. The last 2 I purchased ('09 X-mas) both ended up with the same problem. The screw down crown threads stripped and now those watches can no longer be screwed down tight. Invicta may have changed vendors in China because the others are still running, with some approaching 10 years in age."
5,worth for price,Definitely you won't go wrong with this watch. You no need to spend $4k on rolex. It has similar look as rolex submariner. The only negative point is that after adjusting the time setting crown back to the normal position is not easy.
4,Nice watch; great value,"Good tribute watch and a great value. Keeps good time, and is well built. I have sanded down all the polished links on the band; gives it a less flash look. Zero complaints."
5,Fantastica compra,"El reloj supera con creces las espectativas. El acabado es de primera , estoy muy contento con la compra .Mi mujer era esceptica con la compra , cuando lo a visto lea encantado y me a pedido que le enseñe la pagina para mirar los que tienen para mujer .The watch far surpasses expectations. The finished is top, I am very happy with the purchase. My wife was skeptical with the purchase, but when see the clock she liked it so much and asked me to teach the page . She wants to look who have for women ."
5,Invicta purchase,"Awesome experience, no glitches, received exactly what I ordered and had it in my hand before expected. Price could not be beat, just an overall great experience, will definitely be back"
4,Great watch for the price,"I really like this watch, well made also came with cleaning cloth. The luminescence on this watch glow all night long! After ordering this watch I ordered a blue and gold one from another vendor on amazon. The blue faced watch was suppose to be newer and better. It even had higher ratings, cost more but is a piece of junk. Go with this model it is much better!"
2,Looks good...but...,"This watch is made to look like a Rolex and, actually, it does a very good job of that. The down side(s) are, the outside bezel tends to move on its own, the glass face is now starting to slightly discolor (approximately 7 months) and I'm careful not to take it under water. And lastly, it runs about 3 minutes fast per week. Considering the price for looks, still an ok buy."
2,"Looks nice, long term issues","I ordered this watch from Amazon roughly 6 months ago and was intially extremely pleased. It looks tremendous for the price- any of your friends who aren't well-versed in watches will be impressed. It keeps relatively good time- once again, a bit more than you would expect for <$100. Unfortunately though, about a month ago the watch lost the ability to engage the date function. It's absolutely impossible to change the date. Pretty darn annoying. However, the watch still looks nice and I occassionaly get compliments when I'm daft enough to wear it. So overall, it looks fairly nice and keeps relatively good time, but if you're looking for performance/durability, avoid invicta. If you're looking for an attractive diver on a budget, the orient mako is absolutely worth checking out."
5,Great watch for the money,"After reading many reviews I was a little nervous about ordering this watch, but gave it a chance anyway. I could not be more pleased with the form, fit and finish and would recommend to anyone. Great watch for the price."
4,Nice watch,"Purchased this watch as a gift. I wish it was a bit larger in diameter, but it would be perfect for a small wrist. Qualitywise, it looks expensive. I wear an Invicta watch myself, and I'm loving it. I'm almost tempted to keep this for myself. I may have to order one for myself. They are good quality watches."
5,Surprise!,"I was not certain that the IR filter would work,as most digitals have very limited sensitivity to IR, but the canon S5IS is one that it works well with. Delivered quickly, and great product."
5,AWSOME,I odered this and a 30mm as well. Both arrived in great condition and much sooner that I expected.
1,The worst video I have ever seen on fishing!,"This video was a complete waste of money. Beware anyone who is interested in learning about Striped Bass and how to fish them. This video chronicles a day of fly fishing lessons, for a women's group, who have never handled a fly rod before. To me, there is nothing more boring than watching a beginner learn to fly fish on video."
5,Brilliance,"While the book gains its notoriety because of its gambling hook, it's the family stuff that makes this such a terrific read. The brothers Barthelme tell an intoxicating tale of loss."
5,They Should Have Learned to Count!,If the brothershad learned to be efficient card counters they would be writing a book about their wins and not their losses. I might recommend that they read Frank Scoblete's Best Blackjack which I also just reviewed. Is Double Down good? It is excellent because it is a cautionary tale of what can happen when you base your play on adrenaline and not on math.
1,A RED LIGHT FOR SIMPLETONS,"Two brothers named Barthelme lose $250,000 by gambling in a Mississippi roverboat joint .Anything new in the book they got out of this? No. Not a thing . Every fool knows that odds favors the house in legalized gambling .Any message in the book ? Oh. yes . Don't gamble .But the question is: if the brothers were named Smith, and not barthelme, would this book see the light of day ? No . The Barthelmes have a brand name that should have been used for a real look at gambling in a pitifully poor state.A pitiful book that's sure to be made into a movie . That way, the Barthelmes will come out on top ."
4,Terrific memoir,"I suppose I liked the book mainly for its insight into the betting mind. When the Barthelme's tackled the obsessive, self-destructive tendencies of one in the thrawl, the prose hummed and reverberated. The sections on their parents were less successful, not because they were poorly written, but because they seemed to provide a neat excuse for a messy situation. I found their reaction to their mother and father's death poignant, but it read more like a novel (character motivation, et al) than a memoir. But who am I to judge? I still have my parents... The twist at the end was terrific--unnerving and surreal--and the Barthelme's did an excellent job rendering the bizarre circumstances."
4,"Good book, anticlimactic ending","I'm not a gambler, but I agree with the other reviews here that this book provides a wonderful description of the gambling addiction. However, one big flaw is the book's failure to describe the outcome of their criminal prosecution. My understanding is that the case against the brothers was dropped. Why didn't they mention this?"
3,Good story poorly told,"An interesting book for anyone who's ever been addicted, especially to gambling. This work has a major weakness, the lack of an ending, satisfactory or otherwise. The idea that gambling addicts could spend as much time at the casinos as they say they did and not shortchange their employer and students, doesn't ring true. Also, there is no indication that either brother kept a detailed diary during their gambling sprees. The details, amounts, conversations, they supposedly recall for the book are suspect. Still, Double Down is a decent read. The brothers, however, were about the easiest pickings ever to enter a den of gambling. They learned surprisingly little about how to gamble. There is a bookshelf full of better books on the gambling life than this one. For example,Anthony Holden's Big Deal, Andy Bellin's Poker Nation, Jesse May's Shut Up and Deal, Ben Mezrich's Bring Down the House."
4,"Really captivating book, hard to say exactly why","...I think what sets Double Down apart from other fall from grace stories, though, is the style in which it's written. The authors mingle third and first person writing in a very effective way. It really feels like they're both writing every bit of their story together at the same time. And while the prose is not as thick with visual and emotional detail as you usually find in modern novels, that lends it a dreamlike quality that works well with the themes of pretending and avoiding that run all through it.There's no catharsis, no figuring out of anything at any sort of life-changing level, but the book sticks with you...One star short of 5 only because it seems like a 5-star book should give you a something more than an impression to take away with you."
3,"Rambling, Gambling Men","Perhaps if Mssrs. Barthelme dedicated as much of their energies to writing as they do to gambling then perhaps their book wouldn't be as repetitive as it is, no?""Double Down"" meanders and stumbles and needs to be about 50-60 pages shorter. (If you read the excerpt in ""The New Yorker"" then you've experienced the highs and lows of this book without spending the ca$h.) Their moments of pain and clarity and insight are like gems in an otherwise boring story about two lonely, unlikeable guys whose message from all of this strum und drang is as follows: ""Wasting $250,000 isn't a problem unless we say it is.""For as much insight as they claim to have, they could use a little less arrogance, and do with a little more humility."
4,A jewel that's not out of date yet,"Even though this book is rather old, it has complete coverage of the South Bay parks, so far I haven't found anything out of date, and it has features you don't find in other hiking books. Besides distance, time, elevation, and good maps, there's an appendix in the back that groups trails according to season (e.g., shady trails for summer), length, view, history, bicycles, wheelchairs, children, and so on. An extremely useful handbook!"
2,Very disappointing,"Having read and loved ""The Front Runner"" and ""The Fancy Dancer,"" I have to admit that I was very disappointed by this book. The other two I consider literature. This was, I am sorry to say, trash-- it contained a bit of insight into anger and eroticism, but it had no message that had not been conveyed by Warren's other works. If you haven't read the other two, do so by all means. But don't bother with this one."
5,"Excellent Job, PNW!!!","A wonderful extension to the story line to ""The Front Runner"". I wouldn't feel that complete if Billy's story ends up nowhere."
3,Not for the novice,"This book, while explaining in almost graphic detail the complexities of networking, is not for the novice. For the intermediate level user, who wants to know all the ins and outs of networking, the minutia, it should answer any questions you might have."
1,another dust collector,"I knew I wasn't going to like this book as soon as the author complained that 8 bits were an octet, not a byte, and to beware of experts who used the second term ('they've been spending too much time with programmers' he laments). I was thereafter reminded of this unjustifiable and incorrect moaning every time he used the word octet. I would have gotten over it if I had ever been distracted by actually learning something from this book. Some people have a gift for teaching, that is, an ability and desire to explain things well, this author does not. I suspect the author's motive here was primarily to be published."
2,Info is woeful,Do not buy the seal flange that Amazon says folks buy with this toilet. It comes with a flange and new bolts and nuts.!Why oh why cannot the manufacturer say what is included in the box with this item!!!.....and even worse why can't Amazon tell you the same.The toilet is way more flimsy than the Aqua Magic 4 we are replacing....just amazes me that things get more expensive but are of inferior quality. Our old one lasted 13 years!That said it installed fairly easily but watch out if you go from a lo to hi toilet as our water hose didnt line up correctly and I had to get it out a bit to make it fit.All these things led me to give it a 2 star rating.
5,Outstanding,Just what I ordered when I ordered it. A quality product that is just what I expected. Thanks you very much.
2,Too Much Filler,"All throughtout this book Alex Delaware and his police friend Milo never stop ruminating over every new fact they uncover. They have endless discussions on how a new tidbit might fit into the overall picture. The reader longs for the pair to actually do something. In the end the author walks away without even tying up all the main strings. That is really dirty pool after making the reader wade through all the yakking. I read and enjoyed several of the early Alex Delaware books and then quit looking for new ones, now I know why."
3,Average,"I use to be a big fan of the Alex Delaware series.Rage is the newest entry. As you can see, I rated it 3 stars. This book just did not connect with me at all. While all the familiar characters are there, I felt as though there was very little connection between them. The conversations between Alex and Milo felt forced and the main storyline dragged alot.I have been having issues with Kellerman's last few books and this one sealed it for me. He has lost, for me, the ability to entertain me. His characters are stiff and I miss the old ""chemistry"" they had.No more Kellerman for me."
2,Exposition at its Worst,"One of the first things young writers are taught is that you don't tell your reader...you show the reader through action. This book continues the tiresome trend of having Dr. Delaware detail what happened, or at least his assumptions of what happened to Detective Milo...not once but through out the novel.While I admire novels that focus on the psychological profiling and forensic data gathering in crime fighting, I don't expect them to be presented as long winded narratives.There are just better writers out there and I think I'll pass on Kellerman, unless all that's left to read is a James Patterson book."
1,Pure Pain,"This was my first reading of a Kellerman novel, though I'd obviously heard about him for years. I can't imagine a read much more painful than this novel. He is the king of what writers call Talking Heads, just pages and pages of dialogue that go nowhere. He also loves convenience, an absolute deal killer in mystery and suspense. The characters Delaware interviews protest for a few sentences then suddenly realize they better help him. And then there are the pages and pages and pages where he and Milo have to have impossibly mundane dialogue so the author can tell you how the mystery is unfolding...because nothing in the material leads to any mystery of merit. It's also amazing that Kellerman is a psychologist and his character is one as well, and yet so often it is other characters pointing out what even amateur phsychologists or observers of human beings would know. If this is, as the jacket says, ""one of the world's most popular authors"", I need to go in search of the worst sellers."
3,A terrific Dr. Delaware thriller,"RAGE is a terrific Dr. Delaware thriller that grips the audience when Alex recalls (in a flashback) the heinous crime and the reactions of the two teens who committed the murder. Alex is great in this novel especially his asides such as fearing Rand will find another dominant personality to coax him along for a deadly ride. The who-done-it is well designed so that readers know that everyone involved just about believe Duchay deserved death including to a degree Milo and Alex, but they overcome their personal disgust while seeking the killer. Fans of the series will be elated with this Jonathan Kellerman's tale. I give this book five stars not three."
2,Not his finest,"I have read almost all of the Alex Delaware books, and they seem to be on a downhill trend. As another reviewer wrote, this book had a lot of legwork where Kellerman seemed to be establishing his usual tightly-knit plot, and then it all just fell apart at the end. Recently when I see a new Alex Delaware novel I have been getting my hopes up that Kellerman will return to his well written, exciting stories, and have been disappointed each time. I think this is a case of an author who is getting paid to churn out a new book every so often and isn't held to the more rigorous standards that less established authors are held to."
1,"Slow, boring and Drab","Initially, this book was thrilling, exciting and "" unputdownable"". About 120 pages in, it started to draw out, I found this book amazingly boring. I had to close it and leave it closed once I got to about page 220. This book is SNORE material. Cannot believe it was an international bestseller. I do not recommend this book to those who want a thrilling, page turning book. One advantage of this book, it sent me into a snoring comer every night that i read it."
3,Good just not great,"Years ago, I read everyone of the alex delaware books up up to this one..This one is an semi-interesting read but by no means a ""can't put the book down"" type book. Which is unlike most of the alex delaware books as they generally are a 4 to 5 star ordeal. by the end of the book your kinda like.. ok who cares just arrest someone already so I can start the next book. I like that he takes on a controversial subject.. but the characters (other then alex and milo) just felt flat to me. I hope this a fluke and his newer books are better.. But after like 20 excellent books of his.. Im willing to let one slide. On a side note. I hope he brings back Robin.. I dont really care for the allison character.btw.. would love to see an alex delaware movie.. any one else think Oliver Platt would be perfectly cast for milo? For some reason I must have have saw him in a supporting role somewhere and now I always picture milo as him."
1,A Let Down,"I'm not all that familiar with Kellerman's work since I try to stay clear of serial character novels. But my wife, a Kellerman fan, bought the book and suggested I read it. While the pace was mostly okay, two things really bothered me about this book. First is that the author is obsessed with wardrobe. He feels the need to exhaustively describe what many characters wear in each scene down to the last stitch! But the thing that I was most unhappy with is that Kellerman does what I don't recall seeing an author ever do. He walks away from the book. Just ends it with no conclusion! It's as if he decided he wrote the required amount of pages and said, ""Well, that's it!"" and sent it off to the publisher. Two big no-no's for a writer."
3,Multiple murders,"Psychologist Alex Delaware receives a phone call from Rand, a young man who has recently been released from jail. Alex was involved in the case which sent Rand and his friend to jail for murdering a little girl eight years ago. Rand tells Alex that he wants to talk to him about the case, arranges a rendezvous and never shows up. Alex finds that Rand has been murdered and this pulls him back to the old case. He and his police friend, Milo work to find who killed Rand and in the process they uncover a horrific multiple killer whom few would suspect. This book is written in short chapters which speeds up the action, except when Alex and Milo spend too much time speculating over various scenarios for the murders. The other discordant note is the casual way that Alex seems to react to the women who go in and out of his life. They are treated as interchangable and he never appears to invest much emotion in romances whether they are coming or going."
3,Not up to par (but he's not been for some time),"Having read all of Kellerman's books, I feel this one - and the others he's written over the past 3 or 4 years - are not nearly of the same quality of the earlier ones. RAGE started out OK and moved along for about the 1st half ... then was bogged down with all the characters / alternative theories. I'd lost interest by the last 100 pages. Ending was a dud. I wouldn't recommend it."
3,Disappointed,"Like many other reviewers, I felt that the book was going along great until the abrupt ending. It seems to me that Milo and Alex just don't care anymore. Alex seems almost sociopathic in this book, which was very upsetting to me. Also, I agree that Spike has much more appeal that either Robin or Alison, but of the two women I prefer Alison. She doesn't whine or complain and she is capable of taking care of herself and others (remember when she saved Robins whiny butt?). Anyway, I hope Mr Kellerman reverts back to his previous form of excellent plots and great character development."
3,"Okay, but not par for this writer","Alex and Milo are on the case again, this time after the murderer of a child killer, a dimwit Alex evaluated as a juvenile some years before. It's a good mystery, but the author seems off his game. Dialogue is a bit wooden, and I found my attention wandering, unusual for me with a mystery or thriller in hand."
1,"My first J. Kellerman novel. I'll try another one, but...","I'm not a fan of psychologists as protagonists in mysteries and I'm even less interested when they deal with children. Children in peril is not entertaining. That said, however, I picked up ""Rage"" at the airport. And thus, my first Jonathan Kellerman novel.This was a dumb story and far from believable. I could not suspend disbelief. If you read mysteries, the bad guy screams ""IT'S ME! IT'S ME!"" in the first 30 pages. I was hoping I was wrong, but unfortunately, that was not the case. So, I tagged along and watched Alex and Milo chase obvious red herrings, useless leads, eat some donuts, theorize and solve the mystery! I cannot mention how bad I thought the story was without giving away the plot, but let's just say that the antagonists and their behavior is just not believeable over the course of so many years.I'll try an earlier J. Kellerman book. Maybe it will be better?"
3,okay read,"The story was okay, but it ended rather abruptly. It felt like they left the biggest question unanswered. There were several theories posited, but one was never definitively given as the actual explanation."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"This novel will be very popular with dyed-in-the wool environmentalists. As for the story itself, I found it much like a Steven King novel, and I rarely read Steven King. I am a long-time Patterson fan, so I'm disappointed with this one."
3,The ending could have been better :(,"I love reading mystery murder novels. This was my first janathan keller book I've read. A friend insisted I read it and advertised it well. However, I wasn't pleased at the conclusion of the book. It could have been lengthened and brought out more about the killer's reasoning of murdering those characters. I mean, from the beginning to the middle, I was intrigued with finding out who the murderer could actually be. But when I finally got to the end, I was like ""that's it""? Not to tell you the story but even with the part of Milo and Alex sitting in a restuarant after they found Drew Daney...and then not caring about the whereabouts of Barnett or Cherish? I mean, wtf???? I felt that the ending could have been put together a whole lot better. I don't like being left still asking questions about everything else, ya know? I was confused to be honest. It was a great book, but I've read better that had an ending that had you like ""wow""."
2,Not up to Kellerman Standards,"I am a Jonathan Kellerman fan and have read many of his books. Sad to say, I think that RAGE was not up to his usual standards. The plot was endlessly repetitive. Once you read 30 or 40 pages it repeated itself with only a change of the characters' names. It was mostly conversation and little action.The denouement was disappointing and left, in my mind, several unanswered questions"
1,Don't waste your time or money,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. I love whodunits, especially police and spy novels, murder mysteries. But this book was very unsatisfying, spent too much time on describing sorted child and sexual abuse instead of developing a coherent plot. (It borders on child pornography.) There were too many names of too many characters with too many hypothetical subplots to keep everything straight. Even at the end of the book I was unsure of the motive for the crime. Terrible book, Terrible plot. This was not a book or a novel but pure waste paper. It will be a long time before I buy another Kellerman book."
1,My Rage,"How awful was this book. I had more questions than answers. Talk about speculations, and what ending. I wrote the author because I was hoping he could help me clear up some questions I had. He did respond - ""I don't discuss my books"". Therefore, I will no longer buy and/or read his books. That is my own RAGE."
3,Where is the end?,"I have read every Alex Delware novel, this one was well written until the end, it seems Kellerman must have run out of time writing the book and was unable to finish it. The story does not resolve itself, it just stops and most questions remain unanswered."
3,Not as good as the others,"I am a huge fan of Jonathan Kellerman's books. This said, I was a bit disapointed with Rage. The overall story was good. But the ending left me wondering. What really happened? Did I miss something? There was a lot of theories put forth by the main characters, Alex Delaware and his friend Milo. Throughout the story, they speculate as to what was going on but the ending leaves it without proof of... well, anything.I also was upset about the developments brought forth in Alex's love life. I don't want to spoil it for readers but it felt funny, the way things went.SO, I would read it if you are a die-hard fan. Don't buy it in hard cover... You can wait for the paperback! If this is your first novel by Kellerman, don't give up. It's been better!"
1,Not up to Kellerman's usual standard,"Like an earlier reviewer, I still have about 80 pages to go on this book, but at this point I don't really care who done it, what they done, or why. I'm a big fan of the Alex Delaware novels, but the usual strengths of that series are nowhere to be found in this book.Mostly, it's too complicated both in plot and number of characters. I'll read a couple of chapters and six new names are introduced. By the time I pick up the book again, I've forgotten who they are talking about. Some of it is truly gratuitous, such as foster or step-children whose names are different from their parents or guardians. I need this one as an e-book so I could search back and find out who the heck all these people are.If I wanted to work this hard at reading, I'd go dig out War and Peace."
2,Reviews by Nan Kilar and Bobby Miller,"Randolph (Rand) Duchay and Troy Turner, both age thirteen, kidnap and kill a two-year-old girl after trying to get her to puff on a cigarette and drink some beer. Big surprise--she gagged, cried and fussed. Psychologist Alex Delaware was asked by the judge to evaluate each kid and submit his opinion to the judge as to whether they should be tried as juveniles or adults. They're tried and sent off to separate youth detention centers. Troy is dead six weeks later. Rand gets out at age 20 and is dead three days later. However, hours before his death, he called Delaware, asking to meet with him. Alex and his police friend, homicide detective Milo Sturgis, begin investigating Rand's murder. The investigation leads them to all sorts of crazy people, relationships and situations.I've enjoyed Mr. K's past books; but lately he seems to be avoiding the suspense factor in his stories. This book leaves a few loose ends and Alex's love life up in the air."
4,Karma or revenge?,"Psychological thriller with psychologist Alex Delaware, who receives a phone call from a mentally challenged man who has been in prison for 8 years following his taking part in the killing of a toddler; the man simply states that he's not a bad person. However, Delaware attempts to meet with him only to find him dead. When the other teen convicted of the crime, Troy, also turns up dead, Milo Sturgis and Alex Delaware turn their attentions to the other players in this case including an amoral nymphomaniac public defender, ""spiritual counselors"" whose guidance is distinctly amoral and sadistic, and the uncaring parents and foster families of the boys as well as the family of the toddler who was killed. Red herrings abound, and the ending is somewhat ambiguous, but this is a solid thriller."
3,"Good Story, Bad Ending","I liked the story of the book, but was not impressed with the ending. To make a good story you hav to be clear in the ending and the solution of the book. This was the first book I read of his and I don not know yet if it will be my last. I did not even find out who the murderer was."
3,ENJOYABLE BOOK,"This book starts off well and has interesting characters, but for reasons I can't put my thumb on I almost lost interest towards the end. It was almost a little too long, or anticlimactic. Maybe it's the fact htat a psychologist was acting more like a sherif or cowboy then an 'assistant' to the cops. Either way check it out and see what you think. Much better than anything I've read by Patterson, but nowhere near Brad Mettzer!!!"
2,Not up to the usual standards,"OK until the end, then it goes downhill.No resolution, the story just ends.A real disappointment."
5,Essential Reading on the Conflict,"For all those who frame Palestinians as terrorists, this is needed reading. For all those who dehumanize and brush aside the valid desires of Palestinians, this is needed reading.It highlights the effective and responsible activism of the ISM. It proves that non-violence is possible to use against a tremendous military occupation. It should be a model to the world, instead of being ignored, as is happening now, by the Western media.Support Palestine's right to resist occupation. Support the ISM. Help educate yourself and others."
1,Total rubbish with the whole world in upside down mirror.,"Total rubbish with the whole world in upside down mirror. Good is called bad and bad is called good, failures called success and courage to resist darkness called darkness. Cheap shot at public relations campaign..."
1,Don't waste your money...,"This camera is a total disaster. First, Kodak actually took away features such as video capture which used to be available in the 2.0 megapixel model. Second, the camera has a charging defect. I had to send the camera in for repairs because the battery would not charge. Third, the camera has a shutter defect. After a few months, my photos were overexposed and blurry. Again sent camera in for repairs. Kodak fixed the problem temporarily. Finally, a few months later my photos were double exposed and blurry. Kodak would not repair the camera for free because it was out of warrantee. The people at Kodak were nice but their policies suck. Based on the other reviews I have seen on Amazon, it is obvious that this camera should have been recalled.Bottom line - DO NOT TOUCH THIS CAMERA! In fact, I would not recommend you buy a Kodak until they improve their customer service and post sales record."
1,Beware after warranty!,"I enjoyed this camera for the first year. It was bulky, but it was my first digital camera and I enjoyed how easy it was to use. After a year the camera started acting sluggish and buggy. The LCD Screen stopped working, the battery life was sporadic. Sometimes only a three or four shots and it was dead. Talk about missing important photos!! Then one day it locked up on me. Contacted Kodak and for $150 they repaired it. The camera worked well for 2 1/2 months and then I had all of the same problems again. Contacted Kodak and they said sorry the repair warranty is only good for 45 days!! Today I bought a Canon s400 from Amazon. Will not buy from Kodak again!!"
2,No Battery life = blurry pictures,"This camera is easy to use and, when the batteries are charged, takes clear pictures that can be enlarged and print out beautifully.THE PROBLEM: I have not been able to get more than 6 - 10 pictures out of a fully charged and or brand new battery. The charger shows that the battery is fully charged, but once it is in the camera, after a few pictures, the battery power drops to 1/2 then to empty. I've bought 2 extra batteries, thinking maybe my first one was defective, but I continue to have the same problem.Also, when the battery power drops the focus and lighting are affected and the result is blurry dark or overly bright shots until he power runs out.RECCOMENDATION: I would NOT reccommend this camera. If you can only take 6 - 10 shots and 1/2 of them come out blurry, what is the point?"
1,Poor Quality,"Bought camera in April 2002. Worked ok, except battery life was poor. Now I get E12 and E13 error messages and camera locks up. Couldn't find a reference for these codes on their website. Called Kodak and the idiot on the phone didn't know what the error codes stood for. Her only job was to get my credit card info so they can get their $150 to have some tech rep look at it. I told her I was throwing out camera never buying Kodak again. Hope you don't have the same luck with this camera as me."
2,Going back to my 35mm camera,"I bought my DX4900 less than a year ago. I was happy with it when I first bought it but the last several months I've noticed about half the pictures I take come out blurry and very, VERY grainy. I am not doing anything different from when I first bought it, so I suspect the quality just does not last or stand the test of time. Also, from the beginning, the rechargeable battery life has been pathetic. I can take about 17 pictures and then it shuts down because of low battery power~ however, if I set it in the dock it reads that the battery power level is good! I spent $400 on this camera (incl. the dock, as a package deal) and I expected it to last longer than a year. I can't count on my pictures coming out and have lost too many precious moments by using this piece of crap."
2,Don't throw away the 35mm yet,"If it moves, it blurs. That is the draw back of this camera. Color is good, details is okay. Nikon Coolpix does a better job capturing something in motion. I tired to photogrpah objects moving less then 5 mph in outdoor light and it blurred the shots. Low light is another issue for this camera.Battery life is good as long as yo9u don't use the tiny screen on the back. Never use the digital zoom. That goes for any digital camera.This camera is fine for Ebay, but it will not replace the 35mm camera."
3,You can do better,"Short battery life, limited 2X zoom, small view finder which washes out in bright light. Not a bad camera when I bought it about a year ago, but today ""You can do better"""
4,Kodak DX4900 4MP,"I find this camera very easy to use, and am impressed with the quality of the pictures it takes, especially in the larger sizes. The photos are comparable with those taken with much more expensive digital cameras. The only drawback I have found is that it will not take short movies, but the price more than makes up for this."
3,Good camera but need a card reader,"On the whole, a good camera for the price with one serious limitation. For some reason, Kodak has decided to stop letting the DX series of cameras write from the computer to the compactflash card. You need a separate card reader to add files to the card."
4,Kodak Dx4900,"Overall I am very pleased with the camera. The software is easy to use. I purchased the camera dock with the camera, right out of the box, the power supply was defective and after 20 minutes of filling out the required forms & photo copying receipts and sending the old power supply back I recieved a replacement power supply in just a couple of days. In my opinion the rechargable battery that comes with the camera dock is junk, I was only able to take 3 to 4 pictures before going into ""Low Battery"", purchasing new batteries resolved this problem.I like to think I did my research on the 4.0 MP cameras and for the price you can't beat it."
5,Very happy from the start,"I bought this camera when it first came out. I paid a little more than $400.00. I bought all of the accessories inclulding the additional lens kit. Even today, the picture quality is fantastic. The only downside that I have found is the battery life. I clean the inside of the battery compartment and it seems to help the charge life. I never had an issue with picture quality. Never noticed any blur, fuzz or darkness. Maybe if you have your fingers on the flash or you have uncontrollabe shaking hands you could have these picture quality issues. I would not compare this camera to the cameras of today but, I have to say that I made a good choice on this one."
5,Great!,What a great camera for those of you who want really high quality picture at a great price. You can't beat this!
1,Choose another camera.,"The battery is terrible. The Camera is way to fat. And the viewer is impossible to see in the sunlight. However, the pictures are very good and the dock works great. BUT... The camera will only take max 15 pictures on a complete charging--I have a lemon of a camera and Kodak, while polite and avaliable, has not given me a new camera. I can not reccommned this camera to anyone."
4,great camera,"Great camera with a good price. Its Very easy to use and takes extremely crisp, clear pictures. The dock is great to keep your batteries charged and you need at least a 128mb card. I wish the camera came with better zoom...but once i bought the additional telephoto lens, i was not disappointed at all. Can't go wrong with this camera."
4,Easy to use,"We bought this to go around the edge of the patio doors. It was very easy to install and works perfectly.The sticky side is *very* sticky, so make sure you are ready to put it in place immediately."
2,Disapointed,"After hearing how steve could play w/Skynyrd I felt this CD fell short of what he was capable of. I have great respect for Steve Gaines, he was a great musician. I just didn't care for this CD. Lots of jazzy kind of pop stuff in this. Only listened to it once though may grow on me- will give it more of a chance."
3,ROCKSTEADY? NOT READY!,"First of all I LOVE Rocksteady. However, this Documentary/Concert was laking. The video quality was great and so was the audio but where are all of the Rocksteady Greats? They all cannot be dead. Maybe there was contract issues. Anyway, I think that the Documentary part of the disc was the best part. It allowed for you to get a sense of what that era was like and to see some how Jamaica looks today. The problem with the Concert is many of the people who was in the Documentary part of the Disc was not in the Concert. They just used the biggest names from that era to perform. Also, the Concert only lasted about an hour. How can you leave U-Roy or Derrick Morgan out of the Concert? I quest we should just be happy with what we got. Over all great looking disc but not enough representation of this great time in Jamaican music history."
2,Farm Aid deserves better,"A letdown musically, with a couple excellent songs -- mostly by the always spirited Neil Young. Willie Nelson hams up the chorus of an otherwise superb ""City of New Orleans"" but redeems himself on a duet with Beck. Johnny Cash is typically enjoyable, but if you're a fan I'm sure you already own several versions of ""Folsom Prison Blues.""Other than that it's a lot of expendable contemporary country and lite rock. Supports a great cause though. Buy it to help family farmers or if you are desperate to possess these live versions."
5,Sunflowers,One of my favorites. Stocked up to take to Florida for the winter. Hard to find in stores...price were much better online.
1,Big problem with OBD.......Check Engine Light comes on!!,"Great product that worked to solve my pinking knocking problem while towing a boat or trailer. The only problem is the lower temperature made my check engine light come on. I cleared it but after a few days the same code came back and tripped the light. The code was ""engine too cold too long"" meaning the OBD computer knew the temp was cooler but thought it was a malfunction. No way to get the light to stay off. Ignored it until I had to get a smog check and it would not pass because the check engine light has to be reset and the vehicle driven 75 - 100 miles before the smog station computer will pass the vehicle. I had to remove it and replace the stock one to get my truck smogged. Hyper Tech customer service said they knew of the problem and to change it back to stock. I am very disappointed because the Hyper Tech stat made my truck run better."
3,good show not the greatest,"I really purchased this show for only about 30 to 45 seconds(separate story of no interest to anyone). However I did watch all the dvds because I did enjoy the show. I think shows such as this one holds up very well over time. The actors were all very good, story lines were sometimes very forced(how many times can you have single women trying to find a husband to be written differently)and having children and their problems to be found interesting.Shows like this come down to the characters as played by the actors, which in this case does make this show.If the program has not be seen before I think anyone will enjoy these dvds. If you remember seeing the show then you will be a person who enjoyed the actors and characters and will enjoy seeing it again. The purchase price was very important for me and was in the end a good buy.The two leading actress' are very good and the remaining cast all do a very good job."
1,Returned,"I bought this TV based upon my trust of the Sony brand and the very good rating it got in Consumer Reports. I haven't bought a new TV in 14 years so I was pretty excited about my new purchase. When I hooked it up to my DirectTV (non-HD), I was crest fallen. The picture was horrible. My wife's cheapo old-school Sanyo is way more pleasing to watch. The imperfections in the picture are so blatant that you have to sit 10 feet back to not be constantly annoyed by them. My advice is not to be tempted by any close-out deals on this TV as they try to clear it out for the new model."
2,Trusted Sony and Now Very Disappointed,"I purchased and have watched the KLVS26A10 for 6 months and have adjusted and modified all I can and it simply is not a good product. It is inconceivable that Sony would put out a bad product like this...there should be a recall of it. The facts: The picture is not good for live/recorded shots of people...there is little definition or depth of facial characteristics. Every person appears like they have pancake make-up--like the image has been air-brushed of all definition. For me, these situations make up 50% of what I look at. I was so trusting of Sony, that I assumed I was at fault and either had the wrong cables, cable connections or couldn't tune it properly. All the best cables and fine tuning the color/image/light balance is of no avail. I was taken by the Sony name and by Crutchfield's claim...and I quote from their catalog ""...Bravia is...a guarantee from Sony that you'll enjoy years of supurb picture quality...."" Enough said"
3,content,The format of each page is not the best for writing a synopsis of vacation stay at a vacation cottage.
3,A Bit Disappointed,I bought this little book so friends could note their experiences while at our beach house. I love the illustrations; very beachy!What I'm missing is space where people can freely write how they feel about the time they spent there rather than answer pre-printed questions. A blank page between each visitor would be perfect. Not everyone is there for the same reason.I bought one for my sister too and she felt the same way.
5,Perfect for the Beach Guest House,"I saw this book at a beach rental in Delaware. It was a delight to read how the tenants had spent their time. The questions cutely solicit information from the tenants. The only thing missing is a specific question on restaurants. There is plenty of room to write, and the tenants created their own section for restaurants."
5,Delicious cooking made easy,"The thing I love about this book is that it's EASY! Unlike most Indian cookbooks the recipes are simple and quick, especially for a novice cook like myself. Since I don't like to spend too much time in the kitchen this book is a godsend. I highly recommend it."
3,Average,Dissapointed. Expected more Chettinad recipees. Recipees are very ordinary and presentation is average.
3,cd o.k.,"this cd has fun songs, but the case was broken and the sound quality is low so I have to turn up the sound in order to hear it loudly."
5,Wee sing,this has been a favorite since my children were small and I taught preschool.I gave it as a baby gift and the older child is already learning the songs and singing to his baby sister.
4,An Old Management Book - AMS Methods,"The author will teach you aggressive methods that he refers to as AMS methods. Some of the topics covered are:1. Be aggressive without altering your personality.2. Problems are opportunities.3. Accept interruptions, but control them.4. A start-in-the-middle technique to overcome initial paralysis5. You get what you inspect, not what you expect.6. The care and feeding of monkeys on your back.7. Learning about the Kobert Wheel.8. The purpose of filing is retrieval - not filing.9. How you should be treated on returning from a meeting.(Home)"
5,Fabulous!,Fabulous kids show! Love the lesson learned! Loved the crafts. Very user friendly format! Very funny! Are there more to come?!?!
4,Jovenes del Muelle,"""Jóvenes del Muelle"" also known by its Chorus line: ""Amalia llegó a las nubes y seguirá"" is one of my favorite songs of that era. It has a great swing, rhythm and beat. I consider it a timeless classic. You can listen to it now (it's a real pity the album has not been reissued in CD format) and it compares very favorably to today's Salsa. It's one of those songs that I can listen to and it automatically transports me to a dream state. Sort of the state some say is attained by long meditation. The same kind of feeling I get listening to some of Eddie Palmieri's records.I lived that era in a place that had many NewYoricans, and this was a great record to listen to by all because it was in Spanish but the music by Harlow had an unmistakable New York Salsa feeling to it. So it had something to please everybody. Let's hope it's reissued."
1,I hated this chair,"First of all, let me just say that these types of chairs are horrid. front facing makes it impossible to feed baby without making a mess, you can't turn him/her to face you, so food gets everywhere! I was also disappointed in the seat itself. It has a snap which holds it to the head support, and the snap keeps comming undone, which makes baby lean forward. I thought it was difficult to put on the table, because I have a round table that opens up to insert a leaf. There wasn't a good place for the legs of the chair to hook up underneath. All in all, a waste of money in my opinion. I ended up buying another seat that installs on my kitchen chair, and it's turned out to be a much much better choice."
2,Save your money,I bought 2 of them so my teens could learn from but in the end it would have been easier to teach them to just make a couple of angled cuts. The metals brackets ARE NOT put together as the photos make them look like. You have to piece them together.
3,"Great idea, could be a little sturdier","A landscape architect and I built this using the directions. This is not something he normally does, so would be like an average homeowner building it. The idea is great, but the metal pieces bend and flex a little too much. The floor calls for 1/2"" plywood which flexes. It should be marine grade 3/4"" plywood, particularly if you're not putting it on a slab. The braces that hold the upright 2X4's attach to the sill plate. This means that when you go to put on the outside sheathing, you can't get a good seal against the plate.We built it onto a 6"" concrete slab. However, the person who poured, put a slope on it, which he shouldn't have done. In all fairness, it did complicate the job.If I were going to do this again, I'd hire a carpenter who could make the angled cuts."
4,Upgrade's,"this CPU has been great for me, over 7 years. now i would like to know, what type of CPU I can upgrade to for faster processing."
4,Good but a little outdated.,"This book is nicely organized and well-written, but many people may be better served by online tutorials or a more modern book on their specific OS/distribution. I bought this because a course I'm taking requires us to ssh into the University's Linux server and program in the *nix environment. This book is great for learning your way around a free shell, the terminal of your favorite distro, or even cygwin. However if you are looking for a book to teach you to use a modern Linux distro, complete with GUI, this is probably not the book for you. And since much of this info is available on the net, I wouldn't recommend paying the list price."
3,Unix beginner's guide,The book is OK at a very rudimentary level. I thought it would be more comprehensive.
2,Who are these people????,"Being a connoisseur of all things ""rave"", I could not wait to see another attempt at another video portrayal of Ecstasy Culture. Not that I expected much really. I have been constantly disappointed by these types of releases before. So far the only movie of this genre that has satisfied has been Human Traffic. This one and all others fall short.The problem with this one is that there is no character development. After 40 minutes, you still don't have any interest in them or what happens to them. The movie only gives you a glimpse into their lives for a moment and then you see them partying. Nothing else. Also, the foreshadowing is a bit much here. It isn't too hard to determine what is going to happen next in the film. If you have the money to spend and you HAVE to see it, then go ahead, but be warned that if you have seen any other crappy rave movie, then you have already seen this one."
5,annin 20 foot aluminum flag pole,Very durable looks great flying in the wind . Had to replace flag had it for over 15 years stong winds finally broke it
1,"It says made in U.S.A., that only pertains to the flag. The pole and everything is made in China",The truck on the top of the pole was not properly threaded all the way through. There is no paperwork or phone number to report missing or defective parts. Your only recourse is to contact amazon and ship the entire set back for refund or replacement.
3,"Works, Well made. Cheap flag.","The kit works well. I decided to GLUE the sections together with gorilla glue because if you don't, the flag pole tends to wobble at each section. Looks real sloppy. When I glued it, it is solid. The flag is very cheaply made and does not last long, so figure on buying a quality flag soon."
4,MY AMERICAN FLAG,"I was looking for a flag an pole and i spoted this one so i payed for it. They told it would take 7 to 10 days , but it only took two days to get here . The only thing i worry about is high wind , now i put a 20ft. section PVC 1""an QT.If its to bad i take the flag down.I fly my flag every day in good weather. I am a Vietnam Vet.I fly my flag for the 56,000plus that did not come home. So buy this flag an pole. WE ARE AMERICANS...............I love watching my FLAG fly as i seen it fly in Battle.I got my Flag and pole at AMAZON.COMNOW MEN FOR YOUR PRETTEY WIFEShany Deluxe Makeup Kit, Travel, 51 CountRothco Camo Outdoorsman Rucksack[ Claddagh Real Diamond Pave Pendant Necklace Solid 14K White Gold Womens Irish by Pompeii3 ]]"
5,Great Buy!,"My husband put a flag we already had onthe new pole the day we received it. Easyassembly, installation and flagpole issturdy.Neighbors called soon after to say how niceit looked!"
2,Too flimsy if you have wind...,Had high hopes after reading the reviews but this pole only lasted about a month before it bent. We have strong gusts on occasion but I would have hoped to get at least a year out of this. That's not the case. Spend more money and buy a more durable pole if you have ANY concerns that your home or yard is windy.
1,"D-Link DCS-1110 isn't horrible, but has issues with stability, isn't well supported by the vendor, and is now discontinued.","I have two of these cameras monitoring my front and back door while being powered over Ethernet. They work OK most of the time, but periodically they both simply stop working. It requires a ""reboot"" (power off, power on) to get them working again (which I cannot do remotely, and I do not have direct access to them since I'm using them for surveillance). I have been unable to find any acknowledgement of the stability issue online, and D-Link support was of no help when I spoke to them on the phone. There has not been a firmware upgrade to this device EVER, and it is now discontinued. I feel like I'm on my own, that I bought two cameras which don't work as advertised, and I'm now stuck with them without hope of ever having the issue corrected. Avoid this camera."
4,Big improvement over the stock speakers,"At $69 a pair, these are a good speaker deal, but I paid $47 and they arrived within the week. They pump a lot of sound with few watts input. The tweeter is a bit sharp, but I understand they require a few days of service to mellow out. Regardless, these represent a tremendous improvement over the stock speakers. NOTE: They do not come with a speaker harness. You will have to cut the factory wires and solder to install them. Or you can order a speaker harness for your particular vehicle to make your life easier."
3,Mediocre,"For men with thick beards, this razor will not work. I went through a brand new razor head after shaving a week old beard because the razor became clogged. On top of that, the razor hardly removed hair from my lower chin and neck. I finished my shave with my Gillette m3 power and the beard was history. I noticed something too - the Gillette razors are sharper, yet they do not cut your skin or leave razor burn.This razor also kept clicking as I shaved, on account of the awkward way the razor heads are attached. Also, the base used to hold the razor does not stand up so it isn't ideal for those wanting to save cabinet space.Update: I do have to say that the blades stay sharper than the Gillette's."
2,"Decent camera, except for one ""thumb-wearing"" problem.","I think this is a decent camera for the money, except for one annoying design that will probably cause me to return it. The switch to turn the camera on is EXTREMELY difficult to move with your thumb. The design is for your right hand to go through the hand strap, and your thumb to be able to rotate the On/Off switch.Unfortunately, the switch is circular with no protruding edges to facilitate turning it (which my Sony Hi-8 has). Hence, it requires a significant amount of thumb pressure and friction to move, and often I find myself going right past the Off state into the Play state. Since I have to use this feature everytime I use the camera, poor design here is unacceptable."
1,defective!!!,"I had the camcorder for about a year and then BANG, this whinding noise starts to happen... I can't record with it anymore... It seems with the slightest touch, it makes a whinding noise and tottally destroys the image... This product was a great deal... Too bad it doesn't work! ..."
1,do not buy!!!!,"it broke the third time we used it. no power, nothing. now the labor warranty is expired and the tape is stuck inside! do not nuy no matter how great the deal. you will buy buy a peice of excretory waste."
1,Searching for another camera,"Its funny hearing all these reviews on this camera. The problem listed in earlier reviews about the camera having focusing problems. I too have had similar problems. It almost seems like the video feed stalls slightly when panning out, or tilting the camera to one side or downward. I received my first camera and right out of the box it was so bad it did not function. My replacement I have had for about 3 months, and now similar problems are arising. After contacting JVC they said they had no idea about any kind of problem and said I would need to pay to ship the camera and get it evaluated. I asked to speak to the representatives supervisor and was promptly hung up on. Now I am the last person to cause any kind of fuss in a company and rarely do anything like this at all. But this has left such a bad taste in my mouth, that I will never again deal with JVC as a company."
4,Satisfied,"This is my first camcorder so I really couldn't do much comparison. So far, I am satisfied with the image/sound quality and I sucessfully downloaded the video to my PC with Win2000/1394 card/Ulead Videostudio 6.0."
4,Not-quite clear instructions,"The product was fine, delivered in a reasonable time. No complaints with the vendor. The manufacturer however should include clearer instructions. At one point it says ""repeat above"" but it doesn't mean repeat everything above, just a few steps before it. A clearer way would be to say, ""repeat steps 4,5,6 (x,y,z, etc, etc.). We finally got it and it works fine so far."
5,Bigwig's 4th album,"This is the 1st Bigwig album that I ever purchased. After hearing this, I had to get all 3 of their previous releases. This band seems to get better with every successive album. Tight and fast with lots of harmonious fury and great lyrics. It's nice to make out most of the words without a lyric sheet, too. Imagine vintage Slayer as a punk band without all the devil crap, that's very close to what Bigwig sounds like on this CD."
2,great for someone with a tiny head!,This thing barly fits around my head. Everytime I put it on I feel like my head is being squeezed so tight it is going to explode! I do not reccomend this product.
3,Full of emotions.,"I really enjoyed this book because, even though it is fiction, the life and the way things were done in that time are factual. It is describing a true way of life, and the way a certain group of people lived during that time, and how they related to each other.The book is very factual to that way of life, and time. The book has all the emotions, of excitement, humor, romance, passion and moments of breathtaking suspense. There were times I could not put the book down. The scenic descriptions were so detailed, it was easy to see the picture in your mind.As a senior adult, I really enjoyed this book. I recommend this book for all ages above 13."
2,False advertising!,"iLife '04 is advertised by Apple as being a suite of software packages: iTunes, iMovie, Garage Band, and iPhoto. I bought it in hopes of restoring iMovie 4 which had crashed and no longer functioned. When I tried to install the program, it was unavailable (as was iTunes). It took some digging through Help to discover that if you had upgraded the OS X operating system from Panther, you could not restore iMovie - and were encouraged to upgrade to a later version of iLife! The problem with that is the newer versions only work with more powerful processors; in other words, you need a new computer too. The only solution was to back up all my files and reinstall OS X, losing all the web bookmarks and software upgrades in the process. It took more than 4 hours to accomplish this tedious process :( Apple clearly does not care about customers using older products."
1,iCrash,"This is a huge step back for Apple's iApps, particularly iPhoto, which is an absolute disaster in this release. We typically cannot launch iPhoto without crashing unless we trash three catalog files. Importing more than once a day is impossible - the app says it cannot access .../iPhoto Library/month/date the second time you try to import.Add to that the continued game of keep-away with iDVD, which will not work with external DVD burners. If you bought anything less than the highest-end Macs, or models like the Cube or iBook that have never had built-in DVD burners as an option, well, too darn bad! Kind of obviates the coolness of FireWire when peripherals are deliberately not supported by Apple.Crashing and losing user data is NEVER acceptable. Apple, more than anyone, is supposed to know this. The company should be absolutely ashamed of this pathetic product, and should not offer it for sale until they work out the bugs and stop being such jerks about DVD burning."
5,Great Beachcombing Guide,"I have 4 of my glass float treasures that I have found on the central Oregon coast, and a bunch more that my husband beach combed in Alaska, and Walt's books have been a great help in identifying our finds. It's really amazing the research he's done. Anyone who's into glass floats and beachcombing on the West Coast these are a must!"
5,LOVE IT - LOVE IT,Ive been looking for a spray on foundation but most are so expensive and never match me. I'm in my later 50's and my skin is very light. It works so beautifully and makes my skin look like there isn't any red tones in it. For the first time I have a true matt finish with no cakey look and it wears all day.
5,Review of coffee press,the coffee press was everything described. I received it quickly. It makes great coffee and looks great on my countertop.
3,Thermal?,"I like the design a lot, although it was somewhat larger than expected. It makes a good cup of coffee, as it should, and I love that fact that it's virtually unbreakable. However, I'm disappointed with it's thermal properties or lack there of. A little insulation between the walls and in the lid would make all the difference!"
5,Thermal Coffee Press,The La Cafetiere Thermique is beautiful on the table and works perfectly to keep the coffee nice and hot. Also it will not crack and break like the glass ones.
1,Disappointed,"Upon unpacking this coffee pot, the lid already was dented.The lid also evidenced cloudy patches of stainless steelthat did not polish up with a soft cloth. I am seriouslydispleased and unwilling to give this product a try.Back it goes, and I am not happy to pay the return charges!We'll see what Amazon.com can do for me. I am a loyal customer.Update: Amazon online customer service was flawless. I amvery pleased with not paying to return a defective item.I paid nearly double for a similar item to replace it viaAmazon. That coffee press is far superior in every way.I am a happy customer!"
3,Nice press if you can live with holes.,"This is my second press. The first one had a hole on the inside near the pour spout. I returned that one due to the sanitary issues. This one has a pin hole in the bottom. You hear air whistling out when you pour the hot water in. All in all its a good press for the money. Looks good, works good, all stainless steel. You would think they would test them for leaks in the factory though. I am not returning this one because it works and I do not want to be without a press again as I wait for Amazon to send me a different one that might have a hole in a worse spot."
2,eh.,"Our household has gotten into the morning ritual of grinding coffee and doing the coffee press routine. Our glass press coffee gets cold too fast for my drinking speed, so I did a little research on line to see if I could find a warming carafe and press combined into one. After reading other reviews, this press seemed to be the ticket. So far, we are not impressed. The coffee does stay warmer a little while longer but not a lot longer, and the unit has a nice design, so it's pretty to have on the kitchen counter next to the toaster.....but we keep getting TONS of coffee grinds in the pressed coffee. I never had this problem with any other press. Not sure what the deal is. Also, 8 cups might sound like a lot of coffee, but I guess for my boyfriend and I, it is NOT. We end up making a couple of pots a day.So, I feel a little like it was a waste of $50.I'm a little disappointed."
1,Don't Bother!,"My son was so looking forward to getting this vehicle to add to his Star Wars collection. We just purchased it this afternoon and I will be bringing it back this evening. The large side wheels constantly detach from the center firing piece. One of the wheels was not moving very smoothly, and half the missiles do not lock in place so they fall out with the slightest bit of movement. (Only the top rows of missiles fire. The bottom half serve as ""storage."") My son attempted to play with it for a half hour and he was nothing but frustrated. Don't waste your time and money. I bet you can find something much better."
2,It was not worth waiting for. I am very disappointed,I expected a new and improved Print shop with new graphics. I recieved it today and found numerous pictures that I used in the print shop at least 6 years ago. I felt like I was using the old print shop on my Apple IIgs. It has many similarities to the old System 9 print shop which was not overly impressive. Do not waste your money on this program. Invest in Print Explosion it has much better and a larger selection of graphics.
1,Wait for the new OS X EDITION!,I just got the new OS X Print shop for Mac. It'll be for sale shortly. Worth the wait! Really works slick an is somethingMac users have needed a long time. Watch for it ......
1,Go to this site to learn about THE PRINT SHOP OS X version,"This is not compatible with OS X. To find out more about THE PRINT SHOP OS X VERSION, go to http://www.mackiev.com/printshop/index.html."
1,Buyer Beware!,"This Print Shop for Mac does not work on the current Mac OS. All of the positive reviews for this product are from the OS 8 and 9 era. The ad is misleading and I believe it is purposely so. The seller will not refund the entire cost. You will be stuck with postage buying and returning product.The ad states that it is for Mac. The system requirements say that it is Macintosh. If you don't peel it down another layer you will be lead to believe that it will operate on current Mac OS. Even Amazon's review states that it will work with OS X , but IT DOES NOT WORK WITH THE LATEST MAC OPERATING SYSTEM (Leopard). Beware of this and all products from the seller. The seller is aware that he is currently selling a ""bad"" product.He believes that the customer is always WRONG. Read his comments in customer reviews to get an idea of what you will be faced with if you have a problem."
2,A very dated product,"No OSX support, and very slow on a 700 mhz G4 eMac. I've also found the saved files to be unstable and easily corrupted unless you reboot in OS9.If you're using up to date software, this package is going to be a disappointment to you - it would have seemed okay under 8.6 but it's very dated now."
1,PrintShop Mac,This is an old version and is not workable on any current operating system of Mac. I think it was truly only useful on an ancient Apple computer.
3,Didn't get it,"Owing to the inept delivery system of the US Postal Service, I never received PrintShop. The sender got it back in damaged condition apparently, and very quickly issued me a credit. I will perhaps re-order to see if some other deliver system might be better."
2,Hurry up please with OS-X Print Shop,"As a new user of Apple equipment, I am amazed that there are noreally good printing programs for Mac OS-X. I really love theiMac I just got. Best computer I've ever owned! But, there are lots of good printing programs for Windows ie: Printmaster Gold, etc. I'm glad I saved my old PC and will use it for printing posters, cards, etc. till someone gets with it and comes up witha good Mac OS-X program ...... then I'll trash my old PC."
4,A rather nice Zoid,"First off, Battle Cougar is a gryphon; no cougar I've ever seen has talons, wings, and a beak. Of course, he is listed as ""Griffon Type,"" but the name does irk me. That being said, this is a rather nice Zoid. I'd compare it in difficulty to Shadow Fox. It doesn't have the smooth articulation of Konig Wolf or Liger Zero, but for what joints it has, it walks well. The wings are poseable and the beak opens and closes. I'd have liked to see a separate piece for the hind feet rather than the leg being one solid piece, but it still works well. For a smaller motorized Zoid, Battle Cougar is easy to put together and looks good when assembled and moving, if bright and somewhat gaudy in color."
2,Battle Loser,"This Zoid stinks! Its way over priced,its small,its slow,and the only good thing about it is that its a zoid,which means it has lots of detail. It took me longer to build BrachioZilla than it did to build this. Do not buy this unless you want a easy to build,small beginners Zoid or, if you are a zoid collector.Buy BrachioZilla instead, its cheaper and better!"
5,Hasbro's Battle Cougar!,"This zoid is very cool. When you turn it on, it's walks. You can pose the wings and mouth however you want. The yellow and red color scheme looks great on him. There is also an action figure of this zoid out in stores."
3,"A Nice Introduction, but Only That","For what it is -- a very short book with a lot of pictures and a sketchy text -- this is not a bad book. Arguably it's a nice place to dip your toe into the subject to see if it's worth pursuing in more detail. As is generally the case with whatever Osprey series you're reading, the book is written in a dry, clinical style and largely lacks the flow and rhythm of an historical narrative. Still, if you want a quick overview, it's not bad, and to the extent that that is its purpose, it succeeds. Those who want more detail, background and context, however, will have to look elsewhere for something with more meat on its bones than this."
2,a shpping list of what not to do,"This is a shopping list of things that could and have gone wrong with Mr. Sutton's many jobs of management. I appreciate the listings, but really felt there is no flow to this book, no continuity to the title."
4,A very good checklist for the restructuring professional,"I am an insolvency practitioner and found the book easy to read and very instructive. It has been very useful to me as a ""how to"" handbook for addressing informal restructuring assignments."
1,Lousiest book on turnarounds,"Ive read a lot of business books but this one ranks at the bottom. It wasnt written: it was most probably taped during the authors spare time i.e. commuting in traffic, traveling etc. The book has advice like ""attack drugs and alcohol at work..."".Some chapters, like the last, ramble on with no real objective. Ive never returned a book to Amazon but there always a first"
4,Hard to Guess WHO,I kept changing my mind as to who could have done it. Also liked the poision conncection as I have friend to is a toxicologist.
4,Engaging,Good character development and good plotting = good reading. I look forward to reading more of this series in the future.
3,One coffee with,"I knew nothing about this series of books or the author before reading this book. I started to give it two stars but raised it to three when I found out it had been written so long ago (1982) which makes certain things I found objectionable more understandable.As a 'mystery', this was fine. My problem was with the characters. The 'beautiful swan' that thinks she's an 'ugly duckling' is rather cliched (though perhaps less cliched when the book was written). More importantly, the obigatory 'romance' seemed to be shoved in rather haphazardly. The book feels very dated."
4,One coffee only?,"This book started out slowly. There were lots of characters tossed out, with lots of background on each. Pair that with lots of art history details and I had to wade through. I'm glad I stuck it out, though. Eventually the story line picked up as some of the characters faded into the background. Toward the end I was sorry to see things wrapped up. I liked the strong female detective (Sigrid) and would read another book with her character."
3,one coffee with by margaret maron,"The story itself was ""okay"" in terms of a plot but it sounded dated and as if written from a perspective & in the style of someone living in the 1950's. Maybe this was intentional but it came across as dated and unrealistic."
5,Ivy Covered Walls,"I love the introduction, the explanation of the writing process and the technical progress from typewriters to computers. The diminishing outlets for short stories and the politics of university departments are sad, but true . . ."
5,Great book- Super helpful!!,"This book was so helpful when my now husband and I were going through the process of getting a fiancé visa. It helps to explain each step that needs to be taken, which is a huge helps as the BCIS does not offer this information. It gives you tons of information and resources that is a huge help and gives you a sense of ease through the stressful, long and expensive process of immigration. I highly recommend this book- it is worth it for peace of mind! I also found a lot of help from contacting my local representative's immigration department, who helps with finding out the status of your case, has access to immigration phone numbers and also can answer any additional questions that this book doesn't answer."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Wow ... Does the first reviewer actually play poker ??? I can't believe I spent money on this DVD ... First off, the quality of the video itself is basically the same as if you recorded it on a camcorder and ported it to DVD ... Terrible lighting, cheesy characters, backgrounds and music, and sound like what you get when you're recording those high school sports shows on local access cable channels ...Getting beyond the low quality of the video, the content is brief, introductory (at best) and easily found within 5 minutes on the internet ...Nope, I cannot believe I spent $14 on this video ... The Binion's have been important in the poker world, but this video is a complete waste of time and money ... Beware if you buy it, you WILL be dissappointed ...Layne, Layne, Layne, I can't believe you put your likeness to this project ... And, please, you may have won back-to-back WSOP tournies, but please don't make back-to-back DVDs this bad ..."

5,Living Longer Stronger: 6-Week Plan to Enhance & Extend Your Years 40,Great book. Valuable and reliable information.
3,pretty good,The diet and weight training information in this book are well explained and pretty solid. People will see results following this program. My only gripe is the authors vehement opposition to aerobic excercise. A complete fitness program should include both resistance training and aerobic activity.
5,"The fastest, most effective way to gain muscle and lose fat","I have used the exercise and diet programs in Dr. Darden's books with hundreds of clients, and have gotten results that literally must be seen to be believed (which is why Body Defining contains standardized before and after photographs of real people who went through the program). I highly recommend any of Dr. Darden's books to anyone interested in improving their physical appearance and condition in the fastest, safest, most effective manner possible. Andrew M. Baye The Exercise Specialist Altamonte Springs, FL"
1,"Está en decadencia, qué pena","Sinceramente admiro mucho a Myriam, sus discos anteriores han sido fantásticos. Pero este disco es el peor de su carrera. El estilo Britney Spears de sus coreografías en Leña y Fuego y Quién cuidará de mi, se los dejaría a artistas adolescentes, pero no a una señora como Myriam. Los temas lentos son monótonos y suenan igual a los antiguos. La versión en español del tema de Richard Marx es malísima. Menos mal que el disco tiene sólo diez canciones, porque sino, sería peor. Realmente me gusta mucho Myriam, por eso me gustaría que su próximo álbum fuera diferente."
5,Good album,"This album is excellent, great dance music to work out too, great ballads that contain powerful words and melodies to remember. I catch myself even quoting some of the lyrics in my everyday conversation that is how much I love this album. Definitely worth getting it, especially if your a Myriam Hernandez fan. A must have for the collection"
1,Only if there was a NO STAR option..,I bought this for my cat. This are more for dogs. My cat thought the treat was a toy. It is reallllllly big and very harrrrrd. I couldnt even cut through the treat with a knife. I would not buy this again.
1,old wine in new skin,"I bought This House Has Fallen: Nigeria in Crisis (Maier, 2003) after reading This house has fallen: Midnight in Nigeria (Maier, 2000). To my surprise, the texts were identical, save for the title and cover picture. Was it the intention of the publishers and the author to reproduce the 2000 publication word for word under a different title? I hope not, but I look forward to hearing from them on this medium since I have not been able to reach them otherwise."
3,Not bad,"Some of the Biographies are combined like The Munsters and The Addams Family. There are times when you hear the sound of a clip, but it's just a still picture. WTF??"
3,"Good out of doors, poor using a flash","I've been a life-long Nikon user going back to the Nikormat. I upgraded to the D70 since I have a number of Nikon lenses, I thought it logical to purchase the D70. While the pictures taken out-of-doors are very good to excellent, using the internal flash indoors is very disappointing. When I need flash pictures I use the Canon G2 which produces excellent results, while the D70 is consistently under-exposed. I sent the camera back to Nikon for analysis. They found nothing wrong, stating I needed to by the external SB-600 flash. I fail to understand why virtually all other digital cameras come with a proper internal flash. (Has anyone else had this issue?)"
1,Poor Quality No Support from Nikon,"This was a marginally ok camera when we bought it but it had a bunch of problems and finally died. Nikon refused to support or repair it. Thanks to my experience with this camera, I refuse to buy ANY Nikon product - they are not a reputable trustworthy company -- they have poor quality and non-existent customer service."
2,A serious flaw of light metering,"The Nikon D70(s) has a serious flaw of light metering for under-exposure. The Nikon customer support may tell you under-exposure is better than over-exposure because under-exposure keeps details of the picture. It is true. But under-exposure also introduces noise and usually cannot reach the expected color saturation. How serious is the Nikon D70(s) under-exposure problem? I talked to my friends who have Nikon D70(s). The under-exposure of Nikon D70(s) is from -1/3 to -1. In my case, my Nikon D70(s) is -2/3. Can Nikon fix it? I sent my Nikon D70(s) for repair. It came back with the same problem. To the worst, the under-exposure is not linear. For example, I need to set +2/3 to get 0. But I need to set -1 1/3 to get -2/3. (You can test it by yourself by shooting Kodak 18% gray card).Other functions of Nikon D70(s) are good."
2,"Great photos, poor durability, no support","I am an amateur photographer who stretched a few years back to buy a Nikon D70 based on Nikon's reputation for quality and durability. The camera has taken great photos, but recently had a shutter failure that Nikon is charging over $200 to fix. Research shows this is a known issue with the Nikon D-series - no matter how good the images, if the camera only lasts a couple of years in light use, you do NOT want to spend a lot of money on it. Forget Nikon - buy a Canon!"
4,Solid Camera,"I'm a pro and can't find much to whine about. Nikon makes solid cameras and this is another...These cameras do have a tendency to purposely underexpose, in order to correct for any metering errors, this you can allow for by changing your iso or using the +/- exposure control. Read the manuals on these cameras very carefully, they can be very helpful. Buy 1 and start shooting."
2,"too expensive, memory card not included","better to buy a point and shoot, photo quality is just as good with Cannon A540, even when enlarging prints up to 36X24inches."
1,poor manufacutring quality,"At the beginning, I did take some good portraites with this camera. But after 13 month and 800 shots, the following problems emerge:1.the on/off switch doesn't work.2.the camera can't read CF card.3.meter overexpose.4.loose focusing.Cost to fix them? $250.00If you are professional or serious amateur photographer,Don't buy this camera just because it's cheap."
2,Not a Professional Camera,"This camera, as other D series cameras, has a serious limitation. It cannot be used on a bellows, a microscope or a T mount lens for automatic exposure. You have to set exposure manually by trial and error. If you only want to take conventional images with the lens systems that only Nikon will supply you there isn't a problem, but IF you expect exposure metering in the camera body, DO NOT BUY this camera."
1,The camara is not working,Im not from USA. My brother bought me the camara in a trip three months ago and it is not working!! It has serious conection problems in the body that I cant fix in my country. I lost 1000 US$
3,"Not great, not bad","Best feature - speed. From switching on to taking a shot is almost instant, compared to other DSLRs that take a few seconds to boot before being ready to shoot (eg. Canon EOS). So you don't miss candid moments. For journalists, that's fabulous.Worst feature - color balance. I've tried so many setting alternatives and this camera consistently yields slightly under-saturated, cold (ie. slightly blueish) pictures. Same experienced by reviewers on dpreview.com. It's fixable by most photo editing software like Picasa or Photoshop, but is annoying.Overall, better than most of its peers but I expected a more finished, tuned package."
1,FAA TEST HAS CHANGED. NO STUDY BOOKS AVAILABLE,THE FAA HAS COME OUT WITH A NEW VERSION OF THE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER'S TEST. CURRENTLY THERE IS NO STUDY GUIDE BOOK AVAILABLE. THESE BOOKS ARE STUDY GUIDES FOR THE OLD TEST. THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY NO USE FOR THE NEW TEST.
1,garbage,"test is different than this book save your money, barrons has done it again more inforior study aids?"
1,Terrible Quality,"Received this model 66 Oldsmobile Toronado today. The packaging and box were in good shape. However, the actual car is very poorly built. The paint is uneven and the doors fall off when I try to open them. Guess that this company has no quality control; total mockery of this iconic car. The bottom of this car is almost like a cheap toy; probably could have gotten better quality and detail from a match box car. I would not buy anoother model car from this company."
4,Oh dear Mr Foley,"I've seen this documentary on TV. I've seen much better ...I write as a Catholic Irisman living in London. I have to say how sad I thought Patrick Foley's review of it was...chilldish springs to mind, but written so soon after September 11, perhaps also astonishing that an American would support terrorism in whatever form it appears (Pat, don't you you remember ""the war against terrorism"" and the growing evidence of the IRA's links with Columbian drug dealers (and the effects of drugs on US society? - or perhaps it was convenient to overlook it!) I thought that most Americans, be they Irish-Americans or otherwise would have consigned the IRA to the trash-can of history. I'm obviuosly wrong...and that truely saddens me. But this is perhaps too contentious...I don't think it will be 'printed' by Amazon"
3,HBSE: A Social Systems Approach,I found this book very confusing...I had to actually think about what I was reading and reread it multiple times just to organize it and understand it. I read another similar book and it was much easier to understand.
4,Quick delivery and book was in good condition.,I ordered this book at the last minute and I got it a full week before class started.
1,not even worth a star!,"For all the reviews here with 5 stars, check the other reviews written, and you'll find that all of those books are either written by Michael B. Davie or published by so-called Manor publishing company. Now it's an easy guess who wrote all the favorable, but deceiving reviews. This book is the first ever I really wanted to return. It's garbage. Do not waste your money!"
4,Good Enough,"This is a great collector item for HQ fans, however the storyline as a whole is nothing spectacular. Definitely not worth the $80 unless you are a die hard fan."
5,"Beautiful condition, as described. Great product","Great product, beautiful cover, fun story to get you started on the mindset of the wonderful Harley Quinn. Worth it for an avid collector who is willing to spend a bit of money to enjoy a beautiful cover and a decent back story."
2,48 pages.....48.,"Just going to say that this is not a graphic novel, it is not some lengthy collection, it is really a 48 page comic with a high gloss cover. Not at all worth the prices that are quoted on here."
2,I like Batman,The story is halfway decent. The art is decent. The dialogue is horrible. The best part of this book is the cover art.
2,Mistake,"Bringing Harley Quinn into the ""real world"" was a mistake.Harley is a creature of the 2D world of teevee animation and the DC ""Adventures"" (animation-style) titles.Her antics and gadgets just don't work in a 3D world.Bring back ""Gotham Adventures"" and let Harley square off against Batgirl."
2,Fingerpaints or stainmakers?,"The book is adorable, but the fingerpaints were a disaster. All of the pages she drew on are greasy still after 4 days. They never dry, and they all look brown to grey. Kids can easily scoop out the cream fingerpaints and it ends up everywhere. You cant get it out of the carpet and curtains. She got some in her hair and those strands still look oily despite me using 2 different shampoos on her hair. Even as adorable the drawings are, this product is not recommended for kids under 5."
4,Good Toy - Way Overpriced,"Crayola Color Wonder Winnie the Pooh Coloring Book and FingerpaintsI purchased this item for my granddaughter from her wish list. I was sorely disappointed to find this same item at a local craft store for $8.95 (the regular price, not sale priced). I paid $20.60 for this item through Amazon.com. The next time, I'll check her wish list and purchase elsewhere."
3,Update needed!,"I agree with the majority of reviewers that this is an excellent book, making some very difficult concepts understandable to the layman. The book was published in 1992, and I bought the October 2007 edition. It is a pity that so much data in the book are outdated: Dark matter is hardly mentioned, and there is no reference to dark energy; the age of the universe is given as 'about 15 billion years', and I quote from page 174: 'The expansion rate (of the universe) is inexorably slowing.' Unfortunately, outdated concepts like these undermine the credibility of the book on the whole. I hope the authors review the book soon."
1,Rip Off,Why can't Season 3 be on one disk? Why do we have to purchase two different DVDs to watch one complete season?
1,Done with this series,"No, not a review of the show so don't bother carping. I was all set to buy season 3 until I found that they are attempting to rack up more money by splitting the season into two sets. I have a strong response to that, done with this series."
3,their are no good episodes,"The first season I loved it looks like a really interesting series, but the third season volume One and Two the writers need to be more creative."
3,"Not bad reading, average compared to other Christian fiction","I guess I have been spoiled by the Left Behind Series on this subject. I would have appreciated it more had I read it before I did the others. I wouldn't not recommend it, but I didn't go crazy for it."
2,Should have returned,Clark's are usually comfortable but the leather on these are too stiff. The size also runs a little small and they are not a true brown but more mahogany.
4,Real Good Mid-Tmpo Jam,this was a really good Mid-tempo Jam from Bobby Brown back in 1992.this was probably my favorite slow cut off that Album.
1,Awful,This book was almost 80$ it was small and flimsy and the information was not useful at all. The models offered in the book were redundant and not useful in a crisis situation. I would not reccomend this book. I returned it.
4,Handguide for the work warzone!,A perfect companion to the crazy work environment! Made me laugh out loud and scream in agreement at its description of coworkers. A must read if you want to kick someone at work!
4,WHAT I LEARNED,THIS IS A VERY INFORMATIVE BOOK WITH ESAY TO UNDERSTAND CONCEPTS FOR JUST ABOUT EVERYBODY. IT WILL TEACH WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW TO GO ON TO THE NEXT LEVEL IN YOUR MATH STUDIES
3,worked great until the cat figured it out,These pill pockets worked great with my for cat for a week or two. He happily ate his pill twice a day. But then he seemed to catch on and now he won't touch them. Probably works best for short term medication.
1,bought from Dig It,"bought from Dig It Pet Products: the best by date had been rubbed off, so no way to tell if it is fresh. older packaging with the word 'feline' under the word 'pockets' rather than above the word 'greenies'. opened the package today(1/7/12). they were all stale."
5,pill pockets,"I've never enjoyed giving my cat a pill, but Greenies Pill Pockets make it a breeze. I highly recommend them!"
3,Thank God!!! But....,"We have several cats and pilling multiple cats can be a bear. Along comes these wonderful things. While I thought none of the cats would fall for it, several have and actually see their meds as treats now. It doesn't work for everyone, but most of them like the pill pockets.Sadly, the recipe has changed. The bag with the 'all natural' on the label has a different recipe - and doesn't actually look more natural than the old recipe. The cat's won't touch their meds in the 'all natural' chicken ones. One will take them in the salmon flavored pill pockets, but we bought a bunch of these not knowing we were getting the 'new' recipe.To off set this surprise, we returned them and instead went to the dog chicken greenies and just but them up to fit the cat pills. Works like a charm."
2,My cat's too smart,"Pill pockets worked twice with my cat. On the third night my cat bit into a piece of an antibiotic and wouldn't touch them after that. I tried cutting the pill into smaller pieces. I tried smashing one of his regular treats into the pill pocket. I tried the chicken flavor of pill pocket. No go. I'm having much better luck with a ""pill gun."" It looks something like a hypodermic. I can get the pill to the back of his throat so he has to swallow it. I usually get it on the first try. If your cat licks his nose, that's a sign that he's swallowed the pill. My vet taught me that."
3,Okay for some cats,"The concept behind the product is wonderful, so I tried it with my cat. He's normally a loving, docile kitty but turns into Cat-Kong when we try to administer medication. It worked the first time, even though he had difficulty chewing it up because of the pocket's soft consistency. The second time we met with less success. It ended up slipping out of his mouth, and I had to offer it to him several times before he ate it. Thinking it was too soft for him to grasp with his teeth, I left one out on the counter to let it harden up a bit. The slightly hardened pocket worked the first time but failed to work after that. I think this product meets with more success with cats who enjoy wet cat food. My cat eats only dry food, so he lost interest in it quickly when he couldn't grasp it with his teeth. You may want to keep this in mind if your cat has only enjoyed the dry food. Even though it didn't work for my cat, it might be worth a try!"
5,For Dogs too!,"Each of my geriatric dogs take two very small pills once a day. These are barely big enough, but I can mold the treat around the pill as easily as playdough. They are very soft and the dogs eat them with no fuss. I do make sure that none of the pill is exposed, so they don't taste it. They are much less fattening than cheese or peanut butter."
3,doesn't work for all cats,"This is a great idea for giving pills to cats. I am sure that this works wonderfully with cats who love dry treats. My own cat doesn't like dry treats like temptations etc. I think its the smell because she eats her regular dry food but not the dry treat. Go figure. So it didn't work with my cat. Instead I crush her pills(please check with your vet first before doing this) and mix them with wet food. I tried giving these pill pockets as treats to my cat, but she still won't eat them."
2,Wish it had worked,"Our 12 year old Siamese has always been finicky about any type of cat treats. We tried them first without a pill. She instantly turned up her nose, wouldn't even give them a second thought. Kept offering them for a week and she never changed her mind. It's very disappointing. But our 10 month old tiger cat loved them!"
5,My cat never knew,"My cat is very finicky. He eats only what he wants to eat and nothing else. He has, on occasion, practicably starved himself because he didn't like the brand or flavor of food that I bought. A short time ago he broke his foot, and while he is all better now, the doctors recommended an herbal supplement on days where his arthritis has really bothered him. Giving him this pill, however, has turned out to be more traumatic experience, if not making the pain even worse then before I gave it to him. Popping it into the Pill Pockets makes for a much better solution. He thinks he's getting a treat, and although the first few times he was unwary, he has grown to love the treats and never noticing a pill inside. I would recommend this to all finicky cats everywhere."
2,For Capsules,"Not a good idea for capsule meds guys. You basically have to get really creative with it if you even want it to halfway work. I end up having use 2-3 of these pill pockets flatten and sort of ""meat-ball"" the medication from the capsule in the treat. My cat smells said treat/meds and doesn't eat it. Thus I end up having to force feed him the treat/meds anyway. I will say one thing good about it is the treat's kind of gummy so when I put it in his mouth the meds/treat instantly sticks all over this mouth and he is forced to swallow it. With that being said; moral of the story is it might just be cheaper/easier to use a syringe and shoot meds/bit of water down your cat's throat. Just. Won't be buying this again. I will probably just feed the rest to my dog (she really seems to love the taste)."
5,Peaceful pill administration for cats,"As our cat has gotten older, she started to exhibit signs of hyperthyroidism. The vet prescribed medication which had to be administered twice a day. Poor Nissa did not like taking pills. We had to wrap her in a towel, pry open her mouth, and put the pill down her throat. It was an ugly scene twice a day. Until we found Greeenies pill pockets! Now Nissa begs for her pill. She actually dances while we get it ready and gently takes the pill in the pocket from our hand as if it is a treat. Well, it certainly is more pleasant around our house as a result of Greenies. Highly recommend this product to restore peace in the house, and dignity to the cat."
1,My cat laughed at me,"My cat isn't a picky eater, but she had no interest in eating Pill Pockets. I was hopeful about these things, but my cat didn't even recognize that they were supposed to be eaten. Rolled it around, poked at it, sniffed it, and moved on. I can't imagine they are very fragrant or flavorful to get that kind of reaction since she eats everything else she sees. Glad to see others had success, but we weren't impressed."
2,Not the same as picture,"This product is no longer the same as the picture. The original product states on the front of the package"" With Real Chicken"" (as does the picture), while the package I received says ""Chicken Flavor"". My cat will no longer eat it, so I'm canceling my subscription for this product. I note that the ingredients in the original start with: Chicken, glycerin, wheat flour, natural flavors....; the new version's ingredients begin with: Rehydrated chicken, glycerin, wheat flour, wheat gluten...... I don't know why the product was changed unless it is a money-saving issue. However, if my cat won't eat it, the product is worthless to me. I'll keep trying with the packages of the ""new"" product that I have already received from Amazon (a box of six, plus my subscription of one packet), but the picture is of the older (and, as far as my cat is concerned, better), or at least a different, product than I ordered and received."
1,My cats HATE these things,"One of my cats developed a resistant infection in her paw that required pills for 2 weeks. Not only would she not eat the pill pockets, she backed away from them like they were poison. I wondered if it was the smell of the medication that she was sensing, so I tried giving my other cats a plain one of these to see their reaction. They all backed away from them.I did wind up making use of them, however, because the medication called for 3/4 of a pill. I stuffed the 3 pieces of the pill into the pill pocket, and then ""papoosed"" the cat in the bedspread and gave her the medication, followed by treats that she likes. That was really more trauma than either of us was happy with, but at least the pill pocket covered up the sharp edges of the pill pieces. (And her paw did heal!)"
3,No luck so far,Cat loved the Pill Pocket but still eats around the pill. Will keep trying; have seen the dog version work miracles getting fussy eaters to swallow meds.
5,Easiest way to give a pill to a cat,"As all you cat lovers know, it can be very difficult to give a cat a pill. The Greenies Pill Pockets are the answer. My cat looks forward to getting his ""greenie"" treat everyday."
3,GREAT IDEA ..BUT,What a great idea. I was convinced this was the answer to my cat/pill problems. So with great anticipation..I gave this to my cat. She sniffed at it and gave me a dirty look and walked away. Didnt work with my cat. Shes on to me. Will try something else. But I really like the idea of this product and it may work for other cats. So I gave it three stars for that reason.
3,"Works well, as long as your cat likes it.","These pockets worked well for our one cat's daily thyroid pill, then she decided to turn up her nose at them and the Greenies salmon flavor pockets. At least the other cats will still eat the pockets as treats."
3,"Works well, as long as your cat likes it.","These pockets worked well for our one cat's daily thyroid pill, then she decided to turn up her nose at them and the Greenies chicken flavor pockets. At least the other cats will still eat the pockets as treats."
3,Sometimes works,"If you have a cat who is prone to gobbling treats whole, these will likely work. My cat, however, chews treats, so she breaks the pocket open and then tastes the pill and spits it all out. It would likely work best with small pills and then you could use part of the pocket and maybe the cat would swallow it without chewing. You need to be extremely careful if the pill is bitter; if you handle the pill and get residue on your hand and then use those fingers to pinch the pocket shut, it will get residue on the outside, which makes the cat less likely to take it. It might help to just feed a few as treats without pills in the beginning to get them used to the idea that they are treats?"
1,Only works if your cat is not a chewer...,"I tried the chicken flavor, hoping I could disguise the nasty flavor of pills and/or vitamin supplements. Unfortunately, my 17-year-old cat doesn't just swallow it, he chews and reveals any stuff inside. Of course, he now refuses to eat them, even empty. They're simply too large for my cat (who is no tiny thing - he has weighed between ten and 13 pounds) to swallow easily. I'm switching to gelcaps instead."
5,AWESOME!,"What a super answer to a troubling task! I've had to give meds to my cats in the past, and it is SUCH a challenge. When the vet recommended these, I had serious doubts. However, they are PERFECT and by far the BEST invention EVER! I've also had a challenge of getting my elderly cat to eat more food, so when I mix these in with his food, he devours it! Amazon has the best price, by far ... but they work so well, I'd pay anything to get them!"
5,A little miffed...,"...that we didn't know about this product about 2 years ago. It took both of us, one to hold and pry open our sweet cat's mouth and another to deposit pill(s) and squirt in the water, twice a day. We had both gotten bitten before, but the most recent bite on my left thumb was pretty serious and got infected. Fun! Anyway, a client told us about Pill Pockets and price be d**ned, I'd pay 4 times as much just to not get bitten again. These things are heaven sent. Thanks, Pill Pockets! :)"
5,"Very picky cat LOVES them! They work, we are relieved!!!","The idea of forcing 48 pills down my cat was daunting. We tried food, chicken, cheese, etc. The cat would either stick his nose up at it, or just spit out the pill. With these things, 1 second and he just ate the whole thing. That was it!!! I am amazed.. This is a 12lb cat that will only eat 1/5th of a can of fancy feast in the morning and at night. Any more he just leaves it. He is very picky, but loves these."
5,Works great!,These pockets work so well with my cat. He takes his meds almost everytime. They are awesome.
3,Didn't work that great for us.,"The Pill Pockets seemed like a good idea, and maybe they are, but they only fooled my cat, Bonnie, for the first three or four times. After that she just ate some of the treat and left the pill, or avoided it altogether. She was never a lover of treats anyway, so maybe they'll work better on a cat who is."
