5,I have had one for 12 years. Highly recommended.,"I have used a watch like this almost every day for the last 12 years since I bought it in 1999. All it takes is a battery every 2 to 3 years and a strap every 2 or so depending how much you wet it.I am extremely happy with it. I purchased the full stainless steel version of the same dial size a couple of years later and I am very happy with it too, although I don't use it as often.This model is very lightweight and very low profile (but not ultra-thin). If you have a medium sized wrist, or if you don't like very heavy watches, this is for you.I highly recommend this watch for its durability and reliability. I personally like how it looks as well. Classic and easy to see the time in 12 and 24 hour standard."
2,Battery died in less then a year after purchase,Not happy with the fact watch battery ran out in less then one year. Next to impossible removing the snap on back to replace battery. Was told that watch needed to be mailed in for battery change. Good Grief what a hassle. next time I'll check the ease of battery replacement clause when spending so much money on a watch.
3,Handle design adds to length,"This is a great griddle. However, it's supposed to be 13x20, but with the handles sticking out, it's more like 13x24. If you have an open range, it's not a problem, but if your range has a back, the one of the handles will prevent correct placement on the burners. Just something to be aware of. Otherwise, it's a fantastic griddle."
2,"It's a ""dribbler""....","I liked the mug's look, feel, & size. Then I took a drink of java from this mug... I never could get a lip lock on this mug. The rim is very thin & very wide. It would always spill a couple of drops on my shirt. Nissan mugs have what I call a ""lip ledge"" that prevents the ""dribble"" effect to which the Bodum is prone. Nissan mugs also have a much smaller diameter rim which also makes drinking from them less hazardous to my white shirts."
1,Drinking Problem?,"I purchased two Bodum travel mugs. One of the lids leaks from the bottom. No visible difference between the two, however the lid leaks when used on either of the mugs. Be sure to dress in the color of your beverage!"
2,Dribble Mug,"I bought this mug based on a Consumer magazine's high rating concerning how long it keeps coffee warm. It does indeed keepit warm, but you end up with hot coffee all over your shirt. The design looks nice, but its fine rim with single narrow o-ring is almost impossible to seat properly to avoid leaking. I'm going to get a replacement from Bodum, but it looks more like a design flaw than a defective unit."
1,Dangerous and Infuriating,I bought three and all of them leak while drinking from them. They ruin your clothing and pose a scalding risk.
1,Awful,It's completely useless... The lid does not fit on the mug and so it dribbles all over the place. I really should have heeded the warning of a previous reviewer!! How do I return this item!!?
4,not bad for keeping warm,"Not bad for keeping warm. it kept my tea warm for 3 hours but i wish that it was completely transportable. I thought that the cover will close completely as a ""travel"" mug. meaning if it tilts, nothing will leak out.JLH"
1,Not happy,There is no closure capabilities on the top of the mug. I was not at all happy with this product.
2,No air hole makes drinking impossible,"I have not found leaking problems, but I was very disappointed to find that there was no air hole in the top of the cup, making drinking nearly impossible. I solved this by drilling a small hole in the top myself, but we shouldn't have to do this.I find that it is important to fully screw on the lid and check the seal. It can be tricky.The best part: keeps the beverage hot. But no return air hole? Ridiculous."
2,Bodum Stainless Steel Vacuum Travel Mug,"I liked the overall look and feel of the mugs, but both of the two mugs I purchased leak from where the top screws into the mug. I contacted Bodum and they had me send the mugs back for replacements. As of this review, I have not gotten the replacement mugs, so I cannot say if the originals had defective seals or if the problem is endemic to the product."
4,One of the poppier exports from the Canterbury scene,"Canterbury provided the home for artists such as Caravan, Robert Wyatt, Soft Machine, Gong and Kevin Ayers. While the others played jazzier music, Caravan preferred eccentric, hard-to-categorise rock -- a bit like Camel.This is one of their best albums, and has the merit of still being available on CD. (It saw the return of Dave Sinclair, whod' previously left Caravan to join Matching Mole on keyboards.) There is even some sophisticated production on tracks like 'Cthlu Thlu'."
5,"The bonus cut of CHEROKEE alone, is worth the purchase of this CD","I've had this album on vinyl for many many years, but you MUST get the Ruday Van Gelder edition with the two bounus cuts, ""The Way You Look Tonight"" and ""Cherokee"". Griffin is such an unsung hero here in the US. Thank GOD Europe and Asia recognize his greatness. Griffin, like Charlie Rouse are two of the best tenor players that ever lived. In my honest opinion, Rouse was the best tenor player for Thelonious Monk, but Griffin has that SPEED along with creativity but never lets you forget the melody while he is flying through his solo's. So many other ""great"" tenor players, play solos that have nothing to do with the song. If you listen to Griffin's solo's alone, you know which songs they come from.I hate when a player takes a solo that has nothing to do with the song they are playing on. Griffin is GREAT. This album is GREAAT. The bonus cuts, especially the great Ray Noble song ""CHEROKEE"" make this reissue a real gem."
5,A Classic Recording From a Now Unknown Legend (At Least Here in America),"While in my late 20-years, I do collect & buy jazz reissue. I'd never heard of this man until I purchase this CD (then I remember that he played with Art Blakey's Jazz Messagers in the late 1950s (the tenor saxophonist on the 1957 jazz Messagers with Monk recording).This is classic jazz at its finest with 9 songs of originals & standards (the last 2 were not in the 1956 LP release & won't see the light of day until the CD era). Griffin can really play the tenor horn, but because he made an exdous from the US in the early 1960s, he's not as well known here as he should be.Besides the disc, you get a booklet with the original liner notes, a new eassy from Bob Blumenthal, among with rare photos."
5,A great series,"Combat was a staple as I was growing up. The stories were realistic and gritting, the acting excellent. Viewers were able to feel empathy for the squad members and looked upon them as role models. Its wonderful that this ""best of"" series of videos has been released as the cost of the complete set is mostly prohibitive."
2,An incomplete guide,"When an RPG promises over 50 hours of gameplay and the guide has 128 pages then something is obviously missing. The weapon guides included aren't bad, but this guide does lack the picture walkthroughs of how to create each town from it's Georama pieces. It is not the kind of quality that is normally expected from a Prima strategy guide."
1,STUPID Pricing Tactics,"I just want to know why some idiot would charge $40 for a strategy guide of Dark Cloud when I can get it for $9 at the store! Are these people brain dead or what? You are supposed to sell for CHEAPER, not more you morons. I guess these people will never make it in business!!!"
3,Rediculous,"Why would anyone pay $29.00 for a strat guide when you can go to the store and get one for only $15.00. It is an awesome book, but come-on people!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Kiss- Off Letters to Men,"First let me say, I received this book as a gift from a friend at the most perfect time- right as a 4 year long relationship was ending. After reading it I felt a bit more empowered to survive the dating rituals with the male species. With a combination of the various witty retorts I am now armed for a come back. The book definately gave me an evening of laughter in which I could forget my short falls and be glad I was not in some of the humorous situations listed in the book.Definately buying more copies to pass along to friends!"
3,The blue dye is persistent!,"When I first changed from orange to blue, it was quite reassuring to see the blue color appear in my bleed stream. No more guesswork, I know when each line is fresh. But changing from blue to orange is not nearly as clear cut! In fact, I flushed a whole extra quart of ""orange"" fluid through the system, and the bleed stream was still visibly blue. Getting paler, but no obvious sudden change like the first time. I suppose something as viscous as brake fluid clings to all of the internal surfaces, and the dye clings with it. The ""orange"" fluid is probably just natural color, with no comparable dye - maybe they need to add some real orange dye!If you're going to keep flushing until all the blue is gone, be sure to buy a few extra quarts!Oh, yes, the fluid itself is great stuff. I've gone back to the natural color."
4,Great product...great for detoxifying the body and for fibro!,I use this product all the time for detoxification with heavy metals and for arthritic type pains. I would have given it a five but it took a while to get it in the mail!
5,An uplifting collection of tunes and songs w/ a Celtic tone.,"Titanic: Shop of Dreams is a delightful collection of tunes and songs with a Celtic lilt. A collection of tunes from the 1997 movie and songs written for the collection, it is well performed and extremely enjoyable. Enjoyment does not rely upon a love of the great ship but does require a taste for Celtic music. The music will certainly improve your mood as it is very uplifting."
5,Perfect!,"My birthday is on Sept so I wanted to have an engagement ring that had my birthstone with two diamonds on each side. It took me a long time to find it, however this was the only one that I found with the set up that I wanted, and it was such a plus to have the 5 smaller diamonds on each side. It is a gorgeous ring! A lot of people notice it and it's difference of style as an engagement ring makes it that much more beautiful! The beauty of the sapphire and the brilliance of each diamond makes it that much more special. The stones are the perfect size and the settings are well put together. Very happy with it, couldn't have found a better ring for myself and made it easy for my husband to be to buy me a ring. Thank you FineJewelers!"
3,....ok as an extra screwdriver .,Has 2 cartridges. The cartridege (not in the barrel) can be easily misplaced. Could be a little tricky for some. Some bits fell through??For the price I paid I can't complain. I keep it as a general driver on the second floor. I can't keep running downstairs. :)Clever design.
2,"good idea, but tool won't last","Pretty cheaply made, but a good idea. This tool is OK for homeowners, but I would like to see this idea in a pro grade tool."
2,Doesn't last,"This battery works, but doesn't last long at all. In a typical two-hour performance, both batteries will have run out before the show's over."
4,doo wop meets funk,"you like classic rock ala elvis, jerry lee lewis and bill haley thias is right up your alley but serious p funk fans like myself will be thrilled to know that george clinton from parliament-funkadelic fame sings on here sinc e george loves doo wop he sings whole lotta shakin in concert to this day."
4,Inexpensive charger works great,"It's used extensively for my iPod nano at work. Don't be turned off by the plastic connector, as the metal tabs lock it correctly.One note though, the charger doesn't work for a co-worker's iPod 40Gb generation 3. He has battery problems anyway, but the regular Apple chargers work for him."
2,Wasn't What I Expected !!! Doesn't work for G5 Video,"The charger did not work for the G5 Video as described. I planned to return it, but normally the shipping charges aren't refunded which means that I would lose money returning the charger. Luckily, my mom bought a Nano for my daughter this Christmas and the charger works for that."
4,It Works,"I was a little nervous buying this item, but so far the charger has worked for my 80GB black Video iPod. When I first plugged it in, the iPod started charging, but also started making a high-pitched quiet buzzing sound. After a few moments however, it went away.Also the prongs of the charger are sometimes difficult to put in to the iPod, and might get caught. Just be careful with it so you don't break it.Can't beat 1 cent, but I hope that this product works much longer than the price would suggest. So far so good."
1,Not Good,"It was worked for 4 days only!!!!!!Its very bad Item.Do not buy it..I dont know what the problem is but its no more working.Thanks,Pratap"
1,You get what you pay for - essentially nothing,"I have not been able to get this to charge my iPod 80g - tried multiple outlets, while playing/not playing/turned off. Nada. The icon indicates that the iPod thinks it's being charged, but it never actually did.Note that you pay $0.01 + $3.99 in shipping - so if defective you can only get the $0.01 back."
5,Great techno-pop with a definite military flavor,This is mostly british military cadences made into techno-pop music. It sounds kind of wierd on paper but the music really rocks.
5,Never Heard a Cadence Quite Like This,"Dance music with attitude. Kickin' melodies, excellent mix, vocals are Right-On. You gotta love the way they put this one together."
4,It's something new,"Hey, what can I say. If you're in the military you should get that cd. Music and beat is really kickin'. Great music if you want to go crazy on the dance floor."
5,Captain Jack is the power of the techno music.,"u r bomb and there is no doubt about it. and i am sure that u will keep going like that. and the lady who sings, is SO HOT and i just love her. Romeo D."
4,"Good, motivational book for kids, nice autobiography.","I originally bought the book to read myself, thinking their might be some practical advice in it for me. There was some of that, but only for those willing to do the exercises at the end of every chapter, (I'm amazed that so many people find that to be a deal-breaker). I basically mowed through this book in a day of casual reading.However, I've given it to my 10 year old son, and he seems to be a real fan. I think it's important for our kids to understand the importance of hard work, and this book helps illustrate the point.What it lacks is any sort of real business basis. The business that you find out most about in Farrah's childhood is the idea that got stolen from him.Overall, a good read, but would be better served in the biography section than in the business section. A should read for children."
5,Farrah is a genius....,"I have become a big Farrah Gray fan over the past year. This young man, who is about the same age as myself, has done more in the past 15 years, than a lot of Adults will do in their lifetime. It's only a matter of time before he's a household name like Donald Trump and Bill Gates. The book is very motivating and inspiring. I look forward to seeing much more from him in the future."
3,Reallionaire,"OK, I'm not tryin' to hate but it seems that if you are not a cute, very ambitious 8-year old who happens upon a mentor with the desire and the resources to help you out, then this book is just a heart-warming, rags-to-riches story, period. This is more of a ""how it happened to me"" than a ""how to"" book. I am pleased to see what can happen when intense, focused desire is aimed in a positive direction...and glad that he is reaching back to help others."
4,A film close to my heart,"I have been looking for a copy of this film for along time. Two of my cousins played extras in the movie. They got to attend the premire in Lexington and said it was the best thing they ever did. One of my cousins is now passed away, so it makes it even more of a family keepsake. I showed it to my dad on Sunday and he pointed out some of the senses that I missed my cousins in. I can't wait to sit down with my cousin and watch it again. The copy my dad had disappeared years ago and no one had been able to find the movie until I found it here. I'm glad you enjoyed the movie premire."
4,An Easy to use resource that really works,"I used this book many years ago when I was in high school during the summer. I was a very chunky 16 year old who lost 30 pounds in 3 months. I was proud of myself but this book made it easy. The recipes were good, you could eat what you wanted as long as it fell within the week's parameters (pasta one week, veggies another, etc.) The diet even works for those that take a birth control pill since it takes both natural and ""artificial"" cycles into account. I have been recommending this book to friends even though I haven't used it in years. When I find it again, I am intent on using it again. It was successful the first time, why wouldn't it be again?"
4,Not Yet,"Good information. Haven't had a chance to read all of it yet, but would like to dig deeper into it."
3,Looking forward to Book 2!,"The depth of the characters and their adventures kept me glued throughout the story.However, it's not really a science fiction story. That is, science does not drive the story--the characters do. And although I was a little surprised with how Book One ended, I still want to see what's next for these characters."
1,This book is a masterpiece of science fiction!,Anyone who is interested in excellent science fiction will enjoy this book.. It's well-written and fun to read. I look forward to Book 2 and hope it will appear soon!
3,"Nice hat, looks big on head",Its a great hat but it's one of those hats that look really big when its on your head.
5,I've never laughed so hard!! It was WONDERFUL!!!,The book is great!! I found myself laughing at one point and then crying the next. Just what I needed for a good pick me up!! Keep up the good work! I have never found a book of yours that I didn't like.
4,Danielle has done it again!,Another winner - thank you Danielle Steel! I buyyour books as soon as they come out in the bookstores.I especially liked this book because I could identifywith the character since we are in the same age range.Good story. It gives age 50+ single women hope
4,Perfect Diversion- Beachside read!,Danielle Steele writes another diversionary read with a fun happy ever after ending! I love this kind of book for a quick mental getaway. Read it in one sitting and think of it as the perfect style writing for women who just need a quick fun pick up. Entertaining and fun to read.
4,promptness,"I appreciate the promptness that I received the item, I will continue to buy from this person or company. Thank you"
1,Don't even bother - too short!,"An author can write a short book and it will be well received (i.e. The Gift) but this book falls very short of that lofty expectation. I felt while reading this Steel took her formula of putting wealthy people into everyday situations and just wrote a book to get it out to her publishers for some deadline. I read this book in an hour, and at the end of it, I found myself extremely disappointed. It's one thing if the book is good, and short, but this was not that. I would advise you not to waste your money on this book, but if you do want to read it, borrow it from your local library or a friend."
4,Found this book enjoyable,This book was interesting and fun to read. I enjoyed the characters and found them real the book made me laugh
4,Special Delivery,"Special Delivery is a good book, easy to read and will hold your attention, I would recommend this and all of the books she has written."
5,"Great, light, enjoyable, yet predictable read.","This is only my 3rd DS book & I truely enjoyed it. It was a easy read that I didn't want to put down. However predicible, I couldn't put it down. My only delema now is which one to read next."
5,Always good,It was a great read. I love Danielle Steel and this was no exception. She is always my go to author.
2,How can this author be so popular??,"I do not understand how this could be possible, but I found this book to be totally predictable and unbelievable at the same time. I just could not sympathize with any of the characters, especially the grown children. Maybe I would have liked the story better without the Hollywood glitz, but probably not much. I always knew what was going to happen next, and throughout the whole book I just wanted to shout at the charcters ""GET REAL!!"" So far I have read about 20 books from this author and the only ones I've liked have been Mixed Blessings, Accident, Daddy, and The Gift. I'm seriously considering giving up on Danielle Steel. It amazes me that she's sold as many books as she has; I'm not even going to get into the grammatical problems she has. For good romance, I think I'll just re-read all of my Lavryle Spencer books."
4,Very Good book,"It has been a while since I read this book, but I remember that I enjoyed reading this book."
4,Romance for Women in their 50's!!!,"It is amazing to read novels that actually reflect the lives of women and men in mid-life. We are still viable, lovable, and wise! Lovely story! Quick read."
3,A Speical Delivery,"I enjoyed this book, although not as much as I have enjoyed Miss Steels other books like Jewels, Once in a Lifetime, and Malice. It's about Amanda and Jack. Jack's son Paul is married to Amanda's daughter Jan. They never really hit it off until Amanda's husband died. Jan persuaded Amanda to go to a party at Jack's store Julie's. They had a great time together and fall in love. What do their kids say? What happens when over the hill Amanda gets pregnet? Read to find out."
3,"Easy to read, nice story, very predictable.","This book has a clean, nice story line. It is easy to read but very predictable."
1,I felt cheated by this book,"I have always loved Danielle Steel and have read most of her books so when I saw this one, of course, I bought it. Troughout the book I had the impression that she had written it in one afternoon. The story is as simple as one you would read in a magazine and totally predictable, so much in fact that as I kept reading what I expected happened, and I had to stop reading to get over my disappointment. This book IS NOT Danielle Steele and I felt betrayed because it felt like she just wrote a book because she needed to meet a deadline and the editors know that everybody reads Danielle Steele and did not take the time to realize that it might dissapoint her fans."
1,So bad it's good!,"Okay, so let's give Danielle a break, if we had to churn out books like she does, some of them would be bound to be pretty thin, too. But this one consists almost exclusively of exposition. ""They had a fabulous weekend."" ""Their sex was phenomenal."" ""His children were the light of his life."" Etc. It's more like a synopsis than a novel. I see Danielle dictating this outline for a novel and then cutting and pasting a few (very few) lines of dialogue into it and then sending it off and voila--it sells a million copies. I wonder if any of her fans even noticed the difference?"
2,Not one of her best,"I have been reading Danielle Steel's books for over 15 years now. Sometimes they do get a bit ""all the same"" with most of the characters being important, successful, beautiful people who live in ""stately homes"" and wear ""important jewels and furs"". Sometimes I think the characters are more about what they have then who they are. Despite this, I always enjoy her books - they are easy to read, romantic and make you forget about everyday life for a couple of hours while engrossed in the book. Personally I think her earlier books are more enjoyable and get more involved in the characters than some of the later books she has written.A book full of the ""beautiful people"". This one was predictable, kind of boring and I hated her children ... they were so immature and spiteful. I would definately recommend ""Thurston House"", ""Palomino"" or ""Rememberance"" over this one."
3,Certainly Far Fetched But Somewhat Enjoyable,"Not necesarilly the most serious piece of fiction on the market. But since when is fiction supposed to be serious?The emotions of loneliness are deeply explored in Danielle Steele's novel Special Delivery. And they are done quite well. But who would figure that a party would kindle a romance between the newly widowed Amanda and a long time bachelor, Jack? And oh what different personalities between Amanda and Jack. The main thing they have in common is the family connection from each of their former spouses to their children and children in law.Some soap opera like trials and tribulations occur between Jack and Amanda and their children that rival the stuff you might witness on One Life To Live and All My Children. You cannot take the novel so seriously. But somehow there are enough twists and turns to keep most audiences at least remotely intrigued. Its short length of 229 pages makes it an amusing light read instead of a long drawn out bore."
1,Not worth anyone's time,"Cardboard characters; weak, transparent plot. This is the second Steel book I have read - never again. Stupid problems solved within pages (with much hand wringing). At one point, Author has main character sitting up all night discussing their interests ... would have been nice for reader to learn what these people were interested in, so we could care more about them."
2,typical Danielle Steel,"I read Special Delivery in a few hours-only about 200 pages. It was a very light read. The characters are pretty much one-dimensional. The plot was also pretty predictable with everything working out just fine in the end. It's a nice book to pick up if you have some time to spare and want to read something that's not too taxing, but don't expect any earth-shattering revelations in this one"
4,Special Delivery,"After 26 years of marriage, Amanda Robbins become unexpectedly widowed. She stayed at home in a depressed state for a few years afraid to give up the memory of her late husband. One day, her daughter talked her into going to a Hollywood party and she finally gave in. Amanda had been a famous actress before and knew lots of people at the party. The party gave her a jumpstart on her lost social life plus she met a new man named Jack Watson, who was the father of her son-in-law. Jack was a boutique owner in Beverly Hills and was a swinging bachelor with a bad reputation. Amanda soon found him to be a charming gentleman. As the story progresses Amanda and Jack fall in love and then one day they have suprising news to give to their family..."
1,Awful Review Section,"I wasted about 4 weeks studying this book's review section. Then I took the practice exam in the back of the book and I couldn't even answer any of the first 25 questions. I don't know what they put in their review section but MAYBE you will find 1/4 of it on the exam. I finally went to my University's library and took out 2 general psych textbooks to study in the two weeks left I have until the exam. I'm really upset that I wasted so much time, if only I knew this 4 weeks ago! The ONLY good thing about this book is the practice exams, beacuse you will be able to get a feel for the test."
2,Study Guide?,"This book was a total dissapointment. It gave very brief descriptions of individuals and their contributions to psychology (1 sentence) making recall difficult because there was not much to remeber. The book covers a lot of content but not in-depth, which is not helpful as you need to understand concepts and theories for the GRE. The only thing I used this book for was some of the practice tests. If you want some practice writing the test I would recommend this book but for study purposes you should look elsewhere (Kaplan's Study Guide)."
2,Rather slow,"I found this to be a very slow moving movie with characters that were not very likable nor identifiable with. The main character player by Viggo was such a sad character of a person, a total weakling, if it was not for his propaganda purposes, one could not see his belonging to the SS. He tries to be good to his friend but can't, he can't say no, he can't say yes..just flowing along like a leaf in a weak current of water. Recommend? Not really."
2,The name contradicts the movie.,"WWII/Nazi based movies/shows almost always interest me and keep my attention (Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers, The Pianist to name a few) ""Good"", however, wasn't so 'good'. Don't get me wrong, Viggo is a great actor. It jumps around too much, and didn't explain enough for me, causing me to lose interest very fast. Everyone spoke too quietly, and it was kind of hard to understand them even with the volume up. The whole movie seemed to drag on a little too long, and didn't really pick up probably until he finally puts the Nazi uniform on, which is pretty close to the end. Just when I thought it was getting better and caught my interest, it cut off to an awful, confusing ending leaving me scratching my head asking ""what was that?!"" I wish I read reviews before buying it. I thought it would be good, since these types of movies usually are, but I wasn't satisfied. Unless your a die-hard Viggo fan, I wouldn't really recommend it."
3,Could be a 5 star if it had a good finish ending the story,"The VIDEO apply named ""Good"" which the lead character struggles for, and perhaps ends up with but keeps falling short because of his weak nature. This struggle drives the whole story. He is imprisoned by a dysfunctional wife and mother who to late develop some semblance of normality. The story line which drives this video is that this idealistic professor write a piece of fiction which Hitler and his crony's love and convince him to develop into a ""paper"" and movie to justify killing the mentally Ill and disabled German population. All this ends up creating a man who's weakness and desire for love and peace and/or quiet falls prey to the NAZI flattery and admiration of the ""elite"" members of the SS. He struggles to correct his ways and thinking but fails every time. I can't say if he really made a true change at the end because this story could have earned a ""5 star"" with 100 more feet of film."
4,A Reluctant Nazi,"This personal story does a fairly good job of showing how a decent and principled sort of guy could gradually join with sadistic monsters and even wear the dreaded black SS uniform. Some of the same circumstances might apply to a communist under Stalin. Someone wants to advance in his career, then just to save it, then to foolishly believe the abuse may end on it's own."
4,"Viggo is great in ""Good""",Another view of how Nazi Germany came to be. Average people just trying to survive what they don't fully understand.
5,Limited Release,"This film only played in a few selected theaters. While I was not expecting much because it was a limited release, I was pleasingly surprised that it turned out to be an interesting film. While it was not a hard-core film like Schindler's List, it once again causes us to reflect on the Holocaust. Bringing the feelings of the war from a different point of view, we see the horror of what is happening through the unbelieving eyes of an SS officer who never thought the war would go so far. This refreshing insight, which is rarely displayed, gives us a more in-depth feel of not only war, but of human will. It reminds us that if we don't take a stand or open our eyes that we'll have to suffer consequences. I'm pleased with any film that looks outside the box and the writer and director of this film expertly did so without offense. I will be on-the-look-out for more of their work."
5,Remarkable and wonderful!,"How can there be no other reviews of this great book? ""Shiloh"" itself is superb, ranking with ""In the Gloaming"" and ""The Lottery"" as one of the three all-time great short stories (in my opinion). A++++"
5,One of my favorite books,"Bobbie Ann Mason's characters are so real that you feel like you'd meet them when you're at the grocery store or Target buying laundry detergent or frozen waffles. Some of them, I think, are my relatives (or me). She manages to create people who are unique, yet shows us the parts of them that are just like us. I've read and reread this story collection so many times and never tire of it. I've bought every book she's written and am particularly fond of her short stories."
5,great for pets in a hot weather,"It is great for pets and you don't have to replace the water often, just make sure you add some every 2 or three days. I wish it would have a timer..."
2,Cat Water Fountain,I am somewhat disappointed because I wanted a product where the water came out like a drinking fountain. The water in this product flows down a ramp.
1,not what was pictured!,"when i ordered this product, it was listed as white and was a slightly different model. the product was that was delivered was simply not what was pictured or described. that having been said, the bigger problem was that the thing arrived with broken parts. suffice it to say, not a good purchasing experience!"
1,Pump quit working in less than 24 hours!!,I bought this yesterday at my local pet store. $45! And the #@%$! pump stopped working during the night. Taking it back today. My cat did like it and starting using shortly after setting it up but it is cheaply made for the price. Not sure which kind to buy now.
3,"Works, but disappointing over time","I've had this Petmate Fountain for probably three years, and really, the negatives far outweigh any positives. I find myself more and more fed up with how hard the unit is to clean. There are so many nooks and crannies that I simply can't reach with anything I have at home. I've also had more and more pump problems to the point that I think it might be dead now. Perhaps three years is good to get out of a pump, I'm not sure. At this point the pump seems completely seized up. Every trick that has worked before to get it working no longer does. With how hard the whole unit is to clean, I'm not sure I want to replace the pump and am looking to buy a hopefully easier to clean design."
1,Only if you really take the time to clean it,"Own a couple of these cat fountains and they aren't worth it. It is affordable and very quiet, but that is the only thing going for it. The resevoir, as has already been stated in previous reviews, is a horror to clean. It gets filled with scum frequently and therefore needs to be cleaned often. The filters are a waste too. I would give it a NO STARS if allowed. Unless you are going to really thoroughly clean it every 2 or 3 days your cat is going to be drinking disgusting water."
1,Pump is disposable,"This unit looks nice, and at first the pump was barely audible. Although my cat wouldn't go near it, I thought in time she would learn. Then the pump got loud enough that she was afraid to go near her food as well. There was enough water in the bowl but the pump struggled, and after a few minutes, failed to move the water at all. I'm not sure of the price of pumps, but I'm not about to buy a new one every 24 hours to keep this fountain running.Reading reviews of comparably priced fountains, it seems that quality is hit or miss -- mine missed. Take your chances and maybe you'll have better luck."
3,Too loud,"This fountain is ""ok"". It is louder than I was expecting based on other reviews. It's like listening to a refridgerator running ALL THE TIME. I bought the jumbo size but can't really tell if my cats drink from it more than just a regular bowl."
5,"Great price, good product","I had been thinking about getting this type of fountain for a while. Had to go for it with the great price.Cats love it (and dog too). I haven't found it to be messy, but I keep the flow on the lowest setting. Unit is quiet if the water level isn't too low. I think they drink more water too, since I fill the tank daily.It should be noted that my cats have always loved drinking out of a faucet, so that is why I feel they enjoy this.I would buy this product and recommend it too."
1,Doesn't work for long,"I purchased one of these fountains in December 2005, and loved it at first - I recommended it to a family member who also purchased one the following month. Despite regular cleanings and making sure that water level did not get too low so as to prevent damage, both fountains had stopped working by March 2006. I was very disappointed that they both broke within 3 months."
1,Cat loved it; too bad it broke after a week!,"I had high hopes for this fountain, but, alas, like other folks have mentioned, the pump failed. Unfortunately, my cat didn't even get 2 weeks enjoyment out of it. I guess I could go get a new pump, but I think I'll probably just return the whole thing. Kind of peeved that we didn't get more than a week's worth of use."
2,Just don't last,"I have gone through 3 of these, and none lasted more than a few months. I finally gave up and bought a completely different brand with much more success. Steer clear of the Petmate!"
4,Kitty loves it!,"We recently adopted an adult male cat from the local SPCA shelter. He was found abandoned, so there was no information on him. He has become a wonderful addition to our home, but he would only drink water out of a running faucet??? This is not convenient or practical. Looking for a solution, I happened to see the Petmate Fresh Flow Fountain. He loves it and is happy to drink from it--I think the movement of the water into the bowl makes it for him."
2,Petmate Fresh Flow not so fresh,"its takes forever to clean. To many parts and the saliva slime still sticks to it. The large back part seems easy to clean but there are tiny plastic partitions inside that get junk stuck in the corners, I have to use a cue tip to clean it and even that doesn't work. Too much work for this item."
3,Petmate Fresh Flow Fountain,We had used our Petmate Fountain for 7 yrs before the motor went out. We ordered a new one from Amazon and are as pleased with this one. Our pets love to drink from running water.
5,Helped a Sink Only Drinking Cat Kick the Habit,Have a cat that only wanted to drink out of the running fawcet. Tried several other moving water pet watering devices. This one was by far the quietest and only took two days for the cat to notice it and start drinking. Now he does not even glance at the sink he just drinks and drinks out of the Petmate.
1,"Not worth it, Leaks!!!!!","I've had one of these fountain for years and it always worked beautifully. Decided to order a second one this summer and discovered the changes for the worse. Seems the new pump is more powerful and NOT adjustable. This results in serious water leakage. I've tried 3 times to purchase and exchange these leaky fountains without luck. They all leaked so badly that my floor was soaked repeatedly and the reservoir was emptied in 2-3 days. Unless the manufacturer makes changes 1. an adjustable pump, 2. extending the interior wall above the pump area to prevent overflow, I won't purchase another petmate fountain. I don't recommend you purchase this either.Time to find a better fountain from a different manufacturer."
1,want to love it,"I bought this product a few months back because my cat was constantly jumping up on the sinks and in the tub to get water instead of drinking out of his bowl. It took him about a week to get the courage up to try it but once he did he never jumped up on the sink again. He loves it! Now here's the reason for the low low rating and that is the fact that the stupid thing leaks all the time. I can't even really figure out what makes it leak, there are no apparent cracks. When enough water leaks out then it makes this awful sucking noise which I have woken up to on more than one occasion. I can't even leave it on for my cat when I leave for the weekend because I am afraid the pump will fry. The final thing is that the water in the basin doesn't say any cleaner than a bowl. It accumulates food and hair and needs to be cleaned at least once a week. I certainly won't go back to a bowl but I'm now on the hunt for a new fountain."
4,"My cats l,ove it",My cats will only drink fresh water. This becomes a hassle when youa re constantly changing the water in their bowl. I bought the pet mate fresh flow fountain with the hope that it would eliminate the need to constantly chnge the water. My cats love it. They will drink fromthe stream of filtered water without problems. The only drawback is that the pump clogs easily with cat hair and flow is decreased over time and requires dismantling and cleaning.
2,Great for a while but then it falters,"I loved this item for a long time. It is quiet and not unattractive. But, I have had it for a year or so, and now it is not working. The pump seems to be broken, because when I add water to the resevoir it stops flowing and sometimes days later it will suddenly turn back on. It is also difficult to clean in certain parts that are hard to access for scrubbing, but good at trapping orange mold. I also bought one for my neighbor a while back and her cats refused to use it."
3,Pump defect,"Have 2 of these and gotten about 3 years use from the 1st fountain before the pump failed and about 2 years use from the 2nd fountain.Both had the same issue; the electric cord frayed where it enters the pump.During cleaning the pump wasn't removed by pulling the cord which could precipitate this happening. Always pulled the pump itself up from the fountain base.Possibly if the cord was reinforced at the insertion point this wouldn't happen?Recently wrote Jaebo about this flaw. If a response is received will update this post.Have ordered one replacement pump to date, however it doesn't have the flow valve.Cannot seem to find a pump similar to the original including on Jaebo's website."
2,My cat enjoyed this but read on...,"My cat really dug his kitty fountain but my overall experience with this thing was kind of bad. Yes it recycles the water a bit and keeps it fresher than say a stagnant water filled bowl but it seemed to collect lots of crud and hair that never makes it through the tiny hole to the filter. The reserve tank was useless...the water level never went down when the water was circulating so it was a pretty big waste of water. Also, the thing makes terrible noise when not completely full (but the reserve tank never worked) so you have to dump water in it all the time or else listen to this loud grinding sound. After, 7 or 8 months the pump conked out completely and so I went and bought a Drinkwell for my boy today. The Drinkwell is superior in every way and kitty is happier with it."
3,Not so great,"The fountain worked well for the first couple of months, but then it started leaking. I took it apart several times and still couldn't figure out where the water was leaking from. The motor is also somewhat noisy and that bothers my cat."
1,Extremely disappointed,This unit was very disappointing in that the pump is inadequate to keep the water flowing and requires constant attention. I would not recommend this to anyone.
2,not so quiet,"i want to give this a higher rating as it is reasonably priced and fulfills a niche that is necessary. my particular machine at least is not so ""ultra quiet"". i read the manual and tried their suggestions about how to make it less noisy. i think the noticeable noise is just part of the design. it is definitely noticeable when the living room gets quiet. i know they could have designed this to be truly ""ultra quiet"". too bad. i probably end up junking this machine when the annoyance of the machine grows to be too much. i bought it so cheap at $16.99, that it is not worth the hassle to package and ship it back."
2,First 4 days were great!,"My cats were fascinated by this water bowl even though i thought it looked like a baby toilet (maybe that's why they liked it??) They played in it more than drank from it for the first few days and made a mess! But, eventually they began to trust it and drank from it. By the 4th day, the cat hair they dropped (I have two cats) was constantly clogging the water intake at the bottom of the dish. This meant that not only was the water not circulating correctly, the water level would get very low even though the ""tank"" in back was full. It would make loud sucking noises that scared my cats and actually were loud enough to wake me up at night! So, this product probably works great for hairless cats, but for the rest of them...it's a lot of maintenance for a water dish."
3,cats like it better than me,"I thought this would be the perfect solution for my sink drinkers. They do like to drink out of this fountain. The best feature of this is the quiet motor, you can hardly hear it when more than a few feet away. the problem is that the motor starts to grind as soon as the water level goes down, which in our house is every day. So i find myself filling it all the time. You also have to have filters on hand. And it gets grimy quickly. I have several animals, so maybe if you have only one or two, it would not be as much of an issue. all in all, not a bad product, but could use a little improvement."
2,Why combined with non-fitting filters,Curious why amazon has chosen to combine the Large size fountain with filters that fit only the Medium and Jumbo size fountains.
2,not great,our findings:1) our kitties aren't interested: we have a fairly large herd of cats here and were surprised that none of them cared one way or another about drinking their water from this.2) doesn't circulate water that well: the fountain has to be filled to the brim for a small trickle to appear.3) gets dirty fast: there's a filter but it's probably for show.conclusion:waste of electricity.waste of $30.
3,NOT BAD,The cat likes it but still prefers the fish tank filter. Its a bit noisy but anything w/ a motor will be.
1,Lousy Design,This is an excellent idea but a lousy design. It's impossible to clean in all the nooks and crannies inside the reservoir and the crud that grows there is nasty. Usually I donate things I don't care for to someone else who might use them. But I wouldn't wish this nightmare on anyone who cares about their cat.
4,"Good Fountain,cats and dogs love it. A little difficult to clean","I have had this product for about 5 years with no issues. The cats and dogs love it. I had been filling it at least twice a day so I also purchased the Drinkwell. Which is also good, but not as well liked by the dogs. They prefer the Petmate.Most of the parts are dishwasher safe on the top rack and it does a great job of cleaning it. I usually clean both fountains by hand about every two weeks. The tight areas are a bit difficult to clean. I find that the Drinkwell is easier to clean. But the hassle of cleaning it is worth it to keep the cats urinary tract and kidneys in good shape.I have had no issues with the pump in all the years I have had the product. Which ever brand you choose it will be great for your cats!"
3,Pump malfunction,"We had one of these for about six years and finally it started to leak. I may have been at fault since we had to use ""lime away"" twice a year to get the scale out of it. I performed that maintenance for four years without a problem. Since the cat always loved this device, I thought I'd buy a new one. Well it worked great for a month then started to make noise after a few hours like it was out of water. Something wrong with the pump apparently, I haven't had the time to disect it. My resourceful wife put the pump from the old unit in and it's been fine ever since."
2,Not designed properly,"We had one of these for almost three years, and with two cats (one of whom sheds quite a bit), we had to clean it every few days. This unit comes with a filter, but the filter is pointless, because it comes after the pump in the order of flow. Meaning that any debris, cat hair, dust, etc get jammed in the pump long before they could ever make it to the filter. Once the filter gets clogged (in 2-3 days for us), the flow comes to almost a complete stop, and the cats stop drinking.Stick to the CatIt or Drinkwell products. The CatIt has the filter before the pump, not after, and has been working flawlessly since we bought it."
3,Makes a lot of noise,"If the water tank is not full all of the time then the filter makes a lot of whirring and sputtering noises. In addition, the water flow isn't strong enough to truly circulate the water and clean it so I have to stir it towards the filter to clear the particles. The cat does drink more water now though because she enjoys catching it right out of the spout. It's okay but not great."
3,Petmate Deluxe Flow Pet Fountain is good,My brother-in-law bought this for me for my birthday. It ws pretty easy to set up. It works as advertised. Now I just have to convince my cat to drink from it. But that's the cat's problem.
2,cheaply made,"This is the second pet fountain I have purchased, and my experience is that they were both very cheaply made. If the water is not at the very top, the pump makes noise from sucking in air. They could have designed it with the inlet lower in the bowl. The extra water container that is supposed to add more water when the level gets low does not work. It just stays full of water. I think next time I will just buy a garden fountain. The cats won't know the difference and it will be something we can all enjoy!"
2,Works for about a day..then worthless,"I've had this filter for about 6 months now and I am throwing it out. When you put in a fresh filter the unit will work as advertised for a day or two, at which point the filter becomes worthless and doesn't allow the water through. The pump then makes a gurgling noise and the flow of water reduces to about a trickle. Since no water can get through the filter, the water becomes very dirty and undrinkable. I've replaced the filter, followed all the instructions on the unit, and have had this same problem repeat itself over and over. Just use a bowl and fill it with water every day."
1,"nah, too noisy","We bought a Petmate after buying a Drinkwell because we wanted to see the differences in quality, and ease of cleaning. We ended up returning the unit for being considerably louder than the Drinkwell."
1,BAD-BAD PRODUCT--DIDN'T LAST LONG!,"HAD TO CLEAN IT TOOO OFTEN...ITWOULDN'T FLOW WELL, IF NOT CLEANEDEVERY COUPLE OF DAYS...ALSO...I BOUGHT NEWFILTERS AND REPLACED FILTERS OFTEN, TOO.THEN...IT JUST ""QUIT"" WORKING!! VERY ""POOR"" PRODUCT!!"
2,flooded kitchen,Have had this product for about a week the first 6 days worked great my cats loved it and on the 7th day i woke up to a flooded kitchen....not sure what happened but it looks like it was leaking out of the botton of the unit. Not sure if this is an easy fix or if the product is trash now... :(
3,Cleaning is a pain.....,"My two cats loved drinking from their fountain, which I received as a gift. The fact that their water got food debris and fur in it bothered me - and cleaning it was not a simple task. Filling became problematic because the cap broke and I was unable to replace it. One of my tabby's, Sullivan, started playing in it. He loves running water so it was with reluctance that I put it away. Cleaning both the floor and the fountain daily became a chore. There has to be a way to make a fountain that's easier to clean - but this is definitely not it and I would not recommend it to anyone."
1,Utter Waste of Money,"We have yet to meet a cat or dog who isn't afraid of this thing. The consensus among owners I've discussed this with is that the cheap Chinese-made pump is likely emitting audio frequencies (inaudible to humans) that offend the keen sense of hearing of animals.If you really want to believe the positive reviews, go ahead and get one, but, keep all the packaging and be prepared to return it within the allowable return window."
3,"Cats LOVE it, We HATE it!","Our cats really seem to love this watering system but we humans HATE it! It is definately NOT user-friendly! The pieces do not fit together smoothly. This is such a pain to clean! When cleaning time comes, we both hold off hoping the other will do it first. The plastic pieces are so difficult to reassemble. Hate it! However, the cats love the water flow so we'll stick with it until we find a better model. After that, we're done! GREAT idea! Bad design!!"
3,Cats Loved Everything But the Slime,"My cats loved this product. I found it difficult to take apart and clean which I had to do on a regular basis since the bowl would get slimy. I would change the filters (the expensive filters, I might add) twice a month and clean the pump once a month. I would use filtered water. Nothing worked and I had to finally quit using it. My cats were VERY disappointed."
4,Good product,"As other reviewers have mentioned, my only issue with this product is the noise it makes as it empties. When it gets to 10-15% capacity, it gets louder. I don't think that it's too loud, but it is definitely noticeable above ""background noise."""
4,happy cat,"It has taken our kitty 2 months to accept to use the fountain, but he has finally begun drnking from it, so be patient. He was still expecting to be able to drink from the water tap and has finally given up. The sound of the trickling water finished by seducing him. Good product."
4,Working fine so far,"I had no problem installing this, though one other reviewerhere did. It was considerably cheaper from Amazon than it wasat Pet Express. The only addition I would have liked would bean option to have the water fall down as from a faucet ratherthan flowing down a slope, since I had gotten the devicebecause my cat liked to drink from a dripping faucet. Ijury-rigged a plastic straw so that the stream of water couldfall from the straw into the bowl. My cat now does alwayslike to drink from the stream that comes out of the straw."
1,Lasted 6 weeks,"My pump failed in 6 weeks. The pump is a fifteen dollar replacement part, so no thanks. That's not a solution.To Amazon's credit, they said they would accept the return, but I am waiting forever to get a postage-paid label snail-mailed to me -- and who knows how long it will take for the credit. Amex has a 90-day product guarantee, so at least I know I'll be protected by my cc if Amazon doesn't come through."
4,works but needs maintanance,"cats love it but you do have to clean it and clear hair and debris from pump intake. mine also died but all you have to do us pull off the front of the pump and clean the inside, also pull out the impeller (its just held in place by magnets). started right up"
2,problems with the fountain,"My cat rarely drinks from it and prefers the dog's bowl or meows by the sink until I turn the faucet on for him. My cat also is a messy eater and frequently drops both wet and dry food into the fresh flow which gets clogged into the filter. In addition, the filter needs to be cleaned frequently as it can harbor worms! I went to clean the fresh flow as I regularly do to find scores of wriggling black worms coming out of the filter! Unbelievable. I'm ready to find a better filter that doesn't attract parasites like the fresh flow or just get rid of it all together."
4,Pet Mate Fresh Flow Fountain ( a must have for my cats),My cats love this fountain. They can't wait for the water to flow down. They lick it right as it flows into the bowl. This is the second one for me. Suggestion...take it apart about once a month to make sure the motor is free of any particles or cat fur. It saves on the motor.
1,DO NOT BUY PETMATE PRODUCTS..THEY DO NOT STAND BEHIND THEM,"This PetMate product lasted less than two months! I have had similar products, so I know I did not abuse or misuse the product. I contacted PetMate twice...they did not respond to either inquiry. They do not stand behind their products! I would have rated it 0 stars if I could have."
1,The quality has gone to the litter box - the newer model is junk.,"This is my fourth pet mate water fountain. And I do love how they keep the water circulating and the kitties drinking. But the first one I had lasted two years before the motor wore out and possibly part of the housing broke. Fair enough - it's not that big a price to pay for the cat's health. The second lasted about a year and 2 months, the third, one year. At this point I thought about jumping ship to the other brand, but decided to give this one last go. The current one makes a racket. Despite careful dismantling and cleaning, it is destined for the trash pile. After two months. I ordered this one on 3/28/10. And after the repeated taking apart for cleaning, there's no way that the plastic housing will endure much longer even if the motor wasn't faulty, it's far more brittle than the original model. Utter doodoo. Skip it and go with the alternative."
2,"Good idea, bad design","I was really excited about this product before I actually got it. Cats naturally prefer moving water (like drinking from the faucet) over still water (like their pristine water bowl you just filled). However, the design is seriously flawed. The water and filter chambers have little niches and indentations which are virtually impossible to clean without running the unit through the dishwasher (and who wants to do that daily?). A layer of slime builds up on the inside within a few days, reminiscent of algae in a pond (yum!) The filter compartment traps food and fur so it's not in the bowl, but all the remaining water gets pushed through the collected gunk, which means all the water tastes bad. Definitely not useful for leaving the cat by himself over the weekend, because he won't drink water that tastes bad, even if he is the one who got the food and fur in it."
1,No better than a water dish,"As the review title says, this product is literally no better than having a water dish. The reservoir is too small to last even one day in a multiple-cat household. Worse, it quickly stopped working properly, leaving the pump sucking air while the reservoir was still full. Even right out of the box, the fountain merely provided a trickle of water down the center slide, with no waterfall effect, which means the cats drink straight from the bowl, just as if you'd never spent extra for a motorized fountain in the first place.Stick with the DrinkWell. Or a water dish."
2,2nd and last Petmate Fresh Flow,"I was very pleased with my previous Petmate Deluxe Fresh Flow, but purchased a new one when a price on Amazon made it almost as economical to replace the whole unit vs. a worn out pump. The body has been redesigned - the pieces are shaped and fit together differently. I'm not sure whether this design contributes to the problem, which is that this second Petmate fountain is very loud, and regardless of whether the reservoir is full, the water level in the bowl is not maintained at a level to keep the pump from ""sputtering."" The previous fountain was virtually silent; this one can be heard from several rooms away. I have had the manufacturer replace the pump, with no improvement. We will not be purchasing another fountain from Petmate."
4,Very Pleased,"I was very pleased with the speed of arrival. The product is very handy and is almost identical to an old one I had before I moved a year ago. It is a little louder than the old one, but other than that, great."
3,Previous model better,"Petmate 24860 Deluxe Fresh Flow 50-Ounce-Capacity Pet Fountain, Medium, WhiteThe color of white over blue is great, but the new water pump is very noisy and without the filter guard it is more difficult to clean. Fortunately I was only buying a new FreshFlow for the looks. The previous one had worked beautifully, so I was able to pirate the motor and filter from the one that I was retiring. So together they have made a good combination."
2,Not big enough for three cats,"This would probably be good for one, very dainty cat, and an owner who's home all the time. However, the instructions say not to leave it on when you're not around - and indeed, the reservoir is so small that it runs out of water in 1 to 2 hours anyway. I have three cats, all of who love to splash in the water so crud gets into the dish and just stays there until I clean it out. My old inverted-jug waterer is easier to clean and change the water, and doesn't have a carbon footprint except for when it was made. I'm going back to that."
2,Petmate pet fountain,"I had one of these I bought when they first hit the market because I have a cat who loves to drink from faucets. He loved the fountain!After about 8 years of working great the water flow valve broke. I bought this one a couple of months ago and even though the fountain works great and my cat is happy with it, the auto fill cap on the bottom of the reservoir doesn't work at all. I can't figure out why and have tried every thing I can think of to get it to work. The first one worked fine, filling the bowl automatically as the water level went down. With this new one I have to do it manually. I make sure the bowl is filled to nearly overflowing every morning so that I don't have to worry about the water dropping so low that the pump doesn't have enough water to pump while I'm at work all day. Not sure if this one is just a lemon or if the design has been changed??? When I replace this one, it will be with a different model!"
4,Excellent addition for our cats,This had its pros and cons but overall it is a great item. My cats drank more often and quickly warmed up to drinking from it. They stopped begging for water from out of the sink once they got this. It can get a little noisy when the pump gets clogged or it's low on water. After a year everything ran great mechanically but the plastic and bottom cracked causing a leak. I purchased the Deluxe version to replace it.
2,Flow no more,"We purchase this item for our two cats, trying to break one of them from sitting in the shower. Initially we were please and the cats loved it...but after a few months this item just didn't hold up. Cleaning it every other day was miserable too. There has to be something better out there. The pump in this one just ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH and maintainence is MISERABLE!"
5,Worth every penny,"I've wanted to buy one of these fountains for my kitties for years.Last week it was one of the Deals on Amazon, so I splurged and bought a $25 gift for my kitties!They love it. I like having it there, it makes barely any noise, just a light trickle. The kitties love it, drink from it and play with the water stream.It's got a nice long cord, though I need an extension to put it where I want it. I like the on/off switch on the cord, and the water filter. It came with extra filters, at least a year's supply. Great value."
2,Didn't work long,"I had trouble getting the pump to work, but after messing with the cord some it worked. The fountain only worked for about 3 months and then quit. I wouldn't recommend buying it."
1,Do not buy if you have a medium sized dog.,"I have a english bulldog and I thought it would be nice to have because he drinks so much water throughout the day. The amount of water that is in it is just fine. But it gets dirty so fast! Its like having a regular bowl but its electrionic with three pieces and its a real trouble to take apart just to clean two times a day! Please do not buy it if you have a medium sized dog. It will be disgusting within hours. So much for having ""filtered"" water."
5,Cats Love It!,"My three cats love this water fountain. This is the 2nd Petmate Fresh Flow Fountain I've bought for them, finally had to replace the 1st after it started to leak after many years of use. Two of my cats love to drink the water from the waterfall, one laps from the pool. Customer service has been great in the past. When I accidentally dropped the water reservoir full of water and it cracked, they replaced it for me free of charge."
5,A great product at a great price!,"I recently purchased this fountain for my two male cats and they love it! It's very quiet and my cats drink the water right as it comes down the ramp. I know some people were annoyed about the difficulties they had cleaning the unit...I found a simple solution. A baby bottle cleaning brush! Most of them have a nipple cleaner built into the handle and it's just the right size to fit it the small spaces of the fountain. I tend to clean mine at least twice a week, and I change the water everyday. This is probably not necessary for everyone, but I like to make sure my cats are getting the cleanest water possible."
2,OK... hard to clean!,The fountain works fine although the filter does leak a bit into the bowl so that it gets dirty very fast. I would not reccomend this fountain b/c it is very awkward to clean and refill which needs to be done often. Would be good if the company created a way to take out the bowl seperate from the entire fountain.
1,Poor Quality Fountain,"This is my 2nd Petmate fountain. My first one lasted about 1 year, then stopped working. This one never worked well. I have it on full flow, and water barely comes out. Not worth the cost of electricity to run it. Pay a little more, and get a better quality fountain."
2,clogged,If you do not take this apart and clean everday cat hair seems to clog up the pump. if I was to design this product you would think the filter would go before the pump to keep trash or cat hair from entering the pump. Would be a great product without that one problem.
2,not impressed,"I have two long-haired cats, and within a week the pump was completely clogged. The little grate that keeps hair out of the pump is almost useless. Taking it completely apart and cleaning did restore flow for a bit, but now, after a couple of months, even that doesn't work anymore. The 'waterfall' has slowed to a trickle, and I suspect the pump is just about dead. Also, the bottle only holds a day or so of water, so for longer trips, I have to break out my old gravity-feed bottle anyway."
4,Work well so far,* Purchased at PetSmart* Seems to work well* Very quiet when operating properly* Took our cats a little over a week to get used to it* The flow isn't very good when the setting is low. We keep it at medium.* I clean it out about once a week. Cat hair from our medium-haired cat builds up and can clog the motor and scum forms on the sides of the drinking well.
5,Great product for the money.,"I've owned this fountain for over a month now and love it. It is easy to clean and is small enough to ""hide"" in my living room and not be in the way. My cat is drinking much more water than before and seems to enjoy playing with the little water fall. You do need to refill the water often (the pump will make an audible noise when the water is low) but the fountain is great overall."
5,Cats love this product,I purchased this product for my cats. They love it. It keeps the water clean and fresh. I don't have to dump and refill daily.
4,Some Great Help for Fresh Flow Problems,"I've had two of these fountains, and several family members also have them. Yes, weird things happen, and at least one was returned to company with pump problems. For whatever reason, they do not include the following information routinely in their packaging. For a pdf that illustrates routine cleaning, and some FAQ's, go to: [...] You need to take the pump apart and despite the instructions in pdf, use the pointed type q-tips, a wire cake tester, in-between-teeth cleaner brush(really), you get the idea, to clean it inside and out! My cats love this fountain, but we joke that one of them has a ""drinking problem,"" because she likes to belly-up at front of fountain and drink from waterfall, resulting in a drenched bib. The pdf should address many of the common complaints about this product. Good luck!"
1,No Zero Star Rating for truly worthless products?,"I have to say, I thought I was just unlucky. Had a previous pump water bowl that died on me and got this one. Boy, that pump in there has got to be a joke. Plus every couple days I get tons of crud floating in the water, what is up with that, the other one I had never built up a bunch of crap in a couple days.Plus, again, the pump absolutely does no good, I get a little trickle of water with as much water as I can fit in the bowl. Any more and it would be on the floor.No thanks, never again will I buy this product."
5,Love this!,"I have been so glad I bought this pet fountain for my four cats. I have not experienced any of the cleaning or noise problems mentioned in other reviews. As long as you keep the water level up and ""prime"" the pump when filling there is no problem with noise. I clean it every other time I fill it and occasionally wipe it out with bleach and have had no problems. The only regret I have is that I didn't buy a larger model!"
2,keeps leaking,"We have had this for several months, and often when we refill the tank it apparently doesn't get seated correctly and the water runs out all at once. The worst part is that it happens slowly (overnight), and we can't find where it runs out of the base. So it is not until we wait an hour or so before we know if it is seated or not. There are no rubber seals or springs to help prevent this.It runs very quietly at first until the filter starts to get clogged with cat hair or saliva, rinsing provides some short time relief but it can be a good indicator that it is time to change it. The motor runs fine after 6 months, with infrequent cleaning."
5,cat loves it,"had one similar to this so i was kinda going on that in comparison. Well not my cat only wants to drink from it. No more sips from a regular water bowl... lol, i spoiled him."
4,love it!!!,my cat and dog love this water bowl. and it keeps the water clean. the filters say only use 30 days but i leave mine in at least 60 because they are still good until then.
2,"Leaking Petmate Deluxe Flow Pet Fountain, white.","This item leaks all the time, I have to fill it two to three times a day because for sosme reason the water leaks out from the bottom, especially when it gets low on water. I cannot figure out why it leaks all the time. I would not recommend this to anyone. I am now on Amazon looking for a better drinking fountain ffor my i catThomas Bennett"
2,Didn't Work for me,"My cat loves to drink out of my sink because of the fresh water. So I thought this would do the trick. It didnt. At first my cat liked it, she would come over and drink it. But it made too much noise, so she wouldn't drink it. Then after a month the pump messed up and we had to buy a new one. I would only use this one as a last resort."
4,Needed slight modification,"I am pleased with the size and water capacity though I was instantly disappointed with the water dribble. I found an easy solution I thought I would share. I inserted a 1"" diameter clear tube, 6"" in length into the exit hole. I trimmed the height of the tube slightly so that it would fit snug into the opening and wa la, instant waterfall. The tube was just a standard fish tank hydro-lift tube used for under gravel filter systems.You can play with the length and orientation of the tube to fit your animals needs."
5,This fountain is awesome,"I have two big dogs and I was afraid that this would have to be refilled everyday however, it has a very large capacity. My dogs haven't drank out of the toilet since we got this fountain!!! I am very happy with it. Only problem is when they drink after they eat so food particles get to the very bottom, but I read someone else's review about using a clean fish net to get it out and it works great!! This is definitely a must have!!!"
2,Didn't Appeal to my Cat,"While many cats like drinking from the tub/sink faucet, this product does NOT mimic that experience very well at all. I wouldn't expect every cat to like this fountain when the water moves so smoothly and somewhat uninterestingly down the ramp. I thought the water moving would attract my cat but it is pretty hard to see the water at all. My cat was interested for 10 minutes and was done with it for good. The fountain is quiet, and yes, you have to clean it and monitor it so the pump doesn't burn out. Overall it was more trouble than it was worth. Not recommended. I would try the fountains that bubble or have the water free-falling down from the spout. At least it would attract my cat."
4,A decent product for the price,The biggest gripe I have with the fountain is that it is noisy sometimes for no apparent reason. For the best results clean the fountain regularly and you probably will have a long and uneventful experiance. My two cats get along with it fine although one drinks from the pool at the base while the other drinks from the top right where the water passes through the filter but what would you expect there cats.
1,7 week lifespan.,"Pets liked the fountain. But, the little motor went out after 7 weeks. We did essential cleaning about every 4 days..with little brush and Q-tips. Also changed out the water daily, removing little floating cat hairs. I changed filter every 2 weeks. We are disappointed in the outcome of this purchase. I will try once more..hopefully the first fountain was just a ""lemon""."
1,Petmate Water Fountain leaks,I ordered this water fountain for my cats. I was very dissapointed to find that the thing leaks and had actually destroyed our hard wood floors due to the leakage. I reccomend if you purchase this to make sure yours does not leak on any delecate surfaces.
3,Loved It At First,"When I first got the water fountain, I loved it. It was perfect for my cat who will only drink running water!! Problem is, the motor stopped working after I had only had it for 6 months. I dont know how long they are supposed to last, but 6 months seemed a short amount of time."
2,Did not last long at all!,I bought this fountain because my cat loves drinking running water and for the first couple of months I loved it. It would have to be refilled constantly but I didn't mind because my cat was deliriously happy with it.Then the leaking started. Just a small dribble out the side so I cleaned it (which I did every week anyway) to no avail. The leak kept worse and worse and made my kitchen floor a mess. I had only had it four months and was pissed!My story is by no means the only one. My friend had the same thing happen to her after about 6 months. Just don't waste your money.
2,"Cats like it, but it's NOT EASY TO CLEAN","I didn't think there'd be another fountain as difficult to clean as a Drinkwell. This one is (the right hand upper section must be removed, and it's a bear to get off and on because it fits so tightly).Also - and this is not a criticism, because I misjudged capacity - but the medium size is not meant for a house with more than two cats."
2,"kitties like it, but they don't do the cleaning","We have one of these and one Drinkwell, and the kitties seem equally happy with either one. The Petmate is a bit quieter, but is even more difficult to clean, which needs to be done more often than I'd like. Neither one is a day at the beach to clean, but the Petmate has even more little nooks and crannies and narrow little spots that are almost impossible to get the gunk out of. And as soon as you're done and fill it with fresh water, it starts getting icky again before you know it. Since there's no obvious useful purpose for all the little hard to reach spots, I can only conclude that whoever designed these things likes cats OK, but hates their owners."
3,"Decent product, not worth the price.","I bought this product for my 3 cats and they rarely drink it. Maybe because they were so used to drinking from the sink faucet that they want something a little more fresh? The product itself is hard to clean and maintain. There are two filter bags that comes with the product, and I don't even know when it loses it's effectiveness. The filter bag does get dirty quickly and I'm sure it gets pricey to keep on replacing it. Overall for me, I should have just bought a Brita filter and attach it to the sink for the cats to drink."
4,I would recommend this product,"I purchased the Fresh Flow Fountain because one of my cats is very picky about the water he drinks. He was refusing to drink the water I put out for him in a bowl, and would try to drink out of my husband's and my cups when we put them down. We have 2 cats and 2 small dogs, and they all love drinking the water from the fountain. They were all a little nervous about using it at first, but it didn't take long for them to adjust. My only complaint is that with 4 animals drinking from the same fountain, the pump becomes clogged pretty quickly and the filters need to be replaced frequently. It is very easy to clean and maintain."
3,Cat loves it; too much trouble,"My cat really enjoys this item; I do not. The flow lever broke off completely soon after I purchased it. It makes a lot of noise sometimes, especially if the water level gets too low. The pump is often full of cat fur. Still, if you're willing to put up with maintaining the fountain, your cat may love it as much as mine does. The filters are hard to find. (I don't use them anymore.) Wendell DOES drink from the slide and really loves his fountain, so I guess it's worth it."
2,Take note of this review before buying,"I bought 2 of these things within a 3 1/2 year period. The theory behind what it is supposed to do is different from what it actually does. The problem is the water needs to be filtered before it reaches the electric pump, not after. As your pet drinks, saliva from your pet will cake up around the water intake of the pump. After a couple weeks, the intake gets clogged up with a thick brown mucus and the pump begins to overwork itself trying to suck up water to push through the filter on the other side. If you don’t stay on top of cleaning it by rinsing the pump with hot water, which is an involved and messy process of taking the whole Petmate apart, the pump will burn itself out after a short period and then you have to go out and buy a whole new Petmate.It’s not a wonder they’re only guaranteed for a year because each one I bought lasted about a year and two to four months."
1,Not a good item,This item is too noisy and hard to keep clean(a film builds up on it). I would pass on this.
2,Pumps go out,"Bought a couple of these in the past and the same thing always happens, the pump goes out and its cheaper to buy a new one rather than a new pump"
3,like the fountain,"I was disappointed that the motor for the fountain is LOUD and that there were no return instructions included with the fountain. I'm using it and its a great fountain, just disappointed with a few things."
5,Works for me,Again another gift. Dummy filled it and left the cats and dogs at it. Dogs lapped all the water and burned out the motor. I'm not buying another.
4,Inexpensive,"Very affordable, easy to set up. Keep in mind you will need an electrical outlet. Despite it has a filter the water gets dirty so you will have to give it a weekly maintenance. Fits in my small kitchen and my kitten loves it!"
2,Dead in 50 days.,"I really like the fountain but the pump died in under 50 days since purchased. it never ran low on water and it was clean inside and out, I am trying to get a replacement pump from petmate, but I will try a Drinkwell brand next time."
2,too dirty,The cats certainly liked it (we have 4!) but it's a pain to clean and it needs it often. Plus it's difficult to get align it back together with the pump. Always a challenge.
1,They Leak. Not Worth It!,"I've had 2 of these devices in the past 2 years. They are a nightmare to clean and they need cleaning often. With both devices, I came home to a kitchen floor with a water puddle and no water in the bowl, but no signs of leakage before the flood. Husband bought a different kind this time and hope it works better. I don't recommend this product."
2,Not worth it,I'm not sure how but water keeps puddling up underneath the unit. I have only had it for about a week and already I am sick and tired of having to clean up water. Not worth it if you ask me.
1,Don't waste your money,"I have two cats and thought this was going to be a sensation for them. I was immediately disillusioned though when I had to fill it every other day. Not enough storage for two cats. Then, after about 3 to 4 months it started making a noise like a coffee grinder even though the reservior was full. The reservior stopped adding water and it has to be filled twice daily with a water glass to stop the noise, even though the reservior is full. When the replacement arrives, I'll escort this thing to the dumpster. On the plus side? The cats like it."
2,Very Cumbersome!,"This product is VERY jumbo! I bought this for my kittens, because they love to gather together at feeding time so I thought they'd enjoy having room to drink at the same time. The main problem with this is that sediment gathers at the bottom of the well very easily and the filter isn't strong enough to get it out. So basically every day you have to unplug it, drag the power cord to the nearest sink, and get the whole thing in the sink to rinse it out without spilling water all over the place. I was unhappy with this product and I really couldn't see myself going through all that hassle every day to rinse out the well, so I returned the product."
2,GET THE DELUXE MODEL,"I had the deluxe model, and thought it wasn't working correctly, and I ordered this model, which did not work water gurgled out the sides. I cleaned the deluxe model with vinegar and it is working again! it keeps water circulating and my siamese and jack russell seem to drink more water .. get the deluxe model, you won't be sorry."
2,blah,"It worked fine for a week and then its just a giant pain to keep working properly. Even with the water level at where it should be, the petmate makes odd sounds. I prefer a regular water dish after using this product."
2,Not good for mulit cats households.,"I must say that my cats do enjoy drinking running water. I first encountered a problem with this product with in its first week of use. mainly, my cats would reach their paw in the hole that the water comes out of and rip holes in the filter cartridge.The cartirage is poorly designed in the first place. it is made of a felty material the is just asking to be ripped apart. my second, and finial problem with this product is the lack of filtering on the water pump. This product is made for pets, you would think that they would put a filter of some kind infront of the pump to prevent it from being clogged with fur. well they didnt. my pump would clog with fur at least once per week. i had this product for 3 months when the pump stopped working."
1,Disappointed,Good for a few weeks. Now it starts to make loud girdling noises. Now the water seems to SLOWLY leak. Water ran well when I first got it but after a few weeks (3 weeks) the water seems to stop running (now only leaking drip by drip). The girdling sound is so loud that it scares my cat. I put enough water in this thing but I really do not know why the machine is not pump smoothly and powerfully even at max setting. Waste of money.UPDATE: Actually you need to clean the INSIDE of the product to remove the cat hair that gets stuck on the pump. When you remove the hair it works fine.
1,VERY sorry!,"Before purchasing this Freshflow Fountain I 'watered' my dogs via a stainless-steel bowl in a raised feeeding-station. Having bought the LARGEST one which is quite expensive, I now truly wish I'd stayed with that arrangement. When I'm out of filters (bought three packages w/fountain) I shall go BACK to previous arrangement!This thing is AWFUL to clean; there are numerous crevices & corners that my long/narrow brush cannot reach & believe me, it needs cleaning at least twice weekly. I have two Yorkies & a Golden, so it gets well-used but even so, it's extremely labor-intensive. The fountain is just TOO much work to give them a clean, sanitary container from which to drink. It is is VERY heavy when the water-level is as it needs to be; lifting it to the sink is very hard on one's back, especially for those of us who are seniors, as am I.The ads for this are VERY misleading, 'easy to clean'? Not hardly, this thing is a nightmare!Sincerely, V. Le Gare"
2,"If I had a time machine, I would stop myself from buying this","I have a dog and 2 cats.This product seemed like a great idea: fresh flowing water, filtered and clean. I thought it would make my life a little easier, but it just annoyed me instead.My main problems with the fountain are the noises it makes when the water get a little low, and the gunk that builds up inside the bowl. The noise is so irritating that I ended up packing the fountain away and going back to regular water in a bowl.If I upgrade from the regular bowl again I would just get one of those ""water cooler"" style water bowls with a reservoir of water and no moving parts."
2,"Below Average, Needs Constant Cleaning / Disassembly","The water pump is designed such that it will constantly take in cat hair and other miscellany, meaning you'll be unclogging it constantly as water flow diminishes to an almost invisible trickle.The device is only slightly more convenient than just pouring a bowl of fresh water daily. Not recommended."
2,Lousy Product,"Does NOT filter water like you would imagine. Food bits and debri still remain at bottom of bowl. It empties quickly (we only have one dog) and it is not easy to refill. Very dissappointed in the product. I do not use it any more, just use a regular water bowl."
1,Works great at first.,"We bought this for our cats, hoping to provide a constant flow of clean water. It's better than having a bowl, with standing water. The first 3 months of owning it, it worked great! Our cats loved playing in the stream of water, and it made us feel better to give them clean, filtered water. How wrong we were! Due to constant water being inside the bowl, mold starts forming inbetween the creases of plastic. We cleaned and changed the water regularly, but there was no avoiding the mold. Soon after, we noticed that the water was barely trickling out of the top. We had to take the entire thing apart & clean out the pump due it being clogged with fur. It worked well after that, but the mold kept forming and it was in places where you couldn't clean well. I used a toothbrush and hot hot water to no avail. This thing has been more trouble than it's worth. Now we're back to a small water bowl, looking for a decent replacement."
1,"Problems, Problems, Problems All Day Long","- ""Problems, Problems, Problems All Day Long"" Like the old Everly Brothers song, this product has been nothing but ongoing problems. The little tank in the back never drains properly, the fountain doesn't run well for more than a day without some kind of an assist, the little screen that's supposed to catch debris before it's pulled into the filtration system is a nightmare to remove and reinstall......and so it goes on and on. TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY! I should have sent it back, but I'm usually very handy with gadgets of all kinds, and just kept believing I could make this 'lemon' work well. I was wrong this time. DON'T BUY THIS ONE... GET SOMETHING IN CERAMIC OR STAINLESS STEEL INSTEAD, FROM ANOTHER COMPANY !!! PETMATE SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THIS INFERIOR PRODUCT!"
1,Do not buy this item!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11,"First of all the pet mate water for cats that I have leaks, it also is VERY noisy, I might have a defective produc, but for $40,oo dollars this is a disaster! Now that I've used it and thrown out the Box I won't beable to return it. Luckily I kept my other Pet Mate water which is larger, doesn/t leak and is alot quieter. The only thing that does work well is the cleaner package that you order separetly, don't really know why I even purchased this, the old one just needed a good cleaning which I did with the cleaning utensils"
3,"OK, but has problems","This is a really cool item, but there are a few things I didn't like about it.* You have to fill it up way too much - part of the reason we wanted this was to have clean water constantly but were filling 2-3 times a day for our dog. It would probably be ok for a small pet.* Another problem we had is that the flow would clog because of pet hair and it would have to be disassembled and cleaned quite a bit.We ended up going back to teh regular bowl. I would recomment for cats or a small pet, but definitely not for a large one."
1,Will they ever use add a good enough pump?,"Twice I've used this device and each time the pump was pathetic. Out of the box the water only trickles and in less than a month it is impossible to tell if water is coming out unless I put my finger against the ramp. Each time I tried using this something broke, whether it was the pump or the cheap plastic pump, I could never keep this up and running for more than 6 months. Not to mention it was always dirty. I don't mean I had to clean it every other week. Every morning I would have to wash it out and twice a day I was adding a liter of water.This thing is useless."
3,Fresh Flow. Yay? Or Nay?,"When I got this product I paid nearly $40 for it. It came with 2 charcoal filters to clean the water that your cat drinks. The pump inside the unit takes up one plug and also keeps the water cool. Now, if your cat spills some food in it or a bug falls in it, it wont filter. ( -1 Four Stars) It will stay in the dish on the bottom and you have to take it out. Also there is a compartment that is blue and stores water, however it hold a very small amount. When I fill it up in about a day it needs more water. You know when it needs more water when you hear the gurgling sound it makes. (-1 Three Stars)It is very quiet when it is filled with water though. I've noticed that the charcoal filters only last about a month. ( I think they are $6 if you go out and buy a replacement. Dont worry the filters are very small. Overall I would give it a yay. Try it to see if you like it. If you don't you can return it."
2,A step above a water bowl,"I suppose it does the job for the most part however, the pump isn't powerful enough to circulate the debris that collects in the bowl and what it does circulate seems to collect in the pump well or adhere to the pump. For the hair, liter and occasional food that we clean out of the bowl and pump well, I don't really see where any of the debris makes it as far as the filter. I've seen particles of debris just swirl around in front of the pump well and never get filtered through. I would definitely rethink other brands if I purchased another one."
2,NOISY!,We bought this fountain because it had raved reviews and our kitten had been jumping all over the place to get fresh flowing water. We were looking for a fountain that would also benefit us by not being a distraction. He continuously swatted at it for the noise it would make to look for where it was coming from the first few weeks we had it. We clean it regularly and make sure it had a clean filter in it but it still runs very noisy on a daily basis. I've tried putting something under it to see if that helps but nothing seems to matter. It runs so noisy when its on that we've come to shutting it off. THe noise that it makes is similar to a refrigerator when it runs. IF anyone knows about a super quiet one can you please let us know?
3,Good idea but it's flaw kills it.,"We actually bought this fountain at Rural King a year ago. It seemed to work fine for a month or two but I noticed that every time I filled the reservoir, it would leak out half the water onto our kitchen floor.I stopped filling the reservoir and it helped but also meant I had to fill the fountain with half a glass of water twice a day (two cats) to keep it from either getting too low and making that sucking sound or getting too high and overflowing.When it does overflow, it seems to come from the lid at the back and it usually dumps a large amount of the water. I think the motor may kick up too much turbulence in the water at the top and causes the leak.For this reason, i will be retiring this fountain and trying something else."
3,2 Cats 2 different experiences,"We got this drining fountain the other day as one of our cats has been dehydrated and the vet suggested a product like this. The cat that we got it for seems to like it, but our other cat is terrified of it. He hisses at it and we have a hard time getting him to go in the room with it. So with one problem solved we uncovered another one."
3,"Does the basic filtering, but..","the filters become dirty VERY QUICKLY. My dogs like it, but I just find that after a short period of time, the filter became dirty and brown fast, which deters from the promised filter life on the box. I wouldn't mind it so much if the initial purchase came with a fair amount of filter to last a decent amount of time, like 3-4 months. Overall, if my dogs like it, I'm fine with it."
1,Loud,My cat like this as long as I washed it Every day. Filters need replacement each week. If not cleaned slime grows quickly like in two days. It is LOUD and big.Threw it away.
4,It's Super,It is very useful with a houseful of cats and dog.It is rather cumbersome to fill but that can be overcome.It does make a vibrating noise on my tile floor. Amworking on a solution.Worth the money.
5,Highly recommended,"I have had it for maybe 6 years. Also purchased the other type, I forget the name of that brand, it has more of a spout than this one, which is more of a flow. I have 8 cats, some really like the flow, some just want to drink from a bowl. I don't consider this noisy. I don't bother with the filter, consider that kind of useless. If the pump gets blocked by junk (will occur with or without using a filter) it will get noisy, or if the water gets low. That is your clue to add water or clean it. If you ever shelled out $500 because one of your cats had urinary blockage, you don't consider anything that encourages your cats to drink more water a bad idea. I also suggest filtered water (I use the attachment for my tap), cats really go for filtered water more. Bottom line, some of my cats just love this, and they all prefer it to the alternate brand. My tom's all go for it, and male cats are more prone to urinary blockage."
3,"great, except for the motor","I originally got this about 2 years ago for my cats and they loved it. It's a pain to clean, and it has to be cleaned regularly or it gets a weird slimey film inside the bowl.The motor started dying this spring so I bought a replacement motor, for 2/3 the cost of the original unit. The replacement motor I got was faulty so it makes a very loud hum. I'm going to try my luck with a Drinkwell fountain instead."
3,Finicky Cat Owners Beware...,"I think this is a great product. However, my finicky cat refuses to drink from it. I left it there for a month with another water bowl in a different location and she refused to use the pet fountain. I wound up giving it to a friend with 2 non-finicky cats. So, beware if your cat is attached to their water bowl."
2,Worked for 6 months and died,"The fountain worked for 6 months and the poor quality of the pump I noticed when I put it together came through and died on me this week. After reading another negative review, I will try the drinkwell."
2,Not overly pleased,"Had our Petmate for just over a year. I just tonight threw it in the garbage. When we first got it, it took my 2 cats over a month before they would go near it. They seemed to like it okay after that. About a month ago I found it had been leaking a little. I took it apart, cleaned it and it appeared to be okay. I never did figure out why it was leaking or from where. Tonight after being gone all day, I came home to find a big puddle of water on the floor. Again I can't see why it's leaking or where it's coming from. I had it setting next to the microwave stand which now has water damage around the bottom. Leason learned. I guess the cats will just have to get used to the old fashoned bowl of water again."
4,Cat water dish,"The pet smart water dish was noisy when it arrived and the manufacture was prompt in replacing the motor. Works well, Rusty seems to like it. Would purchase it again. Useful as you only need to add water about every other day. After a couple of weeks took it apart, which is easy and ran it through the dish washer. Bill"
3,kitty fountain,"My cat and kitten love the fountain, and drink more water than they would from their bowls. The water in the reservoir lasts about 3 days. The only issue I have at all is that the fountain is a little noisy. You would not want it in your TV room. I am glad to have this product, and would buy it again."
3,Keeps cats from spilling water,"This item keeps my cats from spilling their water but it is hard to keep clean, runs out of water rather quickly, and tends to be quite noisy when it is low on water and even sometimes when it isn't. It does do what I wanted it to, though, and it was not a bad price with free shipping."
3,Petmate Fresh Flow fountain - quality control problems,"I've had three of these, and my mother has had two. I've found that the older ones are better than the newer ones: pumps last longer, are quieter, and the pieces fit together better. The new ones (I've bought three in two years, for two households) have come with defective pumps, parts that jam together and are then impossible to separate for cleaning, and with parts missing. I think the company moved their production to a different facility, or in the case of the pumps may have switched suppliers, and they can't maintain quality control.That said, if you get a good unit, it's a very good product: quiet, easy to clean, and my cats and dog all took to it quickly. But it must be cleaned frequently to keep gunk out of the pump - especially if you have a dog that uses it as a post-dinner face wash!"
2,Good idea.....but........,"Great idea of flowing water. Fresh water is the hope, but in reality it's dirty water. I bought this, ran it for 2 days, and noticed black mold. I took it apart to clean it and was so disgusted by the amount of mold and slime, I cleaned it (took forever with all the parts) and took it back to the store. I just couldn't bear the thought of my dog drinking from that thing."
1,We stopped using it!,"This thing is supposed to provide fresh water for your pets, right? Well we stopped using ours and went back to the old water bowl, because dust would build up on the surface of the water. The water flow was slow, not providing good filteration. The dish gets scummy fast, and the filters got nasty in just a couple of days. Before long we found mold in the filer and inside the machine. It is not easy to clean, and requires constant maintainance. We stopped using the filer for a while and it worked a little better, but what is the point of that? I wouldn't reccomend buying one - I'd give you ours if I could."
2,Great for short-term use...,"This product is great for about 1-2 years. Over time, the motor will get bits and pieces of your pets' fur and food, which causes the motor to break down, even with regular cleaning. I found no way to purchase a replacement motor, so I was really bummed (as were my cats!).I ended up purchasing a new fountain, but upgraded to theDrinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain. I highly recommend that fountain because it has a small guard that blocks food, fur, and other particles from getting into the motor and its' reservoir."
4,"Cats like it, good quality","We've had this fountain for over 2 years, and it hasn't given us any problems. The cats get nice fresh-flowing water, it's relatively easy to clean, and it runs quietly. The occasional gurgling motor other reviewers mentioned is a good reminder to refill it (or sometimes - to clean the pump). Highly recommend it."
5,Happy for Five Years,"Like other people, I bought this to reclaim my sinks. I had 4 cats and had to wait my turn to brush my teeth. This wasn't an automatic replacement, I still had to just stop letting the cats drink out of the sinks.But here we are 5 years later and the thing is still humming along. I refill the water about once a day. I super clean it with Q-Tips and paper towels about once a month, including the motor.I never had a leaking problem with the filters. I did however get a little scared about 2 years ago when I couldn't find replacement filters anywhere. But since then they have reappeared so the crisis has been averted."
3,"returned item as it was too small, no complaints about actual item","I love these fountains, this particular one was small and I returned it and ordered the large."
1,New Pump too powerful for product,We bought this new Petmate Fresh Flow to replace an existing unit that had served us well for several years but which was becoming difficult to clean. Unfortunately the pump on the new product for some reason no longer has adjustable flow although the flow control lever is still there but intentionally frozen in the maximum position. This results in a very noisy product with water overflowing the internal filter reservoir continually. We installed the pump for our old unit and all is well but this new product appears to have a significant flaw.
2,Frequent Pump Problems,"I purchased this product 1 year ago and immediately my cat loved it. The first pump went out after about 6 months so I bought a replacement pump, the replacement pump was fine except that it was more powerful so the water gurgled out of the top seam causing puddling on the floor. After about a month the pumps efficiency diminished enough that it did not puddle anymore. That pump lasted about 5 months so I put in another replacement pump. I am currently dealing with the same situation of the over zealous pump causing leaking and puddling.The unit is easy to fill and easy to clean but I am currenly online searching for a different brand. As much as my cat loves his water dish I can't deal with the leaking. I would not recommend this product."
2,Would be great if it didn't leak,"The cats like the fountain, but it leaks unless the water level is very low. Since many people don't have this problem I suspect that it depends on how tight the joints between the various parts are. Sealing the joints won't work because the device needs to be taken apart for cleaning.If you get one, be prepared to send it back if it leaks.Edit: While the bottom of the fountain appears to be cast as a single piece, there is a small square plate on the bottom of the unit where the pump fits. Over time the glue loosens and this leaks where it is attached. This can be fixed by a bit of epoxy around the seam."
2,Poor design,"Like the previous review, this product does require alot of cleaning. I, along with my mother who also purchased one at the same time, had problems with leakage. I narrowed it down to the holes in the bottom portion that the top portion hooks into. Once I taped the holes over and broke off the connectors on the top portion, the leaking stopped. However, one week later the motor died. This happened only three months after purchase despite thorough cleaning once a week. My cat loved it, but I wouldn't buy from this company again."
3,Dangerous?,"My cat loves water from a fountain. However, he tends to drink from the top. With this fountain, he was literally licking the glaze off of the plastic. With the concerns of lead paint lately and even the chemicals that are in plastic, I immediately through this one away and replaced it with the Drinkwell (where water comes out of a spout). I haven't had any problems since."
2,Petmate Deluxe Fresh Flow Pet Fountain,I owned this product prior to ordering a new one as the pump shot craps on the old one. The old one I had worked great. The new one that I just got is very noisy. In fact we had to put it in a room downstairs so that it wouldn't keep us up at night. It seems to make a loud buzzing sound that is very irritating and distracting. Taking off the top part of the waterer to clean it is also very difficult with this new one. The old one was a cinch to clean. With this new one I have to pry the parts apart with a knife in order to disassemble it for cleaning. I don't know what happened in the manufacturing process but the new one is certainly not as good as the former product.
2,Good for nothing!!,This was great for a month.Then the pump gears started to grind.It continued to work but it was extremly loud.
2,Love Fresh Flow Fountains But..............,"I have 3 cats who refuse to drink water from a regular bowl. The 1st fountain I purchased for them was a Fresh Flow and they loved it. I wanted a 2nd fountain and since they also like drinking water from a running tap, I thought I would try the Drinkwell, which has a larger water capacity. They definitely prefer the Fresh Flow. When my Fresh Flow began to make noise after 1 1/2 yrs, I purchased this new Fresh Flow Fountain in the larger size. Although it is silent when you 1st turn it on, after a short while, it begins to make a very annoying noise. I think this particular fountain must be defective, because I have since bought another Fresh Flow (but again in the smaller size) and it is totally silent. My cats definitely like the Fresh Flow almost to the exclusion of the Drinkwell, but this large size one is just too noisy to use."
2,Great Idea with a weak and flawed pump,"I've now had this fountain for a little over 2 months and the pump is starting to fail.As is, if I unplug it, to start it again I need to open up the pump and push the impeller to get it spinning. Without the initial push to get it running, it simply doesn't start.Also, do not think that this fountain will replace your water dish or be less of a hassle. In fact, this will require a tremendous amount of effort to keep running.Daily Maintenance:Clean out cat/dog hair from the mesh.Fill up.Every Other day:Clean the inside filter.Weekly:Take completely apart, wash out all gunk, hair, dirt etc.Open the pump, push the impeller to get it started.Oh and both the cats and dogs seem to prefer the old large water dish as opposed to the fountain, which they also use, but not nearly as much."
4,Cats Love It,"This is a great water dish. It's easy to refill and the cats love the flowing water. The kitten likes to play with it. The only thing I do not like is that the cat hair that gets in the dish is not as easy to clean since you have to lift the entire thing up and dump the water in the sink (and clean it out) once in a while. Other than that slight inconvenience, it's great because the water lasts a long time (large tank) and the cats really love it!"
4,cat fountain,"I would recommend this fountain to anyone. It is easy to clean and I have not had an issue with the pump or noise or leaking. It was a reasonable price and the cats,Sweetie,April, and Sam all approve. I do think that next time I will get a larger one but in the meantime this one is just great."
4,Petmate Deluxe Fresh Flow Fountain medium.,"I have two cats that took to it right away. I had seen it at my sisters and since one of my cats liked to drink out of the sink it seemed only natural he'd like it, and he did.The only problem I have is the noise. Air always gets trapped in the chamber before the filter and creates and audible sound. But I have it in my kitchen so I notice it there.Overall, I'd recommend it."
1,Petmate Fountain dish Leaks,"This products sounds better than it is. The noise it makes scared my cats away - they would drink water from any OTHER dish than that one. After about 2 weeks, the dish began to leak, leaving a puddle on the wood floor, warping it before I realized it had a leak."
4,Petmate water fountain is a very good item,This Petmate medium size water fountain has turned out to be a very good item compared to the last Petmate medium one that I had bought several years ago. This has a slightly more powerful water pump compared to my last one. The water filters with the fountain is the only thing that slows the water flow down too much after a few days of running. Their filters are quite thick in substance for the water to flow through. I have found that the small Whisper brand of water filters for the fish tanks work real well with this water fountain versus using Petmates filters.
2,My cats won't drink out of a bowl anymore!,"EDIT: I liked it. My cats liked it. But the d@mn thing started leaking after only a month. Slow and gradual, but there was definitely a puddle on our wood floors every day that no towel could keep in check. It was thrown out. My kitties were upset. As was I...what a waste of money!"
2,Sometimes what seems like a great idea isn't,I bought this from a pet store because I thought constant fresh water was a great idea. But it isn't really fresh water it's water being recycled through a charcoal filter. Like anything with standing water it must be cleaned. After struggling with this product for a year I finally gave up and went back to putting fresh water in a bowl twice a day for the cat - and that is much easier. Not to mention the cat didn't seem to care one way or the other. Save your money and buy more catnip - something the cat WILL care about!
4,much better than catit fountain,I thought the catit fountain would work but it bit the dust after a few months. This was the logical replacement and it's quiet and works great!
3,fresh flow countain,"this product is a good concept, but does require the owner to maintain it on a daily basis. Foor, hair and general debris will collect in the filter area, and the area where the pump connects to the water channeling control lever. If this is not maintained and the entire product cleaned on a regular basis (for one pet, as often as every 3 days; for more than one pet user, every day is essential, to keep the water fresh. The resevoir has a limited capacity for fresh water, so keeping a supply of new filters on hand is also strongly recommended. It has been helpful to us and our pets, because the water is fresh, and there is usually no problem with overflow or leakage. All in all, for what you get, it's a fair price and a decent enough product."
3,Petmate Fresh Flow Pet Fountain Large Black,"My 2 dogs, tiny havanese 12 lbs and labadoodle 50 lbs are definitely drinking better now with this rather than the bowl however it runs out of water very fast! I bought the size according to the directions and this just doesn't seem to be enough. I am filling it more than the bowl. So although they like it, it didn't solve them always having enough."
2,Leaky.....Loud.....,"I thought this would be a good choice for my dog since I figured he deserved the best. After reading the reviews it seemed this was a pretty solid choice. The whole concept of it, was everything I was looking for. However, I noticed a couple days after setting it up, that it leaks like crazy (usually leaves a stream on my floor) and its loud. Like really loud. I'm kinda dissapointed. Ive been thinking about just exchanging it, maybe this one is malfuction, but so far not impressed."
2,dirty and noisy...,"My cat loves to drink from this fountain and uses it more than she would a regular bowl. I introduced it to her at 3 years old after using a bowl her whole life and it took a while for her to get use to, but she loves it now. The fountain worked great for a while....but after a couple of weeks it started becoming very noisy. This fountain is very picky. If any little thing is bothering it, it makes a tremendous amount of sound and it is a pain to figure out what exactly is bothering it. So this kind of defeats the purpose of it being a self-cleaning fountain. It also does not recycle the water very well. The water still gets very dirty and I see pieces all the time that don't go through the filter. I think the filter is actually cleaner than the actual water my cat drinks from when I go to change the filter every month. I wouldn't really recommend this product...After having it for about 3 months I need something more efficient..."
1,don't do it,I had this for less than three days. The first day it was great. I wish it gurgled more for the cat but it was fine. The last day I noticed that it seemed to be going through water quickly for one cat. Then I noticed the throw rug was saturated. Then i noticed the discoloration of the hardwood floors. Then i noticed the wet spot in the basement. I checked to see if the water container was screwed on correctly. Then i placed it on a dry towel on the kitchen counter. Within an hour the towel was saturated. Luckily I bought it at Walmart. Back it went but instead of putting it aside so that some other poor peeson would not be sold this piece of crap. They put it aside to be reshelved. I wish I could give this 0 stars.If this fails on you it could do major damage before you discover it.
1,Cleaning nightmare,"We purchased two (medium and large) for our 3 cats and small dog. I spend 30-45 minutes every weekend thoroughly cleaning the fountains. If you buy this product, plan on arming yourself with a small brush, Q-tips, and yes, even toothpicks to get into the small crevices to remove build-up gunk. Looks nice but poorly designed. I didn't realize how much cleaning the pump needed, even on the inside, and burned up the first pump within two weeks. I would not buy this product again. The only two good things I can say about it: they look nice and as soon as I clean them and put them down, the cats come running for fresh water."
1,We were fooled!,"Fooled into thinking this is the best product around.the product was intentionally designed with a flaw to destroy the moter and force one to buy a new one. (why else would the company sell the motors and offer them as soon as the item was produced). Any intelligent engineer would have designed the product to have the filter BEFORE the motor, insuring the motor stays clean as well as the output water. we have to clean out the moter every 6-8 weeks so that it doesn't burn out from being clogged from dust and cat hair. I hope they redesign it and when they do, I will then write another review."
2,"Disposable pump, grows slime","When this fountain is freshly cleaned, the cats love it. The water does stay cool. But cat hair -- lots of THAT around here -- clogs the pump, and if the whole thing is not taken apart and completely cleaned with a toothbrush weekly, it grows slime. Eeeeuuuw. The first pump lasted about three months, then the replacement lasted about a month. Not really worth it, because the picky fussy cat would really rather drink from the toilet anyway."
2,"Hard To Clean, Gets Messy Easily","I've had this unit for over a year and while I like it better than a plain bowl of water, there are some flaws.The blue reservoir is growing algae in the corners and because of its shape, it's impossible to clean those spots. I also have hard water in my apartment, so the slide gets a lot of hardwater build up which doesn't come off with scrubbing. Finally, the thing is always getting clogged up with cat hair and weekly cleanings are necessary if you don't want your cat drinking gross hairy water.I will likely purchase the type of fountain that comes down like a faucet whenever this one breaks but I won't buy this one again."
1,disappointed,I also called the company and they said they could not help me except to offer advice on filling and cleaning. I have been filling and cleaning the unit the same way for 18 months and all of a sudden it started to leak. The woman said that many units were sent back because of leaks and they couldn't get them to leak. Seems like there are a lot of us out there that CAN get them to leak.We can't all be wrong. I told the woman there are a lot of comments on amazon about the leaking units. My cats love the filter and I want to use it because my cat once had a UTI before I started using it. I just don't want to buy another one after only a year and a half. You would expect it to last longer.
4,A Bit Loud,"I bought this fountain to replace a smaller version that had worked without issue for several years before the pump motor finally gave out. This newer and larger incarnation has some improvements in the design (a filter basket over the flow opening in the bowl) and appears to filter and circulate the water effectively, but the water pump is noticeably louder than my previous version. It is not so loud that it poses an major issue for me, but, depending on its placement in the home, it could pose a nuisance for some people."
3,Loud water works scares cats,I wish my three cats liked this as much as I hoped they would. They won't go near it when it is running and hardly when it is not. I think I will need to convert back to the bowl. They are afraid of it because it really is loud. Sorry but that is the truth. I thought it would be great.
1,Defective one after the other,"My original lasted several years before it started leaking. I replaced it, and was dismayed that the new one began leaking about a week later. I replaced that one - thanks Amazon - and the new new one started leaking within 3 days.I'm not sure what is wrong with these, but the water appears to be seeping out of the bottom. Nothing has changed on my side.I'm going to have to return this one as well, and now change brands. What a waste of time."
2,My cat doesn't like this...,"I bought this about a year ago and our cat was never fond of it. If the water level goes down too much the motor gets loud which also scares the cat. I think it's because the water slides down the plastic slide, it doesn't pour like a true fountain. I find myself putting water bowls out around the house because our cat won't drink out of this water fountain. Anyway, for what it's worth, we're switching to the Drinkwell..."
5,petmate drink fountain - love it!,"I have 2 cats at home and have had a Petmate Deluxe Fresh Flow in the past, after problems with the pump i switched to the Drinkwell fountain. I did not like it as much - if you have it in a living area (mine was in the kitchen) it is very loud. Also the parts do not go back on as easy after you clean it. Recently, I switched back to the Petmate and am glad I did and think my cat is too! I do not think he was drinking as much from the Drinkwell due to how loud it was. On the Petmate, it seems like they have a new manufacturer for the pump since I owned it last - it is not noisy at all, and so far is easy to clean. I bought the medium size, which is smaller than i owed last time, but only one of my cats uses it, so it seems to be fine."
2,"Works fine, not as quiet as it should be","The water flow is good, but the machine is not as quiet as it claims to be. I have tried multiple home remedies to minimize the motor noise. The manufacturer's claim of no noise and to simply push the suction cups down more doesn't work. I bought two and they both have this issue. The cats got used to it within a couple days and it's a non-issue for them."
3,Petmate Fountain,"Only complaint was that it was noisy. Amazon replaced the unit and all is now good. Not whisper quiet as it says on the box but you get used to the background hum. One of my cats loves it, the other is not so sure"
1,Petmate; Fresh Flow Cat Fountain (50 oz. capacity,"Worked well for the first 3 weeks or so, then the pump stopped pumping. Fountain stopped working. I do not recommend this product"
1,EH.,We have had this for over 6 months and we are cleaning it as constant as we did the manual water refill. We bought it for our cat but its constantly getting dirty. I dont think the filter works well at all. The film still gets around the bowl and his hair is in it as well. it does maintain filled pretty long but we bought this to clean out the junk he gets in it and its terrible. I am currently searching for a different one as we speak and figured id post about how much of a waste of money this system is. Trust me dont waste your time or money on this product.
3,Wrong item name,This is not the deluxe fountain as it it shown by the title. It's the smaller 50oz. I just got one to replace a deluxe and it's smaller than my old one. Misleading!
3,High Mainentaince Item,"This watering device is wonderful - until you have to clean it. At least every two weeks (more often in the summer) I have to dis-assemble the fountain to clean it. Rinsing the filter just doesn't cut it. It does come apart, even the motor assembly. However, there are so many inaccessible nooks and pockets that I have to scrub it with an old tooth brush (and bleach). Additionally, the underside is hollow creating a great place for insects and critters to live.It's just not worth the effort to keep this contraption clean. I recommend a conventional bowl."
1,Lead in Power Cord,"I've been using the Petmate Fresh Flow Water Fountain for years. I just purchased a new one to replace one that failed. Upon reading the safety instruction, I have become aware that the power cord contains lead. Quote: ""WARNING: the power cord of this appliance contains lead, a chemical known in the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects and other reproductive harm. Wash hands after handling.""Approximately 3 inches of this cord is immersed in the water that my cats would be drinking. Does this mean that humans should wash their hands of the responsibility not to put lead into their animals digestive system???? This product is made in China and I assume that is why the product does not meet health and safety regulations. What on earth is Petmate doing selling this product???I WON'T BE USING MY WATER FOUNTAIN AS MY CATS ARE MY LIFE AND SOLE. I WOULD NEVER KNOWINGLY HARM THEM OR PUT THEIR HEALTH AT RISK!!!"
1,Not satisfied,"I ordered the Espressop color and they shipped a white one. I decided to keep it anyway, however when I out it all together and them plugged it in the motor was a b it loud, and as the days past the motor became even louder, and yes I had water in it. The noise drove me nuts, so I called Target (becasue it was shipped from Target) to ask if I can return it at the store and they said yes. Even though I made it clear on the phone that I ordered it through Amazon, after being at the customer service desk at Target for 45 minutes the third manager who was called over finally knew what he was doing and said that I have to ship it back to Amazon! I will NEVER order something shipped from Target ever again, nor would I ever recommend this petmate system!"
2,Pump fails,"Great idea, lousy pump. Unlike the other reviewer who's experienced the pump failure, I refuse to buy a new heap of plastic every 6 months. Looks like it's hit or miss, since several reviewers have not complained of pump failure, but I'll wait for a better pump before buying another."
4,Cat loves it.,"I first tried the Drinkwell unit but they are so noisy neither the cat nor I would go near it. This fountain is whisper quiet and provides enough water to be able to be away for a few days without worry. Cat loves it, end of story."
3,fountain,"it was ok for what it could do, except that you have to keep filling the 50 ounce water container if there is no water missing from the main water dish."
3,"I think it's a great idea, but my cats are scared of it.","The sound of the water pump seems to scare the cats, but it functions as it should."
3,Great concept,"Well, this is my second Petmate and this one leaks. This is the only way to get my cat and kitten to regularly drink water. They love the flow and watching the water come down the ramp.Perhaps, I just recvd a lemon"
1,Petmate Fresh Flow Cat Fountain,"This was a major disappointment. I don't know how they call it a ""fountain"" when all it does is drizzle out of a lame little hole. There is NOTHING ""flowing"" about it. Don't waste your time on this hunk of junk!"
1,I didn't think I had scardy cats . . .,After operating the Petmate Fresh Flow Cat Fountain for a month my 2 cats won't go anywhere near it. Very disappointing!!
1,Fresh flow fountain -- Worked well for a couple of days....,then it got really loud and within 2 weeks stopped working altogether. I haven't had time to return it.
5,Empty Holster,"If this is a first novel, I can hardly wait to see those coming behind. A very good read, could not put it down. Sounds like a movie in the making to me."
5,Back To The Good Ol' Days,Empty holster takes you back to a time of the real cowboy and American hero. It shows the reader exactly what it was like to live in an era of rough and rugged times. Whistler captures the imagination of the reader while leaving you wanting to know more about his life's journey. There is nothing empty about this book as it will make you long for the good ol' days when cowboys were always heroes.
5,The Old West lives on,This is a good story of the Old West. You can't help but like the main character who is known as Whistler. He's a big man with a big heart but don't mess with his family or you'll pay a price. Lots of action and just a little romance and humor.
4,Great 1st Book,"he book is ""Golden Age"" meets Hopalong Cassidy. There is a distinct knowledge of who is a good guy and who is a bad guy, yet Whistler's flaws come out occasionally. He is a veteran of the War Between the States and a former lawman and a former cattle drover, yet that is all you are shown of his background. Whistler himself, doesn't recall most of the war.The scene that follows the above opening, Whistler is ambushed. All he sees of his assailants is a large white horse. His horse and guns are stolen and he is left for dead. He is found by his long lost sister and taken in for recovery.Although the description of his renewing his relationship with his sister and becoming acquainted with her husband and two children, Temperance, whom he calls his angel, and Little John, is artfully done, there could have been a bit more detail of his recuperation...."
4,Decent,The phone is decent but seems to have been out of production when I purchased it and the batteries were DOA. The seller quickly responded to my email and offered a full refund if I returned the product but was unable to replace the batteries. I didn't want to return it though so I easily found the batteries cheap on ebay. The phone itself works great in all aspects but has a slight interference in the call quality. It's barely noticeable but I think (not sure) that it might be caused but another phone set I have in the house with a slightly different frequency.
3,At The Drive-In Deserve Better Than This,"Review by Tyler Wagnon:There can never be enough praise given to At the Drive-In. They were probably the most influential indie band since... I don't know maybe The Pixies or Pavement.With that being said, this collection/greatest hits is completely inadequate. It is basically a few tracks from each release, a couple rare tracks, and a DVD with music videos. It's an insult to ATDI's legacy if you ask me. However, trying to sum up their career in 18 tracks would be basically impossible unless it were a complete discography.At the Drive-In is an amazing band and deserve to be in every music fan's collection, but please buy the albums instead because each track is indispensable. Sorry Fearless, you can't just release some half-a$$ collection with ATDI's name on it and expect it to be worth anything."
3,Not Quite as Expected,It was advertised as good condition but it was dirty and dog eared. Still it is readable and after all condition is subjective.
4,Just read first book so far,"I like the first book and am looking forward to the second. Easy read, informative on scripture, makes learning about the rapture interesting. So although fictional, it is a means to demonstrate biblical predictions."
5,Page turner,"Read ""Left Behind"" first. It had such a surprise ending that I had to order the whole series! Enjoying the 2nd book now :)"
5,Very Pleased,"I have always been very happy with Amazon.com. My recent purchase of the boxed volume set 1-5 from the series ""Left Behind"" arrived in pristine condition! I was delighted! The box within the box was carefully wrapped in plastic, and the items were delivered right on time. The price was very reasonable too...thank you Amazon.com! I'll continue doing business with you..:-)"
4,Left behind books 1-5,All books in very good shape - quick mailing service was appreciated. Will purchase from amazon again in the future! Thank you.
1,Not Happy At ALL!!!,"I placed this order well before Christmas - 12/11 - which supposedly guaranteed shipment prior to 12/24. The order showed shipped in the system within in a couple days. However it did NOT arrive until 12/29!!! This was a gift for my young nephew. In addition, the order I placed was for NEW/Unused! When it arrived you can tell that it was NOT new. The outside box that holds the books was all nicked up and weathered. Plus the books were definitely read and put back in the case. Extremely disappointed and would strongly discourage anyone from ordering through this source again. Not to mention I paid $80 for a gift that arrived AFTER the holidays and was used."
1,A defintion of Christian,"This series is a must-read for sanctimonious, up-tight , moralististic, holier-than-thou types who are so insecure in their own beliefs that they must foist it upon others; lacking that, they need such cabalistic, inane rattletrap as ""Left Behind"" to smugly assure those who do not not believe as they do (or as properly as they do), what their dire fates will be. Beleive as I do, or you will be left behind; (or we will bomb your tallest buildings, you white infidels). True beleivers do not feel the need to hanrangue, berate, belittle. WWJD? Not this series. Buy another much bigger best-seller- the Bible"
5,Left Behind Review Books 1 - 5,"These books are awesome! Once you get started reading them, you won't want to put them down. Action packed and full of the word of God. Am glad I ordered them as a set and not one by one."
4,:),"The book set was great! It came the way it was described, i would have given a 5 star but on the description they didn't say box wasn't included until after i ordered it and then they told me that it wasn't included but it doesn't really matter b/c i don't need the box anyways :)"
4,Books of choice,I was pleased with communication in selection of the product and with the quality that was described was as received. Would order again.
1,Best part of Left Behind,The best part of left behind was when I walked away from the trash can leaving behind these books.Honestly I could not in clear conscience sell or even give these books away.
5,Book of Revelations come alive,"The lefty behind set of books is some of the most exciting and enjoyable books I have ever read. As a very slow reader because I'm very dyslexic, I find my self just glued to the books and can not put them down. The series is fiction but so credible and the authors keep you interested throughout the book with many twist and turns."
1,completely misleading and false,"I would give these books zero stars if I could. These books have no real biblical or theological substance or foundation. I loved them 12 years ago when I read them because yes - they are exciting, and I was a naive 14 year old who did not have any biblical education. But then I went to college where I studied the Bible, and now I am in seminary studying theology and the Bible - and I realize how silly and misleading these books are. Sure go ahead and read them if you can accept them for what they are: fiction. But please don't take these books as biblical truth. If you want a good account for what Christian hope should be, N.T Wright (an actual theologian), has a great book called ""Surprised By Hope."" Or you could read ""The Rapture Exposed"" by Barbara Rossing."
5,"Left Behind Series, Vol 1-5 Box set","This was the most enlightening experience of the Erath's last days ever! I was thrilled I had 5 of them to read, which gave me time to order the rest!Which I immediately did! Your prices were the best I could find. If I had not already been a follower of Christ for many years, I would have gladly spoken the words, so plentifully given in so many places to become one! Great Great series! Nothing boring in any of them!!!"
4,Great books!,I received these books before the starting date so I could go ahead & read these right away. The books were in great shape also.
5,Great,I remember listening I Hear You Knocking on the car radio when I was in high school. Thought it was a great song and still do. Another gem on my ipod!
3,Rockpile,"Not his best work for sure, all the good stuff on it is also on ""Small things"" which is excellent and a better buy."
1,Bad Condition,"I expected to receive a better product, instead I received a product with damage which is not safe for the purpose I intended for. They should revise the goods before delivering to the customers."
3,Handle is Wobbly,"I would say this mug is worth the ten dollars I paid for it, but not much more. It keeps my coffee hot for at least three hours and doesn't give it an off-taste, two features that are more important to me than design. However, the handle is very wobbly and I don't know how long it will last. One tip is to never ever grab the handle for leverage while screwing the lid off; this is a stupid idea for any travel mug with a handle, but especially for this one. The lid is just fine for me; it doesn't leak and the hole is neither too big nor too small."
4,Good Mug without any Leak Problem,"For $3.99, any complain? Not at all... This is very well made stainless-steal mug. I never have any leak problem so far. It hold hot coffee/tea over 1.5 hours or more..."
4,great design. no leak problem so far,"I have read many reviewers complaining issues about this product, but mine has none at all so far. The lid takes some time to get used to it, as the angle might be awkward to screw the lid tight, at the right position (depending on whether you're right-hander or left-hander), but once it's all set, it does not leak, at least so far, and get the job done nicely. One drawback, if you want to call it, is the design of the drinking/sipping outlet. It's very small, the liquid comes out slowly. If you want to gulp down hot coffee certainly you need to remove the lid. But I think it's more of a safety design, to prevent liquid from leaking over your mouth, and from leaking due to constant rumbling on the car.Overall, this is a good travel mug if you can grab it at deep discount price (I got one at around $4). Cheers."
2,Not Good,"The worst part of this mug to me is the fact that the hole in the lid, from which you drink, can't be closed. It's just a hole in the top that cannot be adjusted or closed. This is a particular concern to me because I don't want my coffee to loose heat or, worse, spill while driving. The materials used arn't bad, but the construction and design is. The handle seems loose or flemsy. I bought this mug because it was being sold for four dollars with a regular price of twenty-five. It is absolutely absurd to suggest that this mug is anywhere close to being worth 25! Honestly, I probably wouldn't pay four if I had it to do over again."
2,"Nice design, flawed execution.","I anxiously awaited this mug, which was backordered for about 2 months after I ordered it. It fits in my car's cupholder, which was my primary reason for ordering it, and it is stainless steel, which resists stains and odors much better than my plastic coffee mugs. However, the handle attachment is weak, and looks like it would be impossible to repair (though I did not test this). Worse, however, was the top, which leaked coffee all over me every time I drank from it. It didn't matter how tight it was. This was surprising because they designed it with an o-ring in the lid that should have prevented any leakage.I've returned it and am looking for a replacement."
1,Do Not Buy This Mug!,This is the worst coffee mug I have ever used. The lid does not fit properly and the coffee leaks all over you. The handle was so poorly conceived and cheaply attached that it came off the very first day I used it. Stay away from this one!
3,Handle with care!,"The cup was great until after three weeks at which time the weld broke off the handle which separated it from the cup body........a weak link I suspect. Maybe, better just to order the same Bodum SS travel mug without the attached handle, welded onto the cup body or take your chances it may stay attached! Even when the handle was attached to the cup body it is a, bothersome, loose fit."
2,Handle issues make this not worth buying,"This is a nice looking mug judging from the photo, and I ordered two at just over $4 each. On receipt I discovered that the handle is not well secured at the bottom. The part of the handle that wraps around the mug is a loose fit and is not tightly molded or glued. The effect is flimsy. In fact, my mugs look like a cheap knock-off of a ""real"" mug.My advice is: don't buy this, especially at the current price of over $17. Get the version with a grip (not a handle) selling for a bit over $4. I bought 2 of these as well, and at $4 and change each, they're a great deal, in fact I just ordered another 2.I'm going to keep my mugs, but only because I bought them with a gift certificate, and Amazon gives no refunds or exchanges on gift certs. Being a bit of a DIY-er I'm going to try to glue the handles at the bottom with marine-grade epoxy. I'm not sure that will stand up to the dish washer, but it's worth a shot..."
2,Not worth the price,This item is cheaply designed and built. The handle is loosley attached and the top leaks. The five dollar walmart special communter mugs are much better built. Do not buy!
1,"No vacuum in my mug, bad handles too","Purchased two of these mugs. The handles are weak and flimsy: you have to be careful not to hold on to the handle when removing the lid. I'm afraid they will break off with any force.But the worst part is that one of the mugs has NO vacuum! It's obvious because, when you pour hot coffee in, the outside of the mug heats up quickly on ONE of the mugs, while the other mug stays cool. The main reason I bought this mug was for the vacuum: a vacuum mug keeps your beverage hot/cold about 10 times longer than a mug with no vacuum."
3,a little disspointed,"i was a little disappointed in this item, i expected a better quality. I guess the price was okay but I would not buy it again if given the chance"
5,Classic RBF,"I don't understand people who claim they liked the older RBF cds, but not this one. This CD reminds me a lot of Why do they rock so hard or Turn the radio off.Some are also complaining that they don't like how negative the songs are. Those people need to go back to the old songs they liked so much and listen again. For example Sell Out, Everything Sucks, I'll Never Be, The Kids Don't Like It, and Down In Flames. Classic RBF is the typical upbeat negative song.If you liked Turn The Radio Off or Why Do They Rock So Hard, you will love this CD. Very rarely do I enjoy a cd the first time I listen to it, but this one I did. If you like RBF, you WILL like this CD. I agree with Cheer Up not being their best work but this CD is MUCH better. I am really enjoying it."
3,meh,"I found this cd depressing, not in a way that the lyrics were, but i was hoping it would be like Turn the Radio Off and Why do they Rock so Hard? which were the albums that made me fall in love with Reel Big fish. those cds are musical geniuses. i was disappointed but I'm hoping it will grow on me"
1,ummm....,where's the ska? where's the punk? all i heard was a lot of trash! These guys used to be pretty decent (in the 90s) but they seem to have lost everything they ever once had. Dismal and disappointing
3,Hit or Miss,"Despite the fact that I am not the biggest Reel Big Fish fan, I do enjoy their music a lot and own three albums, not including this one. To be perfectly honest, it doesn't do a lot for me, but it's far from a bad album. What it comes down to is that the musical style is different than previous records and has less of a happy-go-lucky ska feel. It's a bit more bordered to rock with a lot of experimental stuff thrown in. Being a Social Distortion fan, I didn't find the ""Story of my Life"" cover good at all. Usually when a band covers a song, they should strive to make it better than the original. Although that's not the case most times, when it happens it's awesome. The other covers on here are okay, but I suppose you have to look at it as them putting their own spin on those songs. Overall an okay album, but I'd recommend ""Why.."" and ""Radio"" waaaay before this one."
5,To all you SKA haters go to hell!!!,"In context, this album freaking rocks compared to their last album. They haven't forgot their roots like Goldfinger, and No Doubt, they just play SKA the way it used to be. The world can move on and listen to their poppy punk crap, but I'm sticking back to the 80's Rude Boy style! If your are not corrupted by the system (MTV) If your ears aren't gushing out blood from the crap that you hear on the radio, PLEASE pick up this album and go and SKANK to the beat at their concerts, you do remember what it's like to have fun at concerts don't you!"
3,I'm not too sure.,"When i first got this album i was pissed off.The sound quality was odd, The vocals sounded weird and it wasn't the Reel big fish i remembered.It was more of a Ska album than Cheer up which i'm VERY happy about.I think i'd be more pleased with the cd if it weren't Reel big Fish.Overall it's an ok album. It's an adjusment.Doesn't it seem they always want the opposite of what they have?First they were mad about not being famous, Then they got famous and they wrote songs about not liking that, and now they are mad they aren't getting credit."
3,Somewhat Dissapointed,"I couldn't wait until this album came out. I was so impressed with Cheer Up that I thought that this could be even better. But to be honest, I was a little dissapointed with the cd. There are some highlights, like ""The Fire"", ""Don't Start A Band"", and ""Say Goodbye"". But some of the tracks just were not fun to listen to, like ""Revolution"" and ""The Bad Guy"". I was taken aback by some of the depressing song titles, and the lyrics were very sad and angry. I still like Reel Big Fish a great deal, but I wish that this disc was a little better."
1,RBF is just going through the motions,"I've been a big fan of Reel Big Fish for a few years now. I enjoyed everything up to this record (including Cheer Up!, which I guess makes me one of the few), and this one has about three songs I genuinely listen to over and over again. It's more of the cynical/angry lyrics that really don't entertain me at all.If RBF hates being a band as much as they say, then perhaps they should end it now. If they release more stuff of this caliber, then it's just going to get worse."
5,Amazing Marcello,"Loved this movie. Although, the disk quality could be better, movie is funny, enchanting, full of true details and unpredictable. Gorgeous Marcello and beautiful Sandrelli!"
3,Classic Italian movie,This is an old classic Italian movie. Marcello Mastroiani and Stefania Sandrelli performance is not bad but I didn't like the movie in general. I've seen better ones
3,Marriage before Divorce,"Where is ""Marriage-Italian Style""? The Marcello Mastroianni/Sophia Loren team is more worthy of a dvd release than ""Divorce""."
5,One of a kind - wryly hilarious,"This is one of those classic 60's Italian films that marks a golden age, as well as defining Marcello Mastroianni as not merely talented but ingenious. It's a dry-witted look at degenerate old wealthy Italians by some very talented natives. Readers may wonder what's the big deal, why doesn't hubby just get a divorce? Divorce was not only immoral in Italy, it was illegal. The hilarity arises not only from Marcello's situation but from the lengths to which he's willing to go to achieve his goal, as well as the caricatures (are they really caricatures?) of the other characters. Marcello is brilliant here and so is the technical end. I gave a copy of this to my Italian parents and they called me long-distance, still laughing, to thank me for sending them this classic comedy. The sound track is a gem, too. This movie is a one-of-a-kind experience, so don't expect a usual low-level sitcom from this great film."
5,Book 'em Dano,"It's a Christmas present,but I know who I got it for will love it unless the disc are bad."
5,Hawaii Five-O: Sixth Season.,Hawaii Five-O has been a favorite of mine for many years and still continues to provide our family with excitment and entertainment.
5,Another great Hawaii Five-O season!,"Again, I have enjoyed the latest season in the Hawaii Five-O series. Naturally some episodes are better than others, but overall the key elements which make this series so great are still present - Jack Lord, his team, the soundtrack music and the beautiful scenery. Look forward to the next season!"
5,BRILLANT SERIES CONTINUES IN REISSUE 6,"I THOUGHT THAT SEASON 5 WAS BRILLIANT BUT SEASON 6 MAY EVEN BE BETTER. THE SERIES MAINTAINS IT'S INCREDIBLY HIGH STANDARDS WITH FASCINATING CHARACTERS, PLOTS, SCRIPTS, AND ON AND ON. THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST HAVE FOR ALL INTERESTED IN THE HISTORY OF THE TRULY GREAT SHOWS IN T.V. HISTORY. HIGHEST RATING AND HIGHEST PRAISE. I AM PRAYING THAT ALL OF THE SEASONS WILL BE RELEASED. IT WAS QUITE DEPRESSING TO PLAY THE LAST EPISODE OF SEASON SIX KNOWING THAT IT MIGHT VERY WELL BE THE LAST EPISODE I WILL EVER SEE. IF GOD IS WATCHING PLEASE SEND A MESSAGE TO THE POWERS THAT BE AND MOVE THEM TO ISSUE MORE OF THIS TOTALLY BRILLIANT SERIES."
1,Beware of Malware,I purchased this video and amazon downloaded a video program without warning that crashed my computer. Never saw the video and still working on virus removal.
1,VIDEO,NOT I SINGLE EPISODE PLAYED ALL THE WAY THROUGH. KEPT STOPPING AND I HAD TO RESTART CONSTANTLY. GOT THIS AS FREE TRIAL. I WOULD NEVER PAY FOR SUCH BAD SERVICE. NOT THE FIRST TIME I HAD TROUBLE VIEWING VIDEOS FROM AMAZON.
4,"Hookman, The Beginning","I titled the review ""the beginning,"" because the new version of Hawaii Five-0 reimagined this episode. Hookman is a man who is seeking revenge on some of Honolulu's finest. I dont' want to spoil the show for you, so I won't say why. It's very interesting to see the classic episode and compare it to the new one. CBS shared some photos on its website that were shots of the locations used in the show in 1973 alongside the same locations in 2013. They used a bit of the same diaglog, too. In the original, the bad guy was an actual amputee; in the new one, it's Peter Weller. The old, hook style, prosthetic arms made the efforts of the villain seem almost heroic. If you watch them both, watch for the cars, the locations, the guns, the clothes, and the participation of the other characters.I have some problems with the quality of the new serires, but the old one still makes me smile and wait for the next ""Book 'im, Danno."" Yeah, I said it!"
5,Great,My wife is a Hawaii-Five-O fan. I purchased this to add to her library.Pro's: Excellent quality and priceCon's: NoneI would recommend to a friend
3,seasons get long,Never knew why Ben was released from the show in the revolving door of native Hawaiians on the show. The season was great though and watched every episode. Wish someone would tell me why the change in the main line up so much. Anyway it was enjoyable but does not stack up to the early years in my opion.
4,"Hawaii Five-O, Sixth Season","If you have purchased the first 5 seasons of Hawaii Five-O then this will continue to please. This does not contain my favorite episodes, but it is certainly what you would expect from this series."
3,System of A Downer,"I have not listened closely enough to this CD to make a solid judgement.Thank you and have a nice day.Praise ""Bob""-Agent Lloyd"
1,If I could choose less than 1 star I would,"System of a Down is the worst band that has ever existed, currently exists or will ever exist in the history of the world. How a no-talent collection of alt-metal posers can get a music contract is incomprehensible."
1,this band is high on sugar,system of a down on sugar is system of a high. This band is so odd i can't stand them.
2,I wish I was 15 again,"So,The theory is still true; if you aim low enough you will hit the mark when it comes to music. SOAD, as the middle schoolers like to call them, is seriously over rated. It's fairly easy to be ""totally awesome"" to a bunch of teenagers who are just now in their lives discovering cigarettes and coffee, so blowing them away is not a tough trick. I remember when I was in college and the Thompson Twins got the same kind of ""rave inspirational reviews"" from the kids...This thing too will pass, like a beer fart.One point to be clear on is, this CD is worth hearing for several reasons, none of which are covered in any of the teeny-bopper 5 star reviews. I'll leave it up to you."
2,"Not good, but not intolerable either.","I listened to most of this album. I heard ""Sugar"" and ""Spiders"" on the radio, first, and there just WASN'T anything catchy about this band. For one, the guitar riffs are boring. They only have one guitarist, but the sounds could have been easily made by an ampilifed rubberband if someone found a way to do that. Second, the lyricist (if that's what you call him) has the same voice on almost every song; it's that voice which is long overused in 90s Neo-Metal; the shivering, angry whining which was made famous by Korn and continues to be used to this day. I doubt that's what this band had in mind, but it's not really flattering. If I heard them live, I might give a higher rating, I don't know. To me this CD is not worth the time; it wasn't well-orchestrated and there didn't seem like there was a whole lot of effort put into it."
3,"Not system's best,but still awesome.","This cd is very good but in my opinion SOAD'S worst.1.sute-pee, good song,good,but confusing lyrics.catchy 7/102.know- not one of their best too fast of singing on serj's part.4/103.sugar-One of system of a downs best songs,my favorite song on this album. 10/104.suggestions-Very catchy lyrics good beats and cords9/105.spiders-Good song awesome lyrics,you never stop amazing me serj.10/106.DDevil-Not a good song,lyrics are a bit confusing.3/107.soil-Very good song for you METAL fAns!(evil lives in the ..skin)8.war?-Not a very good song. 2/109.mind-havent listened to it ?/?10.peephole-????11.CUBErt-?12.Darts-?P.L.U.C.K.-10/10I reccomend toxicity over this album"
2,Sounds familiar....,"I bought this album before I went to see them as an opener for fear factory. The album sucked. Simple guitar/bass work, standard drum work. Saw them in concert. Decent stage presence, but the music was uninspiring. Interesting vocal style. If you like music that sounds the same as Korn, Limp Bizquick, and the like, pick it up. If you're into anything else (metal or otherwise), stay away."
5,The best band i've ever heard!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Sytem of a down is by far the best band i've ever heard. Their sound is totally eclectic and so hardcore. The lead singer's voice is so kickin'! I saw them live about a week ago and it couldn't have been better. They're a great band to mosh to. Buy the cd. Trust me, you won't regret it!"
4,One of the better nu metal bands,I don't typically like nu metal bands because I really don't feel like all that beat'n rap'n scream'n is music but as for this cd. These guys pull of this wonderful energy and dynamic time signature change and they do this wierd high pitched-to-heavy thing where they play the riff really high and then shift the same notes over to heavy as hell axe work higher up on the neck. Its all definately worth a look even if they are besieged by teens and lumped in the same pile with stink'n park.
5,"not sellouts, but who cares, they're good.","a great metal band, and serj really sings awesome. different styles of singing. i like bands like korn and static-x. but this is much harder and agressive music. i reccomend this to any headbanger. fav. tracks are 1,2,and 3"
5,This is funny!,"Hey, I justlistened to these few tracks here at Amazon.com. These guys are funny! I mean, in a good way htough. I like it. I can't say much for the lyrics because I can't understand the vocalist that well, but I'm sure it's thought-provoking. Hey, well keep up the good work ""System of a Down."" Hey, if you like this group, you might like Snot from Santa Barbara (although I'm sorry Lynn passed away) or Salmon from Gilroy, CA. Word! --Kelly Magovern San Jose, CA"
4,Buy this before it's too late!,Buy this CD. They are such an awesome new band. This band will be one of the bigger bands in America soon. And you know what that means... they'll get crummy. So buy this CD and any other one you can because they won't be good for long!
5,Absolutely the BEST!,"This is simply one of the best hardcore albums ever. This group got me interested in the whole hard rock scene. Ever since i picked this album up 2 years ago, i couldn't get enough of them. The guitars on this album are great and the vocals are also equally excellent. Every song on here is awesome especially ""Sugar""(a personal favorite), ""War?"", and ""Spiders"". All in all this album is one of the best."
5,Alternative Tenticles,"I love this record... However, as the mooks say they have never heard anything that sounded like this before, I would like to turn on those who may not be familiar with the Alternative Tenticles label to check out both the Dead Kennedys and NoMeansNo (especially the WRONG album, from '89) which System very much brings to mind.That said, SYSTEM OF A DOWN turned my head around, and I cannot stop listening to it!"
5,My first system album,"Certainly the best album from system of a down, in my opinion. The song that really gets me is 'spiders' that song is just so beautiful and powerfully poetic, not something you'd expect from a metal band such as this."
5,........killer debut,"this is a great debut from this guys,the open track is simply killer...just as sugar darts and the whole album....you gotta get it.....this is one of the greatest metal albums of alll times definitely!!!!!!!!!!"
4,It Gets Me Going,"I think this tape is good. It sounds to me like it would be played at the Espn Extreme Games. This is because I think it could get the athletes going, and get them fired up."
5,system of a down rulz!!!!,"probably one of rocks best albums last year. S.O.A.D combines armenian folk beats with brutal korn-like metal, and fused it into a nuclei that destroys anythng in its path. Vocalist Serj Tankian is insane, his vocals go from a quiet whisper to schizophrenic madness. I have seen the band perform live and they have captured all of their charisma into the disk. Songs to look for on the disk are Sugar,War?, suggestions, Soil. and Ddevil, allthough all the songs are great these are some of the highlights. Even rarer songs like marmalade are good though hard to find. so if you wanna try a heavy band out or love metal, give system of a down a chance, im sure they will blow you away!!!!"
5,UNBELIEVABLE!!,"This is one of the greatest metal cd's i have heard in years. I didn't really know much about this band before but I heard they were good so I bought the CD. I couldn't believe how amazing it was!! It just keeps getting better every time. If your a metal fan, you must have this album."
3,lumpy spastic stuff,"mmmmmmmmm.....weight for weights' sake. Why not? Downtuned big slab geetarz and a vocalist who has a tenuous grip on sanity/reality (mushroom people?) Big metal fans will wallow in this, but if you're after a bit more feeling and subtlety, ""move along, there's nothing to see here..."""
3,"Pretty Good, Then Pretty Bad","Sugar and War. That's all you need. Then it would be a great album. Plus, they rock!"
5,SOAD's best,"This is my favorite SOAD album cuz it has my favorite song by them, PLUCK. Here's a song rating:1. Suite-Pee 5/52. Know 5/53. Sugar 5/54. Suggestions 5/55. Spiders 5/56. Ddevil 4/57. Soil 5/58. War? 5/59. Mind 4/510. Peephole 4/511. Cubert 4/512. Darts 5/513. P.L.U.C.K. 200/5Botoom line- SOAD's best CD."
5,INSPIRING,I MET SHAVO!!!!!!!Amazing band...... if rage against the machine met primus and turned the funk up 100% you get SOAD..... Absolutely breathtaking..... A great live show too! The pit was flying
5,One of the best albums ever!!!,"I thought that System's first album was really great. The lyrics were meaningful and powerful, the music very hard rock but melodic at the same time. There were only a few songs I didn't like, Soil, Suite Pee, and Mind. In these three songs, I thought that the use of the word f--k was completely random and unnecessary, they just said it to sound angry and full of testosterone, much like the average metal band. Other than that, they are very unique.While most hard rock bands scream for death and destruction, System of a Down believes in peace (anti-war..... you also hear that message in ""BOOM!"" their latest anti-war, anti-pres. bush single, on Steal this Album). There messages in their music are very powerful, and as for the actual quality of the music (guitar, vocals etc.) that's very good also. System of a Down is my favorite band, and I believe are quite revolutionary."
4,Great political rap-metal,SOAD's political lyrics and their play style meld fairly well but singer Serj Tankian's voice can get annoying. That is their only downside though. Each song comes off very well and doesn't sound like another song. Sugar and CUBErt are my favorites but each song has a certine value.
4,The Devil Is So Lovely,"System of a Down is maybe the best nu-metal band ever! This was their great debut and there's often discussion is this good or not. I think this needs time. You have to listen to it many times before you start to like it. The songs like ""Suite-Pee"", ""Know"", ""Sugar"", ""DDevil"", ""War?"", and ""P.L.U.C.K."" are the best songs to start. This is very aggressive album both musically and lyrically. The songs are quite short apart from the song ""Mind"". They last about 2-3 minurtes. The vocals are very good. The lyrics are mostly very aggressive but they good be better. I think the lyrics are great but could be better. There's very much political and religious message.Stars: War?, Suite-Pee, Sugar"
5,How it should sound,"Ok, So the clean version is not the best. After i go this I bought the explicit version and its better. Ddevil, Sugar, Suite-pee, War?. Some of my favorite songs are on this album. Serj Tankians lyrics, Daron Malakian on guitar, Shavo Odajian and the bass, and the amazing John Dalmayan on set. System of a Down represents everything that Metal should be today. If it weren't for them, theres no way I would listen to the radio at all. Armenian metal is by far the best idea in music today. BUY THIS ALBUM!!! NOW!!! STOP READING, JUST GO!!! WHY ARE YOU STILL READING THIS?!?!?!?!"
2,I Don't Get It,"The energy is there but they lack any musical dimension. When I first heard ""suggestions"" on the radio, I thought it was cool but that's about as good as the album gets. What you hear is what you get with this band. They need to stay home and practice (especially that annoying vocalist)then follow up with a more interesting second effort."
1,THIS BAND NEEDS HELP!!!!!,I SAW THEM AT OZZFEST AND LET ME TELL YA. THEY SUCK.THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW BAD OUR MILITARY SUCKS AND THE US SUCKS.COME ON.THIS IS THE BEST DAMN PLACE IN THE WORLD AND WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR YOUR SORRY MUSIC.TWO THUMBS DOWN.YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS BAND.
1,what a voice...,"I like the rhythm of their songs...heavy guitars...slamming drums...all except one....THE VOICE...oh please...the singer ruins everything. He needs to be more melodic, like Lajon Whiterspoon of Sevendust. Yes, the music's cool...but the singer needs more practice..."
1,soad is not metal,"It really makes me sick when people refer to system as metal(heavy,death,black, etc.) This band is in no way metal. All this bands songs are just random words with crappy guitar riffs and talentless drumming. Serj cannot sing in key or scream for his life(for really good harsh vocals see: opeth, dimmu borgir, emperor, dark tranquillity, etc.).I'd also like to say that bashing power chords randomly as fast as you can does not imply that the music you're making is heavy(slipknot is the biiggest committer of this crime). bands like this and slipknot and linkin park are to music what AIDS is to humans. the nu-metal genre is an insult to metal and an atrocity that should never have been committed."
1,"I listen to RATM, Korn, Limp Bizkit, and I still hate SOAD",I didn't actually buy the cd. I also never listened to any other song other than Sugar from it. But if that song was one of the better songs on the album and they made it into a single then whole thing has to be just as bad. When I first heard Sugar I fell out of my chair laughing at how bad it was. You people who gave this album a 4 1/2 star average can't be serious and if you are that's really pretty sad. Please don't encourage this horrible band to make another album. I really couldn't stand that.
1,Stay Away From This Garbage,"My friend and I have similar tastes in music (Staind, Static-X, Godsmack, etc.), so I was pretty happy when he reccommended this alum to me. To be frank, I couldn't even listen to the entire album--This isn't music; it's noise...Aggravating, disturbing, and infuriating noise...Stay away from this garbage. I gave it one star only bacaue I can't give it a zero."
2,Radio Songs Usually Aren't A Bands Best!,"Overall System Of A Down's self titled album is pretty much a failure, this album has the bands worst songs (which is strange because bands usually go downhill not uphill!) I am only giving this album two stars because there is some good sounding stuff when they are not scream (which is most of the album) as well as on the radio songs."
5,What is wrong with the youth of today?,"It bring tears to my eyes when I think about how little airplay the phenonimal music contained in this cd gets. I don't know where System of a Down came from, but I cannot effing wait to see where they go. I love this cd, and I hope that put out another cd A.S.A.F.P."
4,inventive,"a fantastic example of the how inventive and original metal can be, stands out from the crowd. `Suite Pee' would be my pick of the bunch, complete with its great intro."
5,Really Deep,"System of Down's talents are very obvious, but less obviuos is how deep their lyrics really are. I had to look up many key words, like in the song Darts, when they sing Arise again the Gods Ninti and Ishkur. Ninti turned out to be a Babylonian Goddess that was called lady of the rib LONG before Eve was written of in the Bible. And she was a healer and giver of life as opposed to Eve who receives life. I found this sort of thing all through the album. It focuses very much on the Goddess and pagan ways. The storming of poor June...Juno is the Roman version of Isis. If you read the lyrics for Suite-Pee you will see it saying...""Try HER philosphy"". It is an anti thesis to Christian domination which in War says ONE was written on the sword. Even if I am completely wrong, I learned a lot from looking this stuff up and all the same, the album rocks!!!!"
4,A great start,"There are very few bands out there who have the balls to say the political thigns that system of a down has, This was an amazing cd not my favorite SOAD cd but One of the best debut albums i have seen in a while, I enjoy there broad range of songs they have angry songs, politecial songs & some sad songs very few bands do that and its nice to know that there are still a few out there like SOAD. I say you should buy toxicity then there self tituled & them steal this album but thats just an opinion not a fact."
5,This album is just amazing!!!!!!!!!!!,This album just blows my mind you definantly get this one I am amazed at the way he can do the deep screaming thing and then turn his voice into a high pitch sound he has a true talent. Also the guitars are amazing too. AT ALL COSTS GET THIS ONE!!!!!
5,"Where is ""Temper?""","This is a must have for any rock/metal fan. System of a downrules! The best songs are ""sugar"", ""spiders"", and""War?"". I bought this C.D. because my cousin worked for them a while back and he gave me two demo tapes so I had to get this album. The only disappointment is that the song ""Temper"" that was on one of the demos didn't make the C.D. END"
5,Brand New Vision,"System of a Down are unfairly categorized with the nu-metal genre of music that seems to be popular these days. The reason it is so unfair, is because people fail to realize that these guys have innovated a sound that is theirs alone. You can immediately recognize any of their gems that happen to be on the radio as SOAD. There is never any question. I mean who else could have pulled off ""Sugar"" and kept it credible. The insanity and depth of the song would have falen apart on an average band, but with these guys the issues and humor are kept completely intact. Their sound is a wonderful cross between Frank Zappa and Slayer with all of the humor, musicianship, and politics that comes with it. All of the songs are hard-hitting, face smashing jams with outstanding vocals and musicianship. These guys are bound to become huge and largely influential in the years to come. I hear Toxicity is even better! I can't wait to get it. They have all of my respect and admiration."
4,Armenian rock???,"System of a Down's debut may - WILL - sound offbeat to people who find Tool normal...but after a few listens, System's sound grows on you. From the slow ballad ""Spiders"" to the faster ""Sugar"" and ""War?"", the entire album is an experience in music anyone looking for something new should try. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone looking for straight-forward metal, though."
5,Unique among uniques,"System of a down are the best band I have ever heard. Their style is the most unique. Korn and Rage against the machine have their own style, but system of a down is totally different from them. People who compare system of a down to Korn or Rage against the machine are totally wrong. I have heard Korn and Rage Against The Machine and I find very few things similar (such as the speed and the hard music). System of a Down are beautiful, comical and politically motivated, which makes them stand out from the croud full of lovers, and the ones who have lost their love. Go get their CD if you want to hear something different, something revolutionary."
5,The best band in music today,"Among all the sleazy MTV rock'n'roll wannabes, SOAD is simply a breath of fresh air... Listen to their music several times, and each time you will notice something new. The debut album is fantastic, I cannot wait until the next one comes out. The preview tracks like ""Chop Suey"", ""Arto"" and ""Innervision"" are very promising so far."
4,Mighty Impressive,"Wow! What an interesting CD! I have to strongly disagree with a previous reviewer, what impressed me so much about this disc is how much BETTER these guys are than the current crop of pretenders: static x, powerman 5000, etc. Brutally powerful and unique. The most interesting heavy music cd i've heard since the last Tool album. If you're disenchanted with the current state of heavy music(Limp Bizkit, et al), try System of A Down. I think you'll be very impressed!"
2,Review for extra material,"The 4 live tracks here are very poor. The guitar-playing is barely audible and the vocals are huffed and puffed. ""War"" was pretty good, but ""Sugar"" was truly awful. The other two were accessable. System Of A Down weren't a really good live band in 1999. Their studio music was very technical and hard to play live. However, on the Pleadge Of Allegence Tour around the time they dropped their sophomore album ""Toxcity"", their technical level dropped some, making thier live performances sound really good.There are some differences in the liner-notes, with different pictures. Just the lyrics sheet has not been moved.You might want to buy this for the ""Sugar"" video, but just be aware that there are many better live bands than SOAD.That's it, peace..."
4,Take it or leave it - the start of something wonderful,"The music that your parents hate, the music that has so much political substance and messages - just like their new one, but almost more so here. So, I picked up this album after ""Toxicity"" so I am kind of new to the band. Just listen to ""War"" Serj's explosive delivery to his lyrics really carry a lot of these tunes. No other band can do a songs like these. Other noteworthy songs ""Sugar"", and ""Spiders"" which features Serj without the explosive ranting, where you can see just how talented this band actually is. They do what they want, and they don't let steriotypes of what music should sound like bother them. A sign of a great band."
5,Superb metal CD,"This CD is good all the way through. The opening of Suite-Pee displays the guitarist's amazing talent, the initial drumbeat of Know is executed very skillfully, and the singer displays his very different, very cool voice throughout. Unlike most of the CD's I own, every song on this one is good. System of a Down manages to maintain great sounds in all 13 songs. I urge you to pick up this CD if you have any interest in metal. I'll definitely get their next CD."
3,I Was Scared Listening To This,"Man, are these guys angry, I mean, wow, they are really really angry. Angry. Really. Like really angry. Mad at the world type angry. Angry in like a rap metal type way. Sorta like Rage Against The Machine but maybe angrier. A N G R Y."
2,A Poor Start,"In the music industry most bands start out with a great first album and then sellout and fade away into the sun set. System of a Down has done the exact opposite - they have crafted two great albums (""Toxicity,"" ""Steal This Album"") focusing on politics and a mixture of controled rage and harmony. On the otherhand their first self titled album consists of just idle yelling and it is surprising that it sold well enough to warrant the classic ""Toxicity"" to be made. It has only two songs of note, Ddevil and Spiders. Ddevil's drum beat make it a caustic track along the lines of Bounce on Toxicity. Spiders on the other hand can't be compared to anything else, it is pure harmony.However the rest of the album is pure trash, including the hit Sugar. Not one other song sounds remotely intelligent or thought out in the way in which they are recorded.So don't bother with this unless you can't find Spiders and Ddevil on the internet - and go buy ""Toxicity"" and ""Steal This Album."""
2,The Truth about SOAD,"Ok i happen to find SOAD an ok band, simple easy guitar, good bass, good drumming, and the vocals arent too shabby either. I think Sugar is an ok kind of funny song, but all in all for my taste i think Spiders is the best song off of here, terriffic lyrics, and music all together. But i think the song shouldve been longer because of how dark and deep it was. All in all SOAD is ok and sound alot better then alot of these bands today. At least the guy actually sings. The thing is though, is that SOAD is not metal at all. Not even Nu Metal, there is not such a thing as nu metal, SOAD are just good old hard rock, and ill take it over the rap/rock mix anyday, so hardcore rockers enjoy the album."
5,This cd is a trip ! AWESOME! AWESOME! AWESOME!,"I first caught glimpse of this group during a short promo commerical when I was watching The Box Video channel. WOW! lead singer Serj Tankian vocal stylings blew my mind.There so original.He sounds like David Byrne on an acid trip who had a head on car crash with the London Opera House,and along with Earth Crisis and Pantera who got dragged along during the collision.In this age of too many alternative/pop love dovey bands around. This is an intelligence driven,politcally conscience band.We need more bands like these.If I want to scare my neighbors I put on this cd and here then moan in agony!END"
5,System of a Down stands for the message,System of a Down is great. it is a must have not only is the music hard hitting and pulsating with emotional rage the lyrics stand for something.Serj (the lead singer)spews out the harsh reality of this world full of genocide and hatred through extreme and deafening verses of hatred and anger. It is loud pulsatin guitar riffs mixed with a sort of primal Armenian chant (yes they are Armenian) I give a great roccomendation for this its not only a great listen but also a great lesson ALL HAIL SYSTEM OF A DOWN!!!!!!! LET US INVESTIGATE THE REVOLT!!!!DOWN WITH THE SYSTEM!!
4,Too short!,"System Of A Down debuts with a bang. There's no way to get tired of this album. I can't exactly give you highlights or weak points, because every single track is great. Unfortunately, they were lacking material and made way too short an album. They could use another 30 minutes, make it a 60 minute CD. Serj Tankian takes over the political struggles that Zack de la Rocha of Rage Against The Machine started, but Tankian is fighting against his own Middle Eastern governments. In P.L.U.C.K. he speaks out against the genocide of his people. From what I can tell, Suite-Pee is saying Jesus is a woman. But they are preaching Christianity, contrary to their government's Islamic heritage. They are rebels to the bone, and make damn good music."
5,The Very Best in Hard Rock!,"This band is what absolutely has to be the very best in hard rock. Just take one quick listen to ""Sugar"", ""Spiders"", or ""PLUCK"" and you'll know what I'm talking about. These guys are just soo crazy, and soooooo absolutely out of their minds that it gets scary sometimes (Sugar), but, yeah, definetly pick this up. Also, their new album will be coming out pretty soon, and you all need to pick that up. Just check out some of the new songs (""The Metro"", ""Marmalade"", and ""Shame (Wu Tang cover)"") that they've done off soundtrack albums and the such if ya don't believe me."
5,awesome!,"i bought this album simply for sugar but jeeze! every song here rocks, a lot are even better than sugar. this album does what we all want to do and that is give nu-metal a good kick in the balls! Long Live System of a Down!"
5,"i seen the new metal force , it is system of a down!!!!",These guys are asome!!!my best friend danny d song on stage with them for war!!!!!! i meet these guys in person!!!! if u dont hve the cd ur a moron.these are the most talented band since black sabbth!!!!!!!!
2,"""S.O.A.D. screams onto the metal scene""","This is not the best album I've heard in my life, but it's not S.O.A.D's worst album.(much better than the scraps on ""Steal This Album"") The upside is that it is easily recognized by S.O.A.D.'s style. Ithink that it was cool that this was the first band that successfully pulled of this style without sounding terrible. This album really shows how much System improves by the time they make ""Toxicity"". I think this album, like ""Steal This Album"", is mainly for people who are already fans of S.O.A.D, not a c.d. that you would let someone who has never heard of them listen to."
1,"wow, um, what can i say?","this is NOT heavy metal...this is NOT crazy...this is NOT talent...this is some kind of rock, and its very bad. why do people say the solos are crazy, or its heavy, fast, or complex? here you go: you want solos? listen to children of bodom, sinergy, onward...you want crazy listen to mr. bungle or fantomas...you want fast listen to slayer or soilwork...you want complex listen to spiral architect or death...you want heavy listen to deicide, morbid angel, cannibal corpse...basically, if you want some kind of heavy metal with talent or thought behind it...stay away from this, the 'anti-metal' man, americans really know nothing about music"
1,Talk About Overrated,"My god, there are soo many bands capable of doing what these guys do. Barely anything original in their playing (but the singer's outfits are cool). I could pull four guys out of any bar band across the globe and they'd be as good a band as these guys. Powerman 5000, Static X, Incubus, Sevendust, hell, even Slipknot and Stepkings blow these guys away, period. The album is seriously mediocre, as well. Recommend take two aspirins and get a Led Zeppelin record instead."
4,you buy it you buy it,This is a cool cd...the singer has a cool voice that I enjoy. This cd i find is mostly hard...the only really soft thing is Spiders. The song Sugar is hella sweet and you've probably heard it. There is a song called War on here....its so far my favorite song off the album. now you know that it rules and you must buy it now...bye bye
5,Amazing album,"This album is, in my opinion, System of a Down's best. It's very heavy, with poloitical protest lyrics. Most people refer to it as nu-metal, but it really sounds like hard rock. Best songs on it are Suite-pee, Know, and War?."
5,System just rocks,"I first heard Sugar on the radio, and loved it. Then I downloaded the Spiders mp3, and loved it. I got the cd, and it blew me away. The vocalist's voice is incredible, he can scream like the best of metal singers, and he can make his voice sound really funny too, and it works either way. Some of the songs are almost laughable, they sound like something out of a circus, but its a great new edge for metal music. There isn't one track that isn't as good as the rest. I can't wait for their next album!"
3,"So good you may ""Soil"" yourself.","I'm not their biggest fan, but this is a pretty good album. They mix the politics of ""Rage Against The Machine"", with a sound that's just as aggressive. The singer also has a unique style, and great range, where one moment he's a screaming maniac, and the next he sings a soft melody. Though it's not the best thing I've ever heard, if you're into the band at all, or the nu-metal scene, this debut of theirs is a must."
3,O.K. in my opinion,"System of a Down is defintely not a GREAT band and is obviously over-rated. The best song on the album is ""Sugar"" and the rest is O.K. material, nother super special. I totally understand if people hate this music and think it sucks."
5,They're by far are the best!,"Another reviewer didn't like the bones or the smokey flavor. If you don't like bones, you probably won't like many brands of sardines. I found the smokey taste just fine. I've tried many other brands and have found these to be my favorite."
1,Fishy Wishy stinky too,"I like sardines, really I do, just havent tried this brand before, thought I'd give it a try. won't be making that mistake ever again. The sardines were VERY small, lots of bones within them too, I guess some people would rather just eat the bones along with these fishies, but I don't like that. And the supposed ""smokey"" flavoring was very overwhelming, and I don't care for that much either. I just canceled my subcribtion to these nasty little things. In one word, ""ew"". I wouldnt serve them to my kitty if he were still with me. Better yet, I think I'll just dump the ones that're left, heck, if I were to package them and add them to a basket of food for the needy, I'd probably get it returned, these are just that nasty. DON'T BUY, looks little discolored goldfish in these tin cans. again, EWWW! (oh and VERY stinky.....)"
4,dawn of the dragon slayer,"i enjoyed watching this movie..the cast worked well together and the movie itself i would watch again, if you like dragon movies this wouldn't disappoint....."
1,Below average!,This movie had no real story to it. You have seen the same plot done several times. I found myself day dreaming at times and my mind wondering off while watching this movie... I never really got hooked. I think the girl did a pretty good job in the movie. The rest of the actors were mediocre. Watch at your own risk!
5,Simply...the BEST!,"This is a great collection and contains many gems not found on Captain & Tennille's ""Greatest Hits"". For example, there are many songs contained here that are from the late 1970s and early 1980s that were not released by the time ""Greatest Hits"" appeared. Songs include: ""Do That To Me One More Time"", ""Happy Together (A Fantasy)"", ""Love On A Shoestring"", ""Baby You Still Got It"", ""Keepin' Our Love Warm"", and ""Until You Come Back To Me."" Do not miss out on this collection; you will not be disappointed. Captain & Tennille fans will find near perfection and ecstasy in this disc."
1,TERRIBLE,oh man this book was worthless. I tried the stuff in this book and now my kids hate me and my wife thinks I'm an idiot. Try another book. This one has ruined my family life.
5,fabulous,"This guy blew me away with his ""down home"" style of playing. He's funky & raunchy & just plain moves those keys. Most jazz organists start off a song lightly and then ""gets down"" later into the song, but not Winston Walls. He'll count off 1-2-3-4 and just blows your socks off right away. Also on this album is jazz organist Jack McDuff. They have a battle of the organs on a few song, taking licks back & forth. This is ""live"" recording with super sound quality. Winston Walls also sing a few blues tunes nicely. I loved every track on this CD. I must to own for all you jazz organ lovers!"
5,Loved it!! Yummy Dishes!!,I got this book for my brother in law and Boyfriend - For Christmas this past year.They loved it! I've had a few dishes they've made and are Delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Surprisingly disappointed for fictionalized Roman History.,"I am fascinated by the period of Roman history from 133 B.C.E. through 68 C.E. and generally like any works of fiction or non-fiction set during this time period.However, I was surprisingly disappointed by this novel.Perhaps because Harris chose Cicero's slave/secretary Tiro as the narrator of the story, thereby depriving himself of the opportunity to create interesting secondary stories and characters, the book comes across as a very dry account of Cicero's early political career.I believe a reader would be better served by reading one of the biographies of Cicero that have been published during the last decade. Certainly, the interested reader would learn more about the political conflicts that are the background of the novel and just as much about Cicero and the other main characters referenced in the novel."
3,Good Historical Fiction,"I thought this historical novel was very accurate and interesting. I didn't know a lot about Marcus Cicero other than what the little bit the history books had mentioned. It was told from the point of view of Cicero's slave, Tiro. He was Cicero's secretary that developed a form of shorthand and took down all of Cicero's meeting, briefs and speeches. This book is the first of a trilogy and it is just the rise of Cicero to the consul. It shows the inner workings and political deals that went on even back in the Roman days. I felt at times like the book dragged on and on. It got tiresome in the middle. I also didn't know it was the first in the series. I would recommend it to anyone looking for more on Cicero, but realize that it's fiction."
4,Fun political thriller,"I enjoy political and legal thrillers. I'm usually not a historical fiction fan, so I was wary when this was recommended. But Cicero was a politician and a lawyer, and if this book is true, not much has changed in either field."
2,Imperium: A Novel of Ancient Rome,"I was looking forward to reading this book, but I didn't find it interesting. I felt too much time was spent on unimportant details. I do not think that the author made the characters come to life. Rosie"
3,Just OK,Great if you are a history buff.Not so great if you are expecting a political or legal thriller.The plot lacks excitement.After reading some of these reviews I was expecting a lot more.
3,A change of style,"Harris's latest book is like a weak partial biography of Cicero, unlike his previous strong plot driven novels. It's ends rather abruptly too. Neither fish nor fowl."
2,Quick comparison of his books,"Hello,This book has a unique setting but didn't interest me beyond the first few chapters. Harris's book on Pompeii was much more interesting to me. It had a lot of information about the culture and the technology of the Romans that was new and riviting.Regards, Marti B"
4,A Beautiful picture of Antique Rome,"Reading this book, you feel all the people you read about in History Books being resurrected, standing in front of you in flesh and blood."
5,Imperium,"Robert Harris makes ancient Rome really come alive. His characters appear so real, and times seem so hard, and contrasting"
2,Less Thrilling Than I Anticipated,"I liked the historical aspect of this tale and I loved that it was told by Cicero's slave. I didn't love the political wrangling. I find politics dull, no matter who the players happen to be. Even when there is ample wheeling, dealing, and maneuvering- it's dullsville for me. I made it through this one but am sorry that I already bought the second one in the pair."
2,Didn't Finish,"I was stoked about this book. It started off okay, but I got bored and put it down for something more interesting... Big Bang by Simon Singh."
3,interesting but not gripping,"I liked this book but didn't love it. I enjoy historical novels and love legal thrillers, and so maybe my expectations were too high. I found the story and all the details of life in ancient Rome interesting, but somehow, the characters and the times never quite came alive to me. I'm certainly glad that I read this, and if you have an interest in ancient Rome, this is a novel you certainly want to read. If you are not already invested in the era, or if you are looking for a riveting page turner (only parts were), then I'm not sure this is something I'd recommend."
2,verbose,"My husband and I tried to do this as a shared read-aloud book. We managed to get through 30% of the book but finally decided it was endless. Although the central character tends toward verbosity, does the author need to do the same? But, alas, we are old and time is short. Our reading choices need to be really engaging or we will toss them off and find something else."
2,hard slogging,"I enjoyed pompeii, but I am finding this one hard slogging. The story seems to be a straight narration of political events from one viewpoint, the slave Tiro, and there's very little personal interaction, very little that makes you like or identify with any of the characters, or even hate cicero's nemesis. I got about half way through it and realized it was never going to pick up or make me care about the characters, one way or another and skimmed the rest."
4,Spectacular,"""Imperium"" is brilliant. Robert Harris produces a historical novel that zips through with high intensity while maintaining steady grip on reality. Its amazing the tension Harris builds during the political events in the novel. Normally such events are not the stuff of thrillers, but not so here. Also wonderful are the characterizations, especially Cicero himself. Another favorite for me is Julius Ceasar who enters the novel early in his career. The ""insider perspective"" the reader gets into how Ceasar begins to win space in Roman politics and into the character traits that lead to his future importance is a special treat. I definitely am looking forward to a continuation of this Cicero's saga"
5,great fun to read,"Imperium the latest book of Robert Harris is a great book if you would like to immerse yourself in the world of the last years of republican Rome.It is a book that has some chapters that parallel what is going on in our post 9/11 world.I loved every word in this book and are hoping for a sequel by Mr Harris.It is a better book than Pompeii,the characters are definitely better developed.Its a great book."
4,cicereo comes alive,"I think this is an excellent book. If you like Roman History, this novel makes the characters come alive. Cicero is one of the influential persons of his time.. He is as real in this book as any I have read.. Recommend it."
4,Witness History unraverling before your eyes,"As historical novels go, this novel is superb. I love the portrait of Cicero and his familar life, the life in Rome, the slow developing of Roman Republic's tragedy. You feel full of foreboding, even you see Cicero struggling with the procedural entrapments, the subtle intrigues of politics, the blatant lies of those high in power. It's the portrait of an intriguing man sa well of a crucial era in world's history, an era that strangely echoes our own. There are some curious flaws, though: a Roman in a court would swear to Minerva, Justice's Goddess, or to the Justitia, certainly not to ""God"". IMO Roman religion feels a bit neglected, yet it was an important part of a Roman's everyday life, even of a cultured and relatively skeptic man as Cicero was. Yet this novel is certainly worth reading for its skillful characterizations and its brilliant rendition of historical events."
4,Could not put the book down once I started reading,"Kept reading because I did not know what was going to happen next and the author made me care. Even though I did not know what to expect, the characters seem well motivated.However, don't read this book if you are already stressed out. There is much anger in this book and most of the characters seem justifiably disoriented. It is sad.I agree with the criticism of the reader from Seattle who said that most whites don't think about Native Americans, where Sherman Alexie depicts whites as loving or hating Natives. Yet I was aware of Native anger when I lived in the Pacific Northwest because they destroyed an oyster bed near where I lived. Still none of us felt very emotional about it. Maybe we have been numbed by several hundred years of conflict."
3,Forget Them!!!,"Regardless of whatever anyone says I enjoyed this book from start to finish, as is the case with much of his other work. What worked for me was his ability to effectively use his culture in conjuction with contemporary societial views (i.e. Urban Indians, 'Apples', etc). As a Native American I could relate with Sherman on some points, and found some of his views suprising and interesting at times. Keep up the good work and congratulations on your victory at the Poetry championships in Taos, NM. Heidi (Dine/Hawaiian)"
4,Anger and Hate,"I found Indian Killer to be a very well-written book, but very trying to read. It flowed as well as any race hate novel can flow. Alexie is obviously a very angry man who has chosen to share his feelings through writing. By the end of the book, I felt beaten to death by all of the violence and hate that was thrown at me. The characters became old after awhile. I kept waiting for them to snap out of their ""hate all beat all"" moods. They never did. Overall, I though the book was very good with a great plot."
1,Abysmal,"The reviews all seem to be either wildly positive or negative. I'm in the latter group. I thought this book was so shot through with hate and self-pity that it was painful to read, and the white characters were all cardboard stereotypes. It's a pity, since the author is obviously deeply familiar with northwestern Indian life and could have written a fascinating, mind-opening book instead of this mess."
4,natives in the city,I loved this book. It was very good. The main characters were very unique and had alot of very serious life experiences. It describes very well the way an Indian in the city might view things or understand them. I recommend this book to anybody who likes sherman's work.
3,The Lost Americans,"The problem with Indian Killer is that Sherman Alexie has lost his voice--hopefully only temporarily. Some passages of Indian Killer still bear the defter strokes of his imagination, but he largely has abandoned his former lyrical voice for this new hack, suspense/thriller writer's voice. He certainly includes some colorful elements: the Seattle setting, diverse characters who are Indian, black, and white. He shows intelligence in describing the complexity of the situation, in show that pain knows no ethnic boundaries. But eventually Alexie becomes too bogged down in plot, sacrificing sparkling poetry for stodgy prose.Still Alexie fills a frightful void: he succeeds in reminding us again of the lost Americans, the Native Americans. Through his writing, he asks how must it feel to grow up in a country that belonged to one's ancestors for centuries, yet to still feel like a foreigner, a trespasser, a stranger in a stranger land."
4,It'll keep you guessing...,"The Indian Killer has two sub-stories within one book. The main story is about a criminally insane man that is going around Seattle committing murders. The other is a story about how an Indian boy who was adopted by a white family and has to deal with the fact that he will never know his racial heritage or where he comes from. This is an exiting book, from page one it catches your attention and keeps you interested till the last page. The plot is filled with twists and turns and it will keep you guessing till the last chapter. I must say that the ending is a little dull, but the book is filled with surprises and I guarantee that you won't be able to put it down. Another interesting thing about Indian Killer is that every chapter is about a different character. There aren't two chapters in a row that are about the same character. I would like to close by saying that Indian Killer was one of the greatest books that I have ever read."
2,Robert Redford writes a novel,"After all the good reviews of this book, I was horribly disappointed. Indeed, half way thru I finally gave up. Why? Because I found the characters like two dimensional cut-outs of people, thin and pre-determined by their creator as good, bad, phony, laudible. I hate this kind of writing. It is like one of the bad Refdford movies in which all characters are little icons of his view of the world, politically correct or the reverse. Characters are complex, and the best do not need to be pre-judged. I'm sorry, but I will have to be hard put to try another of this author's books. There is too much good literature, and even good pulp fiction out there to be led around like in this one."
3,On the warpath,"I had not heard of this author and I picked this book up mainly because of the Seattle connection and of course all the places mentioned in the story were familiar.Other readers have put it more eloquently than I can, but the book does make you stop and think.It points out how frightened and insecure people became in their comfortable worlds when strange killings began happening.I agree with one of the reviewers on who the Killer was. I liked Marie and she was more correct in her opinions than her professor.The only thing I can say for sure was that John flew, and 2 people wrote books on what they felt they knew about him.As for being a good portrayal of modern Indian Culture, I don't believe it is. As for the casinos on Indian Land, don't go there hoping to see Indians cause what you will find are the same addicted gamblers you would find anywhere.Not sure if I would recommend this book or not, but it does make you think, if you can hang in there and get through all the details."
4,Its Okay,This is a good book and i would recomend it to someone with a short atention span. This book will wrap you up and you will not wantto put it down. The auther did a very good job with introduceing new people into the story. this is a mystery that will will keep you guessing untill the end. it is about the murders of white men you are being scalped and left for dead. this sends the city of seattle into an uproar acussing every person with an idian backgrond of being the murderer.
5,A Great movie with tons of action,I can't believe i missed this one when it was on because i am a huge fan of Chuck Norris and this is without a doubt in his top 10 movies! It is a thrill ride with lots and lots of awesome martial arts sequences.Chuck needs to come back because this movie is one to get if you like action and alot of it! I also the like that even though Chuck is looking for his replacement in the film he ends up doing alot of the fighting himself.
5,YOUR FRIENDS WILL BE SO JEALOUS!,"I HAVE USED SWEDISH CHOCOLATE FOR ABOUT FOUR YEARS NOW...FIRST TURNED ON TO IT AT A TANNING SALON IN NEWPORT, RI...THEY CHARGED $55 PER BOTTLE.

SMELLS GREAT - NOT GREASY - THE BEST EVER!"
2,Don't buy the N73,This phone will not recognize a MicroSD card larger than 2GB. I have updated to the latest firmware and software and this phone is still glitchy. All of the adapters are proprietary. I bought this phone to listen to MP3s and its really not good for that. I paid $300 and I would say its worth $30. All i can do with it is make phone calls and send text messages. This phone is not a step up.
5,Love this Phone,"Just received it this week. Replacing my Nokia N90 with this model, the photos are much better (both have optical Carl Zeiss lenses, but this is 3.2 mp vs. 2.0 on the N90). Also, the N73 covers all radio bands, making the reception on my Cingular coverage very very strong everywhere (supposedly two internal antennae). The N90 lacked one of the frequency ranges used by Cingular, so depending on the city I was in, I occasionally had very spotty coverage. The Symbian operating system in the N73 is faster than the older version on the N90, and best of all, it is much more compact than the N90, fits nicely in the palm of my hand and in my jeans pocket. Last, there is a very smooth operating lense cover on the back of the phone, protecting the camera lense (why aren't they all like this?). As usual, the flash isn't the equivalent of even a moderate digital camera, but otherwise I see this phone as the best of both worlds."
4,Excellent phone but N80 is better for close price,"For $10 more, upgrade to an N80 w/ uPNP, video calling, WiFi, bar code reader, MS Word, Excel, PowerPoint, PDF, Safari browser, higher resolution screen"
4,beautiful phone,beautiful phone with a great camera and easy to use web browser. i was really impressed by the sound quality. just note that you can get it for cheaper at [...] (or elsewhere).
3,price/quality > 1,Positives:Great screen display (its best feature for which I have bought it)Intuitive and easily customizable software applications (when functional - see below)Clear audio sound and great/loud speaker systemVery compact and good looking overallDecent battery lifeNegatives:Keypad could be biggerCamera (for which you pay a high price premium) adds years to faces (but is ok on still objects); there's a delay in image capturing (i.e. what you see captured may not end up being what ultimately gets saved as your photo)Software glitches (i.e. attempting to set up the alarm clock would trigger a system error - problem fixed after performing a factory settings reset)Weaker signal capturing abilities than my old Nokia
3,Faulty Charger,"The phone works perfectly, however, after approximately 3 charges, the charger stopped working. Had to go out and buy a replacement for $30."
4,Excellent phone,"The phone works great, had no problems up to now, very impressed with its capabilities. The picture quality is perfect for printouts, the user interface is easy to work.Music player and MiniSD slot gives you good quantity of memory for all your fav tunes. Not a fan of the D-pad because I have big fingers but i got for my sister so she's fine with it.Overall 9 out of 10"
3,Fonts are small no way to adjust?,Nice phone but the fonts are too small for a big screen. Any way how to adjust to larger fonts please help.
4,GREAT PHONE,"This is a nice cellphone... I loaded it with a 1GIG card. Do the math... about 20-30% more song capacity if converted to ATRAC coding. GPRS 850 were im from. Has a special program that clears your calls, your basically speaking through a regular phone line. Picture and video editing on this phone, 30fps video, 3.2 mega pix cam... yep very clear..And oh yes... 100 BASS 100 TREBLE on this thing.Drawbacks:Slow operative system. s60 i guess. Dont take video or picture in dark places.. you will see nothing. Dont reduce bouncing on videos, youll see slow frames per sec.Dont drop it!!! very fragile."
3,Incomplete,This book is missing quite a bit of information. Why are the shem ham forash angels missing? This should be the cornerstone on which the book is built upon. The 72 angels associated with the name of God.
5,For the believer or the non believer.,"This book has listed every angel I have looked for, and does so from a non-biased point of view. It is an excellant reference book."
5,A Fantastic Research Tool,"This book is IT. While writing my debut novel, Psyche's Gate, I referred to Mr. Davidson's fantastic compilation of all things angelic again and again. From the well-known to the obscure, the highest Seraph to the lowest of the fallen angels, this book is a rich wellspring for the author, historian, student, theologan, or general fan of mythology."
4,Big Book!,"This book has a lot of entries in it, and lots of great information! I did not pick this up with an extensive prior knowledge of angels and similar mythology so I cannot say what is lacking in it - but I can say I found to be fairly in-depth and informative."
2,"Interesting, but not really truthful","I suppose it depends on what you'd consider truthful.. But I didn't really get anything out of it. I don't believe angels can do much for you.. But I guess if you're into witchcraft or angel worship, then you would get some use out of it. It's got some pretty names, and some interesting ideas, but it's one of those ""every religion is right, why can't we all just get along"" type of books, and I just didn't have any real use in it. One of my ""friends"" stole my copy, so I guess it was never meant to be."
3,"It tellls good things about Angels, But it has bad parts","The reason I think some parts are wrong is because it might lead people into believeing that Angels are better and more poweful thsn their creature God. People get images of Angels as sweet,Graceful creatures but than God gets the image of a huge stuborn guy that sends people to Hell. Jess B"
2,Dissappointing,"Basically it's just a book of names. Not at all what I expected. I figured it would have some sense of a story connected with it in some other sections, but it doesn't. It's put together with also conflicting info on where some of the angels even are situated. The author even states angels cannot be in two places at once in his forward regardless of their speed ability. The end of the book has some enchantment spells that have nothing to do with God, as the author even mentions Jesus condemned this. He conteracts with the statement that this wasn't always condemned. The fact remains it is a practice that is condemned now by God in heaven. Satan is very smart so we must be careful to see through the disguise. Who needs to known about the fallen angels names? Angels don't usually tell you their names as God doesn't want us to worship them. Be careful if you decide this one is for you. You may end up needing the exocism words it also has at he end of the book."
1,Not for True Believers in God of Abraham Issac & Jacob,Occultic - skimmed book looked at references (mostly occult) placed in trash can & delivered to dump! HAD to use up one star to rate it but it is a minus infinity of don't read.
5,Ever Better Than I Had Hoped!,"I have been working on a novel involving angels for the last few years, but I had found that the story was going stale lately. I ran across this book on my recommendation list, and it immediately caught my eye. I hesistated about buying it for a little while, afraid that I would be disappointed with ""Dictionary of Angels"".I am so glad that I finally decided to buy it. I recieved it just yesterday, and I am already reading it through for the second time. I couldn't put it down; I was devouring all of the wonderful entries. I learned more about angels--and about the religions and mythology that included them--than I ever thought I would.Through this book, I had found lots of good ideas that are inspiring me. I just don't know if I will be able to fit them all into my story!"
3,good information,very good information but still need more photos of the angels if possiblewadeed nour/EGYPT.
3,Not what I expected,"This is a well researched book, but unless you happen to meet these individuals I really see no need to ever read the book again. I guess I might want to check a claim made by someone, but I can't remember the last time I had such a conversation with anyone. I thought the book would classify and rank and then tie their functions back to the needs of God. What the book did tell me that even in the afterlife I""m grouped, regulated, and governed in much the same way I am in this material world. Guess I'll have some sort of boss to answer to for eternity, only diff is that I'll be happier being bossed around after death....oh well. I can't see myself usimg this book too much in this life."
3,Too fictional,"I found this book to be very good and thorough, but too much of it's information is fictional. A lot of the references are from Paradise Lost, or Faust, etc. NOT real sources, but fictional figments of imagination. You must separate the gold from the dross throughout the whole book."
4,Dictionary of Angels,"This book is not for those looking for airy fairy great and wonderful. It is for those whose heart can take the truth that all Angels do not have the most wonderful of positions. Read without judgment as we all have jobs that are not what others would prefer to do. This is for someone who is in need of the whole and is able to take the information and what they have found and make decisions on matters without second guessing themselves. Not good for an Angels first read. Stick to Doreen Virtue for the first few reads and as you can handle that Angels have true personalities and are real beings Or as least as real as we are, then you will be able to see the worth of this reference."
4,"fast good clean no hassle, and most of all great book","fast good clean no hassle, and most of all great book. i recommend this company"
2,Not as I expected,"If I new more about angels and wanted to look them up by name, this dictionary would be great. But as it is, there isn't anything to explain all of the thousands of dictionary angel listings. I bought the book to learn about angels and their different dominions, but was dissapointed at only finding dictionary listings. And those listings werent very descriptive."
4,one of the best though not the newest Ukr. dic,"I know thw Author - he was a professor of Ukrainian philology, specialist in Applied Linguistics - a dean of my faculty at the University. He was a real Pro. Buy his books they are worthy of it!"
4,"Very informative on the Y2K bug, but a little sensational","Since I work in the computer industry and have for the past 15 years, I am well aware of the Y2K bug. For someone who knows nothing about computers, this book is like reading a horror story. Everything that has a computer in it, will have massive problems (at least according to this book). While many of the problems are exaggerated, the Y2K issue is presented in a very enjoyable story. I really enjoyed this book, as long as I took the impending diasasters (planes falling out of the sky, nuclear reactors shutting down, etc.) with a grain of salt. Still a very good, fast paced read."
1,"DO NOT BUY (OR READ)! Loaded with mistakes, poor writing","I finished reading this book just to see how bad it could get by the end. Released in September 1999, the author should have known that Y2K was already big news, even with the Everyday Joe. He writes about embedded chips (that have no need for any date or time information) failing and causing massive systems failure. He has nuclear reactors failing or being taken offline. In perhaps the most egregious error, he suggests that the NY subway could fail due to computer error -- when in reality, it is well-known that the display board at Jay Street was never correctly wired, and all switches and signals are mechanically controlled.The plot is severely lacking. Four geeks rewrite the entire city infrastructure in two years -- and are stuck on some control passwords! A multi-billionaire wants to cheat the bank whose systems his company is rewriting!This book has no basis in reality. Any similarity to Planet Earth as we know it is coincidental."
3,Worth reading.,"As good as Lucifer's Hammer. But, geez, some whoppers. The anti-hero wants money sent via electronic blips, never asking how he'll get it back, post y2k.A store at Broadway and 96th with 80,000 sq. ft.? I think not. And it has ""linoleum"" on the floor? Is this the l930's? Worst, the author never deals with the fact that saving NYC from the y2k ""bug"" means nothing. In 48 hours, that non-producing, dependent-on-the-rest-of-the-world city will go as dark as the rest of the globe. Good dialogue."
2,"Too little, too late","After reading Joseph Massucci's ""The Millennium Project,"" I was eager for another page-turning Y2K thriller. Unfortunately, this isn't it -- in fact, I couldn't help wondering how much of this material was ""borrowed."" Plotwise the two books share a lot in common, but the excitement quickly ends here. Joseph's ""Deadline Y2K: A Novel"" stretches credibility to the limit, and his stereo-typical characters are recycled from a dozen movies (Robert Redford, Dan Aykroyd, River Phoenix in ""Sneakers"" -- unfortunately they're not as clever). Joseph acknowledges his agent for giving him the idea to do a Y2K novel. Obviously he wasn't sufficiently inspired to doing something original with the subject. Too bad his agent didn't do the writing too!"
3,Timely subject--Yummy Read,"Mark Joseph's new novel raises some startling and often disturbing questions about the potential effects of the Y2K ""bug"" and the very nature of millenialism itself--all within the framework of an entertaining narrative. Joseph writes to romp here: the action is crisp, the characters are believable (due to some good research and detective work)and the plot flows full steam ahead to a conclusion we should all expect( that IS why we bought the book). There's even some interesting insight along the way. Take it for what it is, kick back, and learn a little about the ""bug."" All in all, a fine novel by an author who knows how to make us think ""techno."" Three Stars!"
5,little girl's delight,My son's step-daughter received these along with other items in the Calico Critters line. She is enjoyong them very much.
3,Great for storage,My daughter doesn't play with this as a house but it is great to keep all the critters in. She has a C.C. dollhouse so it's hard to say whether she would use it as such if she didn't have one. It is pretty durable unless your kid wants to also use it as a place to sit. I would say this is best for storage.
4,keeps everything tidy,Calico Critters come with lots of little pieces...this is a great place to keep all those little pieces.
4,A great compromise and wonderful place to store the critters!,"I have bought lots of the Calico Critters family series from Amazon and when I saw this case, I thought it would be a great compromise - i.e. not having to buy the more expensive Calico Critter houses. As a lot of the Calico Critter playsets come with tiny accessories, this carry n play case is practical as it has sufficient storage space for them. Also, this is a great case to bring along on playdates, or when travelling. My daughter was able to store some furniture, accessories, and up to a dozen Calico Critters in it when we travelled recently. My only complaint is the latch which is not strongly reinforced and opens easily. So, one has to be extra careful when carrying the case. But overall, I'd rate this item as a great alternative to purchasing the more expensive homes in the series, and a practical way to store and transport the critters and accessories."
4,A great place to put toys that are so much fun!,"We have gotten a lot of use out of our Calico Critters carry case. I was buying my daughter a few of the small sets for Christmas, but didn't want to invest in one of the (really cool looking) houses that went with the sets. I decided to get her the carrying case instead so at least she would have a place to store the Critters. My daughter loved the Critters right away and loved the carrying case. As far as she was concerned, the case was their ""house."" She was 3.5 at the time and it was really just perfect for her. The case has helped us keep the Critters from getting lost. We have a rule that all the CC have to stay on one table when she's playing with them and they have to go back in the case when she's done. When we're having a huge, chaotic playdate, I stick the case up on a high shelf so the pieces don't get scattered to wind. This has been a great purchase for us, a wonderful accessory for some much-beloved little animal friends."
2,Lamp problem,"I purchased the 52hmx84 in Feb 05. The lamp blew the first time in October of 2005 and Toshiba covered it under warantee. The lamp just blew again in Jun 06. This now seems to be covered under an extended warantee. Cost of the bulbs is $[...] plus shipping. I got about 4333 hours on each bulb. Anyone interested in buying this model of DLP should purchase a lamp to keep on hand since the wait time could be a few days depending on mailing. Toshiba only has 8 parts distributors in the U.S. they told me, although it seems to be available online from other sources. The Picture is great and the built in speakers are good. I notice no difference between component input quality and the HDMI input so that's a user preference."
1,steer clear of hdlp Toshiba tv's!!!,"Whatever you do - steer clear of Toshiba HDLP tv's!! We have had ours for four years and are on our 4th lamp replacement. I suggest doing an internet search before you buy, because we are not alone!! There have been serious problems with the HDLP lamps from Toshiba. Nothing more frustrating than to be watching your favorite show or ball game and have the lamp burn out and be without your TV until you get a replacement!!!"
1,Great tv when it works!!!,I bought this television while an employee of a large electronics retailer. The picture quality was rivaled only by the samsung dlp at the time and was a perfect addition to my THX certified home theater system. I knew about the lifespan expectancy of the lamps and purchased a service plan to go along with my tv. I have gone through a lamp every year with my tv and it has often taken a month or more to receive my replacement lamp from the service plan provider. I would not recommend purchasing from this television and am cautious to purchase a television from them in the future with as many problems as I have had.
3,DLP TAX,"Be prepared to buy a new lamp each year. I call it the DLP Tax.Toshiba refused to admit these bulbs only last 2-3000 Hrs. I have spoken to Authorized service center, they admit a new lamp each year is to be expected."
2,flawed technology,"Anytime you see ""Texas Instruments"" on something, you should stay away. Despite that, I bought this thing in 2005 because of the price and picture quality. I'm happy with Toshiba, as I haven't had any problems whatsoever with the tv other than bulb replacements. At $200 a crack though, this gets to be a very expensive tv. The last bulb lasted about 7 months. Decided to get a new led instead of springing for another bulb. Led-lcd technology has been around a long time and keeps improving. Texas Insturment's DLP technology is a dead horse. Tv is now in local landfill."
1,Inspect screen carefully before accepting delivery.,"Before signing and accepting delivery of any Toshiba DLP, be sure to check the screen to make sure that the coating on the inside of the screen is uniform. On mine, there was a circle about 10"" in diameter that you can see in certain lighting and even when the TV is off! It will appear lighter than the surrounding areas at times and can be annoying. I called Toshiba and had a service man come out and even though he acknowledged that this is common, Toshiba will not replace the screen. I would have given them a negative 10 if it were possible just because of their attitude. So, look at the screen VERY carefully before accepting or purchasing. If you see this problem, refuse to accept it. Or else just buy a Samsung or Mitsubishi DLP to avoid the problem I have."
2,Great Picture - BUT DO NOT BUY IT!,"The Toshiba DLP televisions will be the demise of their reputation! They have a great picture but the bulb lasts less than a year! My 52HM84 is two years old and I have replaced the bulb TWICE! At $200 a shot, this is ridiculous. When I contacted Toshiba Customer Service they acknowledged a problem with the 2005 bulbs, and extended the warrantee to two years, but ""claim"" there is no problem with the 2006 TVs. When I asked him if replacing the bulb every year was what he considered ""no problem"" he read a prepared statement and said he could do nothing for me.DO NOT BUY THIS TV or any other Toshiba Product! Sites like this should make Toshiba pay for flipping their nose up at poor Customer Service.SPREAD THE WORD!"
2,Nice while it works,"The Toshiba DLP is a nice TV when it works. Unfortunately, I began to have problems the second day of use. Without warning the picture went blank after a few hours of viewing on day 2. To get the picture back the set needed to be unplugged and repowered. Over the next 10 days the picture disappeared another 5-7 times. With only 2 weeks of use, my new Toshiba DLP has been in the shop for 3 weeks and it appears it will be there another 2 -3 weeks.All I can say is read and understand the Amazon.com warranty and return policy for this item and expect little if any assistance if you should have a problem. I would also suggest that you check out your local Toshiba service center for their service and reputation. If you have a problem with your set you will be at their mercy, so beware."
2,"Great Picture, Very Poor Lamp Life","Great Picture and Sound. VERY poor lamp life. My kids do watch the TV quite a bit, but I am getting only around 10 months out of a year. At $180.00 per bulb, this TV could be expensive. I am lucky that I purchased an extended warranty that covers the bulb. It has definitely paid for itself."
3,2 lamps in 2 years,Had this tv for 2 years and now I have to buy my second lamp. Was happy w/ the tv but this is just crazy! I guess there is a reason why I got a pretty good deal on it.
1,not bad but expected more - lamp problems,"Purchased this brand new and the lamp burned out in 3 months which was replaced under warranty and the lamp went out again 18 months later.The speakers are poor quality, they crack and make popping sounds. Toshiba claimed they were the signal but there is no popping or cracking sound when I play the same movies through my stereo. I'm just putting up with the popping sound since the sound quality is much better through the stereo anyway.The picture quality is great but I expected the lamp to last longer and expect better service when you call to say there is a sound problem...they just dismissed my complaint about the speaker quality.Since I've written this review...I've purchased 3 lamps in about 3 years totaling over $500 in lamp replacements....almost 1/3 the cost of the TV. They need to recall this TV."
4,Good Product,"This is a good product for the money. Although it isn't as clear as other TV's (because it is the older generation DLP), you get what you pay for. This product is $1000 cheaper than equivalent newer generation models. If you want a solid big screen TV, but don't want to spend $2800, considier buying the previous generation TV's. They change every year. I am very satisfied with the overall quality."
1,Toshiba 52 inch TV bulbs,I have had my TV since 2006. I have replaced the bulb 5 times. The time between bulbs has been getting shorter and shorter (last time 6 months). This is a major inconvenience and is an added yearly expense. I would not recommend this TV or any Toshiba TV because of this issue.
2,***BEWARE*** FLAWED BULBS!!!,"Beautiful TV when it works but the bulbs do not last anywhere near 6,000 to 8,000 hours as Toshiba claims. So unless you want to spend hundreds of dollars each year on replacement lamps.....DO NOT BUY THIS TV. I also had to pay $400 for a new ballast! RIDICULOUS."
2,52HM84 - Purchased 3/05 - 3 Lamps now /,Bought the unit at Best Buy. Paid $2099. This is more then my first car cost. My first car ran longer.I have had 2 lamps replaced under the Best buy service plan. Now I need to replace it on my own. No big deal - it's only 2 screws. The issue is that you have to order the darn thing. You have to make sure you order a ORSON brand bulb or you will only get 1/2 the life out of it. The lowest cost I can find is $133.00.The TV is 5 years old. - The cost is low for the fix but it's a pain in the rear.
1,unreliable 52HM84,"I have had my 52"" for 4 years and am on my 3 bulb @ $250/ea, not to mention the $368 to have a ballast replaced. Our salesman conveniently left out the problems with a DLP. We should have opted for the LCD and I will not be buying another unreliable Toshiba."
2,Great Picture but too many issues.....,"TV is overpriced for all the issues.. Ive replaced the bulb in the last 4 months, speaker just stopped working and now the darn thing wont turn on again! I am not about to buy another bulb!!! Come on these manufacturers need to step up their products if they are gonna charge these prices for Tvs!!I would not buy again.."
4,the ultimate picture book,"This a great book if you're looking to decorate your room, but it's not much for explanations. It is very lacking in text, but then again, the prints more than speak for themselves. A great book for any art collector."
5,The Master's Work Is Incomparable,"This is a good collection of da Vinci's drawings. It is one of the best among those in the Dover Art Library. A few of the pictures so vividly captured the instantaneous expressions of men in various emotional states that one is left breathless by da Vinci's incomparable power of observation and stunning drawing skills. Another bunch of drawings had complicated contents and they all showed amazingly accurate perspective geometry. One is left with no doubt that the great artist is no less a great scientist.This book, being a collection of drawings, does little to teach, but it is a good reference and a standard of excellence for comparison with other drawings. I recommend it for any serious art student."
1,Not very good,The reprints in this book are of absoultely terrible quality. If you are planning to use them as sources for drawings forget it! There are other Dover books that are better such as Sargent's. This book is of no use at all.
2,Leonardo Drawings,"This book is good ,my only problem are the drawings. They are not as clear and clean as some other books of drawings I have. In all this book is still a fair buy."
4,A must read,"I knew I was going to enjoy this book when I found on page three attribution of Ivan Illich's Medical Nemesis. This book chronicles the history of iatrogenic illness, which continues and remains inevitable as medicine is practiced in the US."
2,Uninteresting,"In a time when entire cities have covered themselves with force fields and taken to the stars, a young boy is kidnapped from earth and taken into space aboard one such flying town. Eventually, he proves himself to be invaluable to the survival of his adopted home.This is a very clunky novel. It is poorly written, with uninteresting characters and dull plotting. There are far too many lengthy conversations and dull exposition-Blish tells when he ought to be showing. Like many older science fiction novels, it displays a nave infatuation with technology that has not aged well-for example, a city that is governed by infallible computers is held to be superior to one that is controlled by mere men. Blish fails to develop adequately his intellectual theme-that a knowledge of history and its lessons is an invaluable guide to coping with the future-and the moments of high adventure are presented in stiff, workmanlike fashion. Not recommended."
1,Arrived damaged,The item had two slices in the left front pocket.We returned it to Fogdog and requested a replacement be shipped and that we did not want a credit.when I next heard from them they said they were issuing a Credit. We sent a e-mail and again said we did not want a credit. The next thing we knew we received a e-mail saying that a credit had been issued. We are NOT HAPPY!Mary Maskill
3,good if you want something light,"If you are looking for something light while you're waiting at the airport, etc., this is a good book. She does repeat herself a little bit, but maybe some people find that helpful if they can't remember characters."
1,Soap,"If a poorly written soap opera theme is to your liking, this may be a book to read...In my opinion it is just plain awful,immature,fairy tale..nothing rings true...except one's desire for a child..How on earth did a publisher ever accept it.."
4,A great comfort read,"Lydia Hoffman opens up a yarn store of Blossom Street. She is hoping to start a new chapter in her life, after battling cancer since her teens. Lydia starts a beginner's class for knitting.Jacqueline Donovan decides to join the group to make a baby blanket in the hopes it will make amends to her son and daughter in law.Carol Girard decides making a baby blanket will make her dreams of having a baby come true.Alix Townsend is the least likely to join a knitting class. Alix has had a rough life and is trying to get her life back on track. She decides to make a blanket for the Linus projectAll four women come into the class with various needs but they learn so much more about themselves as well as each other.Debbie Macomber writes such treasures of books. You feel like you know these characters and want to find out more about them."
4,A sweet and comfy read,"A cozy story about friendships and babies! The characters were very believable and well-rounded with great stories, even if a couple of the plots were tiny bit predictable. I wish there had been more involvement with the knitting angle. All the male love interests knights in shining amour, but I guess we need that every now and then. Regardless, this is a sweet book that will leave you feeling inspired and happy!"
5,EXCELLENT,"excellent on time description quality ALL WERE EXCELLENT ,ON TIME , EARLIER THEN I EXPECTED, CLEAN SEALED EVERYTING WAS CORRECT"
4,The Shop On Blossom Street,The book and characters and description of the neigborhood makes you want to go visit and walk the streets that Debbie describes.
3,Full of hope.,"Lydia Hoffman wants a fresh start in life, so she opens a knit shop. The shadow of death has loomed over her for too long, even though she is very young. It seems appropriate that the project she advertises as the first for her classes is to knit a baby blanket.Her students are a mixed lot. Jaquie is about to become a reluctant grandmother. Carol desperately hopes for a baby, though the odds are against it. Alix is there to perform community service, knitting for the Linus project. Despite their glaring differences, the four women not only knit blankets but friendships and knit the bridges in their other relationships.*** Debbie Macomber, whether her heroines are spirit beings or ordinary women, always writes about angels, messengers of God. Her stories are full of hope, and though not billed as inspirational, per se, they never fail to inspire. This is a sterling example of that rule. ***Amanda Killgore"
5,Four lives knit together...,"Four women with very different backgrounds come together through knitting classes. A cancer survivor, a young woman who's hard on the outside, a society matron and a woman desperate to become a mother. The story takes these lives through a year of turmoil and growth.Macomber knits a gentle tale of friendship, of hope...of love. Guarenteed to touch your heart."
5,Very Good Read,This is a very good read. It is funny and touches the heart all in the same time. Iread it in 2 days.
4,Can't wait to read the rest of the series.....,"This is the first book in the Blossom Street series, and an introduction to the people on Blossom Street. I'm one that enjoys coming a little late to the party in a series of books, so if I really like the first one I can have a reading marathon without waiting a year for another in the series to come out. Macomber is wonderful at character development, and you find yourself really invested in the people in the book. Some of the plot was predictable, but satisfying. I'm looking forward to reading 'A Good Yarn' next."
2,Not good.,"I thought the dialogue was awkward and overly dramatic, and the whole storyline was unrealistic. Many times, the author repeated herself, as if she forgot that a particular point had already been made just a few pages before. There wasn't enough character development, either."
2,Pat ending disappoints,"This book was a quick read, and the knitting aspects were fun, but the end was too easy and very disappointing."
1,Painfully Boring,I have to say that this book came highly recommended by some ladies in my knitting group. For me it was a painful read. The dialogue was simplistic and the plot was predictable. Macomber's characters are lame and outdated. I do not recommend this book for anyone who wishes to be challenged intellectually or emotionally. I gave it one star only because there is a knitting pattern in the book.
2,Formulaic and predictable,"This is the story of four women: Lydia, a cancer survivor who opens a yarn store, and her first three customers/students, Jacqueline, a society matron, Carol, a business woman trying to get pregnant, and wild-child Alix. The book takes us through their lives and how being in a knitting group together changes them.This was, by far, the most predictable, formulaic book I've ever read. As soon as every woman's story, and those of supporting characters, was laid out, I knew exactly what was going to happen with each main character, and, sadly, I was right.It's a fine story if you're looking for a comfortable, female-centric feel-good novel. But don't come to this looking for any depth. It's very simply a light, happily-ever-after.As a yarn-crafter, and member of my own crafting group, I wanted to love this book. I'm a little sad that I didn't."
5,Loving this series,This is my second Debbie Macomber series and I love it as much as the first. She has a way of writing that makes you feel like you are there and can see every expression. I love the way she brings together unlikely people who become friends and help each other through their various life circumstances.
5,She's done it again!,"This is a heartwarming book about four very different women who come together in a knitting class. It is classic Debbie Macomber, a compelling story that gives the reader hope for the future as each woman comes to terms with her lot in life, finds the gumption to succeed -- no matter what her aspirations -- and learns to understand and appreciate the people around her. I'd love to see the story go on to the women in the next class. I loved it!"
5,Comfortable and yet sexy!,"Honestly, I think that the boyleg panty is the most exciting thing to come along in woman's fashions in a while. They are comfortable and durable, but also decidedly feminine. In particular, I love this boyleg. I really like the way it gathers so flatteringly in the back, and the suggestive loop in the material. I highly recommend this panty to every woman who wants to be comfortable and yet sexy!(Review of Necessary Objects Precious Things Boyleg)"
4,makes life and the gospel make sense,"I had a real hard time with The Miracle of Forgiveness, and this book was recomended to me by a friend. Nothing has made the atonement of Christ more clear. Although it uses a lot of LDS scripture, I believe a lot of people from other faiths would find this a good read. I enjoyed it, and I'm far from the cookie cutter Utah Mormon. It's definately worth the time to pick up and study."
5,must read!,"The first of Stephen E. Robinson's duo, it is a ""must read"" for anyone wanting to gain further understanding and appreciatation of the Savior's role in your life."
5,Loved it,"This is a great book, which gives many aides to help understand the atonement better. Maybe not every example will strike a chord, but all in all each person should find something to help them and bless them."
5,Hope,"This is an awesome book. It gives you hope for a future if you are trying even if you are not able to do everything. You find out if you believe the things Christ said it doesn't matter that you are developed into perfection now or in the future, You just need to be trying. I have recommended it to others and will continue doing so."
1,Crashes WinXP and Win2000,"Before you buy, look at the makers support site, which lists tons of problems: www.disney.go.com/cdromsupport. I have sooo many programs on my 2 computers, and only very very rarely a program crashes. On my WinXP the Disney Software does install, but does not start. Under Win2000 it starts and crashes after a few minutes. Totally unbelievable for a name like Disney. I had the same problems with the old Disney Timon and Pumba Jungle Games, which only runs under very old Windows versions, so old, that I forgot which windows version it was."
2,Only runs in Mac Classic Mode,"I ordered this because it said it was compatible with OS X, however it will not install because it must be run in Mac Classic mode, and my computer (like many OS X models) doesn't have Classic anymore. Very sad children!"
1,obsolete and outdated,"made for XP and lower OS'S. Thats about 2 operateing systems ago !!! its windows 7 now,then was Vista then XP.software crashes newer computers with script errors.game will load but the next time you go to play it it crashes. Disturbing disney is so far behind with software."
3,"Very fun games, lousy software.","Long story short - this bundle is lots of fun for kids and lots of headache for parents. The games are great. They are actually very educational and appropriate for my 3 year old's computer skills. The games are fun; even my six year old loves them. Unfortunately, they seem to be dependent on a very specific graphics driver. The games run ok on my Vista system - after totally crashing it right after install - if you make sure to exit the game properly every time. Otherwise, Vista crashes and you have to uninstall the software to get it to stop booting in safe mode. The Winnie the Pooh and Mickey Mouse games run better on XP but I couldn't get the Stanly game to load there at all. We'll keep this package because the kids love it but over all I'm VERY disappointed that Disney would license such a mess."
5,If you are ever stuck in a tent.....,"When the author of this book was climbing Denali he and his party were stuck in an inevitable long storm and ""John Christopher"" kept the climbing party from going stir-crazy by reciting the wonderful verse from this book.In the vein of Robert Service, these poems in verse capture the beauty, the agony, the good times and bad of climbing big walls and sitting out big storms.""John"" should know because he climbed 4 of the seven summits before his untimely death in 1997.If you like mountains, mountain climbing and wonderfully descriptive verse,get this book. Put it in your back pack. Because, as you know, you never know when you may be sitting there for days on end, staring at the ripstop and wishing you had something heroic to read. Submitted by Bill Hoke for Dennis Burke"
3,english book,"unfortunately, i didn't read well enough to realize that this was not the correct book. I wanted the 5th edition of this book but i purchased the 2nd. Other than that, the book got here in great time and i have not complaints other than my stupid mistake of buying the wrong book."
5,"don't know about the book, but the shipper was awesome!","Bought this book from Luna Coffey on amazon. There was no image and I accidentally bought the wrong book. However, the book got here very quickly and was in great shape! When I realized I had order the wrong book, I requested return instructions. I got a very quick response and sent book back. The full amount was refunded as soon as the book was received on their end. This review is for the shipper, not the book, and i would most certainly order from them again."
2,A little Disappointed,"If your looking at something that will cut a lot of grass at one time, this is not for you. It's good for a small ammount at a time and that's it. It's very hard to get any leverage for cutting tough grass. Would not recommend."
2,locks up,"I wouldn't purchase these a second time. Within a week of normal use I had issues with them not opening correctly and locking up. They swivel which is why I bought them, I thought it would come in handy. The not opening easily and locking up take away from that. I would definitely not recommend them for anyone with any sort of physical disability because you need a strong hand to unlock the push lever. Sometimes it doesn't want to slide. I wanted to like them, but they need to go back to the drawing board on these. I even find myself looking for my old clippers that I wanted to replace over these."
1,Riddled with factual errors,The respected boston1775 blog reviewed the book and filled up two screens with scores of factual errors. This is obviously not the book that students should use to write their reports. See [...]
4,"April 19th, plus","This is a compelling historical tale, filled with well-sketched characters and a ton of detail about life and warfare in the 18th century. I know that some readers will disagree with some of its conclusions - Samuel Adams is portrayed as the single most important person in the Colonial drift toward revolution - but I found it to be a well-written and well-argued book.Clarification on one point: Hallahan's book isn't actually about one day - it details the battles of Lexington and Concord, then goes on to describe what occurred in New York, Philadelphia, Williamsburg and London when word of those battles reached those cities."
1,A good idea wasted,"I found this book to be riddled with errors about Boston in the Revolution. The author mixes up several figures with similar names, such as James Warren and Dr. Joseph Warren. He accuses Samuel Adams of breaking into a governor's house to steal letters; those letters were actually obtained in London. Statements on two pages about John Adams's 1770 political career contradict each other, and neither is correct. And those are only some of the errors I saw in a one-day skim. As a result, I distrust the book's sections on other American towns. What could have been a fine opportunity to trace the start of the Revolution is squandered by poor research."
4,Cute...,"It's very cute, a little darker than expected,size was just right. all in all a sweet little ring."
3,Agate Ring,It's a decent product but the picture of it is a little deceiving from what was actually delivered.
4,beginners handbook,This is a good book to start Karting with. It covers all the basics. Expierenced Karters will want a more in depth book on the subjects of fine tuning chassis and engine. I would recommend this book to any one who wants to try the sport of Karting.
3,Okay on all levels,Okay on all levelsThis is the non sensible choice in comparison to The Karting Manual: The Complete Beginner's Guide to Competitive Kart Racing - 2nd Edition.I would recommend this only to those who have read The Karting Manual: The Complete Beginner's Guide to Competitive Kart Racing - 2nd Edition and want more to read.Not very well organized or thought out.-Timbo
1,"Rubbish!, Full of false information.","The books is FULL of false information, it has alot of mistakes in it.If you drive like this book teaches you, you will probably end up dead last. For example. this book teaches you to go on throttle on the straight, while in reality you should be on the throttle before the apex.It even has mistakes in very simple things like aluminium, or magnesium wheels. It claims that aluminium wheels offer better cooling, while in reality it is the exact opposite."
2,Karting Disapointment,"""Karting: Everything You Need to Know"": while useful, the book did not meet my expectations. I expected a more detailed ""Technical"" publication. While this is OK for raw beginners, not recommended for someone looking for a more technical solutions & ""Hints & Kinks"" format."
5,Excellent info for the new or experienced karter!,"My daughter has been racing for 1 year (won 1st place in her class last year), this the beginning of her second season. She is gaining experience, but this book provides some advanced info like running the proper line, taking corners efficiently, etc. It has excellent photography too that assists with explaining the info more clearly."
2,what was that?,"well, saying the truth I've expected something much more concrete...the authors are just beating about the bush. You will learn all around and nothing about. No attention to the main thing in karting - driver. No driver technique or tricks described.But maybe it could be useful for someone who just don’t really understand what is karting."
5,Awesome Book,"I've been studying this type of information for the last 12 years and I find this to be so very ""on"" as it were. If you're looking for some insight into your world this is definitely a good book!"
4,Cards of Destiny,Thought this book was nice but have bought other books like this with more interesting infromation.
5,The Perfect Gift for Friends and Ourselves on our Birthdays!,"Sharon Jeffers has captured an ancient Oracle and given it a Voice. She calls it a birthday book, but really it's a powerful book of wisdom for bringing us to a better understanding of ourselves, and greater clarity in how others see us. This simple system of the cards and birthdays is based on an ancient western calendar that was originally used for divination, but which disappeared from the radar for a very long time. Till Sharon (and a few others) got the download for this generation. Every spiritual bookshelf should have a copy of ""Cards of Destiny""."
2,Granite Horses,I was a bit let down by this video -- too many images of statues and not enough live footage. The producers meant well and are to be admired for their effort.
4,Horses of Gettysburg,Well done Documentery on the war horses. Really opens your eyes to the struggles of using all animals to wage war. I only wish it had been longer.
3,No longevity. But well done.,"This is a good game. Wont play it long, but what there is can be fun.Real potential for a super game, shame it wasnt expanded on.My son who is 4 absolutely loves it. And I passed it onto him to play with."
4,"It's the language, not the story...","Read this for the language. The plots suffer from the sentimentality found in so many great 19C novels. Eliot draws you into pastoral English life and observes the scenes there with images that cannot be found in weaker fiction of the kind. There is a delightful description of vicar Barton by his fire with pipe and gin, enjoying the contrasting wet and dry. Her language here holds you, stops the reader and forces him to sigh. These stories are full of wonderful insights and descriptions, and these are what hold the reader. Of course, it should be understood that Eliot will not be read by anyone much amused by pop/tv culture. If only we could be entertained by tv we wouldn't have to put effort into our rewards."
5,Just what a little girl wants on her bike.,This is exactly what I was looking for and my daughter loves it!Great for her medium girl's bicycle.
4,Love the retro look....brings back childhood memories.,"The basket itself is very sturdy and you can't beat the price. But, have glue on hand 'cuz the flowers may fall off."
3,basket was good but did not have mounting device,"The basket is nice and durable and looks just as pictured. The problem was that the basket came without any method for mounting it. No hooks, ties or any way to attach the basket to a bike were included."
4,The Longwood I never knew,"Longwood has a historic downtown area that I drive through on the way to work each day. Still the history in this book was new to me. There are a lot of old photos. As it is said, a picture is work a thousand words. The photos convey how it really was better that more words could.One may have to be at least slightly acquainted with the area for this book to be of interest."
3,Not as good as Rien's other books,"I didn't really enjoy this book as some of Rien's other work. Don't get me wrong, it's still wonderful artwork, and a bargain at the price here. If you are like me and have to have ALL his books, by all means, get it. But if you are trying to choose between this one and some of his others, like Dogs or Life in Holland, pass on this book."
4,sooo sweet,"Club 8 was formed in 1995 by Karolina Komstedt (from the band Poprace) and Johan Angergrd (Acid House Kings, Poprace). Its about boy / girl teen romance. Obviously many critics dismiss it out of hand. But to me, Mr. Whimsey, its great to hear the slight sweet voice of Karolina singing about young love. With sooo much pain in rock and life, who cant like something like a parfait of music."

4,Great beginner metal detector,"This is a really good inexpensive way to try metal detecting. I've been using it in the ""all metal"" mode which is an easy way to get started. I have used it a few times and find it to be quite sensitive. So far I've found coins, a few pieces of cheap jewelry, and a lot of trash items (bottle caps, hair pins, foil...) The trash can be filtered out easily by adjusting the knobs and switch on the console. I was just in a hurry to use it and didn't want to miss anything. One thing it doesn't seem to detect very well is very small gold chains without pendants. This might be true of all metal detectors. I don't know because this is the only one I've ever used. It uses two 9v batteries which can be expensive, but I picked up an inexpensive pair of headphones which seem to increase the battery life. Overall I'm very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this product to anybody that wanted to give metal detecting a try without investing too much."
5,Thrilled in Michigan,"I bought this product for my 13 year old son's birthday, and he was thrilled. I was thrilled because it was easy to put together, works great over many different terrains, and is so easy to use, the whole family has enjoyed it! It is the perfect Tracker for us."
5,Bounty hunter review,"I have never used a metal detector in my life before, but this has just the right amount of features so that i can find some good metal without getting confused! It was easy to get used to the beeps and sounds and i could quickly determine how deep an object was and what type of metal it is. Great detector for an even better price. Could not be happier."
1,wow,The Bounty hunter IV goes off when i walk or jigle it. It makes it very hard to trust that it actually works. I look around the snow and nothing is there when it does go off. sucks to use it.
1,Bounty Hunter tk4-pl,"Package came undamaged I assbled product and put into my gun safe, a couple days later I was plowing my driveway and lost my keys so I decided to try it out, read directions and turned it on. The power came on but the product was defective I laid keys on the ground and some change some bolts and other objects and tried every setting it had, and it would not detect any metal at all. would not recomend product to anyone, Had big hopes and excitement and was let down buy this poor product."
2,Won't Detect Wire,"I bought the Bounty Hunter to locate my underground low voltage wire to my lighting system. It wouldn't detect any of the wires underground. So, I cut a piece of the same type wire and laid it on my garage floor just to make sure it would detect the wire on the surface. It would not detect the wire at all. It works fine on all the test items recommended in the manual i.e,. like nails, coins of all types aluminum foil etc. but won't detect the wire at all. Anyone had any success with detecting wire? I only gave it two stars because it wouuldn't work on what I bought it for."
2,middle of the road,"I bought this bounty hunter in feb of this year, it was ok, i found old bottles from the 20s an old dagger and a silver spoon. so for non precious metals its ok. a bit hard to hone in with the dials. can hardly tell between the tone and the beep. i took it to Georgia recently to go gold panning, it never went off on any gold. even with a vile full of pure gold. but rings with filler it did fine. and in streams it did detect a phone cable 18 inches down (sorry bell south) but had it shown what i was looking for id never dug it up. dont worry I covered it back, honest mistake, this detector doest work in salt water. but fresh water it does great. but not for gold. im gonna invest in a better brand. this is good for trash and coins but the good stuff such as pure gold coins forget it. silver as long as its newer then 1900s."
5,"THIS IS AWESOME, BUY IT NOW","We are 12 year old twin brothers. We got this metal detector as a birthday gift. The first time we used it in our backyard, we found nails and pieces of wire. Next, we found a two handed cleaver/sword about 2 inches underground near an old house foundation. We are happy that it detects metal about a foot deep and also annoyed because it is so strong that it detects everything (metal). All our friends now want one. We highly recommend this affordable great piece of machinery."
5,good,"my husband enjoyed it , he`s been wanting one for a long time , so my son says get one and we did"
4,Good Deal for the Money,"I wasn't expecting too much, but this little guy DOES work pretty well. We are just amateurs at metal detecting, so this is fun if you aren't a professional."
3,Doesn't Detect Gold,"I bought this unit in the hopes of finding gold. It picks up all kinds of other things, poptop tabs, bottle caps, rusty nails, rusty bolts and nuts, rusty tin cans, and all these things buried up to 8 inches deep in the ground. But the one thing I want it to detect is GOLD. I have been searching for months using this detector, thinking it just wasn't finding anything. Then, recently, I got some gold, in sizes that I would expect to find in the ground. The detector would not sound off on anything I ran across. I have gold in very small sizes that you normally find in real life. I have some ""pickers"" that are not quite big enough to be called a nugget, but big enough to pick up with your fingers. The bounty hunter just would not sound off. I am disappointed to say the least."
5,"So far, so good","I'm happy with the Bounty Hunter so far. I haven't had time to use it much, but when I did it found lots of metal scraps & nails so I'm sure it would fine coins & jewelry if it was there. It's lightweight as advertised."
5,Perfect gift,Me and my mom bought this for my dad as a Christmas present. It was a huge hit. He's still getting the fine points down but the basics of using it are pretty straightforward.
2,Don' t purchase,This product is a waste of your money it gives off nothing but false readings .Got this for the grand kids now I have more holes then a gopher farm. False readings save your money.
5,Great Product,Great Product and fun to use. This is my second detector and i love it. Cant beat the price also.
4,Bounty Hunter TRACKERIV/TK4-PL Tracker IV metal detector,"My wife lost a gold anniversary necklace and I bought this as a long shot, hoping that I could find it around our property. No happy ending I'm afraid but I found six fairly recent coins on my first day out. As I searched, I found a lot of Aluminum, two axe heads, shell casings and more coins. The trick is adjusting the settings for the type of metal you want to find. Since I was looking for gold, I kept the sensitivity at about 90%, the discrimination at 50%, and the toggle switch on `tone'- after experimenting with other settings. Use headphones. If you experiment with it as the manual says, you can find things six inches or more down. I'm looking forward to the change of seasons so that I can get back to using it again. It is really fascinating to have the detector go off, then to dig and actually find something."
4,Just what the doctor ordered.,"Great bang for the buck, detector for me. Never using one before, I read alot of reviews and this one was in my price range. So far no treasures, but My idea was not to comb the whole yard in so many hours I am learning at my leasure and following the instructions. I am not disappointed."
4,A Great Hobby,"I bought this for my husband on his birthday. He needed a new hobby and I thought this was perfect. It gets him outdoors and it really is fun! The equipment is so easy to use and really light, so you don't get tired too easy. He loves it!"
4,Good for fun,"This is a fun detector for an amateur. I found a pretty cool old spoon in the yard. I would like to take it someplace more interesting, like an old forest, but have not made the time...it would be fun to find something truly valuable or ancient. With detailed reading of the manual, I am sure it would be easy to understand all it is capable of...I simply turned it on and used it...and found a spoon."
5,Awesome!,"Wow, for the price you pay for this, it's most certainly worth it! Packaged nice and securely, it's easy to assemble snapping the handle together. It is sturdy, very well made and so much fun when you hear the buzzer go off! It's compact, easy to store or carry along; lightweight (so it's easy for children to use) but packs a powerful punch when it comes to finding things like old bottles, jewelry, coins and some things that may not be valuable, but you have so much fun those things become valuable anyway. I would definitely recommend this metal detector for both beginners and advanced Treasure Hunters. You're getting your moneys worth and more! Happy hunting!"
4,bounty hunter,"i got this metal detector for my son for christmas. it is for a beginner. he said it works great, but he's ready to move on to a more advanced one. you get what you pay for. i would recomend this one for a beginner..."
2,Did not work.,"Detector froze up, after detecting an item. Mfg tech support said that was caused by a short in the battery wires."
4,Metal detector - watch out Dubloons,"I've not found any dubloons yet but I've picked up a lot of aluminum foil! It's fun, not terribly sensitive past about 3 inches but it gets you out in the open air and stirs the imagination. I'm a small woman and even as light as it is I find myself switching arms regularly. When you take it out take the instructions for setting it with you as it matters a great deal. Also, be sure you read all the small print on beach notices since most national park areas do not permit detectors. Follow all the moral guidance instructions because you do not want to do anything but leave footprints behind!"
2,NOT water proof,"Product was ok found some trash under ground ,but my biggest complaint is they claim that this detector is water proof up to electronic display, can tell u this is not the case with mine put coil in water after that it went ballistic, tryd drying it out and drying off , BROKEN HAD TO SEND back to company and Here it is 3 weeks later and no sign of my detector and no email from company like they told me they were going to do , empty claims from bounty hunter."
4,enjoyable,"So far we have enjoyed our Bounty Hunter. We haven't found anything huge in value yet because its pretty wet and cold right now, but my boys did find a metal frame to a mini-bike.Anyway, we are looking forward to when it warms up and being able to find more goodies. No real disappointments on this. It is my first metal detector, but so far pretty easy to use and does what it says."
4,fun product,Bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. We have both enjoyed using it around our property. Looking forward to taking it out and about when the weather improves. Good sensitivity. Light and easy to operate.
3,good start,I purchsed this for our last trip to the beach. The fact that it was waterproof was a big plus. The only problem was that no matter what setting we contunied to find aluminum cans and pull tops. I guess you get what you pay for and for the price it was still fun for the kids. I will definately be buying a better model next time that can be set to pick up certain metals and not others.
2,Great Starter,"This is an inexpensive starter detector, If you would seriously like to detect, I would recommend you purchase a bit more expensive detector. Would be great for a child."
3,Bounty Hunter TK4 IV Metal Detector,Please do not consider this a very accurate review because I'm a novice. I'm still pursuing getting the most from this detector. The operation is simple. I plan to get more practice and enjoy it more. I just wish there were more instructional videos on this model online.
3,Starter model to grow out of...,Sensitivity is measured in two dimensions - this model works on the surface but lacks sensitivity below ground.
5,Katha Upanishad is one of the most interesting Upanishads.,"Katha Upanishad deals with Death and the hereafter, so it deals actually with life. The young boy Naciketas is sent by his father to Death's abode. Yama , the god of death, confers upon him 3 boons - the safe return to Earth and warm welcome by his father, the secret of the fire sacrifice that leads to Heaven, the secret of death and the way to overcome it. Most of the book is dedicated to the doctrine of Yama - the new teachings of the Upanishads about the identity of the human soul with the universal Absolute, the identity of Atman and Brahman. Yoga is first mentioned in this book as the means to achieve the highest knowledge, that frees man from the bondage of Samsara and repeated births and deaths."
3,Good for everyone.,"These ore the ""old reliable"" strings. Great for beginners and the traveler. Inexpensive and easy to pluck. Buy five sets for everyday use."
3,Display issue,"This camera is great, only problem is, that almost immediately, two vertical lines appeared on the display. Another line appeared a few days after that. It makes no difference to the recording, but I am afraid that after a while I will not see what's on the display. I bought this for my dad and were able to give it to him after a few month so now I am wondering if I get any warranty help from JVC."
1,Video format difficult to edit,"I bought this camcorder about a year ago and haven't used it much... just been taking video here and there. Now I'm ready to do some editing and the file format it records to, .MOD is not recognized by any program except the lame video editing program it comes with. I have Adobe Premiere CS3 with the latest update and it still doesn't work. There are programs out there for converting the files, I've tried one, it's a pain, and I still can't get the audio to work with the video.Don't just take my word for it, google .MOD and JVC and see what everyone else is saying."
2,not worth the money,I bought this camcorder last week as a replacement to our existing one that we have had for 3 years. I was very disapointed with the quality of picture at night or low light conditions. The picture quality during the day was par at best. I hooked it up to the docking station and it did not work. I had to plug it into the camara direct. I also had some errors while recording and it prompted me to do some repair. I pushed a couple of buttons and it seemed to correct itself. The software that it came with is hard to figure out. The only pro is 7 hours of record time. I am probably going to return it.
4,"By far, the best hard disk camcorder I have tried","After many failed previews, attempts, and returns of other brands, we are having a great experience with this camcorder. It is easy to use, and does the job others can't in low light. The night enhanced function is jumpy like all the others, but this camera takes good bright video without it. There are numerous helpful functions as well. I was disapointed that the extra long battery pack seems to require a supplied jumper wire to function, but the battery lasted almost three hours, which is a value no matter what the oddities. The flash works well, but the light seems like a ""toy"" feature that wasn't worth the extra money over the model without it. I hope you enjoy one of these cameras. The others have a long way to go to catch this one."
4,"I like this Camcorder, It does very well.","This is a great product. It does not do well in a small space you need at least 15 feet distance to shoot your video. Aside from that minor inconvenience, it is a terrific product.Scott Doerr"
4,Basia - please make more music!!!,"When I first heard the melodies emanating from my radio back in the late 1980's that eventually became associated with Basia, I thought I had died and gone to Richard Rogers/Leroy Anderson/Tom Jobim Jazz/Broadway/Latin rock Heaven (if there is such a convoluted place!)This collection of three of her five albums (and don't forget Danny White's input!) will satisfy the curious but fail to fulfill the devoted who know there is more out there, thus failing to complete the picture. Still, since this collection is made available it propels the hope to the surface held by ALL Basia afficianados that the market exists for more product, and that someday SOON she and Danny will again collaborate for a new album."
5,"Who's in Charge of the Links, here anyway?","I've had this disc on vinyl for about 30 years and it is one of the best so I really only have a couple questions.1. Why does the mp3 store purchase link take me to a Bloodwyn Pig album?2. Why is a review of that album on this page?Otherwise Marscape is a fantastic album. It was a side project of most of the talent from Brand X including Phil Collins (back in the days when he cared about music), Percy Jones and John Goodsall. If you like Brand X's first 3 albums you will enjoy Marscape just as much."
2,"Not to be confused with the original ""AHEAD RINGS OUT"" (1969)","These are re-recordings.They're OK.But the best and most enduring recordings of these songs ison the original ""Ahead Rings Out"" album,released in 1969, which is, simply put, wonderful.If you're used to listening to ""Ahead Rings Out"",you'd be best to get the original (re-released) CD.While we're at it, this band had a pretty solid2nd album, as I remember. Wonder what happened to that?"
1,REALLY BAD QUALITY,"I purchased these shoes about 2 months ago. My 5-year old son wears them 3 days per week. About 1 month into it, the entire black layer started peeling off - it's not like the paint is scratched or scraped, which is fine and normal, the ENTIRE BLACK LAYER of the shoes at the toes and around the ankles started peeling off. The laces, too!!! I have never seen the black paint (or whatever it is) of laces peel. The quality of these shoes is awful. The worst thing I have seen. I wouldn't even buy them for $5.00, let alone $50.00. What a rip-off!"
2,Wobbly and doesn't close flat,"This is not the most sturdiest step stool out there. Definitely a bit rickety, but does the job. The step stool I was sent doesn't close flat which was one of the main reasons I considered buying this step stool in the first place. Either I got a really bad model, or they're all like this."
5,Volar sobre el pantano (Spanish Edition) by Carlos Cuauhtemoc Sanchez.,"Nada es gratis en la vida, estudia preparate, planea tu vida y si te molestan riete de ellos. Tienes derecho a no caerles bien a todos, entiendelo como un derecho.Aprende esta frase de memoria: Nunca te amara nadie si no eres capaz de correr el riesgo de k algunos te aborrezcan."
4,Interesting,"This volume of articles and tidbits about the great Jackie Chan is definitely worth a read if not great. There are many fine insights into the man and the legend Jackie Chan, and indeed a lot of interesting photographs, which makes it so much the more enjoyable.The format of the book, however, does not really agree with me. I don't like the article form, it seems cheap and mean. In my opinion it would have been better to write a uniform, coherent text based on the interviews and articles instead. The information is still there, it just seems a bit disorganized (which it really is not, it just seems that way).It is still highly recommendable for all the information in there. Sure to please any fan."
1,Waste of money and time!,This is probably the worst soccer instructional DVD that I've ever seen (and I've watched quite a few). More time is spent on David talking about David than on instruction. Content is light and production is glitzy and distracting.
4,"Very entertaining, a little short on substance.",The entertainment factor gets kids watching it - the only coaching or skills DVD they'll watch and then go out and practice the skills on their own. That's a big plus. I've also showed the skills on a TV when we've had to do indoor practice and then have the team repeat the skill. It's worked O.K. It demonstrates a lot of good basic skills any footballer should have but there's a lot more that David could teach and have the kids listen to and learn. (When is part 2 coming out?) I do like where after they demonstrate a skill they show a clip from a professional game of a player using that skill. Other skill DVDs should learn from this. It's also very strong in the way the skill is demonstrated by David and then having a group of kids repeat the skill. Its also fun hearing David's answers to the kids' questions.
4,No yawns here,"As a s soccer coach's wife, I get to watch alot of ""how to"" soccer videos. This one was very interesting to watch. Then again, it is Beckham we're talking about."
1,HIghly polished waste of time,"Beckham is one of the great soccer players of today and I was really looking forward to his hints on how to do things, especially since this is a 2 DVD package.I was most interested in the ""banana kick"" which is how most people call the kick that bends the ball around say an opposing ""wall."" Not here. Almost nothing is here except a lot of special effects, and ""extras"" like some shots of the face of the Great One looking worried as he gets ready to do a penalty kick. There is a little 20 minutes or so of a game of the Great One vs a bunch of young kids but nothing to learn there.The only saving grace of this is the points on ""first touch"" which are pretty good.There are a very few pointers for beginners on how to get past an opponent but nothing any 9 year old can't figure out for him/herself.So much sizzle, so little steak!"
1,Save your money,This book is more of a info & stat recap than a restoration guide & some of the stats are even wrong.
2,Awful.,"Do you hate the world? Do you see the glass as 1/10 empty? Do you want to commit suicide? If the answer to any of these questions is yes, then read this book. It is dark, depressing, utterly awful. I have never heard so much whining in a single book in my entire life. I give it 2 thumbs down."
2,"Too Mushy, Too Crunchy","This reminded me of Toffee Crisp -- but gone wrong. This is a very weird chocolate bar that I did not enjoy. None of the flavors are wrong. It's just that I did not enjoy how it felt in my mouth. Inside of the Decker's chocolate sheath is a layer of a chocolate marshmallow-like fluff, and some hard cereal mixed with chocolate creme. I found that these do not match. It's an odd mix. I feel like I'm eating somewhat tasty poo."
4,Modern idealism for the African American Culture,"Kevin Gaines does a remarkable job in identify the problems that face many African Americans living in the Twentieth Century. His studies is focused around the Civil Right Era where you have powerful leaders involved with the ""Black Freedom Movement."" Noted key players are Malcolm X and Marcus Garvey. His arguements are based around the problems in the South and the violation of civil and human rights. The Federal and local (Southern) governments are the key institutions that supported the unjust treatment of African Americans for over many centuries. Gaines seem to argue that if there is a change in the way politics are incorporated in the poor black communities to help build a middle/working class society then the poverty rate would decrease and race would not be a barrier."
2,NOT a punch bowl,"Contrary to the product description, this item cannot be inverted to become a punch bowl, which was the primary reason that I chose it. It does have a fairly simple design that I found appealing but it would have been nice to get an accurate description. I agree with the previous post that it's not worth sending it back; I would but for the postage!"
4,"""America""- Pristine Vocals and Smooth Arrangements","By the time this album was released, it had been years since Karen and Richard had a bonafide hit. They tried hard to remedy that- and suceeded, for the most part. The first radio single ""Touch Me When We're Dancing"" shimmers. It represents the best of the duo: warm, tender vocals; understated arrangement and lyrics of yearning for love. A wiser, more mature Karen emerges on ""Strength of A Woman"", but she lets her wandering man come home. The forgotten single of 1978, ""I Believe You"" shows the power behind the voice. The heartbreaking lyrics and sensational arrangement make for an instant classic. The only misstep on the album is a limp remake of ""Beechwood 4-5789"", an obvious attempt to remake the success of ""Please Mr. Postman"". Karen was no longer sweet sixteen, but a woman of 31, and overall this collection shows why she was the best of her generation, and of those before or after."
1,"Buy cheap, you get cheap","They say ""You get what you pay for"" and this is certainly true of the 12"" turntable (10805) from Stacks and Stacks. It barely turns when it's empty and it doesn't turn at all if you add several items to it. I planned to use it to organize canned goods. No way! This turntable is useless. You can return it to the company at your expense using Fedex or UPS and insured, so it will probably cost you as much to return the turntable as it did to order it in the first place. I have bought other turntables that turn freely loaded to the hilt so I know a decent turntable is produced. It's not this one!"
5,These are individual serving size,"This mini says clearly in the description that it is 2 3/4 inches high. You can by them from Staub, Apilco and others if you need cheaper ones. These perform better in fast and even heating, in water baths or in ovens. You can freeze them. They also might appeal to those who prefer to bring gleaming copper to the table.These are not toys or decorations or ""curiosities"". They are expensive to build. They are worth the higher price if you want exacting results, particularly if you use them frequently. Otherwise you can certainly get by just fine with ceramics as mentioned above."
2,Too Small,This is for puppies the bag is super small!!!The bag didn't last more than a day. I thought it was funny when I got the bag I thought it was a gift to be honest!!!
5,One of my top albums,"We saw them live the first time I heard them and I was blown away, and then I bought the cd and I fell in love. They are some of the true songwriters left around today. You can feel what they are singing about, if you buy this you will not regret it."
5,Superb!,"Fantastic skill is demonstrated in this wonderful collection of original works. Peaceful and emotional, this CD has earned a spot in my ""go to"" library. I highly recommend this CD to those wishing to experience true fingerstyle guitar talent. Can't wait to hear your next CD!"
4,Fast Tracker,"I purchased two of these metal detectors for myself and my 8 year old daughter. We have used them approximately 3 times, and I have not been disappointed. Easy to use right out of the box. We could use more practice to determine if what we have found is junk or treasure. I have used at beach, though I have heard that these are not equipped for heavy beach scouting. I have also used at playgrounds. It is lightweight, and somewhat easy to handle. One key: get a comfortalbe pair of headphones that will stay in place and easy to get off and on as you will need to remove them frequently to dig. Overall, I am very satisfied."
2,Expected more of this product,Two of the three Bounty Hunter Fast Tracker metal detectors that I received were defective. One of them made a noise when the batteries were first connected but would not respond after the batteries were inserted into their compartment. The other never responded at all. All the batteries were tested to be at or above their expected voltage range. It would have helped a great deal if the factory would test each unit prior to shipment. Amazon did handle the exchanges promptly.
1,HORRIBLE BAIT AND SWITCH,"I ordered a metal detector....Amazon sent an email confirming that....this company then emailed me to say I ordered lip shimmer.....no, no I did not. I sent the seller an email stating as such, no response. Tried again, no response. What do I get in the mail today....yep, $12 lip shimmer that ironically is Burt's Bees and has a $4.99 price tag on it. ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE"
2,Not So Great,"Purchased this item as a birthday present for my grandson. Product is easy to assemble and operate, but it does not do well with non-ferrous items. I salted an Eisenhower Dollar near a boundary pin for which I knew the approximate location. My grandson found the boundary pin with no trouble at all, but the Dollar is still out there. Went out there myself with the detector and tried with various settings and combinations of sensitivity and discrimination. Absolutely no luck. Maybe a squirrel got to it first? :-)"
3,Works,"I wish it was more sensitive, but it does work - sometimes it will pass over something without beeping and seems like it needs a little kick in the butt, so it is a good idea to bring a coin along to test it and keep it active - the more I have used it the better it seems to work, witch is a good sign."
1,Bait and Switch Beware!!,"This Item was advertised for 4.99. I knew it was too good to be true but I went for it anyway. I thought it was a surplus or clearance or something. However when I received a confirmation for Lip gloss and jewelry I knew something was messed up. My credit card has not been charged and the order canceled, but it is still disappointing."
3,Used the detector while on VAC in Sept 2011,The Bounty Hunter was very easy to put together and fairly easy to figure out how to use. I did do as instructions suggested and laid examples like nails/coins etc in my backyard before using the metal detector at the Beach.Although I didnt find anything after using the metal detector 5 times at 3 different Beach locations while I was on VAC I was glad I had it with me since it helped pass the time while my wife read her book on the beach.The only other suggestion I would have is to do as I did and periodically check the metal detectors readings or lack there of by pointing it at either a coin in my hand or in my pocketIts a nice beginners tool/toy
4,John Mayer continues in the same vein,"This album in its six songs is a good addition for any John Mayer fan. With an acoustic background, Mayers voice shines. Very similiar to Donovan Frankenreiter - the songs bubble right underneath the Pop surface with their composition, but listening to the lyrics reveals more depth."
3,short,"I'm a Fan of John mayer but this item is just a form to make easy money, just 6 songs easy to do for him and easy to sale to all his fans that are waiting some new of John mayer.To me, is just a marketing product but less quality than the others albums of john mayer incluidiny the first one without a serious discography.Sorry for my english..."
5,Phenomemal!!!,"I am a huge fan of John Mayer and own all of his cds/dvds and I am now a proud owner of ""The Village Sessions""!!! I would definately recommend this album to anyone who is interested in listening to accoustic versions of some of John Mayer's greatest hits!!!! LOVE IT!!"
5,"Great, different sound!","Purchasing this CD after already having the major record labled, Continuum, was an excellent choice! Listening to these songs acoustically truly gives them all a different sound - feels like you're in a coffee shop listening to John Mayer with only about 20 people in the room! A must have for any John Mayer fan!"
5,good,"let's see, a bit pricey for a mere six tracks, but honestly, john mayer is really good at what he does and this disc is worth it. Mayer's acoustic is just as good as his regular cuts if not better and who doesn't love ""waiting on the world to change"" with a drop of ben harper?"
5,"ONE OF THE BEST OF JOHN MAYER, EXCELLENT CD!!","IF YOU LIKE JOHN MAYER, THIS IS ONE PIECE YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE.GREAT CD, 100% RECOMMENDED"
5,Nice to see talent in today's music scene,"I must admit that when John first appeared with album # 1 a few years back I said to myself ""here we go again, another pretty boy with no musical substance"". Since then, I have been proven wrong and become a fan. In addition, I must applaud him for being so ambitious. He's released alot of music and covered alot of ground in 5 years. Although I wasn't crazy about the trio record (he ain't Hendrix or SRV even though he is a huge fan of both), the Continuum album really brought me around. Most of the songs are on the mellow side but still are great! This EP contains acoustic stripped down versions of some of those songs and is priced well so I would advise anyone who likes his current album to pick this up as a companion piece."
4,John brings new light to his new songs...,"I've always loved the way John Mayer takes his songs to the acoustic side of things and this album highlights that talent. The songs have a different feel to them. They don't sound as deep and emotional as the full orchestrated Continuum versions, but (with the exception of Waiting on the world to Change - which sounds identical to the Continuum version) both Belief and Slow Dancing (the two strongest on this album) have a more personal sound to them.The production is spotless and it sounds as though the album was recorded in the studio as opposed to live, and result is a definite additon to your John Mayer collection.The only fault I have is that there isn't a longer track listing."
4,Breathtaking acoustic sound,"Great stuff from John Mayer and his musicians, especially guitarist John McIntosh. Clean and tight production, yet personal and ""close"" as acoustic sessions should be. This also features Ben Harper on ""Waiting on the world to change"", his contribute makes it almost sound gospel-ish. Nice! If you're a John Mayer or Eric Clapton-fan, this is a record for you. PS: ""Belief"" and ""Slow dancing in a burning room"" sound like heaven acoustically."
5,MMMMMONSTER HIT!,"I love this game! This is probably the best multiplayer shooter ever! The guns are great (go Redeemer!), the levels are amazing (I love Facing Worlds), and the graphics are A1. The pace is the game is very fast, and you must constantly be ready to defend yourself, or attack, whichever comes first. The modes are great. Assault is a great original creation. You must take over an enemy's base in a certain amount of time, then you must defend that same base, and the enemy has to take it over quicker than it took you. The only problem is that there are too few levels, but the ones that we have are great, including the Normandy beach level. This game will have you hooked forever."
5,The best bloody game ever...,If you like body explosion or when you shot someone in a game you like to see the blood comming out of the body... You will love this game...
4,Great Game,"I just got this game, and frankly I think its pretty darn good. Fun single player, great multiplayer! Best of all, it needs NO 3D HARDWARE. However, I found 2 flaws with this game:1. Its a serious memory hog2. Where is Tactical Ops? Its one of the main reasons I bought this game, and this feature seems to be nonexistent! I looked into this, and Tactical Ops is only in the beta 2 phase! Don't buy this game for Tactical Ops. I would give this game 5 stars were it not for this dissappointing empty promise......"
4,One of the greatest MULTIPLAYER GAMES ever,"I love this game. It is truly a great game, but there was one big problem with it. The game was basically one big multiplayer game. The only exception is Assault where you have to achieve certain objectives to move on and conquer the other teams base. Although this might disappoint some true fans of UT I prefer Halo over this game. The multiplayer in Halo is almost the same although I love in UT how you can download infinite ammounts of modifications (like new weapons, levels, characters, modes, etc.) which make the game never boring. Here's how it goes. Also I loved the weapons in this game. The alternate fire is really coo. It's fun to find out which gun to use and figure out what to do with it in certain situations. If you want a strong 1 player mode stick with the Wolfensteins and Medal of Honors, but you should definitely buy this game no matter what."
1,Beware the MP3s!,"I bought the first few mp3s from this CD and the audio quality was awful. They had a hissing sibilance all the way through, and the volume was so low I had to turn my mp3 player all the way up--and it still wasn't loud enough! (I was listening on headphones.) Needless to say, I didn't buy the rest of the files. Bad job, Amazon!"
3,It's not very good,"The remixes are not good. I thought the Tood Terry's mixes could be nice, but this time it wasn't like this."
3,good perspective; too few details,"5 stars to Ingrid for being so direct with issues that are rarely discussed in the church. ...But 3 stars because I kept asking ""why?"" She doesn't go into detail about some things; doesn't back up others with statistics/examples/facts. I was confused on the chapter about the natural family planning. I didn't think she explained it very clearly. I had to look up more information elsewhere because I was confused about what she was saying. I went to hear her speak and I got even more confused by the charts she gave us...But it's a decent book if you are looking for a Christian perspective. I think she has another one called ""An Experience of Love"" (which is out of print) which contains readers' letters and the answers to them."
3,Keep out of reach of children,"This astonishing filth is definitely not for the puritans. In fact, it is not for anyone who is easily shocked by references to extramarital sexuality. The plot has the sophistication of a bad porn film, but the exquisite detail of its S&M; scenes may well rival Marquis de Sade. The repetitiveness of this book makes it unlikely that you will get past page 30 without getting bored. Nevertheless, its filth is so unrestrained that it's worth reading for educational purposes, if nothing else.Oh, and to set the record straight - I was given this book as a joke by a friend :)"
5,perfect!,"These are exactly as pictured, and they came shipped well packed in styrofoam so they arrived in tact. Lovely addition to our wedding."
4,Fundamentals of Algebra and Trigonometry,"I have been amazed at the quality of used text books from Amazon. They always come as promised with very little markings (when described as very good) and the price beats new hands down. I was afraid we were going to get a very damaged book with too many markings to be useful, and was pleasantly surprised."
4,"If you can accept that this is a parody, it's very enjoyable","Although this is nowhere near as side-splittingly wonderful (or as useful) asHow Not to Write a Novel, it's still an amusing, chuckle-worthy parody of the genre of ""writing advice"" books. Middle-grade humor (by which I mean quality, not age) I guess."
1,Not What It Appears To Be,"I gave this book one star because you can't give no stars. Like other reviewers, I am taking this book back to the store. It's not a book of writing exercises and writing advice, but a satire of such books. If you want a laugh, read it in the coffee shop of the bookstore and put it back. Don't buy it."
5,Great!,"I absolutely loved this book! It is possibly the best writing book I've yet to read. I started laughing right at the dedication and kept on until the last page. Finally someone who's not afraid to make fun of writing, which is, by far, scarier than telling a tatooed biker that his motorcycle reminds you of your kid sister's tricycle. It's a must read for anyone who may think that writing is only a cut-and-dry uphill struggle. (Pick up ""Robert's Rules of Writing"" while you're at it.)"
5,Fabulous!,"People must have thought I was losing my mind, as they passed while I was reading this book to pass some time before work. I was laughing so hard I had to purchase it; its a valuable must have for my ""writing reference"" collection.While all the advice is to be taken with a shaker full of salt, this book was wonderfully helpful. It reminded me not to take myself so seriously all the time; writing is meant to be fun and I've let it become too much of a chore. I know I'll be flipping back through this one every time I need a good laugh or a little tongue-in-cheek advice!"
2,The Cult of McSweeney's skunks me again.,"John Warner, Fondling Your Muse (Writer's Digest, 2005)I was unaware, until faced with the cover of this book, that Warner was the editor of McSweeney's, and as soon as I saw that, I had a good idea of what to expect. Warner didn't disappoint me; the book is mildly amusing at times, but never anywhere near as funny as it thinks it is, full of annoying political snipes that have nothing at all to do with anything, and easily forgettable. In other words, a lot like McSweeney's itself.That said, buried beneath the satire there could well be a pretty good how-to book. A lot of Warner's core advice (or the opposite of a lot of Warner's core advice, depending on the topic) is sound. Naturally, there's nothing you haven't seen before, but then, when was the last time you picked up a writing book that had anything truly original to say?A little more consistency and a better sense of humor and I'd have recommended this. **"
3,Very Funny...BUT Don't Buy it If You Really Want a Book on Writing,"I admit to buying and reading way too many books on writing instead of actually writing. And this book pokes at people like me unmercifully...It is the Anti-Reading-Books-on-Writing book...One of the cleverest things I've read in it (so far) is Warner's ""recipes"" for best sellers...the Ayn Rand recipe made me chortle like a crazed monkey.It is very funny and the author's voice almost carries it off. (I did notice he ""appropriates"" (read: steals) from the best, including Al Franken and John Kennedy Toole.)But if you're really looking for a book on writing, this isn't the one you want.I am getting my revenge, though. I am reading it at my local B&N.; I won't go so far as to spill coffee on it, though.And if you want to get that reference, pick up the book (at your local bookstore with a cafe) and read the introduction..."
1,Why Did I think this would be good?,"I had such high hopes for deep and meaningful messages to be revealed within the pages of this text. I have no idea why - the Title must have spoken to me on some other level...In the end, this book was just a long, drawn out, Thank You note to all the people who have helped to build the Kathy Ireland Empire.Although its very nice of her to ""write this note"" its not something any of us who are not mentioned in the book, need to read. Save your money and move on to something truly inspirational.Thankfully, my copy only cost me 99 cents - maybe that should have been a clue!!!!"
1,"another celeb sharing ""knowledge""","I can't imagine anything more arrogant than a celebrity sharing her ""wisdom and experiences"" and telling the everyday person how he or she should live. This a woman who has been a supermodel/actress since she was a teenager. She's traveled the world and made ungodly amounts of money off of her looks. She's married to a doctor and lives in a mansion. Her whole life has been paved with privilege and artifice. Now, she thinks she can tell the average person how to have a more meaningful and fulfilling life? Sorry, I think before anyone else can do that for me, he or she should walk a mile in my shoes... and not on the runway!!"
4,Food Analysis text - as described,"Some errors in calculations in Chapter 4, but otherwise a very good, thorough text on Food Analysis techniques and processes."
2,academic manual,"This is an instructor's manual for a college-level course. If you're looking for something of general interest, such as a calorie-counting book, this is not for you. Table of contents includes government regulations and standards, compositional analysis and chemical properties, spectroscopy, chromatography, and physical properties of foods. Chapter 1 starts with multiple choice questions that refer to pages in another text."
1,food analysis,"dear sirs, as a matter of fact ,we need to know if this book is usefull for processing of potato chips and can this book help us for using a better technology for oil consumption in our production.since we are researching on how we can reduce oil in potato chips."
4,"Manners, etiquette, style made accessible. Geared to young adults.","Essentially a 'Mister-Manners' for younger people. Small accessible book... Easily assimilated advice intended to communicate the value and purpose of manners... Served up with Bentley's dash of style. (Remember the famous pic of Fonsworth (Fonzworth) Bentley holding umbrella over P. Diddy? Of the two, guess who had more pzazz!!!)A few full-term adults could benefit from Bentley's advice as well!Perfect for this graceless age. At least it's encouraging to see that such a book exists.Only complaint: Maybe a little too simplistic at times."
1,Advance Your Swagger:,"Not at all what I expected. Seemed to be more common sense, unless the reader would be a complete novice in the use of manners. Returning for credit."
2,Advance Your Swagger,"I bought this book for my 14 year old son in January, who is on the brink of manhood. It entertained him and his sister for about a half a day. I have not seen him look at it again as a point of reference, which was my hope. I did, however, overhear him and his sister discussing table ettiquette a few days after reading this guide."
4,Advance Your Swagger,This book is awesome i wish it was more information i started reading it and i couldn't put it down until i finished the whole book.
5,Wonderfully delightful,I think this is a book every adult without the proper etiquette training and manners should have.
1,This movie is like a rock hitting you in the head or in the eye,"Should there ever be a class of worse movies this movie will score the number one position. A 'no star' rating is too good for this movie. Luckily I saw it on DVD, so I fast forwarded through the whole thing. My eyes and ears found my action extremely commendable. I wish I had read the reviews before I picked up this piece of trash in the movie store. As soon as I am through writing this review I am going to break the DVD."
3,Pretty Good,"I like these insoles, but was hoping for something a with a few more bumps. I wanted more of a cobblestone feel. These are good for pressure points though. I wanted to feel a slight ""discomfort"", and they provided that."
1,More like chinese torture than massage,I am sorry but whoever designed these things should be forced to wear them every day as punishment. They are horrible. they are nothing but pieces of flat plastic with a few metal studs inserted in them. They are very uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time and instead of massaging your feet they hurt them. Please avoid these product.
3,Stallone's (generally unnoticed) comeback.,"You can read about the actual plot of the movie in a thousand different places, so I won't bother, but for anyone disappointed by Sylvester Stallone's last two efforts (Driven, Get Carter), this is a step in the right direction for my favorite movie star. But forget about the corny one-liners and impossible physical feats that we may have seen 10-15 years ago from Sly. While this movie has action, it's definitely a thriller movie that could even pass as horror. Many scenes are gruesome and violent. This is a good, solid movie that blows away his past two releases, yet is nothing like anything he has ever done. If you're a Stallone fan, you're going to like this movie. And even if you're not, it's still enjoyable for anyone who likes a good thriller."
1,How the mighty have fallen!,"First of all, i want to say that i was a stallone fan for many years but sadly his decisions(apparently deciding to retire from action films and refusing a 20 million dollar paycheck)after the great 1996 film DAYLIGHT left somewhat to be desired.Stallone was a great action hero and i looked forward to his high profile movies(usually 2 each year)but now stallone is just a shadow of himself and his latest films have not been up to pass quality and standards.After viewing this EYE SEE YOU film,its not at all hard to understand why it was on the self for so long.Finished in 1999,it was only released outside the important usa/canada market in ....2002!This is simply a sad piece of violent filmmaking with very few bright spots which truely deserved to be unsuccessful and its another faux pas in stallone s career."
2,Yo Adrian! Dere's a killer on da loose!,"Another thriller/ slash trash movie from the director of I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER and starring Hollywood's greatest method actor Sylvester ""Wam ham slam!"" Stallone.After his wife is brutally slain by a psychotic driller killer, FBI agent Sly attends a Detox center for burnt out action heroes... uh, I mean cops; which just happens to be located in a remote mountain area. Predictably they get snowed in and after other patients start getting murdered, Sly comes to the brilliant conclusion that there is a maniac loose in the center. D-TOX is a lot better than DRIVEN but there's still awful dialogue. ie. Cop to Sly: ""Whatsa matter Malloy?, ya used to be one of us before you became a Fed"". There is also an impaling scene stolen directly from Stallone's CLIFFHANGER. But dat's jist some DAY-ZHA-VOO know what I'm sayin'? Still, things could be worse. At least he hasn't made ROCKY 6... yet."
3,Hey this was actually a good movie!,"Why has this movie gotten such a bad rap?! I enjoyed this film. The last three movies I have seen are ""XXX"" and ""Blood Work"", and this movie. Of the three ""Eye See You"" was by far the best movie! It is a shame that this did not make it into theatres. this is Stallones best film in a long time. ""Driven"" and ""Get Cater"" are Stallone movies that deserved the straight to video route but not this! This movie is not a msaterpiece but it is a good movie and totally enjoyable. I recommend Stallone fans check this one out. Although I must say there is one laughable scene, its when he is having a nightmare, you will know what I am talking about when you see it, and I hope you do take the time to check it out."
3,NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES,"THE INFO ON THE BACK OF THE PACKAGING CLEARLY STATES ENGLISH SUBTITLES.HOWEVER, THERE ARE NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES ON THE DISC THAT CAME IN MY PACK.SONY HAS NOT RESPONDED TO MY INQUIRY. PEOPLE THAT HAVE HEARING DIFFICULTY WOULD LIKE TO ENJOY MOVIES TOO!3 STARS FOR STALLONE! 0 FOR SONY!"
1,Awful,"Standard acting school setup: a bunch of characters in a confined space with clashing personalities. Cherchez la femme except ""la femme"" is a serial killer. Hero driven by the loss of his one true love to avenge and save another woman.Try watching with the sound off to fully appreciate what a low-budget, dismally written, ... just bad movie this is."
2,PREDICTABLE THRILLER...NOT STALLONE'S FINEST HOUR!,"I never heard of this Stallone film before and after watching it, I can see why. The film is very predictable and the excellent cast is way too good for such a dumb movie. The film's running time is just over an hour and a half, but it feels like an eternity. There are just too many better films of this kind to waste your time with this one, but if your a thriller junky or Stallone fan, you'll probably like it more than I did."
3,good movie,"Good thrill movie with good actors. Stallone looks much younger than he was in Rocky 5. No nudity just violents/killings. Most of the story happened at the same complex, low cost production? or they spent most of the money on the cast! The ending can be better though."
3,"A well crafted suspense movie, just creepy enough","3 of 5 stars for the cop-killing psycho suspense movie Eye See You. When I first read the product description I thought that this would be a great movie. Then I put it into the DVD player thinking oh this wasn't going to be good. Well, I watched it and decided it was actually good. So, we have Stallone in the role of a cop trying to track down a cop killer. Early-on the psycho goes after Stallone's family. That pushes his character into serious mental problems for which he needs help at a remote snow-covered group hospital in the middle of nowhere. The hospital specializes in helping cops with problems (drinking, drugs, mind). So rather than spoil it, let's just say this becomes a good creepy suspense movie.Very interesting settings for the hospital. Well acted. Stallone showed good maturity as an actor by not over-powering te movie or other charaters. Well made suspense movie. Worth watching and I do recommend it."
2,Eye Know What You Did Last Winter,"First, the good points: Excellent performances by Stallone and Robert Patrick; able supporting cast; offbeat, interesting setting; good production values.Now, the bad points: Everything else. The story never quite gels; the sound level on much of the dialog is extremely low; the violence is overly gruesome yet at the same time unaffecting; the net result is basically unbelieveable and therefore lacking any real suspense.It seems like there should be a much better movie here somwhere, but it just never shows up.It's clear why this was never released theatrically in the United States."
1,Please let me give this movie Zero Stars!,"I suffered, and I DO mean suffered, through this atrocity only for the sake of seeing Jeffrey Wright. This movie was horrible - save Jeffrey's scenes - from beginning to the who-knows-what-happened or who cared ending! Ugh. What a waste of 90 minutes of your life. Stay far, far away from this mess. Not only do you not care who the killer is, all you do is sit and pray for it to be over. And, I like Stallone."
2,"Avid Stallone Fan, but...","...this movie really stunk. I'm keeping it, though, because I am a huge Stallone fan."
5,Arctic Blast...,"After losing his girlfriend (Dina Meyer from STARSHIP TROOPERS, SAW 2 and 3) to a vengeful serial killer, FBI agent Malloy (Sylvester Stallone) becomes suicidal. Helped by a cop / friend (Charles S. Dutton from GOTHIKA and MIMIC), Malloy ends up at a rehab facility in the middle of wild Wyoming. A group of other cops are there for rehab as well, including a hard-boiled SWAT officer (Robert Patrick from TERMINATOR 2 and TV's X-FILES) and others. The head doctor is played by Kris Kristofferson (PAYBACK and THE JACKET). Unfortunately for Malloy and his fellow patients, it seems that someone might not be who they are supposed to be. Then, people begin dying in mysterious ways! With it's desolate, isolated location, blizzard conditions, rampant paranoia, and a murderer on the loose, EYE SEE YOU takes on elements of movies like THE SHINING and THE THING, combined w/ an ""old dark house"" atmosphere. A superb thriller / suspense story w/ horror trappings. Highly recommended..."
5,Great collection for anybody who wants to get IG early albums,"I don't think you can get the 3 albums in this collection seperately anymore, so this is the only way to get what I consider one of their best of the best albums of their long career-Nomads, Indians, Saints. So much good stuff on that album, but the 2 earlier albums are also worthy of ownership. It is fun to listen to what is going on musically from album to album and see just how far the girls have come. The early 2 albums are primarily 2 girls with guitars then they got picked up by Sony/Epic and began their longstanding career with them. The difference shows in the production of the albums. Not that the 2 earlier were bad, just not quite as good production wise as NIS. Very good collection to get started with if you are just getting into the girls."
2,Was this necessary,"Usually box sets span the entire career of an band. This is just three so-so albums packaged in a cute little wrapper. I've given up hope on them long ago, hopefully a greatest hits will be coming soon."
4,Carpenters Remastered,"No doubt this album is filled with many classic songs that are wonderfully produced and remastered. When played on high resolving audio systems, this cd is digital and is not as well recorded as the import release of ""As Time Goes By."" I have awarded this album four stars based on the content, production, and talent of the performers!"
1,"Song for you, Carpenters (red album cover)","I thought I was ordering a CD...turns out it was an old size record, 33 1/3, and I have nothing to play this on. Ad was confusing. NOt happy with this!"
3,Get creative,I love the flag! BUT the suction cup that you're suppose to hang it up with is useless and so is the string it's on! It's way too short and I can't stretch it to fit over my mirror. I had to find string from around the hOuse and replace it to make it longer
4,Great prep material,"I recently took the SPHR and used this book as the main source for my preparation. I passed and would recommend this book to anyone. Please keep in mind no one source is absolutely complete so you still have to do outside research and study. However, this book does a good job of bring the core skills together."
4,A Good Resource,"This book was extremely helpful in preparing me for my PHR exam. SHRM offers a lot of classes and expensive training options, but with my work experience and this book as a study guide, I was able to successfully pass the exam on my first try. If nothing else, it's a good, inexpensive reference tool that I've utilized on many occasions."
5,Excellent Guide,This book helped me pass the certification test! Its a great guide that explained everything I needed to know.
2,You get what you pay for...so get the SHRM books!,"This book has a minimal amount of study information, but had some handy sample tests. If you want to pass the exam for sure, you should get the books through SHRM/HRCI. I got them for a discount through my local chapter, along with a 12 week study course."
3,Very resourceful book,"I took the SPHR exam in June 2004 and passed, with the help of this book most definitely. In order to pass the exam, I highly recommend using numerous resources, because HRCI uses different terms that may not be found in any one book/resource. I used this book as a primer, and also used the SHRM Learning System, along with HR Management by Mathis, and began studying 6 months prior to the test date. This is a valuable book, and the test questions were helpful, but don't think that this book is the one and only resource that will help you pass the exam, because it won't suffice on its own. Another helpful hint: the practice questions in this book (and the practice questions in the SHRM Learning System) are MUCH easier than most of the questions on the exam, so be prepared!"
5,PHR Certification Guide for HRCI exam,I passed the test and I have no working experience in HR. I read SHRM modules and did the study group. What really helped me was Anne B book - it all came together for me in this book. She is a wealth of HR information and its very current. She ties everything together so you get the full picture of HR and its relevance in business.Without this book I would not have passed the test. Its essential for anyone studying for this exam. And its very interesting reading.
5,One of Lewis's best,"IMO, this is one of Lewis's best works. It is not a collection of columns as many of his books were, but an autobiographical account of his career as a journalist, spanning from his days at the University of Georgia and working for the Athens newspaper to his brief career in Chicago to his eventual, grateful return to Atlanta.Inspiring, thoughtful, and downright funny at the same time (the scene with one of Lewis's editors planning coverage of the Second Coming is a riot), If I Ever Get Back to Georgia would make a great gift for any college student aspiring to break into newspapers. What better way to be inspired than to read one of the great Southern humorists!"
2,Disappointed,"Having read other books by Lewis Grizzard, I decided to buy this audiotape. I was very disappointed. It did not seem funny to me and in fact, I was bored. Perhaps some things are funnier when you read them instead of hearing them read aloud."
4,Excellent read for Steinway enthusiasts,"This is a wonderfully illustrated book presenting the whole history of the Steinway company from it's start in New York untill today. The text in historically insteresting, and the book uncludes a large number of excellent illustrations. There are pictures of many Steinway models, various historical photos of the NY stores and factory, art case pianos galore, old advertisements, and more. The history of the piano is tied closely to this company. And don't forget, it was first and foremost the piano that introduced music to the general public (before the age of the gramaphone and the CD)."
4,Good idea - needs to be more sturdy,"The product is well designed, takes up the right kind of space, good price, and so forth. Just 2 issues...1) The compartment for toothpaste needs to be larger, even if all it expects to hold are conventional soft tubes. The stiffer more metallic tubes don't compress enough to fit.2) The moldings that hold the outermost opaque cover to the base are fragile and easily broken (guess how I know that)."
2,"Nice idea, but fragile","The concept is nice, but the quality is not there. Mine actually arrived with one holder broken (even though the box was intact), and, as Karen's review says, the clips on the bottom break easily - don't try to take it apart to clean, just soak it intact.Also, the niches for brushes are different sizes, and only the largest will hold a modern toothbrush with a sculpted handle."
3,"Great, but fragile!","I really like the overall concept, however it is extremely fragile. Also, the toothpaste holder is rather small and so when you try to force it in the existing compartment, it makes the already fragile dental center just about fall apart.Like I said, I love the overall concept. At the end of the day it is great for keeping tooth brushes protected and away from any spraying or contamination. It is simply not sturdy enough for all it was meant to do, but good enough for important use."
1,Disappointing service,"I was disappointed in the level of service exhibited by this seller. Although two books were ordered, only one was shipped to me. The company was absolutely no help in tracking down the book that I am still missing, even though they have kept my full payment. It is next to impossible to get in touch with them, and I am disgusted with their lack of concern for this customer."
4,Good detector for the money,"I have just used this detector a couple of times. When working a park most coins found were exactly what the detector said they were and typically at 6"". The kids had a blast with it."
3,Screen Problems,Overall this is a good product for listening to youre child at night. But when we put the batterys in and unpluged the handset the screen just quit working all together it eventually came back on about a week later but for awhile there it just wasnt what we overall paid for.
5,Clarks Artisan Sandal,Love the sandals. They are great looking and fit wonderfully. It is also so nice to find shoes in a size 5.5 - getting harder all the time to find shoes under a size 6.
5,Have a boat? this book is for you,"if you need a book that gives just alittle more then basics, that gets you by with 99% of line needs, this books is for you. Splicing, tyeing, whipping, etc. the basics you need without all the extras some authors add to what seems to me to confuse you. I really like this book."
3,Knots,"I do decorative knotting and could find nothing new as far as kind of knots. However, the instructions and diagrams are very clear. I often buy knot books just to get different methods of teaching the same knot. One way might be easier than another. I would give 5 stars for their clear instructions"
5,Reasonably good quality tool,This is handy to keep all your hex keys in one convenient place. So glad I can pass all my loose ones on.
4,The only bib my daughter will wear,"I don't know if it is a defiant toddler thing or what -- but my 18-month-old daughter will only wear this bib (which is why I had to buy two more). The pocket is very functional -- great at catching food -- and I find this material doesn't get as ""smelly"" as some of the other bibs, even though you can put those in the washer. Only two minor complaints -- the bib stains from sauces and it is a little short on my daughter. However, she is tall with a long torso."
4,"Good, but still gets stained.","I was hoping to find a bib that could withstand the day to day exposure to orange foods and not end up looking dirty. This one does a better job than the clear plastic bibs, but the edge still looks a bit stained. It does a great job catching food and liquid, and it's easy for my daughter to retrieve cereal that didn't quite make it to her mouth. I may have her wear it in the car and just start with cereal in the bib, so she can snack during the drive."
2,not quite the same,"We used to have kiddopotamus bib, which was from nice, soft rubber, this one is considerably stiffer, not so good. It is less than perfect but since the original ones are nowhere to be found, there is not much options..."
3,Great idea but just shy of fabulous,This bib is meant to catch everything and roll up for easy travel. It catches a fair amount and does indeed roll up. It is also much softer and more comfortable than the Baby Bjorn bibs but we've switched back to the Baby Bjorn bibs for every day meals at home. Much less mess.
4,Love these Bibs!,"Super easy to wipe down and clean. When they would get really messy, I'd throw it on the top rack of my dishwasher! Also love the pocket that catches all the crumbs! Love these bibs!"
5,Takes me back,"Nobody can sing like the Carpenters. They have such a unique sound along with so much emotion in their music. Most of the tracks on this album will take you back if you're older like me. If you're younger, this is the stuff that dreams are made of."
5,Couldn't get home for Christmas,"Back in 1971, my college roommate had this album. The dorm had pretty much emptied for Christmas break, however my ride wasn't leaving until Christmas Eve morning. So, as I WAITED to get home, I repeatedly played the song ""Sometimes"" and cried and cried. It is very short and I remember the words to this day:""Sometimes, not often enough, we reflect upon the good things. And those thoughts often center around those we love.And I think about those people...who mean so much to me.And for so many years have made me...so very happy.And I think about the times I have forgotten to say...Thank you and just how much I love them.""[My family will never know how I cried for them while waiting AND I'm sure I fought with my siblings and folks-just like normal-when I did get home!] By the way, my sister gave me this album for Christmas!"
5,better than the 8 track,"i know it's a stupid title for a review, but one of my first memories is of my mom playing this album on 8-track when i was a boy. I loved this album, and although I had little musical knowledge at the time, I knew what I liked and how amazing Karen Carpenter's voice was. I consider myself a pretty manly man, but ""Rainy Days and Mondays"" can still almost make me cry."
2,"Ok, but expected more from this vocal group","I know that Richard was the talent with the arranging and writing and Karen's history, but the breadth of what I expected here was more originals vice rehashing other's work."
4,karen for comforting,"a fine carpenters album, not great because it contains embarassing moments, like the two richard solo features, 'saturday' & 'druscilla penny' (horrible!); yet of course, what to say of the rest, especially the three singles, 'rainy days and mondays' & 'superstar' in particular; & that hidden gem that is 'let me be the one'; one can be as depressed as hell, yet karen is BOUND to comfort you if only just a LITTLE with that song; also beautiful is the closer 'sometimes', restrained & touching"
3,"Like WarioWare: Touched!, except sucky","Sounded like an interesting concept, but the mini-games are somewhat ridiculous, and the graphics are very uninteresting. Managed to be amusing for about 15 minutes, and I would probably only ever play it again if I was REALLY bored."
4,One of the best DS games out there.,"At, first this game seems wierd....and it is. But that doesn't mean it isn't great. This game uses every part of the DS system, but the buttons. The missions range in anything from spray-painting a wall with the touch screen to blowing out a giant candle with the DS' microphone. The story mode is wierd and fun, but pretty short. However, once you complete it you are treated to new costumes for your character's girlfriend as well hard and hell modes. I have beaten this game 100% and i know that it is one of the funnest, most re-playable DS games in existence."
5,"Fun, unique game","I bought three DS games the day I purchased my DS: Spider-Man 2, Mario 64 and Feel the Magic XY/XX. Of the three games, Feel the Magic is the one that best showcases the kind of madcap fun that the DS can bring to gamers. Basically FTM is a collection of mini-games where you use your voice and the touch-screen to impress the girl of your dreams by acting out weird, Jackass-style stunts. I play this game during my lunch breaks at work, and it's very, very hard to put down!"
5,"A fun game with a basic, yet crazy, love story that showcases the features of the DS.","A game so nice I bought it twice.This is one of my favorite games for the DS, even now that it is gradually being replaced by the 3DS. It consists of a series of mini-games(mostly touchscreen related) that are tied together by the story of a guy trying to win the affections of a girl. Note: during the story panels that pop up prior to each mini-game you can touch the screen and unlock outfit pieces for the gal, and if you are playing it on a DS or DS lite and happen to have some old Sega Gameboy Advance games, put some of those in the GBA slot to unlock more outfits."
3,Ohh laa laa,"Okay! This game was questionable at first. I really don't know what to say about this game! Either you like it or you don't. I personally found it kinda annoying. The game could have a better title and cover art on the box. In my opinion, there is not too much replay value on this game, go get WarioWare Touched instead."
3,,whoa freaky game...u havent used the ds til u used it to make a man puke out fish and all to impress a girl. wow the japanese have the weirdest ways to impress girls. blowing ouut candles? the good part is that this game is quite a game of graphics it seems so real. The bad part is when someone asks u why u are rubbing a video console while the sound of a man puking is coming out. Buy the game i mean uve got to explore every part of the ds and i mean e v e r y s i n g l e p a r t.
2,Not worth it!!!,"I loved playing Feel the Magic when I got it and love the look to it. So lets see, colorfull, neat, exciting, creative and most of all...frusterating! As I played on, the game got more and more difficult into levels that surpass anything worthwhile. I mean, this game takes hours to beat a single, 5 minute game. dont waste your time like i did, just chill out and wait for the good title...'till then...owning mario 64 as ur only game is better than blowing 30 bucks on this. but i still like it...i just can't stant it! lol."
1,Dont waste your money,I heard all the hype on this game from several different game stores and other sources so i thought id buy it and try it out. Bad Choice. This has got to be the dumbest game ever released. It is highly over rated and very short. After about 10 minutes of playing it I was ready to break out an atari and play pong. Thats about how much fun it is. I wont be surprised to find it in a clearance section of wal mart very soon.
1,This game stinks,"This game is the worst. U cant eeven see the peoples face. Y dont u spend ur money on something better. Something like maybe A GOOD GAME like Super Mario 64 DS, Madden 2005, The Urbzz, Sims in the city, and/or Warioware touched. I have a review for each so be sure 2 look at it. This game is the worst i have ever played. Dont get this game it has a harible story, harible graphics, and very very harible formAt."
3,Interesting game that uses many DS features,"The graphics on this game are the best feature - they aren't realistic, but very trippy. The game play is not so strong. While it is mostly fun, it is simply a series of mini-games strung together with a story. The music is excellent but becomes repetitive. An ex. of the mini games: scream into the DS microphone for what seems like forever to get a girls attention; blow into the microphone to make a sailboat move across the water (cooler than it sounds); Rub goldfish out of a man's stomach; tap scorpions off of the girl as she makes suggestive sounds (not for public play as people will wonder what you are watching). If you like the idea of mini-games then this might be perfect for you. Don't believe it has much replay value, but there are a lot of levels and they do get very difficult."
5,One of the Best,Dick Siegel is one of the great undiscovered gems out there. Angels Aweigh is a great album by any measure and deserves a hell of a lot more noteriety that it has gotten. You should do yourself a huge favor and buy this album.
5,America in the early 20th century,A fascinating picture of North America in the first years of the 20th century seen through the eyes of a young Englishman from the establishment making a grand tour of America rather than Europe. It is in the tradition of 'travel books' of the period - his impressions of a strange land - and thus also tells us something about people of his class and country.
1,DO NOT USE THIS BOOK,"This book is, in every way confusing and poorly written. It is poorly organized, making it extraordinarily difficult to understand the fundamentals of assembly language programming. There were also dozens of careless errors, some of which made concepts almost impossible to understand. Professors: Please do not inflict this book upon your students"
3,Almost perfect,"I really liked the corner bed style. I worried about washing it. The cover does zip off, but the bolster padding doesn't come out. I am worried the sides will get all lumpy if I wash it. Also, I purchased the bed through Pet Market and it took longer to arrive than they had promised."
5,"Haunting, lyrical, and beautiful","What is it about some music that haunts and lives inside your head. This is the CD that does that for me.Haunting Me has great lyrics, an easy to follow tune, and is probably my favorite Grusin song out of hundreds.Grusin is a low profile very successful movie sound track composer who does not get the credit he deserves.Who could forget ""On Golden Pond"" and ""Tootsie"" but he goes beyond that.This CD reminds one of those special times with someone special.How do you define and quantify emotions?This CD will haunt and enchant you."
4,Megaptera - 'Curse Of The Scarecrow' (Relapse Records),"Vaguely even remember this Swedish artist - best described as 'industrial metal' or as a few might consider it as dark industrial - either way, this CD is a good pick for loyal patrons of this genre. Basically, just one member - Peter Nystrom who is noted as playing all instruments. Better tunes include the power-house ""Disturbance"", the nine-minute title track ""Curse Of The Scarecrow"" and the strange-sounding ""Hear My Bowels"". Should likely do the most good for fans of Cold Meat Industry, Mekan Organiki and New Risen Throne."
1,Season 2 Sucked,Jake & The Fatman Season 2 Not As Good As Season 1 Most Of The Episodes On One Disk Kept Were Sticking !And Some Episodes I couldn't Follow Very Confusing ! I Like Jake And The Fatman But This One However Gets One Star !
4,Okay,I bought this before I got my 4 gig Duo. I'm happy with the UMD but now I do not need to buy them anymore.
2,Not Good!!!,This game is actually pretty horrible. The graphics are not very detailed and all the game really entails is sitting in a stationary position shooting at Japanese aircraft. The game has absolutely no depth and the average person I became bored with it rather quickly.
2,Not for the serious game players,"If you are after a solid challenging game, then this is not for you. However, if you want something simple to waste time, then this game is ok.It is old style shooter where new things keep poping up and they get harder to hit as time moves on.Get the current patches! The graphics improve. However, there is still a system crash bug after the 20th level. There are also a couple bugs where there is a ""magic portal"" in the sky the planes use to reappear behind you. Annoying....Again, if you are an advanced game player you probably will not like this game."
1,DO NOT BUY! REPEAT DO NOT BUY!,"THIS GAME IS AN EMBARASSMENT TO THE US ARMED FORCES AND ANY FORMER MEMBER. ALL YOU DO IN THIS GAME IS SHOOT AT ENDLESS AMOUTS OF ZEROS AND KATES UNTIL THE COMMANDER TELLS YOU YOUR MISSION IS COMPLETE. THEN THAT IS REPEATED ABOUT 20 TIMES. ALL THE SHIPS SEEM TO SINK EXCEPT YOURS , WHICH REMAINS SPOTLESS AND UNTOUCHED. IT SAYS YOU ARE SENT TO DIFFERENT AREAS, BUT THEY ARE ALL THE SAME NETHERLESS, BUT JUST WITH EVEN MORE ZEROS THAT DONT EVEN EXPLODE WHEN BLOWN UP. THEY 'MAGICALLY' DISSAPEAR INTO THIN AIR. IM JUST A TEENAGER, BUT I EVEN KNOW THAT THIS PIECE OF JUNK ISNT WORTH THE PACKAGING OR THE TITLE OF A COMPUTER GAME ITSELF. I PITY THE PEOPLE WHO MADE THIS BECAUSE IF THIS IS WHAT GAMES ARE GONNA BE LIKE FROM THIS COMPANY, THEY ARE IN DEEP DOO-DOO..."
1,All Hype No Bite,"My 14 year old son and I loaded Pearl Harbor with much anticipation last night as we were eager to see this much talked about game. Boy - what a dissapointment!!! My son played for about 20 minutes before he said: ""Dad, I'm sorry but you wasted your money. This game is terrible."" and went to bed.It is lacking in realism and excitement. It is along the line of an arcade game in that you point and shoot at a moving target which becomes very boring in a short period of time. The hype is that you will sense the battle itself but I felt as if I was very detached from the overall action. The graphics are poor and the game itself is totally lacking. I'm a novice gamer and on my second attempt I was able to complete all levels. Hate to say it but this game is a dud."
2,"3dfx card owners, avoid this title!!!...","The Premise of this game is decent, a quick easy action title like Beachhead 2000 & B-17 Gunner also made by Wizardworks/ Infogrames. But if you have a 3dfx card in your system like most of you still do, since 3dfx has been dead only for a couple months, the graphics are ugly and extremely pixelated. Basically the game doesn't look like it does on the box. Infogrames tech support told me after E-mailing them to either return the game or invest in a Nvidia GeForce card, a 3dfx patch is not in the future for DTFPH. Now honestly, who is with any sense is going to spend $150 on a video card for a $20 game that will get old and extremely repetitive like Beachhead 2000 in a month!!!..."
1,Avoid it like the plague!,"Another tired Wizard Works piece of crap. You've heard of diploma mills before right? Well, this company is in the game mill business. They believe quantity (the more cheap games they put out the better their chances at profit) is better than quality. After playing the Deer Hunter games I should have known better, but I too was drawn in by the title. Everyone else that disliked this dog pretty much summed up the bad elements. So I'll just add that you might as well spend the ... and go see the movie 'Pearl Harbor' with your buddies/girlfriend/wife/whatever. Great flick, horrible game."
3,Want A New Addiction? Check This Out!,"This game is highly recommended for those who enjoy the thrill of battle and can still stay alive! The reason for the 3 stars is because the game has a problem with graphic representations with the Voodoo3 3D cards. On the CD, they give 2 (that I've found so far) different websites for updates and patches. Neither has information on this particular game. The readme file and the little book that comes with the game doesn't tell you all the controls you can use for the game and there is no joystick selection available, its all done with your mouse. But regardless of these factors, the game is fun and really gets you into the action quickly."
5,It's Adorable!,This pillow is really more like a doll. My little girl takes Strawberry Shrotcake to bed with her every night. The doll is almost life-size and so soft. We also have the Apple Dumplin' talking doll that correlates perfectly to the size of this big sister Strawberry Shortcake. I have to think it's so much more fun to play with your friend Strawberry Shortcake when she is closer to your size.
5,A DELICIOUS LITTLE PICK ME UP...,"Feelin' low? Feelin' blue?... Well, brother, pop this marvelously produced, whimsical piece of cotton candy fluff debut into your stereo and it'll make that frown turn upside down! The singer's voice is pure pop perfection, kind of like a silky Betty Boop, but much less annoying. Dreamy lyrics, a great tight set, and even a flute perk you up, make your feet tap to the beat, and take your cares away like so much Calgon...."
4,candy coated,"it doesn't get much sweeter and purely pop than this. legendary (?) album of non stop wonderous songs sung with doe eyed enthusiasm by Nina. her smooth voice melting like gooey gumdrops all over this sonic bubblegum. a real audio candy treat. once you hear songs like ""Rise and Shine"", ""Sick and Tired"", and ""Fine"", you'll be helpless in their clutches...don't even try to fight it."
3,Not my Favorite Wee Sing Book,"My 20 month old daughter owns several Wee Sing books, but we do not read this one often. The story simply does not flow well and the words are different from what I remember as a child. This is a minor thing except the chorus is only printed on the front page and then the book only prints what the little ant does. I find it distracting to have to remember the rest of the song's words to get to the littles one's part. The Hokey Pokey is a much better choice."
4,"The cover plate isn't ""brushed metal"", its grey plastic","I had a 30 year old in the wall timer that stopped working. This one seemed to be nearly identical (except I went from an old 12 hour timer to this new 6 hour timer). The item functions properly, but the description is wrong. The cover plate is *not* brushed metal, it is grey plastic. My old 12 hour timer had a brushed metal cover plate, so I wanted the same for the replacement. Somewhat disappointed about this. And no, I cannot use my old cover plate because I changed from a 12 hour timer to a 6 hour timer (half the price - not sure why). One star deducted for the misleading description/title."
4,Interesting -- raises more questions than it answers.,"Worthwile reading for any Zappa fan. The books help one gain insights on Frank, his music and performances. There are several photographs and much historical perspective. However the book seems to tell as much (or more) about the author as about Mr. Zappa. The author's love of, and anger towards, Zappa may allow for a distorted picture. I questioned the accuracy of some of the information."
4,A Fine Fast Read,"It was a nice readable book with information that is interesting and plausible. If you like Zappa, and you like information about Zappa, it's interesting, but the writer also has some self deprecating and humorous stories to tell about her relations with him during this mid-career point for Zappa."
1,Who Nigey Lennon??,"Who is Nigey Lennon? There are no reference anywhere else to her.If she knew Zappa ever, it is insignificant."
4,Good product,"Happy with it. It's on me, but it does take me some practice & refreshing to be good with it. Very good for the money in any case."
4,Work Well - Recommended,"These Restore Odor-Absorbent Dressing were provided by my wound-care specialist and have made a difference in dealing with my active Pyoderma Gangrenosum (don't look that up on a full stomach). These pads work much better than I expected at reducing the unpleasant odor that the deep ulcerated wounds produce between dressing changes, which can save much embarrassment when out in public as well.They are expensive and really don't serve any medical use, but they are worthwhile in dealing with a difficult condition psychologically and socially.Recommended!CFH"
4,Inspirational,"It a very astonishing book, different from any other book I have read. It was descriptive and very easy to understand. I also liked the book because of the character; he explains things that related to me and questions that concerned me. It has showed me that lives after death really do exist and it is a journey. The insights and knowledge after reading this book has enhanced my faith. This book will take you on journey. Before reading this book I was a little skeptic, but after reading it was clear I wasn't."
1,Piece of crap!,Man what a piece of bulls...This book is a brain wash from the HP Blavastsky followers. I really appreciated the chapter about loans. Ex: Every loan you make should be paid off unless you want to pay it with your karma... or the Saint Germain organisation. I wonder which one I would prefer...
2,Disappointing,"This battery didn't have that much more life than the factory one, and it died within 7 months of light use.Possibly a defective unit..."
2,We go together is great!,"We Go Together is great! The San Antonio group, The Royal Jester , the songs that made them a hit with the young chicanos of San Antonio. If you like Oldies this cd is a must. Five stars!!!!!"
2,Endings:A Book With No Point,"As you can tell from my title, this was not one my favorite books. Bradley started out explaining how we, as a society, separate between the living and non-living. This led to many topics on the subject of death, which was not appealing to me. He did, however, do a good job of explaining his thoughts, but it just wasn't an interesting topic I suppose. The author seemed to repeat many things throughout the book and didn't have a clear point, just to write about death. Overall I do not recommend this book, not only because of the content, but it is a little depressing reading about death."
1,Can't believe the previous reviews,"I'll begin by saying that my cats have a voracious appetite. They are under a year old. 10 months? They can eat an enormous variety of food. For this reason I was flabbergasted that they (both) smelled the food and walked away! Then I tried mixing it with a dry cereal that they love, NOPE, that didn't work either. So i allowed a good 20 hours go by without feeding them and again nothing. They would have starved before eating this stuff. The packaging is also what got me. They threw in a couple of cans they were dinged up and no labels. You couldn't place those on a store shelf, but hide them in the box for an unsuspecting online customer? Sorry can't rate this even one star. The worst part is I have another shipment this time ""chicken and liver"" from the same company. I'm praying."
4,One Of the Best Soundtracks Ever,"Bedtime Story, the soundtrack to the German film ""Der Joker"" makes all other possible soundtracks seem like a joke to us Tony Carey fans. Hitting hard with Burning Bridges, this cd is very good offering up good rocking tunes, mixed with the great ballad writing of Mr. Carey. Favorites on this cd include, Burning Bridges, Bedtime Story, Somewhere Down the Road and The Joker. An import from Germany, it has been digitally remastered, and brings out every note of music and Tony Carey's voice and songs telling us great stories as we know him to do. Very good cd and I fully recommend its purchase."
4,a little harder rockin than my other tony carey cd's,"this album is a little bit harder rockin than my other tony carey cd's. It's not quite as good as I won't be home tonigth or the boystown still it's pretty good. bedtime story, my my my, keeping the tigers away, burning bridges are the best songs on it.I don't mind hard rock by the way...I have a lot of metal cd's...tony carey does seem to do ballads and softer songs better. friends, keeping the tigers away, the joker are softer than rest of cd"
2,Not what it seems.,"This does not look the same as in the picture provided. Instead of a disco ball, it looks like plastic with silver glitter in it. I was disapointed, seeing as how I was buying it for my niece."
4,softer than expected,Very tasty but the texture was a bit softer than other brands I've tried. I would buy these again though because the flavor was good and the price reasonable.
4,Sardines are Better When Packed in Oil,"I've been looking for these to appear on Amazon for a while because I like sardines in oil better than those in water. The oil helps them slide down better and the oil gives a bit more flavor. I'm saddened to see they've used soy bean oil, I'd rather have them in sardine oil or olive oil; soybean oil is OK for printing inks and such but shouldn't be fed in any form to the unsuspecting public. Oh, well, beggars can't be choosers."
4,A good product,My most recent sardine order was for 3 types of sardine.This type came in 2nd place.Decent flavor and texture. Better than the more expensive Crown Prince Two Layer Wood Smoked Brisling Sardines in Olive Oil.Sardines include skin and bones (This was what I wanted.)
3,Good High Yield Garden Starter,"If you're looking to take your vegetable to the next level, Small-Plot, High-Yield Gardening is a good read and a good place to start. What I found most useful in this book are the listings of dates to plant specific crops (based on the average last frost date); if you're designing a vegetable garden with succession planting in mind, these dates can help you plan the crop ordering. I'll be putting these concepts to use in a 320 square foot vegetable garden in 2011 (a photo journal article will be posted on my web site.)"
5,It's just what I was looking for,This book is just what I was looking for. It was written for people just like me-wanna be gardeners. Gardening is just my hobby but I want to get results for all my work. I enjoy working outdoors. I find it so relaxing. Knowing how to do it right gives me more confidence. Just love the book. Can't wait for Spring so I can start planting.Josephine
5,WOW,"What a wonderfull soundtrack!! this movie is really moving and emotionally, each track of this cd is great, the composition is so lovely and intense that i can't stop listening this cd. It is specially for relax and for thinking what beautiful is the life that always is a hope on the way."
5,Peaceful music,"I have seen Finding Neverland 3 times (due to Johnny Depp!) and every time I fell in love with the music. The music is sensitive, moving, fun and captures every emotion that the characters go through in the movie (death, happiness, adventure etc). The music is very peaceful to listen to when reading or relaxing in a bath."
5,The future...,"The thought that the future of classical music lies in musical scores for film is epitomized in this amazing soundtrack. It is peaceful, moving and so appropriate to the film's message and style."
3,Pretty good,"The book has some good information and at times is a delight to read. I found the Japanese chapter uninteresting, but the chapters on the Gilded Age and the 1920s more than make up for it. The book does make a convincing case that the 1990's mirror the speculative bubble of 1929. We shall see if the decade ends in the same way as the great crash."
4,Slow Start But Worth The Read,"The downside to this book is also its greatest strength. Chancellor details the long history of speculation in the financial markets. So while the first part of the book may not seem to relate well to current financial markets, it lays the groundwork required for the historical perspective. In this light I found the book both fascinating and terrifying. Some of Chancellors arguments about market efficiency and fragility seem overblown, but all are well thought out and supported. Anyone who is interested in investing, or the financial markets should read this book."
3,"Important, But Poorly Written Book","The concepts are important. However, the author needed a good editor to help edit. He periodically became lost in his own moralizing."
2,Dry and not the whole story,"This book is not that good. First is it a fairly dry history. The stories of the manias and bubbles that make up the book are fascinating times with fascinating people but the tales told here are dry and better told elsewhere.The subtext in the book, that we are in a mania and bubble today, is important and reasonable. A more important, relevant and interesting subject are the stories of other transitional times in history, like the introduction of the railroad, the car, the telephone, the printed page or the industrial revolution. Comparing those times to the introduction of the Internet would be more valuable or at the least should not omitted completely from the text."
5,Interesting lessons worth taking to heart,"I read this book a while back. This is a history of speculative bubbles. It is stunning that since the beginning of the establishment of the financial market abuses and excess crop up with stunning regularity. In the long sweep of financial history Chancellor has found the regular pattern that market participants are under the delusion that ""this time its different"". This conclusion does ring true in our time as we are just coming out of the derivatives debacle of 2008-2009. With every technological achievement both financial and embodied we come to these sorts of traps.Will financial markets fail and fail every so often? President Barrack Obama said that the financial reforms he and his congress put in place will end all financial crisis. It is doubtful, and not because of his failings. If we are to learn from the conclusions reached by Chancellor, then this book deserves to be read by you and a five star rating."
3,"Broad Historical Sweep, But Quite Tendentious","Chancellor provides a detailed and entertaining historical sweep of financial market speculation from the Dutch tulip bubble of the 1630s through the collapse of LTCM in 1998. Throughout, however, he often makes the effective analogue of what recent Nobel Prize winner Chris Sims famously labeled `incredible identifying restrictions.' In the final pages, he comes out in favor of fixed exchange rates. In the final footnote, he favorably cites a Labor MP wrote that the single European currency `is the only way Britain can protect itself from the ravages of currency speculation ...' Sitting in late 2011, amid increasing (reasonable?) speculation that the Eurozone's system of fixed exchange rates may unravel sooner rather later, Chancellor doesn't look terribly prescient."
3,A bit of a slog,"Maybe I've read too much on this topic, but seems like nothing to new or earth-shaking here."
4,Timely & Insightful,"I enjoyed this book very much. Chancellor was able to shine some new light on many well discussed topics. The book is well written & researched, the footnotes alone would make for an interesting read. Full of trivia, factoids & other amusing mishaps. For those interested in general finacial history, speculation included, look at Charles Geisst's book, ""Wall Street: A History"".Timely, insightful & entertaining."
2,Not impressed,I would have to say that the only thing this product does is make you a little hyper or even edgy. It doesnt really do much for the libido. If anything it makes you more sensitive. I would try something else... Like slower your breathing... it helps more than this product.
5,Christmas Magic!,"Although this book is intended for the 12-year-old set, it also appeals to older (though not TOO much older) readers.The story of twin girls whisked away to a fantasy land and forced to help twin pinces fight off an evil Wizard is, admittedly, farfetched from a series that's never delved into fantasy before, but still very captivating."
5,20 out of 10,"Praise goes to Francine Pascal and Jamie Suzanne for a truly excellently written and extremely imaginative story,one to rival Enid Blyton.The Sweet Valley twins,Jess and Elizabeth,are spiralled into some wild and wonderful and often frightening adventures in an enchanted land after they follow their dolls which have come to life into a vortex."
5,DEFINITELY THE BEST BOOK IVE EVER READ,It is a wonderful story that teaches Jessica and Elizabeth the true meaning of friendship. It was wonderful. I rate it a definite ten!!! All of you reading this get this book! I promise you will absolutely love it!!!
4,Truly inspirational,"I probably first read this book 6 or 7 years ago, but I make a point of reading it every year since then around Christmas time. I'm 19 now, and I still find this book extremely entertaining. When I was 12, this book inspired me to write a fantasy book. I'm still working on revising it to this day. I would recommend The Magic Christmas not only to Sweet Valley fans, but also to any fan of magic or fantasy."
3,poor packaging for shipping,I am pleased with the gift set. The item was only wrapped in brown paper. One of the corners of the box was badly damaged due to I guess a corned got smashed in shipping. Regardless the cardboard box that the books reside in was damaged. I thought it was a shame that a collectors set like this was not packed to withstand any type of drop from the carrier.
5,Great Buy,I love these books. They are awesome from start to finish and worth giving a read if you like reading action type christian series of books.
2,disappointed,"the only reason this was a ""set"" is the books belonged to the same series, different sizes, poor description, over ratednot even close to the first half of the series from a different source"
2,Amazon can't deliver,"These are great books. I ordered the box set 1 for my mother for Christmas. She loves them. I ordered box set two on Jan. 2 for her Birthday on Jan. 9. I first got a delay in shipping until Jan 20. I got another delay on shipping until Feb. 23! The books are great but Amazon can't deliver. I have a strong feeling come Feb. 23, the date will be put back again."
3,A good album but has a guest singer.,"This is an album for Carpenters collectors only.I was disappointed to find that it has a guest singer(Pete Henderson)on a long medley and,although he sings OK,it's just not Richard or Karen.Most of the songs feature Karen on lead,including a very nice version of ""Sing"" where Karen sings in Japanese with the Kyoto childrens choir.Overall,it's a reasonable live album,but I would recommend the Carpenters ""Live At The Palladium"" CD over this as the Carpenters perform with an orchestra on that and don't on this album.The backing group is good but cannot compare with an orchestra."
2,"decent performance, limited track selection","I love Karen's voice, but I find this collection very disappointing, particularly for the price. Both discs would have easily fit onto one cd. ...The performance is okay but nothing to rave about. Buy 5 or so of their individual albums and enjoy yourself more."
1,The Greatest Air Show on Earth,What a disappointment!! I think a rank amateur filmed this. I have seen home movies shot better than this. We saw more of the people of the beach than planes. Most planes were filmed from a distance or from the large screen set up for viewing on the beach. Not worth the money in my opinion.
2,Smelled bad.,"Smelled terrible. It just smelled really bad. Stop carrying it. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad product. Please? Alright, awesome. Yes."
2,"They may not be so ugly as the Ramones, but ...","... they sound nowhere near as pretty. I bought this album for its one stand out track ""Gotta go"", but really, the only redeemable aspect of this song is the rocking chorus. Other than that, every song on this mediocre release sounds the same. Younger children may eat this up like candy, but how will they ever be exposed to the Young Hasselhoffs? No one who has been introduced to the ground breaking works of Jason's major influences would choose to make this band popular. My undereducated advice to the Young Hasselhoffs would be this ... learn your instruments boys, learn the fine art of song writing, and try again next millenium."
2,Poor Sound Quality,"We purchased this unit to replace our old (about 10 years) VHS camera - also a Panasonic - which operated well for many years. We wanted something inexpensive, and simple to use; without all the ""bells and whistles"", and with the convenience of simple popping the tape (via the adapter) into our VCR player. Operation is relatively simple, and the picture quality is okay (not great, but what you would expect for a camera at this cost). However, the built-in microphone produces much worst than would be expected quality during playback - worst than our 10 year old camera. In fact, it is so poor, that we probably will not keep this camera."
3,Good Flag,"It is what it is. Doesn't cost much and isn't too flashy. Just how I wanted it, and it's just how I got it. Really nice!!"
4,Good samba bossa,Another fine Brazilian recording from one of my favorite Latin guitarists.Beware this is exactly the same material as on Natalia ! .
1,One struggles to choose their most compelling fault,"Indeed, the only way this CD could be more irritating is if you had to watch the band play it live!"
5,Perfect Music,"Violince....Violince...Violince....This is an amazing debut album by a band that really doesn't sound like any other I have heard in the past few years. They are all extremely talented. You have to buy this CD to understand what I am talking about. I think Martika sounds better than ever these days! I love her voice.. she is just so talented...Michael Mozart..What can I say about him? ...He's the best, a brilliant musician, and his mastery is evident on every track of this debut disc. This is an exciting album, full of surprises, you can never predict where the music is going. And that's what makes this duo so exciting. I highly recommend it"
2,Roxette warmed over,"There's no way around it: while I'm all for this shamelessly poppy sound and these splendid production values, Michael Mozart is Per Gessle without the melodic sense, and Martika is Marie Fredriksson without the range. If you like this one, I strongly encourage you to pick up Roxette's ""Have a Nice Day."""
5,Extraordinarily uplifting!! Sings straight from the heart!!,"His music comes from his heart ,his soul, and is full of emotion. The only singer that I feel, can display and express, the true feeling of these songs, his love for his homeland. His voice and songs are truly sincere."
4,Hey Everyone It's Me,"On the heels of Some Tough City and Pink World this album will stand its ground as being a very very good TC album/cd (dont we all say album?) As far as I am concerned this is a must for any TC fan, like I said right on the heels of the pyschotropic/wacked out/wonderful/awesome/mindblowing/wall crawling Pink World, Blue Highway is Tony back to his rock we were first introduced to. Its only a short disc, but an excellant one, get it if you can and it shouldnt be a problem, I get emails every day practically from Amazon telling me of Blue Highway available to purchase. So make sure you just give em your email and anything that pops up by Tony you will be informed right away. But buy this disc. I've got the cd, and two copies of the album, one is still even sealed, and a copy of the tape, all stored of course besides the cd. Thats my story and I'm sticking to it."
2,Worst John Reuben Album yet,"John Reuben, why did you leave Jesus's name out of your album? You didn't even mention HIM in your credits. Are you still a Christian rapper? Come to think about it you didn't metion HIM in the ""Boy VS the Cynic"" album either. Will Smith raps about Jesus. Your album ""The Professional Rapper"" was awesome and is one of the best Christian Hip Hop albums ever released. I have all your albums, you're a great rapper with loads of talent.Word of Mouth gets 1 star for no cussing, and 1 more star for the song ""Sing it like you mean it"" which rocked! Too bad there weren't any other good songs on the album. The rest of the album is just a group of filler emo songs that are so depressing they would make Robert Smith of The Cure cry. The beats however are sweet, as to be expected when Toby Mac is involved.John, you need to make another ""Professional Rapper"", get rid of the sad emo lyrics, and give Jesus his due praise. Your fans are waiting."
1,Beware of Bait and Switch,"I've noticed that Jos A Bank Sweaters are always paired in such a way that there's ambiguity in what exact pattern of sweater one is ordering. You like one pattern but when you order you get the other one on the ad that apparently doesn't move as well business-wise. I got burned once, last year. They count on folks not sending the items back. They are deceptive advertisers, at least for sweaters! Potential buyers beware! This particular ad is a classic example."
5,Beautifully realistic,"I simply adore this book. I was a Peace Corps volunteer in Togo (next door to Benin) and my daughter enjoys hearing my stories about Africa. We both love this book. The illustrations are a beautiful, astoundingly realistic depiction of life ""au village"". The story is sweet and entirely plausible. The title almost turned me off from the book but I'm sure glad it didn't."
1,Needs MAJOR improvement,"My first order came damaged/had cut on the fabric; the return was somewhat easy. When the replacement came- it appears that the concept is good but with some MAJOR flaws. The material used is of very poor quality; as I opened there is no support on the base none whatsover. On the base there is like an 'elbow lock' which requires a push to open/close- the edges are very rough and sharp- they are not coated so as I pushed I cut two of my fingers! Then there is a 'bar' that need to attached on the top portion to prevent from folding, that is of major flaw also...as I attached one end of the bar to the other, both side collapsed! and I almost stab myself with the bar.Overall this flaws needs to be corrected before someone gets terribly hurt. I have since returned the Paha Que Petshelter. And by the way, the company's customer service have the nerve to tell me that they will take 20% restocking fee! I'm truly disappointed."
2,"Pretty flimsy, but you get what you pay for","I bought this to play checkers with my grandson. I debated between this one and one that was a little more expensive. I wish I'd opted for the other. The board is flimsy and the checkers are thin and hard to stack to make ""kings"". I would recommend spending a few dollars more and getting something more substantial."
2,Cheap checker set,"I had read some of the reviews that this was a cheaply made checker set, but I figured for the price, I'd give it a try. Well, it is very cheap. The board is super flimsy and the pieces don't nicely stack. You can play checkers on it so it does it's job, but we'll soon be buying a nicer set."
4,Arrived Timely,My daughter bought this for a young girl in the Big Sister program. I had it sent to my daughter's college and it arrived within a week so she could give it to her little sister on her next visit.
3,Ok for the price,"I got this to teach my 5 year old son to play checker. He loves it and we have had a great time playing together. All that aside the board in very thin (about the same thickness as a cereal box) and the description says you get 24 checkers (12 red and 12 black) I only got 22 (11 red and 11 black). But I had read the other reviews before buying this and so my expectations were not that high. All in all it's fine for what I wanted, just a starter game to teach my son."
1,Flimsy,"I bought this game for the board, not the checkers. For the price of [...] (with shipping), I figured it would be a quality product. This isn't worth [...]. It needs sturdy chess pieces to lie flat and I duct taped the fold to prevent tearing. My first crappy rip-off using the internet."
3,As a preliminary only..,"This book is a good preliminary study into the subject matter if you haven't read Kricks or Sears accounts of the same campaign. If you have, then don't bother picking this book up. You'll be disappointed."
1,The description is MISLEADING! Does not include the SET,"I was very, very disappointed that I only received ONE of the four books. I was contaced by the seller to see if I was satisfied. I said no because I only received one book. The seller was apologetic and refunded a portion of the payment.The description is misleading. The seller sent me the one book we already had. I wanted the entire set for my son; and instead I got the same book we already had.Very disappointing."
4,Pretty good collesction,"This is a pretty good coolection of material from the 80's. The best selections on the cd are Fine, Fine Day, Lonelt Life. I don't like the bedtime story remix as well as the version that's on bedtime story, I wished they would of put keeping the tigers away on it instead of friends(which is a pretty good song. I believe tear down the walls or out of town woman would have been a better selction instead of she moves like a dancer from blue highway cd."
2,Hey Everyone It's Me,"This is a very simple review, if you want the full collection definately buy it, but it only has like 3 new songs, the rest are all on Blue Highway. I have both but only to the fact that I am one of the true fans and must have it all. But this cd is just a chop from Blue Highway. Once again I have to recommend A Fine Fine Day as best greatest hits, the Story So Far cd hits the bottom. Sorry. Thats my story and I'm sticking to it!!"
1,B-17 flying Fortress is better,This game reeks of stuff that is boring. I really dont like the grphics and the game it self gets extremly boring. If you want a real game get b-17 flying fortress it has the same stuff but twice as much and you can pilot the plane and take 10 different crew positions for the same price!
1,Thbbbpt! Bad Game,This Game I thought was pretty bad. The controlling of the guns is stupid and the graphics are pretty bad too. I would not recommend this to anybody.
1,There is no variety,This is a bad game. There is NO variety; you go up against the same fighters every time after the 10th mission. All the targets look almost the same from 4 miles high and when the bombs go off all you see is the same target with a little smoke on it.
1,"after awhile, you get bored","On the first day of first hours while playing this game, I got bored. Yes, this game is fun, but after awhile, this is no longer fun. I mean graphics are so aweful that when you shoot down a fighter, they fall as though there're a paper or something. I think the sound was ok. But still.....not fun....."
5,Awesome,Whats the best way to write about something so little of us really know anything about? But to actually enter the system itself and expeirence what a correctional officer goes through day in and day out. This is a must have for anyone who is interested in becomming a correctional officer or anyone who is interested in the prison system.
3,Depressing,"I guess by reviewing this book I am somewhat disingenuous because I simply could not make it through this book in its entirety. I selected this book because it was given a ""thumbs up"" by several book reviewing entities. The first half of the book - the training of the CO - is interesting as well as the reporting in and first days on the job at Sing Sing. The book bogs down frankly when the author sees fits to give the reader strong doses of the lives of long dead wardens and Sing Sing architectural history. After awhile, having felt I was incarcerated myself - I escaped and put it down. It got depressing and boring. Also, the chapters are too long."
3,Chaos at Sing Sing,"Conover's account of the NY state prison system was more shocking than absorbing to me. To see how unstructured and undisciplined life at Sing Sing is not only perturbing, but makes me think of a striking parallel to the lack of discipline in our education system. While the subject matter is great, I found Conover's style of writing a bit on the dry side."
3,"A little more journalism, a little less commentary, please.","There's a lot to admire in this book: It gives us what feels like an authentic look at a world most of us will never know (thank God!), it is often riveting, some of the vignettes are fascinating, and there's no denying Conover's guts. But it left me a little cold. Maybe it's the nature of the beast, but Conover's writing is all over the map. It might have been more interesting if he followed a narrative, or at least focused on a few COs and inmates instead of a scattershot approach. It seemed that Conover spent a year on the inside-and came away with very few insider stories & anecdotes. And a long section on the history of Sing Sing and incarceration in the US is just plain boring. I could do without his moralizing too. A little more journalism, a little less commentary, please."
4,Wow!,"I can't believe these guys (corrections officers) put up with the stuff they do. It takes nerves of steel to work in a place like that. The book was very entertaining. At times I could not put it down. Also recommended : Nine-o Adam, Another Day in Paradise, Junky, Slaughter House Five."
3,Glad it's not me,"Conover lives the life the rest of us just dream about. Trying this and that, adventuring around. This book is pretty good, could have been a bit more intense. I think my favorite lines were when a supervisor told him to "" get those guys back in their cells "" and Conover replies "" how? "" I can just see that happening to me. Glad it's not my job."
3,Only tells life as a rookie,"This is in fact one of the better books I have read concerning NY prisons. However, it is not as accurate as most would believe. The first half of the book is very good. Details about the academy and OJT(on-the-job training), are fairly accurate and for the most part portray what most of us go through. The second half however is inaccurate. We here in Northern NY do not beat convicts daily as is portrayed. Nor does any good officer give cigarettes to inmates as he readily admits to doing. We do not get chummy with convicts and talk of personal problems. We do not feel sorry for them in the least. They are here because they choose to be here. Conover needs to tell the whole story, not just his side as a liberal rookie. It is good that he quit when he did, because as a NYS Correction Officer, he is what we fear more than anything else."
4,Good book overall,"I'm about half way through the book now. I have to say that I enjoy the insider look into the prison.. although so far I can't say anything has been particularly surprising. As such, I don't feel I have really learned all that much yet. Nevertheless, Conover's writing style is informal and inviting, making this an easy and interesting read."
3,Sing Sing Correctional Officer speaks out on book,"Ted,you betrayed us. How can you,whatever your 'artistic license"" excuse can be,laugh with us,gripe with us,share intimacies with us only to stab us in the back that way you did with this book. After all you alledge you've gone through to still refer to us as 'guards' and still question our right to carry firearms for protection. Do you really think for one sec that we really thought of you as being a 'good' officer,rather you were often referred to as 'dead weight'. You could never know the inside mechanisms of a true officer's soul,for you were never one to begin with,Ted. In your heart of hearts you know that. Maybe the civilians will eat it up but the ones on the inside know you for what you are...most importantly,you know you for what you are...'nuff said."
1,Conover learned nothing in 1 year....,"Conover seems to learn nothing in 1 year on the job. You can't be running scared and still be an effective Correctional Officer. No doubt that he didn't have proper control of the situations or the inmates. Conover seems to focus on the plight of the poor inmates, victims of society. He feels sorry for the inmates. Inmates are in prison because of their choices and behavior. Prison is not the first stop for most inmates. This book gets rather tiring for people who work in the corrections field and know what it is really like."
5,Highly Recommended,This book was a very entertaining and enlightening read. Conover really gives the reader a sense of genuine prison life which is not always apparent from TV and the movies. Conover also really appreciates the moral complexity of how we treat criminals and the many paradoxes inherent in the relationships between prisoners and their jailers. The book abounds with intriguing anecdotes as well as Conover's keen insights into criminal justice. I would recommend it for just about anybody.
5,nice,got this for class and it is a really crazy interesting book. my boyfriend is now reading it and cant put it down
5,Great!,"My professor suggested this for the criminal justice class, and its a great book! I love it! Its a must read if you love law!"
5,This undercover account delivers what it promises,"This book will satisfy some of the curiosity that people have about what goes on inside prisons. Bear in mind that you'll only get an officer's perspective (of course, that's the only one he can give), and no so much of the inmates' sides. For this reason, many of the anecdotes seem incomplete... but you might find them to be complete enough. Almost all of it kept me interested. It is a good read."
5,A Must Read!,"I want to start by saying I have immense respect for Ted Conover. When our prison system denied his request to shadow a corrections officer recruit, he sidestepped the system and applied for the position himself. His commitment to the job, in order to bring us the story, is commendable.Newjack is an honest, straightforward look at life inside a prison from the viewpoint of a corrections officer. While I read a lot on this topic, most books come from the inmate's perspective. I was shocked to learn how little training these men receive. They go from a short 7 weeks at school straight to prison work, having had absolutely no prior contact or training directly with inmates. These men and women who risk their lives each day are woefully unprepared for the reality inside those walls. This book is a scary, sad, sometimes funny look at that reality.I've long believed our prison system is a mess and only reinforces negative behavior. If you doubt that at all, you need to read this book."
4,Much Respect,"I have to give the author credit. When he was denied the right to shadow a C.O. (Corrections Officer), he became one. This is not as simple as it sounds. He literally swore an oath to protect the inmates and the lives of his fellow officers. He worked the job with dedication, and got some great material out of it. I was wary, because I thought he might have been playing C.O. But, working in Sing Sing, you don't ""play"" anything. Bravo."
5,superb,"This book is daring, unusual, and--though I have never worked in a prison--seems to me exceptionally fair. Few writers have the chops to go this far in service to a subject. And it's a wonderful, fast read, unlike anything I've seen."
2,Way to much useless information,The book could have been well written in about two hundred pages...many times the details he writes about are useless to the story ..just trying to fill pages mostly..many of the books early chapters are very boring and hard to get threw..
5,Great book.,"Great book. With the author's combined backgrounds in journalism and anthropology, it's hard to see how he could have gone wrong. Add to that a good eye for picking an interesting subject, and you've got a winner."
5,Just Read It!,This is a fascinating story that gives a behind-the-walls look at what actually goes on in a prison. I sent this book to an incarcerated friend but it was intercepted by the warden. Geez... I didn't realize it was THAT controversial.
2,Makes you want to expire the bosses,"This is an excellent book to help you understand what not to do as a boss! However, if you are an employee who is dealing with a bad boss, there is no practical advise on to either 1) help you cope better, and 2) somehow get this information filtered up through the hierarchy. If you are an employee trying to get a better understanding of how to cope with the egocentric, bent on the hierarchy type boss, this book unfortunately will not help you."
3,"Easy tricks, easy to learn, good book.",I liked this little book. I like to play around with cards a bit and picked this up looking for some easy tricks that even a dolt like me could do. The book fills the bill admirably. I can't comment on what a more professional magician would think - maybe these are useful for eighth graders only - I don't know. The tricks are well explained and should be easy to figure out for anyone with more than a passing interest. Good book.
3,Card Magic,"This book is a great one for some sleights and the illustrations aren't very descriptive, but just enough so that you can understand the basic concept. The order of the tricks was put together well. If you want a book that will start you on the intermediate scale for magic with cards, get this book."
3,A Little Too Brief,"This book is definately something you should probably take a look at if you are intending to learn tensors, HOWEVER, perhaps a book such as Schaum's would be more fruitful. I was quite excited until I saw just how brief the book was. Basic concepts are dealt with very nicely, but the depth is lacking and pages 49 - 67 threw me a curve. In that particular section, clarity would have beaten brevity."
4,Brilliant...moving,"My admiration goes to Essra Mohawk for doing something different each time she makes a record (which isn't often enough). Although I think Primordial Lovers and its follow-up will remain my favourite albums, this one is very good too.While her earliest material was experimental, rambling and almost free-form, on Raindance, she has composed shorter pop/rock songs, and very well, too. ""Somebody Just Like You"", ""Long Bad Dream"", and ""Wrap it all Around"" are some of her best songs ever. Her voice is very expressive, and Raindance is a very emotional performance from beginning to end. I would particularly have loved to hear some of these songs arranged with just Essra and her piano-playing, but the arrangements on this CD are good all the same."
5,Balanced document that dispells many myths about Falun Gong,"While critical of the Chinese government, this article also documented much of Falun Gong's PR/propaganda efforts in US.Would like to highlight page 7, where Lum noted Falun Gong's ""Auschwitz"" organ harvesting allegation was investigated by US State Department in China and found Falun Gong's accusation not credible.This article maybe out of print, but is available on US State Department's website:[...]"
5,A must for every household,"This book belongs in every home. I have never read a better book on how to handle the feelings and emotions that rage over us and control us. I used it in my own life to acquaint myself with myself; to learn how the mind, body, and soul work together. It provides such a wonderful insight into what God expects of us and how he uses us; how he loves us and chastises us. Christians and non-Christians, alike, suffer depression from a multitude of sources, and this book offers encouragement and solutions in excellent, excellent, writing."
5,You don't have to be depressed to read this book,"I have been helped spiritually from this book when I was both depressed and happy. It is full of insights both emotional and spiritual. Jones draws from his medical background and pastoral training to give insights, practical and logical help for everyone. I highly recommend this for counselors, pastors and anyone who wants to grow as a Christian."
3,Three stars,Lloyd-Jones writing style is a bit repetitive and he beats around the bush too much for my taste. I have put it aside for the time being.
2,I would not recommend this book,"This book was somewhat of an annoyance to read because there is almost nothing on the CD it came with and there are not enough illustrations. For example, it talks about a bulla, pustule, etc. and it's diameter and whether or not it is pus-filled but there are NO PICTURES!!! Also, the summary should be more of a chart than just more words. I did not like how there are multiple columns to a page, either, since when you're tired and hungry it can be confusing. And then there are open-ended questions at the end of each chapter but they do not provide you the answers!"
1,DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT,"Buyers of Panasonic products beware! I purchased a Panasonic PV-DV401 in February of 2001 and the Tape Ejector Switch immediately broke while I was on vacation. I was not able to eject the tape in the camcorder.On March 10, 2001 I sent the camcorder in to the Panasonic repair facility in Elgin, IL, the only repair facility for Panasonic camcorders in the US. Almost 2 months later, I have still not gotten my camcorder back. I've called the repair facility numerous times (you have to leave a message on a recorder) to check on the status and my calls were not returned. I've also called Panasonic directly and routinely get the ""it's not our problem attitude."" Every time I ask to speak to a manager they disconnect me. I've now had to enlist the help of the Better Business Bureau, Consumer Protection Agency, and KRON TV Consumer Reports just to get my camcorder back!This product is defective and Panasonic's repair service is notorious."
4,The Price is Right,"I did a lot of research on digital camcorders on sites like cnet.com and consumerreports.org. I was leaning toward the Sony MiniDv's, but decided that the functional and quality differences was minimal, but the price difference was extensive. I having a digital camera, so still picture quality was not important. No camcorder gives high quality photos anyway. The DV401 had the larger LCD, color viewfinder, minidv size, and the magicVu that I was looking for. I recommend this as the right product for the right price!So far I haven't missed a shot with my two kids and the quality has been everything I need. I'm not making feature films - what level of quality is too much?"
3,Neat activities...but boy is it an old book!,"I was so excited when I saw this book! I bought it and read it and enjoyed most of the activities. However, I have to agree with a previous reviewer that the book was published in the 70's...and I'd really like to see this book updated. After all...so much time has passed...I'm sure some of the activities could be updated and changed. What worries me about this book is the nutrition section. They recommend having a protein shake every day for the baby's brain development. The shake recipe calls for a raw egg. Now, correct me if I'm wrong...but raw eggs are considered a no-no if you are pregnant. And they recommend that you have this shake EVERY DAY! I think this information is dangerous and puts the woman who follows that information at risk for foodborne illness. So, if you plan to buy this book...PLEASE take what you read with a grain of salt. Use your common sense and consult your doctor (especially about the egg thing!)"
4,Excellent Book - Where to buy the toys?,"Hi, I have made a few toys for our baby based on the recommendations, but would also like to buy the professionally made toys. Since this book is kinda old, I am not sure if the company still exists at the location, and what are the charges for the toys. Was anyone successful in buying these toys? Where are they available?"
3,Eh... can we say outdated???,"This book, though it has some solid foundational knowledge, is severely outdated in its information and study references... I mean, in one section of the book, they tell you to put the baby to sleep on his/her tummy - that's a no-no as we know now due to the increased risk of SIDS. I think as long as the reader has had the opportunity to educate him/herself with more current literature, there are some offerings of information that can be helpful. Overall, not as good as I had hoped."
4,Read while pregnent,This book stars while you're still pregnent. I felt so guilty when I started reading this book about all the stuff I missed out on doing.
2,An alert for expectant parents.,"Susan Ludington-Hoe provides many tips for stimulating your baby both before and after birth--but whereas these were better than none at all several years ago now they show wear. Instead, parents expecting are advised to review the most current evidence replacing Dr. Ludington-Hoe's. For example, see Dr. Sarah Brewer's Super Baby, which tells how as a physician she used Dr. Brent Logan's BabyPlus prenatal enrichment system discussed on www.babyplus.com (I understand that his own book, Learning before Birth, is due shortly through www.1stbooks.com, and contains the most up-to-date material). My own experience with this technology for two children, also the amazing reports from mothers I attended as a nurse, convinces me that a major breakthrough in fetal stimulation has taken place."
4,A quick concise history lesson,"A solid book with great insight into history. Informative and remarkably concise and very well written.One observation:Social observers overlook the impact of Eisenhower's interstate highway system, it changed America then, and will continue to play a major part in its future.One correction:Cane Ridge is in Kentucky not Tennessee. (pg.56)"
2,Cybercash suppport is a lie...,If you are considering this product for E-commerce and are attracted by the fact that it is supposed to support Cybercash do not buy it. The fact is the Cybercash Support is so poor it can seriousely affect your business.Also Version 4 hade Chrystal reports bundeled with the product which they pulled from 4.5. This is another tool we were expecting to get with the product which was actually removed without prior notice...We have tried to get support from Allaire but they have never responded... They have a pay per incident support service which is OK when you need support while developing but we do not believe in paying for support when it is the product that is deffective not the developers...For Intranet and other dynamic web apps it is fine.
5,Underrated SuperTalent,"This is one of the most wonderful experiences I have had from a modern jazz album in a very long time. Perhaps I'm a bit biased because I first saw Kathy in a local Detroit restaurant during a romantic evening, and upon listening to Kathy, my beau and I were astounded by her clarity, persona, and level of performance. She signed a CD for us, and I've been a fan of her ever since. _Man of My Dreams_ is a classic love song, and her voice travels the breadth of its notes effortlessly. This is clearly a piece of highly polished work, and any jazz or vocal fan should add this to his collection. That she's not a nationally reknowned vocal star is a perfect example of the sad state of popular and jazz music today."
4,Five stars for the film three stars for the DVD.,"Great film of course, but the DVD needs work. There is no widescreen option in this film (which is mostly a bad thing since this film was almost certainly made in widescreen) and the extra features are lacking. Other than that, it is a highly recommended film."
4,Lots of fun!,"Does it really matter that this isn't exactly ""historical?"" I mean c'mon people, it's entertainment, not a history book.My only gripe is that is was released in 4:3, aka ""Full Screen."" This was probably done for the kiddies, but for those of us that enjoy a good animated flick, release it in widescreen! That's the only reason it doesn't rate 5 stars.If you've got access to a region free DVD player, order the German version from Amazon.de. It's a much nicer presentation, in it's original 16:9, with the english dialogue track.Maybe Universal will release a special edition here in the states, with the theatrical version. Don't hold your breath too long, tho!"
5,"""Keep Trying, Don't Quit""","Excellent, action-packed production. Good adaptation of a true story, demonstrating the idea to ""keep trying, don't quit."" Children identified with rejection and praise. Encouraged reading the book. More educational than expected. ""Really great."" ""Exciting."" Animal lovers responded particularly well. Kids were curious to know more about the real story. Stimulated discussion afterwards about the role of huskies in everyday life. ""Dogs are more than just pets."" Best for ages 8 to 12."
5,"Way to go, Balto!","I have seen this a dozen times at least and I still love this movie.The characters are great and Kevin Bacon did a fine job as Balto. Jim Cummings did a fabulous job portraying Steele as well, making the malamute just so gosh-darn-cool for a baddie. The story, while perhaps not entirely acurate with history, is still a good one and I love to watch this on a cold winter's day with a cup of hot cocoa.Highly recommended!"
5,Inspiring,"I first watched this when it came out when my kids were young and decided to get it for myself. This is a great story with some historical significance. Teaches kids who watch the movie about courage, overcomming the odds, handling bullies and gives a little history. Great addition to the library."
3,Does not do the story justice.,Anyone familiar with the Iditarod and why it is run will be highly disappointed with this cartoon's portrayal. There is too much cartoon hoo-haa and not enough substance.
1,Balto,I am very dissapointed in this movie. We cant watch this movie because it says region error. Is there any way we can return it.
5,Even grown-ups will love it!,"This movie is wonderful, my children love it! The story is compelling, and has prompted my kids to ask a lot about history as well as teach them lessons about perserverence and loyalty. I like this movie more than most of the Disney movies we have!"
5,Couldn't be a better film!,"This is a really good movie.I've been watching it for as long as I can remember.It's about a dog (part wolf)who is an outcast in Nome,Alaska.He's friends with a Russian snow goose called Boris (the funniest character in the movie) and 2 polar bears called Muk and Luk who can't swim.He's also in love with a dog called Jenna, and there's a villian called Steele.When a disease strikes (with Jenna's owner, Rosie, among the sick) and the sled team sent to get the anti-toxin is lost, Balto must find and rescue the team and face avalanches,icicle falls and (of course) Steele.A brilliant movie."
5,Wonderful Movie,"I first saw this movie when I was a kid--probably nine or ten--and I loved it. I just bought it now, at 22, and I have to say it has aged very well. While the sequals (surprisingly) leave one feeling rather cheated, the first movie is excellent. A wonderful family movie it is made even better with wonderful animation, an excellent score (James Horner does not fail to please) and great voice acting. I love this movie and I recommend it to anyone old, young and anywhere in between."
5,Excellent Cat Food,"Our cats have been on Iams for years, but recently noticed inconsistencies with the product (varied moisture content, texture, smell) and switched to Natural Balance. The food is consistently the same, actually smells like turkey, and our cats love it. Very moist, providing better hydration as well. Highly recommended."
2,Where's the enthusiasm?,"Tony Carey has a beautiful voice and his singing is rather laid back in a very pleasant way. He has written many very good songs over the years, but this album is sadly not one of his better. The main problem is that the material is quite flat and can't be saved by Carey's great voice. To me it seems as Carey lack enthusiasm on too many songs. But it's not all bad, in fact the song ""No man's land"" is in my opinion so good it's easily worth the money. Then you got some songs that stands out a bit from the rest: ""Heard it on the radio"", ""For you"" and ""I can't talk to you"". This is an album you have to play time after time, since there's no immediate tunes (except ""No man's land) that will capture your attention.I'd say that ""For you"" is an album worth having, but it might not be the best first choice. Try to get ""Storyville"" - that's Tony Carey in his prime!"
3,A Music for a Change,"Who's Tony Carey? He was in charge of keyboard in Blackmore's Rainbow (See ""Rainbow Rising""). But this album is far from heavy metal or hard rock. Of course it contains somwaht hard rock songs like ""Heard it on the Raio"" but mostly has slow yet beautiful songs like ""For You"" and ""I Feel Good."" It's a good album filled with Carey's soulful efforts."
4,Impossible Missions Force - S.6,"The IMF's penultimate sixth TV Season brings us a fresh face and again a renewed sense of story. Gone are Leonard Nimoy and Lesley Ann Warren but in with the talented & beautiful Lynda Day George! (Sam Elliott as Doug drops in for his last appearance in episode 2). This season continues with contemporary adaptations for its time while still carrying the agenda of its kernel formula.Again my one star deduction is for the DVDs NOT being picture discs as with the first four season set releases. Continuing on with picture discs would have been nice with the addition of new member Lynda Day George as 'Lisa Casey' to the IMF this season. But still, it's great to have the whole season of 22 episodes at a nice price!Paramount has been fairly consistent with their release schedule of MI. Their mission, and we sure hope they accept it, is to release the final Seventh Season AND the 35 episodes of the 1988-89 version."
4,I complete my sixth Mission...Finally,"at last !!I finished watching the sixth season of Mission Impossible, in this season I can saw another character, because in previous seasons the cast change after the third.I remember in the third season and so the current change all the characters.I remember in the third season to present some of the characters change, for example in the third season Martin landau and Barbara Bain leaving the show in its place came Mr Spock (Leonard Nimoy) from the Star Trek Tee Vee Show for the fourth Season.In the fifth season fifth with Lesley Ann Warren and Sam Elliott. And the sixth season with Linda Day George. and always with original cast are Peter Graves, Greg Morris and Peter Lupus.I just miss having the seventh season for all seasons in which this program was to air, not forgetting to include the two season did in the 80s too."
3,"Great Series, but Getting Tired","I loved the old Mission Impossible series. It was way better than the Tom Cruise movies, with all the sense of adventure and teamwork which the movies lacked. Unfortunately, by the sixth season, the series seemed to have become a little tired. Martin Landau and Barbara Bain were long gone, and Leonard Nimoy, who provided much of the life in Seasons 4 and 5 was now out of the series as well. The international nature of previous seasons had also departed, with most Season 6 episodes covering activities of the ""syndicate"" which ""conventional law enforcement agencies"" had been unable to combat.Although this classic series is always interesting, and way better than the movies, for anyone who loves the series and doesn't have any of the DVDs, I would recommend seasons 2 through 5 (Season 1 is good, but the series became much better with the arrival of Peter Graves, playing the team leader Jim Phelps, at the beginning of Season 2) over this rather tired effort."
4,"More basic than earlier seasons, but in some ways more realistic.","Our family is a fan of all the seasons. This one is slightly less complex in interpersonal complexity, but the plot execution is generally more relistic. I always have a hard time with those episodes with faking people out with masks - hokey. There are a few here but not many. A large amount of organized crime plots, versus earlier international often third world villians.... we kind of miss those."
5,NO DOUBT THEIR BEST WORK.,"In my humble opinion,this is the bands best album to date.Its fast and brutal,but not as raw as the reek album.The production is much better this time around and the songs are really good.The vocals are much better and easier to decipher.The guitar work really displays their skills as musicians.I would recommend this cd to any carcass fan.These guys will be deeply missed.CARCASS RULES!!!"
5,The inventors of goregrind...,"Heartwork and swansong are both terrible carcass albums which they have melody and dont got that goregrind sound no more... But to rejoice in vomit and if your new to goregrind at all or just plain brutal guttural deathmetal ? Learn something & start here with the creators of gore. Carcass's ""symphonies of sickness"" mastepiece..."
3,SickSickSick,"Oh, no, this doesn't have the beautiful vomitorious collage of the original ""Symphonies"". Brutal Riffs, Raw Production, Sick Harmonized vocals. Mangled music from the soon to be finesse rockerz while they were still grind/crust ""ameteurs."""
5,the best album,"if you don't have the old symphonies that has all songs from reek of putrefacation and this one on one cd then buy this one cause this is their best album yet.the music makes doing work way easier and mechanical, this album is a big hit with surgeons and docters."
2,"Boring, and not much help to beginners","De. Bob should stick to soap. His candle making book is not for a beginner who just wants to know the basics in simple terms and get started. Although I am sure some of the information will be helpful to the more advanced, it was not what I was looking for to get started."
3,not for me,"What I thought I was buying was a pancake griddle with the bonus of having a grill. What I got was a too-small griddle with a grill. I don't know about you but when I'm making breakfast I want to get it cooked and sit down and eat it. The size of the griddle was good for 3 small pancakes without having them run over into the well. The metal itself was thin with a very thin coating of non-stick. The griddle was, on the other hand, very thick and heavy. The power was more than adequate. The metal on the sides was not easy to clean. For me, hopeless."
2,Get the size correct!!,"Before I ordered this grill I requested info on the useable grill cooking area. You emailed me the next day and informed me the cooking surface was 14x19.So I ordered it because I wanted the large area. Well somebody better get out there ruler...(including the manufacture, whose website also said 14x19 grilling area, and the printing on the box also says 14x19). The grilling area is only 14x9!!!The total width of the whole unit is only 11 1/2 so it couldn't possibly have a 14"" wide grill size! I probably will return this...!!!"
2,KRUPS CANYON GRILL REVIEW,"Its a great grill, I use it all the time, clean up is a snap. HOWEVER, EVERY 3 YEARS THE ON/OFF SWITCH BREAKS AND GETTING IT FIXED IS IMPOSSIBLE.I had it in a repair shop for 13 months (Ter Kuille, NJ) and they were unable to get the part. I finally wrote Krups corporate and got them to give me a new one. That was 3 years ago; as I write the switch on that one is now broken."
2,For advanced users only,"They do a terrible job of getting novice users started. In the first chapter they lecture about knowing objects inside and out, but really don't support any means of doing that short of reading the Appendices and memorizing them without any sense of context. Basically, you already need to have a VERY strong background in VBA / VBScripting for Windows applications. If you are not a HIGHLY proficient programmer/scripter who is merely looking to turn his/her focus onto how to apply those skills to this specific (and peculiar) environment, FIND ANOTHER BOOK."
2,Sporn Harness Review,"I have a 90# Doberman He was pulling my Medical Scooter when I was trying to walk him. The Sporn Harness did not help much the only way it helped is if I really had it tight on him. I was scared I would cut his circulation off so do not use it went back to a pinch collar with firmer corections.It may work well for dogs that are not head strong my Dobe is a teenager 18 months old.Sporn Large Training Halter for Dogs (Neck sizes 16""-24"") (Black - Large (Neck sizes 16""-24""))"
2,Not for big dogs,"I have a 125lb Great Dane and tried this. I think that it might work for smaller dogs but it's positioned where most of the dog's power is - in the front quarters. It does nothing to control his head - you can't stop them from sniffing or paying attention to things you want them to ignore. Luckily he was behaving himself on the walk and didn't pull too much, but I don't think he could care less that it was on and if we would have been in a more populated area I think it would have been bad bad news."
5,Demo is fun,"If a real version of this as much fun as demo version, ten this is a fun game; jumps, graphics, engine sound. Only sound of crashes is not so real."
4,Leadfoot's first review,"If you own dirt track racing, you will find this very simular expect for this is not oval track racing. Also, there is a lot of bumps and hills and i think that it is a lot more challenging than Dirt Track Racing. Overall, i think its a fun game, not the greatest ever but not the worst ever. If i were to buy the game again, i would pay about ... but not ... If you like racing, you'll like this. If you dont like racing, you wont like this!!"
4,Leadfoot is alright,"While Leadfoot does suffer some serious multi-player issues it is a fun game. It's not the all for nothing type of racing we've come to expect from Ratbag, you do have to use your brakes in this one! A few of the tracks are tough and a few are just cirles with a couple of jumps in them."
5,Banjo Ska? Come on....banjo ska?,"A fab CD from beginning to end. Everything seems to just melt together in the best possible way. I never thought 'banjo ska' (Track 6,""Monkeys"") would work, but the minute you hear it, WOW! If you ever get a chance to see these boys live, don't pass it up. Seeing them open for No Use For A Name totally propelled me to buy this CD. You're a fool if you don't pick this one up."
3,this cd is knarly,This cd had some awsome beats they should be know by more people. They are a punk/ska mix that is original.
5,Great book for children,My little 2 year old granddaughter loves this book...she has such compassion for the Mother Cat and her kittens and totally understands the gist of the book...WONDERFUL for kids...great pics too.
4,This Is Jump5?,"o.kay, I just finished listening to the c.d because one of my friends as it... this isn't Jump5, I dunno if it's because Libby left or not, but the only song I REALLY enjoy is In My Heart, and the remix of that song, the rest are just o.kay, nothing special like Jump5 used to have, I mean, what happened to the songs like ""Wonderful"", ""Wish That I Could Read Your Mind"", ""Why Do I Do""? I think if Jump5 is really going to be making Contemporary Christian albums they really need at least one song on each album that sticks out and says ""This Is A Christian Album"" which this one really doesn't have a song like that! I recommend the c.d to anyone, don't get me wrong, I'd just recommend listening to their other c.d's first so you don't get a wrong impression of them (and pray they'll have a better album next time if they stick around!)"
3,Where Is Jump5?,"I personally find it hard to believe that this is really Jump5. Their appearances have changed so much, although they do look better, I must say. And their songs are so much...cheesier, to be honest. The songs are airy, cheesy, feel-good pop songs instead of the big hit songs I loved so much in their first two albums. Jump5 has changed way too much for my liking. I can't find a song on this album as good as ""Spinnin' Around"", or ""All The Time In The World"". The way I see it, with all this changing, and Libby gone, Jump5's ""colorful dreams"" are fading. I personally think Brittany would be a huge hit if she went solo! I know I would buy all her albums. She needs to do something before she goes out with the rest of this used-to-be-great band.Or with any luck, Jump5 will still be around long enough to make a better album next time. Maybe something more of us fans are used to.This review was brought to you by new-music reviewer,GMM (Gold Mew Mew)"
2,"OK, But Needs Work","The songs are catchy and stick in my head, but who writes those cruddy lyrics? I mean ""Mind your head, get out of bed""-I can think up a better rhyme than that. Also, what's with the BARNYARD remix? Isn't the song bad enough without adding a fiddle?"
2,Disappointed Fan,"I don't like this album very much. The songs just don't seem that good. I wish Jump 5 would sing songs with a bit more meaning. Even though I'm 13, I still would like to hear songs with more meaning to them. And all these songs kinda sound the same, the beat, the music. I hope their next album is better. I still am a big fan, but maybe now that I'm a bit older, I expect more from them."
4,El CHE,tHE MOVIE WAS VERY SPECIAL TO ME . iT SHOWED THE UP AND THE DOWN IN HIS LIVES . i LIKED IT WHEN HE WENT TO THE LEPER COLONY TO SEE THE SICK PEOPLE AND HE DIDNT FOLLOW THE RULES AND HE SHOCK THEIR HAND WITHOUT A GLOVE .
5,Great music to drive by,Perfect CD to bring along for a long drive when you want to relax and not let the outside world (traffic etc) bother you. Perfect for the summer or anytime of year. Even if you didn't see the film you would still enjoy this. Also nice for background party music.
5,The Motorcycle Diaries soundtrack,"The songs are all riveting with the classic Argentinian acoustic guitar music and take me back to the scenes of the film. This is the music and movie that inspired me to join Peace Corps and learn about cultures other than mine. It also inspired me to learn to play the acoustic guitar and sing ""Al Otro Lado del Rio,"" one of the last tracks on the album. A must have item if you enjoyed the movie and are inspired by personal transformation."
4,Beautiful,"This night light is really beautiful when you turn it on. I like it so much that I want to turn the switch on during the day just to see the illuminated image. I have one small criticism about the design. The night light arrives in two pieces: (1) the base with switch and light bulb and (2) the lithophane image. You have to slide the delicate lithophane image into the base and then tighten two plastic screws in the back of the base; these screws are to hold the image in place. It was very difficult to tighten one of the screws with bare fingers. Other than that, this little item is perfectly wonderful."
1,Lo peor de Puerto Rico,"Me da verguenza que esta banda represente en términos de rock en español a Puerto Rico. Todo disco se trata de melodias de payasos o para niños con ADD. Ni siquiera tienen un buen sentido de humor o talento poetico. No vale ni la pena bajar alguna de sus canciones por Internet, ni con un DSL. Yo pensaba que el grupo ""La Secta"" era aburrida, pero al lado de Polbo, los hace ver como The Doors."
3,"Nice book, lacking umph","I bought this book for our 2 year old toddlers who love gymnastics class. This book is cute but doesn't contain a very impressive story line or illustrations. Maybe I'm just picky, but I was hoping for a little bit more. Still a good book though."
2,Uninspired.,"This is a story about some undefined creatures -- not sure what they are but they aren't terribly appealing, and the name ""D.W."" is non sonorous and has a jolting feel that disrupts the story. Despite the book title, there are no flips in the story, only forward and backward rolls, as if the book title was written by someone other than the author."
4,"Flip, Flip, Flip!","In this early D.W. book, ""D.W. Flips!"" D.W. is signed up for a gymnastics class. She wants to do really exciting stuff and is upset that she's been placed in a baby class! She soon finds, however, that gymnastics isn't as easy as it sounds.The illustrations on this early book are different on the Arthur / D.W. books you'll see today. They're more ""rough"" in a way and have softer-coloring. Nevertheless, they possess a certain charm all their own. D.W. fans in particular won't want to miss this."
1,Perplexed,"Why did this company wait three weeks to cancel my order, did they not realize that it would make it extremely difficult to find other items like this at this time of year. I purposely ordered these items six weeks ahead of time so as to ensure I would have them. Now three weeks later, I am back at square one. I wish when orders are cancelled they had to come up with a plausible reason why they canceled"
2,A start,"This was the first Uzbek-to-English dictionary available in the West. The number of words it includes is quite limited, and it will not suffice to read most Uzbek texts. For that purpose, the Uzbek-English dictionary of Karl Krippes, which has considerably broader coverage, is preferable.The Waterson dictionary does have one real advantage, however, and that is that most of the entries have sample sentences in Uzbek to illustrate usage of the words in question, accompanied by their English equivalents. Thus a learner of Uzbek can simply dip into the dictionary at random, look up a word of interest, and see it used in a sentence. This is useful for learning vocabulary, and thus even though the book's coverage is a bit too limited to serve as a useful reference when reading, it still can play a useful role in helping you assimilate new words, especially in the earlier stages of learning Uzbek."
2,Dictionary least of all possible evils,"While there are no ""great"" Uzbek-English dictionaries currently available in the West, Waterson's is the most useful among a group of poor dictionaries. For the individual who is trying to read Uzbek texts without knowing Russian, Waterson leaves you frustrated. Also, dialectical differences are ignored within the entries. In short, until something better comes along, Waterson is the least of all possible evils."
5,perfect for toddlers,I borrowed this video from the library and just had to buy my own. My 18 month old son loves it! The stories are just like the illustrations in the book which makes it very cute. The story is easy for the kids to follow and short enough to keep their interest. There is a cute intro song for each book- which my son loves and dances around the room. I wish there were board books of this series but he'll be ready for real books soon. It'll be nice to get the books to accompany the video. It's a great buy for the number of stories included.
5,Efficiently pleased,"I'm really happy how quick it arrived and how new it looked when I opened the package. Usually the fear of false advertising and having to worry when the package will arrive makes buyers nervous and make them look elsewhere, but there are places that are reliable and are efficient to where they make their customers happy. I like my product and will look forward to ordering more from here."
5,Great Product,"Great product must buy, I have a query does any one know which external flash should i use."
5,Best moisturizer i have used,"My skin is very oily and this moisturizer is so lightweight that it suits me perfectly. I have bought 3 more since i tried this. This does not leave any residue and since I have started using it, I feel the quality of my skin had improved."
3,Does what it says,They don't really sell this in regular stores because i found this at Biglots and i got it for pretty cheap so this moisturizer does what it says its very light so if your skin has flakes it wont cover it up very well so i have to use other thicker moisturizers to cover those parts up but other than that i works great and it also had a nice mattifying effect so you wont look so shiny and once its on it makes your face feel soft and smooth and it doesn't feel greasy at all and if you had just put it on and then touch your face it doesn't rub off because it already absorbed into the skin overall it works good so i would recommend it to anyone who just needs a light moisturizer and it also doesn't break you out
1,Poor Service,"Boy was I shocked when I ordered two bottles of this product from Dhmedical supplies and got two bottles of Eucerin. There was no receipt included with the order, no return label or anyway whatsoever to make a return. Imagine how further shocking to get an extremely nasty e-mail response to an inquiry of how they would like to handle the matter. In all my years of internet shopping I have never been treated so rudely. The entire matter would have been handled if DHMedical would bother to enclose paperwork with their shipments, but they certainly need to work on customer service as well. Won't be ordering from them ever again. Thanks for nothing!"
3,Wanted To Like It More Than I Ultimately Did,I was late to find and appreciate Carcass' music. This and Heartwork are more accessible for the average person than earlier releases. The riffage in this album is tremdendous but ultimately starts to sound the same song after song. Still need to check out the DVD though not an avid fan of extras.
5,I WAS SCEPTICAL TOO........,"i loved the grind-era carcass,but this album was easily their most ""mature"" and ultimately timeless release.i believe that this one will continue to gain respect and longevity after most other titles from the same era fade into obscurity.i hate using comparisons,but think heartwork album with even more melody and maiden-like guitar harmonies.very,very catchy with even some rock elements.trust me,if you take the chance you will have these songs ingrained in your brain for some time to come....."
5,One of best albums from carcass.,"One of the best albums from carcass. It is not as heavy as Heartwork, but it has very good songs. This is a good album, but not as gory and fast as their first 3 albums, but I still give it 5 stars."
2,Doesn't hold a candle to earlier work,"Alot of people either love or hate this lp. I gaveHeartwork a decent write up but this is pushing it forme. Song writing is boring, the lyrics are terrible,the guitar playing is cool and even the production iscool but this is way too mid tempo for my tastes. The musicsounds more like Megadeth than Carcass... If youwant a decent 'new' Carcass cd skip this and get Heartwork.If you like less polish and more emphasis on speed check outSymphonies of Sickness."
5,"Finally, someone with complicated extremely heavy riffs!","I love this music. Black Star is very catchy along with Generation Hexed. A few groups are as heavy (Prong, Pantera, Obituary), but not like this. Carcass has a new and different sound--much more growling bassy guitars! And just because it has hell-spawned riffs doesn't mean they lose their complexity of good thrash metal (Metallica, Megadeth, Pantera). Other top rate songs on this album are: Tomorrow Belongs to Nobody, Cross My Heart, Room 101, Firm Hand, R**k The Vote, and Go to Hell. So, Keep on Rotting in the Free World !!"
3,Extreme mainstream???,"I'm not familiar with their earlier albums but I know they were a lot more extreme than this one which is fairly moderately paced. They have some very catchy riffs and rhythms, and a great crunchy guitar sound. Polarized is an excellent song - a bit of a hardcore-death metal hybrid."
2,"Better than most bands, but still poor for Carcass ...","Let me start by saying Carcass is one of my personal favorite bands, and way cool in an underground way. Once you get into this band you're hooked as you start realizing all the different layers of creativity and occasional bits of genius. With that being said this effort is pretty poor for Carcass. Almost everything that made this band intellectually interesting is gone and replaced with the kind of simplistic music most garage bands can play. Indeed, I've heard this album a thousand times ... from a thousand generic opening local bands.Quite frankly I'm glad they broke up after this album, and a part of me wishes they broke up just before. Don't give up on Carcass though, just get one of the better earlier albums."
1,This ain't CARCASS!!,"This by far is the worst album carcass has ever done. Boring riffs and boring everything. If you are looking for an album that puts you to sleep right away, or forever as a matter of fact, this is the album for you. Heartwork blows this album away by a loooooong shot. I cannot stand one song on this album. This was no album to leave their fans with, I feel so cheated. If you want good metal, check out Micheal Amott's new band Arch Enemy, they bring back memories of the old Carcass. This album REEKS OF PUTREFACTION."
1,Really bad record,"This was an illfated attempt by carcass to capture part of the market for alternative music created by the whole grunge thing. This created the only carcass album that can be described as truly bad. While heartwork isnt my thing, I'll admit it has merits, its a shame this band couldnt have released their first 3 LPs then broken up."
5,This stuff really works!,"I've owned a lot of leather care products, and I am most impressed with the way this product cleans, protects, and shines."
4,03 Highlander v6 spark plugs,"I just Installed these Spark Plugs in my 03 Toyoto Highlander V6, If your not a good mechanic with a good set of tool's I would not attempt this project. The front 3 are easy, the rear 3 is really hard to a access. However if you remove some of the interference such as the speed control cable, PVC valve and hose it can be done. I have 95000 miles on my highlander, the new plugs made the engine purr like new."
3,Works well.,I purchased this because I THOUGHT that it'll give me more boost over my platinum spark plugs but it made no difference at all.
4,ngk bkr6eix-11,Arrived quickly and as stated. It seems as though there is more power than with the previous platinum plug. I found out after the fact that the local auto part store had it for a few bucks less.
2,Trouble in 2003 Camry,"According to Amazon, this should work in 2003 Camry. Well, among all other heavy items, Amazon threw 4 spark plug without any packing material. End result- car shakes at idle and check engine light comes up every now and then. Reset ECU and same thing happened. I pretty much ended a solid part of a weekend troubleshooting the plugs, eventually gave up and put back original Denso plugs and returned these NGK plugs to amazon. 2 * for not giving me any trouble with the return. Got new OEM Denso plugs from local stores and the car now runs as it should be. Moral of the story, don't buy plugs from Amazon. Or if you do, do not place order for anything heavier item at the same time."
5,3 CDs 1 price,This is a genious idea to put 3 badass CDs in a box set and sell it for a low price. If you don't have any of these CDs and you want them get this.
2,Poor writing style,"This book seemed to jump around too much and did not flow with what he was talking about. Also, there are not really any good examples until the last couple chapters so it is difficult to follow what the auther is trying to get across."
4,Muy buen libro,"Muy buen libro avanzado sobre el manejo de arquitecturas, le dedica bastante a la teoria. A mi criterio le faltaria mas ejemplos, pero sin lugar a duda es una lectura obligada para quien apunte a realizar aplicaciones escalables."
2,grammar,"I think the book means well, but it needs a lot of editting. The problem? Bad grammar. I'll make up an example of bad grammar: Horses eat apples from trees so that their population can grow. Which population? Apples? Trees? Horses? Two of three? All of them? This type of poor grammar exists so much with this author."
2,I don't feel this is a good representation of trek costumers,"As a trekkie who has been costuming for years, I did not feel that this book accurately represented costumers. I am always improving my craft. Each costume gets better and better and yet the ones in this book seem very amatuer. There was not much attention given to details. I am ecstatic that a book was done on trekkies in costume. I just think better costumers could have been found and perhaps a little less detail given to the woman's bosom."
2,Below Average Book with some cool pictures,"This book is really like a kid's picture book than an adult reference book. It shows some good pictures (maybe that will give ideas for your costumes) but that's about all it does. It appears that this was some grad-student's project that just happened to get published. As long as it cheap though, it wouldn't hurt to add to your collection if you want to see some examples of cosplay."
2,Costume Art,Star Trek Fans and Costume Art (Folk Art and Artists Series)This book while interesting does not contain any information about construing costumes.
4,GOOD STUFF,"I would not recommend this video for people who pick moves up quickly because they are very basic but for someone like me who lacks any dancing ability, it has helped immensely. For those who have no coordination and would like some these videos are a good plac to start!!"
4,"Good, but could be so much better!","It's not going to fit in your pocket or anything, but definitely is smaller to carry around than those big paper based organizers. The way it holds your PDA is a little odd, but is good enough to make it easy to remove the PDA if you have to....And since their isn't any 'holes' for power cables or USB cables, or headphone cables, you will be taking your pda out more than you'd like. That's my one complaint. Not real easy to plug in anything. At lease there is a window for IR."
2,Slightly Better Than The Original,"This review concerns the revised 1966 edition. Frank and Joe help their father investigate for a shipping line which suspects that the owner of a valuable Egyptian treasure is trying to defraud their insurance company by claiming that the treasure was aboard their freighter, the Katawa, when it sank off Whalebone Island near Bayport. Also, Frank and Joe are haunted by the ghost of a pirate said to have haunted Whalebone Island years ago. This book sounds like it shouldn't be bad, but for whatever reason I never found that I was very interested in it. Very few of the chapter endings left me with the feeling that I had to read more. That said, for anyone who is going to read this title, read the revised edition because it is better than the original, which completely lacked a mystery and was really nothing more than an adventure story."
1,Please note publication dates are usally wrong on this page.,Who ever keeps changing the published date to 1938 on this please stop. Books did not have ISBN numbers in 1938. Also the image provided by Amazon does not match a 1938 edition. This listing is supposed to be for the 1966 edition. Create a new page for the 1938 Edition.
2,Ignorable,"Yellowed paper, charts from the 1980s, reference to a top-of-the-line workstation with a 330 MB hard drive.. The book came out in 1993. It offers fixed-income and derivatives-lite math and market details available in any other book with 'fixed income' in its title, and has, I think, about 20 pages of more original content, including a 5-page discussion of common FI strategies. Is that worth $60? You decide."
5,GREAT BIB! The only one you need.,"I wish I had just bought this bib first when my daughter started eating solids! I love that you can actually get it FULLY clean again without laundering (There's enough stuff to wash for a baby already!)- just use a wet wipe or a vigorous rinsing in the bathroom and it is ready to go. Anyone who has traveled with a nasty used cloth bib in their bag all day or gotten an open velcro bib ensnared in all the other laundry will appreciate the convenience of this bib. The crumb-catcher works great, too. It is especially useful for toddlers learning to feed themselves, because they can get the food out of the crumbcatcher and try again. Would recommend having this always in your toddler's diaper bag."
3,Kids May Not Like These,I feel this product benefits parents a lot more than kids. It's easy to clean but my baby really hates the cold plastic around his neck as well as the added weight.
1,Way to Hard,These bibs are too hard and difficult to store. I found the Dex bibs softer on baby's neck and easy to store!
2,Too much background information,"Meryl Sawyer is usually a good writer, but this book is so slow. She tells us background information on every topic that comes up in the book and since the main characters are newspaper reporters there are many topics that have nothing to do with the main story line. Not only are we treated to information on surfing, internet dating, how e-mail works, how newspapers work (in great detail) we are also given background on recent current events, such as who Martha Stewart is. Anyone who ever turns on the t.v. or reads a paper will know most of this stuff, but the author presents it like a high school kid doing a research report. Plus there appears to have been very little editing because half the time the information is repeated a few chapters or paragraphs later. The plot moves very slowly. Not worth reading."
1,Don't waste your time,"Meryl Sawyer has written some wonderful stories. I loved ""Tempting Fate"" and ""The Hideaway. ""Lady Killer"" is not in the same orbit. The story is all over the place: surfing in Hawaii, newspaper work,female bonding a la ""Sex and The City"", cooking, boyfriends- you name it, And a serial killer computer nerd on skates. Needed editing and Focus. Not worth the time to read."
1,worst ever,I used these headphones only 3 tomes and both ear phones stopped working i was very disapointed seeing this was my cfrom hristmas gift from my son
5,Bounty Hunter Metal Detector Headphones,"This was a Christmas gift for my grandson and he hasn't had much opportunity to use it, but it fits him and I think it will be fine."
5,I like Em!,"Got this item the same week I ordered it. Nice set of headphones for the price. Works very well with the Bounty Hunter Metal Detector I also purchased. I'm satisfied with this product. It's light weight, and does the job well."
3,Metal detector equipment,"This isn't really a review of the product, but just as a warning, don't buy these headphones thinking they're for stereo equipment. These are metal detector headphones - I have no idea what the previous reviewer was talking about..Consider this a fair warning for otherwise dubious equipment."
2,Dumb,I could have return but I do like bounty hunter and I might give them as gift. They work ok and got to me fast.
2,"Head Phone Jack Size , 1/4 Or 1/8 '' Which one is correct ?","(Amazon.com) Review=the headphones utilize a 1/4-inch stereo plug. Then ,(Product Features)State it Utilizes a 1/8-inch stereo plug ?? I am not the best @ Fractions , But I do believe 1/8"" is 1/2 the size,of the 1/4 plug. unless there is some New math fraction formula I've Missed and yes the decimal .25 = 1/4"" . Wade B.Bounty Hunter Metal Detector Headphoneby Bounty HunterBounty Hunter Metal Detector HeadphoneThe reason For The Rating Is Because of the headphone jack confusion ..."
2,bummer,"it is agreat piece of equipment, and works on everything but the metal detector it was supposed to work with."
1,Don't pay this much for cheap headphones,"You do not need to pay this steep price for these headphones. They are nothing special and they are overpricedSearch Amazon, find a product like the four in one, which costs 12.99. These might be great headphones, but you are paying for the name and nothing else.(Feb 7, 2012) I noticed the mfgr lowered the price on these headphones to around 24 bucks. Bout time. Still priced twice as high than it needs to be. But perhaps they listened"
1,bought to go with bounty hunter jr...fyi they are not compatible,I bought the bounty hunter jr for my son on his birthday along with the headphones as the say that they for hunter metal detectors...well I guess they are BUT not for the jr...my son was disappointed because it would have made it much more fun with the headphones on.
1,Does no go with Bounty Hunter jr.,"Bought the Bounty Hunter Jr. Metal detector and the earphones as a suggested bundle, but there is no place to plug in the earphones to the detector."
3,Use them Once,Not seeing any real benefit from any other pair of headphones.Except these are bigger and heavier. But they work.
5,Great Headphones,"I bought these headphones to use with my Bounty Hunter Metal Detector. They do what they are designed to do. They help cut out outside noise and make it easy for you to hear those faint noises that are important when hunting for underground treasures. It takes a little bit of getting used to, but after a few days they are quite comfortable. Remember, they are for use with a Metal Detector only."
3,Bounty hunter headphone,"These headphones have great sound allowing you to here what your detector picks up.Three things I did not like about this product are:1, The cups hirt my ears, they dont fit completly over your ears instead they press down on you ears to seal out outside noise. after wearing them for a while they got to be uncomfortable. i suppose if you have small ears that would not be a problem.2, The headphone cord is not a coiled type and It yanked out of my detector several times when I went down to retreive my targets.3, The volume control is in a location that was not convenient for me to clip it so It stayed out of the way. I had to re-clip it on my pocket several times as the clip tention did not seem strong enough to hold it securly.[...]"
2,Not good for metal detecting !!,"Bought a pair for use with my Bounty Hunter metal detector. On the plus side they are very comfortable and have good sound quality. The cord is a thin wire without coils. The volume control hangs up on everything it gets close to, including the detector. If the volume control was closer to the headphones and it had a sturdy coiled cord, it would be a great headphone. But as it is it is not worth the aggravation."
5,Awesome Headphones For Your Metal Detector,"Very nice headphones here, but make sure you pretty much just want to use them for your metal detector. No base at all, but that's cool. I wanted this for my metal detector nothing else. Highly Recommend."
1,Exide Does Not Honor Its Warranties,"Just an alert. I purchased a top-of-the-line Exide battery two years ago. The first one failed,and was replaced by NTB. That in turn failed, and since NTB had dropped Exide, Exide ""customer service"" told me to select a similar battery and submit the receipt and manufacturing number for reimbusement.Only now, Exide refuses to refund my purchase price -- far less than the original Exide battery -- even though the Exide battery had a 36-month free replacement guarantee.Steer clear."
3,"Beautiful, but Flawed","I love making cakes and thought this pretty item would come in handy. As it turns out, There were several bubbles and scratch marks in the glass (both the base and cover). From a distance it still looks stunning, but I was disappointed in the quality.I also thought I was getting a great deal, but then saw the same thing at Wal-Mart for half the price. :("
1,Tried TWICE....both times item broken on delivery.,"This is, quite simply, an item that Amazon cannot deliver without damage. The product may be great, but it is not packed to ship and Amazon tried twice, but a cardboard box and a sheet of paper cannot protect a large glass item. Amazon refunded the money, but the time and effort (not to mention this was supposed to be a gift) could not be refunded. I am a big fan of Amazon, but I am shocked that they sell an item that they cannot make the effort required to pack and ship successfully."
1,"She's as pure as new york snow, but new york isn't that pure",flashes of brilliance mired by oceans of mediocrity. kim can do better than this.
5,what a debut!!,"Detroit's very own ethnic-fusion dance party. These guys are creative, original, artistic, and they know how to rock the house! Rooted in Eastern European/Romani(gypsy) folk music, they draw inspiration from around the world and mix in some homegrown punk rawk DIY attitude. This record is the next best thing to seeing em live."
2,made in a sweatshop fosho,This jacket looks good from afar but the quality isnt all that great. The zipper broke on mine within 2 days of wearing and there are loose strings coming out all over. The sizing is very european and 3x really means 2x. I wont buy Kappa again Im goin back to addidas and Nike they are much better quality
2,"Haunted World, Captive Women","For the record, this tape contains ""Hercules In The Haunted World"" and ""Hercules And the Captive Women."""
2,Classic Stupidity,"All of the Hercules movies from the 1960's have developed something of a cult following. All are mind-bogglingly stupid, so poorly acted they had to be overdubbed and feature some of the worst special effects in the history of cinema (barring, of course, the collected works of Ed Wood--in a class of his own.) Park, a Mr. Universe and a well-spoken, elegant man in real life, is, like Steve Reeves, exceptionally handsome, but wooden beyond belief. That said, these pictures are worth a quick look. There is something almost touchingly naive in their technical inepititude. Though made by grownups, they reflect the deepest wishes of teenage aboys everywhere. Without fail, Hercules defeats the bad guys, gets the girl and looks incredibly macho throughout. Now that's wish-fulfillment of the highest order."
3,Cheap metal but can be good for first apartment,This baking set is perfect for a person moving into their first apartment and can't afford good baking stuff. Mostly because it is a temporary fix because the metal doesn't hold up very well.
1,NOT HAPPY.,I bought as a gift for my husband and they are still brand new and after 1 or 2 uses have that rust color stain on them and are just light and cheap and bend in the hot oven... cheap and cheap!!
3,You get what you pay for,You get alot of stuff but the quality is lacking....good enough for what you pay.
2,rusty pans,pans are very light weight whitch is ok for the price but when washed from the very 1st time they rust making them a bad buy.
4,Amusing recollections,"If you are/were a fan of the Brady Bunch, you'll probably like this book otherwise you probably won't.This book is a quick read, full of short chapters of Barry Williams' reminiscences of his years on the show.The last portion of the book provides a recap of each episode with some brief commentary by Mr. Williams.This isn't great literature by any means but as I am a fan of the show, I enjoyed this book and read it in one sitting."
2,Lots of errors and hard to read screen-shots,"This book was a major disappointment after having read other Maran Graphic books. There are alot of errors and the screen shots have been reduced down in size to the point where they are barely legible. Instead of putting the related subjects together, the book jumps around. For example, the book should put all of the ""Request"" statements together and all of the ""Response"" statements together. The authors were either in a hurry to get this book to press or just didn't know ASP.Net as well as they should have. You cannot teach a subject unless you know that subject like the back of your hand."
3,"Great Information, too broken up","This book is great at showing you how to do individual tasks with ASP.NET, but fails to bring it all together into a coherent picture of what a complete ASP.NET application should be like. If you want to quickly find out how to do one of the 130 or so tasks that this book covers (i.e. ""Request Single Line Input"", ""Declare a Variable"", ""Work with XML Data Sources"", and ""Using Forms Authentication""), it is explained clearly. It also explains clearly the changes needed to migrate from ASP and VBScript to ASP.NET and VB.NET, from JavaScript to JavaScript.NET, and has plenty of C# examples.I was misled by the title of the book, it's more of a set of building blocks than a blueprint."
1,Lots of errors in the book,"In learning a new language, its imperative that the book is 100% accurate, some of the code in the book was incorrect and caused errors. I emailed the publisher and eventually it was resolved. However, after losing confidence in the book, I can not recommend this book. I can recommend with five start the ASP 3.0 which they publish, which is my most used book, but this dot net version was a let down. If the book gets fixed, I would consider updating my review. The book does have other good information, but since there are no ""bubbles"" that say,, this code is bad, and will not work.. I would pass on this book until the revised."
1,Junk,"I took this for a full month as per instructions. No change, nothing at all. Can't believe I got sucked in. Don't waste your money. I'd give this zero stars if it was possible."
4,Happy as can be.,Not a bad product some increase but I was more impressed by my mood while taking it. Happy as can be.
1,The cushion reeks of formaldehyde,"The smell is filling my living room, and I opened the package five minutes ago.On the positive side, it was fairly comfortable for the moment I sat on it."
3,Can't take the pressure,"This cushion can best be described as ""adequate."" After using it for a couple of weeks it has noticeably flattened. There is still some elevation which lets it serve its purpose but it no longer looks as nice as it did in the beginning. It looks squashed. I'm a 6'2"" male and weigh right around 200 pounds -- not morbidly obese by any definition.I purchased an inflatable cushion from Wal*Mart around the same time as I ordered this one because I thought this one would look nicer in the living room and I'd keep the inflatable one in my office. The inflatable cushion has shown no signs of squashing and still retains the air from the initial inflation. I expected to have to blow it up periodically but I'm happy to report that that hasn't been the case."
4,Some cushy for your tushy,Ordered for the wife and has helped relieve pain due to a broken tail bone. The price is right and we'll probably order a couple more for the car and work.
3,Does not relieve coccyx pain one bit...,"I read a few reviews for this pillow stating that it helped tailbone pain. I have absolutely no idea how it would have done that! I have Coccydynia (which more or less means chronic tailbone pain) and this pillow really REALLY hurt me. Sitting on this felt like it put MORE pressure on my tailbone, which is pretty much exactly what it was doing. I had a feeling I should have gone with one of the coccyx cushions, but figured I would give this a try first. A coccyx cushion has a V-shaped cutout on the back which allows the tailbone to ""float"" with no pressure on it at all. How does this donut shaped pillow NOT put pressure on the tailbone?? Next time I will trust my instincts. This is being returned tomorrow.As for the overall quality of the product, it seemed ok, for the price. Which is why I gave it a neutral 3 star rating. It was very firm, which I personally consider to be a good thing, as it doesn't just flatten into nothingness the moment you sit on it."
1,Poor design limits function,"This foam rubber ring cushion is designed with the top side having an ""egg-crate"" surface. What this means is that the top surface has large ""holes"" in it, much like an egg carton has holes for the eggs. In effect, the cushion has much less foam than it should have, and it compresses too easily when the user sits on it. It does not provide sufficient support for people who need to use such cushions. What's more, this ""design feature"" isn't mentioned in the product description, so purchasers don't learn about it until the pillow arrives and they sit on it for the first time. DON'T BUY THIS ITEM!!!Duro-Med 18 Convoluted Foam Ring Cushion, Navy"
3,As advertized but not what I needed,"The foam ring cushion arrived & was as advertized. However, it didn't relieve pressure from my coccyx area which is what I needed following spinal fusion surgery. I should have asked a PT or OT before ordering the ring. A friend lent me her coccyx cushion (rectangle w/ a ""V"" cut out in the middle of one of the 2 long sides. ) This relieved my coccyx area & I took it everywhere for about 3 weeks following the surgery."
3,Not top of the line,I don't expect this to last very long as it is rather cheap looking & feeling. The foam is VERY light weight and crushes easily and doesn't rebound very fast. The cover is very coarse to the touch.
5,great product,The product has made work in the office more comfortable. No longer having the problems I was experiencing from working at a desk for 8-10 hours a day. Very satisfied customer
2,wasn't impressive,"I thought it would be more puffier and provide more support.Instead it is very thin. Once you sit on it, it disappears."
5,Duro-Med 18 Molded Foam Ring Cushion,This is an o.k. cushion. When sitting on it I feel high and a little awkward. Very uncomfortable using in the car when driving but o.k. when using a wooden or plastic chair.
1,Disappointed,I expected this to be larger than it is (bring out that ruler folks) and more comfortable than it is. The cushion is hard and less comfortable than any chair I would use it on.
3,Lower in comfort than the one made in U. S.,"I have purchased many of this product from my local medical stores before. They were all made is U.S. and the sitting comfort were very good. This particular product made thru Amazon and made out of the country felt like sitting on a rock. Sorry, but it's a fact."
1,VERY Hard,This thing is so hard & uncomfortable I don’t know how anyone could use it. Don't waste your money on this cushion.
1,Duro-Med 18 Molded Foam Ring Cushion,"Never got to use this item as it never arrived. ONTRAC needed a signature for this ""high cost"" item! So, missing the first day, checked the website, saw it was up to deliver one more day, so left a message w/signature and date on front door to leave it. They attempted but no luck.So, really did try it. No use for it now. So returned for credit. Done!"
2,Too Thin,"I had high hopes for this product given the reviews. I'm 35 weeks pregnant and have been dealing with a lot of tailbone pressure that is pretty intolerable after sitting at my desk for hours at a time. I had hoped this cushion would relieve some of that pressure, but the foam is simply too thin and you end up squeezing the cushion down so much that the ring basically touches the seat, rendering it useless. I think one of the inflatable cushions are probably a lot more effective, but I really didn't want to be sqeaking at my desk!"
3,Definitely better than nothing,"I know the title sounds unflattering, but it's true: when I first got the ring and tried it, I didn't see a whole lot of difference. But after I moved the ring elsewhere and sat in this chair without it, I could see that it really did help -- just not as much as I'd hoped. It's definitely squishier than I thought it would be. At first I was thinking I might return it, but once I realized there really is a difference, I decided to keep it."
3,"It's cheap, but it's also cheap.","Low quality foam which compresses too easily under my 150lbs of body weight. So much that I'm still sitting on a hard surface. Works better than nothing, but there are better quality cushions out there."
3,not for hip surgery patients,I bought this for my husband who just had hip surgery and is having a hard time getting comfortable. It actually made things worse....the uneven pressure doesn't work for this kind of surgery. Other than that.......it is well made and would probably serve other purposes better.
3,Donut,This cushion was ok initially but lost it's firmness after a month of use. I would go for a thivker one in the future.
1,musty odor.,The cushion works well. But unfortunately it has a musty odor that permeatesthe whole room it is used in. It has been banished to the garage. Trash next.Aired it out in the sun outside for a whole day with no affect.Smell comes from the foam insert. Not from the cloth cover.
3,"Duro-Med 18 Molded Foam Ring Cushion, Navy","The cushions are not bad, but should be a little higher in the front so you do not slide. Cushions could have a little more padding added to them."
5,Single White Female,"An attractive, successful woman living in New York City breaks up with her boyfriend and decides to ease her recovery by getting a new roommate. The young woman who moves in changes slowly from normal and supportive to psychotic and dangerous, while also physically transforming herself to appear more and more like her roommate. I love this movie. Acting was great, story interesting from start to finish. I also enjoyed never knowing what would happen next. A must-see movie."
5,very twisted but a good movie,it's one thing when you like who someone isit's another thing when you want to be them and take their life over so they can't enjoy itthis movie is creepy pretty much from start to endbrilliant castingsome laughs here and therea very interesting storygreat endingsee this moviethe trailer shocked mewhen I watched it twice on my dvd player it shocked meand when I watch it every time it will shock megive this movie a go
4,She need a room mate,"Sam betayed her, She finds Hedra. She is out for murder, Ally wished she never met her."
1,The roommate murders a puppy--need I say more?,"The events and dialogue of this movie are painfully predictable, and none of the stereotypical main characters are likable. The movie box blurb tells us what's going to happen, and the pictures of Jennifer Jason Leigh and Bridget Fonda (screaming and scared, respectively) don't leave much to the imagination. So much for ""suspense.""The R rating did not prepare me for the sight of a lovable Golden Retriever puppy splattered over the sidewalks of New York after the vengeful Leigh throws him out the window. Seduce the roommate's fiance, steal her clothes and perfume--but cold-bloodedly push her puppy to his death? *That's* unacceptable. Especially since Buddy was the only creature in the film with a personality.To be fair, this really isn't my sort of film to begin with. I only was watching it because I got a box of movies at a yard sale, some of which looked good."
1,Trash,"This is a waste of two hours. Complete trash. Jennifer Jason Leigh is as ugly as a donkey's butt, and the only likable factor of this movie (Sam, the adorable little Golden Retriever puppy) is pushed out a window. I didn't really like it to begin with, but seeing the cute little thing cruelly killed by Psycho-Bitch made me turn it off. A waste of time and money. Get a movie that'll put you in a good mood, especially if you're a dog lover, like me."
3,Good late night movie,"Believe it or not, I'd never seen this movie before. I caught the title on cable over the weekend, and quite honestly, just going by the title, I thought it was a light, romantic comedy ala 'Sleepless in Seattle' or something! Needless to say, I was a bit surprised as the plot unfolded and no lighthearted hijinks ensued! Once I got over my expectations, and accepted that this was in fact a semi-horror film, I was okay, but it took some time to adjust my brain to that concept.That being said, Bridget Fonda does a good job as vulnerable little Allie, which makes the story believable. Of course she believes Hedy's story and finds it difficult to accept the lies once they become apparent. That's the kind of person she is and by the time she's wise to Hedy, it's almost too late. I also liked the switched identity angle. Jennifer Jason Leigh really pulls this off well.Not bad."
1,Truly Wretched Cinema,"Even with Barbet Schroeder behind the camera, ""Single White Female"" (1992) remains a depressing, sickening affair. The ridiculous screenplay defies credulity for a psychological thriller. Jennifer Jason Leigh and Bridget Fonda deserve better than this exploitative rubbish."
2,Good vacuum for a very short period of time,"We were very happy with this vacuum while it worked - but after only a month of light use, the brush axle overheated and destroyed itself. Cleaning a one-bedroom apartment once a week shouldn't be too much for a modestly priced vacuum; there was no apparent damage from anything getting caught in the brush, it just plain stopped working. It may have just been the luck of the draw, since the vacuum was great while it lasted, but there's no excuse for failing after so short a period of time."
3,Several changes need to be made,I use this vacuum to clean commercial style carpets (no pile). I find that it does not pick up the lint & hair as well as it does on pile carpet. Also I am not please that the upper filter & collector are so close. I have found that when empting the container the dirt sometimes gets caught up between the two and it just makes it messier. I am always stepping on the cord. Would like the grip to have padding so it is easier to hold.
3,Good Deal for Carpets,This Vacuum has been a very good deal for me and for my new home. I have tried this on carpets and it worked amazingly. But I didn't find it work effeciently for sofas/furniture/couches. Otherwise I would have rate this product 5 stars after using it for 1 month.
5,STORMTROOPER!,What else is their to say .... STORMTROOPER.I installed this in my truck on the dash so I can roll around town.I wouldn't really say this toy has any educational value ... unless its teaching kids to clone armies and smash rebels in their face!
4,"Mostly hits, a few misses in this comp.","This disc, like most compilations, is a mixed bag. Overall,I'd definitely say that it comes through, hence the four stars. Ihave especially enjoyed ""Return of the Prodigal Son"" by Marc Williams, and of course Paradinas' contribution, ""Summer Living pt. 1"". In the end, you'll find basic drum 'n' bass, some experimental beats and sounds, and a few songs that are just fun (i.e. ""A Hot One""). In so far as a comp. can be a complete work, State of the Nu-Art succeeds. This disc won't often force you to reach for the remote and skip a track. Worth the money. END"
5,Gets you moving!,"I bought this CD because this is the backup band on a Sippe Wallace CD and I think the band's sound is great. It is a fun, happy, toe-tapping group of songs."
1,dumb not useable.,It cant be used for auditions cause it does not give play its from and so on. I was sad
3,"Great story, not-so-great writing","There is no doubt that this woman's story needs to be told. Unfortunately, the way it is told doesn't match what is being said. The first half of the book reads like a college entrance essay, with the themes reiterated over and over and over. Finally, halfway through, when Debrah creates A Place Called Home, the book picks up the pace and moves forward with incredible stories and anecdotes. Ultimately the story is triumphant, encouraging and inspiring."
3,Fat Stupid Ugly,"This book tells about her life and what she has been through. It was slow at times and didn't really keep my interest the whole way through the book. The end got more interesting since she talks about her experience with the children at APCH. I guess it depends on what you are looking for to read from this book. The story about her life cuts in and out and nothing goes into great detail. To me it was more like a list of things that happened to her and lacked details. Overall the book was an easy read and informational, but not that exciting to read."
5,A compelling story of courage and hope.,"I couldn't put this book down once I stared reading. This book is a must for anyone who has ever experienced any abuse or changledge with addiction.It's an amazing true story of a woman who grew up with sexual abuse and not only survived years of abuse and addiction but while healing her own wounds, helped to change the lives of thousands of at risk children and their families in South Central Los Angeles.This story shows the resislence of the human spirit and what one person can do to affect change in a community through dedicated service.I hope this book gets the attention it deserves and I hope to see the author on the Oprah Show one day very soon."
3,Couldn't put it down!,Deborah Constance 's book is a must read for anyone who feels they are trapped as a victim of circumstances. She has risen above her life of abusive realtionships and addiction by changing the lives of thousands of at risk children.
5,A MUST READ,I loved this book from beginning to end. It is an amazing story and impossible to put down once you start. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for an inspiring story.
2,"In fairness, I didn't finish this book","I'm not a fan of conventional mysteries, but I enjoyed the first three or four Rabbi Small mysteries when they came out. ""The Day the Rabbi Resigned,"" though, has tried my patience, and I'm quitting about a third of the way through the book. If I didn't know already that this was a mystery novel, I'd have no clue thus far (no pun intended). Clearly, all the plot is doing is introducing us to possible suspects for the crime that will occur who knows when. No first-time mystery novelist would be this relaxed with his or her plotting. Kemelman is a good craftsman, and ""Resigned"" is definitely readable. But I finally had to ask myself if my time could be better spent, and just how long was I willing to hold out until something, anything, happened?For superior suspense writing (as opposed to ""whodunit"" mysteries), I highly reccomend James Lee Burke's series of Dave Robicheaux novels, starting with ""The Neon Rain."""
2,Even more rambling than most of the Rabbi Small books,"Rabbi Small wants to start a new career before it's too late, and sets his sights on teaching. Meanwhile, an unpopular man gets himself killed in what looks like a drunk driving accident, and the Rabbi takes a detour in his career planning to assist the police.Kemelman is often not my cup of tea, but can occasionally create a book that I really enjoy reading. This one wandered too far afield and had a curious stilted tone in many places. Start with a different book if you want to get to know Rabbi Small."
1,Barbie goes astray,"I have to agree with these other moms. I felt duped, and sad for my girls (4 and 6) who waited with such excitement for this movie. Apparently Mattel thinks a) that tween girls are a better demographic for Barbie - what planet are they on?, and b) that tween girls are mainly interested in material crap and sniping at each other. I surely hope my girls, when they do get to that age, are interested in helping others, living with integrity and developing their own passions. I definitely am not going to let my girls watch any new Barbie movies if the purpose is just to present empty headed ""fashion-forward"" shoppers as role models."
2,Save Your money,"My 4yr old daughter and I are huge barbie fans and couldn't wait until A fairy Secret was released. Having watched all the previous barbie movies serveral times we were hoping for another good story. A Fairy Secret is similar to A Fashion Fairytale in that this is a story starring Barbie as herself rather than telling a story. There really wasn't an age appropriate plot as the story was basically about a jealous boyfriend stealing fairy. The movie didn't flow well at all. It reminded me of a soap opera the way the scenes transitioned between Barbie and Ken. Honestly Ken was the best part of the movie with his small wings and humorous lines. Also, Barbie's voice has been changed. It is really hard to watch a Barbie movie without hearing Barbie's voice. Overall, I was very disappointed with this movie and was very glad I rented first."
3,Eh. Its okay.,"My daughter liked the fairy theme and all but the storyline was a bit more mature than it should be. A love potion triangle? Come on now, she is five."
3,Well...,"In my opinion, this is the weakest Barbie movie. I do not care for it but my 5 year old daughter loves it. It seems to be more of a pre teen, teeny bopper movie. It is full of attitude and my daughter now likes to mimic the characters which drives me nuts!! They are very Valley Girl. We own all of the Barbie movies and bought this one upon release, I was expecting something better. My daughter is/was happy with it though-she'd give it 5 stars. Like most Barbie flicks she is a hero and doesn't depend on the boy-she rescues him :)"
4,Watchable,"Liked it more than I thought I would. Glad there are no ""Skeezites"" or really scary parts. I miss Kelly Sheridan voicing Barbi though."
1,Barbie you dropped the ball on this one,"My girls(7&4) look forward to every new Barbie movie & we have them all! This was a rushed bunch of junk. The movies were getting Sooo good for a while Island Princess, Thumbalina, Princess & The Pauper even I liked watching them. Please get it together your viewers are young & they miss the singing & princess's."
