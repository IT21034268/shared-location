4,"good, but a little too mellow","I've been a Pete Droge fan since I first discovered him with The Thorns. I was able to have a long conversation with him after the concert, and subsequently purchased all of his solo records. I was very happy to see he had a new cd out and quickly got it. It is very good, but not as ""rocking"" as some of his older stuff. It also has 2 brief instrumental songs. Having said that I would still highly recommend this to Droge or Thorn's fans--there are enough very good songs to make this cd worth a listen."
4,Works well,"Manometer and pump were not attached to cuff tubing. Had to put pieces together with a bit of difficulty as rubber hose is very thick and not that flexible. But once pieces are connected, works well."
2,Not durable,"I purchased this to monitor blood pressure while on a medication that could effect blood pressure. Both the sphygmomanometer and the stethoscope worked fine for home use and my wife and I were able to make reasonably accurate readings. However, the tubing in the cuff sprung a leak after less than a dozen uses and the unit cannot be repaired economically."
2,Strictly for home use only,"This product is for infrequent, novice, home users only.. The included steth works ok for BP measurement..but chest sounds/heart beats are almost inaudible. The double tube stethoscope creates too much noise during use. This item has been returned.I strongly recommend:1. 3M Littmann Master Classic II stethoscope (It is a little pricey..but so worth it) 3M Littmann Master Classic II Stethoscopes, BLACK2. ADC Diagnostix 700 SphygmoADC Diagnostix 700 Pocket Aneroid Sphygmomanometer Sphygmomanometer, Adult, Black"
4,good but not the best,i am a personal trainer so i use this often but not as often as a doctor/physician would. however i would not use for exercise testing (only for pre and post exercise measurements). reason being that the pressure gauge is attached to the cuff so if you have arm movement it can be extremely hard to read. the stethoscope that comes with it is also not the best but i can hear the sounds clearly. overall this package is definitely worth the price but as a professional if you can afford a better one.. go for it
4,"Up and down, but overall pretty nice","Metal is very thick, can't even really bend this tray. Beefy. The magnets are glued on the bottom, but one of mine had already come unglued out of the box. The magnet stays on the bottom of the tray just fine with magnetic attraction. Only problem is when I stick the tray on my toolbox and pull it off, the magnet stays on the box. I will have to find some industrial adhesive and attach the magnet back to the tray. Other than that, this is a great buy!"
5,Great Tray,"This tray holds nuts, bolts and sockets like nothing, even upside down. The magnets on the tray are super strong. I will be buying another one."
2,Quality Control!!!!,"Purchased item as a gift for my husband. It was obviously not quality controlled as one of the really strong glue positions was not correct. The one magnet hangs over the side if the tray. The other magnet is perfectly centered. It was impossible to correct and not worth returning. Kind of ruined the gift, usable but disappointed."
5,Great Product!,"Product works great. My father loved his father's day gift! Would recommend anyone to purchase this magnetic pan, and I will even be buying one for my husband as well. Perfect for anyone who works on cars especially, but really is just good for anything that involves little metal parts that you do not want to lose!"
3,"The concert was great, this DVD should've been better","I was lucky enough to witness this concert 2 years ago, and it's more than odd that this DVD only has 77 mins., that's too short for a 5 hour concert. The cuts made on artists like Baaba Mal or Lisa Roxane are a shame. I remember Beverly Knight playing an amazing acoustic sing which unfortunately is not here, nor is the whole set by The Corrs or REM which could've made this DVD more appealing. They also edited Mandela's speech, in a clear sign of disrespect. My advice: if you have gone to the concert buy it, it will bring nice memories despite all the cuts, if you haven't look elsewhere."
1,Ironic & Mediocre Concert- Africa Mostly Edited Out,"This is a mediocre concert. Don't the let the title fool you- there is almost NO Afrcan music on it at all (!) & the performances by the Brit-poppers are lackluster at best. Baaba Maal fans: avoid this DVD- they limit his appearence to 52 seconds- while REM/Corrs get three songs each (12-15 min.)! This DVD is marred by colonialist editing- ironic, eh? Apartheid lives on the DVD."
4,Does the job beautifully.,"Let's keep it real-if you are ripping the hair out of your body by the roots, it's going to hurt. At least the first time, when it's thick and coarse and all grown out. If you don't like pain, don't buy ANY epilator. This one does the job great without a high cost. It takes out the hair. Start at the bottom with a LIGHT, circular touch, and work your way up. Take a break if you have to the first time. Yes, you may have to go back over areas, you have to with ALL epilators. If you keep up with it, the hair is sparse, light, and lightly rooted. After the first ""shave"" it really doesn't hurt. But this epilator does do what it is intended to do-it pulls the hair out by the roots. It's corded so you don't have to charge it or worry about running out of a charge in the middle of epilating. My first epilator was the original epilady, my second a remington, and this is my third. I am very happy with this purchase."
5,WOWness!!!,"I just got my epilator in the mail a few days ago. I had never used one before and was scared it would hurt. Guess what... It was quick, simple, and clean. I had previously mostly waxed and shaved, but this was so great. I already did my legs and underarms. Its so easy to use. It even gets the pretty short hairs. I'm just upset that I hadn't ordered one sooner. I wish i knew about this when I was a young teen. Of all the epilators i've looked at online and in stores this one had both excellent reviews and a low price. And with a three year warranty its even better. What's so great about this epilator is that you can actually see the roots on the hairs so you KNOW its pulled by the root... and it doesn't even hurt... Try it you'll LOVE IT."
4,True to its name - gentle!,"I agree with most of the reviews already posted on this item. I've been using epilators for at least 10 years and found this one an improvement on the last one I had purchased (Braun Silkepil), which was quite satisfactory (I had to substitute it after over 5 years of use because the cable was damaged). Emjoy Gently Gold Epilator is true to its name - it's very gentle and I managed to use it even on my own most sensitive areas, i.e. underarms and bikini.I didn't give this product 5 stars for two reasons (from my personal experience):1) the shape of the epilator makes it difficult to extract hairs from some areas, in particular the knees2) it doesn't always manage to grab shorter hairs (even if mine were more than 1/4'')- so it takes a bit longer than with my older model.Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase - and it costs less than a visit to the salon!"
1,WASTED MONEY,My wife almost broke my head with it.She use it once and slam it on the floor like Shakil O'Neil so I can't even return it.It seems that those ratings are B.S. The dam thing is useless...
4,Very Funny and Lots of Fun,"Maybe I liked this book better than others do because I have parents who are real estate brokers. The protagonist is a woman agent in Florida's shark-infested real estate industry. She makes a deal with the devil and the saga which ensues is very funny. Heller also uses the somewhat worn-out idea of her finally closing in on a love relationship with the guy who has been a thorn in her side from high school. However, Heller's humor carries the day and this is a good evening's light entertainment. The real estate and Florida parts of this book are dead-on accurate and hilarious. The romance aspect is ok but there is nothing you haven't read before there."
4,As funny as her other books,"I have read three other books by Jane Heller, and this one is just as funny as the others. I really enjoyed Barbara's character. Some of the devil scenes were a little sappy, but for the most part the book was very humorous and a fun read."
2,Infernally boring,"I only finished this book because I had no other reading material at hand. The story is silly, the romantic plot predictable from page one, and the promised humor is nowhere to be found. It features a pitiable Devil and a God that has nothing better to do than to sit on the heroine's sofa. Gee whiz..."
2,Weak book that relies on stereotypes for fun,"Jane Heller seems to have grown tired when she wrote this book. Relying on fat jokes, sexism and devil cliches for it's superficial fun, this book leaves the reader sorry that Ms. Heller did not go deeper into her psyche for inspiration. A talented author with a fun sense of humor but the book is not her best."
3,A decent beach book for the 40ish set,"Jane Heller rights about women not quite a certain age. Luckily these women are successful, witty, intelligent, and capable. I find this very refreshing, as I am hard pressed to find novels where the heroines have these characteristics.The story here however is a little thin. I did not enjoy this as much as I enjoyed some of her other novels. The male characters are a little one dimensional, and I feel I've seen them a thousand times before. And for a fresh approach to the ""husband leaving wife for a younger woman"" scenario, I found the ending too predictable."
4,Too funny!,"Unbelievably funny, completely illogical, well written... what more can you ask for when you want an easy read that will entertain you. Heller is a great entertainer!"
2,Devilishly Unsatisfactory Reading,"I really enjoyed ""Name Dropping"" by Jane Heller so I went looking for more of her novels. Do not waste your time on this one. I could barely get through it. The plot sounded clever enough-wishing for a better life the main charcter gets caught up in a deal with the devil she does not want; but it just did not work. The characters are annoying and the story not only is unbelieveable it is boring. Skip this one and go for ""Name Dropping."""
1,Hilfiger Briefs,The leg eleastics are far too weak! I remain happy with these same briefs that I purchased a couple yearts ago.
5,Every seller financer and note holder should read this!,"Eddie Speed quotes the seasoned Texas banker who said, ""The best time to worry about a loan is before you make it."" Then he details how to do so. As a note broker, I can recommend this book to anyone considering seller financing. Whether you plan to collect payments for 30 years or you want to sell your note at some time in the future, this book will help you create a note that is more likely to be an asset you can sell instead of a life time headache. This book is a guide for the creation of the note and a reference for managing it. It even has helpful ideas for what to do when things go wrong during the life of the note. This book proves that good things come in small packages. Every note holder should keep it handy. I plan to."
3,Phyllis Hyman Review,this is a great CD to listen to at the end of a hard day.Very smooth and relaxing.
2,Compilation after compliation..geesh,"The music ok just to clarify is 5 stars, but yet 2 stars is for the record company and there need to constantly reissue greatest hits of artists with one and two bonus gems. Why not just put a all new material out. Over all the cd is good. You get the single edits of Loving you Losing you and Living in confusion. The sound quality is superb, yet to me just another greatest hits packages. The two unreleased tracks are just OK. Nothing special."
5,A Hard Day's Write,"Write the way you talk so your writing sounds natural. Think of the reader's background and level of responsibility: make it easy for the reader to figure out why you are writing and what you want. Be concise and to the point: back up ideas and recommendations with facts and opinions. Fight writer's block by working on orderly flow and by making sure that you know all you need to write. Marcia Layton's humorously written, logically organized and well-indexed COMPLETE IDIOT'S GUIDE TO TERRIFIC BUSINESS WRITING jumpstarts just about every kind of writing around. Her book puts into practice Edward P. Bailey's THE PLAIN ENGLISH APPROACH TO BUSINESS WRITING, Robert W. Bly and Gary Blake's THE ELEMENTS OF BUSINESS WRITING, Richard B. Loth's HOW TO PROFIT FROM READING ANNUAL REPORTS, and Maryann V. Piotrowski's EFFECTIVE BUSINESS WRITING."
4,BRILLIANT BLUEGRASS OLD STYLE,"Displaying a mastery of old style bluegrass Seldom Scene produces a captivating album from start to finish, with only a slight lag in the middle. From the harmonizing verse of 'If You Ever Change Your Mind"" to the spine tingling rendition of ""Long Black Veil"" Seldom Scene captures the true allure of rural American roots music. Makes you feel down home and Dixie fried all over!"
5,Highly Recommended,"Fantastic book! I'm always on the lookout for good books on Autism. This book not only helps you understand the disorder in a better way, but also offers some really good ideas on how to make life easier, transitions more smooth, and difficult tasks easier. I have found Future Horizons to be my one-stop source on Autism/Asperger's information. The book ""Ten Things Your Child With Autism Wishes You Knew"" is also a must have."
5,Awsome!,"Terrific ideas! Very creative suggestions on embracing it's presence in our lives and how to successfully work with these individuals. Great guidelines to understanding the limits of their world such as: sensory issues, overload, communication, limited interests, and interaction with others."
3,"1 and 2 star people, please, relax...","Those guys who ""hated"" the book and have ""been there and done that"", please relax.I also have a child that has been diagnosed with ASD and I am of the mind that even if I get one idea - yes, even one idea - that can enrich his life or help me to teach him a new skill then whatever I have to do to accomplish that is worth it.So, I'll ask you, isn't it worth the chance to do this for the one you love? Isn't reading this book worth it for the inexperienced parents among us?Don't put off other parents who haven't ""been there and done that"" or minimize their experiences by saying you ""have a real son with autism"". It's not only insensitive, but it's insulting to all of the parents who face similar issues on a daily basis."
5,So far so good,Prompt delivery. I have not read the book yet but I think it is what I was looking for.
3,Beware blank pages,"I just bought this book, the content is what I was expecting. But the pages 160-161 are blank... :-S"
4,Mother of newly diagnosed son with PDD,This book gives great ideas for someone who wants to get started helping their child without knowing a lot about therapy. It's an easy read and has great ideas to start implementing them to your child right away.
1,stale chocolate,"the chocolate is obviously old - it is stale and has lost color and taste; I am stopping the subscription because of it; it wasn't just one or two deliveries, every time it was consistently of lower quality than the one we buy in the storeDoctor's CarbRite Diet Sugar Free Bar, Dark Chocolate, 3-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)"
1,Tastes great but...,This stuff has a massive laxative effect. I ate less than one fifth of a bar and was in hell for four days. I have had other low carb chocolate that did not have the same side effect. BE VERY CAREFUL. Your butthole will thank you.
4,Useful study guide,"Are the logic puzzles your Achille's heel on the LSAT? Then this is the book for you.Work through the problems in this book, and the actual questions on the test will seem much easier. The examples in this book are much more difficult than the actual test. I do not think you will ever learn all the catagories of questions and identify each one definitively, but that is not the point of your studies. This book will challenge you and make the process of thinking through the logic puzzles much easier.The book only gets 4 stars because it surprisingly contains several typos and one wrong answer. I would expect a study guide to have no mistakes.This book had a definite impact on my score. If you take the free LSAT practice exam and score less than 150, then this book is probably not for you; purchase a more generalized study guide. This book is for the people that want to get the highest scores and accepted at the best rated law schools."
2,Too complicated,"While this book does cover all the material for the Logic games portion of the LSAT, the book complicates the material to a point of confusion. In order to remember all the set-ups they use, you would have to study for months. It is a good source but I couldn't get my head around all the different types of games they explain. Try somethig else if you are having a hard time with the games, this will only complicate matters more."
1,Not a shred of logic,The questions are really poorly framed. The actual GRE questions are nothing like the ones you'll find in this book.
1,Shoddy product,"Gave this system to my daughter for college; it stopped working within months, and was too much of a hassle to return. I think I would buy an item like this from a local vendor next time, in case of the need to return. Not recommended."
1,Broke down acfter warranty expired,Great sound and price shaddy durability as it broke down two days after the warranty expired glad its no longer available
4,My Daughter Loves It,We purchased this as a gift for my daughter. The fact it plays dvds is a real bonus. Very few IPOD docks offer the dvd function. Now she has much better sound while watching dvds in her room too. I rated this item 4 stars because the sound control does not offer separate bass and treble adjustment functions. My daughter doesn't mind. She loves it. This item is a very good value for the money.
4,Best One I Seen so Far,"This is one of the best ipod dock I've seen so far. Plays cds, dvds, mp3s, radio, and ipod music or video. Excellent sound and appearance. The muti features are great. I have to admit I was a little hesitant to purchase this items because of the reviews I read. But I took a chance and I'm glad I did. The only set back to this product is that the volume defaults to 17 when you turn it on. And the display light is a little bright at night. One thing for sure you don't have to worry about a night light. There is no way I can see to dim the display light. Over all great product."
5,iLive IHM8816DT Home Stero System is awesome!,"I purchased this system for my 15 year old daughter. For the price, you cannot beat it. It has great sound quality and works great with the iPod and as a DVD player with her TV."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,I bought this for my daughter for christmas and believed it was a good value until I turned in on. The radio reception is very very poor. There is a hissing noise no matter the channel. I tried a CD and still the sound quality was poor. I would strongly advise not purchasing this item.
2,Not Worth The Money,"The only thing that is cool about this thing is all the things it can do.....now if only it did them. It will charge my ipod and play it, but when it plays my Ipod it automatically starts it from the first song on it, not what I put it on. And my Ipod started malfunctioning after being plugged into this system. The remote went out within the first week. It will load up DVD's but you can't play them. It will go to the menu and then doesn't let you play anything. So all I got out of this was a am/fm radio......not worth the $120"
5,This thing is awesome,"I just bought this and I love it. It plays cds, dvds, has a radio, an alarm clock and of course plays any iPOD as well as any other MP3 player and it charges them at the same time. The only downfall to this it that you need to buy a separate cable to display your iPOD info on your t.v.(but it includes a cable for your dvds and cds) but its too good to not give 5 stars."
2,Hissing and Beeping Noises!,"I recently bought this item because it provided exactly what I was looking for: a small system that allowed me to listen to my iPod, the radio, and CDs. The unit is cute but the interface isn't exactly user friendly. With time, I could get over that. However, there is a constant hissing noise that also has a constant quiet beeping that goes along with when the song title scrolls across the screen of my iPod. No matter what I do, I can't get the hissing or beeping to go away...and so the unit is going back."
1,save your money!!!,"I bought this system for my husband to use with his ipod. The sound quality was poor . . .really muddy, especially when the bass boost and ""subwoofer"" were enabled. I tried unplugging the sub woof and the sound was then tinny and poor. I ended up returning it to the store. We're still on the ""hunt"" for an economical but great sounding system . .. this wasn't worth it."
1,Returning This Device,"I am returning a recently purchased ILive ipod base (item # gpxicr6806dt) because this item in new condition has many undesirable issues with sound quality (beeping, poor reception, missing ipod adapter B, etc). I bought this as a gift and am very upset that you would sell a product of such low quality. I've read your return policy noting that ""Shopperschoice"" will be unable to refund the shipping charges- and feel compelled to tell you that I will be unable to make anymore purchases from you again in the future. Please understand that I do generally enjoy doing business online and regret having to inform my friends of your low quality products."
5,Great Item,I got this for my CNA class-I liked that it came as a set. Everyone in my class who tried it liked it as well. The stethoscope is very sensitive and the cuff is easier for me to use than the kind that has the D ring. A great set at a great price!
2,not worth it,The cuff was fine but the stethoscope was horrible. I'm in nursing school & it was no where near acceptable. It reminded me of a childs toy. Def would NOT recommend.
5,Works,I ordered this combination kit for my son who is taking EMT Class after Fire College. These items are a requirment for the class so I am glad I was able to purchase a set. My son says they work fine and he has no issues with them. Great price and fast shipping.
3,"Good price, mediocre performance","I only needed this for a nursing class and it was fine for that purpose. You really need a quiet place to use it. Would not recommend it for professional use, but I doubt anyone would use it for that anyway."
1,would not work,i purchased this set after reading all the positive reviews. stethescope did now work at all. terrible product. had to return it for a refund!
3,wild rockabilly!,"I like the first three songs on the album tremendously, also track number 9 is pretty good. The rest of the CD is a little too funky for me. If you like traditional bluegrass this isn't your style. I love Dwight Yoakam but Peter Rowan is even more far out than Dwight. I bought the CD for track 1 & 3, I love the songs. If it hadn't been for those 2 songs, the CD would not be worth owning. This is my first Peter Rowan CD so I can't compare it to his other work."
5,excellent product,"This product works great for me. The effectiveness in removing hair on my legs is about 95%. This is as good as conventional waxing, but suprisingly, not as painful! I don't have the nerve to use it on more sensitive areas, but thats ok, because smaller more sensitive areas can be tweezed or shaved in no time. I'm so pleased to be free of prickly nubs on my legs! BTW, it's even better with use of Kalo hair inhibitor spray or cream."
1,HURTS LIKE HELL!!,"I bought this to use to remove excess facial hair. It doesn't work very well, and on top of that, it hurts like hell to use it. I only used it once, and probably will NOT use it again, even on a less sensitive area."
4,Good One,"I got for my wife, She said its nice and better than waxing. She was using Philips for last 7 years , and compared to that its good or same. Definitly Good deal for this price .I am not giving it all 5 because it makes noise and is having curve that can make her press hard on skin to get better results."
5,Worth the money,"I ordered this so that I wouldn't have to keep shelling out the money for waxing. I was unsure how well it would work and a little scared that it would be worse that waxing. Boy was I WRONG. This epilator is so easy to use and while it hurts a bit, waxing hurts worse. Just follow the instructions and make sure to use a very good lotion right after use. I had a ton of little red spots on my legs after using this but I rubbed in some good lotion and within 3 hours the spots were gone. This morning my legs look better than they have in years."
2,"Okay, but not worth the time!","I bought this to remove hair from my face and neck, as I have a lot of blond and dark hair on those areas. Although it removed most of the hair, I developed red bumps (think: terrible acne or measles!)all over the areas where I used the epilator. I used it on my legs next, and it worked okay, but it left a lot of hair. I had to go over areas several times to get all the hair. Overall, I would not recommend this product- it is too time consuming for the legs, irritates my face, and leaves a lot of hair behind."
3,Ow it really hurts!,"The product itself was in great condition and does really work. I hardly use it though b/c the reality is that it hurts like heck. You know the whole point where it would be almost impossible to give yourself a tattoo b/c of the pain factor well apply that to pulling out your unsightly hairs. It works best on the legs if you have the time and patience to pull every little hair out. Even for the face it works pretty good but MAN don't go down there, if you know what I mean. Yikes! Anyways, I don't know how the words ""gentle"" and ""caress"" can be tied in to this product, that's a bit misleading. Try it for yourself, though, if you've got the time and the pain threshold. :D"
1,Pain and Wounds,"I bought this epilator thinking I would have beautiful, hairfree underarms, legs and bikini line. No such luck. This product HURTS! And to make matters worse I began getting ingrown hairs. Then the ingrown hairs got infected and now my underarms and bikini line are hairy AND have scars. Don't get this product!"
2,I was very disappointed with this model.,"I have read great reviews of Emjoi epilators. I've been using epilators for 10 years and was searching for a new one as my 6 year old braun silk epil is wearing out. I have read that emjoi is less painful and quicker so I decided to give this model a try.The curve of this model is very difficult to use since you need to really press the product against your skin and the curvature prevents you from getting close enough. I tried doing one leg for an hour, it was quite painful and hardly picked up any hair at all. I grabbed my 6 year old Braun and it worked so much better with hardly any pain. I cannot wait to get a newer braun model. I can't even imagine how well an updated model will work for me considering my old one works so much better than this Gently gold caress."
4,No pain No gain,"I understand all of the gripes about the pain that this causes, but in the end it is worth it. I never used anything that did a better job of removing unwanted hair. I have very dark and coarse hair, so I have tried many things to get rid of unwanted hairs, but nothing has ever gotten them under control like this. Years ago I got one of the first Epilady models. I thought that the idea was good, but I have never used anything more painful in my life. It just wasn't worth it. I was pleasantly surprised with the Emjoi because not only was the pain bearable, I actually quickly got used to it. Every time I use it I have to go trough the initial shock, but then it isn't too bad. The added bonus is that I find that some of the hair doesn't grow back at all. The only reason why I cannot give it 5 stars is because I find it hard to clean. I would definitely recommend this model to anyone looking for an epilator."
1,Unimpressed with product quality and results,"I have owned this epilator for only 6 months, and have to say I am very unhappy with it. Since the beginning the rechargeable battery would not hold a charge, which I figured was no big deal since the cord is nice and long. But over the last month I noticed that it is not pulling out the hair anymore. I have never been able to get it to pull all my leg hair without breaking a great deal off in the process, and so had delegated it to getting strays after a leg wax and for my upper leg and bikini. Now however, it pulls on the hairs several times before actually pulling them out taking quite a bit longer to remove the hair than it did before. While I don't normally mind the discomfort of epilating, torturing me by yanking on the same hair several times it just WRONG! After researching other epilators I am going to order a Braun and throw this one out."
5,Lt. Commander Geordi Laforge,"Very nicely done figure. Likeness to Levar Burton is high. If your a TNG fan who collects figures than this is a ""must have."""
1,Not what is pictured,When I read the review that said the item sent was not the item pictured I should have listened because that is exactly what happened. The item sent to me was much smaller and did not fit my vacuum. I needed the one in the picture but that is not what was sent. The cost to mail it back was not worth it so I am out the money and still do not have the part that I need.
4,Heaven is Heavenly,"Actor Diane Keaton made this unique little gem, way, way back, consisting of some really strange ancient b&w ""heavenly"" footage, and interviews with all kinds of folks regarding their personal views on sex in heaven, angels, God, and all stuff celestial. Particularly notable is the two guys arguing about how one can believe that God exists, in regard to how one can believe that they actually have a physical brain in their head, even though none of us has ever actually seen our own. Brilliant argument!"
3,'Heaven' Can Wait,"Eccentric is the word for this documentary. Diane Keaton's interviews are much more interesting than the insterted stock footage and strange music which makes it hard to become involved with the subjects. However, 1987 was a more experimental time, and it was her first foray into her own style of filmmaking. If Diane Keaton as Annie Hall is your favourite character, I think this would be Annie Hall's way of making a documentary-decidedly odd. La-de-dah! For a more standard documentary made just two years later covering a similar subject I suggest 'The Big Bang' by James Toback. I would suggest watching 'Heaven' first, though, as it is not your normal interviewer-subject talking head type of documentary. Rather, like Diane Keaton, it's in a class all it's own."
1,Waste,"View once and throw away. The only item worth telling is a man recounting a conversation between his mother and father.Father, ""I'll sit on a rock and wait for you ... It'll probably be a gold rock.""Posturing and dogma; Life-is-hard"" rants by broken people; Forced discourses by people not really interested. The movie clips seemed meaningless to me. Self indulgent film making?"
1,Beautiful but beware!,"I bought this cutting board last year. The more I used it, the more it began to smell bad. I had oiled it carefully before use and when the odor began, I tried bleaching it, sanding it, scraping it...nothing worked. I finally had to throw it out. It is a beautiful board and if you can figure out how to keep it clean, you may like it, but I am now using a wood fiber laminate board and I like it much better."
2,Nice... until it cracked and customer service blew me off,"I got this cutting board last Xmas. Loved it for 6 months... until it started cracking at the seams. Now there's a millimeter crack in one corner. I emailed Totally Bamboo to ask for a replacement. They told me since I did not purchase it directly from them (my husband bought it through Amazon), they could not help me even though it's clearly their product - I emailed them a photo of the crack and the ""Totally Bamboo"" logo burned into the side of the board. If Totally Bamboo is going to take food away from panda bears, they should at least produce quality bamboo products."
4,Autumn in Moscow,"This is the movie about a man of thinks of himself as a victim of circumstances, but in fact his will is just not strong enough. He cannot make his own choise, and when the destiny decides for him - it turnes out to be the worst way out of the situation. It's a very thought-provoking film and it has a deep pshycological problem. A little bit depressing, though. But still good."
4,Pleasantly humorous,"Could have been titled ""The Salmon"", as the main character is a master of maneuvering through the eddies and currents of a demanding circle of people in his life. He lies almost unceasingly and in a skillfully benign manner to make everything go smoothly. He also has a great capacity for calmness, and when he finally can tell the truth, albeit briefly, the result is the same, sparing the recipient just enough to keep things acceptably tranquil. I found it amusing and really quite even in all aspects of the filmmakers craft."
5,Must see,"I won't bore you with my analysis of this movie. Chances are, if you are reading this, you have seen it. If you haven't, you must. Whatever one thinks about the merits of depicting mundane life in movies, one must at least appreciate the wonderful acting. This is a timeless classic."
4,Very Nice!!,"A beautiful smooth gospel reggae album! My favorites are:Server the Lord, Have Mercy, You Can't Be a Beacon, We Thank Thee and The Books of the Bible. I can't wait for his next release!"
5,Amazing,"This is the first book I came accross that is dedicated to 1/72 scale armour models. It presents a good coverage on the common variants of the famous German tank (Panzer IV). The models presented in the book were constructed with painstaken blinding details (these models are only about 2 inches long!). The book explains many techniques, such as casting and painting, to produce the details in the the models. I recommand this book to any serious modeller who is interested in the small scales."
5,A Dream for Small Scalers!,"This is the first book that deals with assembling many Panzer IV variants in 1/72 scale. Mr. Clark shares with us his knowhow concerning assembling, gluing, converting, painting, detailing and scratchbuilding many Panzer IVs in many stages, from the beginner to a master modeler. Colour chips and some pictures from a Wirbelwind variant are included. Definitively highly reccomended to everyone interested in 1/72 scale armor."
4,Not sure I know the solution,"Michael Brown expertly analyses the weakened state of the Church, and the absence of the power of God the Holy Spirit in its life and ministry. Perhaps a bit more guidance to Pastors and lay people alike for re-capturing the favour of God the Holy Spirit in life and worship would be helpful. Maybe that's not an opinion others would share. Excellent read"
1,Very Dissappointing as to content.,The title suggested that this dvd would portray an intimate glimpse into the personal life of Elvis through the remembrances of his best friend. It is a redo of many previous movie clips and snapshots. I felt as though I had seen this dvd before in many of the previous vhs tapes about Elvis that I own.
5,good looking ring!,"This is a very handsome chainring, from the polished teeth to the discreet logo etching; all top notch. I don't really know what could go wrong with a chainring, but this is straight and even, and the pins do a great job of picking up the chain from the inner ring. I was replacing a non-pinned ring, so the improvement was really noticeable. It is also quite lightweight."
3,Most sought after if you are trying to get away from MS Office Suite,"Hello,This product would be very good if you are just starting to use Open Source software. I have been using open source software for a few years now. The reason I purchased this is because the title stated it had updates & support. I already had the most recent version of the OpenOffice suite, so I was unable to use it. Luckily, they bent a rule about returning open software/cds, dvds & let me return it with a full refund. Thank you very much.HowardJ"
4,A FUN ADVENTURE FOR DR STRANGE FANS,"Being a huge Dr Strange fan its hard not like it - a bit of a new take on the good doctor with quality art and storyline - considering the dearth of material recently, its worth the money."
2,NOT PORN,These movies are terrible in the acting but most of the guys in the movies are pretty cute. The movie's dont show any erections so if you think this is some porn its not. Everytime they show guys messing around they dont show the penus. If you like to see guys prancing around and kissing then you would like these movies to watch not to listen cause their acting is terrible.
5,Filling the Gaps - Placing Women Back Into Hisory,"Ana Historic, in a nutshell: -is written in non-conventional prose, free of the common uses of character development, punctuation and linear plot movement -attempts to include the impossible- to write women into history -Daphne Marlatt uses evocative imagery and detail to portray small moments of time that revolve and fold in on itself-forming a whole for the gap that cannot be filled in ""normal""patriarchical writing"
5,Fantastic,"Rarely do you seem to see D20 supplements on really new and unique options for fighter types. This book is full of them. Absolutely fantastic.The heart of the book is the combat maneuvers. It's a toolkit of options to build new maneuvers (like disarm, sunder, etc. - only they are much more varied and interesting).Also included is a new race, the Ironborn, a golem-like race. Very tight rules and very flexible (for instance, you can choose which ability score modifiers you get).And while I generally have little use for new feats for D20, the three new types of feats in this book are so well put together and so interesting that they have made be want to include them in my game.Overall, a fantastic supplement."
3,You can see the proto-4e from Mearls,"The combat manuevers in this book are actually pretty good ideas but you can tell that there's an early 4e martial power vibe to it. But, that's ok because the martial powers are one of the best things about 4e hands down. I've been trying to come up with ways to adapt 4e martial powers to 3e fighters and rangers so this book helped inspire some creativity. Also, the ironborn is a nifty little idea and in my opinion better than the warforged of Eberron!Overall this a good book."
1,My First Review of Any Product,"If I'm spending my time writing this than it must be really bad.I left this thing on for a week on full blast and it barely made a dent.The cartridges dry out, and I doubt its even worth the electricity."
2,Too Loud,Got this as a gift and noticed right away that it was way too loud and the only way to stop it from being that way was to tilt it upright or beat on it. It was not just my unit either. My sister had the same problem with hers. The discs are virtually obsolete in the store now so you either have to order them online or look on e-bay. Sorry...not worth it in my opinion. Glade Plug-in's work better than this.
4,Cannot find the scentstory discs anywhere!,I bought this product a year ago. The product is great. The only thing I have an issue with is that I can no longer find the discs here in Maine. What's up with that?
3,Bionaire BSSP101-U Febreze Scentstories Player,The Player is very good it really kicks out some nice smelling air. I think it works better in a smaller room then a larger room. Other then that it is a great product.
4,Febreeze Scent Stories Player,"I am very pleased with my Scent Stories Player. The fragrance is pleasing and lightly fragranced, not overwhelming and heavy with the scent. I do wish the fan was just a bit more quiet. Overall I am satisfied with the product. It quickly adds fragrance to a nice sized room."
5,Wonderfull Item,"I purchased this item and it met every expectation. I absoultely love Febreze. I placed it in my son's room. He even likes it, his room is very fresh."
5,Pleasant fragrance and long lasting,"We recently moved into a new home and have to use the finished basement as a bedroom for our 2 boys. The sellers had two dogs and apparently let the dogs use the basement for their home because it smells like wet dog!! I bought this SCentstories contraption hoping it would help mask the odor (along with shampooing the carpets, cleaning, scrubbing, etc) and IT DOES! I love the fact that this tiny machine can cover a whole room with a very appealing fragrance (I have all of the little scent discs) and it shuts itself off after 2 1/2 hours. I have been using mine since Aug 05 and it still works fine and all the discs are still usable. Definitely worth the value!!!"
3,Glad I have one,"This is a cool looking little item, that will definitely garner questions from your guests.I don't like having a plug air freshener on all the time because the smell just sits so heavy in the room. I find this a great way to deal with stong odors like deep frying, or wet dog. Because the scent changes over time it keeps it more natural rather than like you are obviously trying to cover something. Overall it does a very good job of working as advertised.The reason I didn't give it more stars, is there just aren't enough variety where the scent discs are concerned. I would like to see at least twice as many, and would love a baking themed one.I would also like a nice storage unit to hold the scent discs."
3,Don't buy from her website,"In febraury, Ms. Lazenby personally emailed me about some new DVds that she was creating. I had initially emailed her to compliment her on All the Right Moves. So I purchased two workout packages and they never came. When I initially made the order, I emailed them after a couple of weeks and there was a reply. Then I emailed several more times and no reply. Now it seems as if her website is not so easy to find anymore, so maybew several people have been screwed over. So I am telling everyone: DO NOT BUY FROM THE WEBSITE IF YOU CAN FIND IT!!!!!!!!"
2,Not super powerful magnets,"Quality seems to be decent, though the magnets are not as powerful as described. I was going to return this item but I am going to go ahead and give it a try. The reason I was going to return it is because my buddy has one that I put 50-70 nuts on IN A PILE and they all stuck, even upside down.BUT, I will still give this one a try, and alter my rating depending on performance. For those interested, I am a turbine mechanic and do field machine work."
1,Look elsewhere,"I'm on my 2nd (replacement) DSS-8+ and this one has died, just like the other (port 6 stays lit even though nothing is plugged in, and devices can't talk through it when they are plugged in). I think this will be the last D-link product I buy."
4,Nice,Bought this one because my son fell in love with the teakettle at PBK which is crazy expensive. He still plays with it over a year later. A few parts of the kettle have fallen off but he doesn't care. It works well for the money. He doesn't play with the toaster much but it still works as well.
1,QUALITY IS TERRIBLE! THE TOASTER BROKE WITHIN ONE DAY!!!,It is a very cute set. My grandaughter used the toaster one time and you could hear the part break off inside the toaster...needless to say we where both very upset. If you just want to look at it on a shelf..it's great. If you actually want to play with it..well...I would not buy this product.
4,"Great ""play"" kettle and toaster","This is so cute, my daughter loves it, it completes her stainless steel kitchen set. Looks ""real"", for tons of imaginative play. The toaster comes with toaster pieces that ""pop"" up when done. I would recommend this for anyone who wants to complete their child's kitchen set."
5,Fabulous planters,"I bought this on sale and have to say they were a great deal. Look exactly like the picture, are well-made, solid feeling (good weight to them) and look great on our front porch. We just planted in them so not sure how they stand up long-term but they do look and feel like they will be a great addition for a long time."
2,The product is a great product - yet this used one was not functional,"You always take the risk of purchasing a used item, yet in the back of your mind the hypothesis is that the life time may be shorter, not necessarily that the product does not function as designed. This anemometer receives all it's input from the small propeller, yet after several days of blowing air through the prop, it would not spin until there was at least 300 fpm; probably still useful if one were to stand outside measuring straight line winds, hurricanes or tornado's. It went in the trash about 4 days after receipt."
1,Bound printouts from the web!,"The blurb on this book promises an in depth look at mobile agent technology, with example code. In reality it offers little more than a behind the times look at various agent architectures, this look apparently taken verbatim from the various company web sites. The chapter on Telescript, in particular, (dropped by General Magic in favour of Odyssey!) is a direct copy of the material available on the General Magic website. I appreciate that the author states that the material is presented by the particular framework author, however I object to paying for material which is free to anyone on the web. This book won't teach you how to write mobile agents, and isn't a particularly good book for research. Incidentally the score of 2 is given as I have yet to examine the CD, should this prove as disappointing as the book then the rating should be considered 0."
2,Not new in condition,"PRoduct was at a good price, but condition was that of a used product. Product arrived in old, beat up packaging. Main visible part of handle was scratched and outside housing of deadbolt was badly scratched. My guess is that this was an item that was returned but sold as new."
3,Good quality and looks great,This is a good quality product for a reasonable price. It was easy to install and looks great.
4,Wow.,"If you like uplifting trance (like me) you'll love the second CD. It's simply amazing. It is by far the most listened to CD in my collection. The first CD is totally different, however. I don't listen to it much, but it isn't bad, just a lot darker; and, well, different. I suppose someone else might think the first CD amazing and the second CD just ok. I don't think too many people would find them both favorites because of how different they are.In any case, it is certainly worth getting if you can find it cheaper than here ($35 is an awful lot to be satisfied with one CD...)."
5,One of the best Russian suspence films !,"I loved it than , love it now . A must se film for everyone , interested in world sinema !Russian Civil War is over ... all the combat friends - survivorsget on with building "" new "" Russia ... need to learn to live by the new ( civilian ) rules . The train with a lot of gold been robbed . The gold was ment to be used to buy bread abroad for the starving Russians ... 2 of the friends was framed for the robbery ... the other ones had to arrest them . One of the framed desided to escape to proove to his buddys - he didn't do it . But now it is not anouph...now he need to get inside the local partisan gang to find the gold ... Cann't tell you more - watch it .But it is not just the story itself ... this film has so many unpredictable twists , such a good directing and camera work ! It defenatly deserves second place after "" White Desert Sun "" ! And just to se Konstantin Raikin shaved head already worse the price of this DVD !"
2,Just stick with Farnsworth,"The format of this book - just a long series of Q/As - wasn't nearly as helpful as a good hornbook. After a semester with Pearls of Wisdom, I've found that I've almost never turned to it for help. Stick with Farnsworth's excellent and creatively entitled ""Contracts"". It's basically just an expanded version of what your class outline should look like. I review Farnsworth every day before class and it's made an enormous amount of difference.Skip Pearls of Wisdom."
5,Just what I needed!!,"I have had such hit and miss strategy with most cds these days, when something as good as this comes across my cd stack, I am honored to be a part of the music.I don't even know the category of music that I seem to like - Switchblade Symphony, Birthday Massacre, Butterfly Messiah, Collide, Opera Macabre - all of them are hauntingly dark and melodic, a little dance-y, sometimes with a twinge of rock.This goes right up into my top ten!"
2,Poor quality,Well what can I say. I got what I paid for. The case is flimsy and cheap and protects almost nothing on the phone. Avoid
4,Tchaikovsky's Greatest Hit,"My interest was the Spike Jones offering, the rest for me is padding. Nostalgia played a big part in my enjoyment of this CD, so if you are under 45 years of age and not enjoyed some of this kind of nonsense, this is a good place to start. One of my favorites (check spelling)."
2,Not what I expected,"I expected the story lines to be so-so. However, the lack of actual conversation or noise BEYOND the hokey 70's music was too much. Music should be in the background, not the focus."
4,A fairly good book that goes into depth about body building,"Like the other Joe Weider books, there is alot of information about bodybuilding for either the novice or the advance. However the pictures are misleading, because one cannot get the same result without using drugs."
2,Confusing? Possibly,"Although Mr. Herberman is an excellent horseman and very obviously knows what he is doing and talking about, his book makes riding and training horses sound much more challenging than it needs to be. Most of the subjects in the book would be very clear in the first paragraph. Mr. Herberman wrote this book with good intentions, but this book is not for the beginner or even for most more experienced rider. It requires a good amount of paitence to sift through all of the necessary and unnecessary explanations."
5,Very pleased with my Kodak easysharp camera,I am very pleased with my Kodak Easysharp Camera. It is every bit as up to day and easy to handle. Instructions are easy to read and understand.
1,"If this camera was my employee, I'd fire it!","When you hire someone, you expect them to show up for work. When you buy a camera, you expect it to power up. This camera only shows up for work when it feels like it. Sometimes powering up, sometimes not. New batteries don't help. Very frustrating! Some other people had the same problem. Guess I got a lemon. We'll see if Kodak repair can fix the problem."
5,I LOVE my new camera!!!!,"I have really enjoyed my picture share digital camera, I took it with me to travel the islands, and the pictures were amazing!"
5,Nice Camera,"Good pictures, simple operation. I bought this camera for my wife because she doesn't like the complicated camera I have and did not want to learn to use it. Her only complaint is that it doesn't have an independent view window, but it is hard to see how they could fit one on a camera of this size along with the big review lcd on the back."
1,"Doesn't work in ""USB Mode""","I just bought the Kodak C613 Easyshare Digital Camera, picture quality is ok unfortunately it doesn't work in USB Mode with Windows XP SP2 so I am forced to use the slow & horrible Easyshare software to transfer pictures, which is an absolutely painful experience. I just don't get why this camera doesn't work like any other digital camera where you can just use windows explorer to move or delete files. (USB Mode)Ohhh... and Kodak support is terrible, they just leave me waiting and waiting, with no answers on how to set this camera to USB ModeI'm returning this useless camera to the store right now.Staw away from it if you value your time, you've been warned....."
3,Not bad for the money,Camera is awesome. takes great pictures and works flawlessly. My only complaint is that it appears very slow in between shots.
3,Camars,I received the product within two days of ordering it just in time for my little one to start walking. The product was use but in okay condition. It didn't come with the attachments I guess not all use products come with everything just make sure you read the product details to see what is included.
4,Nice camera for the money,"This camera takes nice pictures and is easy for a ""newbie"" to operate. The only thing I don't like is the shutter botton is so small~~guess I have to get use to that!! Otherwise I would recommend it."
1,Bad product,"This is a bad product. Spend the money on a better camera. After a while you have to turn it on and off several times to even turn it on. Put in new batteries in the camera then went to take a picture, and the camera turned off. When you zoom in sometimes the camera shuts off. Save the money and buy a Nikon."
1,Kodak uses Quick Time video,"These Kodak Cameras only produce The quick time videos, which is an Apple Product and does not work with Windows Movie Maker. So I can not download to Youtube. Very dissappointing!!"
1,Kodak does not stand behind their products good luck if you have a problem,"Nothing but problems. If you purchase a kodak camera get ready to purchase another brand. I purchased a kodak camera have sent it to kodak to be fixed for freezing up a couple times while under warranty, they never did fix now 1 month passed warranty they won't stand behind their product. The kodak supervisor said it's just not his problem. Now trying Samsung and Sony. I do not recommend any kodak camera. I like the picture quality, but it freezes up and you can't reset it. Worked literally 3 months and it's garbage. Kodak used to be good, but not anymore."
2,Too too basic,I bought this camera a few months ago but have not used it much as I bought an HP a short time later. They were both about the same price. ( I know it was less than the current price.) One good thing is you can import images into the Kodak and view them on its screen. That's the only good thing about it.I bought these two cameras because the lens on my Kodak DX6340 wouldn't retract.The HP is much better. It's a Photosmart R847. You cn do more than crop the image. You can change the image to a watercolor or sketch. Before you buy this Kodak check out the HP R 847. The viewing screen is huge. Only thing I don't like is you can only view images you took with the camera on the screen.
2,An okay item for a beginner,"My boss bought this camera for our communications department at work, and it's the fourth Kodak camera I've had experience with - and my least favorite so far.My biggest complaint is that this camera has VERY poor color. I have to edit everything in order to use it for our newsletters. All the pictures turn out very dark and grayish - partially due to the poor flash. If you were to buy this camera in hopes of capturing precious memories of your children, I think you would be disappointed. Outside photos would probably be fine - but inside photos have been very poor.The limited zoom is also a hindrance."
4,Simple point and shoot camera,"Great camera for the price. It does everything a camera should, and then some. It is small, however not small enough the comfortably carry in your shirt pocket though. Because of this, I only give it 4 stars. But on the other hand, what do you expect for a $120 camera?"
1,Kodak EasyShare C613,"LCD viewer failed on first day of use. As instructed by Kodak, I mailed the camera to Texas for repair. It has been more than three weeks now and I haven't heard a thing."
1,My first disappointing purchase on Amazon,"I bought this camera for my 15-year old daughter for Christmas. Since it was her first camera, and given the price, I didn't have high expectations for stellar performance...however, I did expect it to work. The first camera did for 1 day and then stopped turning on. We ordered a replacement and it stopped working after two days. Defective product?? Appears so...I see that others have had the same problem. I figured with the Kodak name attached I would have no worries. I guess I'll stick to Sony and pay the extra money -- its worth less hassle."
3,its okay,"This camera is nice, it gets me a lil confused sometimes especially when i'm transfering pictures to the computer, i'm sorry i didn't go for more MP's though. Over all its okay."
2,Horrible indoor pictures,"There is no excuse for a digital camera in this price range to be outperformed by a comparable camera from 2003. Every single indoor picture I took with this camera came out grainy and dark. My older 3.1 megapixel camera from four years ago took much, much better pictures until it broke. I'm going to have it repaired and return this piece of junk."
3,Poor indoor photos. Don't buy if you use a lot in low light.,"I've had this camera for 2 years now. I bought it to replace an earlier version of the Kodak Easyshare that I loved. I was disappointed in this camera. The features are great & it is very easy to use, but if you take a lot of indoor photos, don't buy it. My indoor photos come out grainy & yellow at least 75% of the time. For outdoor photos, it is a good camera. The red eye correction in this camera is poor. With the red eye flash turned on, I still get red eye in almost every photo. Most of it can be corrected with software, but sometimes it won't correct & it is very time consuming.Overall, if you want a camera for low light situations, make sure you ask someone that has used it first. This time I went to a professional & asked for a good replacement. We went with the Nikon Coolpix S8100. I haven't used it yet, but the reviews look great."
5,AMAZING,"I bought this camera thinking it was just a fairly cheap camera just to take pics of myself or outside scenery, i was thinking why spend 200 bucks on a camera ,ill try the kodak , its a old brand, well wow was i surpriesed this camera is really worth twice the price the pics are rich, colourfull, and outstanding, believe me i have owned another brand before and boy what a difference the kodak makes. trust me you wont be disapointed with this camera, just point and shoot , images come out perfect. i would reccommend this camera to any one novice or expert. it s also filled with features for u to choose from if u like to get the perfect shot or just set to auto which is what i use 90% of the time. kodak really impressed me here."
4,Good for the price,I bought 8 of these cameras for work and they work fine for the quality of picture we are trying to take. Do not buy the dock it is more trouble than it is worth. Also this camera would be better if it used a standard cable to connect rather than the cable with the mini adapter.
1,"Twice bitten, third time... new camera","Bought this camera on a Saturday, by Tuesday stopped working completely, wouldn't turn on. Took it back to the store, staff tried with no luck. Exchanged camera for the same model. Second camera took 46 pictures then wouldn't allow review of pictures that were taken, then while investigating that, refused to turn on. humpf."
4,MISLEADING PHOTO,"THE PHOTO IS VERY MISLEADING. If you don't read the fine print below, you won't see that you're getting only one filter. Yet the dealer shows 4 filters. There are other dealers selling 4-packs. But this photo is very misleading. Please change your photo to show only ONE filter so someone, in a rush, doesn't make the same mistake I did. Unless that is your aim. In which case Amazon should monitor your account. This review is not for the item, it is for the way it is posted."
1,What a piece of junk!!!!!!,"This thing never worked right. It will play the first song from my media center and then replay the same song. It recognizes my media player and will list all of the albums but when I try and play a song it says it can not connect to the meadia player. Avoid this junk. I will never buy another LG product again. Oh, and by the way, even if you have a warrenty on it they want $75.00 just to look at it, and of course, you pay shipping both ways."
4,DVD-DVR W/ MEDIA CENTER,"ITS A LITTLE HARD TO SET UP WITH OUT SOME KNOLDGE OF ELEC. AND NETWORKING. REMOTE WORKS JUST LIKE THE ONE FOR THE PC VERSION OF MEDIA CENTER. DVD LAGS SOMETIMES, ALL IN ALL GOOD MACHINE FOR THE PRICE, I WOULD BUY AGAIN IF!! ENJOY!"
2,Research before you buy,"I didn't buy this from Amazon but I tend to do some of my reseach from reading reviews here, so... I actually did a fair amount of research and the 160GB hard drive and ability to hook it up to my network were big selling points for me. But while I like my LG cell phone, their DVR's leave something to be desired (at least this model). Had to return the first one because the colors were off with component cables and the picture was black & white when using an S-video cable. I tried in total 3-4 sets of cables (that work perfectly fine with my other components) so it wasn't the cables. Called the 1-800 tech support number and the woman was less than helpful. Returned the first one and got a new one, same problem with the S-video cable and the colors and picture brightness flicker with the component cables. Computer created videos formatted as letterbox will also only play in full screen mode. It's going back tomorrow and I'll be looking at another brand."
2,Ok,I bought it worked great but it stoped working so I wanted to sent it back to get fixed and the shipping was costly and they gave me a new unit but it stoped working.
4,Great DVR/DVD recorder,I bought this recorder because I needed a hard drive recorder instead of a VCR. It works great and will do things I never thought of. You can burn DVDs from programs off the cable tv. It also has upconvert to 1080 on the DVD player and takes HMDI cable. Price is great and product is great.
3,Excellent features but HORRIBLE customer service,I absolutely loved this DVR. Several of my friends have DVRs that do not compare to this product. I especially appreciate the fact that I do not have to pay a monthly service charge in order to get the program guide.After having it for about a year it began to power-cyle on its own an stopped reading a lot of DVDs. I called customer service a few times and that's where the dissapointment began. LG has great ideas but needs to put some focus on their customer service.
1,Is this for real?,$15 for a real dud of a product - it is about the size of a 6-inch sub. Completely unfathomable. Cheap plastic-y feel takes Made in China to a new level.
1,Not what I expected...but I didn't read the specs closely.,"Wow, I thought to myself that this would be a great thing to have at work and use to get some circulation going in my legs. I could get more circulation and exercise by just lifting my feet up and down by themselves.I guess I was looking for more of a resistance and an energy burner, but this product really is just for helping circulate blood and to keep your ankles from swelling.The plastic doesn't look like it will last over a long period of time, the product is small, and does not have a lot of flexibility."
1,Onlyh because 0 stars was not one of the options,"A silly, silly, product. Its going back today. Waste of money. I should have believed the reviews I read. It is exactly the same as sitting and tapping your toes. This unit simply supplies an annoying noise."
2,Meh.,"Set and costume design was top notch; however, this whole play was quite a hyperbole of a performance - too dramatic, too exaggerated, distasteful."
1,Laius - Aieeeee!!!!,"We viewed this movie in our English 12 class subsequent to our reading of the play. The class felt that Oedipus the play was a very powerful and rather chilling explication of ""unintended consequences."" The movie, on the other hand, failed completely to capture the horror of what occurred on the stage. The movie is on the level of other notoriously bad movies such as ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" and ""The Room!!"" Rather, the curiously affected speech and overdone gestures steered this compelling tragedy into a hammy comedy!"
1,Worse Oedipus video,"The actors in this video are wearing full head masks, and they shout their lines rapid-fire so it is nearly impossible to understand them. The stage is tiny and the actors move around the stage too much. At one point, one actor threw himself into the other actors and my students burst out laughing at them. I stopped the film and we went on into classroom discussion. This version is useless in the classroom. If you use video in the classroom, do not waste your money on this version."
2,NOT What it Once Was!,"I have used this product as a last resort but it does not work the way it once did. The company, Gaia Herbs, USED to have a similar formulation called ""Lomatium and Osha Surpeme"" but they decided to remove the herb Lomatium from the mix. Losing this vital compound took away some of it's power punch to eliminate viruses caused by both bacteria and fungus. I can honestly say that using this product AFTER the formula change, I felt like I wasted my money on a watered down version of the original.Eclectic Institute, another herbal supplement maker STILL makes a Lomatium and Osha compound. That company apparently still cares to offer the best to it's customers."
2,A neuron to pick,"Leponcin's book needs work. I picked this book up hoping to invigorate my mind but found it lacking. I like the exercises, but her system has holes. For example, she gives the reader a set of exercises to complete inside a time limit. Then the reader scores himself based on quickness and accuracy.Leponcin provides a table of times to measure performance:All correct answers in under thirty seconds 3 pointsTwo correct answers in under one minute 2 pointsOne correct answer in under one minute 1 pointWhat if I score one correct answer in forty-five seconds? I guess that garners a zero. Thus, the smartest thing I did was to throw this book out."
2,Inconforme,"Este producto vino de mala calidad, estaban muchos oxidados desgastados. Se parten con mucha facilidad, no duran ni cortan bien"
2,They break... a lot,"I bought these for the metals class I have been taking at my college. We had only been doing basic things such as piercing and these blade would break very easily. A lot of the time I couldn't even thread the saw with one without it snapping while slightly tightening the frame. Other times they would snap shortly after beginning to saw. I thought that it might have just been me since I was an amateur so I let my professor have a shot at it and even she found them unusable. She has used the same saw blade for all her projects for over a month.Do not buy these, they are not worth the money."
5,dressage exercises,"This is a terrific book, very simply designed and expressed.It has given me a large number of ideas for warm up, planning my sessions and the exercises to improve my dressage skills.I just have to make the time to get on with the exercises now."
4,101 Dressage Exercises,Received quickly and was in perfect condition; great experience ordering from this vendor. I would order from this vendor again.
5,Helpful for Western Riders too,"Even though I ride western, 101 Dressage Exercises has helped me create more lift and forward motion in my horse while retaining flexion. I especially liked the chapters describing different stretches and massages beneficial to your horse. I also recently bought the author's DVD, which is also really helpful. It goes into more depth regarding work-in-hand, and helped me pay closer attention to my horse's muscular development."
5,This compilation rocks!,"It is now 2004 and I still listen to this CD which i bought back in 2001... it's that good.True, it has a lot of commercial dance tracks, or maybe even pop on it.. but I feel that here in Canada this stuff doesn't get air play on the radio or the mainstream clubs anyways so I could care a less if it's considered pop in England. I have to say, for Seb Fontaine and friends the mixing is nothing special really, but seriously.. throw CD1 on (if you're a trance fan) and you'll love it, Energy 52, Bedrock, Solor Stone..etc. and CD2 has wikkid club tracks ranging from disco house to pounding club.. definate 5 for this CD!"
3,"Practical examples not convincing, lack of benchmarking","While the book is easy to read and not too technical, the applications investigated by the authors are too simplistic and not really convincing as to why we should use advanced techniques. It would have been nice to add an additional, more detailed chapter comparing the various implementations of data mining techniques by software companies (SAS Entreprise Miner, Clementine, Insightfull Miner, etc.)"
4,Great Information!,"This is a very complete (large) book on data mining. Any questions that you may have, this book will answer them!"
3,OK Book,This book - has a lot of content - all with quite good relevant examples.Where this book fails is - in its technical details. This is probably a good book for managers - who need to know the basics of what this whole thing is about.This book failed to impress me - since I am a technical person - and would like to know the technical and details about the techniques discussed - of when which technique is to be applied and why and - also how the technique works.The coverage of the book is very good - it has a lot of material to read - but at the end of it - I felt still sort of void - that I did not sink in too much - of why and how we are doing all these techniques and how it gives the answers to the relevant questions.
4,Very Interesting book,I'm very interesting in Data Mining and i think that this book is a good introduction to this field. Thanks Amazon
1,Not mathematical enough.,"Very disappointing, if you're looking for a mathematically oriented book. In fact it avoids math like the plague. It's therefore ideally suited to: (a) project managers who don't really want to do any serious work themselves, and (b) people who want to drop words at cocktail parties to impress people. Totally unsuited to the serious researcher."
2,Too many unnecessary details,"While the authors provide a very comprehensive overview of data mining, they do go into too many details and as a result many critical points are lost. The authors are clearly motivated and therefore they discuss all they know in data mining. They should have selected some of the key points and elaborated on them."
4,Great Overview,Everything from medical issues to types of jump aircraft used. You can't get any better than this! The book looks at a lot of issues involved in skydiving and parachuting. I don't know if I'll ever make that first jump myself but this book will definitely be a factor in making that decision.
5,Te Dare Lo Mejor (CD) review,Te Dare Lo Mejor (CD): Wonderful music. Arrived promptly. This music is heavenly and very upbeat. I am glad I ordered it
2,I don't get it?,"I read all the reviews, I read the opinions, I bought the camera, and honestly . . . I am not impressed. Regardless of whether or not I take pictures indoors or outdoors, everything just seems off. Pictures are yellowish, off-color, and often even somewhat out of focus. Beats me... I am not a professional photographer, but by no means a novice. If I were you, I would buy a different camera. Quality should not have to be sacrificed simply because you are using a digital camera."
5,im impressed,"my dad got this as a family camera, but i think i use it the mose. i've never used a digital camera before and i learned how to use it really fast. its idiot proof! not only is it idiot proof, it has great resolution like u can zoom in the picture and practically see someones eyes from like 30 ft away. you can also do little video clips which i thought was cool. but the only bad thing is it doesnt zoom in and out very much, but the zooming in of the photo pretty much solves that problem."
5,This is it,I received this camera as a christmas gift from my Mom. It's light and very easy to use the basic functions. I haven't ventured into the other options yet but I'm looking forward to doing so.
2,Bad picture quality,"I had a Fuji 2800 and I was pretty happy with it. It produced great pictures and I used it a lot but it finally broke after 2 years.I did some research and I saw good reviews for this Sony camera and liked the compact size and the set of features. I bought it and did some pictures indoor of my daughter. Next day I connected it to the PC and downloaded the pictures. Big surprise. The pictures were grainy, yellowish and out of focus. Way worse than my old Fuji. I tried to play with the settings, do some pictures outside, read again the manual. I got better results outdoors but still not quite right.Really disapointed with this camera. I returned it back to the store and I ordered something else.Take my advice and try to see some pictures taken with this camera before you buy it."
5,Good 3MP entry level digital camera,"I've had a Canon Powershot S330 and recently sold it in order to upgrade to Sony's Cybershot DSC-P8 model. Before making this particular purchase for myself, I've purchased it for someone and was particularly attracted to this camera's compact size and lightweight. Beyond that, everything including the menus and navigation were OK although I still find that Canon's operations are much easier. However, the most attractive feature of this camera is how silent the operations of its lens, particularly when zooming in and out, as compared to Canon's S330 noisy lens operations. I seriously recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for a compact point-and-shoot digital camera."
4,8 YEARS AND STILL GOING,I've had this Sony Cybershot camera for 8 years now and it still takes great quality photos. It has been on many family vacations and taken thousands of photos and it still works great. For the size and price it has lots of features and takes excellent photos. I would recommend to anyone who wants a great little camera but doesn't want to spend a lot of money.
5,wonderful shoes,"top-notch quality. $40 is a great price. I would have willingly paid for twice as much in a retail store. Everything is just perfect. These really are waterproof, but have an appearance of regular light hiking shoes. Extremely comfortable, making me want to jump and run. But the color is much darker than the picture shows. Not a problem for me at all. These are true to size."
3,broke,I recived it in the mail and the plastic part that holds the pepper was broke. It went to my old address even when I put in the new address.
5,Looked forever to find a peppermill like this....,Finally a pepper mill that doesnt kill your wrist and holds the ground pepper in a container. This is the greatest pepper mill EVER. I plan to buy half a dozen and give them out as holiday gifts!
3,Hasn't Aged Well,"I started out loving this peppermill, with the one caveat that it did not put out quite as much pepper per grind as I would have liked. The container on the bottom is a great idea. The problem, now that it is a year old or so, is that neither the container on the bottom nor the lid on the top will stay on, so it's turned into an aggravation. My next one will be the Magnum Plus by Unicorn, based on a recommendation from a local chef."
5,great item!,"I love this mill. Easy to use, and so convenient to catch the pepper in the attached cup. Holds a lot of peppercorns, and has adjustable grind. A must have!"
2,Almost Perfect,What's right with this:-compact size doesn't take up too much room and isn't too tall for a cupboard-nifty compartment at the bottom to catch the freshly ground pepper (great for measuring)What's wrong with this:-the plastic gears have worn out so very little pepper gets ground (let's not think about if I am grinding the gears themselves into my salad now?)-the knob will chip your thumbnail if you don't keep your thumb out of the way when you twist it. Took some getting used to.I'm going to try the one with the ceramic gears and hope it lasts longer than a year.
3,Too broad range for an environmental issue,This book presents a broad range of environmental analysis. We have a brief introduction to the problem. The best way must be a focus in quantitative analyis of specific environemtal problem
4,Great Value,Get three sexy erotica titles for one low price. This was definately a good purchase. Three dvds full of sexy nude men.
1,"Run, don't walk, away as fast as you can!!","Had to give it one star because system would not accept zero or minus. Absolute misrepresentation of what the advertising claimed. A complete waste of three DVD discs. I will NEVER purchase merchandise from Amazon again. There were three discs in this package, plus I ordered two other DVDs. They all met the absolutely lowest standard of quality, content, and delivery of advertised product. Amazon should be held liable for false advertising."
5,original rado,"fue mi primera compra con amazon no hablo ingles pero fue facil, rapido, seguro y fue exactamente lo que ordene.Me lo entregaron directamente en mis manos y se que es original el producto ya que tengo otro igual hace 22 años.LO GARANTIZO AMAZON ES LO MEJOR PARA COMPRAR."
3,Pedometer,We purchased 16 pedometers. All of them are still working except for one. Now the question becomes how do I figure out how to send out one item and is it really worth the effort?
5,Accurate and easy to use pedometer.,"I am very pleased with the Accusplit Eagle 120X Digiwalker pedometer. You can buy more complex pedometers that measure other data but if you just want to count steps, it is accurate and easy to use. I also like the clips that come with the pedometer. They keep it securely attached."
3,not accurate,"It's easy to use - and that's a big plus, but it's not accurate. I tested it quite a few times and it is off by 10-20%, walking on level ground --- it reads too high. I suppose that doesn't matter that much since it's easier to subtract 10% and get a rough idea of how much one has walked and how much to increase.I tried the Omrom, but the battery consumption was outrageous -- and then it stopped working. This is an adequate and simple alternative, assuming the battery does last."
5,Great pedometer,"This is the first pedometer I have even owned. I wanted something simple. I just wanted a pedometer that counted steps. This is perfect for me. It is light, durable, easy to read, fits nicely on the waist of my pants (shorts, etc.) and is slim and not bulky underneath my clothing. I originally found out about this model from Prevention Magazine. I have been very pleased with this product."
2,not special,"I researched the web and magazines before I bought this pedometer. It was highly recommended. #1 opening the case is IMPOSSIBLE! I have broken two nails trying to open it, opened the back instead, and dropped it[as a result of which, the battery dropped out and I lost the day's data]. #2 I don't think it counts steps any better than pedometers in the same price range found in any store."
2,I finally gave up,"I'd heard this was a very accurate pedometer but I tried it out (there's no calibration which should have been a tip-off) and it was WILDLY off my steps. The last pedometer I had matched my steps very well as soon as I calibrated it to my stride. I liked this one because not only was it inexpensive but it has a closing cover so you can't accidentally reset (a problem with the last one I owned) but it also had a leash so you weren't likely to drop it.I returned it, thinking this particular one was a dud, but the next one I got was the same. So I am going to try an Omron HJ-112, which is a little more expensive but has the leash I wanted and a friend swears by it. So we'll see."
1,AK,This is sitting on a shelf. I like that the case closes so you don't lose count-the trouble is getting the count. It is very picky about where you put it to get it to work correctly. This will not work well in my front jeans pocket. I had another kind that worked great there but I would sometimes lose the count soI thought I would like a case that closed and decided to give this one a try.
2,I thought I was buying the real digiwalker,I thought I was buying the Yamax digiwalker pedometer. This is not the real deal and not accurate. Why 2 stars? It came quickly and well packed.P.S. I finally got the one I meant to buy in the first place.
3,one ok one not,"One of the pedometers worked perfect, the other one you could not read the numbers so I am not sure if it was working or not. Of course I lost the sales slip, and I washed the one that was working perfectly. So I am trying to use the other one and guessing steps. I gained some weight so I must be guessing too high."
1,Too Touchy,This product is WAY too touchy. Sometimes it works....Sometimes it doesn't....Can't trust it. Should've gone for something BASIC and alot Cheaper!!!
5,Does What It Says,"Counts your steps pretty accurately, but its up to you to walk;) Good for the price, and the extra attachment so it doesn't get lost is a plus. It saved me from loosing it a couple times."
5,Accusplit Eagle,"The company I work for offered a very similar Accusplit pedometer for free when we began a program to get our employees to be more active. I broke the clip on mine and have since tried several other brands of pedometers, but so far, it seems that this one is the most accurate of them all."
5,Great and Simple To Use,"Very simple to use pedometer. Just one button to reset to zero and away you go. I also like the way it opens towards you to see how many steps you achieved. Well priced, simple to use, and not too visible due to its small size and black case."
5,Pleased with the Accusplit AE120XL,"Simple step counter with a cover - so it's not accidentally reset to zero if you lean against a counter or carry something. Small, so it doesn't look like you're wearing a shoebox under your shirt or snag on stuff. Comes with a tether, so unlikely to fall off and disappear. Best of all, it seems to keep an accurate count of steps."
1,died in two weeks,"I was fairly pleased with this for two weeks until it died. I guess the battery failed. Also, it comes with a plastic fastener on the safety line. It doesn't hold well. They also supply a metal fastener because the plastic fastener is so weak. Unfortunately the metal fastener is large and constantly pokes you. What a waste of money."
3,Not made as well as before,My husband and I have been wearing Accusplit pedometers for about 8 years and have been pleased with the accuracy and durability of them up until about a year ago. Since then we have bought new pedometers (also Accusplit) to replace our old ones that finally konked out and they are not at all accurate in terms of counting steps. My husband's runs too low and mine runs too high. Plus they don't seem to be as sturdy as they were in the past. It seems Accusplit isn't as great as we once thought they were and are disappointed in the performance of our current pedometers.
3,pleased with product,Completely satisfied with product except it is very difficult to open case to see how many steps have been taken. I have another pedometer like this but it opens easily. Must be a quality control problem.
4,Good tool for health & fitness,"Ordered 28 of these pedometers for participants in our church's 12-week Health & Fitness Challenge. One of the participants has one and recommended this type. Everyone seems to like the pedometer except 2 did not work properly. Could be they were not set properly, however they seem easy to use and operate. Most everyone is amazed at how many steps they walk each day. A great tool to begin or maintain a healthy lifestyle!"
5,One of my favorites,"I listened to this CD repeatedly when I first bought it, and, after about six months, I still listen to it regularly--it has worn very well on my ears. All of the songs are fresh, peaceful and well sung. As one with strong theological and artistic sensibilities, I feel that von Trapp reset Newman's ""Lead Kindly Light"" spledidly. To boot, I have played this recording for numerous friends, all of whom, in their diverse tastes, gave rave reviews. This CD is a must buy."
3,Pleasant but not satisfying,"No more beautiful voice could do these songs more justice. However, a better poet could have produced much better lyrics, and a better composer could have produced much better songs. Elisabeth von Trapp lives up to the beautiful folksong performances of her ancestors, but she might perform a much better service to her audience by interpreting others' songs."
3,Completely over the top!,"Kathy Lette definitely has a style all her own. Full of puns, creative turns of phrase, and descriptions that would make Samantha Jones blush, Mad Cows is not for the weak at heart. The book begins with single mum, Maddy, who decides to brave her first shopping trip with her newborn. She ends up in jail, being harrassed by her solicitor, and ""sweet-talked"" by her fellow inmates. The story only gets more bizarre from there. This book is clearly meant to shock, so if you're looking for sympathetic characters and a heart-warming story, keep looking. If you're up for a psychotic ride and a unique novel, then this would make a quick and enjoyable read for you. This just isn't my particular style."
4,"Wonderful little, interactive book.","My son received this book for his 3rd birthday. I am now going to buy it for his friend's birthday. This book is a magnet for children. They love the fact that the book comes with little animal pieces that they can take out and play with and put into the book! The illustrations are adorable and the text is simple and educational (mostly about animal sounds). The only reason I didn't rate this book 5 stars is because the neat way the pieces are stored (behind a little sliding panel on the front cover--which is really cute and ingenious), has been torn a couple of times (I've had to glue and then tape the front cover). Little 2 and 3 year olds cannot easily get the pieces out on their own. With a little help and practice they can learn to, but until then the front cover can be quickly torn up."
5,Toward a new discipline of psychology: Hedonic psychology,"think subjective well-being is the most important problem of individuals and societies. Nowadays, people are more expressive for shaping their own life. Besides these improvement, cultures are interacting themselves and the definete features of some cultures become the common elements of whole societies. For example outonomy in individualistic societies is found as a important value of social life by collectivistic societies. Similarly the social support and relatedness in collectivistic societies are being given high priorities by individualistic societies. As a result found this book is very valuable for academicians and people."
1,Junk,"We bought this thermometer but when it arrived it didn't work. We figured that since the thermometer was so inexpensive, it would be cheaper to just replace the battery rather than pay to send the thing back. Well, even after the battery was replaced it only worked for about a month. I think we finally got disgusted and threw the thing away. A total waste of money!"
3,"Good, but not 10/20 seconds...","It starts beeping after about 20 seconds (under arm), but if you keep it there for another minute, the temperature reading goes up by another 0.7-0.8 degree, which is pretty significant. A very good product otherwise. Would be 5 stars if not for 20-second claim."
1,this is my first ever review,"i took 20 plus oral readings and not even once did the unit go over 96.7 degrees...took 15 on my wife, also low everytime 96-97 tops...i then went to my doctor to get their reading cause needless to say, i was worried. They assured me their unit is legit as two seperate readings garnered 98.5 and 98.6 and i then took this right out and got 96.5 right in front of the assistant! Now, for the first ever review, yes, this is a pretty little important unit everyone should have one they can rely on. Yes, we are talking $10 and we get what we pay for. Its when the ""return"" of the item that not available that annoys me to waste time writing about this piece of ...."
4,Excellent Robicheaux Mystery!!!!,"Dave Robicheauxis one Cajun who subscribes to the philosophy: ""hit first, before they hit you."" When Dave's old college roommate, Dixie Lee, comes into town, he asks Dave to look into the possibility that his coworkers may have killed two guys in Montana. Robicheaux gets pulled back to his old ways, and sure enough, he gets letters that threaten Alafair's life. So Dave beats the crap out of them, only to find out that he's now being charged with murdering one of them. He follows the clues to Montana, where he hopes to solve the crime before he goes to jail. There he gets involved with the mob, an illegal land scheme, two missing Native Americans, his old partner, Clete Purcel, and a beautiful Native American named Darlene. The plot is much better than the two previous novels. I enjoyed the ending and Burke's exceptional writing. This one deserved to win the Edgar Award!"
5,This is writing !,"I listened to the bookseller and was not deceived! I've just finished reading this book, and I find that we do have what they call a writer. At ease with both plot and surroundings,(cf the sceneries descriptions), J L Burke creates a daunting story, unconventional, and most of it, Robicheaux is quite in the domein of possible. I do not dismiss the nightmares parts, since we all experience fantasizing and daydreaming.As a teacher of English, I think lots of it -i.e. descriptions- would be allright to study."
4,Robicheauax travels west,"With 7 or 8 (New Orleans settings) JLB novels under my belt I feel that I can speak with some expertise.Burke has a very interesting lead with Dave Robicheauax. An on again-off again policeman who seems to have a very good sense of police work and bringing justice to the bad guys, he has a lot of help from his green eyed friend Cletus (most of his characters have green eyes !!) and with a touch of vodoo here and there. He really needs a glossary in the back to interpret the police/prison/cajun/black phrases and words he uses.His discriptions of the South Lousiana area are without equal. In this one he goes to Montana which is the setting for another series of his novels."
5,Burke Never Disappoints,"I read blurbs on books... They can be useful; some blurbs are from obscure publications; some are from authors who appear to be doing a favor to someone. But if I see a blurb from an author who rarely blurbs, and whom I respect, I will buy the book on that basis alone.Walker Percy gave this book a strong favorable review. I bought the book, the 1st Burke book I read, and have bought everything by Burke since.Burke's books address questions of morality, and how a moral person behaves in an immoral world. They are full of compassion and of passion. I cannot recommend him too highly."
3,Weak Dave Robicheaux story.,Plot was below par for Burke. Preferred Neon Rain and Morning for Flamingos in early entries to the Robicheaux series.
5,In the moment,"This is the 3rd book by Robert Burke that I have read. He has a talent for putting in the scene, watching Robicheaux go about his daily and nightly living. It is a well thought plot with believeable characters. I have made a point of visiting some of his locales (I know it is supposed to be fictious) but the ""feel"" is there.Good read."
5,A new fan.,My son gave me his newest book as a gift after a recent family trip to we took to New Orleans and that's how I discovered Burke and his characters. Now I've gone back to the beginning to enjoy the character development. His writing is so rich and descriptive.
3,James Lee Burke book rating,Usually James Lee Burke books are better written than this one was. It is an older novel so maybe he got better as he aged.
2,Got really boring,I liked the main character until I realized that I was almost half way through the book and hoping it was over. The writing style is interesting and the characters are good but the plot was boring. I didn't finish it.
1,Very Disappointing,"I was excited when I picked up this book because I had heard good things about Burke and the Robicheaux novels. Plus, this novel had won the Edgar Award a few years back, so I figured it had to be good. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Reading this book was one of the more excruciating experiences in recent memory. There is very little action in this book and very little suspense. The main character has got to be one of the more dull leads in modern crime fiction that I've read. For a good quarter of the novel, I swear he's just sitting on his porch, drinking iced tea feeling sorry for himslef, and the rest of the book he's driving around threatening people, telling them to leave him alone.Boring, bad, waste of time. This is my first Burke and Robicheaux novel and certainly the last."
5,Love it.....,This one might be one of my favorite Burke text's ever. I love his detective novels because his dialouge is so authentic to the Louisiana culture.
3,Vivid portrait of Montana,"Edgar Award 1990# 3 Dave RobincheauxI haven't read a lot of Burke and I think this was my first Robincheaux. Not sure that I am won over, not sure what all the fuss is about. No doubt I will read more but this was ok, nothing more.I seem to have a knack of picking the ones (""White Doves At The Morning"" & ""Cimarron Rose""), that aren't totally about Louisiana and the South and I think that is the ""sense of place"" that I am looking for.This one was partially set in Louisiana but much of the action also takes place in Montana - which is written with vivid description."
4,A jump in the country music.,This is one special collection for return on the 80's years.Optimal to listen in the car.
5,18 WHEELS OF STEEL PEDAL TO THE METAL,THIS GAME IS VERY LIFE-LIKE. CRUISING THE OPEN HIGHWAYS AND BACK ROADS. AVOIDING TRAFFIC. AVOIDING THE POLICE. AVOID CRASHING AND ROLLING YOUR TRUCK OVER. REAL LIFE RAIN. EVERYTHING A TRUCKER GOES THROUGH RIGHT ON YOUR HOME COMPUTER. MAKE YOUR DELIVERY TIME ON TIME AND GET CASH TO GET A NEW TRUCK OR FIX YOUR UP. MAKE ENOUGH MONEY AND RUN YOUR OWN FLEET OF TRUCKS. SIMPLY AWESOME GAME. THANK YOU FOR READING.
5,A master of the violin,"It seems incomprehensible that this recording has gone unnoticed for 4 years on Amazon. (No reviews?) Here is some of the most assuring violin playing you will hear. There is a delicate strength of phrasing and certainness of intonation as well asd confident energy that puts one at ease to simply let the music enter you. The playing is bold and embraces you and the musical composition is perfectly suited to the player. Not since Hilary Hahn's solo Bach debut has a violinist so impressed me. In Ysaye's violin sonatas we find the ghost of Bach's own partitas and sonatas roaming freely, especially given the shameless quotations from Bach himself. It's all very charming music. It would be nice to hear Ms Clamagirand's take on the Bach as well. And there are so many young violinists appearing these days. How does one choose? For $8.99 this download is worth every penny. The recording is beautiful and the accoustics perfect for such music. I await more recordings from this player."
1,Complete Disappointment,"I was SO excited when I found this realistic looking microwave that was supposed to have lights, sound and moving parts! Unfortunately when it arrived and was opened, absolutely none of these parts worked. For spending $35 on this toy, to say it's a disappointment is the understatement of the year."
4,Perfect for what we needed,"We bought a new (real) microwave for Xmas and suddenly our 4 year old was obsessed with it! So for his birthday (2 weeks later) we bought him this one and it's been a HUGE hit. It spins, lights up, makes noise - looks ver similar to our real microwave. The play food it comes with isn't the highest quality but it serves its purpose. So far so good!"
3,Not impressed,"When I saw this product I thought that it was cute and very realistic looking. I thought it would be a nice addition to my children's kitchen set. When it arrived, I was not impressed. The microwave appeared to be scratched and looked used. Plus it was not very durable looking. I sent it back."
1,This sucks,I ordered multicolored twist in hair jewels and ended up with clear jewels with velcro backing. I will not be ordering from this company again. There should be a better description of the products and they should send what is ordered not what they have.
4,Instrument carries ghost?,"This is an intricately twined, thoroughly engrossing story about cellist William Mellor who buys a second instrument that turns out to have an eerie voice and history. The actual events in the story are revealed subsequently through different character's perspective and actions. As a device, this is not totally effective, since often their voices become indistinct, if not indistinguishable. Still, there's lots of orchestra color, and mystery, and amorous intrigues abound."
1,Can It Get Any Worse?,"Robert Silverberg, Robert Reed, Nancy Kress, Alistair Reynolds, Charles Stross, and Greg Egan, edited by Garden Dozois should be an instant formula for greatness, but it isn't.None of the stories (novellas, really) in this collection is up to par for these authors. The concept - describe life in the year 1,000,000 AD - sounded intriguing.None of the stories are intriguing. They are boring and disappointing. I found myself skimming through whole paragraphs, trying to find something to justify the price of a hardcover. I failed to find it.With a reading speed approaching 2000 words per minute, I'd like the books I buy to give me some entertainment, if only for an hour. This one didn't."
3,"Disappointing, but then I'm not aboard the Jenkins bandwagon","I was surprised at how little narrative was in this book. I'm not a big Dan Jenkins fan but was expecting him to give us a fairly comprehensive history of SWC college football. Instead, we get a lot of press articles of the big games compiled at the time (by legendary sportswriters, admittedly, but written for a different purpose) intertwined with fictional conversations in a very non-PC bar (I don't find Jenkins' use of phrases like ""chinks"" and ""towel-heads"" to describe people who don't look like he does particularly endearing). There's not a lot of nostalgia, no real insight, and quite a lot of filler (the ten greatest games, who should have won the Heisman, etc.). And the book itself isn't very long.For me, the only thing which redeems the book are the photographs, most of which I'd never seen before. I think I'll give Jenkins' next book (whatever it is) a miss."
2,Not very comfortable,"The only reason this product gets a poor review is due to the massage feature. The memory foam is great and contours to my back. However, the massage feature is built into a plastic box within the memory foam. If you apply to much pressure, you feel the platic pressing against your back. I used it about five minutes in the car before I couldn't take it any longer. The batteries and plastic kept pressing into my back. I'm 6 feet tall and about 160 lbs, so I think anyone with a large to medium build would probably agree that the massage feature does more harm than good. As an alternative, I would recommend a lumbar support without the electronic massage feature."
3,Lumbar Cushion,This cushion was better for us then the last one we tried but still to soft and a little small.
3,It could be better,"This lumbar support is not wide enough for its purpose. It's too bad, for just another 3 to 4 inches on its width would make it just perfect."
1,I don't like it.,"I'm sorry, but I hoped for something to support my back and this little (and I do mean little) pillow squishes almost completely flat when I lean back against it. How is that good for support? I might as well have nothing there at all. I need as much firm support as possible, and this just isn't it."
5,Well worth the wait!,Seems like it has been a lifetime looking for a non-electric wok; and this one is just what we have been waiting for! Cooks everything evenly. It's big enough to make stir-fry for an entire family or just two. Wonderful Wok!
5,Anolon Advanced Wok,"I love using this piece of cookware. Excellent quality for the price, as is anything from Anolon. Highly recommended to anyone who loves cooking with a Wok!"
5,High quality RC,"This is a very good entry level RC. The instructions can be a tad vague and require some mechanical intuition, but overall it's a good value for anyone who wants to tinker and learn. A pair of needle nose pliers, a small and extra small phillips screw driver, and a knife for trimming the tabs off plastic pieces are all the tools that are necessary (a lug wrench and cheap phillips are included). A basic 2-channel radio system, 6-cell battery, and charger are required to complete the build, but with a little deal shopping can be found fairly cheap. I would recommend visiting your local hobby shop for these parts as they often have used or new factory take-offs on the shelf that can be had at a good discount, keeping your entire investment at or under $200. The end result is a satisfyingly cool looking, fun to drive, scale monster truck that is rugged and performs well on hard surfaces."
4,These are great,"I use these to keep my thick hair up into a bun or twist. I like them even though I found them a bit pricey for only a container of 16 pins. The container they arrive in is nice and unique to keep track of them though. They arrived 'FedEx' in a 2'x2' box, which the husband and I thought hilarious but not very 'green' in the recycling sense. However, they were a new company with 'Amazon' when I purchased them and hopefully they don't ship them that way anymore."
1,futon mattress cover,"Over a month ago, I received the futon mattress cover from the company whose name on the return address was scratched over so that it could not be read. Maybe intentionally??? I returned it because it was the wrong color and have yet to receive the correct one. So it is my belief that that is not a reliable organization."
5,I forgot Neil Young had so many hits,This CD is full of Neil Young's oldies you remember and oldies you forgot. Great listening throughout. Be prepared for some full-length versions of some of the biggest hits.
4,Good start on His Career if you are new to his stuff,"Neil Young finally has released a Single Greatest Hits Disc which captures some of His Biggest Hits. He is a Solid Songwriter&Overall Artist.you get a good wide overview of His Career here on this collection.sometimes you can forget just how long He has been around because He just keeps on doing His thing&not to mentiob Crosby,stills,Nash&Young.but this is a Good Reminder of His solo Work that still holds up really well.""harvest Moon"" is cool."
3,"I gotta write it, sorry Neil...","O.k., I love Neil Young, but we already have a ""Greatest Hits,"" it was called Decade. O.k., I'm sure this sounds better than Decade, but if you just want an overview of ole Neil, get Decade, and maybe Rust Never Sleeps.I understand that Journey Through the Past will probably never see a release on CD. That's o.k., I suppose. But man, we gotta see Time Fades Away on CD sometime, it's a great CD. And what about the faded Archive series we were suppose to see, 15 years ago?Before he put out a best of, there are other things that should see the light of day first."
2,Sub-par recording,"The packaging states that it was recorded from the ""original master recording"". Sounds like it was recorded from vinyl on an old turntable."
3,Whats the real reason?,"Let me start off by saying I love neil young and all thesesongs. This would get 5 stars just for the songs, but thereason young released this cd is he's still stalling therelease of his archive box set. This has been going on for3 or 4 years. Meanwhile the fans get screwed. Maybe neilshould stop having petty disputes with the label and startthinking about his fans."
1,Damaged and unsealed,"I received the CD case damaged and unsealed it looked like it was re-rapped and shipped. The CD itself appeared new , but it was annoying to have to get a new case for a so-called new CD. I guess the price was to much to asked. Be leery when you consider this compilation."
1,"I agree with Janis, and also...","it's too bad that ""Diamond Girl"" and ""Alone Again, Naturally"" did not make it onto this album. Then, I would give it a 4 star rating. Really."
5,"It is not enough, but a good start for beginners","If you have never listened to old Neil, this is a good start. Of course there are quite a few titles missing (albums like Zuma and On the Beach are not represented here, so there are not jewels like ""Cortez the killer"" or ""On the beach""), but some of the best songs are there. Of course, every fan has some favourites, these are just the most popular songs. The question is: in the age of downloadable songs what is the use of a compilation that any NEil fan can make on his own? Clearly the only possible target for this record is people who never heard Neil Young's albums, and to them I say ""buy it""!"
1,Neil Young Greatest Hits,I hope its great as I will never know as I did not get the product after I bought it!!! So where is it? Neil Young Greatest Hits?
5,Husband loved it!,"My husband requested this CD for his birthday. It arrived on time and he listens to it constantly, a favorite. No problems at all, thanks."
4,A good start,"There is no way you can make a one CD greatest hits for Neil Young. Not even Decade, which is two CD, comes close. Two CD's doesn't even cover a quarter of the work he has done. You would have to have about 5-6 CD's to even come close to doing it justice (but leaving out anything from 'Landing on Water' would be a good thing).This CD though has a good set of songs and if you are new to Young's music then it's a good start. I would also recommend 'Decade' but it's a bit dated and it really needs to be remastered for better quality. I would either start with those albums or just go buy 'Harvest' and 'After the Gold Rush.' Those were my first two Neil Young albums and I was not disappointed at all."
4,Possible Rationale,"This is mainly in response to the last few reviews who have questioned why someone with a history of keeping his fans on their collective toes would ""stoop"" to commercialism and release a greatest hits package. Lionel Trains, which Young owns something like 20 percent of, just filed for bankruptcy, so I've got a hunch this release might be a little more than coincidence. Upon learning this, all I can do is laugh and let any bitterness slide...Neil wins this round folks. So in the end, maybe this saves a pioneer in toy trains and introduces a whole new round of listeners to the genius of Neil Young."
3,Where's the second disc?,"I agree with Evil Lincoln that someone as prolific as Neil Young deserves a 2-CD greatest hits compilation. The total absence of Buffalo Springfield hits is a glaring omission, as well as the title track from ""Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere."" The liner notes state that his ""greatest hits"" are defined by record sales, airplay, and download history. Perhaps the problem is copyright ownership...I don't know. There certainly are other CSN&Y hits, as well, that deserve inclusion with Young's greatest hits. From a sonic standpoint, I also found that the first 3 tracks on this CD from the ""Everybody Knows..."" album could have been remastered better. There's obnoxious tape hiss that could have been eliminated. I have the ""Everybody Knows..."" CD, and there's no tape hiss on it."
4,Greatest Hits,"Greatest Hits being Young's 3rd compilation and is an album ""based on original record sales, airplay and download history"". The album was met with great reviews by the critics and was given a full score by Allmusic. It also did well with the public peaking at #27 on the Billboard 200. We get a list of whom plays what for each track. We also get a nice mini poster of Neil Young looking pensive with his guitar. 4/5."
4,Excellent Restrospective of a Great Career,"Actually, I'd give this CD four and a half stars. The only thing that prevents a five-star review is that any greatest hits of someone as important as Neil Young needs to have 2 CDs to cover all the material the man has produced over the years. Sound quality excellent, and the versions are full-length, as much as ten minutes in the case of 'Cowgirl in the Sand'. Neil Young was one of the seminal singer/songwriters of the sixties and early seventies, and his works capture the era of protest and baby-boomers coming of age. The song selection is good for a single CD. As someone who has most of Young's work on vinyl, I realize that this retrospective is only about half what deserves to be included, but it is a good start, and highly recommended."
4,Old genius,"Welcome to this production. It is great! What I really like about this stuff, is the best of 2 worlds. Good music and good musicians. Today a lot of music is computerized. It does not match the way that Young and others play the quitar. You can listen to every tiltle and enjoy. It is worth it to purchase this cd, plus you get his best works all in one!1"
3,Wasted space !!!,"Why waste 2-3 spots in the track listing with the terrible "" COWGIRL IN THE SAND"". Important songs such as "" SO TELL ME WHY and SUGAR MOUNTAIN"", would have filled this space perfect. Who wants BACK TO BACK ""long"", strung out songs on a CD. They are both terrible and the first 2 on the album. Also, ""HEYHEY -MY MY"" song.... just plain sounds old,bad and really stupid. THAT AINT NO HIT. I don't care what anybody say's.......as well as COWGIRL IN THE SAND. Plain terrible. What a waste of space for some good shorter, better played , wrote songs."
2,Been there - done that,"Agree with others who've said, Neil is the best, this is amazing stuff, but it's mostly on Decade. Why bother releasing this material yet again? Common Shakey...."
3,Some good old tunes,"Neil Young has song writing ability. No question. But to say his voice sounds pleasant is a bit of a stretch. Just kidding, Neil! Who am I to talk? At least Neil did it without the aides that many of today's artists use. You know who you are!I'm sure I'm not his biggest fan, but the songs from the CD, excuse me, HDCD that I've heard played on the radio are top-notch. My favorites: Cinnamon Girl, Rockin in the Free World, Ohio, and Heart of Gold.There is one problem with the disc, though. This disc is an unfortunate victim of the loudness wars. Kind of surprising really. But, there you go."
3,Enthusiasts Find,"You buy this book for the ""box of cards,"" money basket, and a banded box model. The box of cards model uses playing cards, money basket uses paper money for dollar bill fans, and the banded boxes is a more traditional fold with depth. There are some great photos of finished models, too."
2,A lot of S. Hawkings a few of the theory and almost nothing of everything,"If you want to know about the theory of everything you'd better watch theNOVA - The Elegant Universe(2003), because from this DVD you'll know a lot about S. Hawking and his antique voice reproductive software, but nothing new about everything."
3,Informative,"Too concise, but otherwise informative and entertaining. Loved the direct explanation of black holes and the clear focus of Mr. Hawking. Way to use brain power heroically!"
5,A Good Read,"Mended Hearts is well written; it is such a compelling story. Alex and Bryn are characters who have come to life, thanks to Ms Stokes. Grab a cup of hot chocolate and a quilt; curl up on the sofa in front of a fireplace and be prepared to be charmed."
1,Boring,Repetative and juvenile are the first 2 words which come to mind. This book is DULL. I never write reviews but this book was so disappointing I had to.
2,Let's discuss adjectives..........,"After reading some of the reviews, I figure I'm the rare bird that did not care all that much about this book. There was the beautiful doctor and the beautiful nurse, and the beautiful father and beautiful mother of the beautiful doctor. And, the kinda beautiful mother and kinda beautiful father of the beautiful nurse. Oh yeah, the beautiful doctor also had a beautiful brother, a beautiful house, a beautiful view, beautiful clothes and a beautiful car. Let's not forget the beautiful doctor's beautiful teddy bear, and the beautiful nurse's beautiful stuffed dog with the beautiful ribbon. And guess what...the beautiful doctor and the beautiful nurse just happened to resemble warrior princess and sidekick. I loved Xena and Gabby too, but am tired of every two main characters in every romance I've read lately looking like them. How about ""Lucy and Ethel"" lookalikes in the next book."
1,Not Worth It!,"It took 4 days to read a book that sould have taken one. The same thing over and over and over. After each lengthy break, I kept reading hoping that there would be something to justify all the paper invested to print it. Same theme ad nauseam. Beautiful, beautiful, love, love, love, cry, cry, cry. Not worth the effort or the money."
1,Poor Quality,"This headset only worked for 1 year. After one year, it started breaking down. First, the ear-hook was broken because of the weak plastic material. Then it has the charging issue. No matter how long I charged it, LED light was RED and flashing.Just called SONY customer service but they cannot help me at all since the waranty is only good for 1 year.Here's my conclusion --- why I spent more money on SONY's product if it only works for 1 year.I should buy a ""workable and cheaper"" headset from the other providers in the future, even it only works for 1 year. At least I won't have a bad feeling when I need to replace it."
3,"Works well, but...","...it is VERY uncomfortable after only a few minutes. It does come with a lanyard to hang it around your neck when you are not using it. I like that because I am a little suspicious of Bluetooth as well as the effects of other radiation over the long term. You can get the earpiece away from you head when not in use. I might have tired something else, though, with how this feels on the ear."
2,For Samsung this SUCKS!!!!!!!!! (Dont buy!),"I have the Samsung sgh-t809 phone and when the Ericsson hbh-610a can in the mail I was happy. After the first time I tried the headset I started to get a loud kracing noise in the backround . I called samsung and they were no help so then I called Sony ericsson and said (sometimes Sony ericsson hedsets might not be compatible with other brands of phone). But the problem is that it did say that it would work with other brands of phones.Pros: Looks cool, long battery life,Cons: Might only work with there own brand, Uncomfortable, Donsent fit wellon ear"
5,Sony Ericsson HBH-610,"I happend to own several different Bluetooth units (Motorola, Jabra250, Logitech freedom and Cardo Scala500) I have purhcased this bluetooth device somewhere else (cheaper) and all i can say is that this is the best I have ever tested. 61/2 hours of talk time, 300 hours of standby, clarity of calls is great, never dropped connections ( lot of them actually do it while talking, which very annoying),no static. So Far motorolas units are worst, Logitech is good but bulky/heavy and don't fit too good. Scala500 ( I have 2 of them in different colors)are also good I would rate them after Sony Ericsson. I would definitelly recommend this unit to everybody. Looks great too.It was definitelly worth of buing it and I'll keep using it for a long time. I use it with Samsung D600 and Samsung D500 phones."
4,Great quality,"I just recently bought this headset and it works great. I have pretty small ears and I find that it fits perfectly. It's very light weight and comfortable to wear on the ear for a long period of time. I've forgotten I was wearing it a couple of times now. I didn't notice any echoeing, and the range is good too. 20 meters. Friends didn't even realize I was on a headset. It's a great buy!"
2,Sony Ericsson HBH-610a Bluetooth Headset,"The headset connects well to bluetooth phones. Sound is very good, with occasional static. Working range allows movement away from phone farther than advertised. Battery life is excellent. Only came with one earpiece, which will not allow it to fit as comfortably as it could for some users. For me, after extended wear it becomes uncomfortable. Manufacturer should provide several options for different size earpieces since no two human ears are the same. Directions were not very helpful. Price was pretty reasonable."
2,"Poor sound, does not fit","Incoming sound was metallic/electronic sounding, though outbound sound was good. I have no idea whose ear this thing is supposed to fit - it did not fit either my ear or my wife's ear at all, so back it goes to Amazon."
3,not compatible with HP iPaq 6515 Pocket PC phone,"Nice fit, but not compatible with HP iPaq 6515 Pocket PC phone. Apparently, the iPaq doesn't have a headset profile that is compatible with this headset. Also, it uses a proprietary connector for the charging adapter, which means you'll have fun trying to buy an automobile adapter for it in an emergency travel situation. Gave mine as a gift to someone planning on buying a more up-to-date phone with the proper headset profile. And I thought bluetooth headsets would be backwards-compatible... I wound up having to buy a Plantronics headset, which had no problem connecting to my iPaq."
2,Stylish but bad sound quality.,"I bought this item because it looked stylish and was supposed to work decently as well. Well, in reallity it appeared that it does look good but the sound quality really dissapointed me, you can hear your peer's voice ok but the other party has trouble hearing well, the sound is transmitted broken up even when the distance between the headset and the phone is only 3 feet."
4,It's perfect!!!,This product is really gr8!I recommend it to anybody who wants to have quality when is talking on the phone. It works perfectly with my cellular and well as the skype. I can listening to the other person cleary and without any delay. Besides that you can also listen to your mp3 if you want.you won't regret!
3,Mediocre,"This headset would be fine if you're inside all the time, but it picks up ambient noise too well. Another thing is that the earpiece didn't fit anywhere close to my ear canal, and there is no way to adjust it. I sent it back right away and bought the 645 model, which has been much, much better."
4,Nice product,"fits snuggly to your ear and can work nicely on either ear, volume is great also. tends to hurt when worn for extended periods."
4,"long bat life, but a bit heavy","This is a great Bluetooth head set. It has a long standby and talk battery life, longer than the old Plantronic head set I had. I particularly like the mute feature for those long conference calls while I am on the road.The one draw back is it is heavier than other Bluetooth headsets that I have tried in the past. This makes it harder to have on your ear for long periods. The plus side is you will no ""forget"" its on your ear and take if off so you don't look like a geek in public places."
4,Pretty Good,"Excellent device, works really well with my sony erricson Z520a. Noise cancelling and good reception"
3,Not for beginners,This is certainly not for beginners. It moves too fast to actually show the steps invovled.
1,not for beginners,"this dvd is too advanced for beginners, i have a lot of other cardio dvd's i use and thought i'd try this one out but it just sits around collecting dust. I have even loaned it out to friends, it is to fast paced to keep up with. she moves to fast and then coreograghs it all together so quickly, before youv'e even learned the moves. I wouldn't reccomend for beginners."
1,not for me,"not really for beginners. some moves and exercises are more for dancers than someone like me that wants a low key, easy to follow exercise routine (Leslie Sasson type). this isn't it."
2,Too few repetitions of each routine,"Although the instructor is very enthusiastic and energetic, the program is not easy to follow. The routines are changed too fast, with not enough repetitions. It is not fun and safe to change from one routine to another so fast. I tried to do the program once, slightly hurt my back, and changed to another instructor afterwards. Definitely not for beginners."
2,found it difficult to follow,"I have been using walk at home DVD's since the summer. I decided to get this DVD along with a few others for a variety to my workouts. I found once she started, that even though the moves were easy, there were very few reps of each move. She jumped from move to move so quickly I couldn't keep up or remember which moves I had just done to repeat them once they were connected."
1,NOT for beginners,I agree with other 1 star reviews..this DVD is not for beginners...or for anyone other than the instructor and her team for that matter. I have tons of cardio DVDs and I consider myself at intermediate to advance level. The routines are too fast paced and it looks like you will need to watch it over and over and over just to get the moves right ! A cardio DVD should burn a lot of calories..but MUST be simple to follow - which this isnt. This applies to both the Athletic and Dance routines. It was a waste of money and time for me.
1,Will not try the vendor again,"vendor sent me the wrong dvd, wouldn't communicate with me and the dvd I received was not worth the trouble. The workout host misses her count, doesn't give appropriate cues and forgets her topic."
4,on demand is great.,"I love this instructor. Been a great fan for many years. Now with instant on demand,no wait period for arrival for DVD. Purchase her workouts, you will not go wrong.Thanks Amazon."
4,Great for people who like aerobics and those who want to start exercising,"I really love petra's down to earth attitude and i love her energy. BUT...if you're a beginner and have no aerobics experience you have to pay close attention to keep up with memorizing choreography. Don't worry its not too complicated. I consider myself a beginner. I don't usually work out. But the workouts weren't so hard to do. I found myself struggling near the end to not give up. But that's because i don't usually work out.The plus side, is that Petra does a great job at explaining things and not making you feel stupid. I totally recommend this video if you don't normally exercise but want to start somewhere. This is a great addition to a beginners collection."
4,Great workout,"I have several of Petra's videos some are so old they are on VHS! She consistently has great workouts. This one is very good, it is for beginners but you still get a pretty good workout. I do use this dvd on days when I want to take it a little easy. She has great cueing so you are never lost. Some of her moves are repeats from older videos but I guess when you have been doing this for about 20 years that will happen."
2,Changes Moves WAY Too Fast,"I haven't done an exercise video in years and years and thought it would be good to start with something ""for beginners."" This definitely is not. Petra is very likable, and I like that it gives the option to choose blocks of different lengths of time to start at just 10 minutes and build up and/or build your own work-out by combining blocks, but that's as much as I can say for this. Instead of just doing a shorter routine to fit into 10 minutes, she does fewer repetitions of each exercise. The result is that it goes really fast and by the time you figure out the move she's doing and start to catch up, she's doing something else! It's a disaster trying to do this video as an actual beginner! If she wants it to be for beginners, she needs to slow down and do more repetitions so that the beginners can figure out what's going on. This is for more experienced users who are already familiar with the moves and just don't have time to do more than 10-20 minutes at a time."
1,"Overpriced, and Extremely Confusing","LATIN ROAD TO ENGLISH GRAMMAR is a horrible program. First the materials are of cheap quality as if they were handmade on a computer, and way overpriced. It is dull and extremely boring. Do not waste your money on the DVD's as they offer absolutely no help whatsoever. On the DVD everything is very long and drawn out it seems to go on and on; then the woman constantly talks in circles, and goes on and on constantly making references to her other programs. The English Grammer that is present is not very through. My kids were totally turned off by this program. The answers are not very easily found to the assignments. I would recommend buying another program instead. There are several other programs that are easier to use such as the ones offered by Memoria Press,Latin For Children, Lively Latin, and Logos School. Save your money on this, not worth it at all."
4,"Includes Jorge Ben, Airto, Dom Salvador, Trio Mocoto, Joao Donato, Milton Banana and others","This is a one-CD set of mostly wonderful samba and bossa-style Brazilian music with some more updated tracks, which are also quite enjoyable."
1,"Still very basic, very expensive, very bad customer service.","You think it's a pretty good offer they make. A 6 months money back guarantee!But beware, if you actually want a refund after you sent it back, you just don't get it. The support does not answer and they don't issue a refund. I am waiting for mine for 3 months now. I don't think I will get it.Don't buy it."
2,"Recycled material (well ok, this was the original); mediocre for the layman","If you are a therapist looking for a book on RET, this may be useful. However as a common person just looking for some good advice, I found this book to be lacking in readability. It provides some interesting example dialogues, but I find it VERY hard to believe that any counselor would actually make the judgmental statements attributed to the hypothetical therapist in the book. Also, I felt like there was way too much repeat information from ""How to Refuse to Make Yourself Miserable about Anything: Yes Anything!"" which isn't too surprising as it is also written by Ellis. I'd recommend the later book as it is organized in a better manner and has generally been cleansed of the hard-to-understand jargon."
3,Catholic 101,The Bible is real. Catholic was sometimes porrayed as unbiblical. They cannot read anything but officially approved translations of the Bible. The Catholic church produced the Bible. The Bible is the word of God. The Pope is the head of the church. The church's only purpose is to praise God. The Mass was the official worship of the church. Sometimes it was in English or Latin.
4,Excellent for the fans,I found this second Armitage film to be a wonderful continuation of the first Poly-Matrix.Wish the voices had stayed the same...but very rarely does that happen...and Juliette Lewis did a very good job still.I really enjoy the way this film shows how having a child and hiding from the government has affected their family. So when someone takes out a plant manufacturing IIIrds Armitage must investigate.Fascinating display of emotions and growing closer to her husband and daughter...I thought this film deserves two thumbs up overall.The story line was a little weak...but no more so than most sequels. I enjoyed the actions...and Armitage's evil counterparts were SUPER!Ending was superb in my opinion and I can't wait to purchase my own copy (Saw this one with a friend).Overall I would give it five stars....but it lacks that little something...so i'm rating it a wonderful four stars.ENJOY!
4,armitage dual matrix (special edition),"i liked armitage dual matrix, they should of kept the sameactors.also the hair style of armitage should have stayed the samebut over all i say 4 stars."
4,"Not Bad, but not as good as the original.","Let's face it, the story, animation and character development was better in the first Armitage film. BUT, this film is a decent sequel. On a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being anything related to Pokepuke, I give this film a 6.5."
4,Stay around for Dual-Matrix!,"This set packs both movies together which is the best way to go in my opinion. The first movie Poly-Matrix is nothing to get too excited about, it's not great only good. It lacks the amount storytelling and fight scene quality that the sequel has but still proves to be entertaining.Dual-Matrix is where it's at, the stories stronger in this installment(though i won't give any spoilers). The fight scenes rock so hard you have to see it for yourself. So buy this set because Dual-Matrix is a must have and you wouldn't want to watch before its predecessor Poly-Matrix even if it isn't as good as Dual-Matrix. A deal no anime fan should miss."
2,Painful to watch,"Basically, it was a good idea. Good story line, great character art, but the entire movie is done in a CG system. Which actually isn't the problem. Series like Love Hina are also done entirely in CG. The problem is this is first generation stuff. Instead of having the smooth flow that new Anime series have, it looks like ""Space Ghost Coast to Cost"" quality animation. It just ends up looking very unnatural. It's hard to watch because the character art is so good, but the final product is so lacking, and disapointing to watch."
1,[sorry] sequel,"I really enjoyed the first Armitage series, then turned to a movie. There was actual character and story development, great animation, terrific concepts overall of robot/human relations, etc. The sequel however, was a [sorry] rehash; using the basic premise of the societal problems in the first film, it portrays naomi as more of just a robot rather than the thinking feeling third that she is, and Ross as the hapless tag along... Poor computer graphics, repeated images, and panning across still landscapes fill this anime, giving it about 12 minutes of actual animation and 0 originality."
1,This Sequel Shames It's Predecessor,"It was a Herculean labor just to get through this .... Not only were the characters watered down, dull, and one-dimensional (in fact, they're mere shadows of the characters they were in Poly-Matrix), but the plot was dull and uninsprired, and the thing was so full of badly done and even more badly integrated CGI that I had to cover my face in disgust every time it came on. The English dubbing was so awful I had to change it to the Japanese just so I could stand it. Just buy Poly-Matrix and pretend that they never made this disappointing sequel."
4,"Decent action, Better story.","Standard man creates monster scenario.Humans create robot sophisticaed enough to pass off as human, the most advanced ones can conceive a child with the help of a human male. Much like in the animatrix, things escalate to the point were we must question if these robots are just tools, or individuals with minds of their own and our resposibility to them.Cover ups, sabotage, banishment & discrimination, and love. Love being the strongest point of these stories. Both self preservation and mutual love.The action is decent, the story line-I believe to be fairly solid and understandable. I tell you about the story because I believe that adds most of the intensity to this movie. I'd say maybe 1/7 to 1/5 of these movies are action sequences, and their done quite well, but that wasn't the selling point for me."
3,Could be better.,"As with the OVAs, I feel that there is not a whole lot to this anime. I feel that is could have been much better with more antagonists to be delt with and the ones already there not so easily delt with. I still think that some people could enjoy it thus the three-star rating."
2,Not Energizer as advertised,"Energizer ECR2430BP Lithium 3-Volt Coin Cell BatteryThis product as sold by 'National Deals', is advertised as ""Energizer ECR2430BP Lithium 3-Volt Coin Cell Battery"" but the battery that arrived is not Energizer brand. The battery I received is ""GP"" brand, if you've ever heard of that. Still, I put it in my device and it worked, so I'm giving it 2 stars instead of one."
4,Hard-to-Find,"I needed this battery for my alarm clock and discovered that it is not available in my grocery store nor in my drugstores, so I was glad to find it on Amazon at a reasonable price."
2,I couldn't finish this one.,"I love both history and war books. In the few chapters that I read, this one seemed sufficiently researched. However, when the author continuously started describing first person accounts of the anxiety and emotion of sitting in a cockpit, weathering a depth charge attack in a submarine, or heading into battle without crediting the source specifically the person who was actually in those shoes, it was more poetic license than I could take. If I wanted to read good fiction, I would have picked up a Farley Mowat book."
5,Excellent condition,"The book arrived in great shape in just a few days, which is amazing for a shipment to Hawaii."
2,Too Bell heavy,"Holds well with minimal scratches, but with the flip folder attached it makes it really bell heavy to the point i don't want to use it."
4,Lyre,I bought this for my daughter to use at band camp and marching. It seems to do the trick...she needed a lyre to put on her cellophone.
2,Expected better quality,"Obviously, I purchased this item as it represents my Alma Mater. It arrived and instead of a sturdy polished piece of jewelry, it was very thin and the back of the charm was rough and unfinished. I would have gladly paid more for a better designed charm that I could wear proudly. I will mention this to the Wellesley Alumnae Association to address the product. Also, I specifically informed the vendor that I will be wearing it as a charm and instead of a necklace attachment(bale), I required a lobster clasp. They agreed and sent it as a pendant regardless of my request.It would probably be simpler if I took it to a jeweler and have it modified for the intended use. The designer is peddling poorly crafted products and the vendor should make sure that each order is delivered as ordered."
4,Adaline Falling Star,This story follows the spunky Adaline and gives a variety of glimpses into the time period. She is a likable and funny character who I found myself really rooting for- and wondering more and more about her famous father and what he was doing the whole time! The flashbacks and mystical themes enrich the storyline. A great female protaganist and her wonderfully intelligent dog companion make for a thoroughly entertaining and inspiring book.
4,Adaline Falling Star,"Another wonderful book from Ms. Osborne. The research behind it shines through without overshadowing the story. I was a bit disturbed by the ""cutting"" incidents but mention of the cultural context helped put it into perspective. The feelings of grief, rejection, and abandonment Adeline experienced will provide interesting discussion if the book is read with students in the classroom."
4,A Newbery Reader,"I enjoyed reading Adaline Falling star. I thought it was an interesting, easy to read book. I liked how Adaline's religion was a mix of the Great Spirit and the Holy Spirit. Falling Star is a very determined girl who wants to find her father. I thought it was at times an amusing story especially when Adaline was with Dog.It truly was a good book!"
3,Adeline Falling Star,"After the death of her mother, Adaline is sent to St. Louis by her father to live with her cousins so he can explore the West. Adaline is a wild and adventurous girl and she does not like living with her ""civilized"" cousins. She is treated so harshly that she runs away and tries to find her way back to where her mother's people live. During her journey, Adeline meets a lovable homeless dog and she and the little dog face many obstacles and challenges that they must overcome. Adaline Falling Star was written by Mary Pope Osborne. The author portrays the characters very well. By the end of the book they feel as if they are real. Although it was very descriptive, Adaline Falling Star was slightly boring at times. It is a good book but would not be described as a page-turner. Somebody who likes reading realistic fiction might enjoy this book."
1,Dissatisfied with Seller,I had purchased this item as a gift for my brother and it wasn't the book he was looking for. I emailed to the buyer through Amazon to see if I could return the book to get the correct one I received no response!!!! For someone not to respond to the buyer is not good business in my book. I will not buy from this person again!!!!
4,Pretty Good,I have to agree with Mark a little. I am conflicted. Michael shows real promise. Some of the songs I loved the first time I listened to them (like 'On The Third Day' and 'God Is With Us'. Others took listening to a dozen times but then I liked them a lot. But many of the songs didn't do anything for me at all. I think the album is worth buying just for the few really good songs it does have. But I wish it had more of them.I think of Michael Olsen as a mix between Chris Tomlin and Matthew West. He can write some very nice upbeat stuff like Matthew west. But most of the music on this album is more mellow like Chris Tomlin.
5,A highly recommended Anime!,"As one of the fans of Anime and Manga, His and Her Circumstances is really a must! Funny and love stories are always put in every sections while we also find ""important meanings"" in the story. Beautiful and simple plot has been used with a perfect animation.....Finally, this DVD is highly recommended to have as a collection."
5,The Most Honest Romance in Anime,Absolutely brilliant! Anime unlike any other of its genre. Don't mistake His and Her Circumstances as romantic fluff because of its title or shoujo character-design. This series is thought provoking and more than a little disturbing in its truthful depiction of real life relationships. I would recommend this for any anime fan who enjoys insightful stories and well developed characters. The entire cast is great. This is Neon Genesis Evangelion stripped of sci-fi and brought down to Earth.
3,Flawed DVD of Great Series,"Having seen this series several years ago, I was looking forward to the DVDs from Rightstuf, however, the sheer number of technical problems I have had with the disc cause me to warn off others until Rightstuf acknowledges and fixes the problems.On many different players this disc freezes or the subtitles shut off, or don't display at all."
5,Great!,"This series is great! I've read the original comics as well, and although they're not exactly the same, the anime follows it closely. It's totally hilarious! The best thing about the anime is the way it expresses itself. It uses all these anti-traditional methods, like one episode had real taped backrounds- the characters were cut and pasted on to it! And every episode has different methods! Unlike most anime it doesn't give you all these blanks where nothing much happens- just to make the episode longer and in addition, the series as well; the story is fast moving and sometimes so fast you better pay attention or you'll miss a punchline! Sometimes it can get confusing because of the wierd ways it expresses the scenes, but you'll get used to it!"
3,This is made for guys not gals,I have to say basically all anime i mean like 95% are made by guys for guys. And this is no exception it plays into boy fantasies about being the object of affection of some cute girl. On that scale this series ranks somewhere among love hina and AMG on how obivious it tries to use this tool to sell the series to a predominately male audience.
1,awww,i like the story but the animation is a different story sometimes its ok but some times it s@cks i mean very annoying as manga its 5 star all the way as animation i hate it animation should at least be tolerable half of it is just scribbles it pi$$es me off if you dont have funding then dont make it at all as manga its awsome as anime its awful sorry guys its the truth.
3,Works.,"It's better than the bar, but it's still not that comfortable. I use a smaller bar from an older bench for squats, rows, etc. and it doesn't fit the bar tight. Looks like it would fit an Olympic bar fine, though."
4,Another Spanish Dessert Movie,"For madcap, over the top, campy, sexy hilarious comedies, currently no one beats the Spaniards. This is one of the best, with a sterling cast, a tight libretto and frenzied directing. Sit back and enjoy!"
2,It burns...,"Tingling? Not really. It burns more than tingles. You pay so much for shipping that you end up paying almost $14 for this item. You're better off going to a store with self-checkout if you aren't comfortable buying this stuff. The smell is okay, but I've smelled better minty stuff. It does taste kind of minty, but it has a slight bitter taste when it first touches your tongue. I just dabbed my finger in it to try it. It comes in a brown box from Amazon... and arrives within a week. Would I buy it again? No. Might just use it for a massage oil. Downside? Must be removed with soap and water."
1,Tingly?? maybe for massaging your feet...,"I had high hopes for this product, but it fails on many levels. Taste- make sure to shake it alot or you will burn your mouth off- way too artificial tasting. Consistency is ok at first, but once friction comes into play it turns tacky and gel-like. I ended up throwing this out. If you like flavored lube, go for the O'my products!"
4,WEST COAST JAZZ,"THIS IS AN OVERVIEW OF SHELLY'S RECORDING WORKS HE DID ON THE CONTEMPORARY LABEL OUT ON THE WEST COAST IN THE 50'S. HIS SIDEMEN INCLUDE ART PEPPER, RUSS FREEMAN, BUD SHANK, LEROY VINNEGAR, AND OTHER WEST COAST JAZZ MUSICIANS WHO POPULARIZED THIS KIND OF LAID BACK, COOL SOUNDING JAZZ. EXCELLENT CD."
4,Contains useful concise summaries of each major topic.,"Barron's AP Physics B Review is the only study aid I recommend to my Advanced Placement Physics students. It contains beautifully concise summaries of all the topics covered by the Physics B exam. For this reason it is useful to the student searching for a comprehensive, yet to the point, review of physics. I also recommend this book to beginning AP Physics teachers in search of quality exam questions. Unfortunately, because this book was published in 1995, many of the exam questions--especially the multiple choice--are not of the same format type as that of the current exam. Also, I wish more sample exam questions were included by Wolf. I am eagerly anticipating a new AP Physics B review to match the new exam format."
2,"Big Price, Small Bottle",For $14 I thought that this would be larger. It is literally no larger than my thumb! I get samples in the mail bigger than this. It was a lousy deal. But it still smells great. But I do prefer the newer Escada perfume. You should try it.
4,Mystery and Humor Combined,"This story is told from the perspective of ""Biggie's"" 12 year old grandson - and a unique perspective it is. Those who like a rural setting with rich and unique characters will enjoy this book. The mystery is interesting, but the humor and collection of characters is what makes this book worth the time to read."
1,Extremely Dissatisfied,"If you want to go back to the days of ironing your sheets and pillowcases then this is the set to buy. They look terrible and the pillowcases are not cut straight. The hem does not match by 3/4 of an inch on one side and one length is an inch longer than the other side. Since the stitching is not straight I had to try and iron it down after one wash to get it looking halfway decent. Also states will fit up to 18"" mattress but barely fits my 14"" mattress. For this amount of money I expected a quality product that would last for years. No more Vanessa Products ever!"
4,great blanket,"I really like this blanket, could be a little thicker, but very very soft and is just big enough for a throw..."
3,not that big,"I guess I should have checked the measurements. I bought this for my son (6'4"") - it is not near big enough. I did like the softness of the coverlet and the color (brick)."
4,Great Deal on a Great Throw!,"My son was asking for an extra blanket for his bed. He didn't need it all the time, just occasionally. Therefore I thought a throw would be great to put on as needed. This did the trick. And on sale it was quite the bargain."
4,Warm and Cozy,"While I had been looking for a throw with more down filling, this one is very soft and warm."
4,"Nice, warm blanket","I ordered two of the Pike Street Wraparound Comfort Throw in Camel, and they arrived yesterday. They're lightweight, yet surprisingly warm. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the stitching, especially since the prices of this throw are more than reasonable. Be warned, though, that the Camel is darker than shown in this picture. It's closer to beige than tan. I don't have a problem with the color being darker. The throws still match the espresso color of our couches. This was a good buy, and I already have three more on the way. They will make excellent Christmas gifts.UPDATE: I now have the Pike throw in Espresso and Brick, too. The colors are magnificent. Very rich and true to the pictures. This throw is such a good buy!"
2,Not a nice blanket.,"Quality of the material was very poor, very unpleasant to the touch. I ended up buying a plush blanket for a lower price."
1,Didn't fit description - not down,"I just received this blanket and was disappointed. I am not sure I even received the right one but it was not pink and brown, just brown and has 0% down inside, just a thin batting. I would not pay $20 for this synthetic thin blanket that provides no warmth. Disappointed and am returning it."
5,"Baby Soft, Excellent Quality and Value.","I purchased two of these throws as gifts and one for myself. Everyone in the house fights over mine, including my dog. It is so soft, I feel like I am under a baby blanket. What a great value for the money. I wish I had gotten two more of them and just might order more."
3,Ok for price,"Based on the color on my monitor and the name ""Brick,"" I expected an orange-red throw. It is more of a cranberry or burgundy actually, so does not match my living room. Based on the price, though, I will keep it for our basement rather than returning it. It is definitely lightweight. I haven't used it yet, so I can't comment on warmth. It is too short, also, being that my husband and I are both tall. No way you can have your mid/upper body and feet warm at the same time with this throw, if you are tall. Overall underwhelmed, but then again, it was super cheap."
4,Fantastic deal when on sale,"These throws/wraps are fantastic! The soft, sueded fabric is one side of the baffled shell that encases the perfect amount of down for a super light, yet cuddly throw. I wish I'd bought more when they were on sale! They're just the right size for a quick nap, or to curl up on the couch with while reading a good book. They're lighter than down blankets (also great things to buy) and look great thrown casually over the corner of a couch or chair. I bought two-one chocolate and one sage colored one and found that guests love them too. I'm hoping for a sale soon so I can stock the rest of my house."
4,Green Blanket,My granddaughter and her boyfriend said these were very warm. They use them all the time. And they love the colors. I highly recommend these to everyone.
2,No Down in this!,"Many of the reviews of this item speak of it as containing at least some down. It doesn't--100% polyester. Since I wanted down, I am returning it."
4,Better Than Expected,"I bought two of these when Amazon had them on sale. I cannot remember the exact price now, but I got a good deal. I thought for the price that they would not last very long, however, I have had them for a couple of years now, and they have held up well. My dog likes to take one of them in the colder months, so I have washed them repeatedly, and they still look good. A word of warning about these blankets, since they are microsuede they produce a lot of static. I wish this brand would make a cotton version, like the larger bed size down blankets, for that reason. Cotton would eliminate the static and would be better for year round use."
3,Super soft but a little small,"I paid $9.99 on a Black Friday lightening deal and am overall satisfied with the blanket. Like other reviewers, I did picture this being larger...at 5ft10inches, if I wrap it around my feet, it comes up to my midsection. But it's a fine size to keep on the couch for an attractive and very warm throw. The brick color in person is also nicer than the color in the picture - a little less orangish in reality. Happy with the deal I got, but at full price $20, I probably would look for something a little larger."
4,Wonderful cuddle value!,"I just purchased a chocolate throw, last year I bought a green one. They get softer over time! (More cuddly) The color of the chocolate is very accurate in pic. The green is a more muted color which blends well with a blue couch.Don't expect much thickness, but do expect to feel very soft down in this, which stays where it belongs. It is great for summer nights on the couch, a bit lightweight for winter. It's a bit longer than most throws, which is a +. It is the only down product I own. I am allergic to feathers, but this has never bothered me. I really like it and it makes a great gift!"
5,Good Throw,"These throws are great looking and the price is even better. I bought 2 for 10.99 each. They are warmer than they look, very comfortable. A little small but for the price they are great."
4,Soft and warm,"I agree that it is a bit small for a throw, but you can't complain when they clearly list the dimensions in the description. It is a great lap blanket though. Very lightweight and soft, but surprisingly warm."
4,"Warm, but just a little small","Great blanket, very warm and good looking. The only thing I would like is for it to be a bit longer."
3,A little disappointed,"I bought this blanket in two colors for my living room. I thought they would be a little thicker. They are not bad, but I was looking forward to soemthing a little more luxurious. I will say the material is very soft!"
4,Great value,"This blanket may not be very big, but for $15...it is a great blanket to watch TV under or is perfect kids size :)"
4,Nice and Soft,"I have been enjoying this throw for about a month now. The Espresso color is very nice and as others have said, it is nice and soft.I never saw the measurements given when I was placing my order, so I just took a gamble. For those of you who would like to know- The tag says it is 50""x60"". I just measured mine and it is 49""x58"".If it was a foot or two longer I'd have given it 5 stars."
5,Warm!,"My in-laws love how warm and comfy it is, and my wife loves that and the color (both this and the Brick). Very soft too. Not heavy and not large, but a nice size for sitting on a couch or chair. May (or may not) last, but at $10 it's a fantastic buy."
4,Warm but a little thin,"This was a great buy for $10-15. only complaint is that they are thinner than I wished, but if you pair this blanket up with a fleece blanket you will be plenty warm. I would compare this blanket to ones I found at Ikea for 40 dollars. I recommend this good deal here on Amazon.com."
3,"Looks Better Online, Not Same Item as Good Reviews","I bought this for a Christmas gift. It was not the color it showed online. The green looked more sage online but it's really a true olive. The fabrics feel cheap and one side is slippery, almost like a coat lining. It smelled weird when I took it out of the bag. Also, the size is not all that big. The wraparound description is if it's a child or small adult. If I'd had more time, I probably would have returned it, but I didn't have the time to change it out. Good thing I bought it on sale so I didn't feel so bad. I didn't even notice feathers in the piece. It felt more like a big hunk of polyester. Disappointed when I saw that one the description. I should have read reviews more carefully then I would have noticed that Amazon changed the product. I didn't notice the reviews until after I'd opened the item."
2,Not Happy,"I purchased four to give as gifts. When i recieved them, they were almost 12 inches smaller than the then the two i bought last year."
4,This is a perfectly adequate throw.,"I love this throw. I have not tried to wash it, so I can't address other reviewers issues there. But this is a fine throw for when you are being a couch potato and don't want to turn up the heat. It is soft and a great size that covers me from neck to toes. For the price I paid ($10.99) it is great."
4,"Quite pleased, would purchase again...","I read all the great reviews and bought 3 of these blankets! But the specs do say that it is 50x70...I am only 5ft so I thought it would cover me head to toe, but it did not. So 50x60 sounds more accurate. I was a bit disappointed by this. Also the green throw does not look like it appears on the web. The color is quite off. The others seem right on point however.This is the softest, warmest, lightest, fluffiest blanket ever! I really do like them. So much in fact that I wound up opening the one I had planned on using for a gift. (But like I said the color was off anyway. I bought it for a gift for a friend having a baby. But the green was not the light sage color I expected... more of a dark olive.) I have one wrapped around me now while I type my review. They are really warm. One caveat, the air must be dry in our house because these blankets give off static cling sparks! Turn off the lights and it will really be a show!Next purchase, a humidifier..."
1,Did I get the wrong throw?,I was really looking forward to getting this after the great reviews. Did I get a defective one? This is completely flat and thin and not warm at all. One look at the label tells you that this is 80% polyester and only 20% down feathers. So it is a flat polyester-filled throw without much polyester.
2,Throw-away,"I ordered a few of these throws and liked them at first. They were a nice size and weight - not too bulky. The quality seemed to be decent for the (reduced) price, with just a few trailing threads. The reversible surfaces, suede-like and microfiber added a nice visual touch.They're machine washable, but after a few washes they started shedding feathers all over the place, and sadly they had to go. I was washing them every couple of weeks. If you wash them less frequently they might be more durable.Definitely not worth it at full price. And not worth it for me at the reduced price. It's a shame, because I had hopes."
1,misleading description - too small,The product description says this throw is 50inch by 70inch and will cover you from head to toe.It seems from some of the good reviews that this refers to another product of similar design.THIS throw is much smaller and will NOT cover even your legs properly if you are an slighty taller than average or more adult. Maybe not even for an average adult. Certainly not head to toe unless you are very short in stature or a kid.
4,Comfy but small,"If you're a small person this is perfect for you. If you fall asleep with it you'll spend the entire night trying to fit under. The throw is fantastic, feels great, and it's my fault I got 60"" worth of it, but the word throw... threw me off. :-)"
1,Sharp Feathers poke through fabric...,"Wow. Worst purchase from Amazon ever. This thing is so bad I actually sent it back on principle. I have no idea what all those people who gave it a good review are smoking, but I'm pissed I listened to them on this one. :)Very poor quality. Flat lifeless. The stuffing shifts from one end to the other as the baffles aren't sealed. The thing is almost all feathers with sharp points that work their way through the fabric and poke into your skin and then end up all over your clothes and the floor. Save yourself the trouble of throwing something away that you paid good money for. This item is bottom of the line cheap. Nothing even remotely quality about it."
2,"NOT Warm, NOT Big",The price absolutely reflects on the product. Too small to warm you up. Garbage. RETURNED!
2,Big Island Audio Tour,After using the Road to Hana audio tour we were expecting this to be the same. It wasn't. It had very little to say about the spots noted -- would not recommend it to anyone
3,The Road Too Often Traveled,"I really wanted this to be a 5-star book. It's not. It's a wonderful concept, but too many of the stories have too many shared elements. Because of that, they don't shine in the way stories in an collection must.I hope the publisher will continue its commitment to publishing women's travel stories, but with a different mix of writers and adventures."
4,a great read and a good gift for anyone who travels or wishes they could,Give it to your friends as it takes you away on so many different travels.
5,Rigid pipe cutter cutting wheel,Bought this for an old battered Rigid #15 pipe cutter. I had to spread the cutter slightly to get the wheel in.Works fine.
5,Great Show when will season 2 start or is it in production?,"I love the show I think it sets a postive example for our american and african young woman and Jill Scott and Ani Noki Rose gives a great performance on every show. My question is when will season 2 start or is it alrady in production? I know Jill had her son and mabey she taking some time off, and also she does her music thing great also. But seeing her beautiful face on tv is a bonus so I was just wondering what qtr of the year will season 2 arrive."
5,Loving No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency,What a wonderful family oriented series. I am hoping the producers decide to film a Season 2. This is feel good TV at its best. I want more. Jill Scott and the cast are wonderful.
5,I wish there were more!,"The stories were beautifully rendered.And, until I looked up the principal actors, I thought they were all Africans.Nope. Americans with excellent dialect and movement coaches.You really DO want to watch the additional material about the making of these episodes and meet the people behind this film.I have read (actually listened) the (audio) books. Which, in the case of these stories is even better than reading them. (Lisette Lecat, the reader, does a wonderful job with the Botsawanan words. Lovely to hear. http://www.amazon.com/The-No-Ladies-Detective-Agency/dp/1402545355/mywishlistA )I absolutely loved these videos.Stories with gentleness, forgiving and understanding - along with a bit of mystery, daring, boldness and determination.This is the only season. There may be no others.Two of the principals who produced it both died - within a few months of each other (one young, one old). How odd.I dearly hope someone picks this project up and continues - with the same actors."
5,Delightfully different,"I purchased these for my mother for Christmas after she told me about reading the books. I watched them and enjoyed them immensely. My mother served a tour in the Peace Corps in Malawi, Africa when she was in her 70s and loves Africa. The books and videos are true to the culture and are delightful to watch. My mother was so excited to receive them she has spent hours watching them with her friends. I would definitely recommend these to anyone of any age who is looking for entertainment that is outside the special effects, action packed realm or just enjoys a good mystery."
3,Not African.,"What a disappointment. American actresses who are too young, (well, Mma Ramatswe) too stylish, just plain too not African to make this series. Surely they could have found some real African actresses.I gave it three stars because if I had never read the books I'm sure I would have thought it wonderful.There's nothing wrong with the cast that they can change. But shame on the producers."
2,Buy the books instead,"I was very disappointed with this series and wondered why the writers felt the need to add characters and compress episodes. I felt the effeminate gay hairdresser added nothing to the series. Not only is he a cliché but the actor who plays the part consistently overacts the role. It is especially painful in the first two episodes. Did the writers feel this is a chick-flick series and that the addition of a gay hairdresser added comic relief?On the positive side, the acting by the principle actors is very good and it was fun to see the country of Botswana which is exotic and beautiful.This series also seemed a bit over priced with only seven episodes for $40. The books are far better but if you have never read the books you may enjoy this series."
4,Delightful DVD series,"We were very pleased with our purchase of this DVD series and it arrived very quickly. It is such a delightful series and we have to say we loved it so much, we even watched two episodes in one evening. We are hoping there will be another series produced, because we will definitely be purchasing more. We were told about this series by family, so have continued to pass on the good news to others. We thoroughly enjoyed a glimpse of life in Botswana and loved the characters portrayed in the stories."
5,"Wonderful stories, well told - and wonderful actors portraying the characters as written","I have loved every one of the Ladies No 1 Detective Agency books. I love their gentle wisdom and every character has his or her own charm and quirks. I was so very pleasantly surprised with the show as well and just bought the entire season to have and re-watch. Although, as with all shows, some things are not like the book(s), the thing that made me fall in love with this show was that all of the characters were just as I had in my head. And like the books, the stories have that same gentle wisdom and life experience that seems real and not contrived nor overly dramatic.I am very sorry that this did not continue but well worth watching."
5,LOVE IT!,LOVE IT < LOVE IT < LOVE IT!!! Only negative is that there is only ONE season! :( Would LOVE to see many more of these wonderful shows.
2,disappointing,"I was hoping they'd do a better job with the film version, but was very disappointed. I should know better - I usually avoid film versions of books I've liked. Corny, obvious, characters not true to the books, dumbed down for the American audience."
2,Too Bad,"I don't know why they had to throw in the token ""[...]"" character, when there is not one mention of homosexuality in the book??? The books are excellent and I really was hoping that I could watch something that was decent family viewing without the agenda...but it didn't happen. The books are great!"
2,Quality not what expected,"This product was advertised as ""like new"". I received it and the second episode on the first DVD was damaged and I could not view it. Very disappointed with this purchasedThe No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency. I enjoyed the episodes I was able to view."
5,I LOVE THIS SERIES!!!,"Its a shame that people who have read the books are comparing it to the HBO version. I haven't read the books, so I am seeing it with fresh, unbiased eyes. I LOVE IT!!! It is well acted, funny, and it transports you to a wonderful and beautiful place where people live regular lives who have the same hopes and dreams as everyone else in the world. I can't wait til next season!"
4,Wonderful Series on Flawed Discs,"As a fan of the Precious Ramotswe books, I was generally pleased with the video series -- at least, with episodes I was actually able to watch on the discs that I received. Warning: As soon as you can after receiving your order from this series, open and play it. I did not view mine immediately and found (well after the return period) that 2 of the discs I received in Set 1 are visibly flawed, and I could not get Episode 2 to play at all. A couple of other episodes stopped or stuttered in mid-viewing and I had to restart the video to get those to play through. A not-so-user-friendly menu made that harder than it should have been. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed the video treatment of the books' plots and characters, even though the stories sometimes were regrouped differently from the order in which the books presented them -- not a problem, as far as I'm concerned. If the set's discs had been high-quality, I would have given the series a 5-star review."
4,The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency,"Excellent series, great acting, beautiful location, interesting and funny characters. Love it!!!! No graphic violence or language."
5,Hoping for Season 2!!!!!,"I absolutely loved Season 1. I can't wait for Season 2. Hopefully, there will be many more seasons to come. If you haven't watched this - give it a chance. I have fallen in love with all of the characters and can't wait to see what happens to them next."
5,satisfying,"I have read all of the Ladies Detective Agency books and watch the National Geographic livecam Africa website regularly. This series was delightful. It really brought the books to life and was a joy to watch. The actors are well selected and the actions and places matched my imagination of them. It's satisfying and fun to watch, with beautiful settings and believable people. Thank you to the producers! Susan"
5,Botswana revisted,Enjoyed the Ladies Detective ( excuse me) THE NUMBER 1 Ladies' Detective Agency books. Botswana sounds wonderful. The casting of the story principals is beyond great. A real joy to have in my DVD collection
5,#1 Ladies Detective Agency HBO DVD set,"I gave this away as a gift to a friend who was leaving my place of employment and moving out of state. He loved the books as much as I did, but didn't have HBO. After seeing the series myself, I knew it was the perfect gift, and I was right."
5,Very true to life of Africa,"Ladies No. 1 Detective Agency is a fantastic series! I have read the entire series and have now watched the series. I lived in South Africa for 12 years and this series made me feel the sights and sounds all over again. It is very true to the book series, it was excellently done! I would very much recommend this for viewing, it's great!"
5,No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency,"Wonderful cure for the blues! Takes the novels and expands story lines, adds beautiful scenery and actors who give understated, warm, and believable portrayals of the characters."
4,An unusual treat!,"Usually a fan of series like Lewis and Midsomer Murders, this was quite unlike any mystery series I had ever before seen. The setting is of course like another character and is filmed beautifully, showcasing an Africa, (despite the criminal aspect of the series) we are so rarely shown. The characters are brilliantly acted and given depth which just made me wish I could actually meet them:) The stories in themselves are good, but not totally gripping, but the characters are really what make this show worth watching and what kept me truly entertained. My only gripe is that there weren't more episodes!"
2,Numer one lady detective,"Thr film is a hugh letdown after reading the book. Picturing people and places is so much more enjoyable than seeing the choices seen in the film. This is not true for all stories, but it surely is for the charming lady detective. I change mind. I give it only a half stat"
5,No. 1 Ladies Detective a 'must see'!,"I've loved reading all of the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency books by McCall-Smith,so was very happy to see that the TV program was available in DVD. There are a fewnew characters, some slight shifts in timing of a few events, but the acting, andwarm relationships between Precious Ramotswe, Grace Makutsi, and JLB Matekone are'spot on', as the Brits would say. Don't miss watching this set of DVDs, whetheryou rent them from Netflix or borrow them from a friend or buy them! I just hopethere will be more to come in this series!"
5,Precious,"If you enjoy this series of books by Anthony McCall Smith, you will enjoy this DVD. It is very true to the first book in the series and brings to life the characters in the book. I rented the DVD set to watch and enjoyed it so much I purchased it for my mother for Christmas. She is a big fan of these books."
5,Good Product,"We look forward to more stories. Great choices for the actors, especially Maa Ramotswe and Maa Makutsi."
5,no 1 Ladies Detective Agency,Loved the videos. For the most part they are true to the stories. It's great to actually see them come to life.
3,The audiobooks are better...but the film is pretty good.,"I enjoyed the film for what it is, but it ISN'T nearly as good as listening to the series on tape. The wonderful voice of the South African female narrator will take you far into the beautiful, successful, democratic, and thriving country of Botswana and its people and creates a place I sincerely hope to see someday.The acting here is pretty good...the film moves right along, and although it isn't faithful to the story, its certainly good enough in its own right."
5,"THIS IS DELIGHTFUL, FUN AND CHARMING STORY I CANT WAIT FOR THE NEXT SEASON",RARELY DO WE HAVE A FAMILY SERIES THAT IS SO CLEAN AND CHARMING AND FUN AND ADULT AS WELL . I JUST REALLY REALLY LOVE THIS SERIES I HOPE THEY DON'T WAIT TOO LONG TO BRING THE NEXT SEASON ON.THIS PLEASES BOTH MOMS AND DADS AND KIDS.THE CHILDREN IN THE SHOW ARE SO SENSIBLE AND PRESENT A GOOD EXAMPLE . THE MORALS QUOTED ARE SO HEALTHY AND NEEDED IN OUR COUNTRY TODAY.MAKES ME WANT TO LIVE IN BOTSWANA.
3,Probably won't watch beyond pilot.,"Although I typically stick with non-fiction, I've been reading this series for some weeks (book 4 next). Decided to try 1st episode $2.09 from Amazon on my Ruku. Was interesting to see the pretty close match to written story but was very put off by ""over the top"" portrayal of Mme's newly hired secretary. This personality is not even close to the key role of the endearing young woman in the book to the point where I am seriously considering not watching more episodes. The ""so called ""gay"" character addition was also not necessary but I guess ""That's Hollywood"" or Network TV for you. It's my understanding that ""gays"" pretty much stay underground in Africa anyway but what do I know?"
5,Really well done,I thoroughly enjoyed this series and can hardly wait for the next season. Please notify me when this is available
1,question for the other reviewer,"The reviever below laments ""European colonialism"" , and gushes about the ""vibrant continent"" of Africa. If this is how she feels, then why doesn't she move from the United Kingdom to Africa??!!??Because she knows that the standard of living in the UK is so much better! And those countries in Africa ( or anywhere else) that have benefited from Western (Christian ) missionaries and influence owe us much but will not acknowledge it.Sad."
4,Keeps your phone safe,Keeps your phone safe from scratches and drops. The cover only lasted about a year though and then it ripped. I would buy 2 next time.
5,Needed accessary for Razor V3,"If you own any version of the Motorola Razor, than this product is for you. I've bought at least 3 or 4. When you drop it, not ""if"" you drop it, it prevents dings and scrapes. Totally saved my phone numerous times. Also it will stick just about anywhere you put it. Caution if you have long hair. It will grab your hair and not let go. It fits perfectly and doesn't affect your hearing or talking ability at all. Or just use if you want to change the color of your phone. But its a must."
1,Defective merchandise,I had this machine set up for about one month and used it once or twice then when I did a tape to dvd recording the dvdr malfunctioned.Now I have to see about getting it repaired.This happens to be the 2d Go Video VR5940 I have.The first VR5940 which I bought last April '05 has been my workhorse machine and does indeed work very well.
1,This unit gets a 0and GoVideo's service gets a -5,Unit did not work out of the box. I ruined 6 DVD's trying to copy my VHS tape. GoVideo did not answer any of my 5 emails and so I called them and they do not speak english. The only positive thing I can say about this is that I bought it from Amazon. Amazon's service is a 10.
2,very unreliable! Short warranty - with a reason,"I have had this model for barely a year. The first recorder lasted less than a month before hopelessly locking up and refusing to eject a disk. It was a long and difficult transaction to get it replaced with a refurb. by Go Video. Quite unfriendly staff. The second unit has always been moody, and now rejects all DVDs, Pre-recorded commercial movies, DVD+/-Rs and RWs: spitting them out with ""unknown disk"" message. It has become an expensive VCR and CD player.Warranty is only 90 days for parts and labor; 1 year for parts only, and you are stuck with shipping - so it is not cost effective to ship it in for repair.I gave it 2 stars because the unit is wonderful and versatile - WHEN it actually works! But, unfortunately, it has been an expensive mistake and I have to replace it: but NOT with a Go Video"
5,BEST DVD RECORDER YOU CAN OWN,I have this machine and just love it. I had purchased other brands only to return them because you had to be a rocket scientist to work them.Go Video is so easy to use - just press the COPY button and you're making copies. So simple to use and the copies come out great. Highly recommend this product.
2,don't buy !!,Needs to have the cd cleaned a lot or skips or won't play. The worst is I make advd +RW copy. The next time I play the DVD the govideo vr5940 initializes the DVD with out letting me stop it. My copy is now gone.Tried e-mailing three times over months know responds.
1,GoVideo is BELLY-UP - NO CUSTOMER SERVICE,The item is useless. Out of the box the VCR did not work. Spent the better part of 9 months trying to find anyone who may have a working phone number or email to their customer service department. So far ZILCH. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM OR ANYTHING FROM GOVIDEO!!!!!!
3,how do you turn off progressive scan???,"I was doing fine with this thing for a while, but today I was watching a DVD of the Family Guy that I burned, and I was flipping through the menu. I decided to flip on progressive scan, because I didn't realize it was off and now it just says ""Progressive Scan Mode"" across the screen. There seems to be no way to turn this off. If anyone knows, please help. Thanks."
1,Noisy Fan,Nowhere in the product description does it mention that the VR5940 has a fan. Photos of the back of the unit have all been cropped to not show the fan housing. I plugged the unit in the first time and immediately put it back in the box to return it to Amazon. I called GoVideo and they say all their VR's have fans.I was also disappointed that the only S-video input jack was on the front panel. Has GoVideo not heard of satellite TV?
5,I'm Pleased,I wanted a combo unit that would provide as much flexibility as possible with the +/- formats as well as ease in transfering tapes to DVDs. I did a lot of reading on the net and settled on this unit. Amazon put me on a 2+ month wait however another supplier sent me an e alert on availability and I purchased from them. I've had the unit for a week and could not be more pleased. It does require reading and rereading the manual to understand its operation but the results have been satisfying.It is an excellent product that meets my expectations. I definitely would purchase it again.
1,GoVideo is not made to last!,"I liked this dual DVD/VCR at first. I was in the middle of converting all my home movies to DVD, when it froze while formating. Now it no longer will recognize any discs. I have tried the troubleshooting that is in the manuel, with no luck. I have not been able to reach GoVideo and since my year is just up, can not return it."
3,O.K. but you can do better,"First, the positives: Great color; user friendly set-up and menu options; Above average sound from built-in speakers; and simple to hook up to stereo system.Now the negative: Very heavy (183 pounds); cheap looking and cheap feeling remote, which is more complex and with smaller buttons than necessary; and the unit is very sensitive to a center-channel speaker. I took my first set back and exchanged it for another, only to find that my shielded center channel speaker, which worked fine with my 27"" Magnavox television, cause a strange ""shadowing"" on my Sony set. This problem is only eradicated if I move my center speaker several feet away from the set. I got no help from Sony or my dealer, other than to offer yet another exchange. Needless to say, at 183 pounds, this unit is quite difficult to keep loading up and tranporting back and forth."
1,The worst kids' video I've ever seen,"This is the worst kids' video I've ever seen. Whatever you pay for it isn't worth it. The 30-minute video began with about 10 minutes of sales pitches (previews) of other videos made by Kid Vision (all equally excrable). When the ""feature"" started, an incredibly loud, phoney woman came on as host. She made my toes curl. When the primates finally showed up, one was wearing diapers, which gives you a clue to the educational value of this ""Real Animals"" video. In other places, the primates cavorted with the kiddies. How it ended, I don't know. I couldn't bear to watch the whole thing. I bought the video for my 5-year-old grandson, but I have too much respect for his intelligence to give it to him."
5,My son's favorite bat,"I bought this for my 9-year-old son (53"", 66lbs.) to use this season in Little League, hoping that the extra weight drop (-13 here vs. -11 in his old bat) would help his bat speed. Seems to have worked, fewer strikeouts and more solid contact since switching to the LCN8, which is now his favorite bat. It's not too flexy, has a pretty solid feel and sound (relative to other composite bats, which can feel and sound ""soft"" in comparison to aluminum alloy bats), and very good pop. Keep an eye on prices if you're interested, as Amazon will periodically drop it significantly for no good reason that I can figure out; kept it in my shopping cart for a couple of weeks and ended up with a great deal on a great bat."
1,Evil must be Understood in it's Entirety,"The Communist manifesto goes along with such books as Mein Kampf which everyone should read, not because of their insight, wisdom nor to be illuminated but because the logic is flawed ideas are dangerous. Communist class warfare has killed 100 million people, it was and is an evil movement and it is important to understand the ideology behind the genocides of Lenin, Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Pol Pot and so on. This is not a book which should be referenced day by day but read with close attention to every detail to combat the ideology. A travel version will not provide full comprehension of the evils of Communism."
5,super read,This book was great I love the wAY SHE WRITES. iT IS LIKE SHE IS SITTING THERE TELLING YOU A STORY NOT WRITING A BOOK
4,Very authentic story...or so it seems.,"The Lady of the Glen is a novel based on the political wrangling and armed conflicts that preceded the Jacobite rebellion in Scotland during the 1700's. The story centers on the generations old feud between the MacDonald's and the Campbell's, and the love story of Cat and Dair who belong to opposing clans. I thought it was a great book, the writing style was a bit confusing at times, it is interspersed with text from the end of the story as foreshadowing (?). Or perhaps to remind you not to get too attached to the characters, which I did and then was a little reluctant to finish the story. Having gotten over that, I did finish and thought the ending was very appropriate. Overall, I liked it a lot. It was a little bit violent, even for an HF novel, but that seemed to fit the story. I am sure it was a violent time and these were passionate people."
5,Great Scottish Highland Romance,"Wonderful story, full of romance and true love but it also imparts knowledge about a tragic event in Scottish Highland history, the Glencoe Massacre. If you love Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series with Jamie and Claire you will also love Dair and Kat."
2,I take the blame,"I have to confess. I have made three attempts to get through Lady of the Glen. I can't do it. I know this book is a favorite of many, and I hoped it would be one of my top picks, too. I found myself skimming every time I turned the page. When I started skipping pages, I knew I had to stop.For my lack of interest in this book, I'll take the blame. I am going to assume that it is no fault of the author, it is all me. In truth, other than a couple of things that could be overlooked, Miss Roberson tells a good story. It really bothers me that I could not finish it. I can't express how badly I wanted to read it through and enjoy it.If you are looking for comments on this book before reading it for yourself, my opinion is, read it. This might be exactly what you're looking for.Carol A. Spradling, authorCarolASpradling.com"
2,Promising but disappointing,"I was impressed by Roberson's writing ability at the beginnning of the book--fine descriptive style and ability to create a coherent narrative around complex historical events. But the ""romance"" element in this book is pretty dreadful--""Cat"" and ""Daig,"" as well as Robbie and Jean, are totally unbelievable characters in any historical period. She would have been better off sticking to the main story--I might have finished it then."
4,Smurfy,"This dvd is okay. It is not as entertaining as the previous releases. The 5 episodes that are provided are a bit dull and Gargamel was not as prominent as most tru-blue Smurf fans would like. However, my daughter stills likes it, but wants to watch one of the other Smurf dvds when this one ends. I gave it 4 stars because the dvd does contain Smurfs."
1,This is not season 2,"I received this for Christmas and when I watch this, all the episode are from season one. None of the episodes on the cover are not on the disk. The 5 episodes on the case are ""S-Shivering S-Smurts, Turncoat Smurf, The Smurf Who Couldn't Say No, The Haunted Castle & The Black Hellebore"". On the disk, the episodes are ""The Magic Egg, Smurfette's Dancing Shoes, Supersmurf, The Baby Smurf, The Fake Smurf, Paradise Smurf, Sir Hefty, The Purple Smurfs, Haunted Smurf & Sideshow Smurfs"". These are 10 episodes and they are all from Season one. This is false merchandising and false advertisement. Not very happy about this. I love the smurfs and I greww up on them. Why can't Warner Brothers come out with season 2 like they did with season one."
2,Dull,"My 8 year old son and I both found this DVD to be extremely boring. Gargamel is barely present. The episodes are heavy on Johan and Pee Wee. I was a huge fan of The Smurfs from 1981-1985, and I don't remember any of these episodes. I guess I didn't pay enough attention to what I was buying."
4,"Smurfs Up, Dude !","The latest DVD of ""The Smurfs"" is a rather nice touch to your collection. (Especially if you have the first season sets available now.)This DVD has 5 classic episodes in over 90 minutes of smurfy good fun. Those episodes has the little blue denizens encounter new friends, new foes, and new adventures, too. They'll suffer a severe snowstorm, encounter an evil potion maker, and who knows what evil scheme that wizard Gargamel is up to ?Also on this DVD is an interactive Smurf village with character profiles and other facts you may or may not know about. Very nice.So this DVD may not be much and all, but it's okay none the wiser. Look for more new Smurf DVDs coming soon."
1,Stupid.........,"It's really sad to me how greed continues even with children movies.It would make more sense to me if warner would just continue putting out there 20-25 episode season's of the smurfs,and stop trying to make a buck by wasting time and energy to put out these crappy cheap overpriced greatest hits episode from the 2 seasons that are already contained in the first 2 smurfs seasons sets...otherwise great show and memories....geesh...greed...greed"
1,Yet another rip-off scheme targeting my childhood memories,"This DVD and the whole set in general is yet another grievous example of trying to suck as many dollars as possible for as little value as possible by the same types of executives who used to run record companies. 5 lousy episodes representing ""Season 2 Volume 1"" Using this math Season 2 would end up being as many as 12 DVDs. Really Hanna Barbera? This kind of greediness is the reason why the recording industry is now owned by Apple, who came in and picked up the pieces after file-sharing destroyed this kind of business-as-usual disregard for your consumers. What a garbage collection. Total waste of money not to mention space. I'd easily pay $30 for a proper Season 2 collection of all the episodes, but this kind of parsing out means I'm passing on this measly offering. And so should everybody."
3,I am Smurfed,Booooo...why would you not continue to release the seasons sets and only put out a few episodes. Are they not going to come out with the season sets anymore? I could deal with the episodes being out of order in the first two DVD's...but I want more smurfs :(Who can we write to so we can ask for the season sets...I don't want to buy those burned copies that are being sold.
1,Rip-off,Wish I'd read the other reviews before I ordered this. If I had I would not have ordered it.As others have pointed out this is not Season 2: Volume One. And no where on the package does it claim to be. But Amazon is labeling as such and claiming the $5.49 price is a 63% discount!Smurfs: True Blue Friends contains one disc with only 5 episodes. Total run time is around 2 and half hours.
5,Great item. My daughter loves the smurfs!,This item brings back a lot of memories of when I was younger and used to watch this cartoon. I wish all the older cartoons were on tv now for the kids to watch. The older cartoons were the best!!!
2,more smurfs,i bought season 1 both volumes and I really wish they would release them in seasons or at let volumes that have more than 5 episodes i love this show and used to watch it on cartoon network. Please Warner Brothers release the smurfs by seasons or by volumes with more then 5 episodes there are fans of the show out there and im one of them.
2,Nice effect but be warned...,...that the lens does not maintain the shape you select. The photos of the lens show it bent over so I thought that it would keep it's shape but was surprised when I received it--it is like a big spring that wants to return to it's normal shape. You need to keep your hands on it to maintain the position and any slight movement will change the effect. I returned it and will be buying the 3G that will allow the shape to be locked in.
3,A decent start,"The intersection of women's experience of and in relation to war is indeed an important and mostly neglected field of study. This book is a positive step towards this direction. However, the essays here are more cursory than substantial. This is a reader, an introduction of sorts, but the best readers collections most often consist of exemplary passages or works in a particular field. None of the essays in this collection have the weight to stand on its own. As a collection, this reader presents a sample of the major issues and areas of study being conducted today. At best, the book contains footnotes to more formidable and groundbreaking works."
5,Noel Gallagher...The Person Of The Year,"I live in Ushuaia, Argentina. This is a very dificult place for buying cd's from Oasis, because it is so far away. And I should want to say that this is an a exelent compact where Noel Gallagher explains lot of things. I hope all the world will listen to Oasis some day. Thx. very mauch... Lucas"
2,Having a hard time NOT putting it down,Oh for Pete's sake. I think he probably stopped reading her letters after the first couple (the lover) since they say the same thing over and over and over.
2,Should Have Outgrown Teenage Years,"The editorial ""blurb"" indicates that this book proves the inequality forced on women in the Antebellum South. I disagree! This pair of diaries proves that teenage foolishness did NOT begin in the mid-20th century! This woman married at 14 to a man who was obviously disapproved by her family and friends; forced him to leave her; did not obtain a divorce; married as a bigamist to a man who was also a bigamist; left him to be ""kept"" by a married man whose moral credentials one has no choice but to doubt -- and, the editor would like us to believe that these choices were ""forced on her""?! I think not! There is nothing that indicates that her first marriage was ""forced on her"" -- and that is the starting point of all the rest of her troubles. No sympathy here."
3,Would be much better if the wheels turned,"My parents bought this for our son, and he likes it a lot. But, he wants to ride on it and the rear wheels just don't move. We called the company, thinking that ours was misassembled, but, no, that's the design. (Probably for safety reasons, though they didn't say that.)In any case, because the wheels don't turn, its useful lifetime is much shorter than we'd like."
1,"Terrible, bad, very bad, disgusting.","I bought 2 of these boards. One as a gift for my family whose sink-side cutting board had finally cracked after 7 years of use and one for myself. I visited my family after they'd had the board only 1 month. It had cracked in countless places and was splitting all over the place. I was upset that they hadn't oiled it or cared for it very well.Since I knew it was prone to cracking I took my unused board and coated it regularly in mineral oil. Tonight I just noticed the first splitting in this board. I hasn't even been used very many times, maybe 10-20 and it's been oiled 3 times.Harder and more durable than maple? Maybe, but your glue is terrible and bamboo apparently isn't perfect for everything. I have a maple, walnut, and cherry board that I oil half as often that I've had for 10 times as long and it still looks brand new. Don't bother with bamboo, buy something else."
2,BAIT AND SWITCH,"I bought this book with great anticipation after having read Tullock's ""First Marine Aquarium"" published by Barrons. This ""Natural Reef Aquarium"" was a huge disappointment, and I liken the experience to having a student write a 5 page paper for an ""A"" and then expanding the same topic to a 20 page paper for a ""C"". This book rambles and meanders with far less focus and precision than Tullock's ""First Marine"" book. Gone are the useful charts and lists of different animals needs and compatibilities. ALso, he never seems to make a clear distinction between his own version of keeping an aquarium and that of the Berlin method developed by others. Tullock's ""First Marine"" book was inspirational, and was written with such conviction to really convey the radical departure of his methods. This book is full of filler, and major themes are tied together with the weakest of threads. My advice, buy the ""First Marine"" book, you'll get all the basic information and a lot more passion for the hobby."
5,Great Book,A well written and informative book. It is a terrific book to use as a reference to fish and corals with great pictures of most of the animals you would find in a home reef system. shipping was prompt and on time.
3,"Good, comprehensive book, but I'm not a marine biologist.","This is a great book for the person that has taken a lot of biology in college, but it's a little much for the average person trying to start a reef tank. Granted, I have learned a lot from this book, but I find myself having to read things over and over again and looking terms and species names (which there are a lot of) up for their pronunciations. I am very excited to learn about reef tanks and how to set one up, but this feels like a school text book rather than an understandable guide on how to do it. I do like the book, but you definitely have to have a dictionary next to you and the time to look up things."
2,Pretty book but misrepresented,"This book represents itself as a low-tech simplified reef-keeping guide. Instead the author suggests almost every gadget out there. Including calcium reactors, RO/DI, etc.I guess is was wishful thinking on my part that there truly exists a simple way to keep reef aquariums.It does have great pictures and is nice for inspirational purposes."
4,review ??,i am expecting the book to be a good one giving the inside i want to living filtration and a completely natural aquarium with very little artificial filtration help! i can not say yet if it will meet my expectances since i have order the book more than 2 months ago and i am still waiting for it....
5,Excellent for any and all Nancy Drew Fans!,"This is a blank journal that will be a hit for any and all Nancy Drew fans. Which, I admit, I am one. It starts off with the first page being the opening pages of the Nancy Drew mystery of the same title. Then the pages that follow are lined with every other one having a drawing from the Nancy Drew books in the corner. The last page towards the end then concludes with the last pages of the Nancy Drew mystery. The intent is obviously to make one feel like they are writing their own mystery in the journal. It is a medium sized journal. I've seen smaller ones and I've also seen larger more book sized ones. And the spacing between the lines is a comfortable one. I think I've bought this one about three times. I love it! There is also a blank Nancy Drew journal titled ""The Secret of Shadow Ranch"" which has the same format."
5,Amazing,"Carter Beauford has been named one of the Top 25 Drummers of All Time and this video shows why. It's not an instructional video, rather it is a showcase into the skills of this master. This video will blow your mind. I show it to anybody who is interested (and most people are, especially after they sit down at my drum kit and have a few whacks at it) and I have yet to see anyone not stunned by the ability of Carter. Very enjoyable to watch, and the experienced drummer can pick up some new ideas. The novice drummer may be overwhelmed, but on the other hand it may inspire him/her to greatness!"
4,Great Drum DVD,"If you like the Dave Matthews Band or just really good drumming, then you'll like this. The only downfall of this is that it does have a very steep learning curve, so if you're a beginning drummer, this isn't the video for you."
5,Thrilling entertainment!,"It's been awhile since I read a book I didn't want to put down - The Ripple Effect is one of those! You start off admiring Morgan's spunk and ingenuity then rapidly turn the pages hoping she just ""makes it""! It was the entertainment I was looking for - I loved it!"
4,Great Historic Reference,"This is a wonderful ""what if it really was that way"" story.Good writing done in a very imaginative setting."
3,Good action novel.,Excellent character development. It was as if Ms. Lywelyn was privy to the great rooms and the sleeping chambers of the royals.
2,Not worth it,"The fit is awkward and it does not go on securely. You also have to really watch the leg piece to make sure it does not pinch your baby's legs. It slides off easily. (Aside from this, Target took weeks and weeks to ship this. We won't order from them again.)"
3,"ooo, snap","I love the idea of a tray that ""snaps"" on, but unfortunately, it doesn't just ""snap"" on. I have the same problem as other reviewers, it falls off immediately and is very difficult to put on without pinching the child (that is, at least with an older child). I'd love to see it actually work so I hope the company can tweek it to work better."
4,Serves its purpose,"My almost 5 month old loves the bumbo and so do I. The tray allowes for her to play with some of her toys without me having to go constantly pick them up when she drops them. The bumbo/tray is also serving as a transition to feeding in the highchair. It did take a few times for me to get the hang of getting the tray on, but now works like a charm. The bumbo is just molded plastic - so there is no way you can get to high tech with accessories!!! For the cost I would recommend this product."
4,pretty good,The tray is pretty good. But it doesn't really clip on to the bumbo seat that tightly. My 7 month old can pull it off pretty easily when she decides to which can be a pain. Otherwise it does what was expected.
2,Not really a helpful accessory to the Bumbo,"Like a lot of parents, I purchased the Bumbo with high expectations. Yes, the seat is great for a baby, especially when they start learning to hold their heads up. I loved the Bumbo itself. When my mom bought this tray, I thought this could easily take the place of buying a high chair. NOPE! By the time babies are 6-7 months old, in my son's case, he was over the tray. He was easily able to remove it. The tray does not snap on, it can pinch easily, and continuously comes off. Clearly, as the title of the item suggests, it was literally meant to be only a PLAY tray. Still, I was disappointed in the quality of the item."
2,chair tray,"I like the idea of the tray attached to the bumbo chair but it does not have anything to attach a toy. In summary, anything you put on it will fall. It is something that needs to be improved"
4,Great Add-On For Bumbo,"Before purchasing the Bumbo Tray, my 4 month old seemed bored in her Bumbo because she couldn't play with her toys. With the Bumbo Tray, I can place her toys on the tray and she can grab them.Also, the Bumbo makes a great feeding chair. The Bumbo Tray is a great product because it gives her a place to put her hands and it prevents her hands (covered in cereal) from touching her clothes.Sometimes I have some trouble attaching the Bumbo Tray to the Bumbo. You have to be very careful so your little ones arms do not get pinched."
4,SOOOO Helpful,"I had one of those newborns that NEVER liked being put down. The bumbo chair was sent from ~HEAVEN~ I started using it when she was about 1 1/2 months, I was about to give up on it around 5 months because Rosemary was trying wiggle out of it. I heard about this tray and immediately bought it. It was shipped from Amazon and I got it in 2 days! Target was going to be 2 weeks!! It is not exactly what I thought it was going to be BUT I love it. It has NEVER pinched her legs, she has NEVER fallen out of it or even dropped it on the floor. It does not fit in as securey as I had hoped BUT she is now 10 1/2 months old and still using it and has stopped her from wiggling around. We use it everyday instead of a high chair, it conserves space. I can just put it on the floor or under the table when I am not using it! She loves it...and so do I!!!!"
2,"good concept, but book too loaded with errors!","This would have been a very interesting book but there are simply too many factual and typographical errors to recommend it. As far as I'm concerned, the book's only redeeming value is in the cross-listings given in each entry, which allow basic navigation through this genre for those who are new to it."
1,From The Author Of Asian Cult Cinema - An Outrage,"I really wonder about this author. He professes to love the Asian cinema so much yet what he writes about Asian men and women tend to be degrading. Regarding women, the author obsesses on appearance rather than acting ability. As for men, he has a tendency to lump them into a faceless, violent, crazed mass. I'm not really sure if this author means it or not, but his books have the feeling of borderline racism or voyeurism disguised as movie reference books. The subject of Asian cinema deserves much better than this and Asian people should be outraged."
5,Fiddler Fatale,"This is a wonderful sampler of various fiddling styles including traditional old-time, cajun, western swing and some things that defy categorization (check out Ducks with Bongos). Barbara Lamb is a superb fiddler and has assembled a talented bunch of back-up players who are virtuosos on their instruments, including Sam Bush and Tim O'Brien. The cuts offer changes of mood, pace and style and as a whole the album is an interesting montage of the possibilities of fiddling. Die-hard Blue Grass types might not appreciate Lamb's creative touches to standards like Sally Goodin and old-time traditionalists might not recognize Ducks of the Millpond, but I found her inventiveness amusing and her talent obvious."
4,"Good movie, Bad title.","This movie kept me interested from the very beginning. Asaka Seto is gorgeous and displays a lot of talent in this movie. I found a couple of minor characters a little annoying. Also, Maybe I'm mistaken but in one scene the assassin looks to have her sniper rifle scope on backwards. Some people might lose interest with this movie because there aren't that many action scenes, but I think if you give this movie a chance you will like it."
2,Just wasn't there,"I had high hopes for this film but it just wasn't there. Thought the fil moved a little slow for what I was hoping to see, mainly action."
5,A Compulsion of Scrutiny...or lack thereof,"[...]Carter's work speaks tomes on the intricacy, complexity, and intrigue of the human condition. It's hard reading, but rich reading. If you haven't the time, inclination, or, frankly, ability to invest in such a work you're probably better off sticking to periodicals."
2,broke after two years,"I bought this because I liked the user-friendly design and color, but it broke after a couple of years. I also had issues with cleaning: there was mold growing in the handle of the processor, which could not be disassembled for cleaning. It was gross, and possibly a health hazard. My mom's food processor has lasted her entire life and shows no signs of quitting. It's not pink and it's big and kind of ugly, but it was apparently made to a much higher standard of quality then the overpriced, flimsy appliances KitchenAid is selling to home cooks these days."
4,Please enter a title for your review,the most experimental indie/alternative rock music since the kelley deal 6000. the way one instrument steals control over what key the song is in from another is continually amazing.
5,Lost Elvis Song!?!?!?,"Is ""Did I say that?"" a Lost Elvis song remixed?It's similar to A little Less Conversation, but I prefer Did I say that?Very cool and very witty with the radio interview at the begining which i've never heard before..Someone tell me please!When did Elvis record Did i say that? i want to hear the original.DJ Hound Dog is definately as good as JXL! He totaly brings Elvis up to date.I also really like the track Johnny Famous."
1,"good,but nothing special",This book was good and did help a little but only on scenes you must do without exception.I would suggest a monolog book by peg kehret or some other title.I have found that Meriwether Publishing LTD. has a very good selection of wonderful books for this catagory.Happy hunting
4,lists,I bought this to share with my family during the holidays. They were a great hit with everyone. I actually think they will help relationships.
3,"Love the Idea, Girlfriends Hate it.","So I bought this as a joke for the girl I was dating, but I didn't think she would take it so seriously. Let's just say I never took them out again while she was around. But I still love the idea of these series of note pads."
2,Too complicated,This was suppose to be a gag gift during the holidays - but written in such a complicated manner - no one liked it.
5,It's so good it can't be British ?,"Good to see such talent from a British artist. The CD was ten times better that I thought it would be - having only heard a few tracks from Beverley Knight (Old Skool, Made It Back) . She isn't just a pretty voice, she's a talented songwriter as well, with meaningful lyrics that will get you hooked . Enough reading - now get the CD and listen up !"
5,A very thorough and somewhat deflating biography,"This is the definitive English language biography of Prince Henry of Portugal, known as ""The Navigator."" The author, a retired former director of Portuguese studies at Oxford, has researched his subject as thoroughly as the source material allows. As is the case with other exhaustively researched biographies, this one makes its subject appear less heroic than legend implies. Though Henry did sponsor the early Portuguese exploration of the West African coast, his motives were commercial and religious rather than scientific. Russell, describing Henry's failures as well as his successes, concludes that the Prince was essentially a man of the late middle ages, not the Renaissance. Nonetheless, Henry initiated the astonishing adventure of a small country extending its reach around the world."
4,Good buy,"I just bought this PC. On comparison shopping, it came out cheaper than an equivalent (almost) Dell system, and much cheaper than all others. No bundle, just the PC and tiny speakers. Packs a lot of computing power, memory etc for the money.Nice Soft keyboard & a sensitive optical mouse (cool). XP Home boots up really quick (~ 1 min), but the interface would take some getting used to, for windows veterans. Things have been moved around and hidden from plain sight.Jukebox(preinstalled) is a pain in the you-know-where, and does not run without registering, but is setup as the default player of all music files.More, as I discover..."
3,I got a lemon at first ...,"At the time I bought the HP 754n it had just been released and seemed like a good package at a good price. This was November 2002. I bought it and it ran fine, no problems, for about 2 months, but then it went haywire and had all sorts of problems. I had purchased the 3 year on-site service plan at one of the major appliance retailers. I called HP and asked about my in-home service and they laughed at me, I got nowhere. I returned to the store where I bought the pc and said I had got a lemon, and had purchased the service plan. The store manager admitted that there may have been some lemons in the first batch, and switched the pc with a new one of the same model. Since then, no problems, but I'm not sure if I would purchase another HP pc. I have just got a new Sony VAIO and so far I am pleased with it. The HP still works but I do not trust it, specifically its CD-RW drive. It sometimes makes bad copies."
4,Its Good and Tough,"I bought my HP in 2002 and I'm on it now.Someone said that they had multiple problems and with the HPs they purchased breaking down every couple of months or so and to that I say, you should find another dealer.This pc has really hung in there and is still going strong.The only crashes I have had were due to viruses when I did not have proper protection but I still have all my files (thanks also to my great pc doctor) and I had to upgrade the video card.My 14 year old daughter wants a laptop and wants only an HP because she's seen this one working from the time she was in 1st grade!"
5,Pedometer,This Accusplit is a good one that appears to be very accurate. I've used this model previously; that's why I sent for this one.Beware of the Accusplit pedometer that has the buttons on the side. I ordered that one first--and good luck trying to set it.
2,"Too complicated, but ...",This pedometer was way too complicated for me to set up -- five pages of small print -- but maybe that's to be expected for all the product offers. The manufacturer made it very easy to get a refund -- it was strictly no-hassle.
4,Excellent for the price ..,"I purchased this pedometer to replace one that kept resetting itself back to zero ... the case cover on this one protects the buttons so it doesn't reset. I like the fact that I can open the lid and read the LED without taking it off. My only problem is the little leash ... it came with both a plastic and a metal clip. The plastic clip has lost it's ""springiness"" and I'm sure will stop working soon; but at least I have the metal clip to fall back on."
3,ok,"It worked well for awhile, but for some reason it stopped working like it was supposed to. It would catch any movement that I would do all the way around."
3,Adds a few steps,"Bought this as a replacement and it noticed it not as accurate, but still works for a pedometer. Have used it for 2-3 months just as a basic counter."
1,pedometer,"This pedometer is so confusing & does not keep correct data information. Also it continues to work even when you are not walking., you must leave the top open or it thinks you are constantly moving.The instructions on how to use it are not helpful & my husband who is a technician had trouble figuring it out."
4,Good Product,It is really easy to set up. Had it set to my weight and stride length within 10 min. Easy to clip on.It close to 6 months so I thought I would add this. I have already had to replace the battery once. It is not hard to do and the battery can be found at most retail stores.
5,Pedometer,"Recommended by our nutritionist, very easy to 'set-up', use, see readings while wearing it! Stays on clothing well, easy to forget you're wearing it. Use it every day to try to get in 10,000 steps!!"
5,great pedometer!,"ACCUSPLIT AE170 Pedometer with Steps, Distance, and Calories BurnedI bought this pedometer to aid me in a weight loss program. Right out of the box it was easy to use, which is something I appreciate. I don't want to spend alot of time reading instructions. With a press of the mode button, you can see how many steps you took, in what amount of time, the distanse traveled, and the calories burned. One of the best features though, is that it comes with it's own safety clip that you can attach to your pants. It has saved me from loosing it several times and I wear it every day. When I looked for a pedometer, I wanted it to be easy to use, accurate, easy to read,informative,and capable of lasting for a significant amount of time. This pedometer has all of those features."
4,Fun Steppin',"Good quality pedometer. Wore it along with a cheapo one and this one is definitely more accurate. Only issue: it overcounts steps when I go on staircases. I never use the distance or calories burned, but these features interest my kids. It's been a great incentive to keep moving!"
1,wouldn't buy an accusplit again,"The accusplit was suppose to be an accurate product, but it has been far from it. I contacted the company and after questioning me they said yes it seemed to be a ""dud"" and they would send me a replacement. It has been almost a month and I have not received a replacement or heard further from them after emailing them again. Save your money and avoid the accusplit brand."
4,Marketing hype,"Seems to be a good product, but I'm a little ticked at the marketing hype ""98% accuracy rating"". When calibrating it for your stride, it only allows you to enter the length of stride to the nearest quarter foot. Three inches is almost ten percent of a typical stride. A built-in ten percent error makes it kind of hard to get ""98% accuracy"". To be fair, a typical stride probably varies that much over a hike anyway, but how hard would it be to let you enter the number in inches, for goodness sakes."
2,Not worth your time,"Don't bother with this item, not worth the asking price. Item was dented and not very well made. The pump is not very good either, didn't pump adequate amount of water to run the fountain very well and didn't last but a few weeks. The photos of the item looks good but that's about all that's good about it."
4,"a lesson from the ""Professor""","All things considered, ""Test for Echo"" was the perfect album for Neil to do an instructional video all, especially for beginning drummers; he tones down the amount of fills and pure techincal playing to focus on the songs as a whole, as well as his own pulse, or groove. (Although the Rush fan in me definitely wishes he did a video like this for all his albums). As he breaks down each song, one can realize how much goes into even the most basic level of drumming. As a side note, it helped me to appreciate ""Test for Echo"" to a much greater degree, particularily deceptively simple songs like ""Half the World"" and ""Carve Away the Stone"". Equally worthy to Rush live videos like ""A show of Hands"" and ""Grace Under Pressure""..."
5,All hail the Professor,"I have always been a fan of Neil since I started playing drums sometime in the mid-90's when I was in 3rd grade. I have the VHS version of this video, but it has still been watched at least five times a year since I got this for Christmas when it first came out. A man of great talent and humor, and almost makes the things he does look easy. Fan or not, this is a must buy for all drummers. One thing I recently noticed while watching this the most recent time was at the photo montage at the end of the second video was a picture that kind of depressed me; it appeared to be a shot of Neil from behind sitting in a stadium setting with who I could only assume to be his late wife and daughter...very sad"
5,WOW!!! uh yeah WOW!!!!,Prehaps one of the best drummers in the world today and all you have to do to learn some of his licks is pop in the DVD.I've played drums for 14 years now and I would attribute probably 70% of my licks and style to this man so as you can see I had to have this when it came out.This DVD not only contains the songs from the Test For Echo album and how to play it but how Neil came to be the drummer he is today. He talks about the mechanics behind the new style that he has implamented into his playing that he learned from Freddy Gruber and explanes why they work for him and how they could work for you. Neil also disects the songs and goes over the hard fills.The only draw back to this video is that he dose not play the fills slower him self but slows down the film. This is not anything to be concerned about though. The DVD also contains a preformance only feature that lets you view his playing the whole Test For Echo album.So if you are a drummer buy this.
3,Great concept... wrong album,"I found it a great idea to break down Neil Peart's drumming on a whole Rush album, but honestly I can't agree with the album choice for this project: ""Test for echo""? Come on, give me a break. I mean, I guess ""Moving pictures"" would have made a much proper choice, just to name one.So, if you're looking for a DVD to actually show you *how* Neil does what HE does on some of the finest Rush tracks, let me suggest you ""Rush: Legendary Drum Licks"", pefrormed by Jamie Borden (Hal Leonard Corporation).There you'll find an extremely accurate breakdown of Spirit of radio, Freewill, YYZ, Red barchetta, Limelight, Tom Sawyer, New world man, and Subdivisions.Besides, the DVD in question is a whole lot cheaper."
5,A must-have for Peart fans,"If you're a Neil Peart fan order this video before you do anything else today! This DVD is simply top-notch. Of course, we've come to expect quality work from The Professor for almost three decades and this DVD maintains that fine tradition. Stop reading about it. There aren't enough words in any language to do it justice. Buy it now!"
1,Self-Indulgent Waste of Paper,"Anger's biographer Bill Landis says this book was written in great haste, and I'm inclined to agree. It consists of shallow, badly-written anecdotes that wouldn't be good enough for the Weekly World News. There's a set of photos of Liz Taylor in her ""fat"" stage with no accompanying story, and that's a waste. The best part of the book is the one about Alex Pantages, who most readers have probably never heard of, so for that I'm greatful. But the rest is nothing but lists of actors who died from drugs. Anger could've written a great article on John Landis, and how he got two children killed while making the Twilight Zone movie, or Heaven's Gate, the most expensive flop of all time. But instead he just throws stories together.Lighten up Kenneth. Your bitterness ruins the book. If you really want to write a bestseller, why not track down and interview the ex-stars? And why not write about what you've been doing for the last 30 years?"
1,Short life span,"These boots are really cute on my 2.5 yr old, and he LOVES THEM. While they lasted, they were great. I purchased them in March, and by the end of May (3 months later), the soles were completely worn down, and there was a big rip in one of the ankles...waterproof no more. My son is not hard on his shoes. Most of them look barely used by the time he grows out of them. We usually hand all of his shoes down to his cousin. So...if you're only looking for a 3 month shoe...this is it. Our last rain boots we bought are still going strong on their beneficiary."
2,Super cute but not durable,My 2 1/2 year old son loves loves these boots. He's been wearing them almost everyday for the past two months. He loves to stomp in the rain puddles with them. He has had them for only 3 months but I saw a big tear on one boot and lots of cracks on both boots. I love the cute factor but am disappointed in the quality. It will be hard to convince my son to wear other boots but these don't keep his fee dry anymore.
1,"these boots were as cute as can be but very poor quality.... the seams up the back split and lining pulled away from boot, not","I purchased these boots (2 pair) for my grand sons, they did not even hold up for the spring season!!! the back seams split on both pairs, the lining is pulling away from the boot..... very disappointed in the lack of quality!!"
5,Great kid rain boots!,"My 4 year old grandkids get these boots every year for Christmas. They love them. They slip on and off easily with no adult help. They can splash in the water and their feet stay dry. When they get muddy they are esy to wash off, Lots of patterns to choose from."
4,Spiderific rain boots,My 3 year old loves his rain boots did not want to take them off for the first 3 days.!!! Awesome purchase.
2,Not at all durable,"We bought three pairs of these boots last fall / winter. One pair was Spiderman, the other two were monster theme. They all ended up with the seam at the back coming apart after a dozen or so wearings, making them no longer waterproof. I had had good experiences with this brand in the past but these seemed very poorly made."
5,Brooklyn to Israel,"I just gave it to my grandson a few days ago when I arrived in Israel. He loved it right away but the weather was too beautiful in Israel to wear until today, which was rainy and he wore it for the first time. He was looking forward to wearing them and looked great in it and will probably be able to wear it for close to a year because he generally wears a 10 or 10 1/2 shoe so I bought the size 11. It was roomy enough without his foot slipping out. Since today is the first time he wore them I really don't know how they'll hold up, but I'm hopeful."
5,Perfect product,it really help light my spots. I feel different in only one week. nice product to recommend to people who want to reduce spots in the face.
4,Great Product!,"This is my first time using Japanese facial product. This one really surprised my a lot. The smell is really good and its not greasy or sticky, it just absorb into ur skin in just a few minute. So far I haven't seen any change in whiten yet but I am positive about it. Great product, worth the price."
4,Could be better,"i had high expectation for the product but it is not a surprising lotion. rather than that, it doesn't do worse than the others i've used but not better either."
5,OH YEAH,IF MR. AIKMAN TELLS YOU HOW TO PLAY FOOTBALL YOU BETTER LISTEN! I'LL TAKE YOUR SECRETS ALL THE WAY TO THE OCEAN AIKMAN!
1,Worst CD I've ever purchased.,"You'll be sorry if you purchase this CD.While the orchestra is perfect, and the singers are also perfect, this CD sounds like it was recorded with only one (1) microphone. And that microphone was in the middle of the orchestra.Which means that every time the singers come on, you have to turn the volume up to hear them, and when the orchestra comes back on, it blasts you.And since this is a vocal driven opera, this CD is horrible.Suggest you spend your money on a well recorded version of this opera."
5,An American Odyssey,"I spent hours browsing the sobering and, at times, shocking stories of these aged and infirm inmates in the prison system of the southern U.S. The portraiture, stunning design and layout of this book made it a thoroughly engaging read. I only hope the ""Prisoners of Age"" exhibition itself comes to the east coast so that I can have a chance to see it in person."
5,Great Read!,"Been a fan since the 'Viva Terlingua' recording first hit my turntable back in the day. Actually purchased an autographed copy for my wife on her birthday and finally got an opportunity to read it myself.It's a great read with Jerry Jeff his ownself's style evident throughout. From Ronald Clyde Crosby, Jerry Ferris, Jerry Jeff, Jacki Jack and back we are along for the ride. Don't miss the insight into the life of Hondo Crouch and Luckenbach, the funny twists surrounding getting Mr. Bojangles on the air, and how Gary P. Nunn's ""London Homesick Blues"" was put on the Viva Terlingua album.Finally, I think this is one fine and well deserved valentine to Susan. It's worth the read to see JJW reinforcing family priorities as he acknowledges his role as father first, entertainer second."
4,One of the best music autobiographies out there,"Jerry Jeff has succeeded in writing a simple, straight-to-the-point autobiography, documenting his unorthodox life and musical career. While it won't go down in history as a fabulous piece of literature, Jerry Jeff will most definitely hook the reader into his story, refusing to let go until the last page is read. Another wonderful aspect of this book is that being a die-hard fan is not necessary to enjoy the book (unlike so many other music autobio's). After finishing, I loaned the book to a friend of mine who was not at all familiar with Jerry Jeff or his music. After reading the first couple of chapters (to the accompaniment of the CD I loaned him as well), he was hooked and wanted to hear more music by the man who's lived such an incredible life. If the opportunity arises, read this book. You just might be glad you did."
5,Scamp Walker,"Jerry Jeff Walker takes us on a wonderful ride through his life. From his boyhood days in New York to his ramblin' life as a street singer in New Orleans to his present home in Austin Texas. Walker discusses the places and people that have made him one of the most endearing (and enduring) songwriter/perfomers of our time. His anacdotal accounts of leaving home, his wandering lifestyle as a street singer, his writing of ""Mr. Bojangles"", his entry into (and out of) the Nashville scence, and finally his magical connection with Austin Texas. He holds very little back discussing the problems of drugs and alcohol and the partying lifestyle so prominent in much of his music through the years. But in the end the book shows us a survivor, A LONE WOLF, who rediscovers himself through his wife and children. A wonderful insight into the life of one of the most underrated song writers ever."
4,Lots of history of early 70's country crossover music.,"Lots of history of early 70's country crossover music, mainly the Austin type. Walker discusses his great colleagues and influences while remaining personally humble. Lots of high quality pics.""The world I come from and how we played music is gone. They call it progress."" -Chet Baker"
3,Very little in way of how to.,Offers more information regarding what is available regarding the different branches of kinesiology rather than a how-to-manual. As a visual person I felt the drawings left alot to be desired.
4,Good introductory book,If you are interested in learning Kinesiology then this is a good start. It tells all the different forms of Kinesiology and has some useful self-help tips
2,Thin Florentine veneer over mysterious melodrama,"If an author sets his story in one of the most colorful cities in the world, the descriptions had better breathe more than the stale air of guidebooks. And if the author wants his heroine to struggle with the feminine mystique and religious faith, then he's going to show the character development through more than long, long paragraphs of maundering musings. And if the author wants his sensitive Italian detective to be sensitive and Italian, he's going to have to write dialogue without the strong flavor of, perhaps, New Jersey. The saving point of The Last Castrato is its author's ambition."
2,The Arno moves faster than this novel,"The plot of this novel is very promising-a serial killer, a castrati, but the continual philosophizing of the characters stalls the pacing. No sense of place is created, no feeling of Florence, Italy and I've been there. The author resorts to cliches ( to hell in a handbasket was used twice). Is that an Italian cliche? If the novel was supposed to be a police procedural, it missed the mark; I got the idea that Abati and his partner made up most of the police ranks and there wasn't much procedure. And the meandering through philosophies just got to be much. A good plot line not handled very adroitly. Try Donna Leon's Venetian policemen; he's good without pointless pilosophical wanderings."
4,Good overview of California glaciers for the general public,"I essentially agree with the previous review, with the exception that the absence of references to J. P. Schaffer's work on glaciation in the Sierra Nevada should not be viewed as a problem with the book. Speaking as a glacial geologist who has worked extensively in the Sierra Nevada, the public should know that Schaffer's work has repeatedly failed to pass scientific peer review. Until it does so, it would be irresponsible for other authors, like Guyton, to present it in any publication purporting to be a synopsis of current scientific thinking. Guyton has done a very commendable job of summarizing the latest CRITICALLY REVIEWED thinking on timing and geomorphic effects of ancient glaciation in the Sierra. I would recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about modern and ancient glaciers of California."
3,Christmas gift,Bought this for my Granddaughter. It looks in real nice shape. She loves these books.There was a mix up in book sent but as soon as that was cleared up it was OK from then on
1,AVOID this HP Product - Batteries do not recharge.,"This HP docking station does not charge batteries. It will give you error message ""Batteries cannot be charged"" when batteries run low. After spending weeks e-mailing and calling HP ""support"" I am about to give up. This an $80.00 plastic holder for your camera. Very dissappointing. HP sells to the US, they should have customer support in the US."
4,Tiger and Crane Fists,"Kung Pow's dazzling effects and sampling sparked intrest in the original movie it was made from, Tiger and Crane Fists. I just had to get this movie to see how the story really went, and find out if it was originally a sci-fi movie at all. This is a very emotional story of two adjacent clans in China that learn the hard way that they must overcome pride, combine technique, and unite to overcome the ruthless oppressing Master Paine or Betty.The picture quality is ok, sound (music&effects) is retro, but in a cool way, and dialogue was before its time (suprisingly)I enjoyed this movie, and I think anyone would who was intrigued by the masterpiece Kung Pow."
5,More Kung Pow for your Buck,"Greetings all,I'm a huge Kung Pow ETF fan. I had to have this video! I got it and was glued to the film. I would have liked to have the credits though."
2,Dissapointed,misleading by picture no food comes with it. cheaply made. Wish I would have realized it before purchased.Learned a lesson from this purchase
1,Don't waste your money!,"I got this in the mail today for my daughter for Christmas and I don't think I'll even give it to her. It is so cheaply made and definitely won't withstand my 3 year old playing with it. By the time I paid to ship it, it was over $30! Total waste of money during difficult economic times!"
4,Romance And The War On Terrorism,"An entertaining book about a second terrorist atack in the United States. A secret US Government group devises a plan to retaliate and send the terrorist leadership a ""message."" The action and the romances among the four main characters moves along quickly. There's suspense, combat, and sexy romantic relationships that are tested by war's uncertainties and fears. Excitement and fun."
4,Very Pleased,"I read this book based on the recommendation of my husband who is big into ""war stories."" Initially, I was thinking that there would be no way I would be interested in a novel with a military type focus. Boy, was I wrong. I was pleasantly surprised that this had a love story threaded into it. I got the best of both worlds and ended up being very pleased overall with the book and the several twists the story carried me through! Strongly recommend!"
4,Falcon's Impact---Action and Romance,"An entertaining book from today's headlines: Terrorist attack in US; Covert team plans to kidnap two top terrorists in retaliation; 4 really cool people become envolved and end up in two torid romances. Good pace, action, sexy romance, suspense---what's not to like. It's a good ""read it by the pool"" book. Try it---bet you'll like it."
2,Skip the Romance,"For a first try, this is not awful, but Mr. McElhaney has a long way to go to be a 'good read'. All of his main characters(there are four of them in this book) are perfect beyond belief. They are the most beautiful/handsome, smartest, bravest people imaginable. If the author would stick to the things he knows and stop trying to be all things to all readers, he would have a better book. The romance(sex) scenes are embarrasing and read like someone's wild fantasy rather than a serious portrayal of human affection."
3,Not for beginners,"Unfortunately the book comes with a chord chart fingering explanation (inside front cover) which is a bit ambiguous. i was really hoping for a finger/fret position chord chart diagram over each chord but that's not the case. So, i would recomend this more for an intermediate and up guitarist."
1,A waste of paper,"This is yet another failed attempt at trying to arrange and print Bossa Nova music. The melodies are there and intact, the harmonies not faithful, and the rhythm??? wait, there's no rhythm whatsoever. The most important thing in Bossa is the rhythm, the author overlooked that here. One of these days I am going to stop buying books on brazilian music by anybody that doesn't have a Portuguese last name. So if you are looking to play washed down poor quasi brazilian guitar solos, this book is for you, otherwise stay away!"
4,can handle a lot and multiple hole location,"There are 3 depths this can punch (how close the hole is to the endof the paper)...without the gray separators, and the separators turned one way, or the other. You can also change how high or low the holes will be on the paper...you can change out the punches if they get dull, and you can move them for 2 hole punching as well.And it tears through 40 pages with no problems.highly reccomend it."
5,Gorgeous book!,"This book is absolutely gorgeous. I have even given it as a gift, too! I have only used a few of the recipes, but they have all worked great! But more than anything, it is just a lovely book to sit and enjoy!"
3,Not the greatest music,"I was disappointed with the music in the video, not very fun. I also found some of the moves a little difficult, but that is just because I have 2 left feet ;)"
3,10 minute solution Fat Blasting Dance Mix,movements are good music has no beatwould be more fun if music was more up beati acturally burn more fat on my treadmill but it does take longerprefer the PILATES cdmore specific to parts of the body
4,10 minutes is better than Zero minutes!,"Drop off 3rd grader, grocery store, bank, post office, home for quick lunch, answer email while baking cookies for holiday party.Look at clock, realize I have 45 minutes before picking up 3rd grader at 2:30.So quick change, pop in the 10 minute solution, program three 10 minute segments, do workout, towel down, grab car keys, pick up 3rd grader.Voila, I have managed squeeze in a 30 minute workout!This DVD has been great for me - I was barely making it to the gym twice a week and now on those ""back to back"" errand days I can still get a reasonable (for me) workout in. Short workout is better than no workout!And yes, the pre-programming aspect is very useful as you can vary the workout everyday without repeatedly using the remote after every segment, which is what I saw as a shortcoming of other short segment exercise DVDs I had purchased before this one."
4,Pretty good,"I'm a 19 year old college student with a few hours of free time a day and so I usually take about 2 hours a week to do some of these workout segments.When I first started I realized how clumsy I am because I could not do 100% of the moves. I still do what I can and it makes me feel great afterwards.My only suggestion to those who are thinking of purchasing this is to take it a little bit at a time instead of jumping into 30 minutes right away like I did. It is easier to get a hang of the kind of moves you'll be doing then. Overall, I'm satisfied with this DVD and I find it kinda fun to work out in this way."
3,Fast moving,"The description for this video says it is easy to learn. I'm not so sure about that - the host does explain the steps very well, but the pace is fast and is hard to learn if you have two left feet like I do. I wish I could do all the segments but I feel lost when trying them."
2,10 minute solution fat blasting dance mix,"I bought this dvd to do after school as part of our faculty wellness program. This is definitely not a program for beginners. My biggest disappointment was that there was not enough repetition of new moves for us to learn them before she was added more new moves. It was a totally frustrating experience. I am not sure I will ever learn the dance routines, no matter how many times I watch it. This will definitely be in my next garage sale."
2,dance review,"I ordered this DVD based on the positve reviews. I think it would be a fine DVD for someone who already knows ""how to dance"". The moves are just too professional like, they are hard to learn/put together for someone who is JUST learning. I've tried it a few times but will be giving it away to someone else as it is more frusterating than anything."
3,Disappointed about Music,"I was looking for an exercise DVD that would be fun to dance to. I was hoping for good dance music. So I was disappointed in this DVD because it doesn't have good dance music, just the same background music with dance moves. I was able to do the dance moves, there were only a couple of moves I had to rewind a few times. And I'm not sure about the ab moves where you move your rib cage - I can't tell if I'm doing that correctly. I will continue to use this one for a while, but I'll still be looking for one that has fun music to move to. Maybe I should try a Jazzercize one."
1,Too much in too little time,"Great concept, but too many moves stuffed into too little time.I bought this on a recommendation from Prevention (if I remember correctly, it was a while ago), and it seemed simple. Not so. I have other dance workouts, so it's not like I can't learn moves, but it's just too much to learn and put together in a 10 minute time span."
4,Love Jennifer!,"Jennifer Galardi has quickly become one of my favorite instructors for my home workouts. Simple dance moves, but they definitely get me moving and having fun. Great instruction from Jennifer for a poor beginner like me."
2,Could Be Fun....But May Be Frustrating,"As I've noticed others have said, to have fun doing this video you will probably need to have prior dance training. I found it very frustrating because she would lightly touch on how to do a move and then move on. Since I was trying so hard to stay with her, it wasn't much of a workout. For people who have prior training, I think it could be a good selection because you won't get bored with instruction on how to do moves."
2,fat blasting,"I also give this two stars cause you get your hear rate up in trying to keep up.I did work up a sweat, but I felt silly trying to do it."
3,Dance Moves,I bought this DVD to add a bit more activity to my day but some of the moves are confusing for a klutz like me! I'll probably still use it but maybe not every day as I intended.
2,Cardio,"Thought it was more of a fun dance blasting video, in return it was just werid steps and just didn't work for me."
1,not for me,I thought I'd switch it up and buy a different kind of workout video (usually do Jackie Warner or Jillian Michaels). This was not my style. I didn't feel like I was getting a workout.
4,Good workout,This video gives a good workout but the dance steps take some time to learn. The dance moves really get your heart rate racing within a short time. I like the fact that you can do the individual workouts or pick and choose which ones you want to doOverall I think this is a very good DVD
3,Complicated dance moves,"I am a huge fan of the 10 minute solution workout videos, so I love that this one is also broken down into segments and is customizable. However, I find that the dance steps are a little complicated for me and I end up feeling so awkward while I am doing them. I end up spending more time wondering why I can't get it right than actually sweating! I think if you have any kind of dance background, then you will like this one, otherwise stick to the fitness ball one or the pilates. They are good!"
2,Hard to follow the dance moves.....,"This is one of those DVDs I have that sits on the shelf. I am not a dancer but I also didn't think I had to be one to do this workout... wrong! I could learn to do it, but it would take more time than I'm willing to spend. I have another 10 minute solution videos that I love (pilates), but this one is just too hard to follow. I'd rather spend my time getting my heart rate up than trying to follow the steps."
3,not very fast paced,"I just did this tape for the first time. I am not in very good shape, but still consider myself an intermediate exerciser. The moves were fun and easy to catch on to, but it was not very fast paced. I did start to sweat, but my muscles did not really feel a workout. The abs section is great though. I'm going to stick to this tape for a few weeks until I'm ready to move on to something harder, but I do NOT feel like this is a challenge in any way. Great beginners tape."
5,Wonderful,I love this DVD. Each dance section is quick and fun. It keeps me motivated to learn each move perfectly.
5,Zumba zoom zoom,"This 10 min. selection Zumba is awesome. I can do the entire 50 min or any portion and set my own routine. Can't beat the price. So far I'm doing the entire 50 min. workout, but when I'm not up to par I find it perfect to do 2 of the 1st 3 workouts, and ALWAYS the last two (butt, thighs and abs). They are my favorite. Music isn't very exotic but the dance is fun and easy to learn after the 2nd or 3rd time!"
5,"Great instructor, great variety","Jennifer is a great instructor. I like the fact that the outfits are different by segment as it helps you remember the workout better. The ab routine is fun and there are no floor moves. I had misplaced this for a few months, and I was so happy to put it in. I initially was going to do 3 of the 5, then got so into it I finished the remaining segments. I think that says enough."
4,good for beginners,"Jennifer is an excellent instructor. Easy to follow, good music, nice images. It's a perfect dvd for beginners. Although I prefer her latin rhythms and hip hop party as they are more for intermediates with faster movements."
2,Great for Choreographers,"This is great if you're a choreographer and already know every dance move there is. Unfortunately, the instructor does not go over the moves slowly, so you're left to flail about trying to figure out what she's doing while trying not to trip over your own feet. If you're like me and not a great dancer, this is not the video for you. Try something else instead."
4,Great starter dance exercise tape,It's a great dance exercise tape for beginners or for people who don't dance a lot. The variety is fun and easy.
2,Not for people without dance background,"I thought I would be able to do this video even though I'm not much of a dancer, but I WAS WRONG! I looked like an idiot trying to keep up with her. I was sweating alright, but not because I was doing anything right. She moves pretty fast and doesn't really explain how the moves work. She just expects that you can watch and follow along. I found her annoying at times because she talks to you like it's so easy, no problem. For people that are good dancers, you would get tired of this too because each segment breaks down the dance routine at the beginning, and if you've already gotten the hang of it, you won't want to keep going over the moves individually. I tried all the segments just to see if I could benefit from any of them, but I couldn't. The Ab Attack one, is probably the worst. I felt absolutely nothing in my abs. She says, ""You'll look great, I promise."" There's no way her 10 minute ab workout is going to get you in shape."
4,"Passes the ""use"" test","My wife actually has started using it, so it must be all right! I picked this one based on the mostly positive reviews, but you never know until it gets into the user's hands. She seems to enjoy most of routines. Thanks for everyone's feedback."
5,EXCELLENT DANCE WORKOUT!,"I really enjoyed this DVD! I did some research prior to ordering it as there are so many on the market to choose from. However, my research paid off as I am thrilled with this workout dance video. Being a former ""Club Hopper"" from New York City, I was looking for something ""Stylin and Raw"" not some corney dance steps by a bunch of Barbie dolls! This DVD is easy to follow, gets the heart rate going, and makes you feel like you're in a club. The instructor can really move, which really motivates you. A MUST BUY!!!"
3,"Fun, but doesn't make you sweat","This exercise is fun, but it didn't really make me sweat too much compared to the Kickboxing. I have a feeling you really have to get into it in order to make it be a great work out that you can feel. However, the dance moves were tricky enough that I spent more time trying to focus on the steps as opposed to working my muscles."
2,too hard moves,well I am not a dancer by any means but I guess I thought I could still do this because it would be simple. I am very athletic and play a lot of sports so I am in shape but I couldn't follow the dance steps. If you can't dance you will have trouble with this one but for everyone else it is probably a good choice.
2,Not easy to follow,I opted for the 48 hour preview. I have a fused neck and other health issues so I need an exercise program that works with me.I thought dance could be within my scope of capabilities. I liked that it was a 10 minute workout as my asthma limits my workout time.I found the tape too fast paced and the moves were not easy to pick up. Not all of us are dancers. Maybe more attention to the introduction of the steps would be nice.I am still searching for the dance exercise tape that works for me!
2,Wanted to like it,"I love to dance. In fact, since purchasing this product, I've gotten involved with another form of dance exercise we all know. (Hint: it starts with a ""Z."") I really wanted to love this DVD. But the instructor goes so fast, it is impossible to follow the steps. Now I am no slouch. I took dance classes for 8 years in my young days, and though it's been many years, and I've never been the best at following choreography within 4 seconds of being shown a series of steps, I DO have the ability to catch on. I suppose if I watch/use the DVD every day, I'd eventually get it. I've tried 7 or 8 times now, and I'm still not getting it all. I'll keep trying because it's a decent workout. But there must be others out there more appropriate for the out-of-shape boomers."
3,Need to be coordinated!,"I thought this would be challenging and boy was I right! I just don't have that much skill, but I'm hoping that I can catch on soon!"
5,Good DVD Workout,I was able to do the workout twice before my apartment was broken into and this DVD was stolen. It was really good for beginners. I'm not that coordinated and there were a couple of moves that i had trouble with but she does it so slow at first that catching on wouldn't be that difficult.
3,fun workout,"The short, 10 min sessions are great for when you are tight on time. The steps are easy to follow and pretty fun while still getting a great workout!"
4,Fun workout,I do this when I need a change of pace from my every day work out it breaks up the monotony of doing the same thing all the time and it's lots of fun.
2,Fat blast - Too Fast,I consider myself a pretty fast learner but I found this video a bit too fast and not enough time spent on instructions/demo so unfortunately I got frustrated and gave up. I think the moves are good so for those of you who learn quickly with little instruction - it may be perfect!
2,Am I THAT clumsy?,"I really didn't think so until I tried this video. It is a comfort to me that other folks couln't follow or keep up. By the end of the first ""basic"" segment I felt like a complete loser and hopelessly frustrated. She'd keep saying ""Did you catch that?"" and by the end my response was, well, unprintable at the least. The workout definately got my heart rate up, but it was more stress than excersize, as I couldn't follow her at all. Fuhgettaboutit."
4,Still evaluating!,"So far, I enjoy the routines and they're not too hard to do! I'll let you know if it helps get some of this LARD off my butt."
3,"Just okay - not ""Fat Blasting"" at all","This DVD was okay - and not ""Fat Blasting"" at all as the title says. The instructor was pleasant but the music was not so motivating. This one might be good to do on days between the hard workout days or just for a change when you want to try something new. I wanted to incorporate FUN (=Dance) into my exercise routine but I started to realize that it is not so fun after you remember the choreography - it becomes a routine. Dance workout DVDs often spend a lot of time repeating the moves so that the viewer will learn how to do it - but by the time you learn how...it just gets boring. Maybe it is just me."
2,Very Cheesy!,"I can't do this video even for 10 minutes! It is so cheesy and the girl has such a fake attitude, it irritates me for some reason. I guess I like a little bit of cheer with a little bit of straight forwardness and seriousness. But if you into extreemly bubbly personalities, this would be for you."
2,Not fun ...,"This was not fun, wasn't really danceing and pretty much a waste of money. Not any better than all the other work out I already own."
4,Good Exercise Video,"The Jennifer Gilardi Fat Blasting Dance Mix is a fun video. I like her style and personality. I would not say it is a KILLER workout - but it is a good one - especially for beginners to mid-range. The only thing I do not like is that while she is EXCELLENT at teaching - once you learn it - you wish there was a section on the tape where you could switch to just pure exercise, no teaching so you can get a better workout once you've learned the routines. That's my main problem with it. Once you know it - it just moves too slow."
2,Difficult unless you are a dancer.,"I've done several years of ballet and gymnastics and though some of the workouts were fun, the choreography was way too hard to pick up in such a short time. So unless you are gifted in dance, this may not be the workout for you."
3,"Good, but with problems...","I like the idea of this video, however I wish they had a segment that just teaches you the basic moves before you even get started on the workout. I find that for those who are not coordinated, it takes a while to get some of the steps down - and they move pretty quickly. I do like being able to customize the segments.This should come with a warning though - it's very difficult to do this workout on carpet. So unless you have hardwood or other smooth hard floor surface, I would pass..."
1,Do not give enough time to learn the moves,"I was really excited to get this video. I have the 10 minute solution kickboxing, which I love, so I thought this would be great too. Boy, was I wrong. I did, or tried to do, the Fat Burning segment. After five minutes into it, I was so frustrated, I shut it off. For starters, the music is super lame and completely uninspiring. The instructor is way too perky. But, the real problem I have with it is that she would ""describe"" how to do a move and then just jump in without slowing it down. Now, I have taken a few dance classes here and there, but this was way too quick to keep up with. I know it's a 10 minute segment, so they don't have a lot of time to work on the moves, but maybe add less moves and give people a chance. I will be giving this to my sister, who will hopefully get more out of it than I did. If you want a better workout, with a better instructor with moves you can actually learn, do the Kickboxing workout."
3,"Good, but not for me","I bought this based on the reviews. There were some people that said this was not for beginners or non-dancers, but many, many more that said it was good for everyone. I thought it would be a fun workout, but it wasn't. This is not a bad DVD, it's just not for someone who is not coordinated. The moves are not difficult, and they are easy to learn. But there was too much going on with the arms that I just couldn't follow it. It's not a matter of knowing how to dance or how fit you are - it's all a matter of how coordinated you are."
4,Fun dvd that will get you moving...,Jennifer Galardi is a great instructor. She is peppy and upbeat but not annoying. I have her Crunch Dance Party DVD and i have tossed it. This one is a better work out. The 10 Min Solutions dvd's are a really great solution. You can pick and choose the areas you want to work on most with the time you have. Some of her moves you won't get the first time around but if you stick with it you will see results.
5,Great workout!,"I just started with this and woah! My abs are sore! I'm a novice at dance, so I do the first 10 minute session along with the butt and thigh and ab workouts. This 30 minute combination is great for me! I would recommend this as she is good at instructing in what to do and the moves are quite fun!"
3,Great for those with little time to workout.,"Because Jennifer breaks up the workouts in 10 minute segments, you can do as many or as few as you have time for. The moves are easy enough to follow along with (first time out) and you have fun learning and getting ready to bust a move on the dance floor! I find because I'm dancing, it doesn't feel like a workout. However I am sweating and burning calories while getting into it. I simply press ""play all"" and do as many as I have time for. There are 5 segments in total. Definitely worth the $ and I really love Jennifer Galardi's enthusiasm - she sure knows how to move those hips!"
2,SK needs to stop changing the rules,"I'm a little tired of her series. The sex is still hot, and the interplay between the characters is still interesting but, I think I'm done. Every book, the author changes some rule she set in a previous book. Are the Daimons good guys or not, is Savitar a good guy or not? I'm a little tired of it."
4,Unleash the Night,"""Unleash the Night"" continues Sherrilyn Kenyon's successful Dark Hunter series. This was not my favorite book in the series because it was a little darker than some of her stories and also revealed the bear family, some of my favorite continuing characters, as potential villians. Wren was a compelling hero, with all of the expected angst which Kenyon does so well. Her heroine, however, was a little too predictable. This was a good book and moved the Dark Hunter story along. But Ash did not play a very big role in this story and I missed some of the usual suspects. If you have never read Kenyon's work before this is not a good work to begin with. If you are a Kenyon fan, then the story does not disappoint."
5,Amazingly sweet book,"I'm always a sucker for wounded heros and Wren, the hero, definitely rates as a very ""bad"" boy. Wren's father was a tiger and his mother was a leopard and Wren beleives that his father was murdered by his mother and that his mother tried to kill him as well. Wren is seriously anti-social except for his pet monkey and prone to vicious fights, until he meets the heriorne and then, well, love heals all, or at least it does in books. He still fights, but as our heroine (who grows from a proper senator's daughter to a force to reckon with herself) points out, Wren only fights when the other guy hits first. All around wonderful romance, built on the premise that love makes us stonger individuals, brings out the best in our personalites, and transforms people into better members of society."
3,Unleash the Night,This Dark Hunter Novel didn't immediately grab me like the others but it is an interesting read. It has the action and magic of the Dark Hunter Novels but it is more a coming of age book. Wren is not only an orphan but is a forbidden blend of two animals that are a lethal combination. That combination causes other were animals to be afraid of him and they tend to walk softly around him. Wren doesn't trust the other were animals either. He becomes fascinated with a senator's daughter but he doesnot know how to interact with weres much less humans. I found the love story more interesting than the other issues that created the conflict surrounding the couple.
3,"Read it for the story progression, but I want the books like they used to be!","If you are a fan, as am I, of the Dark-Hunter & Katagria series, the book is a must read to follow the progression of the overall story and character evolution. However, this installment won't win over many new fans as have earlier books. A quick read & light on content, the book is not as richly detailed as earlier efforts- it's almost a Silhouette/Harlequin style story as were Winter Born and Dragonswan.Some earlier characters do show up in the book (thank you!!), but sadly, no Acheron. I will buy the next release in June, but the hurried feel of the last few stories are taking its toll on the fans."
5,I LOVE WREN,"I don't know why people don't like this book but I love it.Wren was a shy hero, but protective and powerful. He appealed to me more than a rogue. The way to solve their problem (Maggie was human, not mated...) was new and more interesting than the previous books, IMHO.Wren ranked up number 1 together with Valerius and Vane. :)"
2,Not for Me,"This is the first book I've read by this author, having heard so many good things about her books. Maybe this type of writing is not for me. I had trouble with the dialogue between the characters. It seemed so made up, and I kept getting turned off by conversations which I could never see actually taking place. I have to admit, I enjoyed the new book of J.R. Ward (Dark Lover) so much I'm afraid I'm spoiled in this genre."
4,a first time great read,personally as i have never read any of the other Dark Hunter novels before i can personally say that they're magnifique! Wren is the almost typical bad boy upon the first glance but as an ameuter writer i have to say the portrayal of all charachters and the comlexity of the plot to focus in the 3rd person pov is great. Maggie notices only the differences at first... not to spoil the ending... but eventually you find that the more you read the more you just want five more minutes to go on reading.HAppy reading!
3,Unleash the Night (A Dark-Hunter Novel),"I read a lot of Mrs. Kenyon's books and found this one to be not as exciting or interesting as many of her others. It seemed that she was trying to get a book out of the way. Although I enjoyed it and would recommend it, I found it to be a far cry from the quality of writing she has put forth previously."
4,Loved it!!!,"This was fantastic. Kenyon did a great job showing the conflict in Wren's life at the begining. And her ending was perfect as well. We did not see Ash in this one, however, nick did make an appeareance at the end. A new light was cast on the image of the Sanctuary and racsim among the were-people. We experienced Savitar, the supposed trainer of Ash. As always, Kenyen leaves us salivating for more. It was a beautiful, if a little different from her norm., novel. I can't wait to read her next."
2,the series is slipping,"I was a huge fan of these books through Night Play; but the last two have been real disappointments. I didn't care particularly about Wren or Maggie. I also disliked how a female character from prior books; who was portrayed as very loving was suddenly written as cold hearted and a killer. I think Kenyon needs to focus on the Dark Hunters and leave the secondary species (Were Hunters and Dream Hunters) to short stories in anthologies. We haven't seen a memorable hero or heroine since the early books. I said in a prior review of the second to last book in the series that I thought Kenyon was spreading herself too thin; since she's also writing two other series as Kinley McGregory. The quality of the Dark Hunters' series, which I really loved, is suffering."
5,very Good,These Dark Hunter Novels just keep getting better and better. I can hardly wait untill the next one arrives because I can't seem to put it down untill I am finished reading it.
3,Minor spoiler - not much - too convoluted!,"This is another side story book about were-hunters. This time its Wren who we read briefly about in a previous book. Another tie in this book to the other books is through Savitar, who is Ash's mentor.This book seemed longer than most because of the underlining mystery of Wren and his story. It got convoluted in the end. Example: ""If Grayson was alive to accuse you before you came back, then I must have brought him back in time to kill him after you left."" Huh? Whatever. Sex scenes were hot. Don't worry...I can read that line a 100 times and not have it ruin the story for me. It barely makes sense. Unbelievable ending, but what else is new.I would recommend as I continue through the books. The familiar theme of love and redemption is still there."
4,A little better,"This book held more appeal than the last two, but it wasn't on par with Fantasy Lover or Night Pleasures. Wren and Maggie had a good dynamic but as happened with Night Play, the first half of the book was devoted to the here and now while the second half was a crazy time jump from sins of the past to the condemnation of Wren in present day. And what is with the Ash of the were hunters? Strage but I'd read it again."
2,Disappointing for a Kenyon Book,"I have read all of the Dark-Hunter novels, and eagerly awaited this new one. I was very disappointed. The characters didn't hold my interest as they had in the past. Some parts were difficult to follow and understand. It almost seemed that Kenyon changed her mind and added twists last minute while writing; twists that were unfortunately not well thought out and planned for.Of course I recommend reading the book - especially for strong Kenyon and Dark-Hunter fans - but be prepared to be disappointed. If this was the first Kenyon book I read, it would probably be the last."
4,Another great one in the series,I love this book series and this one was no disappointment. We get to know some new characters and we have a good love story. Can't wait for the next book.
5,Very beautiful old crochet designs for tablecloths,"This book has 23 very beautiful crochet designs collected from thread-company instruction pamphlets from 138-1952. It also has 43 black and white illustrations for these tablecloths. Two of the designs are for filet crochet, the rest are for motifs that are repeated until we get the measurements we want. I would say this book is not for beginners. But because the close up photographs of the motifs are in most cases very good one although a beginner could attempt to make some of the designs"
5,Sugar Plums,This is the best bluegrass Christmas album I have listened to. If you like bluegrass and would are looking for something to put you in the holiday mood this is the CD for you. There is a good mixture of artists and a good mixture of musical styles to make up a very enjoyable CD.
4,My favorite Christmas album,"A really good Christmas album. This is the first one that comes off the shelf the day after thanksgiving at my house. Communicates the miracle of Christ's birth and the significance of the incarnation in a down-to-earth, thoroughly enjoyable and moving compilation. All that and it is still a load of fun! I love ""That White Christmas Song."" What a hoot! Everything is tasty and well-executed. Normally I don't go for compilations but this one is a real gem. I think the Bluegrass Cardinals tune is not one of their better efforts, but is still ok."
5,At it again!,"In this wonderful sequel to Bill Bergson, Master Detective, Bill again finds himself trying to solve a mystery with the the help of his friends Anders and Eva Lotta. The best part of this book is that Bill isn't really anyone special - he might pay more attention to things happening around him than most, but he's no Encyclopedia Brown. The book also has a wonderful innocence about it and, even though it is set in Switzerland, only the names prevent it from happening in your own backyard.A great read for children of all ages (I'm 41 and loved it when I read it at 14 too)."
1,RIP OFF!,This is not CHLOE. It is a scam. It is made of water and alcohol. Now I have to send it back and pay even more for the shipping. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!
2,NOT the real Chloe that we all remember...,"While the price was fair, the packaging secure and the shipping fast, this is simply NOT real Chloe. I have an tiny amount left of the real stuff and I've compared them side by side on both my wrists. This Chloe smells different and it leaves a sticky residue on my skin. I did a little Googling and discovered that the original perfume company has been sold and this new company changed the formula. SO disappointed. I've been wearing this for 25 years and never found anything close."
4,Wonderful replacement for standard blade,"I use this blade on a Dewalt 709 Compound Sliding Miter Saw. I purchased it based on reviews on other woodworking sites and while there were others rated higher, it was hard to justify the dramatic increased price of the Forest or even other Freud blade. I have had a Freud 10"" combination blade in my tablesaw and have used a Freud 8"" stack dado set for about 10 years and have had absolutely nothing but good experiences with both. This 12"" cutoff blade is such a treat, especially after wearing out the original DeWalt blade on a deck, a complete refinish of a basement and installing hardwood flooring on one floor of a house. I thought about just getting the blade sharpened but there was almost nothing left to sharpen. The Freud blade is so quiet and cuts so smoothly that there have been times I've had to check to see if I really did shave a little off the board or missed completely. Heartily recommend this blade for CSMS users."
2,Too much impossibility for likable characters,"OK, so with the first two books I was able to overcome some credibility challenges, but I DO have my limits. While the characters remain strong, a transormation of one is so totally out of character as to cause rolled eyes in disbelief. An escape from hightly-motivated armed captors? I don't think so. Adolescents performing surgery without training? Yeah, right. Book one's creep of note facing the music? Only if the castaways really did come to some reasonable return to civilization. If a reader is willing to put up with such incredible happenings, there's pleasure here, particularly in the cohesion formed by the youngsters and their coming to a good end. But that's more than this reader could come up with."
5,you have to read this book!!,"This book was great it was well writen and fun. Escape (Island ,3 )was a great ending to the thirogly. I loved all three books but this one was the best. The kids acted realistic and courageous. I highly recommend this book ."
3,"The book is great, but I gave it a three because of false advertisement.","I was expecting the strategy guide, but I only got a book that is essencially the same thing as a behind the scenes dvd or a making-of... documentary. If I didn't love cars and Gran Turismo 4 as much as I do, I would have returned it and given it a 1, but it's still a cool book for whomever wants it. It details everything that went on with the series from the first game up to presently, but it is NOT a strategy guide."
2,Not what was advertised.,"A guide book was advertised. This is a book about the making of Gran Turismo. It's a nice book, but don't expect it to teach you how to drive or tune your cars."
2,Disapointing,"Not enough product detail so when it came in, it was not the DVD that I thought it was."
3,looking back---in a manner of .....,"i read this book the other night....for lack of anything else....and was blindsided. i live in a small town in Southeastern Ohio...and i know for a fact that many young women lived the life in this book in the late ""80s-early""90s.....and earler.....sex/drugs/rocknroll....i am 57 years old....grew up in the 70s thru college and all...and this is one of the saddest books i have read about COMING OF AGE....i wish i had a daughter/grand daughter...i would force her to read this harrowing/beautiful story of life on the EDGE....no glamour at all"
1,Swimming Sweet Arrow,"This was the worst book I have ever read. There was no development of the characters, the storyline was weak, and the language was vulgar without conveying the point at hand. Don't waste your time with this one!"
1,Yuck!,"I thought this book was pure trash. I didn't like it. I had to stop reading it, all it was about was sex. There just didn't seem to be any plot other than them having sex and their sex lives."
2,A Coming of Age Story?,"When I finished reading this book I really didn't know what to think of it. While reading it I constantly felt like I was reading a trashy romance novel with all the explicitly sexual imagery and at other times I found myself wondering if the plot was going to go anywhere at all. The book is described as being a coming of age story of two best friends, but I think it is just a teenage pornographic novel. I probably won't read this book again and even though it was only two hundred pages long, I feel that my time was wasted on this unsatisfying book."
3,Puzzled,"I kept reading this novel thinking it surely must be going somewhere. Sadly it didn't. I'm amazed that so many readers liked it. A story of two girls/women who think of nothing but sex. It rules their lives. It is their life. Of course, being a novel, no one gets STDs, AIDs, etc. Are today's women really this empty headed? For this is an empty story."
2,Talk is Cheap -- not at $ a clip it ain't,"Interviews are O.K. However, two hours worth is a little too much. The four ""musical"" tracks featured on this CD are very old, pre-Ed Sullivan Beatles songs. Although I am glad that Pete Best is getting some recognition. Let's face it, the very early Beatles weren't the musical giants they turned out to be in 1964, and afterwards. The early Beatles were crude and rough, just learning their ""chops.""This ""interview CD"" is also a bit contradictory. The title is ""Savage Young Beatles."" However, Disc 2 features one of the last interviews that John and Yoko conducted. This is very misleading.Talk is fine. But, I would like to have a little more singing from the best band in history. I would definitely avoid this CD -- unless you are an absolute Beatles fanatic who needs to own everything with their name on it. Then again, if this is the case, you wouldn't care what I have to say; you will buy it anyway."
1,WTF,"How many pieces come with in this order? It would be smart to list a quantity! I can get 16 of these in the store for under 3 dollars, but I want to by them in bulk. I make custom coasters and I use these on every piece I make.How much does $29 get me???C'mon Amazon... you can do better than that!"
4,Complex story that keeps your interest,"I read this book in 4 fours during a cross-Atlantic flight, and enjoyed it immensely!Arthur Dimond's rich homecoming tale has enough complexity to fill three books, but his choice to weave a narrower thread through it all is a good one, and makes the book a very meaningful but easy read. Instead of becoming mired in the many complexities or detailed examinations of the main character's past, his life on the road, and his family relationships, Dimond presents these as meaty background to lend perspective to the homecoming event itself. Much of the book is an examination of this event, and Dimond's realistic account allows the reader to experience it with much of the same emotion and difficulty as the main character does.Dimond takes an intricate tale and tells it in a believable, easy to digest way, without losing the powerful themes of forgiveness and family that give this book its depth and strength."
3,not really interactive,"I think that this book had alot of ideas for cute bulletin boards, but it's not interactive as it says. I am in a DAP workshop, and needed to make interactive areas out of wasted space. These boards are more interactive b/c they are made by the students, rather than interactive board space for them to be involved in activites. I'm sorry to say it's not worth 30-50 dollars, the book itself has a price embedded for 10 dollars. Sorry to disappoint; if your looking for a Developmentally Appropriate approach."
4,A nice find,"This was agreat idea for a quilt book. It involves a boy, who demonstrates interest in quilting from old scraps, along with his other family members. The illustrations are fun, the story is clear and the general instructions are thrown gracefully into the book. Upon reading it directly to my children, I would stop every few pages and ask my child a question, or have a mini discussion about what was happening at that part of the book. When I read it to a class of 25 Third graders, however, I am afraid that the Rhyme style became somewhat monotonous to them, and I had to work hard to keep their interest by changing the meter, talking to them, and actually skipping a few lines here and there. Otherwise it was a great book, and I especially appreciate that the lead character was a regular modern day boy who was nevertheless fascinated by quilting. I consider it an excellent find."
5,Childhood favorite,"I love this book. I'm 41 and just re-read it after all these years. It was my favorite when I was a kid. It still holds up today. Great writing, great story! Judy Blume wrote those kinds of books who helped shape me and feel like what I was going through as a kid and teenager was normal. Can't wait until my daughter is old enough to read it."
4,Good Book,"This was a great book giving a look at a teen's method of dealing with grief. The character development of Walter and Bitsy was the most fascinating to me in how manipulative they were even though their intentions were honorable. This is not my favorite book, but I recommend it for a young person who is dealing with the loss of a loved one."
5,This is one of the best books I've read!,It has suspense and it's dramatic. There should be a sequel
4,This book is about a girl struggling threw her fathers death,"Davey is a girl whos father just died and her family is moving . Davey has to adjust to her new enviornment and struggle the tears and lonliness without her father. Davey meets friends and a boy in particular. He conforts her and makes her feel good. Find out more about this great book when you get the chance to read it and find out how this book get it's name ""Tiger Eyes""."
3,Tiger Eyes a good read.,I thought this was a very interesting book with alot of helpful detail. It is very depressing and dramatic. So don't read it on a day when your not exactly in a good mood.
3,Tiger Eyes,The book was good but I have read better it is about a love story and things that people go through in life. Her dad dies and they move away to their aunts and Davie meet this guy named wolf he calles her tiger eyes he moves aways and she gets drunk with people.... in my opinion if you like love storys you will probley like it is a cute book.
5,Tiger Eyes,"This book is a total page-turner because it is about a teenage girl named Davey Wexler, that had a normal life until her father died from being shot in the gas station he owned. Her life is flipped and now she, her mother, and her brother are emotional messes. Her Aunt Bitsy and Uncle Walter take Davey's family to their house in New Mexico so they can settle down and re-gain strengh from what has happened. Davey starts to take everyday bike rides into the hills because she wants to be by herself when she meets a boy named wolf who keeps a sad secret that is similar to what Davey hides from him. This teenage drama is a terrific book because it tells all the feelings that Davey goes through in this situatuion. So if this book sounds interesting to you then I recommend reading it."
4,"Realistic and Vivid, but Depressing","For starters, I think Judy Blume is a wonderful, inspiring author. I like this book, but it was sort of depressing. It didn't make me feel happy after I read it, but it is a good book if you like things like that. The book was depressing in the beginning, but it ended happy! So I did like it."
5,This book was excellent!!!,"Tiger eyes was a very inspiring book. It catches your attention and always keeps you reading. ""Tiger's"" character has so many different views of life amd love and death. She was strong and in love with two men whom she couldn't stop thinking about. The way Judy Blume wrote Tiger Eyes shows how much she had put her heart and soul into her books. She has very high talent and I think Tiger Eyes is a good book for anyone 10 and older."
5,This is one of the best books I have ever read!,I first read this book when I was 11 years old. I have read at least once a year since then (I am now 16) This my all time fav because there is such a realism. You can feel Davey's pain. You feel like you are there with them. Trying to help them make though this tragdy. I have never been so connected to a character before. I treasure this book as a classic.
5,Top notch characterization,"After reading Forever I went on a bit of a Judy Blume kick, trying to find all the ones I missed that are aimed at teenagers or up (I'm not sure I'm up for an MG novel). I'm determined to figure out how to write normal life scenes this engaging. It almost seems like she could have the characters do anything and make it a fascinating read. They shower, they change their sneakers, trim toenails -- all stuff that is generally forbidden in writing guides -- and yet it works. Tiger Eyes could have been like an after school special. In fact, it probably was made into one. It's about a 15 year-old girl whose father is killed in a hold up, and she has to learn how to deal. It's not preachy. The people are just real, the friendships real, the family dynamics real. The early 80's Los Alamos setting is even interesting. There's no sex, no violence (other than the retroactively occurring murder), but there is a lot of excellent dialog."
5,The only book I enjoyed reading for a book report,"Davey Wexler is a 15-year-old girl whose family hasn't had it easy. After witnessing her father's death, her family goes to visit her aunt and uncle in Los Alamos, New Mexico. She befriends a boy she meets in a canyon called Wolf and a man in the hospital dying of cancer. In the story Davey deals with leaving those you love behind and moving on. And along the way, she discovers herself."
2,"Poor workmanship, but a good budget box","I needed a new development box and webserver in a pinch, and this machine's specs and price perfectly fit the bill. However, when it arrived, the CD-RW drive was improperly installed, loose and recessed inside the case instead of being flush with the front of the bay. I cannot comment on the bundled software, as I wiped everything and installed Linux on the first boot. The performance from this machine has been wonderful over the year it's served me, despite the physical defects."
4,VERY Good Desktop Computer,Versatile and powerful for most users. Recommended for Small Office & Home Office.
5,Disney HIstory,"This book gives you a daily ""dose"" of Disney magic. It is written in a calendar format and many interesting facts. A must for Disney lovers!"
5,I am a engineering,I am a beginer on cnc so I want you give me some detail book I can chose it Thank you for your help
4,"Solid Debut, [but] Needs Work","Like all ""idol"" debuts, this album lives up to her vocals and she makes every song a very fun listen to, but like all debut album's it is also a little weak, The songs and her vocals need to take it up a notch...'Blue Skies' IS a great pop album, especially if you are not into the sexual ways of Lindsay Lohan [who cant sing a note compared to Diana]. Even with some weakness, this album is a must-buy and great album in it's own right."
5,Diana DeGarmo is am amazing young girl!,"I cannot believe how amazing this is! Diana, at such a young age(16 when the album was released) .. it didn't recieve much recognition to say the least, nor on the sales chart. Buy boy is it a gem, every song thrives in emotional solitude. It enriches your soul, you can really find inspiration in this CD. People can criticize the songs for their sound, but I think they sound that way for a reason, they are that way because thats the way they are supposed to be sang, they sound PERFECT to me. Keep singing Diana, i'll always buy your music!"
5,absolutely 5 stars,"Diana is a breath of fresh air to those of us who are used to the pathetic yelling we normally get out of music today. Diana sings well, and doesn't oversing, or strain her voice.. It is effortless, truly gifted singer."
5,Very Nice!,"I really admired the beautiful Diana DeGarmo on AI last year. Her voice really matured and grew as the season progressed. And this album is wonderful! Lovely voice, wonderful ballads, fun teen tunes, what more could you want?I especially enjoy the songs ""Don't Cry Out Loud"" and ""Go On and Cry"". These showcase Diana's raw talent and potential for more great things in the future.I look forward to playing this a lot at home as I relax and also while driving. It's got variety enough to keep your interest and never get dull or boring.Great job Diana! Can't wait for the next one!"
1,Try Again,Another AI failure. it keeps getting worse. Proof a talent show can't produce stars. This a cd with noise just thrown together
1,Stop the Screaming!!!!!,How in the world did this girl get a recording contract??? The chipmunk album that I had as a child sounded better! Sheesh I have a headache now. And can anybody say OFF KEY?????????????She couldn't carry a tune if she had it in a bucket! I do not think she will sell very many!
1,Thank goodness,"Thought I would give it a try....it was only 10.99 so that is all I lost. She doesn't sound comfortable....and it makes me uncomfortable to listen to it. I saw it on sale...thought maybe a Norah Jones or Vanessa Carlton clone. Started listening and the first thing I thought was ""oh no this is one of those one cd AI people"" even though I have been blessed to never have seen it.....pulled out the inner liner......DOH!!"
1,Hope she can swim,I think the ship has sunk! This is not very good material and Diana is flat on almost every note.
5,What a voice! American Idol Loser is a WINNER!,"Thank goodness for Clive Davis. It is hard to believe this young girl was ever in the bottom three in the A.I. Competition. Simon Cowell constantly 'dissed' her but she never let that interfere with her performance. If anything it gave her more determination to show her talent. She continued to choose songs that for most would be difficult but would showcase her talent. She improved with every performance.She is a young girl that has her head on straight. She knows she has what it takes and her self-confidence sees her through.Not even Simon could shake this young girls confidence.Most of the songs on this album are good, but her performance of the song 'Go On And Cry' is FANTASTIC! Everytime I hear it I get goose bumps.Diana we are so proud of you and look forward to hearing your future albums. BEST OF LUCK TO YOU ALWAYS. You are a star!"
5,Diana DeGarmo / Blue Skies,"This Cd is fantastic, music and vocals are strong especially the song ""A Boy Like You"". You won't be disappointed, I wasn't. I highly recommend this Cd x 5."
4,Best of the new American Idol albums!,"Surprizingly, I voted for Fantasia to win, but Diana's album is the best of last season's artists, including Fantasia, George Huff, and the news ones from Tamayra Gray, Kimberly Locke and Kelly Clarkson. Definitely a Hilary Duff sound to it. If you like Hilary, you like this album!"
5,she is sooooo good,i dont understand why she did not win americanidol fantisa cant sing for nothing this show is a ripof diana is the ture AmericanIdol
3,Does Not Quite Connect,"This is a nice fluffy album that is entirely forgettable. Which is all the more the pity because of Diana's tremendous talents that should leave a more lasting impression. The songs are by and large forgettable, teeny bopper stuff.It was definitely a wrong decision to record Don't Cry Out Loud over the original music soundtrack, and an even worse decision to have Melissa give her some tips.That robbed Diana of the fresh feel and interpretation which she would have given the song to make it more updated and hip. Now it just sounds constricted and dated. What a pity.What she really need is great songs to showcase the awesome purity of her voice and the tremendous technique in her singing style. That is enough and will leave a more lasting impression.Let's hope her next album will see that come true."
3,Oh Diana....We don't cry for you.....,"Diana DeGarmo has a big voice, a cute face, and a charasmatic personality. However, none of that came out on this album. The material is the leftover crap they through out from Kelly Clarkson's album. I think people want her to be a pop singer but as a recording artist, she is clearly a country singer. Maybe if they focus their energy into turning her into a young Martina McBride they will have more success then if they try to turn her into Kelly Clarkson's spawn... She deserves much better than this."
1,horribleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,on the idol show diana was never that good but ok with a few singing lessons she could be better. but on this album even though i thought she could not sing on idol i would rather listen to idol instead of this cd. she should not be very proud of this. i dont know maybe it is just not my type of music . like the movie cases say TWO THUMBS DOWN (AND A LITTLE REMIX) she could do much better
3,Pretty good overall,"Not a bad first effort for the American Idol runner-up. As she matures, look for good things from her.Song breakdown:Cardboard castles-3/5Blue skies-3.5/5Emotional-4.5/5Then I woke up-3.5/5All I never wanted-4/5Go on and cry-3/5The difference in me-4/5Till you want me-3.5/5Dreams-3.5/5Boy like you-4/5Dream, dream, dream-3.5/5Don't cry out loud-4/5"
5,perfect album!,Cardboard Castles - 10/10Blue Skies - 9/10Emotional - 9/10Then I Woke Up - 8/10All I Never Wanted - 8/10Go on and cry - 11/10 ( WOW)Difference in Me - 8/10Till You Want Me - 10/10Dreams - 10/10(angelic)Boy Like You - 8/10(cute)Dream Dream Dream - 10/10(love this one)Don't Cry out loud - 10/10(best version i've heard)
5,Perfect!,"Diana DeGarmo has the voice of an angel, she is a very sweet girl. My daughters always tell me how they want to meet her and get her various merchandise. She sings well, and is much more than another Hillary Duff!"
4,Sneaks Up on YA,"I actually heard ""Emotional"", track #3 on Blue Skies"", first about 5 weeks ago as a World Premiere on Atlanta's WWW-Q 100.5 FM. I didn't dislike or like the song. One of those tracks that you wouldn't instantly turn from when it comes on the radio, but neither would you place it in your CD player. After a few random listens I found myself actually liking the track, and buying the CD when it was released. ""Emotional"" is a winner simply because it showcases DeGarmo's vocals with lyrics that go beyond the annoying AIDOL theme of ""I'm Me-Believe In ME"" etc(yeah we know get over it). Other standouts include ""Cardboard Castles"", ""Then I Woke Up"", and ""Difference In Me"". I have never been a veiwer of Americal Idol, but hands down to DeGarmo for showcasing a true star quality with musical talent - something, until now, only Kelly Clarkson had managed to achieve!"
4,Diana Reaches For The Stars,"Diana DeGarmo reached for the stars with her debut CD Blue Skies... and succeeds. Each song showcases Diana's voice the way it should be, pure and melodic. In a world where whispered, unintelligible words, marginal lyrics, and questionable ""melodies"", Diana stands above the crowd of female pop singers. She enunciates her words, stays with good, clean lyrics, and gives us notes only the best can sing. When the top names have faded to oblivion, Diana will still be singing to us all, for she has what they don't - real musical talent."
2,Not feeling this cd.,"I am giving this cd 2 stars for the 4 songs I could actually sit thru. I was not able to listen to the others because frankly, after hearing her screach and scream thru the first 4, well my ears hurt. I won't even discuss the flat off key notes that she hits in her lower register. I do agree with the person that said ""John Stevens was robbed."" I think Johnny Red will have a much better product and his sales will be better. As far as Diana goes.. she could always try to get on the tv show ""The Swan."" She has pagent experience so maybe her mommy could help her out."
1,Needs more work,"I listen to all CD's on Rhapsody before I actually purchase. Saves me a lot of money. This CD is not purchase worthy. In fact I'm scratching my head as to why they would put this out. It sounds like she has a cold on every song. Either that or I never noticed how ""nasal"" she was before.To those thinking of purchasing this CD I'd suggest you save your money. I liked Degarmo on AI. But they sure didn't do her any justice with this thing at all. I'd say give her a few more vocal lessons and let her grow up a bit and then shove her back in the studio and see what happens."
1,The Ditanic has sunk,"Let us have a moment of silence for Diana's passing music career.Seriously, I have heard howling dogs that sound better. And I agree with the poster that said she should lay off the burgers if she wants to at least try to model. Right now the only thing she could possibly model would be tarps."
1,A REAL WANNABE,This album does not do her voice good. She is just another Ashley Simpson faking it til she makes it. If the album is doing so well how come her ratings SUCKS!!! Her ratings on Amazon is 294 and I haven't seen or heard from her so what's really going on. I'm not going to waste the rest of my time going from the beginning to the end on which songs I like the best because it all SUCKS!! I hope she does better on her sophomore album because she really needs HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,There are No Words...,"This is a terrible cd. The songs sound the same. She sounds like she was talking through the songs. She is no Kelly Clarkson. Diana did good on AI (sometimes), but this is a headache to listen to. Save your money, buy some groceries..."
2,Good Try,I tried to give this cd a chance. i don't think it was as much as the singing as the bad lyrics. I think RCA didn't give this young lady much to work with. She sounds rushed and is singing loud as to gain power. She can sing no doubt. She has one great song which I will purchase the single Go On And Cry. It doesn't sound rushed and vocals are beautiful. The rest I don't know. In a few years I think she should come back with a new team and try again with better music. Her new single is ok Emotional not great She has Cardboard Castles It is actually better than Emotional. A good stocking stuffer for 10 to 15 yr old girls
1,Makes ME Cry Out Loud! :-(,"Ugh, this CD is horrible! :-( When I first watched Diana on American Idol I thought she was kinda good, so I went to go get her CD, and man do I regret it, I think I might even return it. The songs are to teeny-booper (more for ages 14 and under) and Diana tries to make her ""voice"" reach what it can not reach. I highly recommend NOT buying this CD, go and get Fantasia's Free Yourself, I voted for Diana, didn't really like Fantasia, but follow me when I say NOW Fantasia is better, she has the better CD! P.S. I GUESS I WASN'T THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN'T STAND DIANA'S VOICE, DIANA DIDN'T MAKE IT TO THE TOP 50 FOR HER FIRST WEEK!"
4,cracking debut,"How Old ?a really good first album, along the lines of other girlysingers but with one difference she has a voice and what a voice.The voice and some good songs makes for a cracking album."
4,When is her follow up CD coming out?,Diana was like 16 or 17 when this album was recorded and she did an amazing job! There are up-beat songs and slow ones too. I really enjoy this ablum and have listened to it many times. It's always uplifting. What an amazing talent. I am really wondering when her follow up album is going to come out. I know she is keeping herself busy playing Penny in Hairspray on Broadway. At any rate I will be buying her new CD once it is released. Hurry up!!
5,Great Album - Every Song Is Outstanding,"The ""Blue Skies"" Album by one of the best female recording artists in the music industry is terrific. The CD includes twelve outstanding songs all superbly vocalized by Diana DeGarmo.Highly Recommended!!! Don't miss It!!!There is one song I heard recently that I think could be a giant hit for Diana were she ever to record it. The song is ""Half Heaven - Half Heartache"" which originally was a hit for Gene Pitney who is in the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame. The song like ""Don't Cry Out Loud"" one of Diana's big hits requires a lot of high powered vocals which Diana can easily provide with her beautiful and powerful voice."
4,Really Good,"Okay my sister made me really mad when she told me that the critics in Entertainment Weekly gave this CD an F! I could not understand why because I really enjoyed it. Then again I really don't listen to critics and I still really like it. I was actually expecting more of a sound like Kelly's first album but was really pleased to have some edge to her sound. But listen to the sound clips on this site, because they give a good taste of the album. It is a really good CD, maybe not the best out there, but it is good and I suggest anyone to look into buying it."
3,Blue Skys.,"I liked Diana Degarmo on American Idol but who ever helped her with this CD did not do her any favors. Some of the songs were good, IE The Day The Circus Came To Town. Most of the songs were not good. She sings better then this album suggests that she does. If this is what future albums from her are going to be like she will not last long in the music industry."
1,Arghhhh,This is the worst American Idol CD yet and the worst from the recent wave of girl singers. There is a reason she didn't win and this proves it.
2,"Trouble in Blue Skies- Right voice, wrong style",Diana has a fantastic voice- it conveys emotion as well and is musically sound. Unfortunately it is framed by a pop-rock background. Sort of like taking an authentic Rembrandt and putting it in one of those plastic poster frames.Diana- Sing country. Sing broadway. But don't sing pop. A diamond needs to be in the light to shine.
3,I LOVED IT!!,But everything I love ends up being what everyone else hates. With the given cd sales I stand correct.
2,Good start...but,"In contrast to the comment above, I think this actually DOES sound like a typical teen pop album. Lindsey Lohan or the Lizzie McGuire actress could have done this.I think the amazon reviewer is spot on when she says that this album is analogous to DeGarmo trying on different outfits to see what suits her best. Country music might be the right fit (She does sound like Leann Rhimes)."
1,too mandy American Idols,"If only they would've stopped after the first American Idol was ""discovered."" Diana has a great voice, but all the company wants to do is make music that will get stuck in people's heads so that they purchas cd's and make more money."
1,OH MY :(,I was really hoping for better for Diana but this cd proves that she just isn't ready. Playing dress up and singing in the school play..Sure! But not a real CD.. not yet anyway. She needs to keep trying and keep working on her lower register and in time.. I hope she'll blossom. Just not yet. Sorry Di.
2,Dissappointed Fan,"I love Diana and has rooted for her all the way She can really sing. I am mad at Clive Davis, RCA, and 19E for not giving her better material and songs. They could have got good producers the way they did with Fantasia and Kelly. They threw her to the dogsThis cd is terrible. She will be back with a new record company and put out a new cd"
1,TERRIBLE,I can't believe she actually got a recording contract. What a flop this cd will be. The only thing it is good for is thrwing it on the ground to see how many times you can smash it before it breaks! I WANT A REFUND KMART!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Pitiful,Diana Degarmo makes The Spice Girls sound good! She needs to go get some voacl training and fast.
1,obviously very overrated by some fans..,"Diana was neglected by RCA...well that's what her fans said when Diana cannot sell more copies of her album than William Hung. It's not that RCA doesn't want to promote her, it's just.. this CD is full of bubblegum-pop crap! she can sing..yes, it's true, but the tracks on the CD except for Don't cry out loud doesn't show her range and uniqueness as an artist (well,..a singer). this kind of cd can be found everywhere! i will not advice any diana fans to buy fantasia's cd, because their style are just so different from each other. The people that like Diana surely like bubblegum pop / or pop...whatever, and the one's buying fantasia's are the ones that like rnb style of music.To sum up, this cd is not good at all and i just hope that she can do better next time (if she has the opportunity, knowing that this album flopped big time - sold less than justin guarini)"
1,DREADFUL,"I voted for Diana and was excited to get her CD but this is awful. It was so bad, I returned it to my store and demanded a refund. She needs to find her own identity- this copy-cat bubblegum music will get her nowhere- it is not acceptable. Next time, I hope she find a sense of style that fits her, and yes, I will buy it, and yes, if it is awful like this one, [...], but I will at least give her another chance, and listening to this monstrosity of sound, she may not deserve it."
1,Wake me when you're done,"I really dont get it, and from the sound of Diana Degarmo, I don't think she does either. I praise her for the desire to achieve at such a young age, but I don't understand why she's out there when there is so much more talent that deserved the shot. If she was gonna put a cd out, it could have at least been OK. It's not even passable. *thumbs down for this attempt*"
2,Wait for Voice to Mature,"I first saw Diana when she was a finalist on ""America's Most Talented Kids"". She can definitely sing but her voice and talent need time to mature. She goes for the glory notes just like a child does. she will be a ""better than good"" singer one of these days. her time is just not now.....the album is not very enjoyable in my opinion."
5,the true american idol,"this cd is really great. I was waiting for SO LONG for diana to release her first full cd after buying the single the day it came out. [...]Sorry bout that. Anyway, I think the best song on this cd is cardboard castles. Go to the Walmart Music Downloads on www.walmart.com to download it.Dreams and Don't Cry out Loud were on diana's single. They're great songs, but I don't think they should be on Blue Skies.Buy this cd--you won't regret it."
5,The album is WONDERFUL!,"This is a great alubum! The songs are all great, vocals and music are all spectacular! You can tell alot of hard work and dedication went into this album. Diana is truly an amazing singer, and a wonderful person. This is to be one of many albums from MS.DeGarmo!"
3,HAHAHAHAHAHAHA,"LMFAO OH Whitney what fool you are. How proposterous to say that Diana had better vocal control than Kelly. Kelly has the vocal control of Mariah and Celine an Christina. Kelly can hit power notes right off the bat that Diana couldn`t even DREAM of hitting. Its insane and ignorant to say that diana has better control than Kelly. I`m not kockin my girl diana, girl can BLOWWWW but no where near Kelly standard."
1,Very Sad,This cd and her new video for Emotional are quite sad. Shame on American Idol for allowing her to come in 2nd. Unrealistic expectations to think this girl could ever sell cd's.
1,Better Luck Next Time,"Diana's CD is boring and totally forgetable. All the songs sound the same with the noisy guitars in the background. The only good song is the remake of ""Don't Cry Outloud."" Diana has no pizzazz at all and that's why she didn't win American Idol. She would be more successful singing to a group of senior citizens at a nursing home."
1,Latoya and Jennifer were ROBBED!,There is no way that Diana could ever outsing the 2 that should have been runner up to Fantasia. Jennifer and Latoya were robbed by Diana. Diana screeches and screams and her bubbly personality is irritating and annoying. This cd is the worst thing I've ever heard and I am glad that I only listened to my friends copy and that I did NOT buy this crap.
1,don't cry out loud,"I'm sorry, but Diana gets one star for Don't Cry Out Loud and that's it. All the songs sound the same on this album. This is a waste of her talent.Diana, stop crying and start singing.It sounds too drab for my taste"
3,ok,"ok diana can sing but she does not put anything in her singing it's just forgetable.this album lacks her talent big time,i hope she has better songs on her next album,because this album us forgetable"
1,Blue skies? More like tornado weather!,"Take cover folks! It is gonna be a bad one!Seriously, this cd is terrible quality. Di's voice is shaky. What good is it to hit a glory note if everything else sounds like crap? Better luck next time!"
3,Not enough to reach beyond her AI fanbase.,"These songs remind me of a soundtrack music from a B teenage movie. Other than the two songs that's on the CD from her previous single, Emotional is the only other song that has any potential. Rest of the songs are below par and the rock pop production is very amatuerish. Diana reminds me of Hilary Duff with a better voice. She has talent and the potential, she just needs better songs and people behind her. RCA isn't a good label to be under considering what they did for another AI runner up and they also ran off Alicia Keys because they thought she didn't have the talent to make it. Remember Diana's only 17, she still has a lot of room to grow to become a bona fide artist."
5,Very cool album!!!,Way to go Diana DeGarmo! You're album is such a cool pop/rock mixture. I love it! Keep up your awesome singing.
5,DeGarmo is a young prodigy,"Lights Camera Action! Diana DeGarmo's here. This young pop princess is far from typical, ordinary, and bleek. Her smooth, razzy type voice is ideal for Pop/AC radio. DeGarmo has something more though, this being a voice that is out of this world, poise and wisdom beyond her years, and an incredible spirit and individuality. I hope she goes far"
5,Almost a Year and Still Appealing,"It's been almost a year since I first bought Diana DeGarmo's ""Blue Skies"". Let me tell you that even now I still cannot put it down.I'm not going to go through all the tracks and rate them tediously, but this album is for people who are fans of Heart and other girl rockers. It is not what you would expect from a typical American Idol that is all pop-py and commercial like this year's winner, Carrie Underwood. In fact, I believe the reason this didn't sell was because there was no promotion and it wasn't made pop. Simple.I find myself ignoring the songs ""Dreams"" and ""Don't Cry Out Loud"" because we're all sick of 'em by now. At least they didn't put ""I Believe"" from her single there because then it would be too much like her single and less new songs.This album was way underrated. I really do reccomend you buying it. It still is getting my money's worth."
2,They Did Diana Wrong,"This is just a waste of good talent. All of the songs except ""Go on and Cry"" and ""Don't Cry Out Loud"" sound too much alike. I agree with a lot of the posters on here who say this was a rushed job and that is not fair to Diana. I say to Diana, do what you have to do until your contract is up, and the RUN. ""Go On and Cry"" could be a great single. That would redeem some of this tragedy. None of this is Diana's fault. There are people out there who can really help her. Hopefully, they will come forward when this contract ends. I feel so bad for her. There are people who like the album. I guess that's a help. I'm looking for much better things to happen for Diana."
1,Couldn't Listen Through The Whole CD,"I really thought Diana DeGarmo showed promise on American Idol, but this CD was misguided effort at best. This is a real shame because Diana looks like a real talented and nice girl. The lyrics are hackneyed and cringe worthy at times. She should have taken more control of the production. Her voice is okay and with better songs, this CD would have made for nice easy listening pop."
2,"Nice, But Utterly Forgettable...","Don't get me wrong, I think Diana DeGarmo is a great singer. Unfortunately, this CD will never prove that to ANYBODY. This has to be some of the most tepid, unoriginal fluff I've ever heard. These songs were definitely pulled from the bottom drawer.Even the most recognizable, ""Don't Cry Out Loud"", is a prime example of why certain songs just don't need to be remade.This sounds like a product that was rushed out to capitalize on her American Idol-spawned fifteen minutes of fame. Hopefully, she can regroup for the second outing with better material (not to mention an arranger who will actually work in her key!).Conclusion: Nice try, but ultimately misfiring...."
5,Good MLT study book,"Great book, lovely set up too the point covers a lot of ground and is pratical and necessary too pass that ASCP exam."
3,Grand Canyon DVD,The DVD arrived on time. I started out looking at the DVD but I got a little board with the first part of it.I'll try watching it again and give it another chance.
4,Good Celtic music,"For the most part I liked this CD, but I almost wouldn't consider this a Holiday CD. The music was soothing & more like just regular Celtic music. It did have Altan & David Arkenstone on it, which is a major plus. I always like these artists."
3,Good Computer but not great,"When I first took home the HP Media center it worked great. It was fast and options seemed unlimited...or so I thought. I have had this computer for all of a month and am experiencing problems that the sales associate promised I would not have. First off, my DVD/CD-ROM drive broke after the second week be fore I even had a chance to play a single DVD on it. Second when I did get it replaced...(After sending it in to HP)Every DVD I attempted to play on it caused the computer to stall and freeze and this was just 4 weeks after taking it out of the box! But I give this computer 3 stars because if you have DSL service this computer can really shine. It come with a remote...which I think is cool, the graphics on the desktop are great... and it really is fast..CD ROM aside of course. But I warn...if you want a really reliable long lasting computer you may want to look eles where."
1,Garbage!!!,"I purchased this toy for my 3yr old twins for Christmas, as an accessory to the kitchen set Santa brought. My girls were super excited to have a mixer like mommy, so they could bake their cakes and cupcakes. I put batteries into this toy and the beaters spin (safety feature worked fine), however they dont stop spinning!!! There are buttons on the mixer for the beater release and I assumed to turn the product off, but when I tried to push the button to turn it off it fell apart. The button collapsed into the mixer and the baeters Never stopped spinning!!! What a waste of money for the price paid!!! If it werent christmas and the box wasnt torn into I would have returned immediately for full refund, but unfortunetly I have to eat the cost of this. My kids were so disappointed, as was I that this toy was such a total piece of JUNK!!!! This toy got two stars because for the 45 seconds my kids played with it, they had fun!"
3,"If you're a skeptic, this is an excellent book!","The book presents an excellent historical research about what's behind the arrival of keynesian economics and it's connection with fabian socialism, but professor Dobbs loses his reason when he attempts to personally discredit J.M. Keynes and his peers, based on his own outdated bigotry and christian morality. It's a book worth reading - especially if you plan to deepen your investigation going to the source material - but, as usual, you have to be skeptical."
1,NO age groups listed!,"Here I am trying to make up lesson plans and activity plans for various age groups of children. I got this book in the hopes that it would be filled with activity plans.......which it is.......BUT..........there are no ages listed on any of the activities! You have to literally GUESS at what age group every single activity plan in this book is pertaining to. Other books I've seen list the activity and what age group it is appropriate for.....this book does not.I do like that it answers basic questions such as ""What do I need"" = Materials.....""Why do I have children do this?"" = Developmental goals.......""What do I do?"" = Procedures.Too bad it's not more helpful in listing the ages.This book is virtually useless to me."
5,This is a nicely built product!,This F-1053 Home Trainer by The Step is just what I need to do my step aerobic at home. It is small enough for me to slide it underneath my family room cocktail table when I don't need it. The surface is big enough for me to do my step aerobic at home. It is very sturdy and yet at an affordable price. The Step really knows how to make a step platform. I really love it... I'm glad I made the decision to purchase this product.
3,OK,This product is OK. It is not quite as big as I expected it to be. It does serve its purpose and I can use it easily in a small space. You just have to be careful and watch where you step. If you are used to using the bigger gym size steps it is easy to miss the step.
4,A fine step,"This is not the highest quality step but it works fine for me. I like the smaller size. It's easy to store but not so small that I feel unstable. The DVD that comes with it is also great for beginning or intermediate steppers. It feels a little cheap compared to gym steps but, considering the price, I am happy with it."
3,Step F1053 home trainer,"Good stepper for the money-I would like a stepper a little longer for some of us that are taller and when doing certain steps, you feel you may not have enough room. Thought it would be wobbly since the stps do not lock in, but no problem thus far."
3,Compact Enough,"This step is the only one that would fit under my couch for storage in my apartment. If storage is an issue for you, then this is the step to get. It is not the sturdiest of the steps out there though. It feels like it ""bows"" a bit in the middle. I have another step that is Rock-Solid sturdy and I don't weigh that much either (130lbs), so if you are a bigger person, you might want to consider that."
3,Too small,If you are petite and have a small shoe size then this step works. For those of us with longer feet this platform is too small which makes it very difficult to work out because it is difficult to position your feet safely. The exercise video is great though
3,great stepper but dvd don't work,I just received the step home trainer. Stepper works great but the DVD dosen't work at all. I guess that's what you get when you want something for a cheap price.
4,good product,"it is light weight but steady, good size, nice quality. especially if you are not a very tall person, this will be just right one for you. the only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is: I wish the main board and two legs could be somehow attached together, so when you move them around in the house, it is one piece, not three."
3,Poor print quality,"I was personally a little disappointed with some aspects of this book. While the content is good, and relatively well-written, the print quality and paper used is very poor indeed. There is so much show-through on some pages that it makes reading the code very difficult as you can see the code on the reverse page too.As, like many developers, I run sites on servers running PHP 4, many of the examples don't work as they're PHP 5 specific. Not unsurprising I suppose, but it would still be beneficial to have stated this in the title."
4,Recommended,"AJAX and PHP: Building Responsive Web Applications is a well structured book with a clear layout. The design isn't extremely stylish but as with most programming books it is very functional. The only small remark is that it would have helped if the code blocks would have a different background or marking to separate them from the text to allow a user to quickly scan over what he is about to do before entering the actual code itself. This book covers the necessary theory but it's main focus is on building AJAX applications that use PHP, XML, JavaScript and MySQL. All in all I recommend this book to anyone who wants to build applications with AJAX and PHP."
2,good primer but not much meat,It was easy to follow the first few chapters then they expect you to already know several other subjects before you can even understand the rest. I used [...] tutorials to get through the stuff that wasn't covered. Even after that it really didn't dig deep enough into fancy effects associated with AJAX.
4,"""Come one, Come all!""","Here's a delightful and informative reference written in a breezy style and enhanced by a keen insight into popular culture and entertainment.A terrific historical overview of a forgotten genre of education and entertainment, the book has amazing parallels to today's museum extravaganzas - and the author has captured a period and its personalities with aplomb.A must read for lovers of pop culture, oddities, museums and turn of the century personalities."
4,A great reminder of what I'd already learned...,"""Just Do This Stuff"" is a great inspiration. Through a friendly and fun style, Larry reminded me of so many basic yet important things. Being so hurried -- its all too easy to forget. Luckily its a short and easy read and makes a great gift or porcelain pedestal reader!"
5,To the point reminders,I have enjoyed this little book several times. I am a big fan and have gone to his seminars and each time walk away with a better outlook. This book does the same. To the point inspirations.
5,Great American Pastels Grey set,"any pastel artist who has tried Great American pastels knows they are wonderful and soft. The sticks are square so they do have edges for lines, and they do not crumble. The grey set is a wonderful set to have when you are working on intense clouds or for shadows. As their name would imply, this is a genuine American made product and top notch quality. The company serves pastel artists well and appreciates feedback on their products."
4,excellent and a half,"This time around I'll forget my usual period context, and say Edip Akbayuram was on the Turkish psych scene around the turn of the 1960s into the 1970s.What I won't forget is the strength of this album, both in its cohesion and its diversity. That's a little abstract, isn't it: but the ethnic tracks, funky rhythms, punchy stops and overall fantastic playing make this music rocking, danceable, and an incredibly gut shaking experience. Hear it, and no explanation required.I don't know why: because I am a bass player, because the band here was trying to up bottom on primitive sound, (I mean the audio, not the music) if this area had limited access to music and were just coping McCartney, or WHAT?But these non-Western recordings from this period always have the most incredible bass work. Sliding, popping, funky,. agile, just beautiful four string work.Any thoughts on this? Comment"
3,"A book about, not of, sailors","This book is not a narrative. IT is written in a strained third person perspective., The author writes about how bygone sailors rigged their boats, how they differed from each other, etc. Not a guide book, a story, an instructional piece- I don't know how to classify this book. IT is like overhearing a conversation and never getting to dig into what is being said. I love sailing books but this one is a disappointment."
3,I'll have to agree with Kurt A. Johnson,"I think he hit the mark so really there is no reason for me to disassemble and debunk Evit Kejbo Nosrep arguments. Ask some hard questions next time. The arguments would've been good, but sadly they fall flat when one looks at historical evidence."
3,Too Brief,"Interesting premise. The book takes a tolernat attitude while it attmepts to go through parts of the scrptures of the Jews, Chrisntians, and Muslims. Still, it reads almost like a cliffs notes. For $12.99 and a few hours of your time, it might be worht it, but it will probably leave you thirsting for some more content."
1,Don't buy this book,"I was VERY disapointed with this book.I expected interesting facts about Saudi Arabia and life there, and all I got was what and when the author smoked and drank, and who she slept with. Even these facts aren't written in an interesting or funny style, more like a list of men and places she went to.I'm very sorry that Amazon sells (and even can recommend) such a book."
3,"Review of ""Single in Saudi""","This book was a self-serving account of one woman's journey to The Kingdom. I was hoping to get more of an account of healthcare and cultural aspects of Saudi. Instead the author (who obviously thinks very highly of herself) goes on and on about how every guy she meets falls in love with her and how she can't resist the temptation to sleep with them. All the men are handsome to her and all of them are ""passionate"" lovers. By 2/3 of the way into the book, I found it difficult to keep track of who she was sleeping with in whatever chapter I was reading. I found it hilarious how she judged the character Johnnie for her lifestyle when the author had revealed she has little moral fiber of her own."
5,To reader from Wa.,"There are those who write. Those that can't criticize. Perhaps the reader is jealous of Genia as she told her story as she lived it. Few women have had the adventures that Genia had. Perhaps she is not Danielle Steel with the help of editors who strip her story to fluff, but her story is real and true. Genia's story is truly her experience-if it is a testimony to her self-certeredness(not selfcerterness) as written by reader from Washington, the reader should just enjoy the story and not be over critical as Genia wrote of her true life in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."
3,"Interesting - but more on a ""fiction level""","I have been in KSA (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) and had hoped to read about a similar experience by another american woman. As a muslim and probably a bit more serious person, I was s a bit shocked at what the author wrote. There is an old saying ""One who looks for trouble will surely find it."" Genia definitely went out of her way to find ""trouble."" Her behaviour (heavy drinking, drug use, flirting, casual sex) as well as her less conservative (for arab standards) dress probably was like a green-light for those saudi men that Genia mentiones in the book. --- Genia's story, unfortunately does not mention many of the decent Saudis, that would have never behaved so debauched. --In all, I felt like the book was written more like a Jackie Collins novel, then an account of an american nurse's 2 year-stay in the Kingdom. Perhaps, had it been different, the book (and the story) would have been less interesting for western readers."
1,Incorrect English is very distracting.,"I had trouble following the story due to poor sentence construction and mis-spelled words. The last time I checked there was no such word as noone and it was used numerous times throughout the book. I have read many interesting books about Saudi, especially Jean Sasson's ""Princess"" series, but ""Single In Saudi"" was more about her sex life than about the lifestyles of Saudi. Very disapointing book but would have been slightly better if a proofreader had been used."
4,Red letter bible study,Using for a small group bible study and it is easy to use. We like the daily ideas to follow. Lessons are short
5,Better Houseware Item 1419 Corner Storage Rack,"I really like this rack, and it fits very well on my counter. It holds quite a few dishes, which is just what I wanted."
5,My favorite!,The only cologne I use since it is great on me & I get compliments all the time from people. Also doesn't seem to activate anyone's allergies.The seller was very fast shipping it to me.fdipasq
1,terrible service,Purchased a Tracfone for my son for Christmas. The initial set-up took 6 days (that should have been my first clue). I've added minutes twice since then & both times have been filled with frustration. Their system has been down repeatedly. This last (and final) addition they charged my credit card twice. I was on the phone for over 90 minutes trying to get it resolved. No supervisor was available. Total headache. I'm calling Go Phone...it can't be worse than this!
5,It's great!,"I have TracFone service as well as a MagicJack and it's the best phone service I have ever had in my 75 years! I use both and am very happy with the services. I add minutes on line with no problems for the TracFone, and if I have a perceived problem with MagicJack I go to their website and READ the questions and answers that fit my needs. I was paying 55.00 a month just to have a phone sit in my house, plus 7 cents a minute for long distance. I now buy minutes from TracFone when I need them--I have a double minute card--and I prepaid MagicJack until 20013 at like about 60.00 for the five years. I feel totally liberated with the phone services I now have and hated every month that the regular phone bill came in!"
4,"For the money, Tracfone is a great deal","I have used a Tracfone for three years now and they work very well. Often in places other phones don't have service; Tracfone does. I am now on my third phone and I only experienced a little bit of a problem getting my minutes switched over this last time. However, after waiting almost three days for them to do it; I got online and did it myself. If you can follow directions online, you can usually solve any problems there. I love my Tracfone. Al Phelps El Paso, Texas"
5,"""Zen and the Ways of Rivers""","Thoughtful and well-researched, and a total pleasure to read. This book is a combination of ""Blue Highways"" and ""Travels with Charley"" - a wonderful travelogue of life along backroads (and back rivers!) America. But more importantly - I learned an amazing amount about rivers and water management. The author's obvious knowledge of water systems is presented easily and effectively.Now, living next to the Rio Grande, or visiting New Orleans, I have a much better understanding of how wildlife (and people) are affected by these rivers. If you enjoy reading about real people, their lives (and their rivers), and like to learn a bit at the same time, I highly recommend this book. A great alternative read in these days of ""Lewis and Clark remembered""."
3,Just Okay,"I had seen information regarding the book and the author. I was eager to read the story. I found it a little disappointing after the hype. The initial story line is sweet but it drags as one gets into the book. I think the author maybe inexperienced. However, I hope she continues to write. We all get better with practice!"
1,Worst purchase ever!,This is the worst purchase ever from Amazon resources. Terrible condition. Not true to what was advertized! This was supposed to be a wedding gift for one of my daughters. I love this book and it is so hard to find. But this is the worst copy ever. I am so disappointed! She was married March 5th. I have yet to get her something as I am so upset about this book and really wanted to share it with her and her new husband.
3,Hollow egg okay,"I bought this last year for $85.00 for my trying to upgrade my paperweight collection. I'll stick to real paperweights as this just didn't have the pizzazz I'd hoped for, even at this price."
1,Difficult to read and little information.,"This book has only about eighty pages of actual text. It was written under Communist rule and reflects a Marxist view of history. Unfortunately for most scholars it was written for Hungarians who already have considerable knowledge of their own history and geography. The style is that of a dissertation rather than a history book. So much opposing evidence is presented with only the author's opinion to base judgement on. But the biggest problem is that the translator was not an English speaker. Long, circuitous (or as this writer would say, ""circumstantial"") sentences often end up with no grammatical sense. Lacking words he sometimes makes them up, e.g. ""planful."" I struggled all the way through and found two or three pieces of information pertinent to my research, but on the whole I was very disappointed."
4,Me 109 and P-40 lovers will love this book!,"Format is 33 stories, each with a pilot bio and aircraft spec block and a few pictures of the pilot and aircraft. Beware 11 of the pilots are either flying P-40s or 109s so if you hate these planes look elsewhere. There are 4 jet stories, 2 Israeli: F-4 and Nesher, and 2 F-86 stories (USAF); 12 WW1 stories, with the remainder going to WW2 including ONLY 1 Soviet VVS story on Kozhedub's White 27 (I want more!). Overall as a used book it is great and the pilot biography and aircraft specs are laid out well. (But really how many times do we need the specs reiterated on a P-40 or 109!!!- wasted space in my estimation!) I got it cheap and I like it so recommend it on those grounds. Full page paintings of the aircraft with no crap printed on them is most excellent."
4,Excellent book on masculinity,"For those who are open to how Christ can heal the deepest recesses of what is means to be a man, I wholeheartedly recommend this book. Payne does not advocate putting women down to pick men up. I think it's unfortunate that others have characterized Leanne Payne as misogynist. Anyone who has heard her lecture on misogyny or seen her in person knows that is simply not true, unless one characterizes all who disagree with their view as misogynist."
4,"A convincing book, uncovering causes of much human neurosis.","Leanne Payne's book penetrates the causes of much observable neurosis. She relates the roots of gender confusion to a convincing Christian doctrine of Creation, and holds out hope for restoration in the Christian doctrine of Atonement. I thought this was true after I'd read the book. I was fully convinced when I read the first three reviews on the Amazon page. I hope the identity-threatened reviewers are seeing their shrinks regularly. We should pray for them."
2,Not very good...,"I really wanted to give this book a 2 and 1/2 stars. A quater of this book was really good. The rest was dull, confusing and not well written."
1,Literary Dung,"There's only one thing to do when someone is blowing piffle chunks: Hold your nose & get out of the way! ""Leanne"" would like to take us back to the caves (preferably being pulled by our hair). Sorry, Dudette, I ain't going!"
4,"Funny, clever, and engaging","If ""Jaws"" was not your cup of tea (and it isn't mine), try a taste of this. Delightful!"
2,PLEASE PETER....NO POLITICS,I TOO READ THIS (OR TRIED TO) READ THIS BOOK ABOUT 14 YEARS AGO ( WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT)IT WASN'T TOTALLY BAD I JUST RESPECT BENCHLEY'S WRITING ABOUT MARINE AND AQUATIC THRILLERS. THE ONLY REASON I BOUGHT THE BOOK WAS BECAUSE I FIGURED IF PETER WROTE IT EVEN THOUGH IT'S POLITICAL IT'S GOT TO BE GOOD. HOW WRONG I WAS.
3,Not suitable for running,"I bought this hydration unit for long runs (10-22 miles) so I wouldn't have to stop for water. While the unit holds a lot of water which is a benefit, I think it works against it also shifts during the run regardless of how much I adjusted or tightened the straps. I literally had scrapes on my shoulders after my runs.The unit may be better suited for biking where there is less upper body movement.Evan Glueck"
3,review,"This book was coming alive for me, but kept falling apart so I had to return it. I am looking for another one. It was very inspirational telling me about many other people who have prodigals in their lives and how to have hope that they will change."
5,praying the prodicals home,This book has been an amazing help to me in praying for my childrens return to the Lord and the others salvation. It has equipped me w/the Word to apply to all these situations and the power of these testimonies as a weapon is more profound than I can express.
3,"This is NOT for chairs, as the picture, AND the description seems to make it sound like","This is for two pieces of metal, and a couple of scews. This is NOT for the chair(s).The picture is of the chairs. The description ""Fully upholstered fan-style back. Black tubular steel frame. Chairs stack up to five high. Back: 21-1/4w x 16-1/4h.

1,HON4069T pagoda Stacking Chairs (hardware),Ad is VERY tricky to understand. IT IS NOT CHAIRS BUT HARDWARE TO MAKE CHAIRS STACK. (I THINK)Should NOT be listed under stacking chair catagory!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Item did not fit my 1993 Accord Sedan,"The side piece to fit the hose in my car was a different diameter. Not sure of my model; it's a sedan with cloth seats, sunroof, automatic window and mirror adjustment."
4,Surprisingly Good!,"These movies not only teach kids some classic stories and classical music, the female characters are actually very strong role models for young girls...unlike many ""princess"" movies out there. They are fun for old and young, promoting interest in ballet and classical music."
4,the sharpest tool in the box,a few good and a few dicey tunes had left my side walls pretty well flush with the edges. this was surprisingly horrible to ski on. its amazing that shaving a few mills of plastic off could make such a huge difference but that it did. the negligible instructional material that came meant for trial and error so maybe practice on an older pair of skis before you go live on your best set.
1,adjustible recliner strathwood deluxe,the recliner was shipped in a used and broken condition. we could not even open it. in addition it was so heavy it could not be moved around easily.it was so bulky it could not be taken to a park or beach. it was rhe worst recliner i have ever seen.
3,Strathwood Anti-Gravity Chair,"We have purchased these chairs in the past at a neighboorhood store. The chairs we ordered on line were just what we wanted, the right fabric, locking features, extremely comfortable, but they were so poorly packed... no packing materials at all in the box,and the boxes were delivered opened. Needless to say the frames were bent and we had to return them. We are having trouble being without new ones...the manufacturer must find a better way to ship these items."
3,"One was good, One was not","We received these chairs in different shipments. One was in good condition and worked great, the other was scratched up a little and off kilter when set-up. We kept them both, but only because Grandma died and we needed to get on the road, but we thought about shipping the one back--what a hassle. Now that we used them both, they are fine. We pretty much got what we paid for...."
2,Not for petites!,"The chair is indeed light wieght and seems to be very durable and weather resistant. Althought it's very light for its size, I wouldn't say it is portable. In fact, it's quite bulky and difficult to carry around. BUT I have to admit it is very comfy --as advertised. However, It's not made for petites! I am 5 feet tall and cannot come back to sitting position without help. You are supposed to use the bar at the bottom of the chair to help yourself by pushing it when you want to come from horizontal position to sitting position but I don't reach the bar so I cannot use it. I need to use my husband's help instead. If you're short like me and still decide to purchase this chair, make sure you're not alone when you recline in it or you may find yourself resting in your chair for days until help comes to rescue you."
2,Not as comfy as hoped,"This chair is really not as cushy and relaxing as a thickly padded lounger. The anti-gravity benefit doesn't compensate for that to me. It just feels like I am sitting in a chair with my feet up. The seat material is slick/taut/stiff. It weighs as much as any other similar lounger and the hard plastic handles bug me. The sliding adjustment requires some effort, and fingers can get caught badly in/around the locking loops. The chair feels narrow - not flimsy though. It's not badly constructed, but it just doesn't ring my bell."
2,Mediocre at best.,"I ordered two chairs and was pleased to receive the chairs within 5 days of ordering. But that's where it ends. One chair arrived in an open box and was severely damaged. I was also disappointed with the quality of the chairs. They are of mediocre quality and the frame could be sturdier. You get what you pay for and nothing more--in my case, less. Making the return proved to be a major headache. Amazon outsources their Customer Service Center to a country in southeast Asia. Although the representatives were pleasant enough folks, the language barrier made communication difficult and frustrating."
1,strathwood junk,"I ordered two strathwood deluxe anti-gravity chairs. Both chairs were garbage. They din't sit straight, had scratches on them and parts missing. The packaging was terrible. I wouldn't recommend these chairs to anyone."
3,Recliner,"This recliner is very comfortable. It is lightweight, and attractive on our patio. There are a couple of things that I was disappointed about: first, it is slightly tricky to use it. You have to be sitting in exactly the right spot to make it recline. And second, there does not seem to be any way to have your legs up without the top half also reclining. I like to sit up and read a magazine, with my feet up...but this chair doesn't let me do that. You are either sitting, or lying down...nothing else seems possible. But, those two positions are very comfortable."
5,Sage Pages,"I'm a student of Karl's, so I may be biased, but it was through this book that I discovered Karl and decided to seek his teaching. The book is full of expert, dynamic, energetic, and fun figure drawings, peppered throughout with little gems of wisdom. I'd absolutely recommend it for anyone, but especially fellow artists looking for clues and inspiration to help them along their path."
5,The Best of Gnass..until the next book!!!,"I have a little insight into the creation of this work, having lived as the artist's partner for fourteen years, including the three year period in which SPIRIT OF THE POSE was created. Karl poured every drop of himself into the design and content of this work. For every sketch included, dozens equally as beautiful were put aside, hopefully, for the next publication. His words come not only from his heart and mind, but from careful study of himself as a man, and an artist. I can't remember how many times complete strangers to me, students of Karl's, would tell me how his teachings transformed not only their art, but their lives. This book is not to be flipped through on a coffee table. Use it to gaze into your own world of potential. And look for his next book in 2007!!"
5,Blinking with Fists,"I support everything that Billy Corgan does. I think it is wonderful for him to experiment with other artistic forms, and I will enjoy this book thoroughly. He's a very intelligent, insightful man, and I will always be anticipating anything he can conjure up. Thanks, Billy."
3,How Shall I Say This,"It's painful to say anything less than glowing things about this book, since I'm a major fan of the music Corgan and the other members of Smashing Pumpkins released, but I always also knew that when you got right down to it, much of what sounded so great as part of a song, made little real sense when read devoid of music. (For instance, ""1979"" one of the finest songs of the 90's, what do those words truly mean if you analyze them?) That's most of the problem here. I kept thinking how set to music much of Corgan's free verse would have taken wing, but on its own...it was lacking: even empty. There are some good pieces here in Blinking with Fists but I hope Billy concentrates more on music in the future, since that's where his talent--genius I'll go so far as to say--really lies. Sorry, Billy."
2,Corgan finally disappoints,"A long-time fan of all of Corgan's endeavors, I have looked forward with great anticipation to this poetry book. After receiving it and devoting a full day to assimilating it, I have come to the conclusion that he needs to stick with his day job. I personally could have chosen 128 words from the dictionary and titled them ""bunch of words."" But could I have had it published? No, I don't think so. In spite of what I've seen from other reviewers, I do not feel that these poems relayed the imagination and the color that is so rampant in Corgan's music. So Billy, I love you, but stick with your day job."
1,HA!,"This is some of the goofiest writing I've ever read . Talk about inarticulately self indulgent. But it was awesome. My wife and I would read poems out loud to each other and laughed our heads off. It was so bad, it was totally great. Amazing. Not sure to give it one or five stars. It may be the funniest book I've ever read."
3,Interesting Turn for Corgan,"Billy Corgan's poetry is full of imagery and imagination, but in the end, I don't think it would have gotten a second look if it wasn't coming from a multiplatinum musician. Some of the poems are really good from start to finish; tieing in themes and images for nice morsels of creativity. But when Corgan tries to go too far, encompass to many things, or use too many flowery words ""A Twixt The Twine"" the poetry just seems dull and cliche, like a Creative Writing 2 student who smoked too much pot before class.So whereas the poetry is hit or miss, it is still interesting to have a poetry book by Corgan. I look forward to a novel if he publishes one."
4,Blinking With Fists - Billy Corgan,"Picked up this collection of poetry entitled ""blinking with fists"" from the local bookstore without realizing at first who the writer was. It was like most times when I pick up a book whether of poetry or a novel, that being the content that I browsed through. Thought the two poems I read there standing in the aisle where something of interest that I bought it.In just a few pages I found myself connected to the man who founded the Smashing Pumpkins. Connected to the words of his poetry and the struggles I could feel through those words.Opening the book is the poem ""The Poetry of My Heart"" which sets the stage for the remaining pieces. The collection is full of looks within him and like many writers/musicians, we write these things down to purge the soul somehow.A book worth looking at."
2,Maybe I'm missing something,"I loved the Pumpkins. I also know that great poems are few and far between. I think I got frustrated trying to find meaning that only the soul writting it could understand. Now don't get me wrong, there is some substance here (the box and the warmth of morning)but most of it is just wandering thought. The only thing I might add, is I think that I would buy Corgan's second attempt."
5,O'Boy...O'Boy,"This is one of the best, by the most prolific singer, songwriter and musician in bluegrass and other gendres. Teamed with Tim is Mark,one of the most talented bass players(though not alone the best player), who plays banjo & cloggs...while playing his big ol' bass & Scott, who is just plain awesome when he flat picks! This recording is a treat...one of the best I've heard in a long time.Tim has written some of bluegrass (& countries) greatest songs, and no one plays a bouzouki quite as well. This of course, says his mandolin playing is less...but that would be wrong to assume. The licks this man performs are out of this world and deserving of a much larger audience.If it is great down home picking and singing you like, this is one buy you won't regret. I would recommend this one to anyone who appreciates pure talent and listening to fun music, STRONGLY!"
4,good book,I was preparing for GMAT and was very in Reading Comprehension. This book was helful to me especially the LSAT passages which were difficult compared to GMAT passages. explanations were good.
5,Beautiful!,"For many people looking for something other than HK action movies, this one's for you. Especially if you enjoy movies like ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""Sleepless in Seattle"", you will enjoy ""and i hate you so"".Zhang hosts a top rated radio program that offers advice regarding love affairs. He starts a love-war relationship with Wu, a columnist, when she hears him gossiping on her love life! Outraged, Wu begins to take revenge by writing against his program. This all-out fight caught the imagination of the public. Then the two protagonists find themselves attracted to each other but how are they going to tell each other?The film's highlight is the music used. Sets up beautiful ambience that I love.The quality of the DVD is very well done. Dialogue audio is nicely done. Video is nice as well. The music really captures the beauty of this film as well.All in all an awesome romantic film of 2000. The other being ""Needing You"". Highly recommended!"
5,Love,I loved this movie. This was the first movie of this type that I watchedand I found myself watching it over and over again.
5,samantha west,"I'm new to chess and have reviewed several books and I found ""Secrets of the Russian Chess Masters"" to be the best for a beginner.Lev Alburt and Larry Parr have written a primer to chess that's easy to follow and the chessersize examples have helped me to apply the lessons to classic chess competitions. I'm amazed at my progress and enjoy leaning and applying the ""tricks"" advanced players have used in previous tournaments.This book is a must read for all new chess players."
2,Bed board,"I have to say I give 5 stars to the shipping and delivery. It was quick, great, surprised me how quickly I got the board.I was dissapointed by the quality of the product, it is blue cardboard with blue tape. I ordered, a while ago, one for the full size sofa bed. I expected similar quality. I feel I could have made it myself and save me some money."
2,Nothing but cardboard!,"While I am giving this two stars, it really should be one. 2 stars is only because it does the job for the immediate need we had, but it is very poor quality. As it is made of just compacted cardboard, as soon as it was unfolded, the folded seems began to crack. This will NOT hold up to continuous use and suspect it will have to be discarded after the 5th time of using.If you are looking for something that you will be able to use over and over, I would suggest finding something of a more durable material that is intended for long-time use."
3,It works for me,"I was looking for a sturdy board to place between my slatted bed frame and my air bed. I would like to have seen the dimensions and ordering recommendations before I ordered. I am ordering a second 30"" wide board to accommodate my queen-size mattress."
3,"Great music, not so great compilation","A Fine, Fine Day is a ""best of"" collection of sorts for Tony Carey, the singer, guitarist, keyboardist formerly of Planet P Project and Rainbow. I say ""of sorts"" because this is an odd collection of songs. It basically collects 9 of the 11 songs on Carey's 1984 album Some Tough City and 7 of 10 songs from 1985's Blue Highway. I get that A Fine, Fine Day was released back in 1997 and there's a more comprehensive anthology available now, but this release just doesn't make a lot of sense.I suppose A Fine, Fine Day is a nice way to get acquainted with Carey's early solo material, but at this point it's cheaper just to buy the reissues ofSome Tough CityandBlue Highway. If you want a more thorough overview of Carey's solo career,A Lonely Life: The Anthologyis a much better choice."
3,"Thesis- Decent, but could have been better.....","Ambassador was the first album I got from Cross Movement, and in many ways this artist introduced me to Christian rap. I loved his first CD, Christology, for its message and great variety of beats. Yet, this timeI didn't feel that in his latest album. As one reviewer said, too many of his songs are very upbeat and sound similar. The beats lack variety and seems a little uninspired. In my opinion, they actually took away from his lyrics and at times message. I give him credit for serving the Lord, but not much credit for a lesser album.I still collect the Cross Movement albums for their wonderful message of God. But right now, my favorite is Lacrae...that guy has crazy lyrics, beats, and a powerful annoiting of God.. Maybe Ambassador will be my favorite again, but not this time."
3,Ok Rap album,I must say that I'm not so impressed by this album.This is better then Phanatics album but not as good as Flame's album.The Beats are sometimes very good and sometimes boring.There are some very good song in this album like a song for you and crown him.His last album Christology is better by my opinion.There is more agressivitity and better beats.
1,Don't waste you money : (,His flow is tired... and I would have to agree with the post below me Da Truth is the go to guy on cross movement. He has a real message..Ambassador is to busy sticking up for Hip Hop lateley to even stick up for Christ. The cd is a dissapointment... he does the same type of flow on all his songs and to make matters worse it is not a good flow. I am a fan of christian rap but it has to be GOOD christian rap. I'm kind of nervous to try out lecrae now because crossmovement promised that Ambassador was all that... we will see.
4,Gotta give it up...,"I was impressed with this. Everyone knows Christology was classic, and everybody knows Ambassador has laid down hot joints on the other CM albums. I think this was a really good follow-up. Off top, the production on this album is better than any of the CM albums I've heard, which is important to someone from the east coast who think that the beat and flow go hand in hand. Secondly, Ambassador's flow is perfect for the message, because its clear, witty and you always get the point in his songs. My favorites are ""Get Ya Open,"" ""Feels good"" and ""Body Talk."" Lyrically and flow-wise, I think Ambassador and Phanatik bring it the best. And of course, the message is the main key. Like Phanatik said on Heaven's Mentality, ""the khakis, suits and boots are optional, as long as the disagreement is nothing doctrinal."" One."
5,amazing content,i loved this album some christian rapper you can hardly tell that their christians but this album is all that and then some i love it . something i can listen to without the fear of hearing something over the top . if you want to listen to a great music as well as a great lyrics this is the album for you.
3,It does not hold DVD cases.,"I just received my Game System Organizer. Since it is under the heading of Playstation 2 one would think that it will hold DVD cases, either movies or Playstation 2. It does not. It only holds standard CD jewel cases and has inserts for N-...-4 and Genesis cartridges. I kept mine ... I decided to use it for my PSX and Dreamcast games. But if you are looking for a DVD case holder for PS2 games, do not buy this."
4,good sampler of the great Frankie Laine,"Mixed bag of re-recorded and original songs due to the movements of Frankie Laine between recording companies. Some songs look a bit affected by mannerism typical of the re-recordings when the artist (any artist) tends to ""over-do"" his original interpretation with the wrong idea that he/she can now do better. In any case here we are talking of Frankie Laine not a commone voice, therefore it is always a great pleasure listening to him. Price is also interesting so worth buying without hesitation despite the above considerations on the re-recordings."
4,Worth the money,"These discs have many of my favorite Frankie Laine hits and some numbers I've never heard before. Of all the Laine discs out there, these seem to have the most bang for the buck. I was particularly attracted to this set because it includes ""The Gandy Dancers Ball."" That number is not usually included in the Frankie Laine compilations, but I enjoy it more every time I hear it."
4,"Pleasant, Small, Simple Board","This is a small (6x10x3/4 inch) board from a reliable manufacturer. It will look nice on your table for serving cheese or a few rolls or bagels.This is a reasonable value in the $6-$8 range and makes a pleasant hostess gift for example; it has sometimes been available as a 4 for 3 item as well. Originally, I purchased 4 of these at a price of $5.50 to give as gifts. There are other totally Bamboo boards with more interesting patterns but at slightly higher prices such as theTotally Bamboo Anacapa End Grain LT Cutting Boardor their two color boardsTotally Bamboo Hana Cutting BoardandTotally Bamboo Huli-Molokini Cutting Board.Two warnings and a recommendation: Never put a wood cutting board in your dishwasher and never soak it. If you want a board that you can put in the dishwasher buy a plastic (polypropylene) one instead. Use a food grade mineral oil such asSnow River Wood Oilto keep wood kitchen items from drying out, splitting and staining."
2,not that celestial,I love early music for the beauty and celestial nature. But the title though seeming celestial was far from that. A good buy but not very good musically or in production.
4,Outrageous and funny,A man is hired to find a man's lover who has been kidnapped by a gang of girls and punish the women who did it. The lover turns out to be another man (a surprise) and the S&M hunter punishes the wrong doers with great relish primarliy using Japanese bondage. This is all done to a rousing Italian western movie music score and with tongue firmly in cheek and is pretty good black humor. You do not necessarily have to be a fan of Japanese bondage films to have fun with this film. It is definitely not a date movie though (well ....unless you have a VERY unusual date). The acting is quite good and picture quality is fantastic. This is actually the second of two films about the S&M hunter and I hope Pink Eiga releases the first one.
4,Rope enthusiast delight,"Rope, women and sex. Much like a gunslinger of the wild west, SM Hunter is a ropeslinger from the east. He uses his rope much like Indiana Jones used his whip. He twirls and throws his rope and it wraps around his victims. He is dresses like a priest and handles the job alone. His first and only real job is to rescue a gay man captured by a gang of women. The women force the gay man to have sex. Such a brutal torture. SM hunter rescues the guy and seduces the leader of the gang. At the end he does battle with the woman who took his eye."
3,"Better than many, but not all",This just wasn't the type of product I was looking for I guess. It didn't give me the fullness I was looking for but does continue to leave your hair smooth and shiny unlike a lot of other thickening products.
5,Good for Fine Hair,I have very fine hair and really love this product - it adds volume and is easy to work with - not sticky
2,Nioxin,"I have used Nioxin before, but this item did not perform as I expected. It seems to be ""watered down"". I will not order another product such as this on line. I will only buy from a reputable salon where they stand behind their products. My mistake."
5,Awesome product,This product is hard to find and at this price. I would definetly order from this vendor again. Very fast shipping. I would recommend this product and vendor to everyone.
3,A little disappointed with product.,"I was so excited to find this product. It has been very difficult for me to find it in any store or salon. It was fine at first but before the can was even remotely empty it was coming out like water and I could not use it. I was going to continue to buy from this seller, the same product, 2 at a time since I couldn't find it anywhere else, but I unfortunately had to change my mind."
2,The collection with out any collectables,It didnt have any of the songs on it that i was hoping for. but other then that-it was a good price and came in a timely manner!
2,Not the Right Version!,"This is the very shortened version of a wonderful program! I originally saw this on tv, and with commercials, it was 2 hours long. There was soooooo much more of the actual pirates' code but it is missing from this dvd. It's more about the recovery efforts and far less about the actual pirates. Not worth any money, really."
1,Are you looking at this because you didn't like the (i)Home - read on,"Well my family purchased an (i)home since we wanted to hear either the radio or our IPOD music in the morning. The two drawbacks with the (i)Home is (a) It's like shining a torch in your room at night and (2) when the radio/ipod goes off in the morning, the volume progresses from a low 0 to 20 (out of 30) in about 10 secs and blows the ears off you. I really ask myself who designs these things - they must be deaf.Well the reason why I elaborate on this is because this iLive has an equally disturbing blue light that shines in your room and secondly, it too blows the ears off you in the morniing. We're not a quiet family and we like our music loud but let's take the morning in perspective. We returned the iLive to Amazon and now we're looking for No. 3. We have been referred to the Jensen Clock radio/IPOD.Postives it has a remote control and its sound is very good (when you are actually willing to listen to it a high level!)"
2,iLive clock radio and dock for iPod,I was disappointed in this product. It looks and feels cheaply made. The manual has multiple typos and errors. And the sound quality is subpar. I wish I'd bought a better quality product from a store at twice the price.
2,Ditto ++,"Not only can I ditto the comments about the poor sound quality, the overly bright neon night light effect (We used post-it notes until we got adjusted to it.) and the fact the volume blasts you out of bed in the morning, I want to add that the directions are obviously written by a non-English speaker and are difficult to decipher. Does anyone know of an 800 number to call for help?"
2,Clock light is TOO bright,"I disregarded other reviews that stated the light was bright. I wish I hadn't. The light easily illuminates my son's entire room, such that he could read by it if he wanted to. The functionality isn't bad but we have had some trouble with setting time and alarm. This isn't an expensive product and I guess I got what I paid for!"
2,ilive ipod radio stereo,"at first it seems really good. The remote is hella nice and it has everything i want from ipod to radio to alarm and remote. It also has a really good price. It also charges the ipod. However, I hate how the blue backlight is always on, really annoying. And.... there's always static when the ipod is docked, more so when the ipod is fully charged for some reason. it is really annoying. but i found out, i can turn off the static if i keep my ipod backlight always on. overall, i wouldn't buy it unless you are really looking for something cheap and ur willing to handle the defects."
3,Does What I Required of It,"It charges the ipod successfully and has good sound on playback. For some reason the FM feature abruptly stopped working but I'm sure if I took and hour or two to peruse the rather Byzantine directions I could put that right, but I have a life. Used purely as a dock, however, it's great. The ability to adapt to any size ipod makes it a very useful addition to this houshold. My roommate has been getting as much use out of it as I."
1,JUNK,"There are better options out on the market for iPod clock radios. This one is too big, the numbers are so bright it keeps you up all night, the sound is not great and the buttons are cheap.I returned it."
1,"If you're looking for a nightlight, than look no further.","My boyfriend bought me this radio as a birthday present, and after three days we decided to return it. The blue light on the clock is so bright that it will completely light up your bedroom (and my bedroom is not that small). I actually had to wear an eye mask to block out the light from this radio."
2,"Great idea, needs work","The sound is much better than other ipod satellite speakers I have used, but still substandard. The blue backlight is way to bright, it lights up the whole room. It is impossible to read the time from any distance beyond a few inches. The unit does not keep good time as well. It has gained 8 minutes since I plugged it in two months ago.The remote control function is great. I love that I can hit snooze with the remote, or even set / enable the alarm."
2,"Nice potential, not all good though.","Awesome product if it worked well.I have a 5th generation iPod, the 30gb iPod Video. When docked and playing a movie, or scrolling through a title, the radio makes funky noises out of the speakers that are really annoying.I dislike that if I set the Volume at 6, and wish that when the alarm goes off in the morning, it would stay at volume 6, and not bump up to Volume 15 which is quite loud and dont wish to wake everyone else up in the house.Just gets bad feedback off of all iPod functions and all.I got it for christmas and I dont even use it, it sits on my desk with a piece of paper covering the extremely bright blue screen, with my iPod in it charging. I use my cell phone for my alarm in the morning.-Andrew Foxwell"
1,BEWARE-you can do better for same price,"I have this radio and it's a POS. Remote isn't very responsive and the display is WAAaay too bright (will keep you from sleeping if you are a normal person) and the user interface is terrible. The thing gets lousy reception and in general, there is a reason why this is always the lower priced iPod type radio on websites. They are trying to get rid of it because it s_cks!!!!!!!"
1,VERY Noisily!!!! Don't waste your money,"When docked the iPod, just started to make a funny noise... or scrolling through a title, the radio makes funky noises out of the speakers that are really annoying. That's unnaceptable!!!I returned next day... Then I got the iHome 5 .... works great!"
5,A really nice AM/FM Radio/Ipod player,"I have to disagree with some of the negative reviews on this product. I found it easy to learn how to program and the sound is far better than other reviews would lead you to believe. Depending on what you are using it for, I find the audio quite good. I suppose if you are playing hard rock music at a very loud volume you might be disappointed with the sound, but if that's what you want, buy a more expensive item. I learned to set the alarms, plug in my iPod with no problems. So far no problems with this product"
1,Keep looking for something better,"When playing the IPOD the unit has a whine, knocking and grinding that is quite loud and very distracting. I thought it was just the one that I was using at work, but when I listened to the one that I got for my room, it had the same problem. The other problem with it is that no matter what volume the unit was set at the last time it was used, the next time it is used it automatically comes on at a volume level of 17. If you are just using it home, it's not bad. But if you want it for your desk at work and you don't want everyone around you to be blasted by your IPOD coming on, you better have your hand over the volume control as soon as you turn it on."
3,OK sound - not so easy to use,This device is an OK entry level iPod player. This device is not intuitive and takes some time to learn how to use. The sound is OK to Good.
3,Dogs aren't smart?,"The layout of the book is very good and the contents are more complete than most others. It is packed full of useful information; from brief descriptions of the recognized dog groups, to choosing a puppy or adult and of which breed, to training and equipment, to common problems. Hodgson's training methods, however, leave something to be desired. Certainly they are not the worst I've seen, and they are humane. I'm sure many dogs could get by on her methods. What offended me was her viewpoint of dogs; at one point she actually said that she ""just isn't convinced that dogs understand""! Throughout the book she insists that dogs are LESS intelligent than most people feel. I'm sure she loves dogs but I personally prefer a trainer with a higher opinion of the canine race. By all means, buy this book for the info. However, if you want a training guide from which your pet can excel, get a book by Carol Lee Benjamin - someone who views dogs as the intelligent creatures they are."
3,"Not great, but not bad either...","Like most of the other folks who have reviewed this book, I also did not particularly appreciate the use of the book as a platform for selling special leashes. However, it is a decent general book that covers the basics pretty well in an easy-to-read format. I did learn a lot from the chapter on puppy personality and how to choose a puppy with a temperament you can live with and know how to handle appropriately. And there are some good ideas for training, but some are too strict for my tastes. My best luck so far has come from reading several training books to see how different experts handle the same situation, and then pick the method I think will work best for me and my dog. I just didn't pick as many from this book."
2,"Not bad, but there's much better out there","I agree the ""buy my leash"" stuff was irritating, but this book wasn't bad overall. I read the online reviews and decided to get Dogs For Dummies as my second book -- I just wanted a good reference to keep around the house. The Dummies book is lots better. I also liked the UCDavis Book of Dogs, for a good medical reference."
2,The author wants to sell her leash system,"I was not very impressed, yes there are a few good ideas, but to be honest with you, I am sorry I paid for it, I don't use it and to me it was a waste of money...the author is constantly pushing this leash system also, everything is related to it. There is better out there!"
1,An infomercial in paperback for,I was an idiot for buying it. The author hawks her leash product throughout the book and acts as if not owning one will make you a bad dog owner. The Dummies book is much better for new owners. The Monks of New Skete also do a really good job. Stay as far from this infomercial as you can!
5,Fantastic for those thinking about or having just adopted,"I raised my dog Idaho on the principles set out in this book. Training was a snap, and I have Sarah Hodgson to thank for that. A good deal of dog ownership is heeled on the fear of having to train or properly housebreak your new family member. Sarah's book reads in lamens terms and obliterates any fear whatsoever. I can't imagine where I would be without having first read this book before I met Idaho. A definite MUST-HAVE for any dog owner.By the way, I did not notice any blatant advertising in this book or self-serving anecdotes on Sarah's part."
4,Introduction to Atahualpa Yupanqui,"I bought this as an introduction to Atahualpa Yupanqui after hearing about him from an Argentinian friend. IF you like elaborate musical stylings, don't buy this. Some of the recordings are a little scratchy, as they probably were originally.IF you want classical Argentinian folk music and are interested in learning more of the cultural history of Argentina, check this out along with reading a little online about this famous citizen."
4,Very Easy.. no setup required,works right out the packagenicely packaged product. No need to plug and play. Take it out the package and start using.
3,"Good Quality, but slow shiping, and high cost.",I ordered this pen as a back up for my HP Compaq Tc 4400. The pen is well made and works great but the shiping took longer than expected. overall I recomend this if you really need it but the cost was so high.
3,stupid jacket,"this action figure is pretty cool. it has a cool pistol but the jacket looks like a girl's jacket. It's all sparkly and stuff. but if you have action figures, it's pretty cool to stage wars but I still don't like it very much.You've been warned"
3,cute but small,this was pretty small. it works well for cuttin' limes at a tequila party but that's about it. pretty though. and good quality.
4,Love Bamboo,"I love bamboo products but I bought this cutting board and when I was washing it for the first time I had so many tiny wood splinters in my hands and sponge that I had to throw the sponge out. Anybody else had this problem? I'm worried about cutting directly on it, I used wax paper. Kinda defeats the point. I wonder if it's going to keep coming off. I had assumed there would be some initial splinters, as I said, I own many bamboo products, but this was a considerable amount. It's such a pretty board, I hope it's done."
5,Small but good,"When I received it and opened the box I thought it was a bit small, more than I expected anyway. For the price though it is a great cutting board and I've had no problems with it cracking or anything (you're supposed to rub vegetable or mineral oil on it every now and then). I plan on buying another one from this company, this time a larger one though."
1,It sheds!,"Perhaps it's a lonely instance, but my board -- which was well cared for -- would shed little strands of bamboo which inevitably ended up in the food. I'd suggest the end grain bamboo boards as a better investment:Totally Bamboo Zambia Parquet End Grain Cutting BoardPS: That warning against the dishwasher is no lie. A friend dropped hers in and it came out horribly warped with separating ends."
3,"Good, very tiny cutting board.","It's a decent small cutting board. It's good for cheeses or slicing/paring small fruit or other things. However, if it gets wet... DRY IT IMMEDIATELY. Mind you, I live in Denver, so there is a lotta dry out here, but this thing starts warping pretty fast if you leave it wet and then it dries out on its own. The way it's made really does just help it along the crack/warp fest that happens with cutting boards.The board itself is pretty solid. I've taken several sharp knives and haven't had any chips or scuffs come out. Don't leave it soaking for sure, and don't throw it in the dishwasher.Aesthetically it's very nice. It's a clean looking board and even after a few raspberries and cranberries on it hasn't taken on much die. It looks like it does in the photos."
3,"Nice, but smaller than you think","Nice bamboo cutting board, but it is smaller than you think it is going to be."
4,Good attempt with the odds against them,"I love Callas and her wonderful coloratura. I'm also from L.A. so it's nice to hear a bit of art history in a town that is so often referred to as culturally devoid.This CD started with a poor master recording. Lots of pops and hisses, so the final result (I'm guessing) couldn't be made that great. Still, Callas' magic does come through, just much scratchier than I think she would want replayed."
5,Wonderful!,"Amazing...Callas is astounding. Nice to hear the Hamlet in French before her voice went. You get a sense of what the voice sounded like in the hall, and why it was so unique. Naughty Rescigno...his conducting isn't stellar, but Callas is still amazing!"
3,THE TELENOVELA...WHERE IS IT?,"Can someone tell me ""why"" primer amor a mil por hora hasn't been released; when just about all other teen or otherwise novelas, like my faves ""rebelde"" and ""amarte es mi pecado"" are out???..."
4,it's grabby,"While this is a great case that seems capable of lasting a while, its texture (not surprisingly) is similar to rubber. Thus, if it's attached to your belt and you shift while snuggling with your honey, he/she might have to shift, too, because your MP3 player grabbed him/her. I had read about the cheap case that comes with the Sansa, so I got this case with it. I cut up the cheap case and wrapped it around my MP3 player and then tucked it into the silicone case. This way, I protect my MP3 player from scratches and the weather. I only wish the silicone cases came in more colors (perhaps dark blue)."
2,not a big fan,"Really oscillated between giving this 1 or 2 stars, but it has not broken yet so going with 2 stars. The belt clip is somewhat difficult to use and I could see it ripping away from the rest of the case with daily use. What sealed it for me and had me go back to the ""cheap"" clear plastic case that the players come with, is that there is no part of the belt clip that protects the face of the player. If you carry your player in your pocket (when youre not running or at the gym) it easily picks up scratches on the face. There was no way I was going to switch back and forth every day.In any case, LOVE the player and down with Ipod, Zune and all of the other ones. LONG LIVE SANDISK!!"
1,Not A Books On Tape Player,"I listen to Books-On-Tape and digital downloads from my local library. I bought this player specifically for the library downloads because it is very specific about the wma content. Right away I noticed that I couldn't fast forward more than 30 minites before jumping to the next track 80 minutes away. I tried everything that I could think of to work around it including backing in from the next track and talking to the number given with the player. I sent it back and bought a Samsung YP-K3JQB/XAA, which I and my library downloads love. Be sure and get the skin to protect it."
4,case does what it needs,Good flexible construction. Not hot on the plastic clip. Can use armband from original Sansa MP3 player and weave in behind clip.
4,good case,"The case is good in that it fits snugly around the player, but is also easy to remove for battery changes. I've been using my case for about two years now and it hasn't ripped or even started looking dirty. I clip it on when I head out for my run, so it does get a fair amount of use and is still in good shape. The clip is good for armbands or waistbands, keeping the player steady and secure. The case doesn't provide any protection for the screen, however, and really should be included with the player. Shipping might be an issue. I ordered it once and it arrived promptly. When I ordered a second one as a gift, it arrived two months late."
5,Excellent for running,"I purchased this case to use with the Sansa M200 while running. I actually find it much more useful than the armband that comes with the player, because I can clip it to my water carrier waist band, or even to the waist band of my shorts, and run the earbud cord under my clothes so it's not flapping around while I run. Very pleased!"
1,Silicone Blue case,I love it..is soft and flexible..and keeps by MP3 player nice and so it doesn't get scratched up.
3,Plain and Simple,"We only had this case for a few days, as we had to return the players because neither of the TWO we bought worked longer than a week, but the case seemed okay...plain and simple."
1,Not worth it,"Clip is cheap and doesn't swivel. Ripped after 1 day. No protection for screen so what's the use? Go for the neoprene one with screen protector and swivel clip...more expensive, but well worth it."
2,can't get my cd to play all songs i burn,I burned a cd from my dell laptop and it will only play 10 songs or so. I thought one of the cds were bad so I tried again and it did it again. I am not sure why though. It will say error on the player and not want to eject. I wish I had some help.
1,*0 STARS*,I wish i could give this product 0 stars. This is a very cheap product. It does not even work. I needed the nasal aspirator for my 4 month old daughter and it didn't even work in the least bit! No suction whatsoever! I DO NOT recommend this product to anyone.
2,The music,"The music is okay, but the guy who sings does not sound Southern. This CD is not for those looking for songs from the former Southern Confederacy."
3,A GOOD DEAL,"this is a great bargain if you need the two movies to complete your collection. there is only one bad point though, they only come shrinkwrapped together. shame they dont come in a slipcase or something. anyway, these are the two least popular of the Hellraiser movies, but even so, they are still well made and most entertainingthey are both my favourites :O)"
1,Just the same self-help jargon,Just disappointed at what I thought would be new material. The authors pull information and strategies from other self-help resources to create this book.It would have been more helpful if the authors had drawn from their own experience.
2,Not a saltwater reference book,Don't by this book for saltwater fish. The pictures on the cover are saltwater but only one chapter is dedicated to them. It may be a good book for tropical freshwater fish but I'm not interested in freshwater fish.
1,Not for first-time FPS gamers :-(,"Having bought and loved the anime film Sin: The Movie, I thought I would buy the game and experience how the movie came to be. However, I very rarely play first-person shooters (Doom II and Marathon Infinity being the only real exceptions), and I find the controls for Sin to be far too complex for an FPS novice such as myself. Unfortunately, the training mode did not provide much help."
2,Sin-- a boring game from a tired genre,"It runs choppy, even on my G3. Uses the Quake engine, but it still feels old-scool like Duke Nuke 'Em. Been there, done that. Why bother?"
1,A huge waste of money,A really poorly executed game in a boring environment. The dialog is especially bad and you will soon be tempted to turn off all the sound. It often crashed. When it was running it ran so jerky and disconnected it lost all play value. A real disappointment. Do not waste your money with this game.
3,Everyday Geography of the United States,This book is good for wanting to know a brief description of each state. It is not a book for knowing each state in depth. The maps are not that good. It did not meet our purpose for buying it. We wanted a book that would tell us more about each state.
3,Suction cup mount,"Ok,Reached on time. This was basically for my friend as i had lost his original one :("
1,Poorly Listed Product,"This Product is not listed with a Garmin Part Number so you can not cross check to see if it is compatable with your GPS should you have a Garmin GPS that is not one of their listed numbers. Personally, I don't buy products that do not list complete spec's, sizes, part numbers and all relevent data."
1,Waiting,Can not review as still waiting for the items to arrive and it is 2 weeks past the latest expected delivery date.
4,as expected,nice price and is as expected. nice priceand is as expected. nice price and is as expected. nice price and is as expected.
2,Not great,This product worked great for the first 2 weeks then one morning I went out to my car and saw that the GPS had fallen off the windshield and was sitting on the dash. I had then realized that the suction cup was broken and had lost all grip and I had to throw it away. Great for 2 weeks then broke.
4,Suction cup,It arrived on time. I have not sure the item yet. It's very reasonable than buy it in the stores.
2,"Good while it lasted, but...","Only lasted about a week. Bought this mount to replace my original Garmin mount when the suction cup finally gave out(due to age, 2-3yrs). Tried it out on a couple of short trips around town, seemed to be fine. Used the first weekend after receiving for out-of-town trip to visit family. Arrived home late that weekend, made the mistake of leaving the mount stuck to the windshield where it stayed all the next day. The following morning I went out to my car to find the mount and my gps laying on the floor of the car. Inspection of the mount revealed that the suction cup had cracked and had broke loose from the rest of the mount. Regardless of being left on the windshield for a day, I don't feel that this product should have failed after less than a full weeks use. Apparently poor quality materials were used in the construction of this product. Therefore I cannot recommend the purchase of this mount in spite of its attractive price."
3,Garmin Suction Cup,"The first suction cup I received had a small tear in it around the post and fell off the window in a short time. The company quickly sent me another one, no questions asked and that one is working fine. I was very pleased that the company was so responsive and made handling this problem easy."
1,Poor Quality,"My original GPS mount lasted over two years. I purchased two replacements, the first one broke after 4 days. The second one broke the first day. Seems like the rubber is thinner and softer. The rubber disc pulled off the mount."
1,GPS Window Mount for Garmin,I only got to use this item once before it broke. I went to take the GPS off the mount and the spring inside came off and the rubber around the middle ripped. Just glad I only paid a few bucks for it. I did not get it from Garmin but from after market company.
1,"Fake, diffent construction from original.","I ordered this as a replacement. I broke my original after a year and a half of use. This replacement took less than a month to be destroyed. It has a funny looking spring inside that is different from the original. The suction cup does not line up accurately with the clampyloo, causing loss of suction resulting in your GPS falling off the windshield while you are driving. The rubber cup ripped off of the spring very easily. You have to utilize that little rubber pull tab on the side of the rubber cup, but with this product I was careful and it still ripped. I will try to find an original."
1,Buyer Beware,"Purchased this as a replacement for one I left in a rental car. Looked good and worked fine the first two times I used it...but the next time the suction part peeled away from the base and rendered it useless. I saw this issue in other reviews but figured it may have been operator error. Found out otherwise, turned out to be a cheap knock off of the original"
1,Broke after 2 uses,"Don't buy this product. I uses the original suction cup that came with my Garmin for almost 2 years before the rubber suction cup broke. I ordered this replacement, and it only lated 2 short trips."
1,Garman Windshield Mount,Our original suction cup mount lasted 4 years but this replacement only lasted one day. The rubber suction cup split and seperated from the mount and the GPS fell to the floor. We returned it and received a full credit.
1,Broke in a week,"It could have been because of the heat, I live in San Antonio, but the rubber suction cup piece broke off in a week"
1,Self-Destructing???,"Disappointed. After one month I found my GPS on the floor of my car. The suction cup was still on the window and was disconnected from rest of the mount. The plastic piece that extends into the center of the mount had broken where the drift pin holds it in place. Adding a customer photo to better explain the defect.I thought that this was a Garmin product but since I threw away the packaging and there is no markings on the mount, I don't know for sure.Purchased from Karbey Inc."
1,Don't buy ...,"As other reviewers have said - don't buy this replacement mount. Mine failed by the second day as well, with the suction cup separating at the same point as the photos. Waste of time, money as well as a huge inconvenience. It's junk."
1,It's true-- this one does NOT last!,"I bought this mount as a replacement for my original Garmin mount, which lasted about 3 years. Big mistake. This one lasted about 3 weeks! I don't normally remove the mount once I have it in place, and I do not even keep the GPS sitting in the bracket when not using it.Even so, the mount stayed firmly attached to the windshield--- until I used the GPS for a long trip-- The mount fell off about 2 hours into the trip. Upon closer inspection, it was obvious that the suction cup had torn/separated from the plastic mount inside the bracket base! All this was done without pulling or applying any pressure whatsoever to the mount-- Very simply, the weight of the GPS itself (a small Nuvi 200 series) was enough to cause the suction cup to separate!What a joke. save your 2 bucks+shipping and buy a genuine Garmin mount. This imitation is a lousy piece of cheap cr@p."
1,BAD QUALITY,"IT BROKE IN THE FIRST USE, BAD QUALITY PRODUCT, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY IN THAT THING, THE PRODUCT IF CHEAPER BUT NOT WORK"
5,Garmin NUVI 200 Suction Cup Mount,The Garmin Suction Cup Mount for the StreetPilot C510 and C550 is a perfect fit for my Garmin NUVI200.
5,It Really Sucks,"But that's what suction cups are supposed to do. The little ball clasps onto the GPS, and you don't even have to lick the other side to have it stick to your window. Just push the lever downward and voila! as they say in Italian, it sticks to the window.This little sucker is like a pet to my Garmin. The original ran away from when I was in Vermont two weeks ago, and I didn't feel like driving back up there to look for it. Besides somebody probably took it home already, ran over it, or stepped on it rendering it unserviceable. Now that I have this one, I fully expect to come across it in my luggage or when it gets free from its intractable spot under a car seat.This is not good in states that don't allow them on windshields."
1,To Small,"My Old Garmin Suction Cup mount, keep falling off my windshield which ended up pulling the charging cord out. I had to replace both. This suction cups ball that is holds the garmin in is to small so the Garmin keeps falling down. I am very disappointed!."
2,"Poor copy of the ""real thing"" Does NOT stick on window AND ball joint is a sloppy fit.","Poor copy of the ""real thing"" Does NOT stick on window AND ball joint is a sloppy fit. The suction stuck on the window the first few days and then my GPS fell off the window onto the dash. It will not stick longer than a few minutes and comes off."
1,Zero stars. Negative-1 star.,"Although the powerful suction cup worked great out of the box, within a week it broke and fell off the windshield, and I wasn't even using it at the time (the GPS was stowed elsewhere). A plastic piece simply broke where the suction cup is mounted on the plastic, making it unusable. Perhaps the plastic couldn't take the heat from the car sitting in the sun? Whatever. It's certainly inexpensive. However, it's a complete waste of time and money, unless you only need the mount for a day, then plan to throw it away!In addition, I had to email the seller weeks after I still hadn't received the item. The shipper did apologize, ship the item, and credit my account, meaning I got the item for free. However, I still can't recommend it, not even for free. Not unless you plan to keep a case of 48 of them in your trunk (a year's supply? Six months?) so you can use a new one every day when they keep breaking."
1,Got what I paid for,The vendor tried his best to have a satisfied customer and sent me a replacement unit free of charge but the units are just of low quality. The first one broke within days and the second won't stay put on the windshield.
1,Not as good as Akron GN115,"I hate to say this about a Garmin product, as I really like Garmin, but next to the Akron GN115 this is really cheap."
3,acceptable for the job,"the cup works fine until it looses suction due to hot or cold temp. wet it,set it and your done!"
1,Not OEM quality,I bought this as a back up since the cup that came with the unit was beginning to lose it's grip. I finally used this last month and it lasted 10 minutes. The rubber on the cup ripped apart where it is connected to the latching mechanism - no way to repair
2,should have taken closer look at product shown on site.,"this item is perfect as far as it goes, but it is not the complete item that I thought i was ordering; i guess i should have looked closer to the item pictured before ordering."
1,Broke on 2nd day,"It arrived quickly and had amazing suction. I was thrilled since my original lost its suction power. I put it up 2 days ago - was driving today - went around a corner and my Garmin flew across the dashboard, hit the window then into the floorboard. I thought it lost suction, but it was the actual unit itself. The rubber piece that attaches to the window broke away from the part that attaches to the GPS. Obvious poor construction - can't be fixed :("
1,Doesn't Stick,This does not stick to my wind shield at all. I've tried all of the tricks but now I have to order a different one.
5,Replacement,"Nothing bad to say, delivery was fast, and products works great!My suction cup broke a while ago so when I found this product I ordered without questions!Had no problems"
1,"Piece of crap, don't buy it","I forget my original suction cup in the rental car, so I thought this would be good replacement.I used it for one day and the suction cup already break into two pieces when I trying to put it on the windshield. It breaks just like the picture depicted by the reviewer ""Dip"" here. Because the way it was designed, there is no way to glue it back because it was held together by the perforated rubber.That's what you get for getting it cheap.So I got a real one from Garmin."
1,"cheap, now broken",not OEM. price is cheap and so is the quality. suction part broke off from mount after one day. do not buy!!!
1,Does not work.,Only had this for a month or so and regardless of what I do the suction cup won't hold. I have cleaned the window and suction cup but it wont hold up. This is garbage.
1,Garmin suction cup mount,This must be a knockoff version of this product since the suction cup will only temporarily hold on the glass. Like the old adage - you get what you pay for.
1,Don't Buy this Product,"This product is a substandard part and poorly constructed . Compared to the OEM model I had before, this is a poor substitute. The suction cup was very hard to get it to seat on a flat surfaces and below par to start with. Yesterday, it failed completely (only days after the return period expired.) The suction cup detached from the lever."
3,Serves The Purpose,"This item is not as well made as the original suction cup but it serves the purpose. The only disappointment is that the neck is not as long as the original, thus the viewing opitions are a little limited."
5,Good replacement for the one that failed,"Garmin needs to design these bases and suction cups to be more sturdy. I've replaced two of them on this particular GPS in three years. Thankfully they're not incredibly expensive to replace, and they are the main moving part with the GPS."
3,Garmin Suction cup,Suction cup poorly made. Had to order replacement because it wouldn't stick to the window anymore.
2,Watch for the lever pin,"Had it for 3 years of occasional uses (a couple of times a months). Now the suction is so weak that it would drop after about 2 hrs. I have to remember to reattach before that ""deadline"".Today, I discovered that the pin in the suction lever had slid out, only holding one end. The thing is literally falling apart. If you lose the pin, it'd spell the end for the mount.So I just got the friction mount, which Garmin should've supplied as the stock accessory."
1,Broke After 2 days,"Bought this mount to replace the original mount which I had left in a rental car. The original mount had lasted 2 years. This mount stopped working after 2 days. I tried cleaning the suction cup to no avail, it turned out that a portion of the rubber was ripped and there was no fixing it. Do not buy this mount - not worth it at any price."
2,Doesn't work as well as the original.,"The unit does not hold onto the windshield like it should. I have tried cleaning the glass and the suction cup and it still continues to fall off periodically after being applied. ... and yes, I did take off the protective sheath before using it."
1,Poorly made!,"My old mount lasted for years, this one lasted for 2 days, before it fell off the window and broke."
1,NOT Genuine Garmin - Broke 2nd Day I Had It,"You get what you pay for. Mine broke (the rubber suction split from the body) the 2nd day I had it. I contacted the seller & they did send me a new one, free of charge. Too bad that one broke the same way, a week later. I just ordered my replacement from Garmin, done dealing with knock off items claiming to be genuine on Amazon."
2,Bought two of these,I bought two of these. One from one vendor and one from another. One fell apart in days but the other is still working
5,Purchasing,"While I really needed a new suction cup for my Garmin, its not so much the product that I am rating as it is the company I purchased it from. Its great to know that there are such reputable companies that you can purchase from on line. I had an issue with my purchase and notified the company. They immediately rectified the situation to my satisfaction !!! I will use this company in the future !!!"
1,i didnt recive the item,i didnt recive the item i dont now how to claim it because i dont speak english very wel
1,Item image does not match description or item number,The image shown as of 11/15/07 in no way whatsoever matches the image shown at the Garmin website for this product number (010-10747-00.) It doesn't evenly remotely resemble what the title describes either. What the heck is a cord doing there and where is the ball for the ball joint connector?
4,Good,I bought a GPS at a pawn shop because I needed it to find the way to rochester and it came without a stand so I looked and found this one for a good price.
1,garmin suction cup,the suction cup fell apart after 2 uses the original one that came with the unit lasted for years this was a piece of junk
4,Works as it should,"compatible with my Garmin Nuvi 1450. Ball socket snaps onto GPS bracket with proper amount of pressure to allow for easy bracket adjustment without subsequent movement, i.e., once adjusted it stays put. The suction device is easy to engage/disengage and once fastened it hasn't lost its grip yet, although it hasn't been tested in a hot (100 deg) environment to date."
5,Exact replacement part,"Garmin wanted $69 or so for the entire mount assy for my Zumo 550. All I needed was the suction cup itself, as mine tore inside where the metal support pulls it in. after years and years of use. Lo and behold I find this bracket /suction cup assy. All ya do is push the roll pin out and put the suction cup onto my Zumo mount, like new. Super secure on the windshield, as it was dropping off when the cup is torn inside, as the spring arm can't pull it tight. This made it like new. It's the exact same suction cup for most Garmins. and I got speedy delivery, no shipping charges, great place to buy from. Super fast delivery!"
1,poor product,"I returned this item. It was supposed to come with a disc to put it on the dash, but that wasn't in the box. I already had the sandbag holder, but it wouldn't stay when I made a turn, so I wanted something that would keep my garmin in place. Ultimately, I got some velcro that had adhesive on both sides and it worked beautifully."
1,junk,It broke the third time I used it. The rubber is very poor quality and split. There is NO WAY this is OEM for Garmin.
1,Very poor quality,"This mount is of very poor quality!! The rubber suction cup is attached to a round steel plunger by means of tiny holes around the outter edge of the steel plunger. There are tiny ""tits"" (like on the sidewalls of a new tire) of rubber that stick through the tiny holes. The rubber also forms around to the top side of the steel plunger which seems to take only a few days to slpit and expose the small holes in the plunger. Tired of purchasing replacements for this Nuvi 760. I prop ot up on the seat next to me for now. When I have the time, I will make a braket that will hold it on the dash. Good Luck Buyers!!"
1,poor quality,The suction cup tore less than 2 hours after I put it on the windshield. This is a generic product and not Garmin. Very poor quality.
1,Does not stick!,This was a replacement to my original garmin suction cup. It flat out does not work! it falls off the window and crashes down on my dash within 5 minutes everytime I put it up. Don't bother buying this - it doesn't work!
4,Good replacement,"Good replacement mount for the Garmin Nuvi. Original unit was wearing out and no longer stuck to the windscreen for more than a few minutes. New unit is the same size as original unit, some reviews have stated it as smaller, and appears to be of the same build quality as the original unit. Very happy with replacement unit."
1,Didn't Last,Bought as a replacement to original 3-4 yr old Garmin where the suction cup started to tear from the mount. This suction cup didn't last but a couple months before it started to separate.
5,Perfect,"This was exactly what I was looking for. Its just the piece pictured, so you'll need to hold onto your existing cradle or purchase one seperately. This thing is great. My old one lasted a few years before the sun wore out the suction cup."
3,"Fast delivery, inexpensive, suction warps","This is the second batch of 3 I've purchased.Delivery is fast (about 1 week to CA) and they're inexpensive.However, I buy 3 since I usually have one the does not have suction because it's warped or the suction cup separates from the base.Bottomline buy more than 1 at a time."
1,Absolute Junk,"I bought this item a while back but only today took it out of the packaging. After attaching it to my gps and the windshield, everything was great for about 2 hours. I came back to the car only to find my gps lying on the dash and the little piece of rubber that goes to the windshield lying next to it. The rubber had ripped and the mount is now useless. This thing is garbage."
1,Very Poor Made Item,I purchased this item because my orginal windshield mount broke. Thinking that this would last equally as long as the orginal was my thought. I was wrong! I placed it on the windshield and within 5 minutes the whole unit fell to the floorboard. The rubber suction cup tore and separated from the hard plastic housing. I don't know if this was just a faulty item or if everyone of these mounts are inferior compared to the orginal that came with the unit. Just be advised that there is a weak link in this item and it's the rubber to hard plastic connection. No way to repair this item. Needs to be thrown in the trash.Amazon will not give a credit or refund so money is gone.
1,Suction cup sheared off from the mount!,"As the title says, the suction cup itself sheared off from the metal part of the mount's base. I live in a hot and humid part of the world (Manila, Philippines) and the mount gets exposed to the heat while driving. I started to notice that the suction cup mount would oftentimes pop off the windshield. Eventually, as I was driving one night, the mount fell on my dash, leaving the actual suction cup on the windshield. Don't buy this product!"
1,was good for 15 minutes !!!!,got 2 pieces for 2 garmins.after 15 minutes on the windshield the unit broke into 2 parts.the suction cup fully detached from the base.the other piece just keep on falling after few minutes.just ordered original garmins. i guesss you get what you pay for.
1,Fell and broke my Garmin,The suction cup fell off my windshield and my Garmin broke. I hate this product. Now I have to buy a new Garmin because I cheaped out on the stupid stand. F---!
1,Broke after 6 hours of use!!,I attached this to my windshield and my NUVI 755t and within 6 hours the little plastic tabs that attach the suction cup to the mount had broken. The GPS was fortunately attached to the charging cord which I'd wrapped around my rear view mirror so the GPS survived.There really wasn't an acceptable excuse for this. The temperatures were moderate and the mount hadn't been moved. I'm very disappointed.
3,I Wish it Would Suck Harder,"Although this mount looks identical to the one that came with my Garmin, it seems to lose suction and fall off the window at the most inconvenient times. I've even tried moistening the suction cup before installation and sometimes it falls off even then. Luckily, it hasn't busted my Garmin but I can only attribute it to the construction of my dashboard that keeps it from falling entirely to the floor. You could imagine the mayhem that would cause on a busy, unfamiliar highway! The mount that came with my unit originally was never a problem over the 2-3 years I had it, so this is troubling. Other than that, it performs as well as the original."
1,Don't waste your money,I was pleasantly surprised to pay less than $5 for this suction cup especially after it was shipped all the way from Great Britain. Unfotunately it lasted less than a day before the suction cup tore away from its mount rendering it useless. Buy the original Garmin product and save yourself the money and aggrivation.
2,"OK Product, Wouldn't Buy Again","The mount fits properly into my Garmin, but it does not hold on the movable pad that goes on the dashboard. This was purchased for a Garmin in a second car, and the first Garmin has an OEM mount. That one holds perfectly to the pad and has to be pulled off, sometimes after being on for weeks. With his mount, it typically falls off the pad within a day or less. So, it works for one trip, but has to be reattached to the pad each time. Claims to be an OEM product, but really doesn't work like it should."
1,Disappointed!,"I purchased two of these cups, two weeks ago and I'm already looking for a new one. I looked at the reviews on here, and they were overwhelmingly positive regarding the quality & performance of this suction cup. The first one I used lasted a week, before the black part separated from the back. The second one, only lasted one day! What's disappointing is the temp didn't even make it to 80 degrees that day."
3,Great While It Lasted,"I bought this as a replacement for the stock unit that came with my NUVI GPS. I found it very convenient and easy to use while it lasted, but the plastic hinge (that tilts the unit up and down) broke too easily rendering the unit useless. As a mechanical engineer I feel qualified to say I believe the mechanism is poorly designed and too fragile. I did buy a replacement as it sticks to the windshield well, is very compact, and is very convenient, but I will definitely be more careful when handling it in the future. Note: I have also used the ""bean bag"" type dash mount. By comparison, the bean bag works well, but the additional bulk and weight makes it less convenient when traveling. I primarily use it in areas where windshield mounts are illegal (like California). Both units allow you to plug the charging cord into the holder or directly into the unit."
5,Perfect replacement,Got this a few days back and it fits perfectly with the Nuvi265T.Was able to get it for a good price as well.
1,Junk,This thing is a piece of junk. I question whether it is a Garmin part - it came in an unmarked plain plastic bag. After using it a grand total of two times it seems to have broken and won't hold. I would rather have paid more for something that works.
4,Very useful Suction cup mount,"Very good and useful suction cup mount for my Garmin GPS, as I was having problem with my existing one."
1,Lasted not even a few hours !!!,"Read the reviews and heard about a bad batch a while back. Figured that this issue had been resolved by now, I ordered one as a replacement for my four year old mount. Item arrived and I mounted the GPS on the dash. After my 90 minute drive, I removed the GPS from the mount - an old habit to prevent it from falling when the old mount failed. Returned to the car after a few hours only to find the mount lose. Trying to attach it, I noticed that the suction cup was broken at its attachment point. The poor thing just sat there for a few hours and managed to brake itself.As a long time customer I have to ask: Really, Garmin, is this the quality you want us to associate with your products now?One star only because I cannot give it a no star rating!!"
1,Cheap,The suction tore apart the second time using it. I would not recommend this and would surely not buy another
1,Garbage,"This thing lasted almost an entire week before it fell apart. I do not advise purchasing it, for it is build of the most shoddy construction."
3,Sticks with removal of plastic tab only,"Working good in 1st month, but this cups have hard time supporting weight of NUVI 680. Having purchased replacement, I thought they would have fixed the issues, but it is same old suction cup"
1,Cheap Junk,I had originally purchased 3 of these (one for each car) in April. The first two seperated from the rubber the very first time suction was applied to the glass. I did not even get a chance to mount the GPS before they broke. The third broke within a week when I noticed the GPS on the seat the next morning when I got in my car. Steer clear of these and go with another brand or genuine Garmin. The rubber came apart from the mount like they were dry rotten.These are total Junk.
5,Does what it is supposed to do,"I ordered this with quite a bit of intrepidation. Many people had said it was not OEM, and it did not work like their previous Garmin mount. Well, I just got this, and it sure looks like the real McCoy. In fact, the only difference I could see is a number above the ""made in china"" inscription. My original number (die number?) was 10. This one was 27. Other than that, they looked EXACTLY THE SAME. Both say Garmin on them.I ordered this replacement because after 3 years of use and now baking in the Florida sun, it comes off in the mid day heat. I just received this, so I will update if this does not fix that problem. However, from the out of the box experience, It looks perfect. One hint, place some spit on the suction cup before placing it on the windshield. It will help create and maintain the seal. Garmin does not provide that level of helpful hint!"
1,Poor quality,I purchased this because the original that came with my garmin broke after about three years of use between the suction cup part and where the suction cup part mounts to the plastic part. This one just broke the same way after about two weeks of use. I'll do without I guess.
1,"JUNK - Even for 5 cents, it is not worth it","Used it once, detached it from window (correctly), put it under the seat of my car, came back out a couple days later to use it again, and the suction cup part that holds onto the spring had completely just disintegrated. OMG, what a piece of you know what. Geez."
1,What a let down,I purchased this product last week - I have been using it less than a week and it just fell off my windshield. It is broken - the suction cup separated from the bracket. I even paid extra for a faster delivery. I will be contacting Amazon or the vendor. I need a bracket immediately!
1,Doesn't Work,"I ordered this to replace a factory part that was 3 years old and no longer working. I was getting it for an upcoming road trip. I got it about two weeks before the road trip, and within 3 days it didn't work. The rubber of the suction cup pulled away from the actual base. The rubber was torn, and there was no way to fix it. I didn't care to spend shipping on a replacement, so I ordered a factory part through Garmin. Don't spend your money on this."
1,"In a word they ""Suck""",This bracket came apart 2 min. after mounting it to my windshield. The rubber on the suction cup tore loose from the part that attaches to the lever. A complete piece of crap.
1,Arrived broken,"The unit uses a lever-actuated suction cup to stick to the dash or windshield. The lever pulls on a rubber flange on the suction cup. These units fail when the flange comes off the lever because the rubber tears. My Garmin OEM mount gave out after a year plus, so I ordered this one. IT CAME BROKEN!! The defective unit was sold by one company but the order was fulfilled by another company. I ordered another one from a different company but it turns out this company is the one that fulfilled the first order. So beware: I thought I was buying a different unit from a different company, but no. Amazon has at least two product listings for the same DEFECTIVE product!"
1,Broken - first use,The rubber ripped away from the plastic within a week of purchasing this mount. I have a light touch yet it still ripped apart. Don't buy this part....I am searching for another replacement.
1,Bogus design,"We're on our third suction mount in less than 5 years of Garmin usage. This product needs a complete redesign, as this failure rate is unacceptable. As a former Design Engineer, I would be ashamed to have my name attached to this product. I can only laugh at the schmucks who probably spent hours and hours in meetings and at the CAD terminals dreaming up this beauty."
1,Broke on 1st Use,"I bought 3 planning to use 2 and have a spare... after all, they were cheap. First time I used it the suction cup broke off from the base. The suction cup stuck to and stayed on the windshield, however the base and the Garmin landed on the dash."
1,Suction cup back came off in couple of days,Had this product for couple of days only when the suction cup backing came apart from the hard plastic piece rendering the product useless.
1,not happy,Window suction material ripped within 3 days the item then is a garmin on the dash sliding back and forth with each turn. I drove to Best Buy and purchased a bean bag dash top type mount.
2,Disappointed,"First off! I noticed the original ball mount had a rubbery coating which made for a firmer fit than the new one ordered here. Not a big deal, but might allow the GPS system move around or fall out over rough terrain. The really disappointing thing is, after only a couple of weeks of normal use, the suction cup ripped and it's now useless. Spend the few extra bucks and get the replacement mount made by Bracketron, it's much sturdier with a larger silicone (more durable) suction cup."
1,Dried Rubber,The rubber at the bottom of the mount was dried and cracked. The rubber base separated from the base the first time I tried to use it. I ended up gluing it to my bean bag base without the rubber suction cup. It was cheap enough that I id not return it nor contact the seller. It took a long time to come after ordering.
1,Not satisfied,2 of the 3 suction cup mounts I ordered did not last 1 trip. I have not used the 3rd. The rubber mount connected to the spring split and no longer suctions to the windshield. The mount was not damaged by removing from the windshield. When I returned to my car the mount was laying on the dash. I do not recommend this product.
1,Terrible,"The suction cup, if it stays put at all, will fall off in minutes. I would not reccommend this item."
3,Does the Job,This product was to replace a lost mount. I didn't realize that it did not have the adjustable base like the one that came from Garmin. It does the job but the adjustability is missed.
5,Good Mount,Good mount. arrived on estimated time. fit the gps perfectly. No problems so far. Stays on the windshield even going over rough terrain or speed bumps. solid construction
4,Worked great - for less than one day. (updated),"After the suction cup mount died on my Zumo 550 I was thrilled to find this replacement for such a reasonable price. It was a direct replacement for my old one and simply snapped into the vehicle mount for the GPS. The new suction cup worked great when I used it on my next business trip.Less than 12 hours later, I snapped the GPS back into the mount and the whole unit fell from the windshield, the suction cup had torn where it attaches to the mount. Incidentally, this is the same failure the original mount had, but the first one lasted over four years.UPDATE: I contacted the seller and they promptly mailed out a replacement without me having to send in the defective unit. So while it looks like they got a bad batch of suction cups, I give high marks for some great customer service."
4,Amazing Customer service!!!,Awesome customer service. The product is a great replacement for the manufacture's product. I was concerned because it was so inexpensive. No complaints as it is an exact fit.
1,Low Quality Product,"I received the product in a broken condition and it seems like the product is of low quality.Seller replaced the broken part, but still it broken\ in couple of days..Not recommended"
2,Suction gone in ~2hrs; Pin slides out,"Had it for 3 years of occasional uses (a couple of times a months). Now the suction is so weak that it would drop after about 2 hrs. I have to remember to reattach before that ""deadline"".Today, I discovered that the pin in the suction lever had slid out, only holding one end. The thing is literally falling apart. If you lose the pin, it'd spell the end for the mount.So I just got the friction mount, which Garmin should've supplied as the stock accessory."
4,OEM....works.,"Only reason why I am giving this a 4/5 is because of the price. A 10 cent piece of plastic being sold for 10 dollars. It's OEM size. Same one that my Garmin Nuvi 750 had. That original one lasted me about 2 years until the suction cup portion tore off.If you want this to replace the one you got with your Garmin, go for it."
4,good replacement for original one,"for original one, come with GPS, it had many pieces including some connection in the middle - my wife somehow, somewhere lost that connection (bolt/nut type), so can't be used. this one is one-piece and works well so far. once got stuck, so far, it didn't come out from the mount. very good so far."
2,not made to wothstand heat..,"Bought two. One failed within two weeks. When using the defective one, placing the weight of the GPS and shortly after it will become loose from the window and fall to the ground.The vendor delivered in a timely manner."
3,Garmin suction cup,The mount worked great but the suction has already ripped so I am unable to now use it. The price was right and it worked fine until the suction tore. I still thank you
1,Garmin replacement suction cup mount has issues,"This product is MUCH shorter than the original and you can not lift the antenna. It binds against the windshield. I would not recommend this product. Good price, bad function."
1,"after just few uses, bottom suction area riped. it went into trash can less than week.","dont waiste time and money with this product. after few trys, the bottom suction area riped and it went into trash can less than week.since than i've purchased Garmin Friction Mount, and works great happy with it."
2,Not good,"It arrived quickly, had amazing suction at first and was identical to the original which failed after approximately 1.5 yrs of use due to the rubber suction cup tearing away from the mount itself. Unfortunately, this new one turned out to be a piece of garbage and failed in the same way after only 3 weeks. There has to be a problem with the rubber itself or the way it's mounted because I take meticulous care of my GPS unit and don't abuse it at all. Now I'm not sure what to do; try another one or go with a totally different mounting system all together. It's very annoying and inconvenient."
1,Low Quality Junk,"I got this thing after the original from Garmin broke after two years. This one looks just like the original, but it's cheap Chinese junk made from substandard materials. It lasted less than two months, then the rubber suction cup ripped where it attaches to the mount.Save yourself the headache. Order the real one from Garmin."
4,Good but not great,Fits fine on my garmin GPS and not expensive. Only minor issue is it is quite hard to stick and remove from your vehicles windshield.
3,OK,"It was exactly what was looking for but it lasted as long as the original. Not long, the rubber breaks after being in the vehicle."
4,Garmin replacement,"Excellent replacement, suction cup sticks. Sometimes the suction pops but not like my other cup. Would've gotten 5 stars if suction was consistent."
1,Broken so fast,"Installed a few days ago. Yesterday, when I want to connect my GPS into it, it broken. So bad. Then on my travelling way, I have to put the GPS in my hand."
1,Not like original. Not worth it,"This was supposed to replace a part that broke after 5 years. This one lasted 10 times tops. The rubber broke away from the unit. In addition, the arm wasn't long enough and so the unit hit the windshield and could only face directly forward...could not be rotated. Terrible replacement."
1,dont work,The suction cup does not work.I ended up spraying it with contact cement and gluing it to the windshield.
1,Suction Cup,"Bought two of these suction cups because the price was right. The first application used lasted only one day. Where the cup is applied to the window, the rubber just ripped all around in a big circle, as if there was to much graphite used in the formula in making the rubber."
4,Exactly what we needed,"It fits our GPS, as well as the original one. The price was excellent. We got it much sooner than expected."
3,It's OK,"Works fine, but the lever is a little creaky and/or sweeky. But it does stick to window fine. Thank you,"
5,Great replacement,The original suction cup was not holding any more. This replacement looks just like the original and holds great. Prompt shipment.
5,It works and it's cheap,It does exactly what it's supposed to do. Besides it doesn't cost very much. What more could you ask for?
5,good alternative to oem,fit perfectly in my 93 celica and works as it should. don't forget to get the thermostat gasket which is not included. recommend this thermostat.
5,Fun for my Child,My 2 1/2 year old child got this for Christmas and loves it. He rides it everyday-inside and out. He is your typical boy and it seems to holding up well. The wide tires seem to keep him well balanced and does not tip over as easily as your regular tricycle. We put a bike horn on the handle bars for more added fun for him. The seat with the back makes it easier for him to peddal since he has something to push against. His cousins enjoy it just as much when they come to visit.
5,I almost want one myself!!,"(...)When we took it out of the box, I was so excited. The parts are very sturdy and the colors are very catching. It did bother me that there were no assembly instructions included, we managed though (I hope we got it right). It's just so cute... I really wanted to ride it myself..."
3,Topple Over,"Although I love the bright colors of this bike it is not very safe or durable. The bike is so light that when my son turns the handle bars, he falls off. Since I bought the bike many of my friends and neighbors have purchased the bike only to confirm my findings as well, the bike is NOT SAFE. How safe is that for a child? I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND this bike to anyone."
4,almost perfect,"We bought this for our energetic grandson who is 2 yrs old.It is impressively sturdy, however the parts did not quite fit together, so grampa had to shave off the paint inside the hole on the handlebar axle to get the pipe through... kind of frustrating you would'nt expect this from German made machined parts...Once we got it together, It looks fantastic! This is a good size first trike for any active youngster!"

Goten and Trunks try to immediately refuse to help, but not enough time has passed.

1,"Poor quality torch, broke after one week.","A good crème brlée requires a good torch. This isn't it. After just one week of use, it stopped working. It felt like cheap quality plastic and had an awful rubber smell to it."
4,Great Baby doll but for much older baby,My Daughter got this for Christmas when she was 6 months old. The rattle is to heavy and it will hurt if baby gets hit my it. Go with a soft baby doll for a 6 month old.
2,The rattle can cause injury!,"Cute 1st baby for a little girl. However, the rattle is heavy and can really smash a baby in the face. It only took once for me to realize that. I took the baby away from my daughter until recently. She's a year old now so I'm giving it another go. Also, the hair is like...nylon or something and comes out easily. Be careful. I'd opt ofr a baby with a built in rattle. What were they thinking making a stuffed baby with a heavy plastic rattle SEWED in to her hand?! Better yet, what was my Father thinking when he bought it!"
3,A Baby's Baby,"My 15 month old received this for her first birthday, but it just became appealing to her. Especially the rattle. I guess because her father and I are so affectionate with her, she does hte same to her dolly. It takes a while for babies to get used to playing with a dolly though"
4,Prejudice?,"This is a great ""white"" doll. Please don't automatically assume that your race is being discriminated against. Fisher Price does offer an African American version of this doll too."
2,Didn't like it,My little girl who is now 17 and a half months old got this for her first Christmas whaen she was 8 and a half months. She chewed on it for a while when she first got it but since then hasn't touched it once. It really dosen't do anything so she's not interested in it. She likes more interactive educational toys that make noise and do things besides lay there. She's always been that way.
1,Ignores Multi-culturalism,"I gave this product 1 star across the board because it is very ignorant of the multicultural makeup of our world. This doll is only available as a white, blonde haired and blue eyed doll. What of the black, hispanic, and asian children? Where are the dolls that represent them?My daughter is biracial, and I want her to experience both parts of her heritage, however, dolls like this do nothing to encourage that. I believe that Amazon.com should at least take the time to note that the doll is only available in one racial makeup and save people the time and effort of looking around.As a side note, for those interested, American Girl makes a first doll that has many varities based on ethnicity."
5,the #1 snuggle baby (according to our princess),"Our daughter wants this baby all the time - especially when upset and/or tired. She's 20 months and has been obsessed with it all her life even though she has lots of other dolls and stuffed animals. CUT THE RATTLE OFF! It's the only flaw, but is easily removed so buy this anyway. When she was going through her first teeth, she'd try to eat the hair so we cut that off too. But, she has 2 more - one for the car and one for Grandpa's!"
3,This is an o.k. baby doll but not the best,"Someone gave this to my daughter when she was close to a year old. She still has it, and she is 3...so it lasts through lots of play, but the person who said the rattle is too heavy is right! Also, I would not recommend this for small babies or even those who are under the age of 2 who are putting things in their mouths...I had to put it up for a while because of that, and then when she was older, it was much better for her."
1,Cute but not popular,I bought this for my 6 mos. old as I thought she had to have a babydoll. Although she is cute my 6 mos. old was not impressed--and now at 1 year old she still isn't impressed with the baby. The baby was inexpensive but apparently isn't all that interesting for my energetic and highly inquisitive baby.
2,Owwww!,"That is one hard rattle! And it really makes a knock when it hurts your baby's head! No lie, that thing is heavy and if they pick it up it will nail them.Plus, I think the doll needs more stuffing or something. It's weird how it's head is empty and you just feel the plastic face.I would say they should change the age range to begin at 12 months when a baby is less likely to hurt herself."
2,Watch that Rattle! Way too heavy for this doll,"We bought this for our infant at about 8 months old. I cannot tell you how many times that darn rattle hit her in the head. It isn't a ""cuddly"" doll at all. The rattle also unbalances the doll making it hard to hold. Cute doll overall, but they should get rid of that rattle or possibly replace it with a soft-side style rattle - not that hard 5 lb. rattle. You may be better off getting the gund ""first baby"" it is soft all over."
2,Kind of dangerous,The rattle is way too heavy. The doll can use more stuffing. The dangerous part comes in when my daughter was younger and she flung her doll around and the heavy rattle hit her in the head. My daughter was 4 months when she got the doll and at 5 months I put it away. Now at 10 months she seems to be playing with it fine. I would recommend changing the age of this toy to a baby who has more control of his/her arm functions.
4,Nana likes my First Baby in Pink,"Cute doll and perfect except for the big, heavy rattle in its hand.I had already read about the rattle but it is big. I'm holding off giving it to her until Christmas because maybe by then she won't be swinging things around so much and hit herself in the face."
3,average gloves,"Gloves were average to below average . Like too many chinese gloves, the thumb and little finger are way too long. Not worth returning due to 2-way shipping cost. Took over 10 days to get to me."
2,a disappointment,"This book purports to based on high quality research. If so, the author has not made a good comunication job of setting it forth. I found the book superficial. It was also looked through by a true scientist resident here and panned it badly. It's a good idea not well done in my opinion"
2,Doesn't last all day,Nice scent but it certainly doesn't do the job for me working all day. I'm gonna have to continue my search for an all natural deodorant that can hold it's own against the chemically gross ones.
1,Absolute waste of money,"This book is living proof that anything can get published. I own every fantasy baseball book out there. This is the worst by far. I'd love to be in a league with the guys above me who thought the book was good. It's redundant garbage. It would only be of use to someone brand new to the hobby. Sabino's ""ideas"" are nothing more than retreaded common sense. He shamelessly plugs Sports Illustrated and ignores the real sources for fantasy info, like Ron Shandler's site.All in all, I'm pissed off that I wasted my money on this garbage. If you want a good book on the subject, try Benson and Barron's Playing for Blood."
2,**did not fit**,"This book is aimed at a more traditional fantasy league. The league I am with allows a person to select a team from players throughout baseball history and does not involve a draft now the selection of a local commissioner. Although I did find parts of the text applicable, it just was not aimed at my league."
4,One Beautiful Day,This is one of the best Gospel Bluegrass I've found over the years. I still buy it for friends as a Christmas gift. Never grows old.
