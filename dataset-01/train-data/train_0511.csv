1,A long-winded piece of trash,This book came highly reccomended from many dependable book magazines but I thought this book was a complete disappointment. The writing is very long-winded and many of the supposedly-moving scenes appear inane and unrealistic. The use of unnecessarily big words does not help to ease the fatigue one gets from reading this book. 'Cold Mountain' takes itself all too seriously. The result-- a heavy-going piece of trash.
5,I rarely give 5 stars...,"I chose to read this book like I choose to sneak a bowl of ice cream late at night; a sort of guilty pleasure. I was not disappointed. I found the story compelling and the characters engaging. I finished in half the time I expected, as I found myself sneaking away from life to indulge. I enjoyed it as much as anything I've ever read from Hemingway, and in much the same way.I listened to this one (from Audible), and while many complained at the author's reading of his own book I couldn't imagine a better way to experience it. As someone raised in the rocky mountains, for three days I found myself describing the world around me in Charles Frazier's twangy, metered, and gentle southern voice."
2,Go See The Movie,"I started this book 3 times before I (FINALLY!) made it all the way through. With all due respect to Charles Frazier (writing anything is difficult), I did not like the book. Inman can't seem to make it home no matter what he does - in fact, he travels in reverse! Will he NEVER get there? Have you ever heard of quotation marks when someone speaks in a book?!? Of course the ending is depressing, can't have anything but that in ""modern"" fiction.I heard the movie was ""great!"" Go see it and save your time."
5,A matter of discovery--,"Charles Frazier has penned a book which reminds me why I like to read--it all comes down to a matter of discovery. Innumerable realizations--often major truths--abound. Page by page, line by line, a keen, honest observation of nature and humanity emerges, shimmering, dark, immense. Frazier's command of precise language--with economy when best serving his purpose, with expanse when most needed--reacquaints the reader with the beauty of words in the right hands. I offer Mr. Frazier what I consider the supreme compliment: his work enlightens."
4,mocking bird,i found that this story was a beautiful balance of war and peace. how the charcter has to over come the horrors of war to be at paece with the world.
1,Want to get depressed?,"If this book hadn't been given to me from a friend who wanted to know what I thought of it, I would have stopped reading after 50 pages. Yes, the book is well written, but on almost every page there is only hardship and bad luck. Every character in this book is fighting against something all the time. I couldn't believe it. And I just KNEW what the ending would be after the first few chapters. Yes, life can be tragic, but it's not this kind of struggle and I simply can't believe that during the Civil War every single day was so bad. I get enough bad news in my own life; why do I need to read about other's here?"
1,From a great start it's all down hill.,"If you like Ken Burns version of American history, or wish to know the value of a plot outline this book is for you."
1,Would you like to go to sleep?,"The only reason why i kept this reading this book, is because i was hoping it would get better or interesting. This book had me very conceived. The characters were boring and not well written. Regardless that this book was written very well in language, but on the other hand, the story line was very stupid. At night or even during the day, i tried to keep my eyes open to read it, but the plot, theme, or whatever you want to call it, just made me fall asleep. My suggestion is to whoever is reading this, buy the cliff notes, and save yourself the time of reading this novel"
1,Thoroughly Boring--Better Reads on this Subject Elsewhere,"I'm a lover of both good literature and words but this book left me with nothing but confusion as to why something like this would get so much attention, praise and awards and novels like Lee Smith's Fair and Tender Ladies are not as well-known but superior in all aspects. If you want to read about the mountains and if you want characters and writing that truly touch the soul, check out her books, available on Amazon, and leave this one behind."
4,4 stars for a tragedy..,"This is one of the masterpieces of historical novel but if you don't like tragedy do not read it. I rated it 4 stars for the effort of the Mr. Frazier to lyrically wrote it. The missing 1 star is for the most unexpected tragic ending. I was very disappointed with the bitter and heartbreaking way this book ends. If you are sort of people who can't bear unhappy endings please don't purchase this book. I tell you true, the ending spoils everything beautiful in previous chapters. But if you are seeking a book with rich descriptive and expressive writing this book will do it."
3,Slow with no Flow,"The story behind the book was very good. I love the hidden romance behind the whole war scene. The book itself was boring and drug out, with too much description. There were chunks of exciting parts that made you accually want to pick the book up. After that there could be 50 pages that have nothing scignificant in them what so ever. The story was good but all the description, well... enough is enough."
4,"Sometimes spectacularly vivid, other times overdone","A story about Inman, a southern soldier in the American civil war walking home across the southeast towards Ada, his love, among the dangers of war and desertion. The book is rife with description of the nineteenth century American landscape, sometimes spectacularly vivid and other times overdone. Using only sparse dialogue, Frazier creatures a beautiful love story of two individuals looking for survival and love amidst the turmoil of war."
2,MEDIOCRE,"I read this book, it was okay but the story flashed back to much, and I couldn't folow all of it but I read all of it anyway. I wouldn't recommend it. TOO SLOW MOVING, and BORING because of the flashbacks. The movie was the same way."
3,"I found this disappointing, after hearing all the buzz.","Perhaps I had heard too much about this novel, but I found the actual reading of it to be extremely anti-climatic. I love reading, and have a master's degree in literature, but for some reason, this story did not engage me in the slightest. Inman does travel a long distance from a war, but that is the only comparison to The Odyssey that could ever be drawn, in my opinion. Both Ada and Inman read as extremely cold characters, and the whole story lacked the passion of The Odyssey. My boyfriend also felt the same way--perhaps we are the only two people who did not enjoy this book! The plot is fine, but the characters are not compelling. I would never recommend this book to anyone, but it's perfectly adequate, if boring, reading."
1,"Oh, my . . . I can't believe I read the whole thing!!!","I happen to live about 40 miles from the actual ""Cold Mountain"" (on the Tennessee side of the NC/TN state line) very near the Pigeon River mentioned in the book. The descriptions of the flora and fauna, the terrain, climate, etc., was real and very well done. However, this book was the most slow and tedious, slow and tedious, slow and tedious, slow and tedious, slow and tedious, slow and tedious read imaginable. The writing style-no quote marks, no italics, no indication of rising excitement, etc., made this book flat, flat, flat. My husband (who, unlike me does not have dyslexia and can read very fast) also found it very taxing and tedious! There was a lot of useless verbiage to fill out the 360 pages of a 25 page story.Jeanne M. Daniels, Hartford, Tennessee"
2,PASS THE PROZAC!,"Why are books about life in the Southern USA almost always so depressing? Are they still in a funk about losing the war? They need to get over it!Reading this book is like wading through a vat of taffy--slow, and laborious, with no point. If I want to be depressed reading about the south, I'll read Faulkner's LIGHT IN AUGUST. At least it's a classic."
4,Brilliant,"A great work of literature that is unforgettable and haunting. I just finished reading it for the first time and can't wait to start again. There are so many memorable things about this book, and so many moments of profound sadness. Not to be missed!"
4,The tape edition was outstanding...,"The reader on the tape editon was wonderful. His slow reading added to the beautiful writing. He captured the southern writing and life. I don't think I would have finished reading this book, had I picked up the hardback. I realize some people think listening to the book is cheating, and in some cases I get shortchanged, but I believe in this case, I got the better end of the stick."
2,"Sad book, hard to follow as so gloomy","Not my favorite book, I have lived in the South and feel it was a put down to great people."
5,Writers-Sit down with Cold Mountain,"Cold Mountain, dense and epic, is the novel of 1999 which I hold closest to my heart. As an aspiring writer, I let this book take my perception of nature, of American history, of romance and war to a new level. I read Cold Mountain in bed at night and on the job (!) for many weeks; for as you may find, the depth of his descriptive ability is lost in a quick skim. For the reviewers who didn't get it, I ask that they read it again, put some effort into this novel; try to visualize Inman walking down the road, feel his desire to get home and find his love. Give it a chance!"
1,I'm glad that's over with,"Reading has taken up more of my time as I continue my life as an educated unemployed american. I had the misfortune of taking up my time reading this ""novel"". I can't say that I am educated enought to care what the difference between a novel and a good story is, but I can say this book was not well. I don't really care how much Frazier knows about the civil war era, his use of their vernacular, however that's spelled, is annoying at best. The conclusion is trite and very un-surprising. If you liked 20000 leagues under the Sea, you'll like Cold Mountain; a bunch of meaningless events occur and then it ends. No one learns anything - that is unless you didn't know war is bad - and the characters have serious flaws. Unless you are a 12-year-old girl, take my advice, don't read this book."
1,Agreed - agonizing and tedious,"Not too mention endless. This book went on and on and on and on until it climaxed, if you could call it that, with a disappointing ending. Don't waste your time - there are too many other good books out there waiting to be read."
3,The longest journey in the world.,"I had high expectations based on the reviews, but let me tell you, I kept reading out of sure will-power to stick with it. This was the LONGEST journey in the world. While I suppose that all of the detail was good for helping me to understand life during that period of time, it bogged down what story there was and at the end, left me asking both myself and Inman, was it really worth it?"
3,A well written dull story,Fraziers prose is well written story but not a very interesting story to go with the prose. This book was nothing more to me than several short storys linked by Inman wandering through the woods and mountains and none of them moved me.
2,Overpraised and Overbaked,"When a book has been preceded by such an armful of critical and popular kudos, it is not unreasonable to expect something special. What comes as no surprise after the fact is that the majority of this was hype; either that, or the state of the novel in America is in a sorrier state than I thought. Dull, predictable, with a metronomic structure of ""his chapter/her chapter"", I couldn't wait for it to end. I admired the skill in getting the language right and all the research it must have required (hence my extra star) but as a work of imagination, power or even entertainment it is severely lacking. Interesting for a first novel but little more. Be warned..."
2,cold mountain not a book for everyone!!!,"Cold Mountain was not a novel for everyone!!! It was too drawn out, had too much detail about things that were not important. The charaters were not developed, and the book took forever to get to one point. In my opinion, romantic and war novels do not mix. I only read it because ny teacher made me.But on a good note, Frazier had alot of good ideas. He just has to find a better way to express them."
2,it's not that good of a book to waist your time on.,"Cold Moutain is way too complicated to understand.It seems like a book for people with a very high I.Q.and a high rate of intelligence to understanding and analyzing difficult novels. The book is way too boring to keep my attention but for some srange reason it did for awhile.The author, Charles Frazier, dragged on into too much detail, telling unnecessary things that had no sense.I think the book, chronologically, stunk because i lost my place more than once trying to keep up to where the next setting, and plot were heading. From the looks of what type of problems his characters faceed, the author was probably a problem child with these expierences. I have not read the final chapters, but i'm not really looking forward to it. It stunk! Overall, I think Siskel and Ebert would give this book a negative review, but since that's not a option, and they're in a good mood and so am I, I'll give it a 2 star, for effort."
3,"Mostly credible, some gross errors","The descriptions of places and customs of the time are mostly very accurate and convincing. Bears do not, however, jump over cliffs.... The best part of the book is found in the small incidents along the way and in the relationship of Ada and Ruby."
3,You had better enjoy nature.,"I'm not sure what to make of this work. I certainly appreciate portions of it, but I didn't particularly like it. Its heavy with long descriptions of natural landscape, animals, and squalor, but rather short on society, history, and manners. One should take note of the title: Cold Mountain. This book is about the land, and the struggle of those little men and women who live on it. The main character, however, is always the land. Frazier's writing is interesting, though some of his metaphors seem a bit strained. I found the author's obsession with squalor, insalubrity, and poverty to be oppressive. The image he paints for us is damn ugly and, though obviously intended to approach realism, a bit exaggerated. The story is raw. The salon life of ante-bellum Richmond is nowhere to be found here. Read this book for the richness of it's natural description, not for social or historical insight."
5,Real life isn't all happy or sad.,"This book is a fabulous reading experience. The Civil War (or any war, for that matter) is so much more than who shot whom, when, and where. War CHANGES people, but there are some things that don't change even in the context of the most insurmountable odds, and to understand that is to ""get"" the point of this story. The ending stunned me to the extent that even days later I found myself forgetting that I hadn't read it and wanting to finish it to see how it turns out. Then I would remember - and my reaction was a bit like what Ada's might have been even during the time of the last scene in the book."
4,Great American Novel?,"I liked this book a lot. I thought it was beautifully written and very moving, and the ending was certainly heartbreaking. I didn't, however, think that this book is the greatest thing to hit the shelves since The Bible -- an opinion in which I differ from many people. It seems to me that many are aching to put Cold Mountain as the Great American Novel. I just didn't find it as groundbreaking or momentous as others seem to have -- it was a superbly written war story, perhaps even one of the best Civil War novels I've read -- but the Great American Novel? It wasn't THAT good."
1,Agonizingly Tedious.,Individuals are obviously polarized regarding Cold Mountain. Reading it was as boring a chore as I've encountered in a long while with no redemption at this novel's end. Perhaps the movie is better; one can only hope.
3,Cold Feelings from the Mountain,"I was a little disapointed in this National Book Award winner. Overall the story was simple, but interesting. I was extremely put off by the grisly images of slaughter that seemed to occur every ten pages (or less). I think that Frazier could have accomplished his novel without having to go into such gory details of how a goat, pig, chicken, turkey, bear, bull, and person are killed. I know that this time period calls for this sort of relevance, but it really detracted from the novel. I found myself feeling ill and skipping whole pages to avoid having to read about ""festering entrails."""
5,A Grand Classic!,"I've read this book 4 times. It's an absolutely wonderful piece of writing, the equivalent of Moby Dick, and a book destined to become an American Classic. It is a ""dark"" book but with beams of light all through it. I've read some of the negative comments in the reviews,,,and all I can say is that I'm mystified. They're either jealous of Frazer's writing, or are judging the book by it's dark subject. I suggest they read the ""Chicken Soup"" books if they judge a book by the smiley face quotient."
2,Long and boring,"I know this book received lots of critical accolades, and I consider myself a learned, well-read person - but I could not get through this story. I have owned the book since 1997, tried to read it 3 or 4 times, and never got past the first chapter. I finally forced myself to read it prior to the movie coming out, and I could barely finish it. Nothing happens! A guy walks away from a hospital and heads home, while a woman he barely knows tries to scrape together an existence during the Civil War. It is inconceivable to me that, even during a more innocent time, anyone could or would sustain enough passion for 4 years to have him make the long trek home based on a total of ""100 words"" spoken to each other (actually, the ""100 words"" comment may be from the movie, not the book.) I really wanted to like this (and actually liked the movie), but, unfortunately I thought the book was awful."
2,This Book makes you want to vomit,"I think this book was in between good and it [ ]. I like the way they had so much description in each chapter. I didn't like the way the author had Inman walking from the hospital all the way back to Cold Mountain to find Ada. I think that the novel is to romatic. I would recommend this book to people who like love stories. The plot was excellent. I like the way the author threw in hidden tricks. Especially the end, when Inman >>>>>. Them 9 years later, there are 8 plates, 3boys, Ruby, Stobrod, Ada, Reid and a 9 year old girl. Who is she? AHHHHHHHA. I think the epilogue could of been alot better."
2,Horrible!!!,Cold Mountain is possibly the most pointless novel I have ever read. The ending was fanominal but besides that... it stunk. Between all the walking and farming in the novel- I lost the whole point! The author also uses TOO MUCH DETAIL!! It is so boring that you end up reading the same sentence 47 times before you realize you aren't getting anywhere (kind of like Inman in some parts). So if your interested in all the particulars of a maple leaf- then this book is for you. If not... don't bother.I don't understand how the end of the novel could be so good and the rest of the book could be so bad. So here's my advice- read only the last 3 chapters. I promise- you're not missing much!
4,"""Cold Mountain"" leaves me in the cold","The book is a very good read. In fact, having grown up in that region of the South, Frazier's descriptions of things Southern brought back memories and gave my senses a fond tour through my childhood.BUT, I have one question for anyone who has also read this book... in the end (the epilogue) is Inman, alive or dead?"
4,"Beautiful writing, marred slightly by the ending","For the sheer pleasure of gorgeous writing, nothing I've read recently can top ""Cold Mountain."" With exquisite care and careful choosing of his words, Charles Frazier recreates the Civil War-era Smoky Mountains and its people so vividly you are transported in time to walk beside Inman on his journey home, or to help Ada and Ruby make a go of the farm. It is not a cheerful book, but the Civil War was not a cheerful time. My only quibble was with the pat made-for-the-movies ending. If the reader can overlook that, he/she will be rewarded. This is one of the rare books to be savored over a long rainy weekend. And sorry, naysayers, it does deserve all of its awards."
3,Poor ending spoils a great story,"After a wonderful journey through difficult situations, the story has an abrupt, unclear conclusion. More effort could have (and should have) gone into writing an ending that clearly explains the author's intent. I've read many books and stories that were better able to convey what was meant. Had to read the last few pages several times to try to understand the author's meaning. That isn't good writing."
1,BORRRRRRR-ING!,"Talk about a labor of bore! This book was horrific. It is so bloody slow. I have no idea how it won so many awards because it is nothing more than a 356 page descriptive paragraph. If you're in jail, by all means, indulge yourself. If you have a life, don't waste it on this overhyped recycling fodder."
1,Terrible Book,"This book was just one of the slowest books you will ever read. It drags out everything, and puts to much importance into things that don't matter to the book at all. If you like books don't read this one"
3,Hmmm,"I think I was almost as glad as Inman when he finally reached the end of his journey. Especially after he shot the bear cub (motivation?). While the writing is beautiful, there is a lot of static description, so that one gets a clearer image of the landscape than of Inman himself. His relationship with Ada appears tepid and comes across as a device/excuse for Inman's odyssey; the author seems more concerned with describing the picturesque characters Inman encounters along the way. The references to the Civil War, however, are stirring in their apparent realism. As with ""Doctor Zivago"" and ""The English Patient,"" perhaps the screen version will extrapolate more of a plot than was found in the novel? Try THE BLACK FLOWER by Howard Bahr for civil war fiction."
2,"Long, detailed, and romantic","The author utilizes many pages in developing very detailed images of the trials and tribulations of the main characters. I was not captured by the emotional and love interests of the characters for each other by their expressed thoughts during the book. While on a positive note, the conclusion captures the reader with a story which is quick moving, active and romantic."
2,"Good story, not well written.","Yes, it's a good story, echoing many similar stories to be found in the south. My wife's family has such a story of a family member, wounded during the civil war, walking back home, many miles and hardships, but with a happier ending. The writing, however, has too many factual errors, and the language is strange: not always modern, but never 1860s, with some regional expressions, but not consistent. Then the author is in love with two words, modal and seamless, used way too many times, even if they had been appropriate. I expected to come across proactive, too."
2,Painful Detail,"The topic is good, although I could not understand why the author chose to be so exhaustive in describing the surroundings, atmosphere, mood, and every possible occurrence. I found the detail to be waistful and bothersome, and took away from a possibly good story."
5,Modern day classic,This book is a modern day classic that should be required in English AP classes. Mr. Fraiser has created a great novel with a structure similar to Canteberry Tales or The Odyssey. The way his prose seems to flow in fascinating sentences and the emotions he evokes prompts me to highly recommend it.
2,Excuse me...what/where's your point?,I guess you had to have been there. No pot of gold at the end of this one.
2,depressing and pointless,"It is slow to start and goes downhill from there. I read on and finished it only because the reviews had been so good. I kept thinking that it would get better, but in the end it was very disappointing and unsatisfying. The reviews were misleading and I'll never again buy books that those reviewers recommend."
5,Destined to become one of my top 10 favorites!,"This was a wonderful read, right to the last page. When I was finished, I couldn't wait to share it with friends, but as I sat there holding Cold Mountain, I wasn't at all sure that I was going to be able to phyiscally part with this book for quite awhile. Not many books have made me feel that way. I loved it, start to finish!"
2,Rewriting Cival War History?,"It was fun to see what that kooky preacher Veasey would do next, but I was a little put off about the discriptions of the Confederate Generals on Maryes Heights. The authors agenda was to make them look like war mongering asses who thought of the men more as chess game pieces than soliders. ""The two generals spent the afternoon up on the hill coining fine phrases like a couple of wags."" I guess Mr. Frazier is more of a CW expert than Catton, Gallager, Robertson, Sears, Headley, etc..."
4,Beautifully written; Couldn't put it down,"This book was so well-written - the way novels used to be written. It definitely qualifies as literature. The author's talent for writing elaborate descriptions made me feel like I was there in the middle of all the hardship and struggle. If you like historical novels, this one is for you."
3,The novel lasts almost as long as the war itself!,"Reading Cold Mountain was an exhausting exercise in self-discipline made none the easier by the fact that the author does not uses conventional puctuation for dialogue. This makes for densely written text with little white space for the reader to rest her eyes.While the descriptive language is beautifully written, I found the forward action of the story achingly slow. Would these two oddly matched lovers ever connect?"
2,Boring!,"When I started this book on the beach, a man came up to me and said ""This is the most boring book I've ever read, he's walking, she's learning about herself, he's walking, she's learning, he's walking, it was so awful I couldn't finish it"" and I was like ""Whatever buddy, I'm reading here"". Meanwhile, 6 months later I thought to myself his guy was right on the money, he's walking, she's learning... BORING. I think maybe if the author hadn't drawn it on and on for so long, then I would have liked the book more.Also, the no quotes thing made it very hard to understand when someone was talking, which was very irritating."
5,GREAT BOOK. INTERESTING REACTIONS FROM READERS.,"I logged on to read the reviews out of curiosity and am bewildered by what I find. Seems like it's either love or hate for the book. I'm in the ""love it"" camp, although I am only half-way through the story and haven't had the chance to experience the much discussed ending. I have, however, enjoyed EVERY PAGE so far. It seems very reasonable to me. The descriptions of the surroundings are so crisp that one feels as if one were truly present. Secondly, the stories are told in the best classical tradition that is as entertaining as a story by the campfire. Thirdly, the characters are interesting. To boot, there are many ideas in the book which I personally found to be thought-provoking. It's been a comfort to my spirit to read Inman and Ada's journeys. I am amazed at the negative comments some readers have. Too boring to finish? Too violent? Unnecessary vulgarity? I guess people really expect different things from a book."
5,This book actually took me to the battlefield.,"This book was absolutely one of the best I have ever read.You could smell the blood, dirt, and horid things that happened.You could view the lush landscape- it was all woven into a very moving story.This guy can really tell a story, I hope I'll be reading another real soon! I hated for Cold Mountain to end."
2,"overrated, slow moving litany of civil war times","I was quite disappointed after all the rave reviews, including a few of my colleagues who liked the book----I skimmed the last 100 pages just to convince myself that I wasn't missing the good part---there never was a good part for me; A good friend of mine just started reading it this week, and had the same impression; she is not going to finish it"
2,Yuck,"I read this book on the recommendation of friend I trust. She loved it. I hated it. It has Oprah Book Club written all over it, and by that I mean books which try to sell you mundane and commonplace happenings as Great Thoughts. It's The Bridges of Madison County all over again. I just don't get it. And don't think it's because I'm not smart enough. I'm a historian by trade and I can tell you--this book is bad.I could go on and on about how poorly written and how contrived it is, but the thing I find most disturbing about it is his treatment of women. Ada goes from an intellectual to a farm wife, learning what the Really Important things in life are: cooking, cleaning, and working in the fields. Such a lovely view of women. I feel sorry for Mr. Frasier's female counterparts in his academic department."
4,GOLDFISH DON'T BOUNCE,"Eyecatching summary,yes? directions-1. read slowly when you have LOTS of time2. read to capture the poetry. (very important). I must say, anyone who can make the civil war poetic deserves some credit. Even though the beginning started slow, i didn't find myself rushing through the sentances. The combination of words was just...nice to read. But the pace... maybe your goldfish...."
3,A lot better than I had thought!,When I began reading this book it was very slow. I'm 17 years old and it takes a lot to keep my attention. This book is more than just another War novel it's about love and much more. Definitely read it and review it yourself.
2,What was my Honors English Profesor thinking??,"The truth is that I only read the book because it was assigned to me. Before I began reading I believed that it was going to be a really good novel and love story. But as I was midway through the book I was disilusioned by the slow pace of the book. I said to myself to keep reading despite that because maybe the compensation would come later through a really wonderful ending. This never happened. How can you end the book so abruply in a few pages after having read 350 pages. It just does'nt make sense. In addition I believe that Ada would not have accepted Inman back she did'nt need him, she was her own person. As for this being a ""love story"", I disagree. They never really expressed any love towards each other, only lust. In conclusion, I believe that it was'nt a terribly bad novel but I am sure that he could have done a much better job in finishing the story."
2,A waste of valuable paper,"""Cold Mountain"" began slow and didn't get any better. Though I enjoyed the section describing the Goat Woman, I would have to say this is the only section worth reading. I also the ending is ambiguous. It appears the author simply got tired of writing and just ended his story with no focus."
2,Is that all there is?,"How can Mr. Frazier craft his words so well yet say so little for so long about nothing. My expectations ran high after reading endless reviews of praise for Mr. Frazier's first novel, however, after plodding through the first 100 pages, it occurred to me that it is difficult to like a book when you simply don't like any of the characters. Ada is weak albeit much more interesting than Inman, but where is the late night, can't put down page turner I was anticipating? I cannot understand all the critical acclaim for this vapid piece of work, but I guess that's why there's chocolate and vanilla. I would not recommend this as a great read, a good read or even an okay read but a ""read at your own risk"" type of read. Buyer beware!"
5,The best book I have read in a very long time!,"The smell of the wet leaves, the taste of cornmeal mush, the chill of a North Carolina autumn dusk, the sight of a scarecrow wearing a mauve dress. I felt that I was there. I felt lonely, hungry, tired, hot, cold, in pain, and in great sorrow. And, for a fleeting moment, happy."
1,cold mountain left me cold,After all the hype I was very disappointed when I began to read this slow moving book. I soldiered on in the hope it would improve but I was even more disappointed. It was extremely pretentious and I cringed all the time I was reading - real people are not like the characters in this book. (I hate these super cool characters - their only place is in second rate fiction)Please do not waste your time reading this book and if you do please don't pretend to agree with all its admirers.- I'm sure none of the critics wanted to be the first to admit how badly written it was.
1,Awful.,"I had high expectations for this book after all the hype, but once again, reviews and accolades mean very little. The characters are unlikeable and uninteresting, the plot is predictable, the events are ridiculous, and the writing is tepid and formulaic. I gave up after about 100 pages. Don't waste your time and money, not when there are so many truly wonderful books out there to read."
1,Adds a New Dimension to the word BORING,"By the time I got two-thirds of the way through this book, I couldn't have cared less what happened to Inman and Ada. The story just goes nowhere. After each chapter, I'd put the book down and ask myself, ""How on earth did this guy get this thing published?"" It's an embarrassment what some publishers will stoop to. Don't waste your time."
1,too pretentious,The author seems to be too busy trying to write beautifully to also tell a gripping story. I couldn't get through the first chapter and then got rid of the book.
2,"1990's characters in a ""historical"" setting","For the life of me, I can't see why so many people liked this book (which is why I read it in the first place). The author and characters are SO out of place with their times; the proto-lesbian relationship, the omnipotent secret-police NKVD Home Guard units, the goofy protagonist.The author's writing style is warmed-over Cormack McCarthy. I know it's his first book, which is why I didn't give it 1 star, but it is not an impressive first effort.All I can figure is that this would be considered ""great literature"" by people who mostly read ""bodice rippers"" and are members of Oprah's book club."
1,Style triumphs over Substance,"I bought this book after reading kudos and praises for it from many sources. I believe now that these literary critics love the style of the book, whereas most people read books for substance. Some of his ""style"", like not using quotation marks, annoyed and distracted from my enjoyment of the story.He did obviously know a great deal about the time period he was writing about, but his plot line was predictable and pure formula. The final showdown, if not the depressing results, was obvious from the midpoint of the book."
1,An absolute load of bollocksing cobblers,"A long-winded, hokey, patronising, unappealing, boring and unlikely tome - and I'm only half-way through it!Thanks to those readers who have flagged the unhappy ending - I couldn't bear a 'happily ever after'!"
1,"horrible; this year's ""midnight in the garden of good ....""","The publishing industry dupes us yet again. One of those books that you have to get because of all the attention, and then when finished you continue to recommend it because you're too embarrassed to admit you were duped! This was the literature equivalent of the film ""The Piano"". If you liked that picture you'll love this book. Just do the rest of us a favor and keep your opinions to yourself."
4,I'd say three and three quarters but they wont let me.,"I feel it is a great story worthy of reading if someone is intersted. My only problem with it was with the way it was written. By that i mean the style alone. I think that the author often times chose the most awkward way of writing what he wanted to get a point across. Though then again, i sure didnt make a bunch of money off an award-winning book, so what do I know. I just thougt i'd mention that weak point because I'm used to authors that have words that flow like Ray Bradbury, mike connely, and (please forgive me for forgetting the author's name, my mind is weary)the author of The Catcher in the Rye. It's sad that his name escapes me.Overall this novel was a nice and different look on the civil war era. I feel the story of Inman and his personal growth is intriqueing and intuitive."
4,"I liked it, but can understand if others don't","I liked it because I found it interesting who Inman meets on his journey back from the war to home in western North Carolina. Look forward to seeing the movie. But I can understand why the average person would be annoyed and impatient with it. It is really deep, descriptive reading"
4,Renewal and Beauty,"The theme of renewal pervades this wonderful novel, which tells the story of a Confederate soldier walking across North Carolina from a hospital near Raleigh, to his home and his sweetheart on Cold Mountain in the far west of the state. The novel also tells the story of that sweetheart, Ada, and her struggle to maintain her family's farm. Frazier uses stories from his own family's history to spin a tale of renewal and rebirth: the renewal of a farm, the crushing and rebirth of a man's spirit, and ultimately the renewal and rebirth of a nation. Frazier's great triumph is his use of language. He bathes the reader in sensual images and evokes the simplicity, roughness, and cruelty of backwoods life before the age of technology. This book is a must-read for anyone with an interest in American history or who appreciates how beautiful the English language truly can be."
2,Grass Grows Slowly On This Side,"This book has a good story line which could be much better than it is. Fraizer writes a novel with great imagery. Inman's journey across the embattled south is an epic one. However, the book's biggest detractor is the slowness of the plot at times. Some parts of the book are quite entertaining and just wish to be finished whilst others feel laborious to finish. If you are a person who is fascinated with the Civil War Era this book is for you. If you are the kind of person that looks for a book which is full of excitement and is nearly impossible to put down, you will be dissapointed by this one. Its underlying plot is of excellent caliber but it is the slowness of some parts of this book that keep it from being as good as it could potentially be."
4,Outstanding Work by Frazier,"Charles Frazier not only wrote the book, he narrates on this audio version. The richly described fabric of his tale tells the story of a young man returning from the battlegrounds of the Civil War to the life - and love - that he left behind, and the woman herself, who, during the story, is in the process of learning the hardships of war and reconstruction. I was mesmerized by the detail of the storywriting in the unabridged version, and rarely found it too comprehensive. I actually began to think like the characters. The last time this happened in a book was with Lonesome Dove, by Larry McMurtry. This was a pure joy."
4,good book - I recommend it,"Despite the somewhat slow pace and myriad use of minute and detailed descriptions, I found this to be a rich story and a very moving tale and I was sorry when the novel was over. The author's reading of his novel in this audiobook was one of the best I've ever heard. I couldn't help but keep listening to find out what would happen next in Inman's adventurous journey home and to find out how Ada and Ruby were getting along on the farm. Someday when I have time, I hope to read the book in print."
4,Not much of an ending,Twelfth Night is a mature comedy. It is not very romantic as some people may have it. It was fun to read based on the fool Sir Andrew and the identity mix up between Viola-Cesario and Sebastian along side with who would end up with who. The ending however was lacking I was hopimg for more
3,what you will is right,"like 'as you like it', i watched two versions of 'twelfth night' and didn't think much of it. the main love story between orsino and viola was ininspired - it made me yawn. the only humor in the play comes from the secondary story of sir toby and his clownish friends, espcially malvolio, the conceited butler. yellow garters! that was a hoot. but viola and orsino? no. especially orsino, who is a wimp and no match for viola. viola herself, while a pretty good female character, is no rosalind. and so it goes. i need to read this play to see what the fuss is about. but based on two viewings, i can't rate this any better than 3 stars."
1,This is what makes me angry with Amazon,"Classics are out there in the public domain and can be obtained hundreds, if not thousands, of places. When I buy one for my Kindle I want content unavailable elsewhere. Why aren't footnotes and commentaries included as pop-ups in the Kindle editions of classics? I'm certainly willing to pay for that feature. If Kindle is going to be a real and attractive alternative to paper copies, it should live up to the promise. Pop-up definitions are a minimal beginning. Get it together, Amazon. Give me a reason to choose the Kindle edition over the hard copy. So far, your haven't."
4,A Good Book,"I thought that this was a good book and the only reason that I gave it 4 stars was because it was so hard to understand. It is a great story about love and disguises, and it is also very funny."
3,Pleasantly Funny,"Although this comedy lacks the hilarious tone of ""The Comedy of Errors"" or the superb construction of ""Much Ado About Nothing,"" it is still a pretty good play. The play begins seriously enough when after an accident at sea, Viola is looking for her lost brother. She disuises herself as a man and offers her service to Orsino. The humour is well drawn when Olivia falls in love with Viola's male disguise. Also, there is some strong comedy when Viola makes some characters angry and her brother Sebastian (who resembles Viola's male identity) suffers the consequences. But the play also has some really touching moments. Viola as a man faces the hard task of assisting Orsino in his persuit of Olivia, even though she wants Orsino for herself. Shakespeare ofcourse manages to resolve everything and offer us a happy ending. If you read this, knowing not to expect Shakespeare's best, you will probably find this very pleasant."
2,Interesting photos but no vision or context,"This is the third volume of photos in author Chinnery's series on the Davis-Monthan 'boneyard.' This volume distinguishes itself by making a passing attempt at providing history and context about the place. This is done by including some archival photos and a tantalizingly brief narrative that could have been extracted from an extant document produced at the facility. Beyond that the reader is presented with, again, another view into what appears to be the author's photo collection."
5,A troubling yet important read,"This book explains in startling detail the explanation of the eugenics policies of the Third Reich. While many believe Hitler's racial policies were of his own design, it simply isn't so. Eugenics, Antisemitism, and anti-Tziganism enjoyed a long and unhindered career long before Hitler came to power. This study brings insight into an already problematic and misunderstood event known to many as The Holocaust and shows the reader how misguided science in the hands of ignorant people may be used for great evil,"
4,Overall a good compilation,"This is a good compilation of the two albums that Illusion put out. I actually like songs from both albums, although the first album has overall better songs with production that is not quite as good. The second album (beginning with Madonna Blue) is the reverse - great production with a mixed song selection. If you like Renaissance you'll like Illusion. Jane Relf's voice is definitely different from Annie's, however I really like it. It certainly improved miles from the very first Renaissance album. A good collection."
1,somethingsgotagive,"It's re-production was done with the poorest of methods. Bad sound, and fidelity...the cost for the CD considering the quality was a joke. $25.00 for garbage!"
4,Pretty good!!!,"I haven't bought this item yet, but I've heard it, and I really like it. The main track, Biology, is catchy and was the first Girls Aloud song I heard. They're addictive, aren't they!? Anywho, I noticed a B-side, Nobody But You, which I listen to contstantly on youtube, and I love it. Its a slow song, but still within their style, and not a ballad. I also found the Tony Lemezma Remix, which is a new spin on a good song. Hearing a new melody makes the girls' vocals stand out, like hearing it again for the first time. It totally comes recommended if you enjoy Girls Aloud."
5,good idea book,"I too am a graphic design student and found this to be helpful in formulating a stylish, clean look for my own stationary set. There's a good mix of wild and conservative ideas and diverse styles. A bit of history, case studies briefs, all photograph examples, and of interesting photo layouts, and international clients help make this book a fullfilling quick read."
3,rockihn roll is knackish,"I remember the summer of 81 and the radio played smmoth songs to get you through those dog days.A man who has been around since the seventies made a rocking album.Every song is good from Valerie straight down to When the music starts.Although he sounded a little rough around the UH'S during the Breakup Song this is still nice to play as a remember when time.Although very commercial its great to play at parties or if you want to recapture those feelings of yesterday when you got the most out of your money buying CD'S.When an album has hits all the way through you don't feel like you were being ripped off.Now I know why people download songs,make a good album so we won't have to do it."
4,Another great one from one of the greatest Hawaiian artists,"One of Gabby's many great albums. Stick to the Hawaiian titles and you'll hear some great slack key and singing. He and the band do an especially wonderful job on ""Pu'uanahulu"" and ""E Nihi Ka Hele."" On the down side, he drags ""Ipo Lei Manu"" out a bit. Worth every penny."
3,First Time Pilates Video Buyer,"This is my first Pilates video I've purchased. I was torn as to which video to purchase. I needed something with lots of direction. I have reviewed this video prior to doing the excerise. I'm glad that I had the opportunity to do so. Upon reviewing the video you'll find that they provide an advance person, a begining person and an intermediate person. This is great so that once I become a pro a can step it up using the same video. The downer part is that on 2 moves the camera focused on the advance person and just before the move was ended they went to the beginner. That made it a little had trying to keep the same pace of a beginner. The live music is peacefull and pleasant. In all I enjoy the video and am glad that this was my video of choice to start off with. The instructor has great direction and a great voice that helps along the way."
2,"OK for low-power devices, but AC power needed for anything else","I bought this device last summer (and, in retrospect, paid a lot more than I should have) because my Thinkpad T30 doesn't have built-in USB 2.0, just USB 1.1. It works OK with low-power devices like scanners and flash drives. However, to run a high-power device (especially one that doesn't already have an AC power adapter of its own, such as Seagate's FreeAgent Go external hard drives), you need to obtain the AC power adapter (available separately) for this card. I don't know, myself, where to get one, so I'm going to find another USB PC Card that does have a power adapter included. Avoid unless you have power adapters on hand for all your high-power-using USB devices."
2,"handy, but doesn't seem to work very well","I got it to power my mouse, but nothing more. The listing does not mention that it requires external power to run pretty much anything. It comes with a power adapter that plugs into your other usb port (or you can buy an ac adapter separately). In any event, even with the power adapter plugged in to my existing usb 1.1 port, I could not get enough power to run a wireless 802.11g usb adapter through the dynex card--it turned on, but kept losing the signal. So now I've still got my wireless connection running on the slower usb 1.1 port. But if I ever need a place to plug in another mouse (which is the only thing I could get to run successfully through the dynex usb 2.0 port) then I suppose I'm all set."
5,Forever Jake,"Sexy, humorous and heart catching. A fun read that I couldn't put down. If Yukon men are all this sexy, then I'm expecting an exodus north at any minute."
5,"You feel delicious, all the time","This is my second bottle in 6 years. A little goes a long way, and the fragrance lasts for hours. It's not over powering, so enjoy. I like to use it alone or with other fragrances. Either way I always get complements on my perfume. I just feel delicious - all the time. Don't delay, you'll like it."
4,Wonderful Find,"Being unfamiliar with this Japanese (or, Japanese-American?) photographer I was delighted to come across his book while on a recent trip to New York. Much of it consists of architectural photographs, while other pictures focus on people on the street and at various interior locations. I found Yamawaki's style both sophisticated and inspiring. There isn't much that can be done in fine art photography that one could desribe as ""new"", but Yamawaki does bring a refreshing and idiosyncratically interesting style to his work. And, Steidl is to be commended for its wonderful presentation of Yamawaki's work. I'm becoming a huge fan of this publisher - especially in light of its reasonable prices. This book is highly recommended."
2,I didn't get it,"There are many people out there who obviously liked this book a great deal. I'm not one of them. I found Weltner's characters unsympathetic and the plot boring. Sorry -- I may be a ""Hoarder"", but I much prefer Amy Tan, Lydia Minotoya, and Joy Kogawa, all who wrestle with issues of multiculturalism without flattening the issues into flippant sound bites."
2,reinforces sterotypes,The jeist of Ms. Wongs story is that her protagonist is somehow able to transcend her own inherent predjudice against white people by ending up with a white boyfreind. This would come off as ironic if the protagonist was a bit more self aware but she's neurotic and self absorbed and essentially not cute..though shes trying to be. With the exception of the Grandmother (who is a gem) the characters of this 20 something story come off as too adolescent to be interesting to an adult reader.
3,Amusing but annoying at times for ABC women in their 20-30s.,"The book started off well, with great stories about being ABC, not being able to speak Chinese, and trying to figure out how to fit in as an American and hold on to the Chinese culture. Towards the end, the main character has some serious insecurity issues, and annoyingly paranoid about prejudice and what her family will perceive when she dates a caucasian guy. It's lightly entertaining, but the story became a bit disjointed, and I didn't feel the author achieved the potential of the material. I would advise anyone to buy this book used, it's not worth the retail price."
1,the worst book ever,"I bought this book thinking it would be interesting, especially since I thought I could relate and I live in the Bay Area. But this book, by far, is the worst book I have ever read. Half way through, I was ready to chuck it, but I wanted to see it through to the end. What a mistake!Lindsey is annoying, judgmental and actually rather racist herself. Who judges a person on their name and corduroy pants and assumes that he has an Asian fetish? As a fellow A-A woman, I can relate to a few things she goes through, but not to most. The narration is terrible and there are no characters that are truly likable. The story is vapid, choppy and flat out terrible. Don't waste your time on this one!"
2,Buy This Book For Kicks!,"I read The Dim Sum of All Things a few years ago and I still carry disdain for this book today. (A ""hoarder"" was actually taken by the cover and bought it for me.) I don't regret reading the self-absorbed Wong Keltner's story, though this was the first time I ever felt annoyed with an author and wanted to stop reading a book. I persevered, quite proud of myself, and realized this book is great to have when needing to reference a poorly crafted story. I am half-Asian and aware of the old ""hoarders"" that eye my sweet Asian mother, but I found myself rolling my eyes at the author's need to push this fact to her audience. We get it Wong Keltner! You are so quirkly Asian. Anglo men flock to you because the slant of your eyes! Seriously, I wouldn't want to reward such horrible story-telling, but buy this book to get your hate on or to balance your palate after reading the great Amy Tan."
3,"a fun, light read","I liked this book. As a young Asian American female who grew up in San Francisco, the setting for this book, the protagonist's experience struck a chord with me. Sure, maybe it doesn't aspire to high literary aspirations but nonetheless, it's smart, hip, and fun to read. I especially liked the way Keltner characterized the kooky aunts in the novel--they were laugh-out-loud funny and the hoarders of all things Asian. Keltner writes from the perspective of a girl in her mid-20's who's coming to terms with her Chinese heritage and a budding romance. If I were to criticize anything about the book, it would be that the story line could be stronger (what was the climax of the novel?) and that the chapter on her trip to China could be more developed."
3,Hit the nail on the head,"The thing that caught my attention was that this was an Asian woman writing about Asians. I know there are some authours out there, such as Amy Tan, but not many. While Amy Tan's books may be more culturally accurate they are also more dramatic. This book is lighter and a faster read; what I imagine Kelly Rippa might endorse.I did enjoy reading this book, especially about the hoarders. I can't imagine being an asian in the USA and not running into at least one hoarder. This book did have some very amusing moments and was certainly accurate on some occasion.I did however feel the book had added fluff in it that could have been omitted. I would agree with another reader that the pants at the part scene could have been left out. I didn't really understand why the author would have made the one character part Chinese and what man would take that much crap from some neurotic woman anyway.Overall I enjoyed the book and I would recommend it to my friends"
3,Twinkies unite!,"There was no doubt from the moment that I read the first page that this was going to be a description of my life. Keltner does capture the flavor of the ABC but there is also a lot of hostility in this book towards the ""American/caucasian folks"" for their little stereotypical behaviors. However, there are some very funny passages especially, the stinky medicinals that her grandmother keeps trying to smear on her (Oh, I remember those stinky goo moments as well.) and the smelly, bizarre concoctions often served at restaurants. So true. I think it could be enlightening and amusing for a summer beach read so I will give it a ""thumbs up."" But yes, as others have commented, the sexual innuendos are just a little too coy and maybe could just be left out altogether. I did like the ""hoarder of all things asian"" concept. That really made me laugh! I would recommend it to ABC's, ABK's and Twinkies as well as people interested in a view into our world."
3,NOT like Amy Tan but good,"ok, I have to take issue with another reviewer who said if you like Amy Tan you'll likle this. Frankly, Amy Tan is one of the best authors we have writing these days- literary and humane. That is not to say I didn't enjoy this book. There were a few laugh-out-loud scenes, including one that is over the top and even slightly gross.I didn't find this character that shallow. She is actually quite realistic for a 25 year old who is 'finding' herself. I also really liked the portrayal of the grandmother, my favorite character. The scewnes in China are very moving.The book mainly deals with being 2nd generaton Chinese-American in a family with divided feelings about their 'Chineseness.' It's a good topic but maybe the main problem with the book is that there is too much going on, not enough focus. I also found the author's style off putting. There are WAY too many desciptive words in a sentence. It makes for rather amateurish writing.But a fun, quick read."
2,I don't usually write reviews.....,".......but this book was so insipid that I had to warn other readers. I read the whole thing and I'd really like those 3 hours of my life back. It aspires to be ""chick-lit"" on the level of the Sophie Kinsella books, or ""Something Borrowed"" by Emily Giffin, but it has more in common with the dreaded ""Red Dress Ink"" books which I think should be avoided at all costs. The narrator is unlikable and inconsistent and the plot meanders to a maddening degree. I think she has some talent that could be developed further but this book is not a promising debut."
1,This book sucks,"She's a sellout. And who the hell came up with this little blurb in the book description??? ""Where Asian cuties meet the white guys who love them?"" Nah nah nah, i get enough asian man hatin' from maxine hong KINGSTON and amy tan. Welcome to the club, Kim Wong KELTNER, just another self-hater. Isn't there a 0 star option???"
2,Poor representation of young Chinese women,"I just finished this book tonight and i wasn't that wowed. It's had some fun sections but most of it was a little too much soul searching chinese while looking down upon white males who may like asian females. One major mistake in the book that bothers me is that the grandmother Pau Pau is named that. As being a fellow asain, i would think the author would know that title ""Pau Pau"" is for the father's mother not the mother's mother. I didn't notice it until i finished the book. Seeming to know alot about the chinese culture and living in SF, i would think the author would know the proper title of a grandmother on the mother's side is, Jia Pau, not Pau Pau! Also i love how the main character easy forgave her love interest when given a cheese hello kitty toaster oven. LAME!!"
2,First 12 pages great and then downhill,"the discussion of Hoarders had me laughing out loud, but then I realized the book slipped back into every ABC stereotype i'd ever heard,complete with inept and/or gay Chinese men no one wants, the self-loathing ""ethnic"" character, the money obsessed Asian...and others I don't have space to mention. Besides all that, the novel switches voice between 1st and 3rd person...I just wasn't impressed. It's a step above the romance novels I used to get at the 2nd hand store for a dime, but not filled with 3 dimensional characters, either."
2,I'm bummed that I bought the sequel and this book at the same time,"This was a nice, fast read and kept me awake during my commute but in NO way should be compared to Amy Tan.I found the cliches and overly descriptive scenarios very dull and annoying. Seemed to me that the author was trying too hard (as if overboard description makes for good writing).The character of Lindsey was shallow and ran away from anything remotely unsafe. She annoyed me also.I found the characters of Pau Pau and Michael were most endearing, though.I bought both ""The Dim Sum of All Things"" and ""Buddha Baby"" at the same time. ""Buddha Baby"" was very similar to ""Dim Sum"" and annoyed me for the exact same reasons."
5,That&#65533;s not a moon; it&#65533;s a book review.,"I really liked this book! It was a pleasure to read and I instantly cared for the protagonist. I easily related to the main character even though I'm not 20-something, a native San Franciscan, a woman, or from an ethnic background of anything other than predominantly WASP'y. The themes are universal and the author has an accessible yet very insightful style. Plus, I have to admit that I did always wonder what went on behind the closed doors of various mysterious looking Chinatown establishments - now I know. (Or at least I know to an extent similar to that of a fictitious first/basically-second generation Chinese-American who has a healthy mix of interest and distress in their historical roots.)"
1,Racist.,"I became disgusted by all the racist comments in the book and after about a hundred pages into the story,I started to put a check on each page that contained a racist comment.Especially about Caucasian men. Almost every page is marked.I believe that if this book had been written by a Caucasian or African American it would have started an outcry from the reading public. As it should."
1,Awful. Truly awful.,"Manages to be dull and angry simultaneously. To say that the book has only a single note would be kind, as most one-note books do a far better job of working through the various connotations of their subject matter than this one. Ms. Keltner's idea of approaching the Chinese-American experience seems to be to surround her nasty protagonist with an unending serious of poorly conceived characters whose only purpose seems to be to spout something implausible so said protagonist can have internal rants that come across as rather offensive as well. (""Loot Summer Palace long time ago! If foreign devil don't take, communists smash!""- this is supposed to be funny? Or insightful?) Lacking in humor, a lazy, inconsequential plot, and featuring a surprisingly sour edge to it, all wrapped up in thoroughly pedestrian prose.Steer clear."
1,Awful Book,"Contrived and with too many things that just do not ring true. Lindsey is Chinese-American, living in Chinatown, with her Chinese grandmother, grew up surrounded by Chinese relatives and yet is so clueless about basic, everyday things....? She is constantly having to have things ""explained"" to her (e.g. food, customs)by her brother, cousin, etc. It reads like a bad TV movie. She mistakes ""lion-dancing"" for ""line-dancing"" at a New Year celebration? Just silly."
2,She seems very self-hating,"This book was overly concerned with chinese-ness and with everything else in the world being opposed to chinese. The author hates men who admire chinese women, hates non-chinese who admire chinese art, fabric or food.The protagonist is so very self conscious that I never believed for a minute that she would actually let Michael close enough to see the ""real"" her. Also her anger at a column entitled ""The Slant"" as an anti-asian statement (toward her, no less) was ridiculous. She was a journalism major! Surely she could see outside of her ethnicity to understand the a ""slant"" is an individual view of an issue.Lindsey was offended at a non chinese having, using or admiring objects and people of chinese heritage. Lindsey's self-loathing of being chinese has dampened my admiration of the culture, art and people. How can I know if someone like Lindsey is scorning me for buying a gorgeous imported teapot from Costplus?"
1,Am I reading the same book?!,"This book was just awful. I've read other books by Kasey Michaels and have enjoyed them. This book reads like stereo instructions. I didn't even finish it (and this is coming from a person who actually sat through the entire movie, My Stepmother Is An Alien). I say spare yourself the torture (unless you have a sleep disorder) and pass on this one."
5,This story was put together really well,"The late Professor Quennel Quinton never had been the most affectionate of fathers. Nevertheless, his daughter Victoria is determined to find out who killed him. Her single clue: a valuable snuffbox bearing the initials ""P.S."" But making the acquaintance of the various wealthy gentlemen with the damning initials would necessitate becoming socially accepted. Not an easy task for a penniless orphan raised in a scholarly environment. Enter Patrick Sherbourne, a devilishly handsome lord, all too anxious to grace her entrance into society. With Patrick at her side, Victoria makes the acquaintance of three more ""P.S."" gentleman. But, much to her dismay, the evidence seems destined to point right in the direction of the irresistible lord who has completely captured her heart.This book is only 180 pages but still worth the effort to read it."
4,good service,"my product arrived quickly and the disc works well. the box was torn on the bottom, but it's not big deal. i would buy from this seller again."
5,The ultimate THRASH band!,"Onslaught was one of those bands from the '80s that will forever be engrained as masters of the death metal genre. Their first album ""Power From Hell"" was as vicious as anything that had been released up to that point--Sodom's ""In The Sign Of Evil"", Celtic Frost's ""Morbid Tales"" and Slayer's ""Hell Awaits"". ""Power From Hell"" was pure evil.....The second album ""The Force"" was more thrashy, but still 100% evil. Starting with the album cover (a pentagram) and with song titles such as ""Fight With The Beast"", ""Demoniac"", and the godly ""Let There Be Death"", how can anybody think that this was Stryper?If you claim to be a metalhead and are into '80s Death/Speed/Black/Thrash/HEAVY metal, GET THIS!Caution: May cause whiplash!!!"
1,"would have been better without the ignorant ""host""",I found the actual segments on the Icelandic horse beautiful but there were too many scenes with the host that were painful to watch. He seemed unprepared to understand the culture -- the worst part when he sidetracks from the horses to make fun of Icelanders' belief in hidden people. I was also disappointed in how little information was presented about the horses considering the length of the video. It came across as a slapdash and amateurish production.
2,A disappointment for sure.,"After Celtic Frost dissolved, Switzerland had little name for itself in Metal aside from Samael, formed in 1987. They began as a slower paced Black Metal outfit and slowly evolved with echo-like industrial atmospheres.In ""Reign of Light"" they go way beyond ... too beyond. The songs have a funky, uplifting feel to them and in a few Vorp/Vorphalack even attempts to rap! The album sounds so commercial and MTV-friendly I wouldn't be surprised if the song ""High Above"" ended up on the soundtrack of the next Vin Diesel/Angelina Jolie Sci-Fi movie. Had they limited production qualities by a few notches, as they did on other albums, this may have turned out OK, but ""sell-out"" is written in so many places it's too obvious even to take lightly.Listen to a few songs. If the new ""Prong-visits-India"" Samael doesn't sound appealing, listen to Ceremony of Opposites, Exodus, and even Eternal if you like dark symphonic black metal."
4,Good for fans of Samael,"This is a very good album. However, not all of the songs are winners. The best songs are Inch'Allah, On Earth, Telepath, Heliopolis, Telepathic. For some reason, the rest aren't that interesting. It's odd how Samael has a tendancy to make some great songs, and simultaneously make songs that somehow seem lifeless. The music on this album is at a medium tempo with plenty of keyboards. Some of the songs sound like they use Middle Eastern sounds, specifically Inch'Allah and Heliopolis."
2,Decent Album.... But not what I would expect from Samael.,"Has a few good songs here and there but it also has a lot of bad ones in my opinion. The sound is not as heavy as before, and this album emphasizes much more on the techno genre rather than metal which at some arrangements does sound a bit awkward and put together rather sloppy."
1,These Guys Release 'Ceremony of Opposites'?,"Being a huge fan of their earlier, black metal focused efforts, I was absolutely disgusted with 'Reign of Light'. Non redeemable techno pop with sparse metallic moments."
2,The New Samael,"This cd is not very good... I don't know what Samael was thinking when they made this, but it has way to much techno crap in it for me. They sound less like metal, and more like Hardcore music with techno crap. I only like one song (Heliopolis). If you like everything Samael has done previous to this, then you most likely will not like this one."
4,Good movie for kids,I have the video of Space Camp and wanted to upgrade to DVD. My granddaughter loves science and I thought she would enjoy this movie. It was a fun movie to watch and see some of the procedures and drills that kids go through at Space Camp.
3,Space Camp,"Christmas gift. not yet opened, but the dvd is loose and is banging around inside the box. I hope it has not been damaged. Won't find out till Dec. 25."
4,Kate Capshaw's performance is striking.,"I haven't seen this movie, Space Camp since I was a kid and yes it is a little corny, unpredictable, and silly but it is still enjoyable and heartfelt thrill ride. Look for a young Joaquin Phoenix aka Leaf. Capshaw is terrific as Andie who and her husband are assigned to space camp during the summer. Pretty much a guilty pleasure sort of film. Enjoy!"
4,Ultimate 80's go to Space,"This movie is one of the cheesiest movies i have ever seen, perhaps that is why i love it so much. This is a great movie for anyone who has ever dreamed beyond the stars and knows that the impossible can happen."
4,Great Story,I'm about in the middle of it but still I think that it was a great story. Even though it is an 80's movie and I am not a big fan of an 80's movie I still think that it is cool.
4,Not your typical PG rated movie!,"I am a 5th grade teacher and we did an astronaut study and a unit on space, so I thought this would be a great movie to show to my students as a wrap-up. The only downfall to it was that it contained several inappropriate (for a public school) words. I thought I was safe with the PG rating, but obviously PG meant something different in the 80's than it does now. A great movie, but just beware that it has several curse words throughout the entire movie."
3,Space Camp,"I enjoyed taking this trip down memory lane ans sharing it with my children, who are fascinated by space."
4,why is space camp $39,"Ok, So it was a good movie in the 80's....You can get other classics like Stripes, Caddyshack and Ghostbusters for under $20....why can't they release Space Camp at the same price???Just a note for the movie industry to review...."
2,Another good movie littered with terrible words,"This was one of those movies I remember as a child, unfortunately I must remember the good adventure and not the filthy mouths of the actors. I watched it again recently, and was in shock with the amount of profanity used in the movie. This is a kids movie, right? I just don't understand how using ""s***"", ""a**"", and ""d***"" adds anything to the movie. There were at least 10-15 uses of these words during the movie, and I cringed to the point of turning it off.I can't recommend this movie at all! If you, like me, care what comes out of your child's mouth, stay far far away from this movie. If you care about what comes out of your own mouth, then you don't need the reminders in this movie!"
2,just one warning,"Just One Warning: If you plan to go -- or to send one of your children -- to the actual Space Camp, DO NOT see this movie. Otherwise, have fun . . ."
3,Good Kids Movie,"The thing that always trikes me the most about this movie is the number of relatively big movie stars they managed to get into this film.I mean it's a silly little adventure with a ridiculous plot. Send a bunch of teenagers into space and watch what happens. Well I mean sure, I guess it entertains kids. But it's not anything amazing, really."
1,DVD Does Not Work,"Great Movie, I've been looking for it for ages, and I was thirlled to find it on DVD. However, the version done by Anchor Bay Entertainment does not work on either DVD players I own. When I brought it back, I was told that the DVD does not work on many peoples' DVD players, so beware, Anchor Bay Entertainment's version on Space Camp might not work! (I own other Anchor Bay Entertainment DVDs and they work fine, so don't worry about buying other DVDs from them!)"
1,the 1 star is a massive understatement of how bad it is,I don'think you can get worse than this. The special effects are ludicrous and the acting embarrisingly bad. It's a disgrace. Stay away from it.
5,Awesome Seller,Loved the product. It was in better condition than stated. I would definitely use this seller again and recommend them to others.
4,PLEASE READ MY REVIEW!,I have seen this movie only once a long time after it came out. I saw that it had OK acting. What do you expect from an 80's movie? Anyway I am just about to go to Huntsville for my school and the movie was a great way to look forward to my trip! LOL The movie shows how accidents can be solved using problem solving and it shows the interest many have in space. I rate this movie with 4 stars because it shows not only problem solving but the persistence young people have to go into space or follow their dreams.
5,My all-time favorite movie,"This outstanding movie from the late 80's has a great cast, great music, great plot, and even a great robot! The unfolding crush of Kevin and Kathryn shows us what young love is all about. Even Tish, the valley girl with a photographic memory, steals some scenes. Definitely a must see, and a must have movie in any collection!!"
5,Awesome!!!,I'm in 5th grade and we had a Space Camp day and we watched this movie. I love Space Camp. It is a great family movie. After watching Space Camp I want to be an astronaut!!! I couldn't what to see what was next. This is a great movie to have in your house!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,"""Rockin'"" Incredibles","The last ISB album, and while it has its moments of genius they are much more thinly scattered than on earlier records and the whole thing is a little cumbersome....from a band who wove such filigree masterpieces as ""Hangman's"" and ""Wee Tam"" this was really quite sad. Most of the music here actully worked a whole lot better in a live setting: the epic ""Ithkos"" was a total blast on their final tour. Perhaps though, considering the prog-rock excesses that were going on at the time, it was just as well ISB decided to throw in the towel after this album. Still worth getting to complete the collection and for ""Dreams of no Return"" (a major return to form from Robin), but a long way from their best. Nice cover art."
2,"Lasted 1.5 years, and now won't connect, and WON'T TURN OFF! It really isn't worth the $299 I paid for it.","Lasted 1.5 years, but now won't connect, and WON'T TURN OFF! It really isn't worth the $299 I paid for it. I need to find a replacement that will last, because my wife really appreciates hearing the music from abroad."
2,WARNING TO BUYERS,The item does work out of the box as long as you do not try to upgrade the software. I tried and it crashed the entire system. It stops working and can not be fixed except to be sent back for a new one. Make sure to not disconnect the power or turn it off until it is done. How long does it take. I do not know. A call to the company in England was not helpful. They did not answer my e-mails so I called. They said that they were aware of the problem and suggested I return it to the seller for replacement. When I suggested that they send out a recall notice as the product has a major defect the last word from tech support was f**k you! The sound quality is not great for music. Acceptable for voice. I have a strong wi fi and quite a few stations did not come in well. Others that I normally get without a problem on my laptop were buffering in and out. Great idea but....... Very disabppointed.
1,Bland,"After falling asleep three times while reading this book I decided it was not for me. The worst part is that I could not seam to remember much about it at all, it left that little of an impression on you. The story is just not inventive."
2,Great shirt but.....,Great shirt but I gave it two stars for the fact that the shirt was manufactured in El Salvador. Considering the shirts importance I'd be happy to spend a couple of bucks more for one made in the USA. At least it wasn't made in China.
1,Caveat Emptor,"A mere 4 months after I bought it, and with just one use per day, this machine it has started to leak from the Sight Glass (water level monitor).Which undoubtedly signals it is not long for this world.Aside from that, the metal boiler has started to rotate over the cheap plastic base when I screw in the filter handle.This, I suppose, is why one never hears a laudatory ""Italian engineering.""What a waste of time and money!"
1,"Great Album, Bad Pressing","Beware of anything on the Edsel label. I recently purchased this album, and ""Earth Music,"" and the audio quality is poor, at best. This is truly a perfect example of a lousy analog to digital transfer. Hopefully RCA will someday reissue both these albums themselves."
5,I loved it!,The book was in great shape. The story was exciting and I can't read them fast enough. I am always wondering what is going to happen next!
3,Publisher's Weekly gave it a so-so review,"A more complete quote from P.W. would be ""A few of the stories, however, such as Joan Hess's lackluster 'The Maggody Files: Death in Bloom,' slip below par and many of the tales rely more on trick endings than on smart suspense."""
2,Broke a rule and threw it away,"I NEVER throw away books. This one, however, didn't make it to the bin soon enough. If I had wanted to read creationist mythology, that would have been one thing. However, I unsuspectingly bought the book thinking it was general horror/sf. Halfway into it, I tossed it, hoping the rubish collectors would arrive soon. The $5.99 i spent on it at the drug store (no lie) would have been more wisely used as... well, anything."
3,"Good read, as long as you have an ""open"" mind...","First off, great read, just as long as you shut your brain off for chunks of time.pages 1-150 - excellent hunt and thrill fest for all who enjoy reading151-250 - hmmmmm, mediocre silliness based little in science and even less in christianity. Sasquatches? give me a break. First dragons (the Oath) and now this???251-end - excellent suspense and thrills, even though the ending is fairly predictable.Page turning good time, but do your homework before you begin to believe any of the evolutional concepts or misconceptions as the case may be."
1,didn't expect this,"I did not expect to read such a disappointing book, to say the least; since I have thoroughly enjoyed all the other books I've read by Frank Peretti. I got through about 150 pgs and could not believe that not even 24 hours had passed in the story line. Peretti is a very descriptive writer, which I normally like, but this time around he dragged out the events of the story waaaaaaaaaay to much. I was hoping this book would scare me but it is very predictable, and the whole King Kong/Bigfoot plot was a cop out. Maybe I am desensitized but this book did nothing for me. I will admit I could not finish reading it. Although I did skip to end to find out how it ended and besides it being a stupid ending, nothing was really that different from the 200 pages I skipped. I started longing for the end not far into the book. This is a surprise disappointment and I don't suggest you get this book unless you like King Kong/Bigfoot type stories that are about 200 pages too long."
2,"Well, what can be said?","I will be the first to admit that I have never read a Peretti book before Monster. I am not sure that I will read another one after this.As a Christian fiction book, it is good. As a straight up fiction book, it is annoying. The first thing would be the speech of the charecters. The stutter of one of the main charecters nearly caused me to p-p-pull my hair out. Being a Bigfoot mythology fan though, I would not be detered by it. Secondly, I do know it is a Christian fiction book, but man, every time somebody's shoelace came untied they were asking God why? This, I could not get past.I guess I would say that overall, the story was interesting. The charecters were about the most annoying I have been exposed to in a very long time though."
2,Not Peretti's best,"First off, I am a big Peretti fan, unfortunately Monster was not his best effort. At times we had an occasional glimpse of the great Peretti writing we love but for the most part the story line was just barely ok. I would have quit the book had it been anybody but Peretti, I kept thinking it's got to get better. This is the first time in a Peretti novel that I was able to guess the outcome about half way through the book and get it right!"
4,Monster was fairly good classic Peretti book,"Basically, a woman, Beck, goes backpacking with her husband, Reed, and gets kidnapped by a family of animals wich are a cross between human and apes. The rest of the book is about unravelling where the ape/humans came from, who created them, how to catch/kill them, and weather Beck is still alive. A good book, plenty of action to keep your interest, and a pretty easy read."
5,Brilliant,"I really enjoyed this book written in usual Perretti style, once I had started reading it was unable to put it down, actually read it in 3 days!! A good holiday read."
4,Monster by Frank Peretti,"Very exciting book from beginning to end. Frank Peretti one more time creates a masterpiece that when you pick it up to read, it is very difficult to put down. The stars of the story are involved in each chapter, and the plot draws you into the next chapter. You will be anticipating what is going to happen next. A great story indeed"
4,Pretty good,"Monster is a pretty good book, I think. I'm not sure I'd call it a thrill-ride or anything where I'd expect lots of unexpected plot twists or anything, but the overall story is pretty good and it interested me. I'd recommend it. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
2,Not his best.,"If you have never read Peretti, please start with The Oath. That, in my opinion, is his best work. This is his worst, again, in my opinion. I get the impression that, as with many authors who make it big, they went back and published an earlier written work that was not his best because they felt his name would sell it. Do yourself a favor and leave this slow, convoluted story on the shelf and read any of his other books."
3,Almost loved it,"This book is difficult for me to review. I can't give detailed reasons why this book fell short for me without giving away too much of the plot. I have heard many good things about this author and I wish I had started with another of his books first. I guess I can say that two monster story lines going at the same time were just too many, and it added to the lack of believability. Having said that, it is not a bad book and I will be looking forward to reading another of Mr. Pereti's books."
3,Good Summer Read,"Not to complicated but not very exciting. This book is a great summer read but not for anyone looking to get ""lost"" in a book. I would get it at the library."
3,What's evolution got to do with it?,"Very good story telling by Frank Peretti. I especially liked the idea of providing a map of the territory, where the story takes place, at the beginning of every chapter. There are a couple of clever twists in the plot that will give the ""Ah!"" feeling to the reader.However, the plot itself is far-fetched. Evolution is an established school of thought and the extent to which the ""evil"" scientists go to prove this theory one more time, just in case, doesn't sound very credible.There are holes in the evolution model. That's accepted even by the scientists. But thus far, it's still the best scientific model that explains life as we know it is. As far as I am concerned, this book hasn't changed my opinion on that count."
3,"A decent read, but nothing special","Frank Peretti knows how to grab a reader and not let go, and his latest novel is a good example of why he's one of the best writers in Christian fiction today. Even though this is probably his weakest entry to date, it STILL kept me turning the pages.So why only three stars? Peretti deals with the creation vs. evolution theme, the story's only significant Christian content, in generalities rather than presenting a detailed and compelling examination of the scientific evidence (mutations, fossils, etc). Of course, if presented clumsily it could bog the story down and/or come off as ""preachy"". I'll bet Michael Crichton, were he a creationist, could've made it work.Overall, this is a quick read that goes down easy, but won't leave much of an impression. I'd give it four stars if it was written by someone else, but I expect better from Peretti. This was a light snack, not the banquet I was hoping for."
2,Not his best,"I have read several of Frank's books and was waiting with great anticipation when I heard that Monster was being released. Peretti has an incredible way of making you feel as if you are a part of the story. He has a unique ability to give a lot of emotion to words on paper, hence my enthusiasm for his newest release. I wasn't impressed, though. Way too many characters that were underdeveloped for my taste. They seemed like more of a distraction. And in all honesty, I found the story to be very lacking and lame to have a ""Christian"" label attached to it. It starts out with good intentions, but it doesn't sustain its promise as you get deeper into the book."
5,What is the monster?,"The whole crazy adventure starts when Reed and Beck Shelton go on a trip to get away from the pressures of life. Reed is hoping that it will give Beck more self-confidence and she is just going along to placate him. Neither expects to spend a terrifying night in the woods, during which Beck is taken captive by a nameless `thing'. Now Reed and others are racing against time to find his wife before it's too late, while trying to discover just what- or who- the 'monster' is.While Monster was an interesting read, I wouldn't say it was up to the same level of intensity as most of Frank Peretti's books. I found there were no mind-blowing revelations or totally unexpected twists. However, even if it's not his best novel, this was a good book and I still enjoyed reading it."
3,Pretty good - potential spoiler - read at own risk,"I bought this book while on vacation, looking for a good read. I had loved Peretti's stuff in the past. I started reading and almost put it down when I found out what the creatures were. I felt that it was a little cheesy in its premise.But then Peretti sucked me back in with his suspenseful writing style. Overall I liked the book. I would check it out from a library instead of buying it though. (...)"
3,Who is the Monster?,"After waiting 6 years to read another Peretti book, I couldn't help but stay up all night to absorb the whole 400+ pages.When I finished, I had a lot going on in my mind. Was it my favorite book of Peretti's? No. But after reading what he said in the interview regarding one of his favorite authors (Crichton), I understood a little better the book's intent. If you read Crichton's books (especially 'Prey' and 'State of Fear') you understand that Crichton wants us to think about the things that we generally just considered fact. In addition, we should also think about whether the actions we take are the ones that truly show that we are good stewards of God's resources.Don't get me wrong. I truly enjoyed the book, and I couldn't put it down. It was captivating. While I wished some of the characters would have been developed more (Cap and Sing), I did enjoy the story."
5,Peretti does it again!!,"I really enjoyed this book, it is a fast read. There are some suspensful moments and a few scarey ones but I would not put this book in the horror catigory.The only thing that bothered me about this book is the fact that you don't know what or who the monster is for a long time. I guess that was intentional, trying to draw out the suspense.Frank Peretti is a Christian and this is a Christian book. Needless to say any critisism about his main theme evolution, is rediculous. Needless to say, if you want a fun, fast and entertaining read this is the one!"
4,Fast paced Action Thriller,"I enjoyed this book , it grabbed my interest quite quickly . It did not have the spirtuality as far as some of the author's previous works , but the good against evil story was still in place . The person supportiong evolution is the bad guy in the book , which I noticed has drawn criticisms from some professional book reviewers, but they still liked the writing and story . Kind of nice to read books where the crazies are not the religious people for a change . Interesting to see critics in the media get defensive of a person holding to evolution as the bad guy ."
4,Frank sure knows how to build suspense!,"While other have said that this isn't Peretti's best, I tend to agree. This Present Darkness was just a revelation, just because it was so fresh and unexpected.So, quibbles about Monster's plot - and the foray into the evolution issue - aside, let me just say that Peretti has a knack for tweaking the language through descriptions and visual imagery to invoke the maximum level of emotional response. Seldom have woods come across so menacing, and he does a crackerjack job of communicating each noise and odor.Peretti fills his canvas full of characters, and that seems to be more of an asset than a liability. It lends weight and sobriety to a story that could've easily been laughable.A fine job."
2,Not Written Very Well,"Some of the details in the story were just downright confusing. The dialogue was often choppy and didn't flow in a cohesive manner. The character development was pretty weak - we never really did get the full story on Beck's stuttering issues. Also, Beck and Reed's marriage seemed to have much more back story to it - alas, we'll never find out about it.Not a very good read. I only finished it to see if it got better at the end. For really well written Christian fiction, I recommend Stephen Lawhead."
4,Wow!,"Great book as far as scary books go. Not much on the spiritual side of life but a good book anyway. Don't judge a book by its cover because if you do, you will probably not pick this one up. There are some graphic scenes played out but other than that it gives a sound story of deception, corruption and the good guys winning in the end. I wouldn't recommend this book for a younger audience because of the intense descriptions but should be okay for teens and older."
5,Something's out there...,"This is one heck of an amazing book. I'm not going to give away anything, but it's ending is amazing, and powerful.Don't brush it off as your everyday ""Bigfoot legend"", because it's not. Whether you are a fan of Peretti or not, I strongly suggest this book. 'Twas Amazing."
2,Disappointing.,"Having never heard of Frank Peretti, I grabbed this at a Borders in San Diego last week when I was visiting. Being a sucker for a good monster tale, and after reading the inside jacket synopsis, I bought it expecting a ripping good horror yarn. Instead, I found a jumbled tale with multiple hazy characters that were not well developed at all. I found myself having to refer back a few pages every now and then to remind myself who a certain character was, and what they were supposed to be doing. Had I realized this was a work of Christian fiction, I'd have saved my time and money. The anti evolutionary theme didn't become obvious until I was well into it, and I forced myself to muddle through until the feel good ending. I can see this winding up on the Kansas school boards recommended reading list. I've already tossed it in the box going to 1/2 Price Books."
3,Reviewed: Monster by Frank Peretti,"Long awaited book from Frank Peretti. I have enjoyed many of his previous novels and looked forward to the supernatural aspect but was a bit disappointed.A great read, though, in my opinion, not his best work.Reviewed by: Keiki HendrixReviewed for: The Vessel Project"
1,Audio version is dreadful.,"Having the audio book read by Peretti totally ruined it. He changes his voice for each character and listening to him talk like a stuttering, whiny, woman makes you want to rip the cd out of the player. It couldn't get any more annoying.P.S. I read and enjoyed the book itself, just not the audio version."
4,I enjoyed it!,Husband and wife + trip to the woods + abduction of the wife (Lovingly called Beck)+ DNA enhanced creatures + a hunt + suspicion of the husband really being the villian + primate experiments = interesting story.
4,"Not Peretti's Best, but a good read.","I read this book in about a week while on vacation. It was like most Peretti books that had suspense and drama and I had to keep going to see what would happen next. I think both the Darkness books and The Oath are better, but still an Ok read for entertainment. I do like Peretti's take on the Evolution thing that when mutations are added, nothing good comes out of it. And Evolutionists will do anything to try and prove it really happened. Good luck with that!I really enjoyed Peretti's Veritas Project books. Hangmans Curse and Nightmare Acadamy. Try those before the Monster book. They are more fun to read."
3,Awful Narration!!!,"I've just started listening to the audio version of this book. But I have to say - the author should NEVER EVER EVER EVER read another book. His voice is distracting. He sounds bizarre and almost like a cartoon character voice. I have started and stopped this book 3 times now because I honestly can not stand to hear his voice. Thankfully, I have the abridged version, so when I finally do finish it, it won't be too long. But really - with a voice that awful, how could he have thought to read the book?!?!"
3,Disappointing,"I was excited that Peretti had finally come out with another fiction book but was quickly disappointed in this one. It's an ok story line, but I read Peretti's books specifially for the supernatural element and there is none in this book. It's certainly not one I'd read again or recommend. His other previous books like The Visitation, The Oath, This Present Darkness and Piercing the Darkness were much better!! Tilly is also a wonderful little fictional book, but on an entirely other subject, of abortion. I hope Peretti will give another book ""a go"", but in the style he is known for....the supernatural invisible world!"
1,Terrible Book,"I could not have been more disappointed in a book! This book offers no real spritual inspiration. Maybe Frank Peretti has become enchanted by the Bigfoot legend but this book is far and away his worst. The plot is weak, character development is terrible and the ending is anti-climactic. Extremely disappointing!Sometimes good authors feel obliged to publish a book, maybe he was pressured, who knows. This is even close to the same caliber of Piercing the Darkness or This Present Darkness."
2,Disappointed,"Very disappointed in this Peretti book. All his other books were much deeper. This had a good point; don't mess with what God has made, but that was really it. ""This Present Darkness"" and ""Piercing the Darkness"" were much better."
3,Entertaining -- Flaws and All,"Readers have come to expect so much from Peretti, that any small flaw in plot line or character development inevitably is magnified into a major defect. If you are one such critic, then approach ""Monster"" with your tweezers and magnifying glass -- you'll need them to pick nits. Sure, the army of supporting characters was too large and underdeveloped and there was a time or two when Coleridge himself may have been unwilling to suspend his disbelief and, yeah, maybe the Deus Ex Machina moment with the GPS was pushing it a little, but, doggone it, this was an entertaining read that moved as fast as a Sasquatch through a clearing. Frank Peretti's eye for detail delivered in crisp, clean prose overcomes the imperfections. The only criticism I would level at Peretti is that it's been too long between books. Write more, Frank."
2,Monster by Frank Peretti,"I have read almost every one of Peretti's books, beginning with This Present Darkness. I have loved every one of them, and enjoy this author because he weaves a very clever theme of Christianity in each. I was very disappointed in Monster, and felt like I was reading a science fiction novel. I did not find the thread of Christian theme, if it was there. The only time that God was mentioned was occasionally the characters would pray. Very disappointing , and not of the high quality that Peretti's books are."
3,Worth Reading,"There were a few slow chapters and it was predictable at times, but I found it hard to put down. Peretti weaved a pretty solid tale together that I could picture perfectly in my mind's eye. I would recommend it to others.Friday HouseXiiiLost Hours"
3,Bigfoot Abduction..,"I thought the story started of really well. We got to meet and understand the characters and know how their relationship worked. Plus the chase scene and inital abduction was really scary. But shortly after we find out Beck was abducted by a Bigfoot. The rest of the story is about how her husband Reed is trying to track her down with the help of some local people. It was an ok story, some parts were pretty boring and I had to push through them but overall pretty good."
5,This book should be had by all homebirth advocates.,I found this book to be very helpful in viewing birth as a natural occurence. The photographs are amazing but the content by far surpasses them.
1,Original much better!,"original much , really much, really,... very much better!And to; What, no headphones, if you're still listening. I always took it for granted, 801 was the spin ratio of a wheel. 8 to 1, as in ""true wheel"" from, Eno's 1974 ""Taking Tiger Mountain"". Although I could be wrong."
2,plastic,Oh happy happy commershal music for dee white man. Or have I just been listening to too much Linton Kwesi Johnson Black Urhuru Lee Perry Big Youth Burning Spear and Alpha Blondy.Also as bongo playing goes the real stuff is more intense and hypnotic than this per seOh well it's an introduction I suppose.
4,classic,This truly is a classic reggae record. The songs really stand out from much of the records from the same era. Many great ones on here. Definately worth checking out. Although the package from the out of print Blood and fire version is much better. It has a second cd and a booklet with pictures and info about the recording. If you can't get a hold of the blood and fire version this one is still worth getting.
5,the ultimate,"There are not enough good things to say about this profoundly serious, HEAVY HEAVY record. The production is perfect - the vocals are otherworldly, the arrangements are brilliant - Perry's masterpiece. The Congos walked it like they talked it - they were serious committed rastas - Cedric even made Perry locks up - and this record is the testament of serious religious commitment. The album highlight is certainly Ark of the Covenant, but there are not even any average tracks. Absolutely stratospheric. The best twenty bucks I have ever spent, the highlight of my record collection.DO NOT, however, ""save money"" on some crap recording made from a tape or old vinyl - buy THIS VERSION - this blood and fire reissue. As always, Blood and Fire did a phenomenal remastering job - I wish they could get the rights to Culture's back catalog."
5,the true essence,"this is the real deal. I would not lead you astray--- if you dig reggae, this is roots... full of delightfully nasty, tasty & meaty hooks. Not as sophisticated of song-writing as Bob Marley wound up putting out (not pop-friendly radio here), but definitely deep grooves with true rastaman vibration. Just a great energy on this recording--- goin' rasta style, on a hillside with a Red Stripe and...May I also add that the packaging is as quality as I've found... totally worth the ""green"" to get the 2cd remastered set."
5,Not just the greatest reggae album ever...,"...this might be the best album ever. Really. This is so good that even after hundreds of listens, it is still fresh and new. Timeless and amazing."
5,Mystical reggae,"Each arrangement is enchanting. I've listened to this album when it was first released. Bought the CD recently and am still discovering it's charm, radical arrangement for its time. A must buy release. Peace."
5,In-FREAKING-credible!!!!! A must have for ANYONE!,"Dear Amazon reader: I'm sure you've seen many albums that receive 5 star averages, but when you look at the individual reviews, there are always those people who give an album 1 or 2 stars for whatever ""reasons"" (haters abound). Notice, though, that as of this posting, this album has gotten 5 stars from EVERYONE, minus a few 4 star ratings scattered about. That should say it all - 'Heart of the Congos' is divine...like Desmond Dekker said - ""beautiful and dangerous""."
5,Essential Roots,"While I don't know if this album ""makes a collection"" or what not, it is certainly one of my faves to session with and is also super-strong, musically speaking. Excellent production (by the Congos)and of course the Lee Perry/The Scientist synthesis on mixing are simply sublime. It is a shame the Congos specifically and reggae in general is relegated to such a subsecondary position of interest in the musical world. This music and the amenities that go with it are truly the healing of the nations.Get this one!!"
5,The most Transcendent Reggae record ever made; Just Amazing,"If you collected the best cuts from all of Bob Marley's records, this one would still top it. Why? First of all, the production by Lee 'Scratch' Perry, is sheer genius even though it was recorded on a Teac 4-track machine as late as 1976! You feel like you're getting pulled into a cave by the mixture of spacy ambience and monstrously deep bass and drums. Second, the vocals by Cedric Myton and Roydel Johnson are beyond genius, they're magical, like a combination of Smokey Robinson and Marvin Gaye floating in outer space. Third, there's a defenite all encompassing good humor or 'postive vibration' underlying things even when the lyrics are quite serious. It doesn't try to drive its point home with a hammer but rather convinces all the more effectively with the unrelenting beauty of the music. I repeat, you cannot do better than this record if you like Reggae and Soul music."
4,Truly Artistic,"This Congos release doesn't sound like any other reggae release. It took me a while to appreciate it. If you like harmonies and roots rhythms, this is for you. If you are more into dub, the second disk almost reaches the highs of the Super ape recordings.I LOVE Mr.Perry; I LIKE the Congos."
3,mystified,"I'm more than a little mystified at all the glowing reviews and ""best album ever"" hype about this CD. It's not bad, I enjoy listening to it, and yet it doesn't really grab me or send me into convulsions of bliss or ecstasy. Songs? Uh, these guys jam and groove more than write memorable songs. I keep listening and I just don't get the ""wow"" factor. I love Trojan label reggae, Marley, Steel Pulse, Black Uhuru, and even Lee Perry. Maybe I need to smoke a few spliffs to ""get it"", but for now this is nothing more than ""okay"" in my book."
5,Best boot yet.,I have had many pair of boots in my life and these are my new favorites. I just got back from Pheasant hunting with them and the 200gr. of thinsulate was perfect. My feet were completely warm and dry the whole trip. I did not even want to take them off at the end of a hard day. There was absolutely no break in and were comfortable right from the start. I like the height too for encounters with swamps and sloughs. Do your feet a favor and buy them.
2,Incomplete Race A Disappointment,"The company that issued this DVD has done an admirable job of making some classic NASCAR races available in their entirety, and any student of NASCAR's history should seek out these DVD's. But there is one major problem with this DVD of the 1976 Daytona 500. A significant portion of the race has been lost and therefore is not included here. It clearly states at the beginning of the disc that much of the middle of the race is missing. Unfortunately, though, there is no indication on the outer package, or on this webpage, that the race is incomplete. The famous finish is included, and I won't spoil the ending for anyone unfamiliar with this historic race."
1,Absolute junk,"On power-up this unit is stuck in one screen. Pressing the buttons per instruction sheet suppose to get me to setup screen for time etc. - doesn't work. When connected to phone line and call is ringing, nothing changes on the display even though my other phone that has caller id displays the caler id correctly. Not worth the price of shipping to return the unit....."
5,GOOD BUT BETTER,"THIS IS TRUE TUT AND POSSIBLY THE BEST SOLO EXAMPLE OF HIS STYLE. OF COURSE, IF YOU THINK THIS IS HIGH PRAISE, WAIT FOR THE CD (RE) RELEASE OF HIS WORK WITH BUTCH ROBBINS, NORMAN BLAKE, DAVE HOLLAND AND VASSAR CLEMMENS. OVER TO YOU AMAZON!"
4,dobro/steel stuff,tHIS IS ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS I'VE HEARD IN A LONG TIME. oN A PAR WITH MIKE AULDRIDGE. i STILL THINK BOB BROZMAN IS THE BEST EXPONENT OF STEEL BUT FOR BLUEGRASS YOU CAN NOT BEAT THIS. THE ADDITIONAL WORK BY NORMAN BLAKE IS FANTASTIC. BUY IT! BUT OH DEAR AMAZON WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF HIS STUFF!
3,Good time pass movie,Some really funny parts. Some moderately funny and then some are just absurd. Koppikar and Kapoor are hilarious at times. Deshmukh is tolerable. As always with movies like these. Turn your brain on hibernate mode and enjoy.
4,great adult comedy,"Isha Koppikar is definitely the star of this entertaining, although somewhat of an inconsistent sex comedy.She is THE character from the very first scene. Dominated every scene she was a part of. Absolutely loved that Bihari accent in which she spoke. Overall, an extremely likable performance to say the least.Ritesh Deshmukh is a natural at comedy.The sex jokes were hilarious at times, but quite the opposite when they became overly vulgar. I hope nobody makes the mistake of watching this movie with their parents. Stick to ur friends or watch it alone.Overall, definitely worth a watch for the comedy and of course, Isha Koppikar."
2,Not one of the best,"I have not just read, but bought, every volume in the Railroad Color History series since its inception, and this is the first one I have been dissatisfied with. It is simply not a history of the Chessie system: it describes the formation of the system, but that's all: the rest of the book is just a topographical description of the routes which largely covers ground already dealt with in previous books in the series.Production values are also not up to scratch. In particular, there's a large map that purports to show the components of the system but is actually nothing of the sort. One wonders how a bloomer like this got through the production process. There are also more literals than usual, especially in captions. The saving grace, as aways in this series, is the quality of the photos, but that's not enough to compensate for the other deficiencies."
2,Seen better days....,"As each issue arrives it seems to have fewer and fewer substantive articles about the repair and fun of owning a vintage collectible car. Over the past few years, it continues to be filled more with the hype about the auction market and car prices than about the cars themselves. Couldn't stand reading one more ""better buy it before it goes up"" or ""well bought"" comment. Finally let my subscription lapse....time to find a new resource more dedicated to ""cars"" rather than ""money about cars""."
2,There are much better buys out there!,"Not Good. The VCR has good picture quality and some good features, but has serious drawbacks. Like the previous reviewer pointed out, the display on the VCR itself is useless, it doesn't even display the channel that the machine is on (you are forced to use the TV screen) which makes watching one program/recording another frustrating. The motor/tape transport is extremely noisy, even during normal playback. The included remote, while good, is frustrating to use, as the ""volume"" feature works only when 'TV' is selected. This forces you to constantly select between TV and VCR when watching a tape. Also, the machine is SO light that it slides all over the cabinet, we were forced to put rubber feet on the coasters. Consider other options before buying this one."
1,"nothing new hear, not worth the effort","Hank just rehashes old stuff. Some of it's good, but he also resorts to some substandard items and tactics. Kind of embarrassing at times, plus he uses material from young-earth radical Henry Morris, well known for his deceptions. For good, intellectial studies of the topic, see the books by Behe, Denton, Phillip Johnson and Hugh Ross."
1,A simple book for simple folk.,"Hank has written an easy to understand book for those who have trouble understanding one of the most easily understood subjects in science. He shows very clearly that he lacks even the most basic understanding of evolutionary theory. He tears down ""a"" theory of evolution, but one that bears almost no resemblance to evolutionary science as it is known and practiced by real scientists. This is a book for those who need to believe that they are the focus of the universe; It helps them to ignore their hairy knuckles, appendix, tail bones, canine teeth and bad backs. Every argument he presents can be downloaded for free from fundamentalist web sites. Lucky thing for me it was a gift."
1,Simply misleading,"I read Mr. Hanegraaff's book on the urging of my Creationist brother, and after fully analyzing it, researching the science, and tracking down the qoutes used, I decided there is only one thing you need to know about this book: it is designed to intentionally mislead people who do not know very much about science.Anyone with a layman's knowledge of evolution will see through this book immediately, but those who are less well informed can be easily swayed by the misqoutes, bad science, distortions, and outright fabrications contained within. I must hand it to Mr. Hanegraaff, however, as he is a propagandist of the first rate."
1,A poorly research compendium of Creationist dogma.,"Hank Hanegraaff continues in the Creationist's tradition of misquoting, quoting out of context, or simply distorting the truth to make it fit his belief structure. In ""The Face..."" Hank implies that Einstein and Leonardo da Vince supported the Creationist's viewpoint. Rather implausable as Einstein's God certainly did not resemble Hank's. And da Vinci's writings indicated that he did not believe in a universal flood. In fact, Leonardo da Vinci is described by some as one of the first evolutionists.Hank's review of the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics is very unique in that his 2nd Law has little resemblance to that employed in Physics.In short, the book is excellent fiction!!"
1,As a Christian I am embarassed,"This book is an arguament to discredit evolutionists that aren't Christians. It does have some valid points though. He takes the credit away from these points by stateing something crazy. It isn't even focused on the Bible anymore. It is focused on making accusations with no basis. Bieng a Christian evolutionist I wanted to read something with some integrity...I obviously read the wrong book. of course, if you are new to the subject this book can easily convince you that evolution is wrong."
1,Bloated Dogma,"I got it for free, and that is good because it is a terrible book. I wanted to give it ZERO STARS. Laughably bad, Hanegraaff uses personal attacks on Darwin to discredit evolution theory. All the quotes are out of context. Even the caption under Isaac Asimov's picture was funny. ""Evolutionist Dr. Isaac Asimov..."" really? is that what Asimov is known for? The whole thing is twisted and stupid and I'm embarrassed for Hanegraaff. The logic is totally flawed. Hangraaff credits Darwin with the Nazi Holocost. Wow what a leap! Kind of scary though, since a lot of people believe what ever they see in print. This book is really full of hot air, I have to put a paperweight on it to keep it on my desk. It doesn't even discuss present day evolution theory at all. Don't waste your time."
4,A real eye opener to Scientific Fraud for evolution,"This book is interesting in that it shows the scientific fraud, fakery, and outright lies that have permeated the world in the name of valid science. Hank Hanegraaf shows, with hard science, the complete Fraud that is evolution. He shows how it would be, for all intensive purposes, statistically impossible for even one amino acid or protein molecule to even form on it's own, by chance. Also in the book are the many examples of archaelogical fraud used to ""advance"" the case of evolution, but in reality just show us that from a purely archaelogical viewpoint, evolution has no basis for fact. This book is an eye opener, and in the words of Hank Hanegraaf himself, ""If you begin as a creationist, you will become equipped to demonstrate the farce of evolution. In addition, your confidence in the Christian worldview will be solidified. If you begin as an evolutionist, the shaky pillars of your worldview will be underminded."""
1,Truly Awful,"How do wingnuts with simple 8th grade science and logic get to write books? Faith based logic is no logic at all, and that's why this book is only nonsense."
1,Is this against Darwinism?,"Hank seems to misrepresent almost every detail of modern evolution theory. He seems to argue against lamarckian ideas and saltationism. He confuses spontaneous generation with abiogenesis. He attacks fossil finds that have been dismissed by scientists for decades. I wonder if Hank actually read up on his material. He seems to quote mine (searching for quotes that can mean different things in the wrong context). If he is a fair representative of the modern creationist movement, I have no choice but to list it as another cult with crazy fringe ideas. He left the science at home and pumped up the rhetoric. I'm sorry that we Christians have these kind of people speaking for us. I think Hank will have a lot of explaining to do to the Big Guy. Shame on you Hank. You are taking advantage of our current situation of poor science standards and filling minds with falsehoods in exchange. It will catch up to you."
1,Falls Short of Author's Potential,"I have read two other works by Hank Hanegraaff, 'Christainity in Crisis' and 'Counterfeit Revival', both were excellent. However, this book does not live up to the author's potential. In the books mentioned previously he was carefull to throughly document his statements, but he does not do so in this book. Instead, he jumps onto the very popular bandwagon of Creationism without knowing anything of science. This one fact causes the book to be ladden with assumptions that are never throughly researched or documented, which leaves much of the book giving opinion, but no strong evidence for the case of creation. Unfortunately, I was disappointed that in writing this book he choose to leave his objective mind at home."
4,This book clearly exposes the fairy tale called evolution,"Mr. Hanegraaff does an excellent job, showing the fallicies of the argument for evolution. He presents clear & concise scientific data to refute the theory of evolution. Kudos to him for this great work,"
4,Full of Common Sense Reasons to Dought Evolution,Hanks book follows his normal logic. He presents in an ordered sequence and gives both the believer and the sceptic sound common sense reasons why evolution not only did not occur but cannot occur. I recommend this to anyone who believes that God chose evolution as the means of creation.
1,Silly,"It is hard to understand why some want to see evolution as such a big issue. Christians would be better of letting it go and fight other battles. This book illustrates how pointless it is. If you reject evolution you have to reject 1. The theory of continental drift 2. The big bang theory 3. Carbon dating 4. Most contempory Geology 5. Most modern theories relating to the universeThe only people who fight evolution are those who have no knowledge of the implication of what they are doing. That is rejecting most of what is our modern understanding of the world.Religion can exist with evolution but when it rejects it, it puts itself in luny land."
1,Empty Propoganda,As a christian I was upset at this rather overdogmatic approach to a complex topic. Books such as this come across as simple ideology.
1,Hank should stick to circular logic biblical interpretation,"As many other posters have remarked, this book is a sad example of a dogmatic Christian trying desperately to discredit observable scientific facts.His fallacies and intellectual dishonesties are too numerous to list, but I'd like to simply and clearly refute one of them:Hank incorrectly states that there are no transitional fossils. Just to give two examples, there are Probelesodon and Massetognathus, with both reptilian features (lower jaw comprises several bones, jaw joint formed between articular and quadrate bones) and mammalian features (teeth specialized for different functions, lower jaw with prominent coronoid process, double condyle at back of skull for neck articulation)Another tough one to argue away is the incredibly detailed, 50 million year record of evolution of the family of the Equidae (Horse)..."
3,pleasant but not memorable,"An artificial ""reunion,"" the album was masterminded by a record company huckster desperate to reverse the omens of Quicksilver's fading popularity and musical quality. Nevertheless, there are enough good tunes -- ""Gypsy Lights,"" ""Bittersweet Love,"" ""I Heard You Singing,"" ""Flames"" -- to wash out the bad taste left by QMS's dismal previous recording. It's great to have Cipollina back in the mix too, but, ironically, it's Duncan who has most of the best solos."
4,Almost perfect,"I use this amp for playing out, and I play out a lot. It's a well built cabinet that's held up to wear. The amp itself is versatile and VERY LOUD. Don't be convinced that you must have a 4/12 head/cabinet to play out, this thing delivers and is much easier to tote around.I love the sound, the look, the reliability... but I do have a couple problems. The major problem I have is the input jacks, which are plastic. These are cheap and will become stripped after a while. I suggest replacing those. Second, I wish this amp came with tilt-back legs... ah well.I prefer the version with the four ten-inch speakers. You'd expect that would make it heavier... but it somehow wieghs about four pounds less. Go figure. This amp is almost perfect."
1,Are You Serious?,I read a review that said this makes chills go up and down her spine and really affects her because she has been though a lot of s**t well i think it is total bull and retarded. 50 cents lyrics are some of the worst in the rap industry i mean nelly writes better lyrics in his songs so if you are telling me that 50 is one of the deepest rappers then you have got to be on crack. I am a huge 50 cent hater and i will always be cause he is a fake thug and runs and snitches on his homies to the police cause they would not ride with him.
3,Not fantastic - just good.,"This album is definately a fun one to listen to, from a talented rapper. Though I wouldn't recommend it totally (if you want a new brilliant CD buy Madonna's Confessions on a dance floor album), it's a really fun CD, though I'd reccomend listening to it on iTunes or something first."
1,The beginning of the end for this no-talent rogue,"Movie flops at the box officeSoundtrack missed Number OneClothing line isn't sellingI'm glad this loser got knocked off his high horse. If he didn't get shot 9 times, he would have been flipping burgers at Arby's."
4,Watch the Movie,"This movie is well worth watching. 50 cent is a splendid, realistic, and convincing actor. He is entertaining, man, the whole movie is engaging; there are captivating characters, car chases, shootouts, emotional scenes, man everything in one. It's funny too b/c of Terrence Howard. Man this movie blew me away, I enver expected 50 to act so well or put together anything great being his first flick, but man this movie far exceeds the entertainment value in 8 mile or any other rap flick, period. Go see it."
1,Ja Rule has returned!!!!,50 dissed Ja and ruined his career because that fool sang on all his tracks...now 50 sings on all his tracks. People in the hood hate his music and he's a pop artist now...no cred whatsoever. MOP and Mobb is the only thing pimpin' about this album. G-Unot is done.Listen to Game's Ghost Unit mixtape and you'll know what I'm talking about.
1,"OMG, Another 50 Cent/G Unit CD! YES!","Oh yes, OMG! I love 50 Cent! I love G Unit! I think their music is great! I am totally going to buy this soundtrack and their next CDs when they come out! Jesus Christ, I sooooo can't wait to listen to them! I am going to spend my hard-earned money on these masterpieces!IF YOU TOOK ANY OF THAT SERIOUSLY, THIS CD IS FOR YOU!!"
2,not worth ownin-2 1/2 starz,"not worth 20 buckz.pretty much the only good songs are :when death becomes youhave a partydon't need no helpwindow shopperi don't know officerwhen it rains , it pours(reeeeaally nice R&B;)honestly,im dissapointed.im a REALLY BIG g-unit/50/em/dre fan,(oh yeah,this CD also suckz cause em and dre didnt make appearancez!!)and i thought this CD would be better,sigh."
3,nice soundtrack but bit boring,not as fresh as orginal g unit album...nice beats and lyricesonly for FANS
3,G-Unit Goes Hollywood...,"Here I am once more, reviewing another one of G-Unit's records, and yet again, I am hoping for the best while expecting the worst. Well, after the less than spectacular releases that G-Unit has been dishing out, lets just say I'd be interested to see if they can redeem themselves on this collaboration. So 50, I'm willing to give you a second chance to prove me wrong...For those of you who went out to see 8 Mile, you were probably surprised at what the director was able to pull off. I'm no movie critic (As of yet!) but 50 Cent's new film ""Get Rich or Die Tryin'"" has some decent sized shoes to fill. However, in terms of soundtracks I thought 8 Mile's was overhyped, mainly due to 50 Cent's exploding popularity, and Rakim's first (and only) track with Interscope... does G-Unit have the talent to outdo Em's OST?"
1,50 RULES,50 cent bends over for any rapper because he can take it like a man. Whoops i mean he is tough and nobody can mess with him cause he takes steriods and that is why he is big and ugly. The voice sounds awesome and the lyrics are superb to any other rapper in the game right now so watch out world 50 is coming to a town near. And that means a lot of guys will be there rooting for 50 and little bit of girls but not much. BUY ANY 50 DOES CAUSE HE IS THE BEST!
3,Could be a lot better,"this soundtrack could've been a lot better. it starts out hot with the opening track being hustler's ambition. however, it doesn't have anymore tracks that stand out. Window shopper is a decent track, and get low by lloyd banks is hot. these tracks are the hottest songs on the soundtrack. It could've been better, but it doesn't really make the mark because the rapping doesn't really reach that mark. i only recommend people buy this album if you are a super 50 cent fan. if not, then don't buy it."
1,"Damn, He Got Rich. That Means He Didn't Die Trying!","I'm open minded about all musical styles, but I must say 50 Cent's rapping is emotionless and his voice is flat. I guess music is all about the packaging nowadays though.Drugs? Check.Women? Check.Bling-Bling? Ho ho ho."
4,At Last A Consistent Soundtrack!,Hate him or love him u can't deny that 50 has put out a quality soundtrack. Most soundtracks have one or two hot singles but then when u listen to the whole record its full of rappers u never heard of before rapping tracks that sound like rejects from the latest chingy album. Props should go to fifty for presenting a thouroughly consistent class-a line up with the likes of mobb deep and m.o.p. Fair enough it sounds like evry other g-unit release but in my opinion thats far from an insult in hip-hop these days.
5,Great CD. G-G-G-G-Unit!!!!,"This is probably the best soundtrack that I own, aside from 8 Mile & The Longest Yard. 1 thing that I really like about this album, is that most soundtracks is a whole bunch of different artists, well, this whole album is 50 Cent & everybody from the G-Unit crew. So the whole soundtrack is basically another G-Unit CD. There's 2 songs on the soundtrack that's not listed on the back of the CD case. Those songs are ""Best Friend"" by 50 Cent & ""I'll Whip Ya Head Boy"" by 50Cent featuring Young Buck. Over all, the CD is great. I really enjoy listening to the great music that's on it. If you're a 50 cent fan or a fan of G-Unit, go out & buy this CD. You will not regret it."
1,WINDOW SHOPPER VIDEO MAKES ME SICK!!!,"FIRST OF ALL WHAT'S WRONG FOR BEING NOT RICH? 50 WAS DISSING PEOPLE FOR NOT BEING RICH IN HIS LATEST MUSIC VIDEO? HOW SHALL0W CAN HE GETS??!! SEEMS LIKE HE HAS A PROBLEM TREATING PEOPLE THIS WAY AND SHOW IT IN VIDEO AND SET A BAD EXAMPLE FOR PEOPLE WHO'S WATCHINGBTW, WE ARE THE ONES THAT MADE U RICH AND BOUGHT YOUR CDS!! AND 50 U WERE ONCE BROKE TOO!! I'LL STOP BUYING UR CDS AND YOUR MUSIC IS NOT CATCH AS THEY USED TO BE!!"
1,Horrible.,"Yet another album in the long forray of ""Gangsta"" rap. It's funny how 50 Cent coined the phrase wanksta, when he's the biggest one in the entire music industry. The only songs worth listening to on this soundtrack are the ones with Mobb Deep, and even they can't do this thing justice.If you want real hip-hop, pick up DJ Muggs Vs. GZA: Grandmasters, which just came out a few weeks ago. Leave this bull**** on the shelves."
1,3rd Worst Album of the Year Behind The Massacre and Yayo,"Awful. Pop music at it's worst. Below average lyrics, flows and beats."
1,50 Cent Sucks,I am a 50 cent hater and proud of it and to all you d**kriders it dont bother me that you hate on The Game because you all are just scared cause you know The Game can take 50 cent out no problem and 50 knows this cause he has not replied to any of the songs that Game made on his two mixtapes and there were a lot of them now i know you are going to say is 50 does not care well it shows me that he is scared cause Game knows a lot of Bloods and Crypts from L.A. to New York where 50 claims to be from but wont go there when Game is there. Anyways do not buy this piece of garbage buy something better even a Ja Rule album would be better then this.
1,This Soundtrack Sucks,This soundtrack sucks and so does the idiot name 5-0.Window shopper is the worst song I Have ever heard and everything else sucks.Why are people buying this junk anyway?
2,Listen to Get Rich or Die Tryin',"First off - this isn't a kid's review. I've been a fan of 50's since he first dropped. I'm from Long Beach, CA , but that has nothing to do with this review. This album is weak. If you want to listen to good 50 - listen to Get Rich. This CD is full of mediocre beats and average rhymes. The hottest song on this CD is When it Rains it Pours. Hustler's Ambition is a close second. Listen to Best Friend - then tell me if 50's still hard. He fell off. G Unit is weak. Mase was a pastor for those who don't know. Save your money."
1,50 Cent the Artist=boring. 50 cent Hustle=cool,"two types of 50 Cent: the Artist is Boring.just bites Ja Rules whole formula mixed in with a Big time Bite off 2pac&Eminem. 50 cent the Industry Hustle=a cool smart Cat.Problem is I gotta sit&listen to the same ole raps,same ole beats&everything in between is so predictable.but 50 is a smart cat for getting as much as he can while His 15 minutes are running. he ain't no dummy.He knows what's up.Musically speaking though He has dropped a lemon on the past two albums.the last thing He did that was banging was ""outta Control"" with Mob Deep.but even the trademark Westside!!!! Grooves can't correct 50's musical shortcoming as a Artist.50 Cent should hook up musically with Madonna&I bet they could continue to Milk the gallon until folks find out how half full the glass truly is."
5,flawless ( in the top 10 of best albums ever),"Fifty did it again. This album is straight fire and will bump in my ride for years...this is a true masterpiece. Fifty is a living legend and nobody can f*** with him.'We both think alike' is in the top 10 of all time greatest songs. Mobb Deep, MOP and Mase are good rappers but thanx to the entire G unit, this soundtrack is a classic. Cop it and stop hating !!!!!"
3,Caution,"Well, it's a lot of good songs, but...""This album contains new stereo recordings performed by the featured artists.""It's just not quite as funky as the originals. Still some good music though. I'm curious as to when this was recorded."
2,Watch Out!,"These are not the songs you know and love! They are the same songs in a technical sense, but they do not sound the same as the songs you grew up with. They sound slightly different, like they were recorded later or something. If I had it to do over again I would not have bought it."
2,"RELAX, I'M A DOCTOR TOO.","The slasher code states that kids who have sex by the lake must die. This movie starts out honoring that code. The killings happen around a annual harvest festival when college kids converge on Devil's Lake. The last one happened 20 years ago, now they are happening again. Same murderer? Copycat? There are a number of suspects: The family of the convicted murderer who claims their son/brother was wrongly accused. A new guy in town, son of a former resident. The old sheriff who believes they are connected. The deputy who is jilted. The creepy town pathologist.After 8 people are killed the sheriff proclaims, """"Although there have been nine murders, we're not ready to say that any of this is connected."" The movie just wasn't that great. The characters and dialouge were bland as were most of the murders.F-bomb, sex, good initial nude scene with topless chase through woods."
4,Great production bad acting,"I am a huge fan of all sort of movies, film done in good taste and bad as well as high budget and low budget all have their place. This was entertaining- the acting for the most part was pretty bad across the board (the 2nd murder was better than passable in that they did what they were supposed to- make out and die partying). the script had holes- not really inspired- but the production value was awesome! you didn't trip over any inconsistencies or how poorly things were executed, as is often the case in cheesy horror movies. it did not offend your sensibilities as a viewer insofar that you didn't get the feeling you were watching cheap porn. good in fact great job for the resources available."
3,"good, could be better","Using this was pretty easy, but whatever you think you need, double it! These tubes do not stretch too far. Order lots!"
4,dizzying and fabulous,"While definitely not one of T. Rex's best-known albums, it was actually my first, and I do love it. You can't sit still while listening to it, and the brilliantly thought-out glam-rock melodies will stick in your head forever. I can't even begin to decide upon a favorite."
3,OK,"This tastes like Kool-Aid to me, which I'm not a fan of. This would be Good for kids but I will not reorder."
4,It's a zinger,"So far, I have thoroughly enjoyed all of the teas in the ""zinger"" series. I like Celestial Seasonings in general. Of course, the tea bags have no strings and that is something of an annoyance, but other than that, the teas are tasty and enjoyable. Zinger really is a great description of the product. It has a surprising and deeply flavorful taste and an aroma to match. The lemon has a fresh, rich lemon flavor. This one is an amazing medley of berry flavors. It might be my second favorite variety after the Red Zinger. It is a great option for those who enjoy herbal teas."
2,BEWARE OF SOY LECITHIN,"IF YOU'RE SOY SENSITIVE LIKE ME BE AWARE THAT THIS AND OTHER HIBISCUS TEAS BY CELESTIAL SEASONINGS HAVE SOY LECITHIN. IT MAY NOT BE LISTED ON THE WEB BUT WHEN YOU GET IT IN THE MAIL AND READ THE INGREDIENTS ON THE BOX THERE IT IS, SOY LECITHIN. SOY LECITHIN DOESN'T MAKE ME ITCH AS MUCH AS SOYBEAN OIL OR SOY PROTEIN BUT IF I WANT TO GET AN ITCH FREE GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP I STAY CLEAR OF IT."
4,Very Nice if you know how to sweeten it!,"This herbal tea is one of my favorites. I used to sweeten it using wild flower honey, very very amazing taste. I do not advise you to try it with sugar."
3,Berry medley!,"Celestial Seasonings recent zinger line is much improved from the former hibiscus/rose hip dominated sour tea. The flavor of this purple red brew was a nice wild berry medley. The mix of natural berry flavor reminded me of kool-aid--in a good way!Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.Quote from the box: ""The road up and the road down is one and the same thing."" Heraclitus."
5,"Celestial Seasonings Herb Tea, Wild Berry","I have only tried the wild berry and found it to be very good. The problem I have been having with the tea purchased in the store is that it is very weak anymore. Barely makes a cup, and not a good one.This makes a very good cup of tea, and I am enjoying it. Thanks Cesestial Seasoning and Amazon."
2,Bad moral lesson,"This is a disappointing follow-up to Wormell's 1999 book, ""Blue Rabbit And Friends,"" which has the same groovy artwork (boldly colored linoleum block prints), same basic structure (Blue Rabbit meets one animal at a time and they all go together to solve a mystery, with a zingy surprise ending...) Where this volume falls flat is the blatant amorality of the ending -- the rabbit's runaway bicycle causes several mishaps, but rather than apologize, wabbit jumps back on his bike and rides off, shining on all the upset critters in his wake. Yeah, maybe the ending is unexpected and unconventional -- it's also a terrible message to give little kids. (Ha, ha. Scr*w you!) I would never read this book to my daughter.Also, the story seems pretty flat and uninspired -- try the first Blue Rabbit book instead... it's much better."
1,A study in poor character,"I agree with the other review who said this is a lovely book with a bad moral lesson. Blue Rabbit knows he has wronged his friends, as he feels guilt and shame. But when it comes time for him to own up to his mistakes and apologize for the trouble he has caused, he flees instead. I really dislike this book, but it was given to us by a favorite relative so we read it to our son as an example of what *not* to do."
1,JVC XV-D723GD player is a dog; avoid,Had one when the DVD-A craze hit in 2000; brand new and defective on some soundtracks. Too new to fix so they replaced it. Got the hint and sold it right away. These are terrible players and should be avoided like the plague!
5,great performance(,"The first thing that i woul like to say about jvc is that you could pay twice or maybe more for this sound this good ,I have compare this dvd audio with other much more expensieve dvdaudios and i can say the the sound is as crisp and acurrate as the other system that i compared to.the front panell is tastefully minimal,with only a power button and flip-up door hiding wchich give a very elegant look.i highly recommend this product"
3,Perfect for any DVD experience,"This is the perfect model for people who wants the most of their DVD player. It has built in Decoder for AC3, DTS and DVD Audio. You dont need any separate decoder it handles anything on its own. And the sound... Dont even get me started on the sound. Its perfect!"
5,buy it. buy it now.,this is one of the nicest car books in my collection. it is packed full of very beautiful full page automobile prints and commentary by alan fearnley. it has prints of vintage cars as well of vintage car races. simply stunning and a real bargain. dont wait....buy it now.
4,worth the $,"Eventually you get the feel for the computer, I'd say there are 3 different personality types, but good for 20-30 hours of enjoyment until then. I didn't feel it was unfair, I got just as many lucky river cards as the puter. My only gripe is sometimes when I get a big card on the river the other players suddenly become less aggressive. Useful for getting a feel for percentages & what starting hands to stick with. Great, simple interface & no annoying voices or music. No substitute for the real thing, but novices will be entertained."
4,Poker 2005 beginners review,I have never really played poker before and this program is very helpful.
2,Skip it if you are more than a beginner,"Had hoped for something that would truly offer random computing but it was obvious fairly quickly that most of the effort was put in to the graphics and not the numbers. Since there are numerous free online poker sites where you can play against real people I doubt anyone is ever going to put in the effort to create a really good hold-em game that takes advantage of modern computing power, this may be as good as it gets.The game is predictable and will teach you bad habits if you are not a beginner. For the beginners this will give you the basic experience you need for a smooth transition to playing against other people but I would not stick with this game for to long. When you start to recognize patterns and regularly beat the computer then it is time to move on. Recommended for beginners only, then give it to another beginner when you feel confident you understand the basics."
2,Hokey at best...,"I really put a lot of faith into the reviews I read about this game before purchasing it. Unfortunately, that was a mistake. The AI is absolutely horrible. I set the options to show the hands the players were playing with at the end and was amazed at what the computer would call a big raise with. Likewise, I was also amazed at what the computer would fold when facing a medium size bet - top pair?I set the difficulty at it's highest level and the computer played worse than the newbies at my weekly game. Obvoiusly the people who wrote such rave reviews are not students of the game with an understanding of the fundamentals.With that said, this is probably a great game for kids or people who just want to get some experience before playing for the first time. However, it is not recommended for anyone at an intermediate skill level or better."
1,Wont install on my Windows Vista,"This will not finish installing on my Vista. Wont let you cancell, locks up , must restart to get out of the install. this is a 2004 disc. Went to website for help. No support for older versions now, they offer a free online version download, but you have to be online to play. Defeats my wanting to play off line. No way to directly contact, or e-mail website to ask questions for help on older versions like this. Seller says for windows vista, but I think it only works on 98 up to XP, not vista"
4,Casino Ready?,"It helped me ""get a handle"" on the game. Thought it was very well laid out and well-written."
3,Fun -- but not a learning tool,"I've had a lot of fun playing this the past couple of weeks. But if you're looking for real practice playing Texas Hold 'Em against skilled (virtual) opponents, this isn't a good choice. My evidence: It took me SIX TRIES to LOSE in heads-up tournament play. And I am NOT a good poker player."
3,For Practice Only - Too frustrating to really enjoy,"It's a good game to experiment with strategies. But I can't stand it when I go ""all in"" and half the other players call me, even the ones that don't even have a pair, and I wind up losing to a straight or a flush at the river. Incidently, I think that there are too many straights and flushes being made in this game. I think it is difficult to get automated players to behave like real human beings. Still, it's better for practice than playing online, because online, the other players tend to slow the game down too much."
2,Reviewed by y'all way to high!,"This game is marginally better than that Hoyle Casino joke, but it has no resemblance to a real game. The AI is OK, but there are WAY too many great hands, that seem to ALWAYS beat you on the river card. I've played hundreds of hands, and when I cheat to see what all the community cards are I end up missing my straight, only if I fold first. I NEVER hit it when I'm digging for it!!! EVER!!! Can't tell you how many times I've been sunk by a boat when I do hit my flush. Hole cards are awful for my hand, but every one around me is getting AA, KK, OO, JJ, AK. I think this game is poor, and only gave it 2 stars because Hoyle's was my only comparison, and it's palin awful!"
2,Machine embroidery and more....,"This book has some interesting projects but I found them to be incredibly time consuming and lacking in function. A pillow or a quilt that is weighed down with stiff embroidery and beading is not exactly inviting to snuggle with. Don't get me wrong, these projects are original and interesting but I personally feel that if I am going to invest large amounts of time and energy into something, I want to be able to enjoy it afterwards."
5,Great Fiction for those of us who love historical fiction,"I read this book a long time ago, but felt I should review since I've just begun another Costain book. He is a wonderful author. His characters are alive and he really shows what life was like back in these Dark Ages. I recommend this book to friends that I know love to read, and it has caused more than one sleepless night while they try to finish the book. Begin your journey today, and try to find this book if you can. Try the local library."
4,From the good folks at Panola Pepper.,"And this is by far their hottest sauce.A blend of habanero and jalapeno, this sauce is pretty good on chicken and fishand has a good long burn. Now personally, I dont like jalapeno elixirs, but theheat of the habanero masks the twangy flavor of those damn jalapenos, and reallyall you get is the heat with a mild citrus added by the lemon, and a flavor thatis totally unique among Louisiana blends.A worthy addition to any Pepperhead's collection."
2,Blunt tips?,I got these specifically as a sharp weapon but hey...those tips that look sharp in the picture...yeah they're completely blunt flat tips...fail.
2,Not for sparring,This things are pretty good if your just going to use them for a pattern but are not designed for sparring. The handle wrap came off but since the handle has texture underneath the wrap its ok. My problem with them is 4 months after purchasing them(and using them in sparring) the prong broke at the point where it had been welded to the shaft.
2,twist ties?,"The sais themselves were acceptable. However, the black grip is made of a plastic strip, and that gold line you can barely see in the image? That's a strip of gold twist tie. Yeah, the stuff you close the bread bag with.Most disappointing was the fact that water somehow got between the plastic strip and the metal handle, and the sai is rusted for about 5 inches of hilt and blade. In order to make these usable, I now have to scour off the rust and re-wrap the handles with leather. Not worth the price I paid, for a product I have to do so much work on."
4,A good metal Sai set to use in your Kobudo training.,"As a life time lover of the martial arts and martial art weapons, this is the Sai I used the most in my weapon training in the past. I have used these Sai in blocking and catching Bos and Jos and found them to be durable and strong. These Sai are also great for Sai kata practice.There were two minor flaws in this Sai set after years of hard use. One, the wrap would come loose but it was easily repaired using black electric tape. Secondly, the striking of the Sai against another metal training weapon did make deep marks in the long portion of the Sai. However, I would recommend these Sai to anyone interested in learning martial art weapons but they should only be used in conjunction with actual hands-on training under the guidance of a certified martial art weapons instructor.In conclusion, this Sai is a very good value for the price.Rating: 4 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: PR-24 Police Baton Advanced Techniques)"
1,Red Hot Salsa: Intermediate DVD,This DVD is hard to follow. The instructions are not precise and they do not provide step by step instructions. Why would you want to rewind to keep following the instructions...A Waste!
2,Big Disappointment,"This video is too much basic and boring. There are only four or five steps in this video and the steps are very basic and not funny. There are a lot of better videos than this, so if you don't wanna waste your money don't buy this video."
2,Uninspired karaoke?,"I am a fan of Vesta's, and I own a few of her other cds. So I expected more: particularly, some creative interpretation of the songs performed as only Vesta can. The selection of songs is great, but they are recorded with virtually no changes except for Vesta replacing the original vocalists. I'd recommend that you wait and buy this used. Relationships is a far stronger cd. I also recommend Christian McBride's Family Affair, as Vesta puts in a strong performance on ""Or So You Thought."""
3,Vesta - Distant Lover,A couple of songs are good; a couple are just alright; and a couple missed the mark completely for me.
5,Phenomenal! Definetly A Must Have!,The title says it all. I've always appreciated Vesta's vocal capabilitiesand how she's always been able to wrap herself any musical composition. She's proven why she has been able to maintain the longevity as an artist as she have. Now its time for her to start touring again! This is it Vesta!
1,Not Helpful,"My son was having problems dropping his elbow and maintaining a 90 degree angle. I was very hopeful this product would help, and eager to try it. Unfortunately, there are a couple of problems with it. The positioning of the brace itself is not instinctual and it is difficult to position properly. The picture instructions were not helpful. More importantly, though, when we did have the brace in the right position (at least we thought we did), my son found that the most comfortable position for his arm was straight and that the 90 degree angle it purports to encourage was actually more uncomfortable. We stopped using it before he changed his mechanics for the worse."
5,Saving money on prescription drugs,"This book is an excellent guide for people who want to sav money on prescription drugs. It tells you about reduced costs at web sites, about getting reduced prices or free from drug companies, and even mail-order and generic substitution. Each chapter is on a separate topic. And the appendix gives you telephone numbers and web addresses. A great book for consumers."
1,Disk quality was terrible and had to send it back for refund!,I was hoping to replace my VHS with DVD and was excited to find this 3 pack. I was not able to view the movie IQ on two different DVD players because of a defective disk. I requested a shipping label to send it back for a replacement. I was able to send it back but Amazon wasn't able to send me a new DVD and credited my account.
1,"OK Story, Terrible Ending","The plot of this book is pretty typical - poor kid working his way up to a better life gets derailed by the death of his college girlfriend. He gets married to another woman, has a daughter, and things begin to fall apart. That part of the story was fine. The part I had a problem with was the ending, and because of that ending there is no way that I would recommend this book to anyone.** POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT - NO DETAILS BUT WILL CHANGE HOW YOU READ THE BOOK **The ending is so blantantly impossible that it left a bad feeling in my mouth. It is not feasible at all and something I wouldn't accept in traditional fiction, let alone Christian fiction. Don't waste your time reading this book."
1,Very dull book,"I was expecting to really enjoy this book, but it was dry as sawdust and did not capture my attention at all. The story dragged ON AND ON, Alycia sounded unrealistic as a pre-teen in the first half of the book, and none of the characters were very engaging.Also...the ending was completely out of left field. Felt like he couldn't figure out how to end the book so he just picked the weirdest thing he could come up with. Very confusing.I forced myself to finish this book."
4,saving Alice,"I ordered Saving Alice from amazon. This book starts out real slow, but gains interest as you get over into the middle of the book. then the ending is a very big surprise. There was no way that I would imagine that the book would end like it did. Even after I finished the book I kept thinking about it and trying to figure out what the writer was thinking and how he came up with an ending like that."
4,"Solid Rack, Shipped Prime, Good Look","I'm quite happy with the coat rack which I got for $50 shipped with Prime. You can store umbrellas in the lower part. The woodwork is good, though it came a little dinged up by the time it came to me. This thing is designed well and is easy to put together. It is nicer then Ikea furniture:I would recommend this item handily and I anticipate I'll be using the coat rack until I'm 80."
3,Overly Complicated For Such a Simple Topic,"I am disappointed with this book. I have taken symbolic logic, mathematical, et cetera, at university and I found this book to be unnecessarily confusing. I think what Quine was trying to do was teach symbolic logic in a way that would feel less imposing to the reader by using more words than symbols. I don't think he goes into enough depth either. I recommend this book to people who would like this approach, but I think this book is the equivalent of 30 pages of most texts on logic. There is nothing said about A,E,I and O proposition or things like existential import. Don't get me wrong, I think this book is too short to accomplish this; I am not saying that Quine was sloppy. I am simply saying that this book does not teach the bare minimum in the way of preparing someone for what they need to know after a course in ""Introductory Logic."" Therefore, this book suits the needs of very few people."
2,Sorry....,"I didn't check the book, cause I picked the wrong one, and I emailed seller with a request that ""please don't send the book to me, I picked the wrong one"" But the seller still sent the book and when receive the package I dropped it in the mail box noticed that greturn to seller""But I have to say the seller's attitude was good.I am not sure that whether I already took my money back nowThat's it"
5,good series,The first book was the best and bythe tird one it turned more from action to romance which is not true to the original book.
4,Entertainment with Insight,"This ""thriller"" makes a thoroughly entertaining read. And when you are done you will have increased your insight into the present divide between Western and Islamic culture. Enjoy!"
5,Great Action Novel,"I really enjoyed reading this novel. It was fast paced and contained interesting detailed knowledge of military special operations, terrorism using computer software systems, and ideas from the Islamic religion. I was entertained as well as informed."
3,Euro Avante-Garde Youngsters,"Famous for their ground-breaking work on ECM in the seventies, all five members of Jan Garbarek's Quintet sound admirably of-age in this 1971 release. There really are trying hard to be ahead of their time, taking on a project that will set a staple of avante garde in the jazz-rock fusion era. And they all fail miserably. But, there is still some super-cool stuff on this one. It reminds me alot of the bariar-breaking Blue Note records in the late sixties, most notably Eric Dolphy's OUT TO LUNCH and Anthony William's LIFE TIME. This stuff isn't by any means crazy either. It's contained and meticulous. Terje Rypdal doesn't soar on long solos, Chistiansen doesn't flail away on his nice sounding Gretsch either. The keyboardest is phenomenal and Garbarek has the nicest licks in the ensemble. All an all, a nice fresh avante garde attempt from some future legends."
3,Great for First Time Ziggers - Not good if you have other Zig,"I have purchased other Zig tapes and really enjoy them. I thought this was going to be something new. It's not. It is the same stories all over again. I also do not recommend the CD if you are going to be using it as a car audio. CDs can't just stop, be ejected so you can listen to something else, and put back in like a tape can."
2,not very pleased,"The principles are there like many other books but I thought the presentation would be more stimulating, very old fashioned. The tone of the voice of Ziglar could be a nuisance to the ear too, I simply didn't find it worthwhile!"
4,Very Good Guideposts,"Begin with a set of specific written goalsUnderstand the reasons behind your ambitionsIdentify the resources you need to achieve successDevelop a scheduled plan of actionThese are very good basics, basics that people will listen to but winners WILL FOLLOW. They may seem like just mere common sense tips, but if taken to heart, these guideposts will change one's life I believe. I have had problems with my organizational skills and focus throughout my life and throughout my career my focus has been getting sharper, but I'm humble enough to realize that these things can help me.Zig may sound a lot like a TV Preacher, but he is full of common sense that I fear not enough people actually apply in their lives. One needs to get past his southern drawl and to the core of his powerful messages. He is also criticized by some for overemphasizing Christianity, and being overzealous in this regard. I didn't hear him say the word ""GOD"" once during his presentation."
3,Headless Heroes,"Well, I was a big fan of Eugene back in the 70's with Outlaw and Apocolypse. Much time has passed since then. While still edgy, he is not as angry as he was back then and it shows. The music is not as aspiring as then. I recommend only for the most arguent fans."
5,A great entry-level DVD player,"I've had my Toshiba SD2700 DVD player for several weeks now. I hooked it up to my 7 year old 27"" Panasonic TV using the S video connection. The picture is absolutely stunning!! It breathed new life into my opinion of my TV. I also tried a Panasonic DVD player before getting the Toshiba, but liked the remote control and user interface much better on the Toshiba. I haven't really had a chance to evaluate the sound (for movies any way) as I don't have a surround sound setup at home. And with 2 little one's at home, most of my listening is through headphones. However, the N-2-2 technology does seem to provide a sense of surround sound even in the headphones. This is a great player for the money!!"
4,worth the money!,thinner and smaller then most dvd players! highly recommend if space is limited. has great features too!
2,Problem of tick-tick-ticking sound from within DVD player,"On the first DVD I played on the Toshiba SD2700 the picture was beautiful and the sound fine, but on the next four DVD's, as soon as the disc was loaded in the machine, a rapid tick-tick-tick began. It made listening (or watching) the DVD impossible. On all audio CD's the same ticking sound occurred. I have temporarily solved the problem by placing a thick, folded towel over the front and top of the DVD.This is very disappointing in what should have been an excellent machine."
1,Toshiba that gave up,"We had the DVD player for almost one year. It just decided not to come on one day. Unfortunetly, since the labor warranty had expired we were told by a Toshiba warranty center to pay for the first [money]just to open up the DVD player and that it could take 1 week to 3 months to get back. Needless to say we threw the DVD player away since it would almost cost as much to purchase a new one. Check for manufactures that offer 1 year parts and labor such as Sony."
1,bummer!,I bought this DVD player for my husband for Christmas 2002 and it's on the way to the repair shop tomorrow (9-9-02). I would recommend looking elsewhere for a DVD player.
1,NO SOUND AT ALL?,"Horrible! Would have recommended it until today.Sound completely dies for no reason in the middle of a movie. Tried rerouting the cables, using new cables, changing the settings - no luck. Background: Bought it brand new less than 2-years ago, *extremely* light use - one movie a week tops. Picture is still great but that doesn't help.I even have a matching Toshiba TV but now the DVD player is useless...."
1,This Product is AWFUL--STAY AWAY!,"This is a terrible product. It took only 6 weeks of occasional use before the picture quality had completely degenerated into an unwatchable mess of digital interference. The DVDs are clean, the optics were cleaned, and still the player continues to disappoint. My recommendation is to buy another brand--I wish I had. This is the last item I will ever buy from Toshiba."
4,"CDR, VCD and XVCD at 1500 mbps",It does well with CDR and playes XVCD at 1500 mbps+. Does not play SVCD.
2,HDCD incompatibility,"This DVD player has trouble playing HDCDs. I returned the unit back to the store where i purchased it and got a replacement unit, but still the second unit suffers the same problem. I was told by Toshiba to bring the unit to one of the authorized warranty service center to have the BIOS upgraded. i haven't done so, but those who are thinking about purchasing this particular model 2700, consider yourself be warned."
1,Player went dead after 1/2 hour of first use!,"This Toshiba DVD SD2700 played for 1/2 hour then went completely dead! With no power, I could not get the disc out so I had to take it to an authorized dealer just to get it out to return. The electrical unit burnt out and now after 2 weeks in the repair shop the part is still on ""national back-order"" from Toshiba. A very big disappointment."
1,Great... Until it dies suddenly & for no apparent reason...,Add me to the list of poor [people] who owned this product for less than 2 years (but just long enough for the warranty to run out) before expiriencing a complete breakdown. While watching a typical no-thrills DVD I was suddenly left with no sound. Imagine my joy. Choose another unit unless you plan on upgrading within the 2-year lifecycle that many of us have already discovered.
1,Same as others,"I have owned my DVD player for less than 2 years, and this weekend it died. I pushed the stop button and everything locked up. I can now join the mass of people that have had nothing but trouble with this unit. Joy for me!"
4,Nice quality - 2 small drawbacks,"Overall I am very happy with this purchase. Nice quality. Two minor things that bug me: 1. remote [isn't good], cannot use it in the dark 2. no 'time remaining' counter"
2,Great - while it lasted,"When I first received this DVD player I loved it. The price was right and it had all the features that I wanted. Now, less than 2 yrs. later, under normal usage conditions, it's dead."
1,What the...,"It seems a year after buying one of these dvd players the sound likes to just go away. Pretty sweet, sike."
1,"Sounds quite unreliable, regardless of features","Interesting to note that the vast majority of people who give this DVD player excellent reviews ""just got it,"" while multiple people seem to have problems after 3 months. Given that the thing only has a 90 warranty on labor costs (coincidence?), I can't imagine buying this."
1,unable to review,"since this item is apparently available for shipping only within the US, I am unable to order it, even though it sounded like just what I was looking ofr."
1,Yuck,"Over three months, this DVD player's performance has slowly eroded to the point that rental DVD's will almost never play. It is beginning to develop problems with new DVD's also. An earlier review noted these same issues. After contacting Toshiba and waiting on hold for thirty minutes, Toshiba referred me to a mom and pop repair shop. The repair shop would not look at it for a month and recommended throwing the DVD player away. $... down the drain! Yuck!!!"
1,Flawed,"After less than a year of minimal use, the player one night broke down: no sound and a dark LCD display. Now I have to go through the hassle of warranty repair, which involves dealing with rather slow-acting Toshiba service people. Disappointing."
1,"I like Toshiba, but not this DVD player...",This DVD player was fine until sound got completely dead.There sometimes are products that last just long enough to pass its warranty period and go bad. This seems one of those...
1,synergy digital-rapid quick charger,I also bought one of these chargers. It doesn't fully charge the battery.It also doesn't tell you how long it takes to charge. You have to keep an eye on it. The light will turn green when complete.I was able to take 10-2M file size photos and I used the LCD screen. The batteries died in 35 minutes. I wasn't pleased.
2,outdated - needs a new edition,"At two years old this book is quite appreciably dated. It is quite simply not what is was, and desperately needs a review to bring it up-to-date."
2,Dated,"At 2 years old this book is getting visibly dated. For that price I need a new updated edition, sorry."
2,Sleep Please,"This one caused me some trouble. I guess it was hard to read since I had found out so much about the Player's Union in other books. It was interesting to find out exactly what happened, but it was too much in the end and I really just did not care anymore. I fell asleep sometimes and missed sections, but if you are into this sort of thing, I would say go for it."
4,Steamy romance in Louisiana!,"I read lots of trashy romance novels, because my job is very stressful, and they're a good way to get away from that at night. This is one of the better ones I've read for a long time, although I wouldn't go so far as to give it five stars. I probably like it because of the setting, more than the story.Set in Louisiana, Ms. Wood does a good job of bringing the steamy romance out of the bayous and plantations. Her characters are strong, even the women, and she actually touches on a serious subject: Anorexia. Barely touches on it, though. I just wish more romance novelists would use American women, instead of English ones. Don't they think American women have romances, too?"
3,"Not bad, but not great either","While the book does have a lot of diagrams that are clear and often helpful, they sometimes must be so at the expense of textual content that is very muddled, overly wordy, and difficult to follow. Topics are often discussed in an indirect, roundabout fashion that makes comprehending what the author is trying to say more of a challenge than learning the embryological processes should be. I find myself constantly becoming frustrated at having to read over passages two or three times just to figure out what exactly is going on - much more so than with any other text I've yet to come across in medical school.Get Langman's instead, if you have the option. Much clearer and more concise. And funny enough, a lot of the better illustrations in Carlson cite being adapted from images previously published by Langman."
3,so-so,"I teach developmental biology and study invertbrate devlopment and evolution. For my course I use Scott Gilbert's excellent text and teach my course as a general introduction. I just became pregnant and purchased this book to exapand my knowledge on human development.I'm rather disppointed. It's not detailed enough and while the illustrations are nice, there are several diagrams that illustrate paracrine factor targets but are never mentioned in the text or explained. why diagram them then? Even more disturbing is a underlying teological bias that many intelligent designers would salivate over reading. For instance page 209 ""a master blue print"" is used to describe the interactions of several tissue types to form the limbs. It's disturbing to think that our MD's might be using this text for their human embryology courses- its a very basic pass frought with poor word choices that would satisfy any creationist."
3,Visual Learner,"Fawnia says it herself. ""If you're a visual learner this video will be a lot of help to make you a very successful entertainer."" And that's probably the real problem with this video. There's little explanation of how best to do the move. When teaching the hand on butt move, she doesn't even start at a sideway's angle so that you can see where her hand is. And once she finally took it at a sideways angle she was going into an entirely new move.I have to say a lot of Fawnia's outfits during the travelling sections were so gaudy they were annoying. Definitely a distraction from trying to watch her feet move."
2,Not for me!,"I was dissapointed in this video. I thought it would be more instructional than it was. This DVD was more of a show DVD. It showed the girls dancing and pretty much doing the same thing over and over again. If you are looking for step by step guides, this is not for you!!!"
4,"My wife loved it, and so do I! :)","my wife decided to treat me to some of these exotic moves after studying this amazing DVD. and i have to say, she did quite well...actually, that's an understatement. we had to put the kids to bed early, if you know what i mean. ;) anyway, i watched it too and Fawnia is a great instructor but even better to watch. She's extremely sexy and makes you want to learn. I highly recommend buying this for your girlfriend/wife if she is open to it. it really can bring you closer together. man, she really knows how to strip and fawnia helped."
1,I thought it would be better,"I order this dvd thinking it would give me some pointers on how to spice up my love life with my husband,like being able to learn how to give my husband a good private dance or show. But nothing!!!!I thought it would teach me something!!!It seemed like it was filmed back in the 80's, had horrible music, and was really boring. I never would have wasted my money on this dumb whatever you want to call this art of exotic dancing dvd."
2,Dance moves,"This video was not very helpful for real women. Was sleezy, not sexy styles, and seemed more a mens entertainment movie, not instructional for real women."
1,Amaturish garbage,"This video, and it's sisters in the series all look like they were filmed in the garage. The information was not overtly harmful, but the presentation was so bad, I had to turn it off. They're all in the trash, now, where they belong."
5,An absolute classic...his best album!!!,"God bless Terry Reid!This album, the follow up to ""River"", incorporates so many musical styles, Funk, Country, Jazz, soul ""whatever"".... into a seemless perfect album.An album that finds our Terry in great voice (as usual) with his, often ovelooked, guitar skills in great shape too.The inclusion of a pedal steel via Al Perkins, adds so much to the overall feel and depth of the this great album.Finally those harmonies, where Reid is joined by his old buddy Graham Nash,...""Phew"" stunning to say the least!! I could go on and on.PLEASE,just go and buy the album already! Like NOW!!!"
5,Ridiculous Album,"This album, for me personally, ranks right up there with Led Zeppelin I-IV, the Beatle's White Album and Sticky Fingers from the Stones. I think it has to be the most slept-on classic rock album (and artist) of all time. Terry really came into his own on this album with some much more well-contructed songs. He knows exactly when to take over the track with that always right-on-key raspy yell, but his guitar work is what sets this album apart from Rivers, Superlungs and Bang Bang.I can't say enough about this album. Every song is a classic, my personal favorites being Seed of Memory, Brave New Awakening, The Frame and Make Me Feel So Young. This album will never get old. Buy it if you like any classic rock at all and you will have something to show your friends that they will thank you for forever."
5,The seed of memory,"I courted my wife to the music of this LP the better part of thirty years ago. It was, and is still one of finest collections of ballads and truth's recorded."
3,"Enough biography, not enough philosophy","This book presents a very passable biography of its subjects, Popper and Wittgenstein, but only a cursory overview of their philosophical views. I had hoped for a closer inspection of their respective philosophical positions. This is a shame, too, since the authors write with admirable clarity.The principle disagreement between the two, as covered in this book, was whether there exist real philosophical problems (Popper) or merely linguistic puzzles (Wittgenstein). But what does it mean to claim that, say, the question of free will is a linguistic puzzle? This book brought me no closer to understanding Wittgenstein's position.It's worth reading, but only as an introduction."
2,Suggestive but not conclusive,"The book provides a lot of biographical information about Wittgenstein, Popper,Russell and a whole host of other people associated with the event. However, it glosses over their ideas and only presents them as compared/contrasted to the movements with which they were associated.The history leading up to the meeting is interesting but is presented in a somewhat scattered way. And while it does give a a great deal of insight into the personalities of these men, it never really gets into the philosphy too deep. In that sense, it reads like an A&E biography. An intriguing bit of fluff."
4,Very Entertaining Story of Two Very Interesting People,"This book is a brief autobiography of two major figures in 20th century philosophy, both before and after the only time they ever met (the eponymous poker incident). I have a big interest and a pretty solid background in western philosophy, so I was familiar with most of the names mentioned in the book. Anyone who was not, however, might find this book much less interesting to read than I did, since much more time is spent explicating the story and the temperaments of the participants rather than discussing their ideas in any detail. The best part about this tale is that it places European philosophy in the rather ugly context of 20th century Europe. A fascinating read for anyone with the background knowledge to really get into the story."
4,Where's the poker?,"Could it be there was no poker? No one knows who did what with it, no one can describe what it looked like, and it subsequently 'disappeared'.The cover artwork (see the top of this section) is of a rather fancy toasting fork - just adequate for toasting crumpets, and quite useless for poking fires. The photo on page 277 of my copy shows a much more substantial object - certainly a poker - but oddly the handle is in the fire and the working end of it is in the hearth.Lots of symbols and no substance. A King's College hoax? We should be told."
2,unsatisfying treatment of Wittgenstein and Popper,"I probably echo a lot of reviews on Amazon when I claim that this book is treats the philosophy of Popper so lightly that there's little mystery why books like this do not get written about modern academics very often. The authors do a number of things well: they portray post-war King's College, they show how Wittgenstein's students reverence for their teacher, and they illustrate Bertrand Russell off to the side, not being of much consequence. That being said, I really did not get a feel for what Popper and Wittgenstein were arguing about, what their lives' works were, and after all these years, who turned out be in the right. If one wants to find out what modern philosophy ""is like,"" this book does not seem to be much help.This is an attempt to popularize a core conflict in modern philosophy, without all that bothersome thinking. I recommend Magee's ""Confessions of a Philosopher"" or Scruton's ""Modern Philosophy"" as alternate choices."
4,Can Stories Of Fencing Philosophers Be Falsified?,"Wittgenstein's Poker by Dave Edmonds & John Eidinow, a distant cousin to The Metaphysical Club by Louis Menand, is a good book, but not a great book. The book is a parallel biography of two of the most important philosophers of the 20th Century, Ludwig Wittgenstein and Karl Popper. The book starts with the one meeting between the two philosophers, which ended with Wittgenstein wielding a fire poker at Popper. I was originally going to give the book a full 5 stars, but I feel the ending let me down. I was expecting the authors to tie all the disparate threads followed in the book together better than they did, but was disappointed when the book just whimpered to an end, especially after such a clever beginning. I would still recommend the book to folks interested in philosophy, Wittgenstein, Popper, and the history of the first half of the 20th Century. If I could, I'd give the book a 4.4 stars. ..."
3,Good but unsatisfying,"This was a fun read and I devoured it in about three days. It provided fascinating biographical and historical details and it was decent overview of the philosophical issues of the time. Yet I came away feeling a little short-changed. The book didn't offer a very clear view of Wittgenstein's philosophy, how he used it and how he applied it. The same perhaps could be said of the book's characterization of Popper but I knew much more about Popper coming in. Finally, the book never really provides a blow-by-blow account of the argument -- Popper said this, Wittgenstein responded with that, Popper replied thusly, and so on. It seems like that at least a speculative paraphrasing of the argument would have been possible given the research the authors did. I was disappointed they didn't even try. All I came away with was a general idea of what the argument was about -- philosophical problems versus puzzles -- and the atmosphere of the scene at Cambridge. I wanted more."
4,A book of personalities,"A student of philosophy will find this book interesting for its descriptions of prominent personalities (including Russell), but this book does not contain any particularly profound discussions of philosophy. The ideas of both Wittgenstein and Popper are given a shallow explanations; in addition the basic ideas of some other philosophical schools that came and went are discussed. However, the lives of these men are interesting, and the the author's commentary on the historical importance of the ideas of these men is also interesting. In addition this book gives Wittgenstein fans some helpful information on the evolution of Wittgenstein's ideas that may not be apparent from the paucity of documents that comprise Wittgenstein's writings."
4,its good but...,"its good but i didnt beat the game, so i thus didnt use the whole stragey guide so i dont know since i didnt dive into it that much"
5,"Violet Flame To heal Body, Mind and Soul","This is a wonderful introductory book for learning about the power, purpose and use of the Violet Flame. If we are to usher in the Golden Age of Aquarius then we need to understand the significance of the Violet Flame and why it is imperative that we start to use it daily."
3,Check the dimensions,"This book taught me to look at the book dimensions before buying. It is very small; what I would call a ""pocket"" book. There was some information in it that was interesting, but if you have already studied chakras, energy fields, and the like, you may not feel you are getting your money's worth considering its meager size. I sure don't."
5,Violet Flame to Heal,"This book will truly inspire you to go inside yourself , realizing your have, without a doubt, a flameof pure intent at the very core of your being. It's a light, yet more like a flame that absolutely does notdie out at any time. It is God-given. It is actually the cause of all creativity, it is the pure energy of heavenitself. Becoming aware of this, as you meditate and contemplate on this Truth, can make you want to shoutfor joy to your Creator. When you are praying for someone , give thanks immediately that he or she alsocame onto holy Mother the Earth with this fllame and that it is this that unites us all in a divine unity.Love this gift in yoursellf! Feel chosen. Love all that is."
5,healing ones world,"Beaitiul book that teache us how to change our world, how to forgive others, and transmute our karma and the karma we have with others, just as the book say how to heal body, mind and soul"
3,Not The Best,"I was assighned to read this book for school. At first, I was really exited because my friend said that it was really good. The plot seemed to be building up to something in the end. It turned out to end without enough action.KING OF SHADOWS is about this boy actor named Nathan Feilds. He, for a reason that will be revealed in the end, went back in time to 1599. He got switched with another actor with some theater company, also named Nathan Feilds. He was being 'borrowed' by The Chamberlains Men (Shakespeares company) from that theater company, because they didn't have enough actors.You won't really know the reason or quest Nat was supposed to complete until the last few chapters. The ending was cool, but the rest of the book was lacking adventure and action. All in all, I thought that this was a pretty good book, and I think that a lot of people liked it. You should read it and see what you think."
3,Good for young teens doing Shakespeare for Englsih,I would have to say that Susan has made this book to be a real help in helping teachers. I'm using examples out of her book to help me with an english exam 2mmorrow and she's greatKristy H
2,King of Shadows,King of Shadows is a fairly good book if you like fantisy that takes you backward about 100 years ago in England. The story is about a kid named Nat. Nat is a actor that goes to England to act in a shakespearean play. Then out of Know were he gets very sick and goes to bed. When he wakes up he findes himself 100 years in the past. He meats shakespear andlots of different things happen to him. If this sounds interesting to you read the book and find out what happends to nat.
5,great book,I got this book for my son for his kindle. He had a school assignment and he ended up loving this book.
4,Hal Leonard can't tab....but RATM can Jam!,"This is a great book, the tabs aren't all right, but unless your Tom Morello, you will never be able to tab it right anyway......read the lyrics, they actually mean something....."
3,It's the only way.,Tom Morello has specially made guitars and equiptment to play the great sounds that he does. Hal Leonard is trying to make a normal guitar sound like one that's been sooped. I am thankful that I can at least play some Rage.
2,Way to short!,"I was looking forward to reading this book, but it was not much more than a high school research paper"
1,Don't waste your Money,Please do not waste your money on this book. This isn't really even a book. It's more like an essay and boring at that.
3,La Madrastra ?!,This Telenovela is ok. A bit is on the nerves whom one must wait to see the murderer weir and I think the title of this Telenovela not so well!
1,DVD w/3 discs,"One of the three DVDs was loose in the case, because the holder was broken. I'm a collector and I don't like broken things. I should have sent the product back.Either the product was not packed for safety, or the person who packed it just didn't give a damn that the disk was loose inside."
3,GP,this was great but it was so edited...i saw the telenovela on tv so i know which scenes they cut off...but its good that they cut off fill in scenes. Some important plots points were lost with the editing..All in all though i thought it was great with the scenes which were included.
1,help!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Does it come with english subtitles???Please let me know,i love novelas but always a problem no subtitules,thanks for help,it does look good so........ just didnt buy yet"
2,"The main theme song, ""Viveme,"" has been replaced.","For those of you wondering whether Laura Pausini's signature theme song ""Viveme"" is included in this DVD edition, it is not. It has been replaced by very similar-sounding MIDI music.I personally didn't mind the edits; however, one pivotal scene towards the end of the novela's run has been inexcusably shortened. [SPOILER ALERT: A heart-wrenching scene in which Maria's children discover that she is their mother was edited without explanation. The powerful scene, as originally aired, showed the climax of Maria's story as her children went through the stages of denial, anger, and final acceptance. The DVD version hurriedly skips over the surprising revelation, and the viewer is left to conclude that the children accepted her immediately while the storyline continues elsewhere with ""business as usual.""]As a bonus, LA MADRASTRA: AÑOS DESPUES is included in an edited format as well, tying up loose ends after the finale of the main telenovela."
4,La Madrastra,Was a very exciting dvd. Just as the real long version cut the parts that weren't important. Very nice...
2,FISH is better,"If you're looking for a book that will give you a concise and easy to remember strategy for integrating work and fun--FISH! is the one I'd recommend. In FUN Works, the author presents ELEVEN principles that are supposed to help us ""understand the importance of the Fun/Work Fusion."" With eleven principles, this book is all over the place, and somehow misses the mark. I fervently believe that work should be FUN, but I didn't find this book particularly helpful in understanding how to make it that way."
2,just eh....,"i unfortunately didn't get much from this book.it basically looked at different companies that have a so called 'fun' work environment. basically, the message was hire the right people with a good attitude, trust them, let them be themselves, and get out of there way. yes, that's good advice, but a whole book on that?i guess i felt like i read this entire book waiting, page after page, to discover some hidden treasure of ideasneedless to say, i never really found it.as i read more book in this same genre, i'm getting the feeling that i'm being had. someone as one or two ideas, then they write a entire book around it. but most of it is fluff.i'm still searching for a good book that has solid creative ideas for how to have fun and reward employees.it should have been a tip off for me that the last review was in 2007, over 3 years ago."
4,Have fun while you work,"Begins with an ominous warning by ancient historian Herodotus. ""If a man insisted always on being serious, and never allowed himself a bit of fun and relaxation, he would go mad or become unstable without knowing it."" The rest of the book is an attempt to prevent these dire things from happening especially in the workplace. The book is bubbly. Bubbly excitement prevails. But near the end, the author cautions us that, ""excess is too much even when it comes to fun"" And I'm sure a man as smart as Herodotus would also say that if you have fun all the time with no seriousness at all, that could be dangerous too."
5,Easy to follow,"Though people may say this stuff is full of ""soft skills,"" this book is full of great, practical advice about making your workplace more ""user friendly."" I hope there are several more in the making, so that we can buy this type of book rather than the endless CEO-in-jail titles now being issued by greedy publishers. When will it end? I guess never, since those creeps will have lots of time behind bars to give us more apologies. I, for one, have had it with them and have told my broker to dump any stock with associations to creeps running WorldCom, ImClone, MarthaStewartLiving, Tyco, RJR Nabisco, Adelphia, ad nauseum. I urge you to do the same."
4,Do we have to hate work?,Read it after listening to the interviewon First Voice. Not a subject you hearmuch about.The interview is online athttp://www.7to7.net/yks.htmlThere's a transcript for those using dial up.--J. R.
3,Why must we all hate work?,Good book. Read it after listening to the interviewon First Voice. Not many people talk about this subject.The interview is online athttp://www.7to7.net/yks.htmlThere's a transcript for those using dial up.--J. R.
1,Fun Works: Creating Places Where People Love to Work,"Bought this to help with an employee who was having troubles getting motivated. Before giving it to the person, I read it and was thoroughly not impressed. Don't waste you money or time on it."
3,Found some gems but it took some work,"I'm sure this book was fantastic when if first came out back in the 1940's, but there are way better resources today that provide the information you seek without putting you to sleep or boring you with irrelevant topics on outdated technology.If you don't mind a dry read (I fell asleep ever five pages) and have read all of the other books there might be some gems in here worth checking out. Otherwise, I'd say save your money and buy something more applicable to farming in the new millenium."
3,Textbookish....dry,"Good info, but too textbook-ish for me. It is a true classic tho in the information given. Perhaps a bit outdated, but if you are looking at survival in the future, it may help to have the classic info on the shelf."
5,This tome will nurture your green thumb and love of animals.,"Consider me a baby boomer in search of enlightenment as Ipursue my families love of nature, plants and animals. Withgardens, designer compost, exotic animals and plants invogue, this book presents compelling food for thought.I planto breed exotic animals, birds, and herbs. M.G. Kains pointsout the pivotal financial, business, and general managementaspects to consider. So if you want to raise herbs on alarge back lot, sell designer compost, manage pheasants orgoats for restaurants, or simply run a 2 acre mini-farm,this reading will bring focus to your dreams. Happy growing!"
2,"A good read, but do get more updated information before acting","As others have pointed out, the lead-lined cistern is a classic example of bad information. Heck, it was controversial at the time even. None of the financial information, obviously, is at all useful today. The animal practices are still plausible as I understand it, especially the chickens, but much of the tree management details differ from current best practices. So, if you want modern information, this isn't it. I'd recommendThe Urban Homestead: Your Guide to Self-sufficient Living in the Heart of the City (Process Self-reliance Series)for the urban gardener, and perhapsThe Self-Reliant Homestead: A Book of Country Skillsfor those with more land."
5,A definite win!,"You'll realize right away that it's a little dated, but that's fine because you'll also realize that ultimately, what was true then is still true today when it comes to living the simple life. Definitely worth the buy if you're looking to make the jump into the country life as I am."
2,Too many goods books to waste your time,"I'm noticing lots of titles similar to this lately, and thought an older copy would be interesting. I was wrong. It was not out of date enough to be entertaining from a historical point of view. It was not modern enough to be useful."
3,"Interesting, if a little dated.","A lot of the information in this book is outdated, however, it is still very interesting. There are many useful tidbits as well."
5,An excellent guide to the realities of a small farm.,"I have a 1946 edition of this book which my father used as a reference in supplying our family all of our food from 1948 until 1962 and a large portion of our food thereafter. I have referred to it on a regular basis since 1972. While the precise numbers for costs and quantity of production are dated, the basic principles for successful small farming are clearly elucidated. You can update the costs and quantities yourself. Some of the information on animal breeds should be updated by additional research. But the priciples are all here. The chapters on ""City vs. Country Life"" and ""Tried and True Ways to Fail"" are essential reading if you have never been involved in agriculture previously. I have many reference books, and this is one of the best...with a tattered cover and yellowed pages!"
2,A Let Down,"I was looking for a book that could give me the ins and outs of a country property today and how to make it productive. This book, however, is more of a look back at farming in the 1940s and did little to educate me on what to do with our small farm.If you are looking for a period piece, this might be an interesting title to read. On the other hand, if you are looking for modern advice, there must be better books out there."
3,A decent book in the spirit of O Henry and A. Hitchcock.,"I really love Roald Dahl, but this book is my least favorite. His short stories are constructed with wonderful and ""unexpected"" twists. Written several decades ago, the stories are still higly relevant.If you're looking for good characterization, don't read this book. Dahl's characters tend to be quite one-dimensional in these stories. This is particularly true with female characters.The book begins strong, but I found myself grateful when I reached the last story. While most of the stories are good and worthwhile, a few are downright boring."
2,Unexpected and stupid,"Review to Roald Dahl's three tales of the unexpected!The unexpected has been well chosen from Dahl but that doesn't mean that this must be used in a negative sense. Like he does! All of the three stories have a foolish and pessimistic end, which you would never expect. The first story tells about a couple, where the husband died. He wanted to live on and so he followed the instructions of the doctor and allowed, that the surgeon takes out his brain of his head as soon as he died. The joke about this story is, that his wife who was always against this idea and she wanted at the end even take the brain home. And Dahl uses so many medical expressions, that you nearly fall asleep by reading it. The second story we don't even remember, what it was about! The third story is even more macabre than the first one and we would never recommend it to people who are still a little bit normal!Olivia & FabienneIf you want to tell us your opinion write to: bianco@mails.ch"
4,An unforgettable and gripping book,"I first read this book 10 years ago, and now I can still vividly remember some of the stories. Roald Dahl has become one of my favourite authors since I started reading his books. I sincerely recommend this book as a starter."
5,a great read,"I enjoyed every story in this book. My favorite was Parson's Pleasure. I was laughing so hard, I had tears coming down my face. Lamb to the Slaughter and Royal Jelly are great too. Dahl is a pleasure to read. Try reading some of his sentences out loud. His adult books are just as great as his children's books."
4,"Slyly shocking, yet refined","An intoxicating blend of literary and genre fiction from Roald Dahl. I'll be buying volume 2 on the strength of volume one. I read ""Man From The South"" nearly twenty years ago and have never forgotten it. Imagine a master storyteller relating a hair raising tale in very calm and matter of fact tones and you get a good idea of Dahl's ""voice"". The most fantastic premise seems plausible when Dahl is relating the details. ""Georgy Porgy"" is phenomenal, as is ""The Sound Machine"". ""William and Mary"" is another eye opener (read it, then excuse my pun). If you think Dahl is a ""children's author"", think again. Highly recommended."
4,THRILLING,"We really liked reading this book. We admire the fantasy of Roald Dahl and about his black humor we had to laugh a lot. But sometimes he writes in great detail and the story becomes too long. We read this book at school and otherwise we read here an other kind of books. So it was refreshing to read something different. The first moment when you read this book you think its a total non-sense. But then, thinking about it, you see a message. Every story is a metaphor. The title fits because the end of every story is very surprising. We can recommend to read this book."
2,Okay if you've got absolutely nothing else to do,"I ussually like Roald Dahl but this one just doesn't follow in his other books greatness. For one thing, the charecters stunk. Each one seemed to be alike with the description he gave. Also, it was written so long ago that it is very confusing, and has no relevance to everyday life. This book draaaaaaged on. It seemed like an eternity before I was done. One last thing, is it just me or was this book twisted? Do i really want to know what happened to the skin of an old guy? Uhhm, i don't think so."
2,Nonsense,"We find this book has no sense and that's why we have given this title to the text. The story is very cruel and bloody: We are not very religious but it is against every understanding of moral and ethics. All the endings are pig dummy and absolutly stupid. The only plus point the ends have is their surprising character. We were shocked about Dahl's ideas. How is it possible to have such a morbid fantasy? In a way there are good parts, too. The situations are well described and you canreally imagine the scenes. We don't recommand this book, however, because you can use your time in a better way. Carpe Diem! authors: 2 lovely students from cheesy Switzerland"
4,"Great Style, Easy To Read","This may seem like literary fiction and Roald Dahl's style is extremely polished, but it's not difficult to read at all. Like O Henry, Dahl's short stories have gripping plots and a twist at the end. The author seems to be fond of betting. Quite a few of the stories revolve around bizarre bets.My favourite tale is Lamb to the Slaughter - a murder story and how the frail and semingly harmless victim concealed the murder weapon. Most of the stories live up to their claim of being unexpected, but not everyone is great."
3,Three Tales of the Unexpected,"In fact , a book worth to read , to read with pleasure. We felt throbbing by reading the three short funny tales about some interesting aspects about life and death. On the one hand a surviving brain and on the other hand a vegetarian who dies in a packing-house, we really adore those special ideas, which gave us a lot of information and made us laughing. It was exquisitely funny to read and we have to recommand it to everybody who is not too tricky in that black humour. The way Roald Dahl describes his exagerated ideas full of details let them show truly. thank you Roald, we're your fans! martin and matthew from aarau, switzerland"

1,SHORT BULB LIFE,I purchased this bulbe for a floor lamp that required a F552D/830A bulb. It was used very little and only lasted a little over one year! This is a F55W2D/830 bulb and should of worked for many years. I am going to try the required F552D/830A bulb instead of this one for a replacement.
2,Early failure of the bulbs,I bought two bulbs. One of them last only about 45 days. The other one is still working. We hope it will last longer.
3,Too Bright,if your looking for romantic light bulb this is too bright on the dimmest settings. I had to put my terrible towls over my lamp and it is still too bright.
1,Don't Buy This,"The people at Office Depot don't have a clue about how to ship glass. It came in a box with no padding beneath the item, and some paper on top of it. Needless to say, when I received it, it was smashed, and I'm still dealing with them on how to get properly credited.This was a nightmare. Never again."
1,It burnt out in a day or two.,It worked for a day or so. Now it is useless. Is there a replacement for thisd bulb that will work?
2,F552D/830,I bought this replacement lamp 2D 55W Joyful Daylight 120V AC.The original GE bulb had a much warmer color and make the room verybright and yet comfortable. This replacement bulb is not recommendedand *do not* waste your money to get this bulb.
1,Don't buy these.,"All the packing material was on top of the 2 bulbs, one of which was broken. The paper said, ""contains mercury dispose of properly"". So I get exposed to mercury. Not what I wanted.Does not even go into a normal bulb socket."
2,Color temperature too blue,"While the bulb works fine, the color temperature is way off (5000K?). The light output is bright, but it's too blue for use indoors. The original GE bulb had a much warmer color to it (about 2700K). Beware you are not getting a genuine GE light bulb here.You get what you pay for."
1,Still in the dark,We are disappointed. The lights are the correct fit for the lamp but none of them worked. When you moved the bulb you could hear a rattling noise (possibly a pin??). So now we have opened all 3 packages with no success and will be sending back.
2,turns off after sometime,Sometimes the bulb turns off after it has been on for awhile. First the light dims and then it goes off completely. When the lamp cools off it can be turned on again. Will need to replace it with another model.
5,As advertised,"It's a light bulb, what can I say ... it fits the funky torchiere that I own, arrived well-packaged in fine condition, and worked flawlessly."
2,Terrible reliability,Bought this bulb and it worked great... for 35 days. After the 35th day it burnt out and doesn't work any more. Maybe I got the oddball lemon but buyer beware. This is not a quality product.Amazon's return policy is 30 days but their excellent customer service offered to replace the bulb for free. For that I will give this product one extra star. Thanks Amazon!
4,Fits my no longer available lamp,"It lights up and fits my no longer avaialbe lamp. So what's not to like?And what gives with the death of the flourescent lamps? I don't want halogen as they use up too much energy. I have 4 in my house and they are all at least 5-7 years old or older, and I know they won't last forever. Bring back the flourescent lamps! Or, make effective and affordable LED lamps. I don't want to have to buy halogen lamps!!"
2,Dog destroys fish,"My dog and I absolutely adore JW Pet Company's Darwin the frog.JW Pet Company Darwin the Frog Dog Toy, Large (Colors Vary)It easily withstood the jaws of my mutt. However, the fish did not last more than two minutes. My dog easily managed to rip apart the conjoining section between the head and the tail and subsequently demolished the remaining portions. I wouldn't recommend buying this item for a determined chewer. Instead, purchase the company's frog and give your pet a toy that he will enjoy for weeks, not for a mere few seconds of destruction."
2,I expected better,"I bought this item because a dog friend has this toy and it's the hit of the dog park! The small end makes it easy for large and small dogs to run with it in their mouths, while the large end is good ""bait"" to start a chase or for the larger dogs to steal it. The squeaker isn't terrible and it's not going to pop out easily like other toys.Unfortunately, the item I got is not of the same heavy material that our friend's ""Fish"" is made out of and is not holding up to our one dog, never mind the crowd at the park.We have other items from this company that are made of the heavier rubber, and that's what I expected for the $$ spent. Your dog will love this but don't leave them alone with it or they'll chew, and you probably don't want to take it to the dog park."
2,Dog did not like,"This toy is well made but did not appeal to my dog. He is 90lbs but the medium size was large, possibly too large for him to enjoy. Will donate to shelter."
3,"Great keyboard, but overpriced.","We have an old machine that requires a PS/2 keyboard with the built in trackball (or touchpad). Unfortunately there are not a lot out there, so we are relegated to spending $75 for one. They work well, but I just wish they were more reasonably priced."
2,Mouse not responsive enough,This keyboard is OK- much better than my old worn out one but the mouse is not responsive enough. Very draggy. Wish it was better. I use this combo of keyboard and mouse as I have limited space. I plug it into my laptop. I probably should rate it as 2.5 stars.
1,Be Forewarned,"The title of this atlas is somewhat misleading. The maps only show ground operations. You could go through the entire manual and never guess that the Air Force or Navy ever participated in the European and Mediterranean theatres. The large sized maps appealed to me, however, this atlas is to be used in conjunction with a West Point textbook and is a little use to a World War II buff. Shop elsewhere."
3,Incredible picture / sound - poorly built,First of all let me say that I am MORE than pleased with my purchase of this product from a viewing standpoint. Picture and sound leaves me speechless. I found myself going back to watch movies I haven't seen in ages. I you have a TV that supports the progressive scan feature of this player you should not be disappointed!My problem with this player is apparently the poor construction. I had the player for 55 days and the power supply went out. The company autorized service center I took the player to for warranty work said he averages at least 1 call a DAY to fix a Toshiba player. It took 3 weeks to get the parts needed from Toshiba to fix it. I tried to contact Toshiba 3 times for advice and never got a reponse. Incredibly poor customer service.I'm more than happy with the purchase when the player is working. Maybe I just got a bad one and I'll have no more problems...let's hope. Keep this in mind when deciding on a Toshiba however.
4,Super Video Player,"The 4700 is as good of a DVD player as one could want with all the features you need. The zoom is great you can use just enoughto change all those widescreen films to full screen. I can't comment on the DVD Audio side, but for regular cd its a good player and for most probably a great player, but for a high endaudio system its just ok. My six year old Micromega stage 2 cdplayer blows it out of the water on CDs, but I still love this machine and can't wait to hear DVD Audio discs"
2,Rest In Peace,"Procured: November 2001Disposed: March 2004It was a work-horse while it lasted. DVD's still look terrific, but CD's no longer play. It does not pay to repair the unit.To Toshiba: Unplugging the unit did not work. Two years plus 5 months is too young to malfunction. For shame."
2,Nice player-fatally flawed,"All the glowing reviews are true as to picture and sound; but the player has no onboard dts decoder. This would be just an inconvenience, were the player not set to output the dts sound out the 5.1 analog out section, as digital noise! This means, if you are listening to a DVD Audio disc, and switch to a dts disc, such as Toy Matinee, and you forget to switch the receiver to another input, you will get the most awful, speaker ruining, ear shaterring noise imaginable. Imagaine 1000 fax machines amplified by 1000. The machine, should cut out the dts signal from the 5.1 outs. The machine is an accident waiting to happen."
4,70's California country-pop,"These are the last two studio albums from one of the great blue-eyed soul-singers. The above reviewer feels her voice is unexpressive. Nothing could be further from the truth. Jackie possesses one of the truly great instruments in popular music. That said, these songs are mostly laid-back, and don't possess the passion and energy of her finest performances. There are some great moments though, and anything by Jackie DeShannon is worth having."
3,It Might Work,"The user can olny reset this product once, and after that (two 31 day cycles)it does not work, battery or not.It seems to add a small amount to the interval it allows between cigarettes, instead of developing any relation to the user's pattern.I don't think that it is worth the money."
2,Probably not for working people.,"I know a few people who had success with this and quit smoking, permanently. After the first week, it has learned when you smoke. For the next three weeks, it tells you when you can smoke. At my job, I can't always choose when I can take a smoke break...or I may be in the middle of cooking dinner at home. Didn't work for me."
3,TUFF,"I HAVE USED LIFESIGN WAY BACK & IT WORK'S WELL,,,,THIS ONE IS MUCH EASIER TO USE & CARRY BUT LET ME TELL YOU , SMOKING IS HARD TO STOP & THIS GADGET WILL WORK IF YOU HAVE THE WILLPOWER TO FOLLOW THE PROGRAM,,,, IM HAVING TO START STAGE 2 OVER & I WOULD SUGGEST MAKING SURE YOU HAVE A STRESS FREE MONTH TO USE THIS - MAYBE SOME KIND OF NICOTINE GUM WOULD HELP,,,ONLY BAD THING IS THIS CAN ONLY BE USED 1 TIME THEN ITS WORTHLESS & FOR THE MONEY I THINK YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE IT AS MANY TIMES AS IT TAKES,,,,,GOOD LUCK"
4,It could work...,"This product works as advertised and will work for some smokers. However, I found it difficult to stay with the program. You still have to have the drive, motivation, and desire to quit by following the program. My Doctor advised me I had three weeks to quit smoking and quit caffiene! I ended up retiring the device and used Nicotine Snus to quit.Cons: The alarm notification needs to be much louder or must be clipped to your belt loop so you can hear when it's time to smoke. If you cheat too much, the device starts your next day at the previous level.Please note: The device only allows you to use it's program twice and then you will have to purchase a replacement."
2,Disappointed,"After only 2 days of use my QuitKey started having problems. When it came time for the QuitKey to beep and tell me when to smoke..It never beeped! I think for $60.00 it was cheaply made, and that's to bad as I think it would of been a good tool to help smokers quit. I would not recommend this product."
2,Ambiguous and Lacks Organization,"To learn the details of GSM, this is not the book to choose. The text contains a vast amount of information but not in a manner which is readily understandable. There seem to be holes in the explanations and, in some instances, contradictory statements. After two days (well, one was a Friday so maybe that doesn't count as a whole day) of trying to make sense of the chapter on logical channels and frame structure, I am at Amazon looking for an alternative.This book makes me want to learn enough (from some other source, of course) to write my own book."
1,Not Mac OS X,"This software is advertised as Mac OS X, but it's not. It's for the older Mac OS7.1 to 9.x OS.If you have the OS 9 install disks you can run the older software in emulation on OS X, but it's not true OS X."
5,Very Complete Kit!,"I was surprised to see that this kit even had the little, quarter-sized circular filter/catcher. Top quality fiter kit and nice price, I would definitely purchase this item again! Vacuum working like new, now."
4,pleated circular filter doesn't fit,"I own a Bissell Powerforce Bagless Turbo sweeper. I bought this filter set which states that all of the filters are style 12 filters. I just received it and every filter fits except the pleated round filter with the hard plastic frame. The hard plastic frame is too big for the place I need to snap it into. It came with the extra foam filter that wraps around the pleated filter and that does fit over my old one. I guess I will order a separate pleated filter unless someone know how to get that filter out of the other frame so I can put into my old one. It appears to be one solid piece and I can't get it to come apart. Still a good filter set, I just wish it had the right pleated circular filter for my vaccum or at least mensioned it in the discription."
1,Pleated circular filter does not fit PowerForce Turbo Series 6596-X,"The base of the pleated circular filter is too wide to fit between the indented plastic fingers of the cyclone bowl, despite claiming that these replacements are for the PowerForce Turbo Series 6596. See attached pictures.The other filters fit perfectly, but I suggest purchasing another kit or purchasing the filters individually."
2,Johnny Cash Christmas Let down,Very disappointed in this CD. Some songs were not Christmas and some weren't even done by Johnny. Very blah!
5,My Mom Loves This,I bought this for my mom as a Christmas gift but gave it to her early and she absolutely loves it. I recommend this to whoever loves Johnny Cash and Christmas songs.
3,Nice gift item,for a friend from Brazil - many familiar artists. Should buy a second copy for myself - too bad there is no download copy.
4,Good,"Bought it as a gift, it was really apreciated by the recipient, a lot of classics from brazilian music by very good singers."
4,All the Hits (Almost) and Then Some,"A good alternative to the many Shirelles collections out there, gathering the contents of a half dozen French EPs and one Swedish EP. All the biggest hits are here, and many of the lesser ones; the only notable hit missing is their first, ""I Met Him on Sunday"". It's a treat to have several usually uncollected album tracks and B-sides, and most of them are worth collecting. The sound quality varies somewhat from track to track : although it's always very good its a cut below the Varese Sarabande anthology. The liner notes (history of the group)are very good and pictures of a variety of EP covers are on the front cover and inside. Oddball track : the theme to the film ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"", with verses in several languages, including Japanese."
2,Not what was expected,"When I purchased this book, the description said ""like new."" It was far from that! The cover was ripped up and there were all kinds of marks and highlights everywhere in the book."
1,"Great player for about a year, then it dies","I bought my RP-56 one year and two weeks ago. It has stopped paying discs. I now see an error message ""H02"" and the player stops. I did some searching on the internet and this appears to be a very common problem with all Panasonic DVD players. As faras I can tell, only Panasonic can make this repair. H02 indicates there is a ""spindle server error"". The disc doesn't spin. I tried taking the case off and helping the player start by giving the disc holder a spin with my finger and that actually makes it work! Luckily, I purchased the extended service option, so I can still get it serviced for free. ... I will not buy another panasonic DVD player and would not recommend it."
1,H02 Message on Panasonic DVD Player,Absolute worst DVD player. I bought a Panasonic 4 months back and watched around 40 DVDs. Now I am getting a message H02 and DVD player stops. Panasonic customer is the worst. They will not tell you what the error means and asked me to take the unit to an authorized service center which is 40 miles away...I can buy a new DVD player for [the price of repair from the service center].
2,Rick,"Purchased RP56 about 3 years ago for $120. It has operated w/o issue until today. Got the H02 error like everyone else. The player was subjected to moderate use (2 DVDs per week average)so, I was expecting it to run a few more years. I will avoid Panasonic DVD players. I think LG is their parent company, so I will be cautious with that brand as well."
1,Disappointed,"Great DVD when it works, but it broke in 12 months!!! No picture output. Probably only played 20 dvds during that time. Now its an expensive CD player!! Not recommend it."
4,Does the Job,"I'm no techie. All I want from a DVD player is a steady picture and a nice stereo sound. This does the job. It has only two shortcomings of which I'm aware: There's no volume control; my TV remote does fine; and machine displays disc time remaining only on VCDs and CDs, not DVDs. This is somewhat annoying, and had I known it I might have opted for another player. Otherwise, I'm pleased."
1,DVD-RP56,"Panasonic - what a junk!. Don't touch with a 30 ft pole unless you want to pay more to repair stupid ""H02"" error than the cost of Panasonic. Stay away from Panasonic."
2,Capable but Cheap build or defect in drive,"This was a great unit, while it lasted. I was amazed at the picture quality and progressive output of this tiny player and I though I got a real bargain .... A little more than a year later the drive mechanism started to fail. It took forever to eject a disk and eventually the drive could not load and track a DVD. I would have giving it a 1 but I may have just got a bad one. Still it indicates a [poor] drive which can't be good."
4,It's been great so far.,"I bought my DVD player October of 2001 primarily because of the video quality in S-VHS (I don't have a component video TV) and MP3 playback for CD-Rs. It has worked well since then. The VCDs I've made with my Mac work great. The DVDs I've made with my Mac work great. Yes, the quality of the mechanics is pretty lame and the unit weighs next to nothing, but I do take care of my gear. I have yet to encounter the ""HO2"" spindle motor error complained about so often. The unit is slow to power up and eject the tray and the remote is pretty lightweight, too. But then keep in mind how much this unit costs."
2,Glad I bought the ESP,"I don't normally purchase the ESP plan when I purchase electronics, but for some unknown reason I did with my RP56. Glad I did. This will be the second time I've had to bring it back. HO2 error this time, was HO6 last. It's also had episodes where it's refused to read a DVD on one day, then it's fine with it the next. No the DVD was in perfect condition.Works great, but only when it works."
1,"bought in Dec, Dead by Feb","what a piece of JUNK! We got ours on in early December and it lasted until mid Feb. In less than 90 days, we got the dreaded ""H02"" error. We replaced it, got the same error code on the new one. I will NEVER waste my time or money on a Panasonic product again. We actually had better luck with an Emerson. It may be a ""Blue-light special"" and doesn't have all the cool bells and whistles, but it worked for several years and didn't cost nearly as much! (by the way, don't even bother trying to get Panasonic to help. They apparantly don't like dealing with customers' needs)"
1,HO2 Error - Like Everyone Else,"Just like everyone else, I had the Panasonic for one year trouble free and then HO2 error and it is a doorstop.They should have to recall this product. This error code is all over the Internet. Everyone is having this problem.I cannot recommend Panasonic for this reason."
1,"Nice features, broke after 5 weeks","Before purchasing this product perform a google search with the following words 'Panasonic DVD H02' H02 is the error message you get then the word stop. The DVD is in need of repair and the Panasonic customer service center will do nothing except point you to an authorized service center. I got 5 weeks, watched 3 movies. Read other reviews stating they did good and only got this error after 8 months when 4 is typical. I wish I would have done a little more research before purchasing. The Panasonic Customer Service Center is the absolute worst !!! I will avoid Panasonic based on my experience."
5,AWESOME PLAYER!,"This Panasonic RP56 is not only the best player (or one of the best players) out there for the price, but over all it's one of the best! The picture quality is outstanding; it plays audio CDs just as good as any CD player, especially the CD-Rs and CD-RWs, which some DVD players have difficulty reading!! The controls are user-friendly and easy. It's a compact and lightweight space saver!! Overall, a big winner!!!"
2,Broken,"I purchased this product in December and two months later it was broken. It no longer ejects or plays DVD's. The picture quality was good, the sound quality was good, durability is horrible, customer service was horrible."
1,"Great player for about a year, then it quits working","I bought my RP-56 one year and two weeks ago. It has stopped paying discs. I now see an error message ""H02"" and the player stops. I did some searching on the internet and this appears to be a very common problem with all Panasonic DVD players. As far as I can tell, only Panasonic can make this repair. H02 indicates there is a ""spindle server error"". The disc doesn't spin. I tried taking the case off and helping the player start by giving the disc holder a spin with my finger and that actually makes it work! Luckily, I purchased the extended service option, so I can still get it serviced for free. I bought this player for $..., back on 9/2001, and paid $... for a four year service plan and dang it, I'm gonna use this player for the next three years! I will not buy another panasonic DVD player and would not recommend it."
2,No Zoom--Letterbox [or 4:3] only on a regular 4:3 television,"After reading the other 2 reviews raving about the quality of the progressive scan, I rushed out and bought this thinking I would be ready for I upgrade to widescreen HDTV. Unfortunately, this DVD player will ONLY play a movie in [either] the letter box mode [or standard 4:3]. You cannot zoom in (I thought all players did that?). On a conventional 4:3 aspect ratio television, I prefer to view a DVD somewhere in between letter box & full screen. Therefore, I'm returning this."
1,obsolete,"Mpeg3 may have been great but new MPEG4 and Portend are the future. Instead of 5.1 ratio new receivers are going with 6.1 and 7.1 to handle DTS and THX.It may be a good close out item but will not stand up to the march of newer better technology.Handset remotes need to be IR,illuminated and capable programmable code because most user have cross branded home theatre systems.Give us what we need and we will buy it.There was information released today on a new type of algorithymThat is 4 times the capacity and better contrast with higher quality sound and permiits CD copying for Pay on demand DVD movies and 7.1 aspect ration sound(3 front, 3 rear and 1 center speaker that puts you in the orchestra and scene. All you need is a script.Who knows someday we may be able to have a Web cam and audio input(Kareoke style) thata puts us in the movie."
4,"Kingston, Micro 1GB SD card w/ adapter (SDC/1GB-2ADP) (Retail Package","i got this for my nokia n75, its working great with no problemas of this time. i got the package bec of the adapters its much easierdowlowding the pics to my computer, fast delivery"
1,Darn You LG,"Well its a great buy how ever not compatible with my LG CU500Says Card Not Ready meaning the card isn't being read.How ever, great for backing up files from pc.Good Buy just not for LG CU500 Owners."
5,"Great price, great product!",I love that this memory card comes with sizes and I can use it in my phone or camera!
5,great buy!!!,I definitely recommend this. It's a wonderful bargain for such a versatile SD. it has adapters so that you can use it in a variety of differnt devices.
4,WORKS ALMOST PERFECTLY,I HAVE WINDOWS XP MEDIA EDITION AND IT RECOGNIZED THE CARD FINE FOR MY NOKIA 6133 AND I TRANFERED MY PICTURES AND MUSIC AND VIDEO FILES TO THE CARD.. SINCE I ADDED THE PICTURES FOR SOME REASON MY PC DOESNT RECOGNIZE THE CARD ANYMORE.. SO I DONT KNOW IF ITS THE MEDIA OR THE CARD AND THATS WHY I GAVE A 4....
3,Kingston 1GB,"The card works great. I just don't care for the adapter. I didn't really need it. But it will be great when using it on my computer.This is a good product. The memory works fine. My only concern is that the Micro SD package is almost too small to handle comfortably. It is awkward to manipulate and if dropped, could be difficult to locate. It would have been fine with me if manufacturers had stopped with the Mini SD and not shrunk to the Micro SD"
3,"Works great, but don't care for the adapter.",The card works great. I just do'nt care for the adapter. I didn't really need it. But it will be great when using it on my computer.
4,Design issue,"Entirely satisfactory product. However, I fail to see why both adapters take the MicroSD card. It would have been more useful and clever for the SD adapter to take the MiniSD adapter."
5,Kingston Knows Memory,Kingston is an industry leader in memory products (all of my computers use Kingston memory) and I have been using their memory cards for a couple years as well with great success. I have yet to have a failure or data loss with any of my Kingston memory cards.This 1GB MicroSD card comes with a two different adapters - full size SD and MiniSD - so it will be usable with all card readers that are compatible with SD. It also includes a nice case that holds all three.You cannot go wrong with Kingston Memory Card Products.
4,Good Piece,The product worked as desired. It came along with all its adapters that enabled to interface with my laptop. The flash card was good and worked reliably
1,don't bother,"I bought this video to learn some moves to give my boyfriend a lap dance. This video is a joke ... it gives you tips like ""keep moving"" and ""touch yourself"" ... rent Striptease with Demi Moore and you will learn more. Hope this saves someone from spending their money."
1,Not Impressed,"I bought this DVD thinking it would give me some good ideas and show me some new moves... I was wrong! I would have to agree with the other reviewers that only one of the dances was somewhat informative/interesting. The rest were slow, boring and repetitive. Definitely NOT worth the money! I thought this DVD was going to be about giving your b/f or husband an intimate, very sexy lap dance, but a lot of it was about dancing at a club, and the guys receiving the dances didn't look too entertained. There were many times I wanted to turn the DVD off, but I kept watching, thinking it would get better. Sadly, it didn't. I don't recommend this for anyone, no matter how much experience you have. You'd get better ideas from watching a music video on MTV."
1,The art of exotic dancing,It isn't what I was expecting. Actually the cd is more like a video of people dancing. It does not teach step by step how to lap dance.
1,Waste of money,"I bought this for my wife, hoping she could learn some skills, but instead spent her time being bored, and fast forwarding through the DVD. This DVD seems like it was shot in the early 90's and seems like it was shot mainly for stripper, but I doubt any stripper would ever watch a DVD on pleasing a client.Save your money, and buy your female a membership to a pole dancing studio in your area."
3,only the second 1/2 worth watching at all.,"The first half was sleezy and terrible dancers, didn't learn much. The Second half had some better teaching for everyday women entertaining thier own man."
3,kylyn,"Now this is some really old stuff. Sometimes S Watanabe's stuff would be greats, sometimes it would really suck. The playing is excellent as is the recording technique but it remains on the cold side overall."
1,Save your five bucks.,"I figured I'd try this CD out -- after all, it's inexpensive. Unfortunately, it is bad.The CD has only one track that is just over 58min long. The first 5 minutes (maybe more) is occasionally punctuated by some horrific creature that screams like a crying baby. Startling is an understatement.The rest of the CD is low quality recording of a babbling brook which occasionally fades to one channel (as if you were turning away from the brook) only to suddenly jump back to equal volume in both left and right channels.The final conclusion: avoid this CD like the plague."
4,Demo,"Very good demo. she showed color use and the paper each time. Would suggest to others, great for beginners."
1,DO NOT BUY...,"I bought this MP3 as a replacement and regret making the decision. It was cheaply priced which made it attractive but what it did not get in the purchase, it has more than made up for in how it goes through batteries! I can say it is ""the gas guzzler of MP3s"". The program it uses WMA which makes it easy to load and has a stopwatch that is useful in the gym. The controls are located where any bump can stop or pause the music if you carry in your purse or pockets; overall not worth the investment."
1,Not hassle free!,Buyer beware. Read COMPLETELY when and what you are getting and how much it is. Very confusing and Amazon does not help when the hassle arrives. The Flying Noodle can't be trusted either for their 100% satisfaction guarantee. Don't expect much when the cheese does not arrive. Even if they send you a notice it has shipped they find a reason to look good to Amazon in their correspondence. Can't tell you how the cheese tastes because it never came!
4,Great For Die Hard Fans,"If you are a die hard Keith Jarrett and/or Jack Dejohnette fan and pretty much want everything that they have recorded like me, I would reccomend this.You may need to listen to it a few times to get in the groove with it. Keith is playing electric piano wich is unusual to hear for me, but very interesting. His flute pieces are always a real treat. It is an adventure to listen to!If you are new to Keith Jarrett, I would reccomend any of his solo or trio works before you try this one. Jack Dejohnette is always a treat to listen to!"
3,huh?,"I bought this CD thinking there would be some nice Hammond action here mixed with some acoustic/electric piano blips here & there + some flute. What did I get? An album with the following: lots of piano with some very sparse, light NON Hammond parts. Plus, there is hardly a solid beat work quaking about! But still, I guess sometime I might be in the particular mood for an album such as this. So I won't sell it."
3,Buy my CD!,"If I had to sell one of my 46 Jarrett recordings this would be the one. For sure! Sorry, but I do not understand it, and never will. Maby some one can help me finding KJ on this album?"
3,Future shocked at how ridiculous,"I really enjoy Keanu Reeves in everything he does, but this one is crazy. The story's ridiculous and it's played too seriously to be good. Ice-T is cool as usual and you won't even recognize Dolph Lundgren. Oh well, can't all be hits."
2,"I know it's fiction, but the plot connections still need to be logical!","Johnny Mnemonic, with Keanu Reeves in the starring role as a human ""courier"" for secretive information, stores coded data in his brain until it can be downloaded. If it's not removed, then it is lights out for Johnny.Oops! Lost the code.Then there's the awful looking porpoise, and the weird looking people that can't push the right lever but seem to be able to maintain and operate extraordinarily complex devices.D'oh!I'd wait for Data before I trust sensitive material to Johnny and his friends."
1,"Brilliant premise, appalling film","This road kill is the result of a three-way collision between an inexperienced director, an under-cooked screenplay, and the early ""acting"" of Keanu Reeves. Irredeemable on almost every level, it's truly notable for two things: it contains some of the most poorly written dialogue ever screened (the ""I want room service!"" speech will have you hiding under the couch); and it goes off the rails quicker than ""Showgirls"". Keanu blows his first line - ""We've got ice"" - and it's all down hill from there. Reeves has improved immensely, and director Robert Longo is probably still in therapy, so perhaps we'll never see its like again. Like most people involved in this, they both claim it was destroyed by studio interference and panic-stricken re-editing which undermined the narrative structure. But it's hard to believe it would ever have been good. Avert your eyes and move on. There's nothing to see here."
4,Turn your brain off for maximum enjoyment and to prevent seepage,"A fine slice of visually interesting B-movie cheese that is consistently fun and never drags. Come for the yakuza enforcer with a laser-whip thumbnail and Dolph Lundgren as a theatrically overwrought priest-assassin with a crucifix dagger, stay for the climax where Keanu enlists the help of Ice-T and a cyborg ex-military dolphin to hack his own brain."
2,Keanu Reeves is likable almost always but this isn't even as good as 'Plughead Rewired: Circuitry Man II',"A bit disappointing, in that it was supposedto be of the same vain as 'The Matrix'. Cir-cuitry Man, with Vernon Wells, filmed in 1989and released in 1990, beat this type of Sci-Fifilm to the punch. C.M./P.R:C.M. II does muchmore with less - as in less budget. Reevesshould have instead done 'Point Break II'!!"
1,bad quality,"no widescreen and looks like a copy of vhs put on to dvd.extras, what extras.cast bio of 4 actors wowwaste of money."
2,"ALMOST AS BAD AS ""EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES!""","Keanu looked great. The opening scene with him in black silk boxers in a king-sized bed with black satin sheets was worth the rental price for me. But good looking actors and above average special effects don't make a bad movie into a good movie; there has to be a plot! The plot is completely unbelievable and boring. Why would anyone want to put ""life saving, priceless information of any kind"" into someone's brain to deliver it top secret? Kill the guy and that solves the problem! It would be easier and more effective to just save it on a disk and ship it UPS!I give it one star for Keanu's and Dina Myer's performances (she is also great in Dragonheart with Dennis Quaid by the way!) and the other star is for the special effects.A movie has to have an acceptable premise or it will flounder. Unfortunately, this movie did just that."
1,Brain Seepage - It happens,"Got to watch this for free--it was worth the money, but not my time. I had heard this was a cult classic. If yes, then it is for people that love Napolean Dynamite and B-grade Sci-Fi. Can't touch Blade Runner, Matrix, Terminator or any of their sequels, Excalibar, why, even Krull kicks Johnny's [...]. The one star rating is for seeing Flipper again. It's been a long time."
2,So-so sci-fi with laughable Lundgren...,"It is the year 2015 and somehow our planet has become a ""Blade Runner""-ish post-apocalyptic world. Secret information is handled through mnemonic carriers, people who store the info in their brains. Keanu Reeves plays Johnny, a carrier who stumbles upon a package that could save the human race. But that's not all: a group called the Yakuza and a crazy priest are after his head! Perhaps the only reason to watch this movie is for Dolph Lundgren as the priest. While his screentime is very limited, he's a very memorable part in an otherwise forgettable movie. As far as cyberpunk goes, ""Johnny Mnemonic"" could work if there was more action. That's not to say it doesn't work; this movie is very watchable. But it drags a little, especially at the beginning and the action is not very exciting. As a ... B-movie, this film is not that bad. As a big-budget thrill ride, this movie needs plenty work."
1,"The WORST movie I have EVER seen! A Stupid, Pointless Bore That Put Me to SLEEP!!","I saw this AWFUL excuse for a movie in the theater in the Spring of 1995, and to this day I consider it one of the WORST movies I have ever seen (to date) and an ABSOLUTE waste of the cost of the ticket.I don't even remember now (it being over a decade later) why I even went to see it.But I do remember how stupid and boring it was and how I kept dozing off throughout this sorry excuse for a film.Looking at some of the other reviews I can see that there are others who consider Johnny Mnemonic one of Keanu Reeves's biggest flops.I like Keanu Reeves, but he should br embarrassed for being part of such a waste of people's money and time!If I could give this movie NO STARS, or NEGATIVE STARS, I would. But I can't on this site, so I'm giving it 1 star, though it deserves much less!1 STAR!!!!!!!"
2,One problem with this movie...,"It's not Keanu Reeves' acting, but rather that the screenplay was written by the author of the short story. And it just doesn't seem to be up to the quality of most of his work. It is disappointing because it could have been much better."
2,The MATRIX it AIN'T,"I actually liked this film when it came out but seeing it again this past week I was struck by how flat Reeves' performance was. He is so very good in ""Speed"" and in the ""Matrix"" films... but in this one, he is really weak and uninteresting... and knowing how good he can be, I can only blame the director. This was a good story, but poorly transcribed for the screen... and though the special effects were good for their day... those are pretty dated by todays standards. See either MATRIX film instead and leave it go at that."
3,starts off good but...,inventive sci fi movie that is highly entertaining but takes on too much and loses it's way by the end. Worth seeing.
5,Johnny Mnemonic is a great Movie from a great short story!,"The movie has a different argument than the short story, but it's great too!It's cyberpunk classic.Long life and prosper to William Gibson."
3,Widescreen/Full Screen Warning,"As another review pointed out, this version (ASIN/ISBN#0767802454) offers no Widescreen version of this movie.The box clearly says ""Side A is a Widescreen version and preserves the original 1.85:1 theatrical aspect ratio. Side B is a Full Frame/Standard version and is re-formatted to fit your TV."" One Problem; ASIN/ISBN#0767802454 is a single sided disk.The other production run of this movie on DVD is ASIN/ISBN#0767802462, and may include a Widescreen version. I can't verify that because it is out of print.Bad job Tristar home video....no biscuit."
1,Worst Movie I have EVER seen,"Some reviewer wrote - Any movie that features both Henry Rollins and Ice T and Dolph Lundgren and a Dolphin in a tank with computers wet-wired into its brain can't be all bad.Uhhhh are you kidding me? - That is very definition of bad.Johnny Mnemonic is the worst movie I have ever seen. Not only is the acting, plot, dialogue, and directing terrible - but in the end the whole world is run by a FREAKIN DOLPHIN. A big plastic looking fake dolphin. I want my money back. I want a letter of apology from everyone even remotely involved in the making of this piece of trash. And the executives who green lighted this movie should be fired. I would rather have 10 root canals than see any part of this junk again. If you like this movie, you must be really high or really dumb."
1,Poor transfer,A dark and murky transfer. There is some digital noise visible in soe of the scenes. I was disappointed because this film is a guilty pleasure.
3,"Good movie, terrible video copy","I loved this movie back in 1997 on VHS, so I bought the DVD, but it looks as if they just copied the VHS straight onto a DVD. There are small black boxes flickering around on the screen and white pixels flickering in other spots. Maybe this just can't be viewed on a 60"" hdtv."
4,Good action movie,"This a pretty good action movie, futuristic in nature, with a plot that is OK. I enjoyed it. Does have some bloody scenes if you are concerned about that sort of venue but overall it is a fun movie to watch. It is in the mode of ""Blade Runner,"" ""Logan's Run,"" and others of the genre. If you liked those you will like this movie."
2,JohnyGluebag,"****this review is NOT for the superbit version*****The 2 star rating is not for the movie, but the fact that the description on this site says its widescreen; it kind of sucks when you get the movie in the mail, it says on the movie case its widescreen, yet its full screen, not much you can do.Can someone at Amazon change the product description to reflect whats going on? It would help out."
5,The best,"This is one of the coolest movies. I dont know what everyone was on when they saw this that made them hate it, but I think its great. People fear what they don't understand or is different."
3,a great chance at something new wasted and by the creator no less,"william gibson's short story comes to the screen as just another over blowen action movie and the reason is gibson. he adopts his own short story and fall into hollywood land with a thud. he had a chance to really bring his ""cybrepunk"" story to the screen and do something great but the action movie he came up with isn't it. i liked the movie as an action movie but it was easy to see where it was going and i wanted more from gibson. maybe i just wanted to much because it does give you some action that is pretty good but it could have been great. nice try but no cigar. keanu reeves is very good as johnny but he has nothing to do. check out his ""speed"" to see him in a better light"
2,A See-It-Once Film,"I don't recommend buying this DVD. It's the type of movie that you might watch and enjoy once or twice, but never again. The script and plot are both kind of bland -- a typical world-is-going-to-end sci-fi plot. Keanu Reeves also has a less-than-stellar performance, but it's not his fault -- the script really gave him nothing to work with."
3,William Gibson Short story about a software courier,"Keanu Reeves uploads encrypted data into his modified brain as a high-tech courier. Apparently he has a low capacity brain, because he had to wipe out his childhood for less storage space than I have at home. With the Yakuza, a cybernetic Dolph Lundgren (who barely deserves mention) and an evil corporation on his tails, a group of ""underground"" doctors try to salvage the cure to an international plague from his decaying (overloaded) brain. Amusing note -- the ""plague"", Neural Attenuation Syndrome, is simply humanity's over-exposure to technology. More technophobic BS.This movie tries to do a lot of things and fails. It fails to be the feature-length version of the short story. It fails to be epic. It fails to be soul-searching, but succeeds at being preachy. It also fails to be entertaining. It's just a horrid script, and the movie is generally low budget."
1,Not good...no logic to it at all.,"I love Keanu Reeves, but the story was awfully convoluted. Didn't make any sense (example; Johnny complains that he's got too much data jammed in his head when in actuality, he's the one that demanded it be ""jammed"" there in the first place). Not even the special f/x could keep me interested. Better luck next time."
4,"""Cyber-Thriller""?... Definately Techno-Thriller...","This movie is a very good one, if your looking to get into the Gibson style of ""Cyberpunk"", stories and movies. After all William Gibson started it. Though the future is sure to turn out differently, this movie could be considered a forewarning of what melding men and machine will do. Especially when wealth and power is stuck in-between."
2,Watchable goofiness...,"Before hyper-cool cyberpunk flick ""The Matrix,"" there was ""Johnny Mnemonic,"" also starring Keanu Reeves. This film has an interesting setting and background, taking place in the future where a disease is wiping out the population and one man holds the cure downloaded in his mind. However, the film fails to realize just how cool of a premise it could be and we are thrust into a laughable story with corny dialogue and bad acting. Dolph Lundgren makes a fool of himself as a mercenary priest out to kill main-character Johnny. The action in this movie fails to generate anything exciting and the script fails to give us characters to care for. The movie is watchable for the most part, but it lacks drive and flow. It's mostly disappointing."
3,Cyber punk lives on..,"This is a good Cyberpunk movie. Its dark and gloomy in the future where there is a sickness that is caused my radiation from all the electronics everywhere. Jonny has a hard drive in his head that he can hold info and this time has the cure to the sickness. He just doesnt know it and the people who developed it want it back...after all, it means mucho dinero. The decayed cities are well done...the compueters everywhere is neat. Good average movie to try is nothing else is avaliable. END"
1,Avoid this item...,"I bought one of these, and it's defective. I'm sending it back. Considering that other customers have posted similar complaints, it seems like Philips has a problem with getting these things to actually work. I recommend not buying."
5,very comprehensive,had this book for my phonetics class. has chapters on all setsof sounds. very easy to understand. very helpul with glossaryand appendixes.workbook goes along with the book.
1,Won't Play on Sony Media Player,Will not play on sony media player although it has the amazon prime application. Whats this all about? Please advise if this can be corrected. Thanks loyal amazon member.
5,If you want to laugh your guts out...,"This is really a stand-up comedy masterpiece!With his incredible sound effects and quick-thinking, if your laughter lasts more than a few seconds, you might loose two or three jokes in a row..."
3,Funny,"Pablo definitely knows his stuff, and the material here is fairly funny for the most part. Be warned though, he uses a TON of profanity in here. Seeing him on TV, I thought he was relatively clean. That's not the case. Most of his jokes rely on profanity for the punchline. To see a much better job done with a lot less language, get anything by Brian Regan."
5,Suggestion,"If you would like to see Pablo Francisco live with new material, he is touring and can be seen at local universities and comedy clubs. Mostly new material, but some old stuff with other stuff added on to it. I saw him live and laughed for a straight hour. Great comedian, not so much for the kids, but the funniest comedian I have ever seen."
4,. . . almost a crash course in Catholicism,"Greg Tobin is a fine writer with the keenest of eyes towards setting and character. Conclave, the newest novel by Tobin, is gripping -- unsparing in authentic detail. Indeed, the book is almost a crash course in Catholicism, here, in Conclave he has given us a story of a young priests humanity and morality Tobin brings the atmosphere of a place to his literary table better than many writers. The readers are transported to this place, seeing what the characters see, breathing the same air... promises made, loves realized and the haunting memories of the Vietnam War... as well as promises kept. The book works magic with clear and crisp prose, drawing the reader deeper and deeper into the story...a truly believable and heartwrenching tale..."
1,P-U!,"Wow. Not quite what I was expecting, stay away if you think you're going to get info on the actual upcoming conclave selecting the next pope.On it's own terms (beyond what I thought I was going to get), it's still amazingly poorly written. Sorry!"
2,Not sure if I am being genrous,"The song ""Swingset Chain"" was inserted in my mp3 player when I initially purchased it.I listen to all kinds of music, so I am not biased.This song is just dull."
3,title of review,"Take It Back starts out as blah indie-folk with faint ambient-electro backing which reminds me of The Verna Cannon at their blandest, then the chorus is dominated by unexpected electroclashy synths. It's ok, but not great, and it doesn't measure up to the songs on their old ep. Slow Fast Wait & See is better. Reminds me a bit of Jenny Choi/Sanawon and Tanya Chua. Rocks is a downright crappy song, easily the worst so far. Reminds me of Bettie Serveert at their worst. Need Air is another totally weak song which reminds me a bit of Bettie Serveert and Fiona Apple. It's Yours To Keep is a decent but blah electro-acoustic indie-pop song. The first two songs I heard seem damn good compared to those last three. The band made a good call about which songs to post mp3s of on their site. This album is pretty disappointing considering the potential they showed on their debut ep."
3,its like another chill cds,the music its too similar and without emotions.i was waiting a better cd but i am disapointed.
2,Big Dissappointment,"I was quite impressed with this unit until I tried to play a fourth tape. That's right, got to play three tapes for my 160 bucks.Apparently the drive belts have started slipping on both wells. Usually starts a couple of minutes into a tape and usually clears up right at the end. In between is barely recognizeable as music. Cleaned the heads, retensioned the tapes on other decks - no go. All the tapes that won't play correctly on the JVC play just fine on two other older, cheaper decks."
3,small and fragile,"the knife is small, very very small, and the tips break off on the first stab of anything harder than air. the sheath is crappy and the knives don't like to go in it."
5,hot shot,The Yomega hot shot is a awesome yoyo the sleep time is 30 to 40 seconds . the first day I got it I could do a trick and tha was the first time I used a yoyo in a long time.
5,Great Yoyo!,This is a fantastic yoyo for advanced tricks. It's well balanced and looks great! I've found it to be very durable too.
2,"Not a good value, wrong description","This is a yoyo I got to practice with my son who has Maverick.Pros:- Looks good and works nice out of box- Has metal parts around the bearings and the axle, so it should not fall apart easilyCons:- It is plastic on the outside, so if you hit the concrete or tiles it chips easily, possibly could break- After two days developed noise. My guess is due to bad bearings, lubrication did not help- It does not come with 5 extra strings, only 1 extra string (false advertising)- It does not come with spacers (false advertising)Conclusion:My son's Maverick works like a charm and it is full metal yoyo. So, don't think twice - spend extra couple bucks for the real thing."
3,EH,"I really dont like this yo-yo. When I was in a talent show it wouldnt sleep and the crowd got completely bored. Then i got the Dash. The Dash is the most reliable yo-yo i have. The next year i entered that same talent show, used the Dash and won."
3,great but not durable,"This yoyo was very fun to play, long spin, good shape but it's already broke at the center in one day.But I like this Yoyo!!! Very easy to play for beginer or advance trick"
2,Broke 1st day,This toy is not durable at all and is not fun at all because the 1st day it broke so i wouldnt recommend it it stinks
2,TRIED TO ELLEVIATE GUILT IN WOMEN AND JUST LEFT EXCUSES,"I realize that the Proverbs 31 woman is awe inspiring, but she wouldn't be in the Bible if she weren't someone to emulate. Mrs. Courtney seemed to give excuses as to why and how we can't be like her, sooth our frustrations and give us very watered ways to improve our pathetic lives. This book was ineffective and unhelpful. It didn't make me want to be like this beautiful woman - only how to make excuses for myself as to why I can't."
4,"The Movie ""Gandhi""","The pictures in this book are wonderful. It is truly amazing how much time and effort and wheeling and dealing (almost 20 years) went into the making of the movie ""Gandhi"". There were so many plane rides to India and the U.S.A. from London that this alone must have consumed an enormous amount of money.But Mr.Attenboroughs' first dream and priority was not money, but to make the movie. And really what a movie it is! It is definitely one of the true classics of all time. It entertains, it teaches, it inspires! I just wish more of the story of the actual making of the movie would have entered this book. Interestingly enough the actual filming in India took only 120 days."
4,It certainly is not a pop album,"I can't really understand why people feel this is The Doors most pop oriented album. It is actually very similar to Strange Days in the fact that it is psychedelic. Yes The River Knows, Summers almost Gone, and The Unkwn Soldier are all great. As are the less psychedelic Love Street, Five To One, and the signature song Hello, I love you which is pretty pop sounding. All the other songs are pretty good with the exception of Not TO Touch The Earth, i really do not like this song. Then there is Spanish Caravan which i think is the album's best song and one of The Doors' best.ALl Together this album isnt as consistently good as every other doors album exceprt for The Soft Parade which this beats out slightly. Then again every Doors album is great, and this is an excellent output from one of the greatest rick groups ever. If you like a strange, slow, haunting but mellow music this album and all Doors albums are for u."
4,Spanish Caravan is SO good!,"Although not one of the band's best works, definitely better than 'Soft Parade' and contains some excellent pieces, such as ""Spanish Caravan"", where guitarrist Robbie Krieger stands out playing flamenco guitar.Also worth noting are the closing track and classic ""Unknown Soldier."""
2,Hello I love you,"To me this is not one of the better Doors recordings. The best thing about this CD is the first song, ""Hello, I love you."" LOVE that song! It goes downhill from there. Especially when it comes to the back to back ""Summers Almost Gone"" and ""Wintertime Love."" This is just kind of a mellow Doors album and I really love the Doors when they did ""Break On Through"" and ""Soul Kitchen"" and ""Roadhouse Blues."" The more rockin' Doors is what I like. If you are into something mellow, by all means lay on your couch and chill to this album. I wish ""Hello, I love you"" could have been twice as long. It is a great song, but very short. At least on this re-mixed version they let it go on a little longer."
1,Remixed!!!,"Yes, the sound is great but the tracks are remixed, often with new vocal and instrumental parts. These are NOT the original mixes. Caveat emptor!"
2,Not To Touch This Album You'll Be Happier,"I was so dissappointed with this album. After ""Hello I Love You"" it took a nosedive which they didn't recover until ""My Wild Love"" one good accapella song. Then again they fell apart until ""Five To One"" which is one of my favorite Doors songs. ""Love Street"" is about as uninspiring as ""Pleasant Valley Sunday"", ""Not To Touch The Earth"", and ""Summer's Almost Gone"" are very depressing. The rest are there taking up space."
5,Waiting for the sun,"This has always been my favorite Doors CD. Remastered to 24bit 96Khz At last, you can hear what they sounded like without the muted, lousey compressed sound of the old CD.I own the double CD mastered at Digital Magnetics [digital noise] temporarily. Even vinyl on a cheap record player sounded better. I'll never buy another CD that isn't 24 bits or at least mastered by Bernie Grundman. He is a legend in the industry with just cause. I also bought Strange days and am going tonight to sell my Best of... and get LA Woman."
2,Remixed for modern ears,"This album, like all the remixes, is way over produced. There's reverb cranked up like crazy. Jim's voice is double tracked in places where it wasn't before. Stuff that was not meant to be heard in the original (like morrison humming in Wintertime) is mixed up to the front.The new mixes lack the power of the originals. The Doors were a live band and this stuff lacks that sense of a live, raw performance. Like many ""special editions"" that seek to ""improve"" on the original, I can only hope that the originals will remain available along side the new takes. In a few years people will want them as bad as they want the untouched Star Wars movies now."
4,Hmmmm...pt 2,"As with my review of Morrison Hotel, I just prefer to leave things as they were. Just my personal taste I guess. With that said, nice to have Celebration of the Lizard in it's ""infancy"" here. I've only heard the live cut from the original Doors Live album from many years ago."
1,disapointing fake,this is NOT a duplicate of the original record some cuts sound like they were recorded off a warped record!!-DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!
2,The doors are waiting for the sun,"My name Is Michael from Denmark, and the only reason why I bought this record, was because of ""Not To Touch The Earth"", whitch I think is the best song on the album, and because It sounded great when Val Kilmer sang it in the documentary-movie about The Doors. ""Five To One"" is a good headbanging rocksong, and ""Summer's Almost Gone""is a real romantic,but the rest could have been much better, like:""Break On Through and Light My Fire"", but If you are a real addict to The Doors, buy the album, although L.A.Woman and Strange Days are better, both the music and lyrics!!! They're just breaking through(streight to the other side)!!!!!."
2,this cd is a triznip,"my whole thing is... this cd is titled ""waiting for the sun"" right?.. and most of us are familiar with the song ""waiting for the sun"" right?.. but where the bejeenitch is the song on this cd. it lists all songs, except the title track... oh m.f. well"
3,Bogus Doors,"This is yet another bogus Doors CD, their unfocused period in between their 2 definitive 200 albums ever made, the debut and L.A. Woman. While not as bubble gum oriented as the forghettable album with Touch Me on it which grew on me, it just doesn't have enough classic tracks on it to make it more than a three star, or quality album. This is their weird stuff. All ya'all are going before the 60s hippie movement in Christianity. The hippie movement personiofied in music by The Doors electrified Christianity, as they were no longer ethnic stereotypes and could do whatever they want. I love it."
1,wretched is right,"de salvo is being generous. if not for the rabid doors cult and media hype, most of the work of this band would have been dismissed long ago. this album in particular illustrates clearly why jim morrison made on looks and cheap p.r.--farcical concepts, lame song structures, lazy playing, and 'poetry' that sounds like the disjointed ramblings of a drunken crack head."
4,One Of the best,This is One of the best doors albums made. My favorite song on this album is Not To Touch The Earth. It's a great tune adn the words are amazing to me.
3,"OK, but....","music is superb, sound OK, but ...1) missing bass lines on Unknown Soldier,2) Spanish Caravan lost its power, it sounds very courtly now..BTW - listen to execution in the middle of Unknown Soldier - it is quite stupid remixed (execution squad stands right, shots sound from left e.g.!!)"
3,Sun burn,"WAITING FOR THE SUN might be evidence that Jim Morrison was either a tapped-out lyric writer (""Not To Touch The Earth"" and ""Summer's Almost Gone"") or just totally stoned out of his mind (""The Celebration Of The Lizard"" poetry). But then, we see flashes of the sort of brilliance that permeated the first two DOORS albums, tracks like ""The Unknown Soldier"" and ""Five To One"" stand up against any that this band ever recorded.Musically, WAITING FOR THE SUN often sounds tremendously dated-- perhaps it was outmoded even in 1968. Fuzz guitar and calliope-like organ are everywhere-- there's waltzes (""Wintertime Love"") and schmaltzes (""Love Street"") and all sorts of filler. A pattern of inconsistency established here followed the group right through toL.A. WOMAN. The DOORS were a band that the ""Best Of"" compilation was ideal for. LikeTHE SOFT PARADEandMORRISON HOTEL, WAITING FOR THE SUN is only for their most devoted fans and perhaps '60s rock completists."
2,Remix Rouses Suspicion,"Despite the fact that this is a great album, I was highly disappointed to learn that I'd received a new re-mixed version. I'll take the original mix any day. What's with the double-tracked Morrison vocal on ""Love Street""? Ugghhh... If you're not so picky you'll probably enjoy it and the many bonus tracks included."
5,Creativity at Its Finest,"The depth and insight of this music on these tracks are unprecedented. Robby Krieger's distinct sound that he has established as his own on the guitar in these songs, is like no others. When he plays his rhytmn/lead parts you can tell he is one of the greats. No wonder that in 1993 ""The Doors"" were inducted into the ""Rock N Roll Hall of Fame""!!His phrasing and finesse'that he releases here is from the soul and heart. For him to continually come up with something new and fresh is nothing short of genius! And for the band as a whole to create this masterpiece that is still flying off the shelves at your local record stores after more than 30 years speaks loud and clear to the critics of the past and present."
3,Disappointed Chuck Loeb fan,"I know that I'm a dummy and that the fact that the album title included the word ""Collection"" should have given me a clue, however, until I bought and opened the CD, I had no idea that this was a collection of previously released songs, culled from Chuck's older albums.It would be great if albums like this could make it clear (on the cover stickers)that some / most / all of these songs were from other albums, so prospective purchasers could check whether they had some / most / all of these tracks already.Had I know this was a previously released song compilation, I could have burned my own ""Love Song Collection"" from the albums I already owned."
1,It's like spraying teflon on a tin can,"Really thin and bent already upon arrival....good as a temporary, disposible frypan."
2,cheap pans,"Such mixed reviews on these pans! I had to order these twice because as another reviewer stated..lousey packaging. They arrived damaged. While I have not noticed the nonstick coming off, I do have to agree that these are not a good 5 year pan. They are poorly balanced, that meaning the handle is heavier than the pan and it will not sit flat on the burner, everything you cook slides toward the handle. I'll continue to use these until I find a replacement....then out they go!"
2,Low grade but functional,"We were not pleased with the set of pans from Farberware. We burned a previous 10"" pan and wanted to replace it. The quality was markedly lower and the pan diameter was actually less than 10 inches and the height of the pan is nearly 1/2 inch lower allowing spills more easily. You can find better pans at similar prices."
1,Les then thrilled with this bargain,The largest pan in this set is defective. The botton of the pan is bowed so it does not work at all with our flat top stove. The smaller two pans are just fine and I'm happy with the quality.
3,Works but is aggravating,"This VCR works just fine, but randomly, when I'm playing a movie, it will come out with a loud, annoying BUZZZZT! sound. I've rewound movies part way, and the BZZZT sound happens in different, random parts of the movie. I don't know how to stop it. I don't know how to predict it. And occasionally the machine just won't accept a video that I push into it. It spits it right back and refuses to play it.I won't get an RCA next time."
4,"I like this VCR, but...","...it's noisier than the than the one it replaced. The automatic features were just annoying, so I turned them off. It does everything I expect a VCR to do, the quality of the playback is very good.This is the third RCA VCR I've owned and if I get as much use from number three, I'll be happy."
4,My cat loves this toy,"This is my cat's favorite toy. She goes crazy for it, maybe a little too crazy.The only reason I give this 4 stars and not 5 is because the feathers have a tendancy to break easily. The end of the feather can snap and it might still fly right, but after enough breaks, it doesn't flutter in the air and then your cat may lose interest."
5,One of the best cookbooks I own,"This book is really great. I've used a number of its recipes and processes and have not been disappointed. Having lived for some time in Japan, cooking from this book has brought back memories. It also helps decipher all those 'strange and abominable' products in the local Japanese market. Rather than settling for instant noodles, I can now brew up an excellent broth and cook noodles just like the yakuza flunkies outside the subway stations. Her explanation of sushi rice has also been very helpful.For a beginner (particularly a Westerner intimidated by salt-embalmed fish), I think this book is an absolute must-have. Never in my life would I have imagined that I would have a use for dried sardines, and was pleasantly surprised to find what a flavorful broth they can be coaxed into producing with Ms. Booth's patient guidance."
5,Why Some Positive Thinkers Get Postive Results,"A must have for any library. Not only is it an entertaining read, but it is full of good advise and stories to ponder upon."
2,1 out of 3,"I bought three pairs of jeans in two separate orders and only one pair was right. The other two were smaller than advertised, even though the tags displayed the dimensions I ordered. I measured the waistline myself and found that one pair was just under 2 inches smaller than I ordered and the other was four inches smaller. One of them came with several belt loops torn away from the waistline. The first order had paid for my return shipping and a full refund because they were torn, but the second return was at my expense and a restocking fee is to be applied since they were not damaged.The pair that I kept were perfect in every way, so no complaints there."
3,Sun And Steel,"This is the better of the two post-Ingle releases. Good artwork, too. ""Scorching Beauty"" is my choice for best cut on this CD."
1,worst 70's rock album ever,"I can't believe anyone likes this album. I didn't even know about it until a couple days ago and have just finished listening to it. Now let me clarify, I am a big fan of the original lineup and have owned Scorching Beauty for many years. I thought that album while being Iron Butterfly in name only, was a great albeit different album. It had lots of catchy songs and rocked out, and even had good ballads. This is not the follow-up I expected. It's way too commercial sounding and the slick production is a big hinderence. I did like the song Scorching Beauty but obviously that was left over from the sessions for the previous album of the same name. A big waste of time, don't bother. I bet the people who liked this album also liked the Jefferson Airplane reunion album from 89, cause that was also made for ex-hippies who no longer trip."
5,Trent Reznor releases his genius once again.,This album is incredible. I feel terrible that I didn't expect it to be as amazing as it is. He definitely returns to his roots here and digs deep into his dark side which he didn't do as consistently on With Teeth. But this album shows him at his full potential and it's mesmerizing. He draws you in to witness what he sees and feels. Trent Reznor is a genius and has displayed that once again for us. I can't stop listening to this cd. And as usual so many of the lyrics hit home and are applicable to most of the human emotions that exist. He is an inspiration to anyone with an interest in music and writing. He creates both brilliantly.
5,This is what I've been waiting for,"The title pretty much sums it up, but more specifically...Since The Downward Spiral, this is the type of CD I've been waiting for from Trent. I love all of his music he has been making since The Downward Spiral like you wouldn't believe. The Fragile, a master piece, W_T has some excellent songs on it, but this is the CD I've been waiting for for a long time, and Trent came through. Heck, he always comes through, but this CD is amazing on a whole new level. Take time to listen to this YZ several times over, each time it gets better. I find great CDs will do that. Trent explores a whole new realm of music style that is just mind blowing, and artistic beyond words. Noise has never sounded so good. Songs like God Given, Capital G, Good Soldier, and Me I'm not are amazing. Sum Zero is a very low key (relative to the rest of the CD), yet powerful song almost anyone will like. W_T was a good CD (though has some amazing songs on it), but YZ is a great CD. Buy it!"
2,Bad NIN,"Having all of his previous studio releases, and having seen him live in concert twice, this one feels like the leftover stuff that didn't make it on With Teeth, its just not worthy of his previous work. It not intriguing or moving, its just annoying."
3,"Please remix this album, Trent","I love NIN, and listen to Downward Spiral and With Teeth often. This new release is a bit murky, but something's definitely trying to break free of all that crushing gravity. Survivalism and Meet Your Master are the strongest tracks here, as is. The Great Destroyer hits a groove before descending into sonic Playstation battle effects. As Trent suggests, this will evolve with repeated listenings...but my best hope is that he'll continue to forge new relationships with producers (heard him on some NY rapper's release recently!?). Zero Sum, God Given (and the rest?) could stand to be be further transformed by the right remixer into something more powerful..."
2,Not Memorable,"I was not impressed at all by this album. The songs sounded too much the same. No stand out songs that I would really care to hear again. Im not a HUGE fan, but if I was I could still be objective. The songs are heavy on sound effects, beeps, scratches, etc.. and way too lite on creativity and melody. Most people like NIN because they are able to make industrial music more than just industrial music. They give it dynamics that others can't. They have always taken it to the next level. To me, this album sounds like it could have been made by anybody. Nothing was memorable."
2,big let down,"First of all, I'm a huge fan of trent, I think he's a huge talent, but this album simply blows. All the songs sound the same, lyrics are pretty dumb and lifeless, and it overall sounds rushed and sloppy. the fact that he's writing about politics makes me cringe.listening to this makes me realize why it takes trent 4 years to make an album. if it takes 4 years to make another great album then do it. With Teeth was wonderful, what the hell was this?skip this one and listen to The Downward Spiral, Pretty Hate Machine, The Fragile, With Teeth, or any other NIN album other than this stinker."
5,Trent Reznor is so cool,"First off, thanks for not making me wait years for a new NIN album. This concept album is d*mn good, too. And the fact that the CD changes color when you play it and reveals a secret message? Just icing on the cake. Trent Reznor is a marketing genius."
5,Reznor hits the nail on the head,"I really enjoy NIN older music but YZ is their best yet. Reznor's music is original and maturing. There's not to many artist's making political statements these day's it's very refreshing to listening YZ, the concept of what is happening to our world with these lunatic psychopaths who have taken control needs to be said! RIGHT ON REZNOR!!!I was fortunate to catch a NIN show on the YZ tour all I can say KICKED A**!"
4,interesting cd...,check out the cd once it comes out of your cd player.....neat lil trick trent has going on...also check out the phone # of the back of the cd on that piece of paper...oh yeah andthere is a website listed with the lyrics...but that one is pretty obvious...great destroyer is pretty cool with your sub turned up...
5,One Of The Best,"Simply the only music worth listening to. This is the best album of 2007, and some of TR's best work to date. Nothing else out there even comes close to sounding like this."
4,I prefer the old NIN,"I haven't bought an NIN CD in a long time. With all the hype surrounding ""Year Zero,"" I thought I'd give them another try. Didn't get much out of it. I'll stick to the Perfect Drug CD next time I'm in the mood for NIN."
2,shame on TRENT.,"trent is NOT what he used to be.it's a new sound. a different sound. sounds like some dude who just got garageband and found the distort button.... and i hate to say that about trent because ""the fragile"" and ""downward spiral"" sit at the #1 and #2 spots on my all time list. he's a music genius, but YZ certainly is not.i wonder why it's so popular, and that could be attributed to his clever marketing campaign... maybe the music is a little more poppy or mainstream... maybe the slough of super fans will go out and buy it, like it, talk it up regardless of it's music prestige simply because its a nails album and it must be liked.i personally thought this album sucked and was by far his worst... 3 decent tracks at best."
2,"I've tried to like this album, but ...","NIN has been a staple in my music library since the release of ""Pretty Hate Machine"". His music, beats and lyrics are phenomenal, usually.I have found 3 songs that I can stand to listen to in this album. Most tracks appear to be poorly mixed or have very annoying samples played over them.""Year Zero"" seems more like a first album than an 8th album. His music definitely took a step backwards in this case."
5,Really shows how lacking With Teeth was....,"I loved Beside You In Time, as some of the songs off With Teeth are alot better when played live...but I have to say this album is a true return to form for Trent Reznor....deftly combines everything he has touched upon in the past (Hard industrial guitars a la Broken, the darkness of the downward spiral, and the soundscapes of the Fragile) and created a true masterpiece. The CD art and thermal layering on the CD itself are worthy of a NIN release(unlike the simple design of With Teeth). The themes are engaging and interesting and startlingly relevant in the world we live in today. I am anxiously awaiting the North American tour!"
2,Disappointing,"I used to be pretty into Nine Inch Nails about 15 years ago. I've got to say though, that this album is pretty much a disaster for me. I don't want to listen. The only song worth repeated screening is Survivalism.I haven't decided yet if that's because I've grown out of the genre or because Trent Reznor is getting worse at making music. I am not a music fanatic but I know what I enjoy. Year Zero is not what I enjoy. It's too far from music and too close to pure cacophony."
5,Mind playin' tricks on me.,"I put this album in my computer to add it to my iTunes and I left the room. When it was done ripping, I came back and took it out and noticed the disc was white. I thought I was losing my mind. I even asked someone who saw me open it ""the disc was black, right?"" Then I noticed it was a heat sensitive disc. Go me.Anyway, this album is really amazing. It seems to be a step up from his 2005 release, ""With Teeth."" As everyone else will say, this album touches back on NIN roots and sounds less organic. So I'll save you the monologue...Just go buy it."
3,Paranoia Masterpiece,"Probably NIN's best album since the Downward Spiral. Works great as a concept album and is a must have for paranoids who believe the government is plotting against them. Great tracks, far superior to With Teeth (which didn't have any) A return to form for Reznor, doesn't pull punches and has some great sounds and even better lyrics. Only complaint is a throw away track that's just sound and not real music or lyrics, I hate when musicians do that crap. Highly recommended for 21st Century listening pleasure."
2,The song on the radio is IT,"The only good thing about this CD is the song they play on the radio. Too bad, really."
1,Lifeless NIN,This album just sucks. It is terrible. It has absolultey no life. Reznor used to be able to strike an emotion just through the music. Not on this album. He needs to get back to hating himself and not the world. And he needs his old band back. Charlie and Danny were the ones that made Nine Inch Nails - Nine Inch Nails. Stay away from this album. Stick with The Downward Sprial. Reznor's last good album.
2,What?,"I'm sorry but this album is no creative masterpiece. Compared to most of the crap that comes out these days it is OK at best. To put this album up there with Pretty Hate Machine, Broken, The Fragile and The Downward Spiral... HELL NO. With Teeth sucked especially the singles off of that album. This album IS better than With Teeth, but that is about all it has going for it. I guess if you were 8 years old in 1994 you might think that these albums are great, but the Nine Inch Nails glory days are over. It's almost as if he is afraid to make loud abrasive music again. If he put as much energy and thought into the music of this album as he did in the concept of it, it might be good."
1,Overpriced coaster of audio prozac,"Ive been a NineInchNails fan since i bought Pretty Hate Machine in 89. This is NOT a good album. at best, it's background music for when you are doing something else. there is nothing about it that will stick in your head after you turn it off other than how poor it really was. The whole album sounds like a collection of crappy b-sides that didn't make the last album. I wont try and convince myself to like it like some others seem to have done. that this could be rated higher than ""With teeth"" makes me think the rating system is useless. Save your money and if you are a fan save yourself the dissapointment you will feel after having heard it.Those of you giving it 4-5 stars need to really ask yourselves: would you rate it that high if it was put out by someone you don't like or are you just saying it's great because it says nin on the front?"
5,God have mercy on our dirty little hearts...,"Dark vision of future by the genius of Trent Reznor, reborn after the weak ""With teeth"" album. Filled with the memorable tunes accompanied with the sounds in the level of physical pain (visit a concert, you will understand). My personal favorite album of 2007. Highly recommended!"
4,This Wasn't the One for Me,"I can't say I hated this cd because it is a really good piece of work, but seeing as my favorite cd is The Fragile, I was probably bound to not like this cd as much as the other halos."
2,I've heard it before when it was better,"This cd takes the worst parts of The Fragile and the worst parts of Pretty Hate Machine and combines them to create a mediocre concept album. Now I'm no Nine Inch Nails basher, but this cd doesn't have much going for it. The concept is alright, but the music doesn't stand out or provide enough oomph to make the cd enjoyable. The Fragile was filled with tracks that had no lyrics and no real concept, but they were broken up with great tracks like We're In This Together Now and Starf***er. This cd takes that idea, with an entirely different concept, and doesn't deliver on anything memorable both musically or lyrically. NIN's last two albums, With Teeth and Year Zero, show Trent Reznor treading water. It seems as if he has become a parody of himself. This cd isn't horrible, but it is not even close to being as good as The Downward Spiral or The Fragile."
2,Mediocre by NIN standards,"At some point, every industrial band makes a concept album about a bleak vision of the future. So I expected something brilliant, or at least interesting from Trent Reznor. This is neither brilliant, nor interesting, nor even thought-provoking. If this is Trent's vision of the future, the future sounds like 1990. There are a few decent tracks on here, to be fair, but if you know and love NIN's earlier work, this is pretty tame stuff by comparison. I've listened to it several times now, and it's NOT getting more interesting with repeated plays. Worst of all, it really doesn't have even one standout track that sticks in your head afterwards."
4,Dystopian concept albums are getting old.....,"I'm sorry. I love NIN to death and I think the sound on this album represents Trent at his most innovative.But, c'mon: Did he honestly think he was bringing anything new to the table with the vision of the future that he's presented? Countless bands have built albums around their own bleak interpretation of the future, totalitarian government and all. It's been done. Big deal.This political grandstanding among some of music's bigger acts is becoming tiresome. Reminds me of Janine Garafolo's (sp?) puppet Doppleganger on ""Team America:""-""As celebrities, it's our job to read the newspapers and then repeat what we read in the newspapers as if it's our own opinions!""-Read Reznor's recent interview with Terrorizer magazine. It's as if he truly believes this album and others like it will effect some sort of far-reaching social change.Not likely. But keep holding out, fellas."
3,"New sounds ?? Please check out Autechre, Aphex twin or Squarepusher !","I've read many reviews and find it is rediculous to me that many people said that this album contains many new sounds. Please if you are nin fan but never heard anything from 'Autechre' (try 'Confield'album which release 6 years ago !!), 'Aphex twin' or even 'Squarepusher' (I'd recommend 'Go plastic' album 5 years ago) then you will know how old of the sound of year zero are. Believe me i love nin but i just don't understand why trent cannot go further than this ?! since he were an only extreme advance music creative during early 90's. You may also try 'Sigur ros' (try album ( )) if you want something really new,dark mood with bright future of music creative."
3,eh...no downward spiral,A couple catchy tracks but other than that this album was a bit of a disapointment. The color changing CD was cool though.
2,I usually LOVE NiN....,"I got the new cd and tried to introduce NIN to my girlfriend, but what came out was far worse than I could have imagined. There are a couple quality songs on the album, but ALL of them are ruined by ridiculously high-pitched beats or abrupt, annoying sound effects that really didn't need to be in the song at all. As hard as it was, I listened to the entire cd.Sure enough, I take the cd out and put in ""With Teeth"" and ""Downward Spiral"" and my girlfriend goes ""Oh yeah, now THIS is good!""I didn't even care if my gf liked it or not, I was just shocked that a NIN cd could make my ears bleed like that... I've been listening to their stuff (all of it) for 10+ years now, if you are unsure just download a song or two or borrow someone else's cd, listen for yourself before you pay for this album."
2,Did I miss something?,"I've listened to this quite a few times & it just isnt all that good. I dont understand all the 5 star ratings. The production value is fantastic as to be expected from Trent, except theres not much here that hasnt been done before & done better. This would make a great EP but as a full-length album its boring. How Trent sells so many records is beyond my comprehension. The concept for the album is awesome I just wish there was good music to back it up. I appreciate With Teeth alot more now(not that good an album but I was never bored)"
5,Restrained Tension,"Great tracks on this halo. I noticed that the tracks are shorter than usual and that they seem to quiet down towards the end of the album. The best way to describe this album is that there is tremendous energy that feels like its being restrained and ready to explode... but it never does. At first it feels like being cheated out of that energy release. Yet, the restraint itself draws you back to it. Subtle in a way, but it definitely has an awesome sound."
4,"Good album, some nice change ups.","Trent reznor is on the ball these last couple of years, releasing with teeth and now Year Zero, both solid works. It continues much of the same progression and style of music he has had recently, with some good change ups from a harder sound/rock driven music to a more toned down, lyrically driven music as well. I am starting to warm up to his newer material, but Still find myself going back to the classics, Pretty hate machine, Broken, and the downward spiral. Worth picking up, some solid material that really is a blend of all of his years work."

4,"not as relentless as some of his earlier work, but good","This album finds NIN more introspective and pointed...gone are the songs that seem to just lash out, even the anger is tempered. With Teeth fits my mode more, as the songs themselves are well constructed but don't always stick in my mind."
4,Now Trent is all of a sudden a Milleniumist? LoL,"Give me a break. This album is not much better than the last effort. Trent seems to have become one of those apacolyptic weirdos. I'de rather watch Kenneth Copeland or Jack Van Impee talk in their foolish toungues than Trent. I love old NIN, but this stuff is not that special at all. I think it's just an excuse to bash our country and president as a leader when our soldiers and president is doing the right thing. Trent states that imagin the future 15 years from now being worse than right now how our country is. Hey Trent, U can still make millions off records? U can have a million dollar palace? U can go to the bathroom without someone having to watch every move u make. Give me a break buddy. If anyone should complain, it should be me and your fanz for being poor, but I don't complain because I live in a free country. People like this really need to start focusing on the positive things in life or atleast get laid."
1,unlistenable,"First off let me say I love nine inch nails, the downward spiral, pretty hate machine, the fragile, and with teeth are all incredible albums....""year zero"" however, is one of the worst albums i've heard in the last decade. It seemed like the album just kept getting worse as it went along....I can honestly say i liked absolutely 0 songs on this album. And honestly, i don't understand how anyone could truly enjoy this garbage. It's beyond terrible.....words can't express exactly how bad i think this album is. It's really no surprise to this fan though....As far as i'm concerned Reznor has completely sold out....just look at the man now....what ever happened to the trent who wore surgical gloves on stage? Now he's like a bodybuilder and he shaved his head. Don't get me wrong, i'm glad he's happy now but he should really just retire because if this what the future of NIN holds i'm not too excited............."
3,Underwhelmed,"Nine Inch Nails is at its best when Mr. Reznor sticks to what he knows--his own internal life. This attempt at social and political commentary is ideologically unsophistocated, and, worse, musically unremarkable.That being said--the album isn't actively *bad*. It's exquisitely produced and engineered. Some of the songs are even pretty catchy (I liked Capital G and In This Twilight). But it doesn't have that raw and terrible beauty that turned me into a raving nin fan in the first place.What I love about Reznor's work is the noise, the energy, the exhileration and brutality that I associate with albums like The Downward Spiral, Broken, and, too a lesser extent, The Fragile. With Teeth doesn't have it. And neither does Year Zero. I'm extremely disoppointed."
2,"OK, but not the 9 inch nails I was looking for.","This album is just OK. I'm not sure what the goal was, but they did not bring their best to this album. I guess it was hard given that previous albums have just been so great, but this was a let down. No flash, and no feeling. Where's the apathy? It's not all bad, but set your expectation down a notch."
3,"Good, but sounds like B-sides....","""Year Zero"" is like NIN""s ""Piscies Iscariot"". Its good stuff, but it sounds like B-sides. The only tracks I really like are the final three-Another Version of the Truth, In This Twilight, and Zero Sum. Does not rank with other NIN albums, sorry."
5,Year Zero is 2007,"Year Zero is definitly the best work of NIN since The Downward Spiral. It is beautiful and very artistic, though it may be dark beauty. From the first track Hyperpower!, that pulls you in with a noisy drum instrumental, to the angst of Capital G, and the soft piano of Another Version of the Truth, this is worth your time and money. It has good beats and drum work by Josh Freese, and Saul Williams guest vocals on Survivalism, which reached #1 on Modern Rock Charts. If you liked The Downward Spiral and the hard to digest The Fragile, you will love this new installment of the NIN discography. It is something you never heard before."
3,Average. Nothing Amazing.,"or special, but not bad either. Good to have, but its not going to stick in your player. Not as good as With Teeth."
4,"Another solid, all around effort from Reznor.","Not alot of surprises on the new NIN albums, other than it's quick release, but the album as a whole is very solid. Reznor seems to be unusually careing about the subject matter on this ""concept?"" album. Sometimes the topic seems to get hidden by the constant wall of sound. This gripe seems to lessen the more times you listen to the album all the way through. A obvious must for all NIN diehards, but probably not the best starting point for brand new fans."
4,The Lottery Rose reviewed by Juicy Fruit,"The Lottery Rose is a book that is about things that happen in the real world.Georgie is a seven and a half year old boy who gets abused by his mom and her boyfriend.He can't tell on his mom's boyfriend,Steve because Georgie's mom told him that if he told on Steve then he would kill Georgie.Georgie wins a rosebush from a lottery.He takes care of it and loves it really much.This book is sad but it is good.Georgie has a bad life.His mom always tells him her life became worse the day he was born.I don't really like sad books but,this is a good book."
4,Lottery Rose,"i think this is a really good book, it keeps you wanting to continue reading it and not put the book down. But i think its really sad how he is pretty much on his own at age 7. How sad would it be to be abused by your mother and your moms bofriend. Its a sad book because this really does happen to kids out there in the world. and its sad to think how much pain and suffering they go through. Its sad that he has to have a rosebush be his best friend. But its good hes sent to a bording school to get away from his mother and mothers bofriend, to keep him safe. this book is sad, but its a well written book."
3,"Okay, umm depressing much?","I understand that this is a deep book that speaks to many, but it is so depressing in the first chapter that it didnt make me want to finish. If you have a strong heart or love heartwrenching stories feel free to read this book. However, if you have a weak heart or a low tollerance for the needy listen STAY AWAY. But that's just my opnion."
2,TOO SAD,"The Lottery Rose was too depressing. Georgie, Robin, and everything that happened in the book made me collapse in tears. I would not recommend it to anyone under age twenty."
4,Good things I like from The Lottery Rose by: Lamis,The Lottery RoseI only have read the beginning part of this book and I really understood the details and what the message was. I also understand the feelings of a seven year old boy who doesn't know how to read and he is always getting hit by a man that is not even a part of the family and lives in his home.If I was in that situation I would have the same feelings as Georgie in The Lottery Rose.If I was very poor and I had no toys to play with I would be very happy to win a rose bush even though Georgie didn't really win it. Read this book to find out what happen to the rose bush and Georgie.
1,pathetic story....,"It was the most depressing, disturbing book I have ever read. I am amazed that this is assigned to 12-13 yr. olds. Threw the book in the garbage when I was finished ... ending of story was truly pathetic.Many kids have lived this story. To have to relive it in English class is cold and uncaring. I truly hated this book. Have never read any of Irene Hunt's other efforts ... doubtful that I ever will."
2,Not as durable as expected,"I have an American Pit Bull Terrier and she is a fairly aggressive chewer. I had read the reviews on here saying how durable this toy was and ultimately it led to me ordering it. Unfortunately, within 10 minutes of getting the toy, my dog had removed the octopus's legs. After half an hour, she had chewed a large sized hole in the side of the toy and ripped it into tiny pieces. If your dog likes to chew, I wouldn't recommend this as it doesn't last very long."
3,Didn't remain intact for long...,We have a one year old Husky. He chewed the top of this toy off in about 10 minutes. I'm giving it 3 stars because he still likes to play with it and I can stuff small dog treats in the hole now.
2,Destroyed in less than 2 minutes :(,"I have a bulldog/border terrier mix who LOVES to rip apart her toys, so this sadly was not the chew toy for her. She went right for the ""neck"" on this toy and had chewed through the rubber in under 2 minutes, so it no longer squeaks. I wouldn't recommend this for a heavy chewer!"
2,not durable,"I purchased this toy before at a pet store, and it lasted forever (I eventually chose to throw it out because I could no longer clean off the grossness that accumulated on it). So I ordered a replacement, which came apart within two weeks of my Boston terriers playing with it / chewing on it (one of the Bostons is an old fellow and barely has any teeth left...). I wouldn't recommend ordering this toy."
1,Not as durable as described,"I originally purchased this item from a local pet store a few years ago, and it was extremely durable and my dog's favorite toy. However, when I bought a replacement on Amazon a couple of weeks ago, it didn't last more than a day before my golden retriever, a sporting dog with a gentle bite, separated part of the bottom of the toy. I ordered another replacement last week on Amazon. My dog had it for less than 20 minutes before the same exact thing happened: part of the bottom-side of the toy perforated. To the manufacturer: did you change the materials, the design or the manufacturing process? This item is much less durable than the version we got a couple of years ago. And the version you are selling now is unacceptable in terms of durability."
2,Unfortunately...,"Though this JW pet toy is fairing marginally better than the poor chicken (only the tentacles have been chewed off, which was expected, & the squeaker ripped out), it still is not worth the money that I paid for it. Years ago, another, identical looking but sadly far sturdier Octopus was a fantastic purchase that I tried to repeat for my chew-happy dog. It was not to be. Be advised that this is another toy that will fall victim if you've got a strong-jawed pet."
3,Fun but squeak died,"While my Corgi wasn't able to break the squeak, her visiting friend wiped it out in minutes. My Corgi nipped off the little tentacles and I found these all over the house. When the squeaker was working it was a fun toy for my Corgi, not so much squeakless."
2,Squeaky Octopus,This is the only squeaky toy my dog could not destroy in 2 minutes. I searched high and low for it and no pet store had it so I couldn't test it. I was so happy to get my shipment but to my dismay the squeak was so weak that all the fun is lost. I didn't send it back for a replacement even though I bought two of them. Blue runs around they yard with them but it it's not the same. I wasted my money and I will buy anything to keep my dogs happy. They don't make these like they did before or maybe I just got old stock.[...]
1,Cheap and useless,"This item wasn't overpriced, but it wasn't even worth the small amount it cost.Some of the numbering was already worn off and the rest wasn't legible."
5,The US Edition,"Divine Horsemen was the title used in England by Thames and Hudson. When printed in paperback form in the US, The Voodoo gods became the title.Rare collectors item, if you can get ahold of it.See review for Divine Horsemen elsewhere on this page ( the new released version)"

5,"Solid life cycle information, good crop info, buy it!","One of the basic books on serious gardener`sbookcases despite the outdated pesticide recommendations *which should not be followed*.Valuable because of the wide range of insect species described for many, many crops (everythingfrom corn to rubber plants, sage to daisies, roses to lawn grasses) and the life cycle informationincluded make this the best book I've found forfiguring out rational methods for pest control.Few drawings, but good descriptions of the species`mean that this book should probably be used in conjunction with a good field guide, likeBorror's _Insects_ volume (#19 in Peterson Field Guide Series).A publisher who would update and reissue this volume would be doing gardeners a big favor.Kay Lancaster"
3,Master vs. Pupils with a different twist,"To enjoy this book, you will need to accept the ridiculous concept of the Abelard Sanction. That is, the world's intelligence community got together (allies and enemies alike) and set up a system of safe houses where any operative could go and be protected from harm by any other operatives. Sure, it's hard to believe, but it is a key part of a very interesting story. It involves the familiar concept of teacher vs. student with some original twists thrown in. With each side trying to out-guess the other, you never know what is going to happen next.Character development and dialog are not the strong points of this book. You do get a little background on how the characters became who they are, but the book is really all about action and intrigue. And it delivers on that.... This is not great literature here, but it is a pretty good spy novel."
5,A Haunting Thriller,"I first read this book 20 years ago and I still think of parts of it today. I long ago lost or gave away my copy so I am rebuying at to do what I rarely do, re-read a novel.I am currently reading Morrell's Extreme Denial and have read most of his other works of art.I hope he is still writing because he has to be considered one of the best ever.Brotherhood of the Rose is my personal favorite."
5,good book,again i had the hard copy years ago but throoughly enjoyed re reading this. not too incredible with a fair plot and characters
3,I loved it!,"David Morrell is a skilled writer who keeps you spellbound and turning page after page from the very beginning. An awesome read, the only author who can come close to his style of capturing the reader is Sidney Sheldon."
3,Exciting...High Adventure...Tragic,"Will grab your attention from the beginning. It's an emotional rollercaster of suspense, action and betrayal. Very enjoyable! Makes me want to read more from David Morell. Lots of jaw-dropping twists and surprises!"
5,amazing,"I can't enough about how good this book is. I'm only fifteen and I think David Morrell is just a writer with an incredible talent that draws you into the book, making you love each and every character he gives you. I gave this book to my friend and she loves it too. Isn't it great how he appeals to such a broad range of people?The only word I can think of to describe this book is ~AMAZING~ nothing better."
2,Overwrought emotion stifles energetic plot,"The plot centers around two brothers raised as assassins by a top CIA director who offers himself as a foster father to gain their trust.The book focuses on the angst created when a father figure turns against his sons. Though the action was entertaining, the emotions were overwrought and rang false. It became tedious to hear the characters say again and again that their throats 'ached with love' as they planned their revenge. Artifacts of their love, like candy bars, seemed ridiculous in their repetition. I know that most other reviewers raved about this book but I'm struggling to understand why."
2,John Martyn doing Tom Jones doing John Martyn,"Sad. There is really no other way to describe this album. Martyn has exhumed some of his best work and added a Vegas sheen to it. Avoid this at all costs. Get SOLID AIR or BLESS THE WEATHER instead. And John, come back to us, please."
1,What did we do to deserve this.........,"This is possibly my first and last review. The Glaswegian bard is one of the true originals with a guitar technique all his own and a voice that would make another great scot say ""its singing Jim but not as we know it.."" Buy all you can get, a very good start is ""Sweet little mysteries. The Island Anthology"", BUT please do not buy this tortured abomination of a CD.This is not a best of, it is John Martyn meets Liberace.These are lounge lizard retakes of some of the maestro's best work.All I can imagine is that late one night he and a mate or two took a bet that he wouldn't have the guts to do it and this is the result."
2,Audio Sweetening v. John Martyn - Martyn Loses,"I've been a fan of John Martyn for twenty years. . .his beautiful evocative lyrics and haunting voice were like nothing else out there. Well, now he's re-recorded his best work and ruined it with awful violins, Motown backup vocals and treacly ""sweetening."" Picture what would happen if John Renbourne and Pentangle had collaborated with Liberace -- it's almost that bad. Order the Island Records double set if you want to remember John Martyn before he became a Las Vegas Lounge act. . ."
2,Battery Eater,"I thought at first maybe I had a defective version of the book but after reading other reviews, I see that our problem is normal. We had to replace the batteries after a weekend of play with the newly purchased book. The batteries were easily found at Wal-Mart, but they were very expensive. The second set of batteries only lasted a week. It looks like it's cheaper to order batteries from the company. My 18 month old LOVES the book and will sit and play with it for extended periods of time, however, the batteries just don't hold out long enough for the toy to be worth the money."
2,Battery issues,Like everyone else the batteries die right away I had bought a couple of batteries but they seem 2 last only a couple of days too bad cuz my autistic daughter loves the book but comes up 2 me takes my finger puts it on the battery compartment as if 2 say fix it mommy I would never spend the money the books are at now I paid like $20.00 for it
2,Doesn't last!,"Great content in the book and my son loved all the music and sounds the buttons made. However, after just a few days of use and change of batteries, the buttons no longer made noises and the songs no longer played. He loved it, so I ordered another book (first book was a gift) hoping we had just received a lemon. The replacement book started doing the same thing after just a week of use. My son tries to push the buttons but it just makes strange feedback type noises. Would not recommend wasting your money."
3,Warm,"I am not too crazy about this book. The stories were okay, the poetry well written, but it felt like an Erotique Noire : Black Erotica rip off. I understand this editor was involved in that particular book. Maybe he should hook up with those two again and write another book."
1,"I'm sorry, I hated it!","I have never read a book so boring in my life! I read Erotique Noir, and there were good poems here and there. I was hoping Dark Eros would have filled the gaps that were left by Erotique Noir, but the poems and writings just got more and more boring. There were VERY few writings I would have even considered to be even remotley called erotica. I am very dissapointed in this effort. Its seems who ever put it together has lost the passion we feel as a pepole."
4,Where is the real sequel?,"I wanted so much to love this book, especially since it was billed and packaged to be the sequel to Erotique Noire, the best book of African Diaspora erotica ever written. This one has its hot moments, but it fails to embrace the scope and depth of that first work. It is a thick book, as thick as Erotique Noire, but it only has about half the number of entries. I believe its size was an unfair marketing device. I thought I was getting another remarkable encyclopedic work. Its redeeming quality is that it selected very good writers. I am still looking for the real sequel to Erotique Noire. And I demand that it be a big book that covers all of the bases."
1,music industry scam,Why is it that we are force by the music industry to listen to artist who obviously have no vocal talent. Ashanti has said in several interviews that she was drop by other labels before being signed to Murder Inc? Obviously other records execs realize the mistake they would make by signing her. This collection is as bad as all of her other music? Collectables.Yeah collectable garbage. She is horrible!!!!!!!
2,please murder inc's dead,"irv needs a miracle to stay in the game he had a bunch of acts on the inc that never shined black chile, cadillac tah, vita, and charli baltimore never had their albums see the light of day but irv was always about ja and ashanti it became tragic later on 6 remixes and 4 original tunes buy if you are a ashasnti nut otherwise download it."
5,This is the hotness!,"Honey, I was so glad that Murder Inc got acquitted of those ridiculous money laundering charges. I know Miss Ashanti would NEVER team up with a label that does shady practices, and that's why I respect her. This album is BANGIN' with beats, and you need to get this, okay? I love you, Ashanti!"
2,U Better Go Back to 2002...,"Im in love with Ashanti's self-titled first album.Chapter II & Concrete Rose were very dissapointed. I really think she is a great performer and songwriter, but she better go back to 2002, her beginning. That was Hot!Girl if you moved to another record company and make real R&B...; I'll buy it!!I even don't like this artwork!!!! It reminds me J. to that Lo! Wack!"
5,Ashanti Did It Again!,"Why all the negative comments? I love Ashanti and she can't ever do wrong. Every time she comes out with an album, or featured on someone else's track she blows up. Lloyd's ""Southside"" flopped but Ashanti stood on top. She came up with Ja Rule, but now people are only talking about her. Just face it, you can't help but love her sexy, smooth, classy, hip style. I love this new album cause it's got some of her best hit singles but with a twist. I like what Irv Gotti did with ""Focus"" and ""Only U"". The ""Rock Wit U (Aww Baby)"" remix is tight too. I never get sick of the original and loved it since it came out on ""Chapter II"". The four new tracks are cool too. My favorite has gotta be ""Still On It"" cause it's got Paul Wall & Method Man on it. This song is soooo bad and the beat is bumpin'!! Any Ashanti fan is lost without the ""Collectables."" I love her!!!"
3,Just average,"I highly respect Ashanti's decision to just put this album out for the holidays and not really pursue it as a major album. Why do I say this? Because real Ashanti fans will be disappointed. I like all 3 of her albums and this one pretty much falls flat. Mostly all the remixes seem thrown together, which they are not really worth listening to. The 4 new tracks are nothing superb either. ""Still Down"" and ""Breakup 2 Makeup"" are the only two decent remixes on this CD. She'll make it up with her next studio album later this year hopefully."
1,These 'Collectables' Aren't Worth A Dime,"Hmmmmm. Let's see. This so-called greatest hits CD just came out last month and now there are 104 used copies available for $2.50. For $2.50 I could buy a loaf of Value Time bread, 2 bags of onion rings, a Kit Kat, a can of Cherokee Red, and some Gummi Savers. I'm sure that the people who bought 'Collectables' sure felt salty after they listened it. I told y'all before: Ashanti has no talent what so ever. When you are folks going to realize that? But it's too late now. Ashanti has your money and now she's having her eyebrows and sideburns waxed."
1,When Is She Gonna Learn How To Sing?,"Ashanti can not sing and we didnt need a ""remix"" album to remind us."
3,A very Strange Ashanti Collection,"Ashanti's ""Collectables"" is a an album that feature 4 new songs and 6 remixes. It is kind of a hit and miss situation. While most of the songs are great, some are not.Rain On Me Remix - This is pretty much Jay-z's ""Can I live"" Part 3 (he already did a part 2). Irv Gotti Rehashes the same Isaac Hayes sample He used on the original and Jay-z's Track for a 3rd time and turns it into a rap remix to Rain on me lyrically based on Jay-z's classic Track. While the added raps are great, there's not enough of Ashanti on the track.Only U remix - The raps Ruined this remix.Rock Wit U (Awww Baby) remix - This uses the sheet music to the Michael Jackson classic ""rock with you"" (it's too far off to be an actual sample) and replaces the hook with an interpolation of MJ's hook. While the re-done beat is great, Mixing MJ's lyrics with hers didn't really work. She should have done a full MJ remake.This album is really only half there"
2,disappointment,this album is a huge disappointment due to the fact that they use these artists on murder inc that will never have the ability to release an album. still on it is the only song worth listening to on this album. some of the remixes aren't even the originals so they sound horrible.this album is short and sucks. it doesn't look like any thinking was put into this album at all.very sad to see what murder inc has become.
2,Really?,"Way too much for one can cover! The only reason we ordered this one was that it looked like there was more than one lid, didn't read close enough, won't be getting this again. They seemed to work just fine but $6 for one plastic lid, please!"
2,Not great!,"Seems expensive for just one cover and it fits so tightly on the small cans of pet food, I need a screwdriver to pry it off."
5,Tops for every can!,These are the best canned cat food tops I've ever owned... They are sturdy and actually fit on pretty much all size cans. Very useful.
2,where's the lids?,"When I first looked at the picture, it was just one item, face up so it appeared to be multiple lids. I was very disappointed when I discovered it was only one. The price was a little out of range for only one lid."
3,Picture is deceiving,"Usually I read things carefully... but I thought two lids came with the purchase, but only one does. Definitely too pricey for one lid."
1,Picture misrepresents what you get,I thought I'd be getting two lids but only received one. They work fine for various size of cans but product is overpriced for just one of them.
5,Kitty-Kap can covers,At first I had a hard time removing these lids from small cans such as Fancy Feast. The solution is to just add hot water to a bowl and set the can in the bowl. This takes the chill off the cat food and also makes the lid easier to remove. (The cats don't like cold food and they don't like the microwave method!!)
3,Buyer be careful with quantity....,"The lid is good, it works very nicely on two different can sizes. BUT, I thought I was purchasing two lids. The photograph shows two lids, but only one arrives. Read the fine print - there is only one in the description. $5.99 for a cat food lid!"
1,"Caps....It means Cap, just one","When I received my Kitty Caps, I wondered where the 2nd one was. They are extremely stiff and hard to take off the cans. I almost threw half a can away with the cap stuck on it out of frustration. And $5.60 is way too much for 1. The picture shows 2 and the description is plural, so make sure and read the fine print. What a rip-off."
2,defect,"Unfortunately, I was not satisfied with this product because it had defect.It didn't have invoce and was not packed well."
1,Problems with CDR Finalizing and Repair Redux,"Absolutely agree with the comments regarding the finalizing of CD's. I have made a magnificent series of coasters with this machine. My advice is to stay away from this unit, but if you do buy, be sure of the store's return policies!Mine's going back to Circuit City today. (I wonder if they will give me a refund for the burned, but unfinalized CD that is in the tray and will not eject?)Happy Trails!"
1,Junk,"I have experienced nothing but frustration and disappointment with this equipment. It has been a problem from day one and is not very intutitive to use, either. I will be packing it up and returning it for repair this week after only having it for 5 months, plus I have used it very little. It now will not open the CDR tray no matter what I do. When playing it in shuffle mode with 3 CDs in tray, it stops after about 15 minutes of music and I have to unplug it to get it to reset and do anything. When inserting a cd in tray to play it will not read the cd until I press play a couple of times and reopen and close the tray a couple of times. Previously, I had a Sony 5 tray cd changer for 12 years and never had one problem! Too much technology for a cd player recorder?"
4,Works great! For now anyway...,"This review is probably moot, since Philips seems to be phasing out their cd recorders, but here goes. I purchased one of these from the ""Scratch and Dent"" section of my local Circuitous City, and I experienced the exact problem that others had, were the unit locks up during recording (extremely irritating!). So, I returned this unit and went to Best Buy and bought another CDR800 and this one seems to be ok. I haven't experienced the same problem and I've had it for nearly a year.I need this unit because I still have a ton of vinyl and I wanted to commit some of my older LP's to cd. In this capacity it has worked wonderfully! The feature I really like best is the Track Increment button on the remote that allows you to break up the songs on an LP into individual tracks (I looked at a bunch of recorders and this one is the only one that I found that on). The 3 tray cd makes compilations easy to put together.I hope this one lasts a while!"
4,Beautiful Melody,"The sounds of these tracks are light and airy...just like a Sunny day in May! I really enjoy listening to this CD. I think Jody Watley is at her best here!""Music has a poetry of its own, and that poetry is called melody.""-Times, 17 Mar 85Joshua Logan"
2,James Gang Thirds,This albumn is the reason James Gang moved on and didn't make a fourth albumn. None of the music on this albumn is worth a real compliment. Joe plays some pretty good licks and then moves on with his carreer.
3,the james gang thirds,I like the james gang even with out Joe Walsh but the onley songs I like are the ones Joe sings
2,A disappointment,"The last recording with Joe Walsh and you can tell that Joe's heart was just not in it anymore. Thirds sounds as if everybody involved was just tired and confused, trying to find a new musical direction (knowing that Joe was soon departing). Nevertheless, there are two classic tunes on this album Walk Away and Midnight Man that are what I call the swan songs of what was once a great power trio. However, only two good songs on an album cannot carry the rest of the mediocre to bad tunes presented here. Unfortunately, the James Gang just went down hill from here and the rest of their recordings are simply a waist of money and time."
2,I GIVE THIRDS 2,"I bought this cd for one song, ""Walk Away"" which was one of their best known songs. I was hoping since that particular song was so good that maybe the album would harbor a few more gems. There wasn't. The rest of the album is like an anti-climax. I would suggest a greatest hits instead. If you see this cd just turn your pretty head and walk away."
5,JAMES GANG IN THIRDS,"ONE OF JG'S BEST ALBUMS, EVERY TRACK IS GREAT, ESPECIALLY WITH THE AWESOME SHM AUDIO FORMAT. MUST HAVE FOR ANY CD COLLECTION, BUT DON'T PAY THESE RIDICULOUS OVER-INFLATED RIP OFF PRICES, I BOUGHT MINE FROM THE MUSIC SPECIALIST ON E BAY, SAVE YOURSELF A TON OF CASH.CHEERS!"
3,Okay...if you want to keep buying it,"VCR's are definately skittish, especially this one. We bought it previously a year ago..and then it konked out on us...then we purchased it from Amazon..because it works with our TV since it is an RCA. I don't know why we bought it again..I am waiting for it to die like the first one did! DVD players are the better thing to purchase, they don't eat the VHS! (...)"
5,Hilarious!,"Smart, sassy, and full of surprises, the Thomas Guide kept me laughing from cover to cover."
5,Contracting made easy...,"Quick summary: If you intend on getting into Federal contracting, this is a very simple starter book. Lots of useful information and I've found quite helpful. Highly recommend this as a ""must read"" for all newbies in the business - you won't be disappointed. If you're experienced, don't bother getting this book - it's too basic and serves as an Intro 101 course summary."
5,Outstanding basic resource,"This is a concise and informative review of the basics of federal contracts, types, process, and terms. Excellent for the novice."
5,Wonderful!,"No need to ramble, this is a wonderful book!. If you enjoy Historical Romances, Adventure, Dashing Pirates, Seduction, and Happy endings, then this book is for you!"
4,John was really the Wolf King!,"This album got very little promotion when it came out. There was one song ""Mississippi"" that was played now and then. I loved it from the moment I heard it and bought the album on the strength of that and the fact that I like the Mamas and the Papas. There are many other good songs on the record which I played over and over again, I enjoyed it so much. ""Topanga Canyon"" is a particularly sweet and wistfull cry for help. Too bad John didn't record much more after this. He does have a credit on the Beach Boys hit Kokomo though."
2,Forget about home taping - over production is killing music,"Very overproduced and slick. The JJ Barnes stuff sounds nothing like his earlier Motown stuff which had a lot of feeling and warm, soulful production. These songs have a very early 70s sound and vibe for the most part even though they're from the late 60s. I'd suggest listening to samples before you buy"
1,What a shame,NASCAR FANS SAVE YOUR MONEY! This as well as others i've bought from nascar super store are almost un-watchable. It's almost like some kid with a 8mm camera filmed these races. These are not what was televised. Had any TV station aired these NASCAR would never be where it is today. The cars are white and black most of the time they are on screen. They are just silhouettes from the sun glare. I have been watching NASCAR since 1984 and I know personally this is not what was televised. Even some of the newer races look this bad. How could NASCAR get the money to grow as they did if fans couldn't see the fancy color schemes or even the number on the cars. And the sound is also equally as bad. I can't suggest strongly enough how much of a waste these tapes are.
4,Good but what happened to the sound?,"It's great that these old races are becoming available for the die-hard NASCAR fan. Great footage and video quality but something was definitely wrong with the sound the whole way through. The broadcast sound was distorted and Chris Economaki sounded like he was on a telephone. I know of, and have seen better audio feeds so I'm not sure why the sound is off on this one. I would have given this a five star if the audio was decent."
5,The Corpse at the Haworth Tandoori: an Unusual Mystery,"I enjoyed this Brit. mystery -- lots of interesting characterization & action. The setting is a small village, a cozy in a way -- & has little to do with Tandoori. There was a surprise at tne end. I've read several novels by Barnard, and they are not all cut from the same cloth."
5,THE BEST COLLECTION OF UTA I HAVE YET TO FIND,"I have been a fan of Japanese poetry for years, and have sought a collection of uta (song or lyrical poem) at an affordable price. The relatively extinct form, chooka, is in my opinion, well represented in this compilation. My favorate form of uta/waka, the tanka, is extreamly well represented.The hokku/haiku sections are not as definitive, but are also great. A chapter is included with senryu.The only items missing is originol Japanese orthography, however the roomaji that is included is (to a lesser extent) extreamly usefull.In my opinion this book is well worth considering."
5,A secret treasure,"I purchased my first M&M album (yup, vinyl) years ago out of a discount bin just because it looked interesting. This is music which defies labels and generalizations. The lyrics are whimsical and complex (""cynosures hiding in the air""). This isn't top-40 fluff, it's engaging and fun and challenging, all at the same time. Take a chance and try it."
4,Great Canadian New Wave,"A great new band that I just recently ran into, which I'm pretty happy about. This is a poppy new wave group that alternates between rock leanings, funk, Eno-influenced production, and dance. All of this coated over with a great sense of melody and songwriting. The first 10 of the 18 wonderful tracks, which pull tracks from their first 4 albums, are by far the best, taking four tracks from their best album in my opinion ""Danseparc"". Fans of new wave should take notice of this group, this is an interesting musical footnote on the genre and should please anyone interested in it. ..."
4,Better of many older submarine thrillers,"I was really impressed by this film and I must congratulate Hollywood for presenting the Soviet war machine in such a realistic way. The direction was fine, the actors well chosen, the script very good and Harrison Ford's acting top quality. I think this film was superior to older ones like ""The Hunt for Red October"" or ""Crimson Tide"" whose story was rather flat and predictable. The key advantage of the film is the intense psychological charging of the crew's attempts to cool the damaged reactor and the marvellous portrait of traditional Russian self-sacrifice."
4,True Story of Conviction,"While the Widowmaker is slow going at times, we watched it twice to get everything going on. It is a story of personalsacrifice during a tension filled era. Excellent acting."
4,Good movie,"Good movie. It's not ht eusual run of the mill submarine movie: depth charges, dodging enemy underwater missiles, etc.It's a deep drama, of course with some holes in the screenplay, but who cares? It's intention is noble. STOP THE WAR!"
1,Realistic Garbage.,"It graphically shows us (in all ugly and shocking details) how people are dying for nothing. The crew could abandon this ""can"" to begin with and all be saved, but stupid captain wanted them to be heroes instead. The captain preferred explicitly to send 6 of his comrades to terrible death for so called honor of the Socialist motherland, instead of saving all their lives by simply abandoning the ship. This captain (whom H. Ford played) is a brain washed communist criminal, not a hero, not a wise leader.Technically, this movie was very well done, but its setback in moral is severe. This movie took 100 million dollars to produce, and it brought back only 39 million. No wonder, it became a financial failure as well."
2,INDIANA WITH A RUSSIAN ACCENT,"K-19 THE WIDOWMAKER is certainly earnest in its attempts to show the loyalties and courage of a motley crew of Russian submariners, but director Kathryn Bigelow (Near Dark)shows no imagination in her limp and flaccid handling of this adventure tale. Since it's obvious the characters are Russian, why didn't she just let them speak in English instead of having reputable actors embarrass themselves with horrible accents. Peter Saarsgard as the noble Nuclear Reactor dude is the only performer who brings life to his role. Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson are abysmally ineffective, and by the time the movie reaches its overly sentimental ending, I was glad my investment of time in this klunker was over."
2,I like military suspence movies but,"This movie was painful to watch, most of the actore in the movie have the cheesest fake russian accents I've ever heard. Harison Ford fades from cheesey fake Russian accent to cheesey fake Irish accent to his normal accent and it .... Liam Neison fades from I don't know what to his normal accent. These are both actors I had respect for and that respect has been weekened because of watching this movie, they should be ashamed. However I gave this movie 2 stars because I really do like the story despite it being far fetched in some casees, but far fetched is Hollywoods specialty."
5,Tragedy at sea,"This has to be one of my all time favorite movies. For some reason though, it didn't stay in the theatres all that long. K-19 was the USSR's first nuclear powered submarine but it was doomed from the start. When they tried to christen the sub, the bottle didn't break; which is a bad omen. The most tragic part of the movie for me was when the reactor was very close to a meltdown. Not wanting another Cherynobyl, crewmembers volunteer to try and fix the reactor knowing that they will most likely die. Watching that part was difficult because you feel like you're there. This is a movie that everyone should see."
2,Relentless music and depressing,"Other reviewers have mostly covered it. I just wanted to add my vote to the ""too depressing"" side of the reviewers."
3,Good because of Ford,"Harrison Ford is the calling card. I'm not sure how much was actual fact in the movie, but it was compelling as told."
3,K-19: The Widowmaker,"I only gave this movie 3 stars. It was an okay movie. In film, Harrison Ford plays a doctor who looses his wife played by Betty Buckley, and goes all over France trying to find her as he gets no help from local police."
2,Bland and uninteresting...,"This film has its moments, but they are few and far between. I've rarely seen a film that is this lifeless from beginning to end. I actually admire Hollywood for making a picture based on the true story of a Russian submarine because, after all, heroism knows no single nationality. However, the film does stereotype Russians more than a little, and, worse, it never really hits its stride as a movie. It drags on and on, and by the time the end credits roll, there's really nothing to talk about. It's already forgotten."
1,Advertised Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1,Came Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1 and that is the only thing about this movie that is right. Would have given it zero or less stars if there was that option. Horrible movie. So disappointing. Having never seen it before I was expecting a great movie like Red October or Clear and Preasent or any one of a number of great movies like this sounded. I actually ended up giving it to the first person who wanted it. Waist of money. Shrug?
4,Professional and provocative.,"The word that first came to mind when this movie was over was that this film was very ""professional."" Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson both give solid performances, subtle but filled with suppressed tension. What makes this movie all the more provocative is that it is based on actual events that took place in 1961, certainly at the very peak of the Cold War. The huge cast of character actors also come across well with admirable performances. The fact that the Cold War is over makes for a dated feel to the story. Also, the movie is about 15-20 minutes longer than my attention could handle, the pace being so deliberate. There were moments when I recalled the greatest Submarine film ever made, ""Das Boot."" That should be praise enough for all involved in the making of this strong, compelling film."
3,"Entertaining, but in a tough category of films","""K-19"" is an entertaining movie, definately worth seeing for those interested in the cold war era. It does have a tough category in which to compete, as most submarine movies are based during wartime. But this does give viewers an idea of the dangers of military life during peacetime activities. It is generally well acted, and pacing is good once they get to out to sea.OK, now for something that really bugged me: the fake Russian accents. It hits you at first like ""I'm Harrison Ford playing a Russian"". Same for Liam. It also seems like they don't have the same amount of accent throughout the film.While more realistic than most movies, it's excitement value is not as great as, say, ""U-571"" (which is very unrealistic). Most similar to ""Crimson Tide"", this movie is clearly better."
1,One of the Worst Movies of All Time,"Harrison Ford was ridiculous trying to portray a Russian naval officer. Talk about miscasting. Movie just terrible with absurd, but hilarious dialogue."
4,Memorable For The Radiation Scenes,"This was a pretty solid supposed true story of a Russian submarine and its captains during the early 1960s. It's memorable, story-wise, for the radiation victims among the crew members. There are some really dramatic scenes involving that horrific event. Otherwise, it's a story of the sub's problems and the conflict between two captains.The story starts slowly so you have to stick with it as it gets better and better as it goes on and rewarding enough to make you glad you hung in there for the whole 137 minutes.Profanity is minor and the Russian accents are handled well by the lead actors, led by Harrison Ford, Liam Neeson and Peter Sarsgaard.It's not a great film, but it's good and interesting enough to recommend a rental, but not something I'd watch numerous times. Those radiation scenes would be a little too grim to watch numerous times."
4,ALMOST A UNDER WATER TITANIC,"K-19 IS A TRUE STORY OF RUSSIAN SUB (61)-THAT WAS CURSED @PORT WHEN THE CRISSEN BOTTLE DIDNOT BREAK.9 MEN DIE BEFORE LEAVING PORT,THEN ON A DRILL THE SUB BEGINS TOO LEAK RADIATION & OVER HEAT.DESPITE INJURIES AND RADITION,THE CAP-ACCEPTS ORDERS TOO SIT OFF THE COAST OF THE NE-U.S.A.WHILE CENTERED BETWEEN A NATO BASE AND A US-DESTROYER THE SUB ONCE AGAIN BEGINS TOO LEAK RADATION AND OVER HEAT.TOO AVIOD REPROCUTIONS AGAINST THE MOTHER LAND &SURRENDERING; THE SUB IS TAKEN UNDER TOO ATTEMPT REPAIRS.THE SACRIFICE OF THE CREW SAVES THE SUB & WITH ABOUTTHE ONLY LUCK THE SHIP HAS IT IS RESCUED BY ANOTHER RUSSAIN SUB.STAR WARS VETERNS FORD (CAP.VOSTRIKOV)& NEESON(CAP POLENIN) UNITE& BOTH DELIEVER A VERY GOOD PERFOMENCE.POLENEN SEEMS TO BE FOR THE CREW AND FAMILY ATTMOSPHER OF THE SUB. VOSTRIKOV-FOR THEMOST PART SEEMS TOO LEAN TOWARD ABITION AND SERVICE TOO MOTHER RUSSIA.I GIVE THIS MOVIE 3.5 STAR-ALTHOUGH GOOD DRAMA/SUSPENCE IT DOES START TOO FEEL LONG AFTER A 1.5HR."
3,K-19 Falling Short,K-19 had a great plot. Playing the plot was a set of equally great actors. My problem with the movie was how bored I became after an hour. I new exactly what was going to happen. The submaire footage was blane. A great war/submaire movie is The Hunt for Red October not K-19. This review is short and sweet because I have nothing to say about the movie.
4,Exciting Adventure Film,We watched the film this evening and found it easily held our attention all the way through. If you have any interest in naval adventures this one should satisfy. It was similar in my mind to Crimson Tide and Hunt for Red October; if you enjoyed those you will likely enjoy this one too.There are some extras as well which provide background on the production challenges that needed to be overcome to make the movie work. All told we found the movie and the special features provided an enjoyable evenings entertainment.
2,Das Boot is better,"As it stands, this movie is not bad.But, if you have ever watched Das Boot, you will probably agree that this movie is two things:1. Inferior2. The same thing, more or less.I mean, there are differences, mainly the sub here is nuclear (or nucular in Bush-speak), but there are several things that make this movie inferior:* it came after Das Boot, reflecting Hollywood's lack of creativity.* Harrison Ford's Russian accent [is bad].* The language is English, whereas my fav. Das Boot release is the original German with subtitles.* The main actors don't even look Russian for the most part.There were certain scenes where I noticed a very obvious duplication of Das Boot scenes. All in all I consider this a waste of money... I should have purchased a Das Boot DVD instead of renting this one."
3,Watchable,"I recommend to rent the movie, but not to buy it.My main problem with this movie is the script. What is the deal with the riot on the boat? Half of the movie they show us how bad is the 1st captain (Ford) and the second half he is the hero. But during all the 1st part he created the problems that cause the death of his crew members. The other weakness of the movie is that it failed to show how fanatically people believed in the Communism, that they were doing right things although through huge amount of dead bodies. Probably movie makers need more consultants in order to create a real good movie. I think in the real situation the riot on the boat is ended with the death of the captain or the riot crew, at least that what happened at the old times. All this riot plot is looks like a Hollywood fantasy."
4,Was a lot better than I though it would be,"A buddy of mine took me to see this and I though it was going to be some boring, paint-by-the-numbers, action film with Harrison Ford being the only saving grace. I was wrong. While not a complete historcial account, a good yarn none the less.The only problem was in the back of my mind I was waiting for a Wookie, an R2 astromech & C3 translator droid to pop up some where. Took a little while to get used to Ford not being the man that fixes the hyperdrive and all goes well."

The flagship of the Russian Navy though not quite ready for sea gets put underway with 2 Captians, yea that kinda don't go over so well. They have a reactor accident and it seperates the men from the boys. It is quite a gripping movie though. This is also one that needs to be bought not just rented."
4,A good cold war flick!,"A cold war movie can be just as exciting as a hot war movie, and K-19 proves it. Based on a true story, but still exciting, this movie is pretty historically accurate yet fun to watch. Turn the lights out and pop some popcorn, because you won't want to get out of your seat.The video and sound quality are excellent, although not quite reference quality. A more active soundtrack would have been nice, but it's still one of my better DVDs."
1,I threw it away,"Sorry to say, while the features of this travel clock seemed to be exactly what I wanted, it died after just a couple of weeks into an extended vacation. I suppose I could have sent it back, but rather than drag it around with me the rest of the trip, I simply threw it away. It stopped keeping time and made a horrible, constant clicking sound. Changing batteries didn't help either."
5,I carry this poem in my soul now...,"For me, not a chik flik, but a film about dysfunctional family relationships, skeletons in the closet, that, as life seems to always have it, must come out for all to get well. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, enjoyed the oppositional forces of the two sisters yet who love each other through and through, and are a great part of each other's soul. Enjoyed all the characters, kudos to the actors' portrayals, and the poem which when recited aloud, ohhh, you just want to hear it again. Bravo to all who participated in this film."
5,Nice Shoes,"I'm not a fan of Jennifer Weiner -I've read a couple of her novels and for the life of me I don't get the hype about such a mediocre writer--so I had very low expectations about In Her Shoes, despite the rave reviews. I'm happy to say I was wrong. This is one of those rare cases in which the movie is significantly better than the book. The characters seem real people, beautifully portrayed by Toni Collette, Cameron Diaz and Shirley McLaine--the three of them, at the top of their game."
3,Shoes are the only thing they have in common,"This movie is based on Jennifer Weiner's book of the same name. I enjoyed In Her Shoes, but since I read the book before I saw the movie I was dissapointed in the movie because of the noticable differences between the two.The story-line is the same Rose and Maggie are sisters that have nothing in common, but their shoe size, but after a parting of the ways they find that they have to mend fences when the grandmother that they thought was dead ends up very much alive and well and living in Florida. Very good acting by Toni Collet and Cameron Diaz."
3,Pretty good,If you read the book you'll want to see it thought it wasn't as good as the book. Cameron Diaz played her part well.
2,So Boring,"I found this movie to be dragged out and dull. It did the book very little justice, and cut out the best parts! I suggest reading the book instead."
2,2 Hour Waste of Time,"Cameron Diaz has no acting ability except to giggle, smile and make angry tense, facial expressions. You meet all the characters. They are all over acted (except Diaz, who just walks around looking stupid). They have all sorts of conflicts. They spill their guts in scenes that are suppose to be sad, but laced with humor. Everyone realizes they should treat each other better and learn to understand each other.The middle is the only part where a couple of interesting things happened - the beginning and ending where completely awful. And there was really no resolution to the title ""In Her Shoes"" other than Cameron Diaz's character taking and using (and ruining) various pairs of shoes (yawn). While this movie had a couple of moments that were interesting, at the end I just rolled my eyes and regretted wasting the 2 hours."
1,"Guys, do NOT see this...","OK, my GF negoiated me into seeing this film. If you can buy a dinner instead, DO SO!!! This movie is a strict chick flick - no comedy, no action, boring, slow, all about feelings and relationships between parent and siblings (and in laws). Plus it is depressing..."
5,Great present for sisters!,"I'm giving this to my sister for Christmas. It's one of my favorite ""chick-flic"" movies, and I've already seen it about 4 times. Love it!"
4,Superb Chic Flick,"The only reason why I didnt give this movie a five because it was kinda cheesy, however cheesy worked for me. The premise is FAMILY and what could be more improtant then that. Mix a little deception and down right romance and you have found a cute cuddly movie when you see In Her Shoes. I didnt read the book so I cant compare it. Guys will enjoy multiple booty shots of Cameron Diaz, as if we hadnt seen enough already (smile) while learning about loving a woman, and ladies you will understand the bonds of sisterhood. In Her Shoes is a great I am glad I saw that kind of a movie. Add it to your collection if you love chic flicks"
5,I'm reading the book next!,"Toni Collette (Muriel in 'Muriel's Wedding') chose another great role, or perhaps it chose her? She plays older sister Rose to a very messed up 'party girl' Cameron Diaz (Maggie). Maggie gives the line; 'You only hurt the ones you love' deeper jabs as she sabotages her own life and her sister's. But family bonds are never truly broken in this movie, and when Diaz discovers she has a grandmother (Maclaine), their past with a mentally ill mother becomes clearer to all of the women. Once they are able to sift through some childhood shadows, Maggie realizes that Rose has been her protector all her life. I found it interesting that the film brought out how the adolescent mind can 'tone down' tragic moments. This movie has soul, and though my husband dubbed it as a 'slight' chick flick, he enjoyed watching as well.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
4,Great movie,"First saw this at the movies, now have the dvd. The first 2 min's are hard (in fact almost walked out of the movies) but sit it out. You need to see where she was to really get where she ends up."
4,A true sleeper film!,"This film came out of no where and landed into our dvd players and on hbo. Thank God that it did because this movie is like that. There is nothing like sibling rivalries; Can't live with em', can't live without em'!"
3,More Hollywood pablum made digestable by three excellent actresses,"This story of two sisters--one the stereotypical workaholic and the other the cliched party girl--is touching in its way, though rather predictable and preachy. The characters talk way too blithely and easily about emotional things. A better film would have approached such conversations obliquely. Whenever characters start telling each other how they feel in terms too open and like they're out of a psychology textbook, I can't help but wince.That said, the acting is above par (Collette in particular does a marvelous job--as always--though she's been in many a better film than this one). MacLaine gives her usual off the cuff, yet multi-layered performance, and Diaz is well cast as the wild sister.If you want a movie that touches on important family and personal issues without delving into them too deeply or realistically (e.g. everyone ends up friends, happy, all their probelms resolved)then this is the film for you."
1,B.O.R.I.N.G.,Once again the Hollywood machine has produced and distributed an amateur flop of a movie that should have been thrown into the garbage. If movies are considered art than why can't hollywood take more time in making good art.Skip this movie.
4,In Her sister's Shoes,"I didn't like the movie as much as I thought I would like it but I liked it enough to give it four stars. It was cute, funny, sad, boring at time, but over all a decent film. I loved seeing both of the character grow throughout the movie. I would recommend it."
4,A Must See,This is a good one to see...the differences between sisters.I thought it had a great storyline...and had a great ending also. Not just for the girls to see I think a good man would enjoy this also. It's probably more an age thing to feel this movie has any meaning.A Must See
3,Ok to Watch Once,"Maggie (Cameron Diaz) is this lying, backstabbing, mooch sister. Diaz's sister (Rose) is a successful lawyer. Apparently this movie shows how Diaz evolves and becomes a better sister, and how Rose stops being so uptight and learns to live life. Personally, if I was Rose, I would never forgive Maggie. The Maggie character is a burden on Earth. Most of the movie is able to hold the viewer's attention but some parts are kind of boring. In Her Shoes is ok to watch once. I must have had high expectations because this movie did not live up to them."
3,it was interesting,"while the Movie went into alot of areas from to time&couldn't make up it's mind if it was gonna be serious or funny there was a good story line about the relationship of two sisters,there father&there grandmother. the film kinda flip-flopped on certain issues&things,but the film was alright.Cameron Diaz did alright. Shirley Mclaine was alright though she has been playing the same role since She did""Terms of Endearment"".this film had some good things going for it."
3,A bit disappointing,"I was a bit disappointed after watching In Her Shoes. It was pretty good, but not what I expected. Fairly predictable. Two sisters bonding with each other and their grandma. One gets married, one learns the meaning of life- and it doesn't have to include premarital relations. Not a movie for kids or a young teenager."
3,"It's good, but should have been better.","I liked 'In Her Shoes', there are some funny lines in the movie,but too much time was spent at the retirement home where Maggiegoes to mooch off her grandmother in Florida, and it sloweddown the movie and made it somewhat boring. I felt likeI was watching an episode of the 'The Golden Girls' most ofthe time. I felt the relationship between Maggie and her sister should been the primary focus of the film, not the relationshipbetween the estranged grandmother and the girls.Cameron Diaz is her usual adorable, irresistable self, and therest of the cast is good. I would like to see Hollywood giveCameron a chance to do a dramatic role to see if she has the versatility to do comedy and drama like Meg Ryan."
4,Definate Chick Flick,Being a guy I can't say I really wanted to see this movie. But after my fiancee bought it I ended up watching it with her one afternoon and it wasn't half bad. For being a Chick Flick there is a fair amount of guy humor and enough diversity that anyone can get drawn into the movie. Overall I'd say it is a typical Cameron Diaz movie.
2,Don't Waist Your Time...,"I read this book & it was AWESOME. But, the movie STINKS. I wanted so badly to like it but couldn't no matter how hard I tried. Cameron Diaz is a really bad actress & ruins a lot of movies, but even if there had been a different, more talented actress playing her character this movie would still put you to sleep."
2,Movie Moves Too Slow,"I love that it is about the lives of two sisters, but like I said in my title the movie moves too slow. It's not for me. I don't recommend this movie to anyone."
3,Excellent sentimental trash,"Let's get this out of the way:Most of the main characters are supposed to be Jewish. This did not become clear till late in the movie. Only two of the actors clearly are and this can be jarring.Then there's the fact that the movie is like a guy telling you a story by going on and on with the details and you're urging him, ""C'mon c'mon get to the punchline!"" The details are interesting but why are we here?But slowly it gets together, coalesces I guess is the word. And then emotional momentum grows and suddenly you are really glad you went.I went to see Toni Collette. I was not disappointed. But the movie only really clicks when Shirley Maclaine hits the screen.Is it a good movie with fine actors or a mediocre movie with fine actors? I have no idea. But late in the movie Maclaine, Diaz, and Collette are in one scene together, and if you can ignore the fact that they are supposed to be Jewish, it is great."
1,Very disappointing,"I liked Jennifer Weiner's book and even followed her columns about standing on the set watching this movie get made. My daughter and I then went to see this movie and we were both disappointed. The first problem is the casting - it is just impossible to see Cameron Diaz and Toni Collette as sisters. Collette never had a smile on her face and it was impossible to believe that she was an intelligent lawyer. Diaz's acting ranges from a to b (as Dorothy Parker once said about Katherine Hepburn). Shirley MacLaine was also woefully miscast as the grandmother; she barely phoned in her performance and never took on the role. This viewer was always conscious of watching Shirley MacLaine. There was also a problem with Curtis Hanson as the director; the movie just did not have the light touch of a romantic comedy and it dragged. On the other hand, Mark Feuerstein was one bright spot, even if there was no chemistry on screen between him and Toni Collette.I'd suggest saving your money."
3,Do her shoes fit?,"It's not a bad movie, I just lost interest half way through. I don't understand how then came up with this name for the movie."
5,"Wonderful story, impressive cast.","Funny, heart rending, and intelligent. The cast is superb and believable. The story line covers mental illness, sibling rivalry, blended families, over-coming disability and finding true love...something for everyone."
3,Decent chick flick,"Bought this for my oldest daughter to watch, good movie for ""opposite"" sisters to watch. I might even watch it with her, again."
4,fast delivery,the movie was in good condition but the sound wasn't loud enough so I had to turn it way up. Otherwise it was fine
5,Apropos,This DVD is Apropos per my regard to my relationship with my Big Sister. She is Smart and Responsible and married for 25 years now. I only hope to 'grow up' someday and have someone to love me and allow me to love him right back.
2,"Read the book, it's much better","If you like the movie, read the book. The movie itself left out a multiple key pieces of the book and drug out altogether too long. I found myself fast forwarding through parts of it just to get the end."
4,Happy & Sad,"It was a very fun movie. Hubby didn't care as much as I did - def a chick flick. I wish there could be a ""In her shoes II""."
1,Philips products are defect prone - beware!,"Failed to write, lost memory, damaged CDs, ruined over 40 blank CDs by failing in mid recording. EVERY Philips CD recorder we tried is junk! And forget their customer care even if you purchase their pricey coverage plan (which you will need if you buy their machines). The positive reviews appear to be people who were the fortunate few. Sadly Philips, which was one of the inventors of the CD technology, has failed to keep up their reputation in the CD recorder market. Buyer beware!"
4,double dubbing,"If our friend wants another good laugh,try getting the Yo-Yo's at Hardon Kardon motovated.My CDR26 dual recorder came back 3 times Un-fixed. It didnt last long anyway.Then I went and wasted 600 bucks on the Pioneer PDR839-Best recording ever!- As long as the seperate 3 draw tray doesenteat your CD.A big Double 0 for their custormer service dept also.Sometimes its the luck of the draw. These guys dont care, it'snot 1973 it's 2003. anyway-Thust me, I started recording back in the Reel to Reel days.For the working mans buck, the 820 is Top Flight!It takes the place of a Dual Draw recorder AND a 3 draw[ROTATING]CD player.Just dont ask it to do back flips.Thanks -"
4,Great size for soups,"I use these a lot for a variety of reheating purposes but probably my favorite are Trader Joe's French Onion soups. These are the perfect size and shape to heat these up, nothing else is even close. Seems to keep the soup hot longer enough for my typical speed of eating, and the lid does a nice job of keeping any mess off the roof of your microwave."
3,"Like the mug, hate the lid","I got this at the Williamsburg CorningWare outlet; the nice big mug has a wide mouth for easy access to all of your warmable goodies. My problem, however, is the lid - it has that little hole that is suppose to vent steam while microwaving, however it just turned my beef and barley soup this afternoon into a mini volcano while nuking it a few minutes. The result was major spillage in my workplace microwave. Problem number 2 arrived when I cleaned the lid (right after Mount St. Soup erupted) and found the lid was irreversibly stained any where the soup touched it. The CorningWare part cleaned easily and is still white and pristine, but after my first use of this product I now have a this-will-always-look-dingy stained lid to top it with. Grump. I do really like the CorningWare mug part, it's like the tall CorningWare ramekin with a handle (which can get warm, watch your fingers)."
1,Do not wash the lid in a dishwasher!,"The item functioned perfectly out of the box, however before the first use, I ran it through the dishwasher with the lid on the top rack, as per the instructions. Afterwards, I noticed that the lid no longer fit snugly to the mug and routinely comes off during use, resulting in a bowl of spilled soup. Very disappointing!"
3,It's ok but the price is higher than our local store,It's ok. But the price is even higher than our New York City local store.
3,Leakage,"I really love this mug, especially for work use. I try to avoid microwaving anything in plastic and this is a great replacement for Tupperware. My only complaint is that after I microwaved it with the lid on, the lid no long fits securely and whatever I bring to work leaks. Today it leaked minestrone all over, ruining my Kate Spade bag. Endless sadness abounds."
3,Not quite a mug...,"I ordered this looking for a large mug for my wife's coffee. It's difficult to gauge the size of the container from the web picture, so I thought this would be a good option. When the containers arrived, I realized they were huge bowl size, which may be perfect for reheating soup or maybe pastas or rice dishes, but certainly not for drinks. I think the term ""mug"" is a misnomer here. I would call this a bowl with a lid. I returned mine and am still looking for a ""mug"" that will fit a large Dunkin' Donuts coffee with a lid that is microwavable."
4,CorningWare 20-oz. Mug,"I wanted something that would hold a whole 2 cups of soup and this is it. It's also great for instant oatmeal. The lid fits really tight, and you need to be careful when removing it after heating something, but the whole thing works as well or better than I hoped. Bought two, one for backup when one is in the washing-up. Also cleans up easily, even dried oatmeal."
4,Nice big Cup,"The cup is portioned right with a thinning at the top which is what I was looking to get. The others I had were big, thick and heavy. This is a good size, great for soup, hot chocolate and grande coffee. The brand name CorningWare was sold a while ago so you should know its not the old owners. The cup is made in China along with all the other CorningWare and the price premium is still there."
4,Corningware Mugs,These mugs are great especially for soup. Just the right size and microwavable. They really heat up and stay hot. Just make sure you keep the little blue tab open to vent steam. Also they are pretty much stain proof. Had my set for many years.
3,i enjoy baking with these cup style baking wear but the lids are not the best.,the canister it self is awesome but the lid it comes with the blue part breaks off quite easily and the lids are a hassle to put on for some one with arthritis.
3,"Love the cups, hate the lids...","These cups are excellent for soup, chili and the like, whether heated in the microwave or just as serving bowls. They are absolutely perfect for this usage.Be aware however that the lids will stain, badly. If you heat chili or tomato soup or squash soup in the microwave, and it boils onto the lid, your lid is going to stain. I have only had these a few months, and already my lids are multicolored. Pink from tomato/red pepper soup, crimson from chili and yellow from butternut squash soup. While I have not experienced the brittleness some reviewers talked about yet, I consider the staining a major drawback to these. It looks ugly and unhygienic.5 stars for the cups themselves, 1 star for the lids, so 3 stars."
4,It's a fine mug,"All I really wanted was a 20oz mug and this fit the bill. I haven't figured out how the lid works. Are you supposed to be able to drink with it on? If so, how? If not, why bother with a lid? But it was the cup I wanted anyway."
1,This is NOT a mug - it is a small bowl and waste of money. Wrong size for anything.,"This was such a waste of money. It is NOT a mug, and it's so small you can't use it as a soup bowl. WHAT a waste of money. I used it so can't get a refund. Hello, Goodwill box."
2,Lid too difficult to remove,"The size of the cup is perfect, but the lid is way too hard to get off. I cannot imagine getting the lid off without spilling the contents. Also, the handle is a little small for the size of the mug. I like the cup, but the lid is impossible. I was disappointed with this product."
1,Made in China,My fault. I just ASSUMED Corningware was still made in the USA. It's not. Made in China with who knows what kind of glaze. Yuk.
2,not what I expected,This mug is not what I expected. I thought it would be something I could use for beverages. It is a soup mug and should be advertised as such. If it wasn't so expensive to return things I would have sent it back. If it was advertised as a soup mug I think it would be a good one.
4,good mug for microwave,purchased this mug based on previous reviews and I'm happy with it.I use it to cook oatmeal in the morning and the size is just right.Large enough for those instant oatmeal packet and the handle makes it safe to carry as the rest of the mug gets hot. Would recommend this to others.
3,CorningWare 1035985 French White 20-Ounce Mug,"The most appealing thing about this cup for me is the actual size. I wanted a mug that was larger than the average cup, which this is. However, there are certain pertinent information that is missing from the enclosed booklet,concerning a description of the cup, in general. For example; it doesn't state whether you should avoid taking the plastic cover off when placed into the microwave or not. Though such may seem self-explanatory,I expect to see the do's and don't written in the owner's manual by the manufacturer, I don't like guessing. The little enclosed manual they package the with the cup, alluded to only damages that could be done to the cup by the user,that even a baby would know they shouldn't do. A descriptive diagram of the cup and what it entails, which would take just a few sentences and a diagram was omitted. For me such is very important therefore my rating here reflects that."
2,"Good mugs, but fragile","I wanted a sturdy microwave cup or mug that I could use either at home or in the RV. These are certainly attractive, and I like being able to microwave things without worrying about the container being too shallow. However, I'm having problems with the lip area of the mugs chipping. Two mugs, bought at different times, have both chipped, making them unusable. They were not abused in any way, and other CorningWare I own hasn't chipped even though I use the pieces frequently. Could there be a design flaw where the lip of the mug flares out a bit? These mugs are too expensive to use just a few times. I won't replace the damaged mugs, and I'm looking for something less fragile."
3,Would probably be okay if it wasn't broken,"Item seemed perfect for someone who liked taking soup and such to work - big cup, handle, vented lid. Bought two of them, despite the fact that another buyer had posted a photo of a broken mug that he had ordered. My two cups arrived in the very same condition - both handles broken off. I sent them back, bought them at a Target instead."
4,Great product but shop around!,"It is nice to be able to count on Amazon to have what you need, when you need it, but after purchasing these, I saw them at WalMart for about 60% less than I paid on Amazon. I avoid Walmart as much as the next guy but wow. That's a big difference."
4,"Love these, but lids stain","I have 2 of these mugs and use them all the time for making soup and hot cereal in the microwave, sometimes even to eat cold cereal from. If you have anything left over, they go right into the fridge to save for later. The only downfall is that anything with tomato will stain the lids so that no matter how clean you get them, there is still that sense that they are not really CLEAN. Sometimes I will put a small square of plastic wrap on top and forget about the lid altogether. Also, the lids do fit very tightly and it is sometimes tricky to get your hand out of the way of steam as you pry off the lid. Just use a towel to as a barrier, though. The handles stay cool enough to hold while you eat your hot food, which might be the most important feature. I have seen that you can get these in a dark red color (only the outside) and they look attractive, so I plan to buy another pair."
5,Great office solution.,"This is a great product. Unlike the other similar products in Amazon, this one is not make of plastic, so it is not just a bowl with a lid and a vent. This container heats the soup evenly and without a mess. I use it in my office to eat soups for lunch."
5,Love it,Just the right size for office tea time. I love to take large quantities of milk & hot chocolate before I start working for a 90 minute session. This works perfectly & the lid actually helps keep it warm.
5,love this mug!,"Mug heats very evenly. I use this for everything - soup, rice, stir fry.. I like the convenience of the handle.. makes bring lunch to work a breeze! Cleanup is easy also. Will be buying one more!"
3,"I am happy with it, but.........","First of all, this is an OK dvd player. Toshiba does make great products, but this is an exception. ... but the size is an issue. It isn't that big, but when you put on the battery pack it transforms to a much bigger size. Also the picture quality is worse than my tv. I would have no problem with these down sides, but the fact remains that it costs ... dollars. With new technology, computers have dropped tremendously. ...The fact is, that these portable dvd players will soon be outdated by laptops which can do the same, but with more functionality. I would recommend you keeping your money, and then waiting for a good laptop to come on sale. There are plenty of bargains out there for [the price] or less."
4,Fun Toy - Buy Quality Not Size,"This is a nice, full-featured DVD player that for its expanded screen size is still very portable. I did think there was some drop-off in picture quality from some smaller screen sizes I've used, but this one can be adjusted to perfect the display without too much trouble."
3,THIS MOVIE WAS ALRIGHT,"WORTH SEEING ONCE. EX-CON SHADOW (BOKEEM WOODBINE) FINDS OT DIFFICULT ADJUSTING TO SOCIETY, HIMSELF, AND HIS DEDICATED WIFE, SHARON (DEBORAH COX). AFTER HIS RELEASE, HE IS LUREDBY THE BRUTAL SPORT OF UNDERGROUND STREET FIGHTING, CONTROLLED BY MERCILESS BUSINESSMAN DRIVEN BY MONEY, VIOLENCE AND GREED. STARRING: DEBORAH COX AND BOKEEN WOODBINE."
4,East L.A. Rock &Roll!,"Well produced album,original tunes,and conceptual continuity provided by F.Z. himself. Definitely a must for the collectors. Their first album, ""Con Safos"" is as good or possibly better, depending on taste of course, but has a killer version of ""Honky Tonk"". Buy it, you'll like it!"
3,CONFUSING,THIS GAME WAS PURCHASED FOR ME TO USE WITH MY STUDENTS WHOM NEED EXTRA HELP AND PRACTICE WITH READING. THIS GAME IS VERY VERY CONFUSING AND IT PAUSES AND TAKES A LONG TIME TO TRASITION. IT WORKS BUT I AM NOT HIGHLY IMPRESSED.
4,Amazing set from Byrd,"This is an amazing set from Byrd, Pearson and Pepper Adams, when all were at the top of their game."
3,not as great as I thought,"I purchased this bible in the burgundy bonded leather for my husband. I have another study bible that I like better than this one because of the page layout. The verse numbers are not spaced in a margin for quick reference on the pages and it is not laid out in columns as a traditional bible. They run across the width of the entire page and the verse number is tucked right into the verse line, making it difficult to see. Comparing this one with mine, I definitely prefer mine. As far as the study portion and information given in this bible go, it looks very similar to the Zondervan KJV study bible that I use. Also they sent me one that was not thumb indexed although the listing stated it was. If that's what you are looking for be sure that's is what you are getting before ordering."
1,Unsure of Print Size,"I decided to purchase this Bible because the adult Sunday School teacher uses one and I was very impressed with it. I ordered the Bible from Amazon thinking it would be regular print but I got a large print version which had more pages than were listed under the product details. The product details do not specify large print as there are also large print Bibles from this same publisher. After combing through the reviews, I am still unsure if this Bible comes in regular print and the Amazon representatives were unable to say if it does. Since I returned the Bible because it was large print, I do not want to reorder knowing I may get the same thing because nobody at Amazon seems to be able to say whether the Bible is available in regular print. I am hoping someone will see this review and be able to help me."
3,Nice but sometimes deceptive,"I bought this bible for myself and my wife but after reading some of the comments on the bible texts I found some of them to be too much of the writers opinion, but they appear to make it sould like fact.I think only as far as the maps and facts in the comments should this bible be considered. But when it comes to the opinion of the author..let The Bible speak for itself. Be careful when reading the comments."
3,Not the Best Study Bible,"I've always liked how the King James Bible sounded, and this Bible does a good job of making it entertaining. Unfortunately the strength of the actual translation is killed, and unfortunately this bible has no soul to be saved, because of the actual study notes which are pretty silly at times. They try to remain non-demoninational but seem to be courting towards the Moderate-Conservative Christians the closer you get to the Gospels. Which I don't praticuarlly like, but then again, I'm not a mainstream Christian, so I shouldn't much complain."
1,atlas and differential diagnosis of hematopathology,"As soon as you find the orientation to the figures, you find a whealth of data regarding the morphology, immunohistochemistry and genetic changes on most of the topics covered by neoplastic hematopathology. Moreover, the documentation is usually of high quality and it is highly pertinent.This type of book is often used to a lesser extent than more classical books and it is a pity. In this case it is especially a pity, since the book is expensive.I would nevertheless recommend it to each Unit of Hematopathology."
4,WILL HAVE YOU THINKING......,"I love this book! The only reason I could not give it a five stars was because I am a true EJD fan sorry.For all females who live the life of overcoming the fear of your sexuality this book is for you. It take your thoughts to where you feel most comfortable and relaxed. When you are done reading this book you just want to tell the world, ""hey I am a lesbian and who cares.""I love this book! There will be times when you have read it over and over again, then one day you choose to read it again. I recommend this book for females questioning their sexuality, this book will help you embrace who you are."
3,ok,i want to thrilled about this book it was slow and kinda boring i dont recall if i even finished it
3,Just a simple story,"Not impressed...This is the second book I have read by this author.Now dont get me wrong it read good,but just not for me."
4,Recommended blf,"Read this book a while ago, but I remember wishing that the first part of the book wasn't included. There was really no explanation about why Sinclair would even do the the things that she did with Regina or even feel so strongly for her. This part of the book and the subsequent part (when Sinclair goes to Jamaica) felt like to different stories, and the latter was better. I also found myself wanting resolution with the way the book ended. Was a good time and good sex really enough for Sinclair? F. Zedde laced the book with great descriptions."
2,Just OK,The storyline was okay. I really found it interesting that the author was very vivid about how those of the gay community are treated in Jamaica. I dated a Jamaican before (lesbian couple) and she would only tell me that our lifestyle was not accepted in her country. So I'm glad I could get a little more understanding from reading this book.
3,JUST BUY THE PULLUPS... YOU DON'T NEED THE BOOKLET AND STICKERS.... REALLY!,"I THOUGH, GREAT, ALL IN ONE PACKAGE..... BUT THE STICKERS AND CHARTS, ETC DON'T DO A THING FOR MY DAUGHTER.... AND YOU NEED LOTS OF PANTS, ONLY A FEW ""REWARDS"" ANYHOW!"
2,kit very old and not needed,"just buy the pull-ups. This kit is not needed. The wipes were died out and the coupons expired in dec2006, I got kit in spring 2008."
4,very nice,"Got this for my wife.She doesn't like yellow gold and usually gets white gold or platinum.I figured some silver would ease the expense and it looks good.It is constructed very well.The links are very even and it flexs well.You can see the joint where the ends meet, but that is typical."
2,start of something good,"this particular set had me cracking up in the beginning, but then it got too mature,then too serious,for a quirky comedy."
5,Outstanding and personal customer service,I made an error in the mailing address and this company bent over backward to make sure I still received the product on time! Fast and courteous replies to every email. Outstanding service!
1,HP customer service is USLESS,"I would have given it a zero if I could. Do not bother buying an HP their service is terrible. My hinge broke on my notebook. I called HP to purchase the part and they told me they cannot sell one to me. However, they do have the part to fix it if i pay them $300. What a joke. I would put any HP at the very bottom of you list."
4,Not just another growl-fest,"I'm into boating these days. Well, rafting really. There's been no surf, so my buddies and I have invested in some rubber rafts that we take out on the ocean. What this means is that I will probably drown and I hope I don't go to hell because then I would have to hang out with 100 Demons and these guys are seriously scary. While their sound reminds me of both Slayer and Hatebreed, they are certainly no derivative act. 100 Demons are capable of squeezing maximum power and savage imagery into every second of the twenty-six minute release; the whole effort dripping with unbelievably thick, massive crunches of noise. With tons of unresolved issues and unadulterated aggression, 100 Demons take out their tortured souls and mercilessly punish you with their heavy, horrifying sound. Huge thank yous are in order to producer Zeuss for making something that sounds like music, rather than putting out just another growl-fest."
3,sometimes change is not for the better.,"finally the long awaited 2nd album from connecticut hardcore legends 100 demons has arrived!! but unfortunately, along with new songs comes new members. Bruce LePage (vocals)is no longer with the DEMONS, as well as Steve Karp (bass player). instead the demons are now joined with Pete Morcey (former Forced Reality vocalist) & Erik Barrett. you would think with all the time they had since there 1st album they would have put ALOT more effort into this album. trust me, the 1st album is OFF THE WALL MADNESS!! truly original & a masterpiece in my eyes. so, if you plan on buying a 100 demons cd, get the 1st album then get this one & you'll see what i mean. checkout other hardcore bands such as - subzero, hatebreed, merauder, sick of it all, burn, rorschach, citizens arrest, born against, & the list goes on."
1,Stay Away From This One,"Recently bought one of these used, but in good shape (apparently). The cd-recorder worked ok for a while, but gradually refused to burn cds. I suspect this is a symptom of a bad product, not a malfuntion specific to the particular unit. This problem is consistent with other reviews I have read here and elsewhere. I should have listened. If you need a consistently good stand-alone cd burner, buy a Tascam unit."
3,"Pretty good, but I can understand not liking it. 3 1/2 stars.","It's described as a relatively mainstream hitman movie, but it turns out to have bizarre subplots. Definitely the movie to see if you're into Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s butt. I think if it was advertised more honestly, it would have attracted viewers who were into the weird combination of sex and violence, and it would have better ratings. The direction is good, the script is good, the story completely unbelievable, even the gangsters are not believable, but the two leads are excellent, and it's fun, if bizarre to watch."
5,Outstanding !,"What a refreshingly different, entertaining movie! We loved it.Cuba Gooding, Jr. just shines and is fabulous. He has such presence as the disturbed assassin. He really carries off the whole film. Mirren, Dorrf, & the woman who plays the wife of the mobster were terrific also. I admired the unpredictability of the plot. The screenplay was well done. Highly recommended if you want to watch a movie that casts its own mold. Original, extremely well-acted.Cuba Gooding Jr. is one of the most under-appreciated & under-utilized actors of our time. His screen presence is very strong. I'd love to see him in more movies. Gooding's versatile, and good-looking without being smarmy or smirky. I have just become a big fan after watching him in this movie."
5,Something for everyone..but not the kiddies,"I thought this film would be yet another skin flick with more gratuitous [...] shots than a porn film (which may explain why some think this movie sucks). It's very refreshing to see most (not all) of the sex scenes done tastefully. I was almost at the point where I truly believed film makers no longer had an imagination and only fed into the psyches of an adolescent audience. I'm amazed at how this film combined such violence with compassion; you can feel the turmoil of emotions the assasins felt. I applaud this film for showing us genuine compassion, loyalty, and love."
2,There is no excuse for wasting Helen Mirren.,"But this movie manages to do it. Two decent people became hired killers, and the motivation is unconvincing (they don't seem to need the money that badly). Also, this is the kind of movie in which a doctor with a lighted cigarette in his mouth examines a new-born baby -- and no one seems to think it's strange.You might want to rent this movie to see Cuba Gooding Jr. -- he's the very essence of cool in a scene in which he picks up a woman in a bar, intending to kill her to fulfill a contract."
4,shadowboxer video,"Cuba Gooding ususally always makes for an enjoyable surprising performance so why shoulf ""Shadowboxer"" be any different? Recieving the viodeo was as simple as pie, and the video I have already seen but it is so entertaing that I had to have a inexpensive copy of my own and I thank you. The preview of the product was flawless and I recived what I expected, shortly after placing my order- within 7 days. EXCELLENT! once again"
3,Where's the version I saw at the theater?,"This ""R"" rated version is not the same unrated one I saw at the movies last summer. Why is the unrated version not available???"
1,"This sucked bigtime, very bad movie,","This was one of the worst movie I have ever seen, we had to fast forward through some very boring stuff. Ok, I'll sum it all up for you: two killers, one black, one white. white girl has cancer, still can kill people. Mob boss has pregnent wife to kill, killers find Jeasus and deliver baby while dead bodies are all over the house. Baby grows up, kills daddy. Lots of sex, lots of bad acting. [...], This sucked."
5,Fast Delivery,"I rcv'd my item in like 2-3days. The DVD is in excellent condition, and it's a movie that I had seen years ago, and wanted it in my collection. I get all my DVD's from Amazon! Quick, and inexpensive. I mean who can beat 1 cent on movies, even with the S & H it's still less than Wal-Mart or any place else. I would buy from this user again!"
1,Worst movie in History,"This movie is simply the worst film that ever existed in the face of this planet. By all means, if you are the type of individual that loves killer movies that make absolutely no sense then this for you. On the other, it only requires a fair amount of logic to realize this is THE WORST MOVIE ON THE PLANET. Plot makes no sense, acting is really bad, Cuba just sits there and wait to get his finger cut off so he can fight..... man the nightmares goes on. Stay away from this movie at all cost.... Stay Away! It's really that bad."
1,Cuba Gooding Jr. WORSE Movie hands down!,"This movie was slow and boring! I mean boring with a capital B! The plot was thin and silly, I mean the are hired hitmen and they dont kill this one chick because she's pregnant, do they leave her?? No, they take her along with them! What a joke of a plot! Even if your a fan of Cuba Gooding Jr., this film will be played ONCE and then just collect DUST!"
3,Ghetto dr. phil is right....,"The title should've been ""The Ghetto Dr. Phil"" because that's all we talked about... relationships. Funny but short as hell. I love Corey Holcomb but you just beg him to expand his material because he's so clever."
2,Needlessly Confusing,I used this text in a class taught by the author. I found the text to be needlessly confusing when compared to similar products. The book jumps from concept to concept without providing a firm basis on which to base off of. The only thing that saved me in class was relying instead on Best's Examples and Explanations of Evidence. Evidence can be taught in a clear and concise manner.
5,great history book,"being a history major, i love history already so may have a bit of a bias. however this is a great book for anyone interested in irish history. you never get lost of confused, it is well organized, and logical to follow. unlike many history books, it is a fun read and never gets boring. before going to ireland for a month over the summer i read this book and it was great because it gave interesting history to know before i went. also does a great job of looking at the conflict that started over british rule and the politics behind it. i would reccomend this book to anyone. Slainte!"
3,A bit boring,"I bought this book to get a sense of Irish history since I expect to travel there this summer. However, instead of giving an overview of Irish history, this book is mainly essays by Irish history professors written for a Irish audience. So, this is not a good book for people who want a basic working knowledge of Irish history, it is for more advanced history majors. It has taken me months to get through this book."
3,A difficult book to follow,I gave this book only three stars because even though it is a good scholarly work it is difficult to get through. There is a lot of historical information in here that appears without any explanation. It is really written for those with a sound background to Irish history. I found myself getting lost a few times with references to events that were not fully explained. Sometimes you come across a reference to a law or an institution and there is no further reference. Although the work and scholarship is thorough it is not a good read for those exploring Irish history for the first time.
1,Poorly written,"I purchased this book and have read it for a course on Irish History at the University of Washington. The book is poorly put together. Because there are different authors for each section the book completely lacks continuity.I don't recommend this book if you are looking for a straight-forward, accessible read."
3,needed for class,"I needed this book for my last masters class and it did the trick. It was easy to follow and understand. It didn't have the most exciting information in it, but then again I didn't buy it for entertainment."
5,"Hi i'm John, i'm a recovering Pharisee!","John Fischer is a honest-till-it-hurts kinda writer. He asks the questions no-one else wants to ask or hear. That's why this book is a must read. John helps us to look honestly into the mirror and recognise the 'pharisee'.Cleverly using the steps of AA, but changing it to fit a new context, makes for fascinating reading. This isn't a how-to book. This is a thought-provoking look into the mirror. Healing and recovery begins by admitting: ""I'm a Pharisee, please help.""This book is a welcome addition to Fischer's collection of challenging and thought-provoking books.""Hi, i'm Francois, i'm a recovering Pharisee."""
5,Excellent Book about re-thinking Christian Love,"This book is great at demonstrating that we can all be judgemental at times. John Fischer tells personal stories that are very vulnerable and hit close to home. It is very encouraging and convicting to think about loving like Jesus does rather than picking apart anyone who is different. He uses the 12-step recovery model to show that it takes some real effort and honest self-evalutation to move from being a person who lives to do everything ""right"" to a person who is forgiven and ready to give grace and love to others instead."
2,It's a Start.,"John Fischer must be given credit for pointing out to his fellow evangelicals what is obvious to those considered 'unsaved'(everyone who doesn't believe as they do.) The error, common to most of this genre, is the flawed protestant theology leading to the very hypocrisy and self-righteousness which concerns the author. The fault lies in equating the terms conversion and salvation. Conversion being repentance and faith, the start of the journey....salvation-the hope and end of the journey....IF you pick up your cross daily, IF you obey all I have commanded and IF you endure to the end. The book is riddled with the common errors of the faith alone, once saved always saved crowd. It's called the sin of presumption and is the same old lie from the garden....you shall be as gods. He is right to be appalled at this imitation christianity. He recommends C.S. Lewis' Surprised by Joy. I recommend to him and his readers, Patrick Madrid's Surprised by Truth. A good start for the journey home."
2,headache,"THe book was okay. By the time I got to the 6th step I had a headache. I know we are all sinful at the heart and are capable of even murder but some the chapters seemed to create areas of guilt that mature Christian should have overcome through Christ. Even though I know that we all sin and need to be examining ourselves daily for cleansing I did not feel cleansed after reading the book. It felt like a pharisee rebuking another pharisee. We all deal with pharisee-like behavior but I think reading the Bible is the way to deal with it.....not a ""12 step"" program from another pharisee's mind. Go to God's Word!!!!!!"
5,Grace,"It's all about Grace. We don't deserve what we get. We must accept it or we will miss it. None of us will be perfect. Unlike the Pharisees who already are. Do we have to remind ourselves, why did Jesus die? I personally wrote to John Fischer and thanked him for pointing me back on that Narrow Road. I veered way off course because of all of the Pharisee mentality that I saw in the church that I use to attend. After reading this book, I feel good again about my relationship with Christ. It's about a relationship (Jesus) and not religion (Pharisee). The best book that I've read written on Grace. I recommend this book to all who are sick of religion. Thanks John Fischer!If you like the style of Philip Yancey and C.S. Lewis, you'll love the way John Fischer writes."
1,oh yeah,"not bad but conservatism = no progress ? I'm not an American, but have you noticed how the great American political heroes have actually been radicals not conservatives?"
1,Ditto,"Same comment as the previous reviewer: the item shipped is NOT the item depicted here, which is actually quite frustrating. I ordered this third party item instead of an official adapter because it was more compact. For that reason and because Amazon was the only place where I could find this compact adapter, I chose to pay the amount Amazon charges rather than buy a cheaper adapter off of an auction site. I was confident in my purchase because the item is listed as sold by Amazon rather than some eBayer or no-name merchant.You can buy the exact item Amazon shipped to me much cheaper on eBay, and if you want to spend this amount of money on an ""official"" purchase the Nokia adapter looks much more compact (which is saying something, since it isn't compact at all). You should absolutely not buy this gangly Chinese-manufactured adapter here, though."
2,Item not as shown,The item I received is not what is shown in the Amazon photo. The photo shows a one piece unit with a 3.5mm headphone jack. The item shipped has a long wire with the jack on the end. Not as neat as the item shown. Style numbers match up so Amazon has the wrong photo. Be careful. Check before ordering.
1,Did not get item shown,"The adapter I received did not resemble the item advertised. What I received was a mono adapter. Totally useless, but not worth paying to send it back."
2,Partially functional,"I received the product, but it didn't match the photo on the website at all. I also noticed that the call button is triggered even if it hasn't been pushed. The result is that my phone attempts to dial constantly making the phone unusable. I did work around the problem by switching the microphone switch to off. The product is either defective, or not compatible with my phone. My advice would be to stick to the products directly from Nokia's website."
4,Good but messy,"Would like to rate a 5 but found the application brush messy . the jar needs a lip to scrape excess ""rubber "" substance off acid brush applicator. Stuff works though!"
5,Philips CD Recorder,This is great product from Philips. I didn't know what I buying initially because I had a Harmon/Kardon CD26 recorder which I thought was the best in it's category out there. The Philips is just as good and very easy to use as well. I love this product and will recomment it to anyone deciding if they should a CD recorder. It without a doubt preceed my expectations.
4,Ok item,Purchased this for my 96 blazer. Item was a little flimsy but worked for me. Had to super glue the little cubby in because it kept popping out while I was driving. But over all pleased with my order.
4,1996 Chevy Blazer,"It fits but I had to use some zip ties to hold the stereo in place because it does not have any way to secure the stereo to the mount. I could have possibly overlooked or done something wrong but I promise I looked on the instuctions that came with the product over and over. I also looked at the mount and the stereo, there was nothing there. It does fit the vehicle just fine and bolts right up however. I only had a hard time actually attaching the stereo to the actual kit.Product works. Could have just been the aftermarket stereo I was using."
4,Memories of Russia,"My Mom got this book and was reading it. I liked the picture on the cover, and looked for more pictures. And then Mom asked if I would like to read something about Russia. I was born there, but I don't remember much about it. I started reading just because Mom asked for it, but then I kinda liked it, and read 2 more stories. It is not like anything I read before, almost like fiction, but I still liked it."
1,Exploded during first use,"We have used Pyrex in the past and been pleased with it. However the first time we used this item, to pour hot tea into it, the cup shattered. Exploded might be a better word since the glass shards shot everywhere. We have an older 1 quart Pyrex cup that we have used for years for this same purpose without problem. As such, I am not inclined to believe that we were using this product improperly. This leaves either a defective individual product or a larger issue with manufacturing or materials. I will likely try a borosilicate glass product in the future. On a positive note, I purchased this product from Amazon and they refunded my money."
1,Pyrex is no more,"It turns out that this mixing bowl is not made by corel, and is not the high quality high temperature glass originally used. Corel sold of it's Pyrex brand to another company called World Kitchen. WK uses common bottle glass for all it's Pyrex line, rather than the 'lab glass' that made pyrex worth buying.I was forced to purchase a replacement for the 16 year loyal pyrex measuring that finaly broke. It arrived today, complete with defective bubbles and cracks through both the handle and bowl. Return shipping will cost more than the item did to purchase, so I am out of luck.If you are looking for the quality pyrex that has been used for generations, you are out of luck. It has not been made for a while now."
2,Does NOT pour cleanly,Liquids sheet down the side of the cup and off the bottom rather than pouring out in a clean arc. I've tried varying the angle and speed of the pour with no improvement.
2,Pyrex has gone downhill,"I have seem pyrex that has survived generations, unfortunately something has changed and I have had 3 pieces literally explode, in the oven, on the stove, even just sitting on the stove top after being used. My latest was a 2 quart measure (see additional product photos) I was reheating some coffee, I brought it to a boil accidently but then turned off the stovetop. I poured myself a cup without incident but about 5 minutes later I hear an explosion in the kitchen and find glass and coffee everywhere!I don't know what is going on at the pyrex plant but I will not be buying anymore of it. Maybe a trip to the antique store is in order?"
1,broken handle,"The handle was broken, it had a serious chip snd a crack that ran through the handle where it met the cup. I had to rrtirn it immediately."
4,Loved it 'til it exploded!,"This is a much-used item in my kitchen. The size is great for preparing many recipes. I've used it for jam making, mixing meatloaf, mixing all sorts of batters. I purchased it in 2008, and unfortunately in August of 2011, it exploded in my sink after I had put some wooden-handled knives and odds & ends utensils in it with soap & water. At the time, I had not read or heard of Pyrex exploding, but a few weeks later read in Consumer Reports about others' experiences. It has been replaced and I am hoping the chances of it happening again are nil as I love this item and have found it to be SO useful."
4,Good Product,"I don't understand all the comments about boiling coffee on top of a stove and not expecting a bad outcome. Pyrex clearly states that you shouldn't do this. Also, from my chem major days, decades ago, I don't recall using Pyrex measuring glass to boil things on top or stoves.This measuring cup is great to microwave sauces, puddings, candy, etc. and that is primarily what I use it for. I previously had an Anchor Hocking 8 cup measuring cup that I broke(not on a stove top, but by dropping a jar on it - don't use these things for wash basins!) and got the Pyrex because it was cheaper than the Anchor Hocking 8 cup. The Anchor Hocking design has a better handle and etched measuring lines. The Pyrex has a steeper design so it is slightly less likely to boil over. Also, the measure lines are painted on the Pyrex so they are easier to read but may wash off over time if you use a dishwasher."
5,HUGE measuring cup,I looked high and low for a large measureing cup to use in the microwave to make my Diabetic Fathers sugar free peanut brittle. The first one arrived broken but was quickly replaced. Works great and makes the best SF peanut brittle with ease~!
2,"poor handle design, not enough measurement granularity","The handle is too short. Even when less than half-full, this cup is uncomfortable to carry. It feels like the handle is slipping out of the hand. This is especially unpleasant and potentially dangerous with a liter or two of boiling hot water. The handle needs to be at least 2cm longer or a be a full loop.The markings are printed at an angle. It's barely perceptible, but nevertheless noticeable. There should be more markings. You can only measure from 2 cups up in one cup intervals, or from 16oz up in 16 oz intervals (or do some math) or 500ml and up in 250ml intervals. There is plenty of space for more marks."
3,MAW Can Do No Wrong!,What can I say about this team that hasn't already been said? The combination of music they mix is mind-blowing! You can never go wrong with this duo-- they will move you like no other!
5,nice edition to the bedroom!,"tasty and fun edition to the bedroom. both the husband and I love it :) it tastes great but be warned, it is definitely SUPER sticky so know what you're getting into and plan a shower after! lol"
3,Too thick/sticky,"I think this is more of a gift item rather than one that I would buy for regular use. The container that it comes in is very cute and the bottle is glass, so the presentation would be perfect for a bachelorette party/bridal shower type event. The strawberries and champagne scent is very nice! Definitely not over-powering and it's a lighter strawberry scent for those of you who are worried about it being more like cough syrup.The oil itself is a little thicker and stickier than what I'm used to. I like silicon-based lubes that are more liquidy and smoother to the touch. This one dries out quicker and is on the thick side. Overall, a nice novelty gift to give, but I probably won't be using it too often."
3,A little too self-indulgent (and dreamy),I have long been a fan of the Robin Williamson and his earlier work in ISB. This album is a bit too self-indulgent and not what I would have hoped.
2,Dogs haven't touched it,So far my puppies will play with or chew on anything BUT this. I do like nylabone brand but this isn't the best so far....
4,Rottweiler's new toy,"This toy is super cute. For a full size rottweiler, this toy is just too small, but I have a rescue and she is a lot smaller than your typical rott. I got the ""long neck"" dinosaur (clearly I'm a Land before time era kid) and it is fine. I think it may have been a little sharp, as the first day I noticed a little spot of blood on the toy where it probably caught her tongue or gums. She still plays with it periodically. It's a very bright white toy, so it's easy to see. Hopefully, it will stand up to my dogs chewing, but I don't think it's meant for larger, stronger chewers. I would think a lab or smaller would benefit from this toy."
5,Dogs best friend,My 3 dogs love these fun chew toys… they last several months even with my very aggressive chewers! I have been purchasing these for several years now.
3,Disappointing,"Looks like a nubby cake of soap, no larger and no more designed. The dog chews on it but its smaller than it should be and won't last long."
1,Nyla not of original quality,"Nylabone Dinosaur is not the same quality it used to be. Originals were softer plastic, more chewy and could be worn down. Good for teeth. This one is too hard.. Dogs won't chew on it. Original was clear dark yellow colored these are solid white. Totally useless."
4,Dinosaur Bone,"My dog enjoys this bone and it seems to be durable. Just be careful not to step on it, OUCH."
1,not for dogs with healthy teeth and gums,"This toy was torn to shreds and pieces coming off into their mouths in less than 10 minutes of chewing. Fear of ingestion an issue, and really could not see this passing easily in their digestive system..."
5,Chew toy,Took the toy out to show my dogs. My older dog immediately wanted to chew on it which is great because she is not usuallyinterested in new toys. Should be good on their gums. Looks big online so check out the measurements so you are notdisappointed.
5,Great for aggressive chewers!!,Love this toy! lasts forever and parts cant be chewed off to swallow!! great for puppies and large aggressive chewers!
1,nylabone,neither dog will have anything to do with the toy both of them a gave it a once over chewed on in it for about a minute then tossed it assided and wouldnt have anything to do with it. we tried playing with them but they just wernt intereseted. not worth the money spent at all\
1,dog doesn't like it,My dog is not interested in this bone at all. He doesn't chew on it and will only play with it if I throw it in the yard as a fetching stick.
5,"Life, furniture and socks saver!",Ok I have two cute little terrors... I mean terriers.One of my dogs has jaws of steel! Before I discovered Nylabone he lived a toyless life because he ate (YES ATE) every toy he was given. I ordered it on a whim after reading a positive review for Nylabone products. My dog has had this toy for almost a year now and it is still going strong! I will and always will continue to purchase these products. Trust me they are awesome!
1,Lost a little respect for Nylabone,"This has to be one of the most disappointing dog bone purchases i have made. This is a bone that is recommended for strong chewers, something that is required for my dog. Unfortunately, he had the head off of the t-rex within 10 minutes, and he swallowed it before i could get it away from him. From now on, it's all about durability, and nothing about looks. If your dog is a heavy chewer, be wary of this product!"
2,NOT durable,"I received this product in the mail yesterday. It was a different dino than pictured, but the description notes that it pay be. My dog (a 35 lb beagle/lab) chewed most of it up by last night. Other Nylabone products are fine for him, but this one doesn't look like it will last long. Also, it is a lot smaller than I anticipated."
5,Keeps my dogs busy & Occupied!,"This dino is my dog's favorite toy. They love the shape and the taste. It's easy to hold in thier small dachshund paws, and because of the odd shape there are many angles to choose from. Nylabone is a fabulous company that cares greatly about customer service - email them and you'll see! They are so friendly and wonderful, we'll be customers for life!"
4,Great product! Only I thought I'd get three of them,"My dog loves this dinosaur, hes an 11lb chihuahua terrier mix and is a tough little chewer so this is perfect. I ordered this thinking I was going to get three 'assorted' dinosaurs but you actually only get one hence only 4 stars. I ended up with the stegasaurus which my doggie loves so I highly recommend this chew toy as it works a treat but remember, YOU ONLY GET ONE!"
2,My dog does not chew this,I purchased this and several other nylabone products for my new puppy and older dog. Neither of them use the nylabones - they have sat in the corner untouched since purchasing. Give your dog a bone instead......
4,Decent bone,"This was a good bone for our large breed puppy. She seemed to prefer it over other bones and toys. Maybe because of the shape or the smaller edges and ends. The head was the first to go but the rest is still mostly intact after 3 months of puppy chewing. Nylabone make good, durable bones for aggressive chewers."
5,A chew toy my dog and kids love,"My boys love dinosaurs and loved giving this to our German Shephard for Christmas. Our dog loves to chew on it, but be careful not to step on it with bare feet. It is rather sharp and pokey ;-)"
3,THought I was getting a T-rex...,"Thought I was getting a T-rex, but got a brontosaurus. It's a chew toy, so can't be that picky I guess. Four month old puppy loves it, but doesn't chew too much on it yet- I think its too hard a material for her yet. She loves it just the same and hides it from the cats."
2,Dinosaur chew toy,"My dog loved chewing on this dinosaur toy but after a couple of months he managed to finely shred it to the point that about 20% of it was missing/ingested. It didn't seem to cause any digestive problems but was disconcerting nonetheless. We've had better luck with another Nylabone product, theDouble Action Combo Bone Chew Toy, which is still going strong after 4+ years."
5,One of my dog's favorite toys!!!,"My sister bought this for her 2 weims who are both aggressive chewers. I've never seen toys destroyed so fast! They both LOVE this toy and it lasts quite awhile. I decided to buy one for my husky. It's one of his favorites often played with. It is a hard thick plastic toy with some weight to it. My dog and my sister's dogs, they all have chewed the crap out of it to the point it doesn't look like a dinosaur anymore! Oh and they constantly carry it around with them and drop it on your toes. Ummm yeah OUCH!The one drawback (and warning) of this toy is that the teeth marks left in it can cause sharp or rough edges. Some fragments are chewed off and left on the floor. However, I still give it 5 stars or should I say 5 paws!!! I already bought a 2nd one to keep on hand once I'm ready to throw the old one in the trash."
4,torn...,"I'm a little torn between 4 & 5 stars...Daisy (25-lb. terrier / minpin / border collie mix) absolutely LOVES LOVES LOVES this toy. I actually had to stop her from chewing it when I first gave it to her. If I had let her, she probably would have chewed for another hour (since she had gone a full hour without stopping for anything). The only downside (and I don't know if her teeth are still setting, but I know she has all her adult teeth so it can't be that her baby teeth are still falling out) is that her gums were bleeding after. I found traces of blood on the toy as well. I'm sure it is natural for her gums to bleed a little as the toy is pretty sharp, but I am limiting her use of it regardless. If we are talking about how much she loves it, however, it's 5,000 stars. lol...."
3,Not for Powerful Chewers,"My dog (45lb terrier mix) loves to chew on things, and can go through even the ""virtually indestructible"" bones. With that said, he LOVES this bone (we got the stegosaurus), but he made a dent in it within the first 5 minutes. I wish Nylabone would take the ""virtually indestructible"" material and shaped into fun shapes like this. Luckily the dino chews are rather inexpensive so I don't mind getting these for him but be wary if your dog has big strong teeth and don't want to keep buying them."
4,Dogs LOVED it!,"We have two year old pit mixes and a 5 month old APBT, who are medium to aggressive in chew style. A lot of times the nylabones get overlooked or hidden deep under the couch, but this one was a cherished toy. Our male would carry this around, showing it off to everyone. All three really enjoyed the texture, and it lasted a good month before it was sent to chew toy afterlife."
1,large dental bill,"I purchased these because I thought they were safe for my dog. I was horribly mistaken. My dog cracked two of his teeth, chewing on this. I heard the crack and saw the blood on the bone. I took him to the vet and he had to have two cracked teeth removed. This product should not even be on the market. Had we not caught this, the vet told me, that there is no warning for a tooth infection and dogs can easily die. Do not buy this product. I cannot believe that the company continues to market this. This product is hurting the dogs. It was a very hefty dental bill and I haven't even addressed what my dog went through having to be put under and not have a major molar to chew his regular dog food."
1,Dinosaur extict within 20 minutes of chewing,"I was so excited for this product, it's the first toy I've bought my new rescue dog. However, the Dinosaur Dental Chew was chewed and mangled within the first 20 minutes...I thought they were supposed to non-edible...he's seems to have been able to eat the non-edible ""durable"" toy though :("
2,Pretty heavy,This looks like a figurine in actual. It's pretty heavy for my 5 month old puppy. I felt like she is lifting a rock and I was concern that her jaw might hurt.
3,Nylabone Durable Dental Chew,"This chew toy had for powerful chewers printed on the front of it, but my powerful chewer chewed into at least half of it within 2 weeks. He really loved it though so it kept him entertained. However, since we allow our dog on our bed, we ended up feeling several tiny pieces of the toy on our bed. So ok toy I guess for as long as it did last."
4,"Good product, bad descripton","My 1 year old border collie is an agressive chewer. This is one of the few toys that lasts in my home for more than a day. The only disappointing thing about this order was that the title says ""Dinosaur Varies,"" but I got 3 of the same dinosaur. And while you might think that my pup wouldn't know the difference, she doesn't seem as interested in this one as she was in the one that I have in another shape. Maybe because there is nowhere to grab that isn't pointy?"
3,Chew size should always be clearly listed,"I like this product as well as other nylabone products. The only problem is when I ordered this product, there was no clear posting of what size dog this product was for. The only comments I found were ""for powerful chewers."" I ordered the product and it arrived on time. It was then that I saw the small print in the lower left hand corner of the packaging stating that it was for dogs up to 50 pounds. My dog is almost 70 pounds.I notice that they have finally posted the ""for dogs up to 50lbs"" on the description. I only wist they had done this before."
3,Dogs do not use,My dogs do not seem to use this much. They seem to like the chewable dentalBones from grocery store better
1,Think again....,Purchased this for my dog. She loved it but unfortunately it cut her mouth so it has been thrown away.
1,do not buy,this was too hard and wore down my puppy's teeth in one day. the spikes are very sharp and may actually cut your hand if you are tossing it for your dog. do not recommend this product at all. i threw it away.
4,good bone,"This bone is kind of small for my dogs huge mouth, but it is still great quality and hard to chew. It really lasts and cannot be broken into pieces."
5,Great Product,I got the chew tot in and it was exactly what was advertised. I would use this vendor for future purchases.
1,It's a brick,This is not a toy. It feels and weighs like a small white brick with thorns. If i had not thrown away the packaging I would have returned for a refund. Don't waste your money!
1,very misleading advertisement!,"I should have read the reviews on this, as I, too, thought I would get 3 dinosaurs given the picture and the word ""assorted."" When I called customer service to complain, they said ""assorted"" means they choose for you which of the three assorted you will receive. While they wouldn't send me additional bones, they credited me $3.00 and were very polite in handling my complaint."
1,Bad dog toy,My 50lb dog chewed this toy for 3 days and his gums started bleeding. This toy has too many sharp corners and is not suitable.
2,"Cute, but puppies didn't use it.","This item was cute, but had absolutely no appeal to the 2 five month old Labs I have. They picked it up once and that was it. Basically, money wasted!The company offered to take them back, but the postage would cost about the same as the item, so I declined.Note: I've purchased several of the Nylabone products (toys to bones, etc.) for my pups, from 10 weeks old to their current 7 months, they have yet to use any of them at all.Might work for some, but I ended up giving them all to the humane society."
2,what!?,I wanted a T-REX and I got a Stegosaurus.. seriously guys get with your local archeologist and get your ancient reptiles straight! Puppy lost it within 25 mins... BAD DOG!
3,Not Ideal if You Have Carpet,"The pup liked this toy very much, but I do not recommend if you have any type of carpet in your house. We don't even have carpet - just a few wool rugs, but the toy was soon the most disgusting thing in our house. All the rug fibers and dirt and slobber matted around the nubs on this toy, making it very unpleasant to touch. We tossed it outdoors, and it wasn't much better. Those nubs grab everything gross and use slobber as glue to make sure that it stays that way."
2,unexpected size for reg size/large dogs,"I had ordered this expecting a slightly bigger toy considering it was a ""x-large"" toy. This toy is great for small dogs like poodles or something like that, but this was too small for my dog (average size mixed/mutt dog) and the head lasted one day before that was gone. Very disappointed considering I have alot of good to say about nylabone products. Hope to see a better/bigger dinosaur toy soon."
3,Wish they made this in dura chew durability,"My two American bulldogs love Nylabones. I originally purchased one of these at a local pet store, but the stronger chewer of the two ate the stegosaurus tail. My other do did love this so much that i ordered another to stay with her when shes in her crate. Definitely not their most durable, but still enjoyed by my dogs."
5,Very good item,Very very durable item. My dog loves this and can't tear it up. She will just chew and chew on it.
4,"Good bone, but not for larger dogs","I normally buy the Large, super durable Nylabones for my 35lb shepherd mix. However these were on sale so I decided to give one a try. Both of my dogs LOVED this bone as soon as it arrived. However, it is much smaller and softer than the bones I normally buy, and it did not take long at all before it had been chewed into something to small for my dog to safely continue chewing on. If you have smaller dogs who don't have a shepherd's powerful jaw, then this bone is for you."
5,Dogs a Chewing,If you have a Dog that likes to chew these will become your best friend! I have a Parson Russell ( Jack Russell Family) and he is a Heavy Chewer. He Loves these Denta-Dinos!
4,Nylabones Are Great,We love nylabones around our home. Our two goldens must have the durable nylabone as they quickly destroy a flexible one. I thought that this Dinosaur Nylabone was the bigger size since it said Wolf but it was pretty small at 4 inches. I had to give it to my friend's cocker spaniel. It was just too small for a golden retriever.
2,Not As Pictured or Described,The item I received was NOT as pictured or Described. The Dino Was Much Smaller. Did NOT meet my Expectations.
1,My two dogs would not chew these.,My dogs are 2 and 8 years old. They had no interest in these bones. Perhaps a puppy who has a strong urge to chew would like these. They have no smell and are a slick plastic texture.
2,Not crazy about,Will give to my bigger dogs. I thought it was a smaller chew toy for the puppy. The only problem is that my larger dogs are older and don't chew on things like they did when they were a puppy.
5,chew toy-,This is a good chew toy for a teething puppy.. Yes it is smaller then what i thought it was going to be but it is still something good to keep him busy with until his eyes set on something else... But it has held up so far with out any big pieces missing so i would order it again if i had to... also the package came on time as promised..
5,Perfect dog toy,These dinos are a good bet for a real chewer. I have 3 dogs and they LOVE these. They last a long time and are a great deal for the money. Only down side is they are a bit sharp if you step on them by mistake!
5,Great Investment,"My welsh corgi loves this bone, and my 3 year old nephew (who is a dinosaur lover) loves throwing it for him too."
1,Not what they say,"This is suppose to be one of there tuffest bones. Our dog had it 5 minutes and she had it broken apart into tiny sharp shards. 24 hours later we had to rush her to the emergency vet only to find out part of this toy was blocking here intestine. Stay away form this toy, or you may have a huge vet bill like we did, $3000 to remove a chunk the size of your pinky."
1,Destroyed in Minutes,"I was so excited to get this toy because it is very cute. We got the Stegosaurus version of the toy, and as soon as I opened the package my dog was just as excited as I was. Up until this point she had been barking at the UPS man who delivered it!This toy says it is designed for active chewers up to 50lbs. My 5 year old Clumber Spaniel is a very active chewer, and weighs 50lbs - I thought it was perfect! However, within twenty minutes, she had chewed it to the point where it looked like a giant wad of used bubble gum."
2,If you want white plastic pieces all over your floor - get it,"After a week of having them..... Really don't care for this product. My dogs (2 4 year old mixed breed) were not excited about them. The girl had her's for all of about 3-4 minutes, then said thanks but no thanks and walked away. The boy chewed for about 7-8 minutes, then had enough. They stayed on the floor for them to enjoy at anytime, but they rarely have. And when they did chew them - well, I had small hard white pieces all over my rug. Needless to say, can't walk barefoot on the rug.Sorry I made this purchase - especially at the price ! I do not recommend this product."
5,Lyla88,"FALSE advertisement. It says dinosaur varies but you should be able to chose.. Either way, my puppies still loved it!"
2,None of my dogs like it!,"I have three dogs. Two cocker spaniels and a jack russell terrier. None of them like this toy. They have had several Nylabone toys, but this one is the least favorite. Each of them tried it out, but they all got bored with it fast. It is very heavy and the points are somewhat sharp. That may not be what turns my dogs off though because they have had other textured toys. After handling it myself, I would be worried about it being to coarse and causing bleeding gums or injuring their teeth."
2,Hurts to handle,"This thing is made of a really hard/dense material (some kind of plastic, probably, instead of rubber) and so it is impossible for the dog to really ""chew"" it. Also, it's got sharp little bumps along it's body, so it actually hurts to pull on it when playing tug-of-war with your dog."
1,Leaves many pieces of white all over the house.,Not as durable as the neutral colored nylabones from Walmart. Would not recommend for a real chewer. Wish I could return for my money back.
2,Dog did not like it,I like it but my dog does not it is cute though The cost was fair He just did not like it
4,Awesome Dinosaur Chew Toy,"I loved this toy so much but my pup is a very aggressive chewer. Unfortunately, he had the head chomped down within a week or so. That said, I find nylabone to have great products and ended up purchasing a big nylabone bone which has stood up to his chewing."
4,Popular,"This one is a winner, nice and hard for my larger dogs to chew on. I find nylabones a great option for my dogs, as they don't fight over them like they would something edible. They take turns chewing on this, and it looks like it will take a while for them to get through it. A good buy."
2,I wanted a t-rex,I thought I was ordering a t-rex. :( I think they should have the first photo with all dino options.
3,Smaller than I thought,"For some reason I thought this was much larger than what it was when I got it. Nonetheless, my dogs both love this and though they don't fight over it, this is the preferred chew toy. One is always looking to steal it away when the other is not looking. Keeps them very busy."
1,Not for Small Dogs,My little dog is an avid chewer. I thought this product would give him something stable to chew. The dinosaur is made of extremely hard plastic. It is too large for a small mouth. The chewing bumps on the dino are sharp. My dog cannot play with this at all. I would not recommend this for anyone with a smaller dog.
1,"Not sure these are safe, big chunks break off","I have a number of Nylabones that are natural in color and 5 years old. Our dog died 4 years ago and we kept the misc supplies. Now we have a new lab and she loves the natural ones, which she basically wears down slowly.We also had some white nylabones that hadn't been used and our lab almost eats them. First we saw pieces about the size of 1/4 a rice in her feces. Then I found her with a piece about the size of a dime in her mouth. It was irregular and did not look like something that would pass easily.We chucked the white ones and now I'm trying to find the good ones.Not so easy since websites show pictures of both so I'm not certain what we'd get.I would never give my dog these white Nylabones.I did not buy Nylabones here. I'm searching for a source of the good ones that don't break into large chunks.I asked for advice at the Nylabone site but have not heard from them."
1,Cute Dinosaur Not Cute Dog Teeth,"When I gave this to my dog he instantly went to town. As I sat and watched him I noticed the white t-rex had cut my dog's mouth from the sharp edges. He is an aggressive chewer and didn't want to see it go, but it really required too much supervision than I felt comfortable with."
5,Best chew toy,This is the only chew toy that consistently holds my dogs' attention. And it's good for their gums and teeth. I stock up on them every year.
5,Extinct Dinosaurs,"I have two golden retrievers and 5 Nylabone dinosaurs in the house - at least temporarily, for the dinosaurs that is. These are, paws down, the absolute favorite chew toy in our house. They are easy for the dogs to handle, carry around, fling around and chew. I might as well order a gross for the upcoming year."
3,Smaller than Expected,Unfortunately its hard to estimate size with these toys but I went by a ladies comment on how her labs loved it. Thinking that labs made this toy last I thought my two pit mixes would do the same. It was half chewed in just a couple of days. Nylabone toys are great all around but if you have big chewers I would look for a jumbo size.
4,Great for big chewers.,This dino bone has been a great chew toy. I'm not so sure about the dental aspect. I haven't noticed any difference in the plaque buildup. It has saved some of the kid's toys by keeping the dog busy so it was a good purchase.
5,Common sense,"Okay, I had to speak up. Hello, common sense and directions on toys. ONE) choose a toy that is large enough to encourage dogs to chew using their side/back teeth. You DO NOT want a toy that is small enough for dogs to use their front teeth or likely they will crack their front teeth, ect. So even if the toy says is is meant for large dogs, pay attention to how your dog chews on it. If they're chewing with their front teeth, take it away and try the next size up. TWO) Yes, toys sometimes do say for powerful chewers. If your dog is tearing off large chunks of the toy, TAKE IT AWAY. DO NOT LET YOUR DOG KEEP IT THEN ACT SURPRISED THAT YOUR DOG IS HAVING DIGESTION PROBLEMS. Nylabone toys are meant for dogs to take off tiny slivers at a time, no bigger than a grain of rice. I don't care what ""strength the chew toy is"", if it's not strong enough for you dog, take it away and try a larger/tougher toy.All of this is common sense, but in case that escaped you, it's also on the directions."
3,Not made for large dogs that love to chew,Our boxer had chewed the nubs off within 5 minutes. Loved to toss it around but not safe! Hits the tile floor very loud as well!
2,ONLY 38 MINUTES OF MUSIC!,"This CD is a rip off. Only 38 minutes of music. Furthermore, only half of the songs are worth listening to. Save your money and buy ""Nina Simone's Finest Hour"" or the two disc ""Anthology"" CD set."
4,It's Not A Compilation!!!,"I think the reviewers who are criticizing the short length of this CD are missing the point slightly. I know there are lots and lots of compilations of Nina Simone's work but this is NOT one of them. It is a reissue of her original 1967 album. If you want to hear passionate, raw and powerful blues songs in their original context as meant by Ms. Simone, this album is for you. If you are new to her and want to have the most bang for your buck (and who doesn't?), by all means skip this one and choose one of those many compilations."
2,Not even close to being a complete overview,"While I agree with the reviewer who criticized the album for its short length, I dislike this album primarily because of the selections. In her liftetime, Nina Simone recorded many blues songs, only a mediocre handful of which are represented here. However, there are a few gems, such as ""I Want a Little Sugar in My Bowl"" and 'House of the Rising Sun"" and ""Do I Move You?."" Only buy if you can get it for under 5 dollars."
4,The best songs of Lisa!!!,For me Electric and Lately are the best songs of Lisa!!! I'd like this single but I'm little disappointed that there isn't a video of Electric...I saw it on Youtube! It's very sexy!!!!
4,stylish,"Exactly as described. Very stylish, slight disappointment in the strength of the clasp and limited adjustment for wrist size."
2,Lots of show but little meat,"Luc pulled some strings to put this video together. Visually its very nice. Lots of candid hockey and TV/Film stars. Enjoyed the section on how equipment is made. Its a good video for someone wanting to look at playing hockey from the 5000 foot mark. As for education of hockey, drills and anything which you may look at as a coach, its almost useless. The very few drills that are done are difficult to view due to un-needed special effects. If you looking for a ""coaching"" or player improvement video, look at the Power Roller Hockey series."
4,WOW!!!!!!,"If you wanted a copy of the Menudo LP ""Los Ultimos Heroes"" on CD, now is your chance.The entire 1990 release is here in CD form (back around the time it was released, it was available primarily in LP or cassette format--I don't recall seeing it on Cd though.This time around, along with 2 remastered remixes--both of which were a pleasant surprise (all I can say is that in the remixes, the guys vocal prowesses are impressive indeed, especially Angelo and Rawy.)I would have given it 5 stars, but after listening to this, it left me wanting more from LUH. After the May 2002 concert (which I couldn't go too), there were talks of DVD concert footage, tours and future Cd's, but nothing came to fruition. :^(Oh, before I go, if you are an old Menudo fan, especially of the late 1980's - 1990's era, get this CD!"
3,este no es tan bueno,a mi en lo personal este cd de menudo no me gusto mucho porque ya menudo en esta epoca estaba cambiando no era lo mismo
5,AMAZING!!!,"This is such a wonderful CD!!! The last two remixes on here will blow you away!!! They are starting up another tour here in a few weeks with a new CD and DVD this time (so said Sergio :o)!)! I can not wait! But if you have never heard them, this is a great way to break you in! lol I loved this (LP) when it frist came out in '89 and to have it on CD with the remixes, it's just wonderful! Angelo and Robert just blew me away with how powerful their voices have become!!!! So what ya waitin' for? If you LOVE GREAT music,this is THE ONE CD to have!"
3,Dream is just OK,"I heard a couple of tracks off this CD and thought it might be a good buy, but the rest of the CD has no personality."
4,very 80s and dated but great stuff,"This was a blast from the past for me as I remember hearing Jones's Things Can Only Get Better as a chart hit in the mid 80s. The album is dated and one can immediately identify the age, but it is good and has a lot of catch tunes that do work for me.Recommended!!!"
5,Classic 80's,"Since you can't find the entire album on iTunes, i decided to go against modernity and buy the physical CD. It arrived it perfect condition, and i was able to listen to the album from my youth that i so loved. Highly recommend it..."
4,Dream Into Action,Great Howard Jones CD. It has many of his better known songs and hits on it. Great product from a trusted seller.
5,Message To Goth Hick,Action Replay was never released on CD. You can probably find some of those remixes on Howard Jones' recent compilations. Check out www.howardjones.com.
5,The best,"When I was 12 years old,I used to listen to this tape over and over again while dancing with my date (a broom). It gave me such pleasure and happiness to sing these lyrics with HoJo that no foolishness would ever compromise these songs.Now when I pop it in the player I wax nostalgic to my husband, who never heard of him. I know my son will enjoy HOJO's music since it transcends time and place."
3,Not good for night pictures..,"Good Shipping. Well packaged, the problem lies with the product. The zoom is nothing to talk about, what a waste, you're better off buying a higher lens, 3x or 5x. I take allot of night shots and with this lens on all my shots come out dark, becasue the lens is so bloody big it blocks out the flash from camera. All the native night shots from camera without lens attached are brilliant. I dont like this lens."
3,Good little addition,"This is worth the money for the added length, but beware that when fully extended there is significant non-natural blurring around the edges of the photo. I used it on my Kodak Z650. For the price, I'm still glad I bought it, but not very ideal for professional looking photos."
1,Don't bother with this product,"I was thrilled with the idea of bringing my optical zoom up to 20x. I tried it a few times randomly and wasn't too disappointed until I tested it to see exactly how much extra zoom it provides. At the most, maybe this could qualify as a 1.1x extra zoom. If you're looking to buy this lens, just move a half step closer to your subject and you'll be doing better than with this lens.Aside from doing almost nothing towards the entire point of it's existance, it's bulky and with the lens attached it causes a ring of darkness around your shot until you zoom in a bit, so it's useless for anything other than zoomed shots.Picture quality didn't change, but I did experience the autofocus problem a few times depending on the distance of the subject.Save your money."
1,Not-so-great telephoto lens,"This lens is really poor quality.Makes your photos look like they were taken with a toy camera with a plastic lens. Lots of distortion.I would not buy it again, nor recommend."
1,Opteka 2.2x HD Telephoto Lens for Kodak EasyShare Z650 Z740,"This was a waste of money, you can actually purchase a telephoto lens made my the same people that makes the lens for Kodak. I bought this lens, its too bulky, it makes your photos hazy and blurry. I would not recommend buying this."
3,"Good, but not great","This isn't my favorite Aeoliah CD, but it's worth keeping. I don't find it as soothing as Angel Love I or II, which are hard acts to follow! Good background music for reading, impossible for meditation or to fall asleep to."
4,STRONG-EFFECTIVE BASS,"""Incredible fast shipping, good item. But installation hardware was absent, and the carrying wood box was broken.I would be informed about the customs and tax prices of Turkey via UPS.I had to give significant extra money for customs and tax price. I would like to have the original installation hardware, becouse; for up a week i'm looking for a strong hardware to carry the 62 pounds. Thanks at all..."""
1,Doesn't Work,"This stuff is nonsense. It does not work at all. I wasted $23 on a bottle, it is a thicker consistency than regular power steering fluid. But it still leaks the same as before.Food for though, the power steering system runs on a HIGH PRESSURE HOSE, this fluid will not do anything for that.My car is a 98 Maxima."
1,No Bueno. This product did not work as advertised,I bought to bottles made sure i followed the instructions and now i have to pay the mechanic $750 to resolve the issue. I just hope I can get my money back
5,Guarantee is for real.,"I give this item a 5-star because the manufacturer really does refund your money if the product doesn't work exactly as stated on the bottle. I got a refund check for two bottles by sending the receipts for the purchase along with the bar code off of the bottle to the address on the Lucas website. It would be inappropriate to rate the product poorly because the car had a hole in one of the power steering fluid lines, and it was just too big for this product to repair."
1,2 bottles did not work,Wasted money I will see if they honor the refund but this did not work it just left a nice stain on my driveway with a very very slow leak issue I thought this would fix it. It did not.
3,Did not work for me,"Audi.Car has a slow leak, about 1.0qt ever year.This product did help slow down the leak a bit, maybe down to 70% of the original leak rate.From the look of the product, it's just a VERY viscous oil. Nothing magical. Thicker oil/More Lucas = slower leak.Locus did send a refund check when requested."
3,Stops Leaks - Doesn't Stop Sounds!,"This product claims to stop leaks and stop ""squeals"". In my experience, this product did indeed stop LEAKS, but the squealing was only VERY SLIGHTLY diminished. I have a dry steering rack, which it claims to also help with, however there were still sounds coming from that after using this product. If you need a great product to stop LEAKS, get this, but if you're looking for the sound to stop too, try another product I would say."
5,Fixed our leak.,Used this product on a 1991 Nissan Stanza for the power steering leak. Worked great. Have had good luck with Lucas Products.
1,Does not work!!,"This stuff is nonsense. It does not work at all. I wasted $23 on a bottle, it is a thicker consistency than regular power steering fluid. But it still leaks the same as before.Food for though, the power steering system runs on a HIGH PRESSURE HOSE, this fluid will not do anything for that.My car is a 98 Maxima."
4,good but probably not as great as the claims are,"It did slow down the leaking, but I am not sure if it stopped it yet... I will probably need to use the third bottle in a week or two... (it is some general leak, not a big one)"
2,Not even CLOSE to Tom Clancy's best,"I was disappointed in writing style, having read the review of Lin Todd of Global Risk, I expected Clancyesq or better-and I mean the Real Tom Clancy, not the associated ""other authors"". I mean, this is not a Red October by any means."
3,Author is Gen. AJ Tata,"The cat is out of the bag (has been for months). I don't know why Amazon hasn't linked this book with Sudden Threat (the prequel to this story), but they haven't. Rocke is the pseudonym Tata went by while still in theatre.I don't think these are the best military novels, but not bad either."
4,Splendid!,"Anyone interested in trial advocady will find this a terrific introduction. Notice how Barry Slotnik, Goetz's attorney, seizes control of the courtroom, completely intimidating the prosecutor. The famous and controversial ""shoe incident"" is beautifully protrayed; just how clear is it that the witness intended to throw the shoe at Slotnik. This is a tape that is well worth owning."
2,I should have taken this system back for a different make.,"My old Awia system that i purchased back in '96 was a better system. Features I didn't like on the Panasonic was the remote, which is small and the buttons are too close together. The signal is weak which require repeated pressing of buttons. The CD changer is noisy and to take out one CD you have to stop the playing CD. A carousel would have been better. Loading CD's is a task and retrieving is also difficult. And still very noisy. I don't recommed purchasing this model as there are better ones out there that can do the same job."
2,"Good sound, lousy functionality","I read a bunch of reviews and tried this minisystem. The sound is very good and the price was right. It was easy to put together and looks very slick.The funcionality is poor, though. The remote control doesn't control everything, so I find myself walking to the unit at least half the time. The CD changer is unbelievable noisy and slow! I may as well change the CDs myself. And, there's no way to tell which CD is in which spot. When my son wants to hear his blues CD, I have to cycle through all five, and several noisy minutes later I finally find it.All in all, definitely not the way to go."
4,Panasonic SC AK 33,"This product is excellent, it has a nice round bass, well defined mid range, and a tickingly high treble, listen to your old CD's you will hear things that u never heard before. It is extremely clear, I still think it need a little more power though my last stereo was an Awia (250 watts) it was good and very loud and only heald 3 CDs. I dont like the fact that the cassette player doesn't have auto reverse nor continuous play i also found it tedious to change the CD's, that's why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 stars. but on the whole it is a much more clearer sound than the Awia"
3,Hatcher's Notebook not current,"Great information but, I thought the 2012 edition would have been updated from the 1949 edition. This is an antiquated text with good info about older firearms and ballistics data is still good."
1,Very Disappointing,"My grown children fondly remember their first scratch and sniff books, and I had hoped to present my granddaughter with a similar fun book. The smells presented were very faint and except for the candy cane, almost indistinguishable. The pictures were not Christmasy nor was the story line. A very poor choice."
1,Scratch and smell nothing,"I was very disappointed in the scratch and sniff parts of this book. The smells are very faint and non-descript. If you are looking for scratch and sniff books, I would say to skip this one, and go with the DK books, Scratch & Sniff Food, and Scratch & Sniff Garden."
3,Cats are over it,"My cats thought this was the dumbest thing ever. They sat there and watched the bubbles drift to the ground and break. Then they laid down in the liquid catnip and got what they wanted. I felt violated. I wanted to watch them chase bubbles. Instead they just looked at me like, ""Who do you think I am?"" My cats are clearly drug addicts."
4,One out of 2 cats approve!,"My male cat loves these bubbles, but he loves playing with bubbles anyway. My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles. This formula makes LOTS of bubbles! And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip. This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat! There is a slight smell, but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells). I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip. He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
3,Not impressed.,"My cat likes these bubbles ok I guess. He kind of just sits and watches them fall...then swats a few times and gets bored. He is 3 months old and has TONNNNS of energy, but these don't really impress him much. They smell horrid....so if you don't like the pungent smell of liquid catnip DO NOT BUY THESE! Great concept though."
1,Disappointed.,"My cat Basil is a huge catnip addict, he will find the package, and try to open it in the middle of the night if I don't place it out of sight. I was excited when I saw this int he store thinking he would love it, but quite the contrary, he hated it. It must not of smell like the real stuff to him. He was totally turned off. If you have a cat who is a fiend like mine, is, nothing make up for the real thing!!!"
2,Eh,"Cat thought the bubbles were interesting, but didn't go crazy over them. They smell funny, leave a residue, and don't maintain form when they touch down as advertised. I'll go pick up a big bottle of regular bubbles for him to chase. Not worth the price."
5,Catnip Bubbles,"My cats really loved these! I have some cute pictures and videos of them chasing them! Adorable! After they are done playing, they roll all over the carpet! It's a fun centerpiece when friends come over!"
2,No dice!,"My cat will sit and watch the bubbles, maybe even approach a group of them while they are falling, but he won't pop them. Sometimes he even acts scared of them, which I personally think is bologna. For the price, you can find a cooler toy for your kitty."
1,My cats are scared. ;^;,"Yes my cats are scared, all three of them.Susy i thought would probly be scared. (She is scared of everything)Danny gets very nervous when ever i blow them,But Misu I realy dident expect her to be scared. o_o; She is the bravest cat i know.And then i brought it over to a frends house, and his two cats where scared too! ;^;"
3,Better than her nuclear rants,This one is rational as she sticks to areas where she has some knowledge. Does a good job of highlighting problems without offering effective solutions.All of her work is affected by her hysterical fear of clean reliable nuclear energy.
1,This knife is useless,"For starters both issues mentioned by previous reviewers are correct, that is this knife is way too small for adult hands, and it is of poor quality and a bad design. The size would not be that much of an issue since it is correctly described, and were it not for the other problems, could be a decent starter knife for a 8-10 yo boy. However, my son practiced opening and closing it for a few minutes and from that alone the tiny little spring that's supposed to lock the blade was bent out of shape permanently so the blade doesn't lock anymore. A blade that doesn't lock securely in place is dangerous. This should not be allowed to happen.Note: before anyone freaks out, yes my son was directly supervised by me the whole time, and no he didn't cut himself or anyone/anything else.Bottom line is there are much better knives on Amazon for about the same price or a little more. Save yourself the trouble and buy something that will work longer than a few minutes."
1,Complete waste,This knife started to fall apart within days. The nut that lets you flick it open fell out for starters. Then the handle started to come apart. I would never buy another.
5,This is a fabulous tool for today's busy people.,"Jane Alexander's hardcover book, ""Rituals for Sacred Living"", is a beautifully illustrated and arranged book to calm and focus we busy people living in the fast-paced world of today. In eight brief chapters she explains ""sacred living"", and how to connect you with yourself and the Universe. Other chapter titles include: ""Your home as a reflection of the soul, ""Sacred areas in the home"", ""Mealtime rituals"", ""Spiritual cleansing"", ""Releasing negative energy"", ""Sacred sexuality"" and ""Celebrating life's cyles."" This book is lavishly illustrated, with full color photos or drawings on each page. The feeling I was left with was of great reverence and enthusiasm for life, whether Alexander was gently pointing out the underlying benefits of the easy self-discipline lessons, or the meaningful enjoyments of daily living. The hardcover-only edition will assist in preserving this rich and ripe guide. Enjoy! Give generously as gifts as well as to your self."
3,Don't watch this with your parents! Shockingly boring!!,"The gloves are taken off for this limey video, as it breaks new ground in everything from male frontal nudity to unnatural sex acts. As avant' guard as they would like to seem, the characters are unrealistic, their reactions to situations unbelievable. 2 hours is way too long for this flick, I had to watch this movie in 3 chunks, to keep from falling asleep. Save your money for a better movie."
3,I'm a Bit Puzzled,"When a movie's first 10 minutes stirs my curiosity about what it's trying to say or how it will end, I continue watching. This movie did both. I may be one of the few who haven't seen Fellini's famous 8 1/2, so I looked for a description of that movie. Can this one be a takeoff on it? This movie did seem to wander. I liked that this one delivered a blow to the nudity double standard. I will view it again."
1,Major Disappointment,"After seeing Vivian Wu's performance in the movie Pillow Book, which was exceptionally great, I expected a similar performance in 8 1/2 Women. Unfortunately, this is a movie without much of a plot that has as much (if not more) male nudity as female nudity. An example of this was during the funeral of the wife of one of the main characters, who stripped down completely when he was told he couldn't wear white at the funeral. It made absolutely no sense. I was hoping that the DVD would have some deleted scenes that could have made the movie more interesting, but there weren't any. A major disappointment, both for Vivian Wu fans (she had only a small role in the movie, with no love/sex scenes) and movie buffs in general."
1,Don't buy this,God this movie was awful. it was confusing and stupid. I could barely follow or understand what what happening. I only bought it because Toni Collette was in it. It was a waste of money!!
2,where's nyman?,"I still haven't made it through this one. After ""Pillow Book"" I was so looking forward to the next Greenaway film. This one did not satisfy. The absense of a musical score is like John Waters filming in Chicago!?"
3,uhm o.k.?,"Lynne:If it's possible to make a film that could be deemed ""enjoyably bad""; do you think its possible to do the opposite?Don:What you mean ""unenjoyably good?""Lynne:Yes.Don:Uhm,well--(DOORBELL RINGS)Lynne:Excuse me for a moment.Don:Well no I don't(brief pause) to be quite honest.(Lynne without hesitation pulls open the front door revealing the filmmaker Peter Greenaway framed by the late afternoon's fleshy glow.STUDIO APPLAUSE.Greenaway holds for the applause with a knowing smirk before entering the doorway.)Peter:I respectfully beg to differ motherf***er.STUDIO APPLAUSE"
1,It's Greenaway! Avoid.,"Two people are responsible for the death of the British film industry. One was Derrick Jarman ( now deceased ) and the other is Peter Greenaway. Pretentious art school twaddle. Avoid anything by Mr Greenaway. Run a mile. Heck run two. There should be a crime of ""excessive misuse of celluloid""."
4,Check the Plates,"This is a wonderful book combined with an extraordinary collection of plates. The only problem is that virtually all the references in the text do not refer to the correct plates. This is really disappointing is such a fine, and expensive, book."
5,Magnifique,"The Anatomy of Glory is a wonderful account of Napoleon's Guard, from its beginnings during the Revolutionary Wars to its end after Waterloo. The text is highly readable and engaging. The accompanying prints are wonderful, as are the useful appendices. I would recommend this to any student of Napoleonic history. The Tondu and his Grumblers seem to march across the pages of this seminal text."
5,Creative Abundance,A great little book to go with The Secret - affirmations is the way to go. Love - MG
5,The FAVORITE toy,"These ducks have been our Jack Russells favorite toy for years. My local pet store doesn't carry them anymore so I have purchased several online to keep a stash. They do have to be washed and occasionally a hole stiched up or a foot sewn back on, (he likes to shake them) but it's worth it. He has a box full of other plush toys but this duck is his preference 9 out of 10 times. I will be sad the day that these ducks are no longer available, the joy they bring my dog is undescribable!!!!!"
3,Duck worth,"I bought this toy to replace an old one My dog had. He didn't want anything to do with it, so I gave it to my other dog. She played with it for a while and then abandoned it."
3,"Good toy, NOT good for chewers!","We got this for our new (adopted) 90 pound rottie. and he LOVED IT! he loved it so much the stuffing and squeaker where out int the first hour. Now a day later he still like it and tosses it around but it is very limp. would be a great toy for a dog who doesn't chew much, only reason I gave it 3 stars is because its average. great toy, my dog loved it (still does), not good for chewers!"
3,Great to look at,"Great to look at, but cumbersome to play with extendedly. More for looks and laughes. The supposed motion activate that raises Leon's gun doesnt work. If your a Resident Evil fan and collector, this is a great addition to your collection. If your looking for a game controller, this isnt your best option."
4,It's a Collectors item! NOT A CONTROLLER,"I think the title makes it quite clear. It looks beautiful, it would make a great gift for hardcore resident evil fan.As for a usable ps2 controller its impossible to use and very cumbersome.I still love it though."
2,short but still tiresome,"The small amount of action in this story is lengthened into description after description of the narrator doing drugs and drinking while altering classic movies. You really want to shout ""OK, I get the idea, already! Would you please move on???""Finally we get to the climax, and it's not much. There is no suspense, more of just an explanation of how the would-be dancer Alis has mysteriously appeared in some of the old movies. It's a required SF explanation (so that the story can be called SF) but really it's hard to be curious when you just want the thing to end, please -- by this point in the story you know it's not going to get any more interesting.It seems that Willis put all her energy into coming up with the SF premise and watching old movies so she could insert little descriptions of scenes into the text. It needed more attention to the characters and a plot. This would have made a passable short story."
3,Not my favorite Connie Willis,"I have to say that I found this book sadly wanting. It was definately not up to Ms Willis' usual standard. It seemed rushed and quite frankly flat. Disappointing as she is such a good writer, usually.The characters are not warm or likeable, I felt no empathy for them at all. A lot was made of continual, chronic drug use, which didn't seem to aid or add to the plot at all. Sorry Connie but I just didn't like it."
2,A disappointed Willis Fan,"Being a big Connie Willis Fan it grieves me deeply to give anything she writes a bad review. It is obvious that she did a tremendous amount of movie research before writing this and she did enlighten me on a lot of trivia about some of my favorite movies. Yet, the book in itself, was boring and a big disappointment."
1,Disappointing Quality,"Cribbage is a fun game and this would have been a lovely gift but the quality of the product was really poor. The wood wasn't finished and is a much lighter color than the advertised photo. There's no clasp to keep the case closed when traveling. The folding cribbage board is much larger than expected. The dimensions ought to be included in its description. In general, it was a big disappointment."
4,This book needs a product warning.,"In order to use this book effectively you must have a sextant. I was disappointed when I read the first chapter, which I found to be easy to read and very clearly and simply stated, when I turned to chapter two only to find that it was a technical guide to adjusting your sextant. This is a practical work and you can only use this book effectively with a sextant in your hand. But that in itself is no bad thing...if you have a sextant."
1,Wrong application,"Wrong application as labeled, will not adapt a aftermarket stereo to a factory antenna cable"
1,Wrong Part,This part did not fit my truck so you can imagine my frustration when I spend 8 hours taking out the transfer case and transmission just to find out the damn clutch doesn't fit. I had to drive almost 2 hours and pay twice as much for a clutch that would actually fit. I'm sending this back and I hope that you can at least reimburse me for shipping and a full refund for the part.
3,Apple M9321G/B Mini-DVI to DVI,"This cable only provides Digital DVI and not Analog.It should provide both.The problem arises if one did not purchase a DVI-Digital ONLY cable, it will not plug in. Good thing a reviewer provided a picture of the DVI plug showing it will not accept a DVI (digital and analog) plug."
4,Does what it says,Pros:-A must have for small screen laptop users-Mac OSX has amazing multi-screen supportCons:-Very short-Slightly expensive for an adapter
2,Who Designs These Things?,"It'd be churlish to blame this adapter itself, but there is one niggling issue which I wish to comment upon:Whomever decided to create such a ""swappable"" design for the MiniDisplay Port itself should be shot.If this thing is used to attach a cord of any decent length, which may or may not be subject to gravitational forces; or, the computer itself gets moved; then you will have to constantly check to ensure it is still attached.Apple, get your head out your butt and just start using HDMI. Why do you have to create another ADC-type port to divide the marketplace?"
3,"Good product, Why 3, don't fill my hdtv 1080p","I bought this product because I wanted to view my macbook in my Panasonic HDTV 1080p at 1920x1080 px , but this product don't fill the TV like PS3 does, it put the high resolution but let one inch of margin in all the sides of the TV,Is expensive for a adapter and if you want to put you mac on a VGA monitor need to buy another adapter, even if you want to put a movie in a old TV have to buy other adapter, its a shame that apple don't make this directly to HDMI because you need to buy a DVI-D Male to HDMI."
4,"Expensive, but it works","I need an adapter to connect my monitor to my mac. The adapter could be longer, especially after spending $30 on the adapter. If you can find another non-apple adapter I would purchase it. The adapter works great though."
3,"Cuts out, not Apple Brand","If I didn't want the Apple brand I would have ordered not Apple brand. Not sure if it's the adapter, the cable, or my TV but every time I attempt to use the TV as a second monitor now it works fine for a little while and then suddenly the TV switches inputs from DVI to PC and says, ""hey nothing's plugged in"" (well duh, you're looking in the wrong port) Very frustrating."
1,Awful Purchase,"Was not labeled correctly online. Does not work with my computer and is not what was supposed to be sent. Took way too long to deliver and is now past the 30 days mark to return for a refund. Very unhappy with Amazon, Apple and whomever sold this product online since it is NOT legitimate and does not work."
1,WARNING for Macbook Pro to Cintiq connections,"This adapter will not work with my new Macbook Pro 17"" and it will not work with a Wacom Cintiq. The pinout on the DVI has too narrow a slot for the blade and does not have sockets for the four pins surrounding the blade on the Cintiq. The Mac end is too small for the socket on the Macbook Pro."
3,"Item Fine, Available Direct","FYI, as of this writing, you can get this directly from Apple for $19.00 + $4 S&H.; A better deal than shown here.Oh, and you'll probably need another cord for any practical use. I hooked it up w/ thisEforcity Black 2 Meter HDMI Male to DVI Male Cableand now can use my HDTV as a 2nd monitor. Very cool.Don't know why Apple doesn't just build in a regular DVI output or include this adapter. (Maybe to make more money?)"
3,works but is not authentic,"This adapter works, but after just a few days the cable started to tear away from the DVI end of the adapter. When I compared this to an adapter I bought from the Apple online store around the same time, it was obvious it was made cheaper and not authentic (even though it says ""by Apple""). Not a real quality product just spend a little more and get a better product from Apple ($24 with shipping)."
4,Just okay,"This is a single from the Cardigan's First Band on the Moon. The remixes included in this disc aren't great but they're not bad. I found the Been It remixes too similar though, they could've had more variety in that sense but they were still fun. I'm a Cardigan's fan so I think it was worth the purchase."
5,Very satisfied,I've got the book earlier than expected and althought it is a used one it arrived in very good conditions.
2,Due South Vol 1 was much better.,"I loved Due South Vol. 1....Vol. 2 has only 4 songs that appealed to me. One of them the ""Robert MacKenzie"" can be purchased as a single. A second song, the Due South Theme, is on the first CD. I was especially displeased with ""Cubically Contained"", by the Headstones. This song contained some very objectionable language and just didn't fit into the ""Due South"" image. Just didn't care for this CD."
2,**DITTO**,"I agree with many of the other reviewers. This is an unusual CD. Some songs were good, some okay, and a few I didn't care for. One song has explicit language - disappointing to see on a Due South CD. I bought it mainly for ""Robert MacKenzie"", which I enjoy more each time I hear it. An alright soundtrack, but not quite what I had hoped for. Probably worth the money for the 8 or so good songs on it - especially if you're a Due South Fan!"
5,Quite definitely one of my favorite CDs,"I really enjoyed this CD from the beginning to the end. It had many different styles of songs, most enjoyable, and in this setup it kept my attention through the whole CD. Personally, my favorite tracks were the first 4, including Drunken Sailor and Robert MacKenzie and Mind. I also liked From a Million Miles, and Sarah McLachlan's single. As a consolation to Due South ending, I highly recommend this CD!!"
3,Volume 1 is better.,"Like anyone who would be reading this, I am an avid fan of Due South, a program which does indeed utilise sound and music more effectively than any other I know of. That is the reason I bought the first soundtrack, which was a brilliant compilation, highlighting Canadian artists who I would otherwise never here. And that is also why I bought the second album. However, the music selected from the third series to go onto this CD is poor, and I feel it did not fully live up to my expectations. It is no that this album is bad, its just that the old one is so much better."
5,Great book for boys!,"This book is really, really great. It is funny, informative, and helps children to better understand and appreciate snakes. A good read for all pre-teens, and even adults who are interested or intrigued by snakes, or who have a child asking about getting one as a pet."
3,Sturdy but bad hardware,The license plate frame is nice but the plastic screws to install it were not strong and broke.
4,Happy motorhead!!,Bought for my 13 yr. old son who is a real motorhead and Kenworth lover! He loved it! It is a great item for the collector not durable enough for rough and tough play.
5,Grant Comes East,Awesome and captivating read.Couldn't put it down and a great twist of what could have happened. The writers take you back in time with the way the described every scene. It's like it just happened.
4,Not the worst book ever written,Better written then some not the best book on the concept I've ever read but not the worst either(anything by Harry Harrison on the subject gets that award). I think at times character development can suffer because of the authors need to write sweeping battle sceans.Overall-If this stuff is your thing go for it had me waiting for the next installment
2,Production was poor,"I got the audiobook for the first book in this series, Gettysburg, and it wasn't too bad, about 14 hours of entertainment if I remember correctly, This second audiobook though only had 6 hours and the production was very poor. Considering the material in written form is the same length as the first book, I was expecting a better script and I got what I should have expected for 6 hours worth of entertainment"
